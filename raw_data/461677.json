  "text": "<p>Peter\u2019s ribs hurt and the grocery store is closed.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper is still inside but when he taps on the door she just shakes her head at him. For a brief and mildly insane moment he contemplates just breaking the door down and then he gives himself a mental slap in the head and starts walking to the late-night crazy vegan organic grocer a couple of blocks down. It\u2019s only a short step from breaking down grocery doors to holding all of New York hostage and opening up a sucking vortex of doom to some mysterious alien realm. Peter has a Moral Compass and is determined to use it properly and not turn into one of those supervillains that keep cackling wickedly and threatening to conquer the city and defeat the Avengers by, like, seducing them or something. (This happens every other week, mostly to Tony Stark, and Peter\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s just because people like seducing Tony Stark.)</p>\n<p>He gives into temptation and uses his web-slingers to swing over to the organic grocer, even though he\u2019s not wearing his suit and he\u2019s almost out of web and everything hurts. By the time he gets there everything hurts even more and he just wants to curl up into a crevice and maybe die a little.</p>\n<p>The organic grocer\u2019s still open. The girl at the counter has purple hair and snakebite piercings and she smiles at him when he walks in. He gives her a smile that he\u2019s pretty sure looks kind of crazy and walks over to the eggs section. There\u2019s a guy in the way, a huge guy with ridiculous muscles and hair that looks too blonde to be real, and Peter waits for him to move but he doesn\u2019t. He just stands there staring at the eggs with this sort of lost, desperate look on his face. Peter can sympathise with him; there are a lot of different types of eggs and he usually gets the wrong ones. Usually Uncle Ben would tell him which ones to get but, well. Yeah.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, dude,\u201d he says eventually, after a self-indulgent couple of minutes spent ogling the guy\u2019s ass, \u201cnot that I\u2019m trying to interrupt your existential crisis, or, or whatever, but I just need to nip in and get some eggs and I\u2019ll be out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says the guy, startling, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be in the way,\u201d and he turns around and it\u2019s Captain America.</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head a little and wonders if the lizard antidote maybe has hallucinogenic properties. He pinches himself on the arm but no, Captain America\u2019s still there, blocking the grocery aisle and freaking out over eggs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Captain America,\u201d he blurts out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Captain America, looking a little wide-eyed. He casts a nervous glance at the girl at the counter \u2013 he has nothing to worry about there, she\u2019s rocking out to her iPod and could care less what they\u2019re talking about \u2013 and says, \u201cNo, uh, Steve, it\u2019s just, I\u2019m Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Peter, and then because his brain-to-mouth filter had apparently been completely destroyed in the fight on Oscorp Tower: \u201cHey, your butt really is as tight as it looks on TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>Captain America just kind of stares at him and then Peter realises what he just said and freezes on the spot. He just met Captain America, war hero, icon of truth and justice and really spangly outfits, and then ogled his ass. He ogled Captain America\u2019s ass and then <em>told him about it. </em>Peter is a terrible person and he is obviously destined for supervillainy. What is his life.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Thanks?\u201d says Cap weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Peter, and then his brain kind of blanks out and he darts around and grabs the first carton of eggs he can reach, and he hopes they\u2019re the right ones because he didn\u2019t even check but this place is organic so they\u2019re probably free range. He waves the carton in Captain America\u2019s face and then says, \u201cRight, well, I\u2019ll see you around. Except not. Because you\u2019re Captain America. Have fun saving the planet. Don\u2019t, you know, die or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap doesn\u2019t say anything. Actually he looks kind of dumbfounded, like someone hit him in the head with a heavy object. Peter all but runs to the counter and throws a random amount of money at the cashier. And then he walks home and it\u2019s raining but he\u2019s pretty sure most of it is still the antidote doing crazy things to the weather. The rain sticks to the back of his neck and he huddles into his hoodie but it doesn\u2019t help, he feels like his bones have turned to ice. Spiders are cold-blooded.</p>\n<p>When he gets home it\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock and Aunt May\u2019s still in the kitchen and the rain is thundering down on the roof like it\u2019s the end of the world. He holds out the eggs and Aunt May\u2019s arms are around him and she tells him that it\u2019s all right and for one short and shining moment he actually believes her.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sleep that night.</p>\n<p>The next week Peter\u2019s ribs have healed \u2013 thank you, weird mutated healing powers! \u2013 and he\u2019s back in the organic grocery store because the one around the corner from Aunt May\u2019s house shut down unexpectedly a few days ago. Some supervillain turned the place into a giant pumpkin or something, Peter doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like he had the best history with the place anyway. So he and Aunt May are going organic for a while, that\u2019s cool, he went vegan for a little while in middle school when someone told him that if you ate too many cheeseburgers you\u2019d turn into one. He\u2019s not a vegan anymore and, hello, this place isn\u2019t totally vegan either because they have <em>eggs</em> and also <em>dairy products</em> but organic stuff tends to be pretty healthy and he\u2019s totally up for Aunt May eating healthier. Peter has no idea how she\u2019s survived for this long, honestly, that meatloaf of hers is radioactive. He only has one relative left and he intends to keep her.</p>\n<p>By this point he\u2019s mostly convinced himself that the run-in with Captain America was some kind of crazed fever dream or something, so he doesn\u2019t worry about it too much. It\u2019s probably stress. He\u2019s a teenager. Teenagers stress. And yet when he walks in the door the cashier \u2013 blue-haired this time \u2013 is popping bubblegum and Captain America is standing in the frozen foods aisle looking just as distressed as he was last time.</p>\n<p>Peter turns around and immediately starts banging his head against the wall. When he risks a peek Captain America is still there and he\u2019s holding a packet of fish fingers and looking really confused, and also the cashier is giving Peter a weird look. Peter figures he\u2019s losing brain cells and it\u2019s obviously not remedying his psychosis so he stops thumping his head against the wall and saunters not-so-casually over to the frozen foods aisle.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>Cap looks up at him and doesn\u2019t say anything and then he looks back to the fish fingers and he looks like his pet kitten just died. What\u2019s he doing here anyway? Maybe there are supervillains hiding out in the frozen foods aisle. Maybe they\u2019re planning a string of grocery store attacks and they\u2019re planning to turn this place into a giant eggplant or something. Or, you know, maybe he\u2019s just here to do his grocery shopping. Superheroes do grocery shopping, right? Peter\u2019s here so it must be true.</p>\n<p>When Cap finally speaks his voice is hollow and he sounds really, really tragic, like someone just told him Dumbledore dies in the sixth book. Peter almost doesn\u2019t pay attention to what he actually says but what comes out of his mouth is so utterly ridiculous that he can\u2019t help but pay attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cFish don\u2019t have fingers,\u201d says Cap, equal parts baffled and desolate. \u201cIs this a future thing? Do fish have fingers now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just gapes at him because that\u2019s a level of weird that even he can\u2019t handle.</p>\n<p>\u201cFish <em>don\u2019t have fingers</em>,\u201d says Cap again, and there\u2019s a deranged look in his eye. Peter starts to back away slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he tries, \u201cokay, Captain \u2013 um, sir \u2013 um, Sir Captain \u2013 Steve. You\u2019re obviously upset. Just take deep breaths. Fish don\u2019t have fingers. It\u2019s cool, you can calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap obviously listens to him because he closes his eyes and does actually take some deep breaths but then he starts hyperventilating or something and Peter really isn\u2019t sure what to do with a hyperventilating Captain America.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I get it, consumerism is hard,\u201d he says, and starts eyeballing the exit. He hasn\u2019t got his groceries yet but some things just aren\u2019t worth dealing with for fresh fruit and vegetables and a hyperventilating Captain America is one of them. \u201cHey, don\u2019t you live with Tony Stark? Get him to explain it to you. He loves consumerism. He\u2019s like consumerism\u2019s boyfriend. They like to cuddle up on the sofa and consume the souls of the innocent together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d says Captain America and Peter winces. Okay, so that didn\u2019t work. Possibly he should just get out of here and stop confusing the guy, but then Cap pulls out these lost little baby-blue puppy eyes and, all right, Peter\u2019s doomed. Damn him and his Aryan wiles.</p>\n<p>Something strikes him, and he frowns. \u201cWait, if you live in Manhattan what are you doing here? I mean, this place is great and all, but I\u2019m pretty sure Stark can afford to have groceries delivered direct to Avengers Tower, you don\u2019t have to come all the way out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI live in Brooklyn,\u201d says Captain America, looking at Peter like he\u2019s an alien. Well, Cap deals with aliens on a regular basis, so he should know better. \u201cI have an apartment.\u201d All right, so Brooklyn isn\u2019t actually that far away from here. That sort of makes sense. In a world in which Captain America buys his own groceries at an organic health nut supermarket, which doesn\u2019t make sense at all. And it\u2019s not as if Brooklyn doesn\u2019t have its own share of organic markets.</p>\n<p>Peter turns to the freezer and after a cursory glance pulls out a plastic-wrapped sea bass fillet. He shoves it at Cap and says, \u201cHere, you like fish, right? Take that. Grill it or something. Cook it in garlic butter, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Cap\u2019s staring at the fish like it\u2019s an alien. Cap really needs to sort out his alien-detecting abilities, Peter\u2019s fairly certain they\u2019re on the fritz.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cap says, and this lip does this wobbling thing, and suddenly Peter\u2019s terrified that the guy\u2019s about to burst into tears. Peter <em>cannot</em> make Captain America cry. Danger, Will Robinson!</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s just fish,\u201d he says a little desperately. \u201cYou ever need help sorting out grocery catastrophes you just give me a call. It\u2019s, uh. It\u2019s Peter, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you, Peter,\u201d says Captain America at once, like it\u2019s been drilled into him. Maybe it has been drilled into him. He\u2019s meant to be the embodiment of America or whatever, so that would sort of make sense, except that the vast majority of Americans that Peter deals with are assholes. He thinks that\u2019s partly just humans in general, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to meet you too,\u201d Peter says carefully. Good to meet you, <em>Captain America</em>. Seriously, what the hell.</p>\n<p>He gives the guy a tentative pat on the back and then forgets what he was going to say because Cap\u2019s muscles are really... hard. They\u2019re really hard. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Cap\u2019s giving him an odd look and he realises it\u2019s because he\u2019s still touching him. Peter snatches his hand away as if it\u2019s on fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to get my groceries,\u201d he says hastily, only it comes out all one word, one very garbled and incoherent word.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGroceries!\u201d yells Peter and grabs a random packet of something which later proves to be frozen peas, making his escape into the neighbouring aisle. By the time he emerges again, shopping basket full of ridiculously healthy non-meatloaf foodstuffs, Cap has left. The only customer in sight is a doddery old lady with bright, colourful tattoos spiralling over her shoulders and a shopping trolley full of gluten free pancake mix and condoms.</p>\n<p>The old lady presses a packet of condoms into his hand and says, \u201cGo get him, tiger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter seriously considers smothering himself with the peas.</p>\n<p>The next time Peter does a grocery run Captain America isn\u2019t there and he refuses to be disappointed. There are aliens invading New York \u2013 again \u2013 so the guy has better things to do with his time than hover around a tiny organic grocery in Queens looking upset about consumerism and being oblivious to Peter staring at his ass.</p>\n<p>Peter could be helping with that whole aliens thing, but, well. Manhattan\u2019s already been evacuated so there aren\u2019t any civilians for him to help out, and there\u2019s a giant spaceship hovering in the sky threatening to wipe out the Earth. This is big-fry stuff. Peter is very much a small-fry kind of superhero. What\u2019s he going to do, chuck webbing at the spaceship? It\u2019s made of vibranium and the whole thing\u2019s deadlock sealed, the worst he\u2019s going to do is smear the paintwork. It\u2019d be like a kid sticking chewing gum to someone\u2019s Harley Davidson. No, this is diplomacy stuff. He\u2019ll leave it to SHIELD and the Avengers.</p>\n<p>It probably says something about New York that nobody\u2019s freaked out much by the giant spaceship. The worst reaction even from the guys evacuated from Manhattan is grumbling about how it\u2019s a Saturday, and couldn\u2019t the aliens at least schedule this sort of crap for a weekday? But it\u2019s New York \u2013 they might as well be sitting on top of a Hellmouth for all the weird shit that comes their way. Last week it was zombies, this week it\u2019s aliens. It happens.</p>\n<p>Peter loads up on fresh spinach and feta and garlic cloves, and resolves not to think too much about it. If he thinks about it he\u2019ll only worry about it, and worrying about Captain America facing off against a spaceship half the size of the city armed only with a <em>shield</em> is just a recipe for disaster. Instead he\u2019s going to make quiche. Quiche is awesome. And he\u2019s discovered that the best way to avoid his aunt\u2019s potentially fatal cooking is just to do all the cooking himself, which tends to work out better for everyone. Everyone being him and Aunt May. Who are not dying from meatloaf poisoning. That thing about his weakness being small knives? Yeah, no. His weakness is terrible meatloaf.</p>\n<p>So he goes home and he cooks the quiche and watches the news. The news says that the aliens have been defeated and everyone can go back to Manhattan now. Tony Stark does a little speech about how aliens are just misunderstood and how people should just be super nice to them because they can\u2019t help being confused genocidal maniacs. Peter puts the quiche in the fridge for later and goes out to the laundromat. Usually they do their laundry at home but the washing machine\u2019s stuffed up and he suspects it\u2019s because he put his Spiderman suit in a hot wash with webbing all over it and the webbing kind of melted everywhere. He\u2019s hoping that Aunt May won\u2019t notice until after he fixes it, and until then it\u2019s laundromat adventure time.</p>\n<p>And because the universe hates him Captain America is at his laundromat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>don\u2019t even live here</em>,\u201d says Peter in despair.</p>\n<p>Cap looks up and his face seriously brightens all over, like he\u2019s got megawatt bulbs implanted under his skin. Peter knows how ridiculous this comparison is and he\u2019s sticking to it because that smile is <em>blinding</em>. \u201cOh, hi Peter!\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cDo you know how to work a washing machine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Peter. \u201cYes I do. What are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWashing... my clothes,\u201d says Cap slowly. He peers at Peter worriedly, like he\u2019s concerned he has a head injury or something. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have these things back in my day and Tony just gets his robots to do his housework for him. I tried to use the Google but it wasn\u2019t very helpful. Where do I put the coin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the coin slot,\u201d says Peter. \u201cWhy are you washing your own clothes? You\u2019re Captain America. Don\u2019t you have minions to do that for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Captain America gets a funny look on his face, like he\u2019s just eaten a lemon doused in chilli powder. \u201cThey\u2019re my clothes,\u201d he says stubbornly. \u201cI got them dirty so I\u2019m getting them clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d says Peter, and then he swallows, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re my clothes,\u201d says Cap again, somewhat plaintively. \u201cWhen I wouldn\u2019t let the robots touch them Tony kept just buying me new ones. I don\u2019t need new clothes. I like these ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Peter, and he lets out a long breath. \u201cOkay. Give me your clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap hands over his basket and it\u2019s full of old-timey plaid shirts and also his Captain America suit. Peter is touching Captain America\u2019s Captain America suit. He\u2019s distracted from the awesomeness of the moment by the fact that the suit is covered in these weird brownish stains, and it takes him a moment to realise what the stains are and then he just can\u2019t process it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this <em>blood</em>?\u201d he asks in horror, and Cap takes the basket away again because Peter\u2019s hands are shaking so badly he\u2019s about to drop it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d says Cap quickly. He winces. \u201cWell, most of it\u2019s not mine. But look, super-healing, see?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Peter\u2019s brain shuts down because Captain America is <em>pulling off his shirt</em> to show him that he\u2019s okay and he\u2019s revealing this huge expanse of perfect, golden skin, and Captain America has freckles on his shoulders. Peter lets out a strangled moan and then flushes brilliantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, \u201cright, okay, you\u2019re fine, you\u2019re good, please put your shirt back on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap puts his shirt back on and he doesn\u2019t look fazed in the slightest and everyone else in the laundromat looks kind of shell-shocked, like Elvis or Jesus or Marilyn Monroe just walked in the door and started stripping off their clothes.</p>\n<p>He shows Cap how to use the washing machines, and then he does his own, being very careful to hide his Iron Man underwear so that Cap doesn\u2019t see it. They sit next to each other on seats with such hard backs that even Peter can\u2019t get comfortable, despite his mutated spider flexibility. Cap seems strangely fascinated with watching his clothes whirl around and around in the machine, and he keeps getting up to press his fingers against the glass to feel the warmth of the water inside. Spaceships, robot suits, these things the guy can handle \u2013 but washing machines? <em>Washing machines</em> are what fascinate him?</p>\n<p>Peter will never understand this guy.</p>\n<p>They make a small amount of very stilted conversation while they\u2019re waiting, but mostly Cap seems content to just sit there in silence and enjoy the really awkward moment. When their washing\u2019s done Peter shows the guy how to use the dryer, and Cap\u2019s so thrilled by it that Peter\u2019s kind of worried he\u2019s going to try and crawl inside it or something. When his clothes are dry Cap holds them all up to his face and inhales deeply like he\u2019s trying to breathe in all the warmth. Peter does not find it cute. He doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe a little bit.</p>\n<p>Okay, a lot.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he\u2019s in trouble.</p>\n<p>The next time Peter meets Captain America is because supervillains are attacking their grocery store.</p>\n<p>Yeah, Peter\u2019s not impressed either.</p>\n<p>There are two of them and they\u2019re wearing lab coats and hefting enormous freeze rays. So far about half the store is frozen. Peter isn\u2019t sure exactly what they\u2019re trying to achieve \u2013 they haven\u2019t made it to the till yet and there\u2019s probably not even enough money in the till to justify this amount of effort. If you\u2019re going to go to all the trouble of making a freeze ray why the hell would you then target an organic grocery rather than a bank? What are they going to steal, ethically grown cabbage? If Peter was a supervillain \u2013 not that he\u2019s thinking of becoming one \u2013 he\u2019d be a damn sight better at it than these idiots. Also he\u2019d start with an IHOP maybe rather than a grocery store. Because pancakes are awesome.</p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, so maybe Peter wouldn\u2019t make a great villain after all.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re small-fry villains, the way Peter\u2019s a small-fry hero, and usually he\u2019d have no problems dealing with this. He\u2019s already wearing his suit under his shirt, so all he\u2019d have to do is just duck around the corner, take all his clothes off really quickly and stick his mask on and then he\u2019d have the villains stuck to the wall in like five seconds flat. Except that Captain America\u2019s here, and even though he doesn\u2019t have his shield with him he\u2019s still perfectly capable of making a nuisance of himself where villains are concerned. But Cap doesn\u2019t seem to want to take them out, despite the fact that if he angled his spinning roundhouse kicks an inch to the left he\u2019d have knocked both of them unconscious by now.</p>\n<p>The problem here is that Cap\u2019s a bleeding heart. Instead of knocking the villains out and calling the cops, he\u2019s determined to talk them down, let them redeem themselves. And of course that isn\u2019t happening any time soon.</p>\n<p>He keeps trying to plead with the villains. \u201cYou could benefit society in a productive manner! You could donate to charities and contribute your science to peacekeeping relief organisations!\u201d They\u2019re not really listening to him.</p>\n<p>The other problem with Captain America being here is that Peter is now in real danger of revealing his secret identity. Or, well, in revealing his not-so-secret identity, since technically Peter Parker is his secret identity and Cap already knows that one. Peter helps out where he can \u2013 unobtrusive web-shots tipping over a strategically-placed shelf, or stuck to one of the villain\u2019s shoes so that he trips himself up; he resists the urge to aim his webs at the villains\u2019 groins \u2013 but Cap has sharp eyes and the risk of him noticing is becoming more and more of an issue. Peter kind of wishes the guy would stop babbling and just take the villains out already, but that\u2019s not really Cap\u2019s style, at least when it comes to regular old New Yorkers and not, like, aliens or demons or zombies or whatever.</p>\n<p>(The other other problem: Peter can\u2019t help but flashback to the last time he was witness to a grocery store robbery. It\u2019s not helping.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about your choices!\u201d shouts Cap, while kicking one of the villains in the head. \u201cYou have a brain!\u201d No kidding. \u201cYou could put yourself through university!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been to university!\u201d bellows one of the villains, aiming her freeze ray at Cap and shooting. The shot misses completely and hits a pyramid of satsumas. The satsumas immediately form a satsuma avalanche and tumble in every direction possible, some of them smashing into little frozen splinters when they hit the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d asks Cap. Cap thinks that he\u2019s subtle. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStanf \u2013\u201d she starts, before her companion interrupts her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my gosh, Gracie, <em>shut up</em>,\u201d he yells. \u201cDo you want him to know everything about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Doctor Freeze!\u201d she shouts back, completely ignoring Cap in favour of bitching out her co-villain. Doctor Freeze is a really weak supervillain name. \u201cDoctor Cold, you did not just use my real name in front of <em>Captain America</em> \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, so Doctor Cold is even worse. Doesn\u2019t exactly evoke images of terrifying supervillainous antics. More like it evokes images of a malfunctioning refrigerator.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even a doctor!\u201d he shrieks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have half a PhD in biochemistry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we interrupting something?\u201d asks Peter, nonplussed.</p>\n<p>At that the villains both whirl around to face him, and Peter gets a sinking feeling in his stomach which is completely validated when three seconds later there are two huge jets of ice shooting towards him.</p>\n<p>He slings a rope of web at the ceiling and pulls himself up and out of danger, the freeze rays harmlessly hitting the wall behind him. In the space where he used to be there is now a huge icy crater. A second later Captain America takes out both of the villains with <em>one punch</em>, which should not even be possible, but he\u2019s Captain fucking America so there you go.</p>\n<p>Cap takes a faltering step towards the icy crater. There\u2019s a horrible, twisted look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Peter from the ceiling, and Cap is so surprised that he actually trips and falls on his ass. Which is a shame. Because it\u2019s a really nice ass.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d he says in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re on the ceiling,\u201d says Cap.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Peter. \u201cYes I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a brief and horrifically awkward pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can explain?\u201d he offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease come down from the ceiling,\u201d says Captain America.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Peter, and comes down from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other for a moment. It\u2019s kind of an awkward moment. Peter has a habit of creating awkward moments wherever he goes, so this isn\u2019t exactly new for him. He\u2019s like the Santa Claus of awkward. Always giving.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh,\u201d he says, and then decides to just get it over with, \u201cI\u2019m Spiderman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d says Cap, and Peter braces himself for censure, \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d says Cap. \u201cI support your life choices. You\u2019re a productive member of society. Well done. Gold star.\u201d</p>\n<p>Captain America just gave him a metaphorical gold star. Peter can\u2019t decide whether to be absurdly pleased or really, really confused. He goes with both.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to arrest me?\u201d he says uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d says Cap. \u201cDid you forget the part where I\u2019m a superhero too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell on me to SHIELD?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not that either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to tap me for recruitment?\u201d Peter\u2019s starting to feel a little unloved here.</p>\n<p>Cap sighs. \u201cLook, Pete. You\u2019re doing what you think is right, and I support that. I know Spiderman gets a lot of bad press but SHIELD keeps track of these things and if we actually thought you were a problem you\u2019d be in custody by now. I\u2019d love to have you on the team but I hope you understand why I can\u2019t ask you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m too young,\u201d says Peter. His face screws up a bit and he looks down at his feet, so that he can avoid those baby-bird eyes. Cap\u2019s whole face is practically cheeping at him in distress. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, you know. I graduate in two months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, well,\u201d he swallows, \u201cif we\u2019re talking inexperience here, I mean, you didn\u2019t even live through the nineties. You didn\u2019t even live through the \u2013 whatever we\u2019re calling the decade that came after the nineties. You\u2019re practically a toddler. I bet you don\u2019t even know how to play Pacman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re inexperienced,\u201d says Cap. He gently presses his fingers to Peter\u2019s chin and lifts his gaze up so that they\u2019re eye to eye. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019ve got a secret identity. The Avengers are put in the public eye a lot. Part of that\u2019s Tony\u2019s fault, but part of it\u2019s just a job hazard. I couldn\u2019t promise you that we\u2019d be able to keep your identity under wraps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Peter, feeling like all the breath has been sucked out of his chest. \u201cWell, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s fair enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap smiles brilliantly at him. \u201cWant to help me take these two miscreants down to the local precinct?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d says Peter, feeling a little wrong-footed, \u201cI usually just stick them to a wall and leave before the cops get here. After Captain Stacey... the police aren\u2019t exactly fond of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll vouch for you,\u201d says Cap, shrugging. \u201cThe police are plenty fond of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d says Peter under his breath, and then blushes horribly when Cap raises his eyebrows. Fuck, he keeps forgetting about the super-everything. He should have figured super-hearing would be part of the package. Cap is a ridiculous specimen of humanity. \u201cNo, really, don\u2019t worry about it. I have to go anyway, I have to pick up my au... my... uh... my ant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap stares. \u201cYour ant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Peter. Fuck. Fuckety fuck fuckfuck. \u201cFuck. I mean, no! I mean, yes, my ant. My ant... farm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to go pick up your ant farm,\u201d says Captain America, and, okay, now Peter knows the guy is just laughing at him on the inside because his eyes are crinkling up in this adorable way and his lips... hmm. His lips. Peter\u2019s lost his train of thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d says Peter. He\u2019s dug himself this deep, he figures now he\u2019s just got to own the awkward. And he guesses he\u2019s proving Cap\u2019s point \u2013 this is exactly what the guy meant about secret identities being hard to keep. This would be so much easier if Aunt May was a superhero too. \u201cIt\u2019s at the vet\u2019s. I have to pick up my ant farm from the vet\u2019s because they\u2019re... ill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Cap, biting at his lip in poorly concealed amusement. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a guy I could introduce you to that you might get along with. He likes ants too. You know Hank Pym?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u201d says Peter, completely forgetting his outlandish lie in his excitement. \u201cThe guy who discovered the Pym particle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d says Cap. \u201cSwing by the Tower sometime, I\u2019ll give you his number.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s brain goes a little fuzzy. Cap just invited him to the Avengers Tower. To give him Hank Pym\u2019s phone number. Motherhugger, that is just way too much awesome for his mind to process right now.</p>\n<p>Never mind that he\u2019d never be able to actually call the guy \u2013 that shit\u2019s traceable. But it\u2019s the thought that counts. And the thought is pretty damn sweet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says belatedly. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to... do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap pulls a business card out of \u2013 actually, Peter doesn\u2019t want to know where he pulled it out of; his suit isn\u2019t exactly covered in handy pockets \u2013 somewhere, anyway, he pulls it out of somewhere, and presses it into Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cCall me any time you need something,\u201d he says, and then hesitates. \u201cEven if you just need to chat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares down at the card. Captain America just gave him his phone number. <em>Captain America </em>just gave <em>Peter</em> his <em>phone number</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so overwhelmed by the ridiculousness of this moment that he completely fails to notice when Cap hefts both of the villains over one shoulder and leaves the store, jauntily singing <em>Hitler Has Only Got One Ball</em> under his breath.</p>\n<p>Peter sinks to the floor in a daze, and will only later realise that he has sat in a puddle left over from the melting freeze rays.</p>\n<p>Peter had never really intended to follow up on the offer to swing by the Avengers Tower. He figures that he gets enough bad press as it is, and he doesn\u2019t need the increase in attention that being publicly linked to the Avengers would get him. Now, though, it seems like he doesn\u2019t really have a choice.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a new supervillain on the block, and he\u2019s calling himself Doctor Octopus \u2013 seriously, what is it with supervillain names starting with \u2018Doctor\u2019? They\u2019re <em>not even doctors</em> \u2013 and Peter managed to provoke him into a bit of a tussle today. Well, if \u2018a bit of a tussle\u2019 amounts to three possibly-broken ribs and one definitely-broken arm. The arm maybe counts as more than one because he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s broken in lots of different places. Doc Ock was pretty creative.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point is, he needs medical attention, and he can\u2019t get it at an ordinary hospital. Even if he could afford the medical bills, he can\u2019t afford the questions it would raise. He\u2019s still in his suit, and his dominant arm\u2019s twisted at such an unnatural angle that he\u2019s going to have to be cut out of it, and he can\u2019t reach it himself. In the eyes of the public, at best he\u2019s an illegal vigilante and at worst he\u2019s a supervillain in his own right. He doesn\u2019t want to risk having the cops called on him before he can even get himself fixed up.</p>\n<p>Which leaves him with one option, and that\u2019s reaching out to Captain America.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s not sure how the other Avengers would respond to him rocking up at their base and begging for painkillers, but hopefully he\u2019ll be able to get in and out before they even notice him. Failing that, Cap\u2019s word has got to be worth something. It\u2019s not the end of the world if this doesn\u2019t work out. He\u2019s pretty sure that he could Google \u201chow to set a broken arm\u201d and not actually kill himself, and after that hopefully the super-healing would kick in. Broken bones only take a few hours to heal up, usually. The problem is setting it \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t set the bone correctly then it won\u2019t heal correctly, and if he\u2019s left with his arm sticking out at a weird angle like this then he\u2019s pretty much screwed.</p>\n<p>Which leads him to where he is now: hanging around awkwardly on the roof of the Avengers Tower, cellphone in his left hand and Captain America\u2019s business card clutched between his toes, weighing up his options.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s past the point where he\u2019s worried about anyone tracing his cell. If he\u2019s going to do this then he\u2019s going to have to trust these guys. And if he can\u2019t trust Captain fucking America then who can he trust?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little creepy that Peter\u2019s standing exactly where Loki\u2019s gigantic tesseract-powered portal-to-another-realm used to be, but at least there\u2019s a trapdoor, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to just drop straight into Tony Stark\u2019s penthouse. How else is he supposed to get access to the top-secret Avengers Tower? He\u2019s surprised they haven\u2019t booby-trapped the roof by now.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and dials the number. It rings twice and then Cap picks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Cap, it\u2019s me,\u201d says Peter raggedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d says Cap, sounding surprised. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich roof?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour roof. The Tower\u2019s roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a second pause, longer than the first.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right up,\u201d says Cap at last. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap hangs up and Peter fumbles his cell into a pocket of his backpack.</p>\n<p>After a few agonising minutes there\u2019s a clattering of footsteps and the trapdoor opens to reveal Cap wearing his best concerned-citizen expression. The concern only intensifies when he notices the gross-looking angle of Peter\u2019s broken arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Pete,\u201d he sighs, reaching out a hand and stopping just short of actually touching his arm, fluttering his fingers about an inch over the point where a bone\u2019s poking through the skin. Bones really shouldn\u2019t do that. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d says Peter, trying to be flippant and failing utterly. \u201cSame old. Supervillain old, that is, I didn\u2019t mean you, not that you\u2019re <em>old</em>, ninety-five isn\u2019t old, and you haven\u2019t aged physically or mentally past your twenties yet \u2013 ugh, I mean, it was Doctor Octopus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe a new guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. Just started today,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI was lucky enough to be his superhero welcoming party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky,\u201d repeats the Captain, sounding sad.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs, and then regrets it when the movement sends pain screaming up his arm. \u201cHey, so, I was wondering if you\u2019d maybe know how to set this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have first aid training,\u201d says Cap, \u201cbut I can do you one better. What do you say to letting Bruce fix you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce?\u201d repeats Peter, then, \u201cBruce <em>Banner</em>?\u201d He swoons a little, then, but it\u2019s definitely from pain and not from geeky joy. Definitely. \u201cAre you sure he wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, he won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d says Peter. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s not too busy, you know, making intense scientific breakthroughs in the field of gamma radiation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d says Cap, smiling a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t want to interrupt that,\u201d he presses. \u201cThis can wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t wait, you self-sacrificing dummy,\u201d says Cap, rolling his eyes a little. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you to the medical bay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Peter agreeably, and lets Cap help him through the trapdoor.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it\u2019s not as if Banner can\u2019t set his arm and make scientific breakthroughs at the same time. Right? Right.</p>\n<p>Bruce Banner has access to the <em>good</em> drugs. That is, the drugs that work as painkillers and local anaesthetics even on metahuman physiologies, which is nice, considering that even morphine only serves to give Peter the faintest of very faint buzzes.</p>\n<p>This may lead to him making some slightly embarrassing confessions directed at Cap while Banner wraps his ribs and sets his arm, but he\u2019s high, he can\u2019t help it. And Cap\u2019s a gigantic Boy Scout, he won\u2019t hold it against him. Probably. Even if Tony Stark\u2019s smartass AI keeps pointing out that all of this is being recorded on the surveillance tapes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCap, your eyes are really, really... blue,\u201d says Peter earnestly, swinging his head around so that he can stare at Cap\u2019s eyes properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, Pete,\u201d says Cap, and bless the guy, he\u2019s not even smirking at him, he just looks kind of worried. Banner, on the other hand, is biting down hard on his fist to prevent himself from laughing. Or possibly from Hulking out. One of the two.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d says Peter. It\u2019s very important that Cap listens to him. Very, very... important. \u201cYour eyes are like. They\u2019re like blue M&amp;Ms. Blue M&amp;Ms are the best kind and your eyes are the best kind. It\u2019s <em>scientific</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Banner makes a really undignified noise and has to go in the other room. Peter stares after him for a moment and hopes that he\u2019s not Hulking out, but then he hears muffled peals of laughter and, okay, he\u2019s not Hulking out, he\u2019s just having a gigglefit. It\u2019s all good.</p>\n<p>Anyway, his arm\u2019s all fixed up now, and he\u2019s got a shiny purple sling to prove it. Banner didn\u2019t put a plaster cast on it because it\u2019s going to be healed by tomorrow, but he strapped it up nicely and Peter swears he can already feel the bones knitting back together. The sling kind of clashes with his suit \u2013 Banner had cut away the sleeve and some of the torso but Peter had refused to remove the rest of it in order to preserve his secret identity. Preserving his secret identity would be a lot easier if Cap would stop calling him by his first name. Maybe Peter should change his superhero name to Peter Parker so that Cap can call him Pete without raising suspicion. No one would suspect a thing!</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, swinging his legs off the gurney, \u201cI\u2019ll just be going now,\u201d and then he hits a snag. The snag being that he sways dizzily and almost falls over but for Cap managing to catch him in time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa there, soldier,\u201d says Cap, steadying him with one arm looped under his armpits. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere in this state. You can wait here until your bones heal up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter isn\u2019t listening to what Cap\u2019s saying. He\u2019s too distracted by the highly muscled upper arm in his face. Mmm.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d says Cap. \u201cAre you getting this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blows a raspberry against Captain America\u2019s arm and giggles because his mask gets in the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cOookay,\u201d says Cap, and hoists Peter to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go upstairs and watch some movies. How does that sound?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter mumbles something unintelligible and then possibly blacks out for the next ten minutes. When he surfaces he\u2019s propped up on a couch and there\u2019s a long, warm body beside him. He turns his head to the side and, okay, he\u2019s cuddling on the couch with Captain America. That\u2019s fine. Yup. Happens all the time. ...In his fantasies. But hey, he\u2019s probably hallucinating, so he won\u2019t worry about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating,\u201d says Cap, and oh, shit, did he say that out loud?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you said it out loud,\u201d says Cap, and grins a bit. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind not getting to pick the movie, I\u2019m still working my way through the twentieth century. We\u2019re up to the seventies. Tony\u2019s educating me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns his head to the left and realises that Tony Stark is sitting on the adjoining couch. And Bruce just came back into the room and is sprawled out on this fabulously luxurious chaise longue and possibly purring a little bit. And Hawkeye is perched on the arm of the couch that Black Widow\u2019s sitting on and the Norse God of Thunder is sitting opposite them wearing a <em>bathrobe</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he manages, and burrows back into Cap\u2019s side, because Cap\u2019s warm and cuddly and his brain can only handle so much at once.</p>\n<p>Cap puts his arm around him and maybe blushes a bit.</p>\n<p>Tony Stark raises his eyebrows and, because he\u2019s a complete bastard, puts on <em>Harold and Maude</em>.</p>\n<p>Peter puts up a token protest at first, because, really, putting on a classic May-December romance film is a little inappropriate. Cap might be a senior citizen but he\u2019s not a <em>senior </em>citizen and anyway Peter doesn\u2019t even have a crush, nope, not at all. And then the movie really starts and he gets so engrossed that he shuts up entirely. Black Widow keeps letting out these little snorts at the deadpan one-liners and Thor keeps responding to the film in this booming voice that practically shakes the whole house \u2013 \u201cI, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO BE A SUNFLOWER, TONY STARK!\u201d and Tony\u2019s like \u201cMe too, Thor, now shut the hell up\u201d \u2013 and Bruce gets another fit of the giggles at the part with the psychiatrist. And then by the end of the film they\u2019re all <em>sobbing helplessly</em> and Thor\u2019s brokenly singing along to the end credits and he\u2019s completely out of tune, possibly because of the big, fat, Norse god tears rolling down his face.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s not quite sure how much of this is the drugs and how much of it is just the whacked-out farce that his life has become, but he gets to cuddle into Captain America\u2019s abs, so, whatever.</p>\n<p>Tony puts on <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> next because he\u2019s a sadistic, disturbed creature and Cap\u2019s face when John Cleese starts mocking everyone in an outrageous French accent is just too priceless. In fact, it\u2019s so priceless that Tony takes a photo of it and puts it on the Internet. Of course Tony mouths along with every line, which surprises no one, but then when Dennis the Constitutional Peasant pops up and Hawkeye suddenly shrieks out \u201cHelp, help, I\u2019m being repressed!\u201d half a second before Michael Palin says it, even Tony looks shocked. (Tony gets over it quickly, and offers Hawkeye a fistbump, which he returns.)</p>\n<p>And then they watch <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> and every single Avenger gets up and does the Time Warp, and after that Black Widow and Hawkeye start debating the relative merits of fishnets vs. sheer nylons, and Peter <em>knows </em>he\u2019s not hallucinating now because this shit is just too crazy to make up. Cap seems surprisingly unfazed by all the transvestism and Tony decides that he\u2019s going to create his own gold-hotpants-wearing mechanised version of Rocky and they all have to sit on him to stop him from running down to the lab.</p>\n<p>And then they watch <em>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</em> and Peter falls asleep on Cap\u2019s shoulder partway through, right after Han shoots first.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up everyone\u2019s gone except for Cap and the lights are dimmed and the <em>Star Wars</em> credits are playing on mute. Cap\u2019s snoring like a freight train and his arm is still tucked around him. Peter yawns and snuggles closer and goes back to sleep.</p>\n<p>After that everything sort of degenerates into this sneaky spiral of insanity where Cap keeps popping up in random places <em>all the time</em>. It\u2019s not just the organic grocery and the laundromat anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the bank and the pharmacy and the library and Peter\u2019s kind of wondering if maybe Cap snuck a GPS tracker onto him at some point. If it was anyone else he might start to be worried for his virtue, but honestly, when it\u2019s Captain America stalking you it\u2019s just not scary at all. It\u2019s like being stalked by a kitten. He\u2019s just too sweet and fluffy and Peter just wants to pet him.</p>\n<p>Most of the time Cap manages to drag him back to Avengers Tower, which is half <em>really awesome</em>,<em> </em>because Bruce and Tony let him hang out in the lab with them, and half <em>really traumatising</em>, because he keeps accidentally walking in on Tony and Pepper having sex all over the damn place. Peter\u2019s pretty sure the Rolls Royce hood wasn\u2019t built to take that much weight (not when Tony\u2019s in the Iron Man suit, anyway), and that time with the kitchen counter was just unsanitary. Seriously, would it be so hard to stick a note on the door? Or to get JARVIS to shoo off unwary intruders?</p>\n<p>And, yeah, so much for Captain America having his own apartment. Peter\u2019s pretty sure Cap only stays there when he\u2019s been out late from stalking too much. He\u2019s got a whole floor to himself in the Tower, which includes a really comfortable couch that he lets Peter crash on occasionally.</p>\n<p>Peter still keeps his mask on at the Tower, because even if Cap already knows everything there is to know, and Tony probably already knows his shoe size and his address and his favourite kind of toothpaste, he\u2019s going to make every effort to keep his identity a secret from the others for as long as possible. He knows <em>exactly</em> how insane these guys are, and he doesn\u2019t want to expose Aunt May to this kind of madness. Doesn\u2019t stop him from getting kind of reluctantly fond of them, though mostly that\u2019s Hawkeye\u2019s fault. Hawkeye and Peter have a bromance. This bromance is mostly rooted in a shared love of perching in high places and then jumping out and scaring the crap out of people.</p>\n<p>And if Peter occasionally finds himself stalking Cap in return... well, can you blame him? Cap\u2019s just a big hunk of gorgeous, and there\u2019s no way the guy can take care of himself, he doesn\u2019t even know what a credit card is. He still calls Google \u201cthe Google\u201d, for fuck\u2019s sake \u2013 Peter\u2019s half convinced that Cap still thinks there\u2019s a tiny JARVIS inside his computer answering all his questions for him. At least he managed to figure out Wikipedia. That solved a lot of issues, but it raised a couple more. Nobody had actually told Cap about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and then when he read about the Khmer Rouge and the Rwandan Genocide he went to his room and cried for a while. Peter didn\u2019t say anything, he just sat there rubbing circles onto Captain America\u2019s back and trying not to be too ashamed of his species.</p>\n<p>Most of Peter\u2019s family is dead, and everyone that Cap ever knew is dead. They both have baggage. But their baggage is complementary, and they manage to help each other through their grief in small ways, like when Cap hijacks the kitchen and makes <em>the biggest sandwich in the world</em> and then gives it to Peter, and when Peter manages to teach Thor the hammer dance and then makes him put on an impromptu concert for Cap. (Actually, that one ends kind of badly \u2013 Thor puts Mjolnir through the wall and Tony isn\u2019t very impressed.)</p>\n<p>And then one day they\u2019re cuddled up in the rec room watching <em>The Princess Bride</em>, and Cap\u2019s breathing soft little puffs of air onto Peter\u2019s neck, and Peter tips up his head and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Steve is so shocked he actually <em>falls off the couch</em> and, okay, it\u2019s not Peter\u2019s best moment, because Peter\u2019s so shocked at Steve being shocked that he flails around a bit and manages to elbow him in the face. Steve\u2019s nose makes this ominous crunching sound and Peter can\u2019t stop apologising and then Steve wraps his arms around him and mashes their lips together. He keeps letting out these little hitching whimpers, which Peter suspects is because he just broke his nose and his nose is currently flattened against Peter\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>The next week there are aliens invading New York again, so they\u2019re a bit distracted, but the week after that the supervillains quiet down again and Peter decides that it\u2019s time to get back at Tony and Pepper for traumatising him for life. He and Steve fuck on pretty much every horizontal surface in the Tower, and then most of the vertical surfaces, and then some of the in-between surfaces, including the anti-gravity chamber that Tony installed a couple of months ago. It\u2019s a little bit awkward and a little bit hilarious and also the hottest thing Peter\u2019s ever done in his life. Tony won\u2019t stop complaining about not being able to get the stains out, but Peter\u2019s pretty sure he secretly thinks the whole thing is hysterical. Tony is a bad influence.</p>\n<p>After a while Peter starts leaving his mask off when he\u2019s at the Tower, because he loves the suit but spandex just doesn\u2019t breathe very well. Eventually the press catches on, but by that point Tony\u2019s got them all brainwashed to love him, and of course everyone loves Steve more than they love hamburgers, and as it turns out some of that love extends to Peter.</p>\n<p>Two years later Steve asks Peter to marry him, and Peter\u2019s so excited he accidentally punches him in the eye.</p>\n<p>It pretty much goes uphill from there.</p>"
