  "text": "<p>The second time Lan Zhan said <em> Wei Ying, come back, </em>Wei Wuxian did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t escape him that this time, too, he was standing at the edge of a cliff, open air behind him and Chenqing in his hand. But otherwise things couldn\u2019t have been more different. Back then, the world had been black and boiling and smelling of smoke, sulfur, hot blood and the oily fecal stench of split intestines, corpse-rot rising up from far below. Death in every breath. Now it was all green. The world smelled of wildflowers, mountain grass, a coming rain. It smelled like soil, wet and dark enough to grow something.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wei Ying. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turned around. And there he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stared at each other for so long Wei Wuxian almost laughed, if only to break the silence. Ten months. It had been ten months.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looked the same, except Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t seen him in ten months, and it was like stumbling through a dark forest only to find a shining river; he couldn\u2019t not drink deeply. The reality of Lan Zhan, here and solid and bright. Here, with all the details that didn\u2019t show up in dreams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou found me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d said Lan Zhan, and Wei Wuxian closed his eyes. Nobody said his name like that. Nobody had ever said his name like that, not even shijie. In Lan Zhan\u2019s voice, his name was a piece of glass washed up on the lakeshore, soft around the edges from all those years of water. It was like that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ten months. Ten months. Wei Wuxian knew he\u2019d miss him, but god damn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian opened his eyes and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took the rest of the afternoon to coax Little Apple down one mountain and up another, into the cool mists of the Cloud Recesses. Wei Wuxian spent that time regaling Lan Zhan with everything he\u2019d done over the past ten months: the towns and villages he passed through, the countless night hunts, the hauntings, the monsters, the nasty little foxglove-imps in Tianbeiwan, the woman in Shangfeng who begged him to stay for dinner because he played the dizi like her dead son. The dead son, a flicker of silvery blue light in the corner of the room. <em> He was easy, </em> Wei Wuxian told Lan Zhan. <em> Just wanted to play one last song for his ma. Still, I kept wishing you were\u2014I kept wishing I knew Inquiry. </em> He told Lan Zhan about riding west, his back to the rising sun. The village terrorized by an imitation Xiangliu that turned out not to be a nine-headed snake monster at all, just a regular old grass snake with an illusion sigil burned into its white belly, a young cultivator\u2019s prank gone wrong. Meihua Village, a cluster of houses on an island in the middle of a wide river, so named because the island had more plum trees than people. <em> Lan Zhan, I thought I was seeing things at first. The whole island was bright pink.\u00a0 </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you really shouldn\u2019t let me talk so much,\u201d he said as they crossed a shallow creek. Lan Zhan was stepping delicately from stone to stone; Wei Wuxian had chosen to wade barefoot alongside his horrible idiot donkey. The last rays of the setting sun cut through the mist, turning everything around them a fine, hazy gold. \u201cIt\u2019s been months since I talked to someone who actually listens. I\u2019ll talk all night if you\u2019re not careful. I\u2019ll never shut up again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan reached the other side and turned around, his gaze warm and steady.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Nobody looks at me like you do</em>, Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead he said, \u201cLan Zhan\u2014,\u201d and then Little Apple slipped on a rock and nearly took him down with her. By the time he\u2019d managed to regain his footing on the slippery creek bottom, clinging to Little Apple\u2019s bridle for dear life, he was already laughing. His voice rang through the trees, loud enough to startle a few birds into taking off overhead, a flutter of wingbeats and rustling leaves. Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes were soaked to the thigh with icy mountain runoff. He shivered, still laughing, and looked up to find Lan Zhan watching him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face was doing the soft thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a semi-recent development. Wei Wuxian remembered seeing the soft thing maybe three or four times in his past life, the most recent time being that perfect sunlit afternoon in Yiling before they\u2019d sprinted back to the Burial Mounds. Before Lan Zhan had left for Gusu; before Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind had gone belly-up and blank-eyed; before all good things hit the ground and shattered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, no. Not everything that had hit the ground was good, and not everything good was lost. The proof stood before Wei Wuxian right now on the bank of a shallow creek. The proof glowed even in the fading sun. Hanguang-jun, light-bearer. There was no one more worthy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, the soft thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over those first few months after Wei Wuxian had come back from the dead, he\u2019d seen it more and more: Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes going all dark and gentle, his mouth curving into the faintest smile. It was devastating every single time. Wei Wuxian had no idea what to do with a smile like that, never mind one directed at him. It felt like the only appropriate reaction would be to curl up in a ball or shriek at the top of his lungs or climb a tree just to leap out of it. The only reason he hadn\u2019t died again within a week of being resurrected was because he no longer had a golden core, and therefore could not physically go into qi deviation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t smiling as Wei Wuxian dragged Little Apple out of the creek and back up onto the mountain path, but there was a warmth to his face. If Jiang Cheng was the flash of a saltpeter bomb and shijie a lantern lighting the way home, Lan Zhan was\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan was\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, did you miss me?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to imagine how boring it is in the Cloud Recesses when I\u2019m not around to stir up trouble. No, I\u2019m kidding, I bet you liked the peace and quiet. Do you have to take a lot of meetings? How much paperwork does the Chief Cultivator do in a day? Aiyah, poor Lan Zhan, what a nightmare. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m back. I\u2019ll let you work for... seven hours a day. Not a minute more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ran back through everything he said. \u201cYou liked the peace and quiet? Well, of course. Why do you think I waited ten months to come back?\u201d He swatted at Little Apple\u2019s flank, urging her along. They\u2019d reached the main path that led up to the white gates of the Cloud Recesses, and Wei Wuxian was impatient to get there all of a sudden, terrible food and four thousand rules be damned. \u201cTo tell you the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cI was planning to keep traveling through winter, at least through the solstice, but....\u201d He remembered just in time that he absolutely should <em> not </em> mention the poisonfeather birds, Lan Zhan would just worry for nothing. \u201cAh, it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just say ten months was enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI received your letters,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014?\u201d Wei Wuxian panicked for a second before remembering he had, in fact, sent some of the letters he wrote. \u201cRight, right. Sorry about my handwriting, I tried to write neatly but it took so <em> long </em> and I figured, it\u2019s fine, Lan Zhan will know what I\u2019m saying. My calligraphy never held a candle to yours, anyway. Did you get the one about the hungry ghost on Yugu Mountain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lan Zhan, walking a few steps ahead, glanced back at him. \u201cYou were reckless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always reckless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do what needs to be done,\u201d Wei Wuxian argued. And that was true of the hungry ghost on Yugu Mountain. Bound to a local shrine, the ghost had been attacking everyone who came to offer fruit and incense. It should have been an easy exorcism... except the ghost was that of a recently married man, and when his young widow learned a cultivator was on the way, she\u2019d barred the doors to the shrine and locked herself in with him. Her late husband had died in a fire, so the place was already burning with greenish, ghoulish phantom flames by the time Wei Wuxian had arrived. He\u2019d managed to rescue the widow and liberate the ghost, but phantom flames burned the soul instead of the body, so it had taken three days of bedrest before he could cast even a paperman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat part was reckless?\u201d he demanded, trying to remember what he said in the letter. There was no way he\u2019d told Lan Zhan the whole truth. \u201cYou mean just because of the fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stopped walking. \u201cWhat fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. \u201cNothing!\u201d Wei Wuxian said quickly. \u201cNothing at all. Even if there had been something, it was almost three months ago, and clearly I\u2019m fine.\u201d When Lan Zhan still didn\u2019t move, \u201cLan <em> Zhan. </em>You worry too much. I came back in one piece, didn\u2019t I? Look at me. I might not have a sword, but I\u2019m far from helpless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, grinning at him, and launched into another story.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upon reaching the Cloud Recesses, Lan Zhan handed Little Apple off to an unfortunate servant and led Wei Wuxian straight past all the guesthouses to the Jingshi. <em> Well, alright then</em>, Wei Wuxian thought. He hadn\u2019t necessarily been expecting Lan Zhan to put him up in a guest room\u2014he\u2019d stayed in the Jingshi before, after all. But that was when they were hiding from Jin Guangyao, when it was Yiling Laozu and Hanguang-jun vs. the entire cultivation world. It had made sense for both of them to hunker down in the Jingshi. Now they weren\u2019t hiding from anyone, and Wei Wuxian planned on staying in the Cloud Recesses a good long while. Allowing of course for frequent travel breaks, so he didn\u2019t lose his everloving mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Would he be staying in the Jingshi just for tonight, because it was already so late? Would Lan Zhan have a room prepared in the guesthouse come morning? Would he notice if Wei Wuxian pretended to sleep there but actually just snuck into the Jingshi every night to listen to Lan Zhan breathe?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All valid questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan must have noticed Wei Wuxian\u2019s hesitation at the threshold, because he asked, \u201cDo you wish to stay elsewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Wuxian said loudly. \u201cNo, this is good. This is great.\u201d He kicked off his shoes and darted past Lan Zhan into the Jingshi, then sheepishly retrieved the shoes and lined them up neatly next to Lan Zhan\u2019s upon receiving a <em> look</em>. The inside of the Jingshi hadn\u2019t changed at all since the last time he\u2019d been here. Moonlight filtered in through the silk-screen walls, there was a guest bed by the window overlooking the bamboo grove out back; Lan Zhan\u2019s guqin sat on its low table, and everything smelled of sandalwood incense, woodsmoke and musk. There was even a jar of Emperor\u2019s Smile on the table in the main room alongside a teapot, two ceramic cups, and a tray with a covered pot leaking steam.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Lan Zhan asked, following Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s soup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat color is it,\u201d Wei Wuxian said suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRed,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Marry me, </em>Wei Wuxian almost said with his actual fucking mouth. Gods, he\u2019d been alone for too long; he\u2019d been talking to himself pretty much constantly and had thus become accustomed to saying whatever he wanted, confident that no one was listening. But now someone very much was listening, and he needed to adjust his behavior accordingly. Instead of proposing to Hanguang-jun, he said, \u201cThank the heavens.\u201d Then he went and plopped down in front of the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he could fill his own bowl, Lan Zhan sat down across from him. Gracefully, holding his white sleeve with one hand so it didn\u2019t trail across the table, he took the lid off the pot and set it aside. He picked up the white porcelain serving spoon and ladled soup into a bowl. He replaced the lid of the pot, then unstoppered the jar of Emperor\u2019s Smile and poured a full cup, and somehow even his pour was beautiful. Each movement was measured and deliberate, like this was a formal ceremony instead of just Wei Wuxian\u2019s dinner. Only after he\u2019d served Wei Wuxian did he reach for the teapot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d said Wei Wuxian, shooing Lan Zhan\u2019s hand away. He poured Lan Zhan a cup of tea. Knowing the Lans, this tea was white, floral, and so astringent it dried out your mouth like biting into an unripe persimmon. But Lan Zhan liked it, and Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t been around to watch him drink disgusting tea for ten whole months, so he didn\u2019t even make fun of it. He just set the cup in front of Lan Zhan and smiled at him, feeling so warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know, Lan Zhan, I think I missed this the most,\u201d he said, starting in on the soup. It was actually pretty good, even lacking any sort of meat. \u201cI thought it would be traveling together or playing music by the cold springs. And I did miss all of that. But I <em> really </em> missed sitting at a table with you, just eating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never just eat,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not born into this sect and therefore \u2018Silence during meals\u2019 does not apply to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian informed him. \u201cThe other four thousand rules I\u2019ll consider following on a case-by-case basis, but that one is simply not going to happen and it\u2019s high time you accepted it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d said Lan Zhan into his teacup.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much peace and quiet is bad for you, you know. It\u2019s bad for your qi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019re a terrible actor and I know you secretly like it when I chatter at you. Sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> missed </em>me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, mostly joking, so he was taken aback when Lan Zhan looked at him and said, \u201cYes.\u201d Flustered, he tossed back an entire cup of liquor, but then Lan Zhan immediately poured him another cup, and that flustered him even more. He wasn\u2019t used to someone paying attention to him like this, anticipating what he wanted and giving it to him for no reason other than that he wanted it. He drank the second cup slowly, savoring the taste, cold and clean like fresh snowmelt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After Wei Wuxian finished his soup, Lan Zhan got to his feet and said, \u201cCome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian got up and followed him, curious. There was a silk-screen door in the northeast corner of the main room, leading out to the small courtyard behind the Jingshi. Lan Zhan paused before it, and for the first time Wei Wuxian examined the scene painted intricately across the silk panels: an ink-wash sea, a gold-leaf sky, and in the center a scarlet phoenix and a brilliant white crane meeting at the surface of the water, their bodies forming a yin-yang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s work,\u201d Lan Zhan murmured.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why your calligraphy is so beautiful,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, nudging him gently. \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying is good at painting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou flatterer, Lan Zhan. Do you want me to paint another portrait of you, is that it? All you have to do is ask. You\u2019re the perfect subject, you sit so still.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPaint whatever you like,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll paint you, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinked at him. Then slid the door open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night air was cool and wet, alive with the chirrup of peeping frogs and the hollow rustle of the bamboo grove. White pebbles and shells crunched beneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s feet when he stepped out into the courtyard. \u201cLan Zhan, it\u2019s cold out,\u201d he complained. \u201cWhy are we\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh, Lan Zhan. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a lotus pond in the center of the courtyard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was small, about the same size as the one he and the Wens had dug into the hard dirt of the Burial Mounds a lifetime ago. The water was dotted with wide, flat leaves, unbloomed lotus pods swaying above them like bells. Wei Wuxian approached the pond almost cautiously, some part of him afraid it wasn\u2019t real, he was dreaming, he\u2019d already gone to sleep and he was dreaming. But his dreams were never this good. He knelt at the edge of the water and trailed his fingers across the surface, moonlight shivering in his wake. In summer the lotuses would bloom, delicate pink petals unfurling to reveal a yellow heart, each flower a little sunrise.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian remembered\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian remembered leaning too far over the side of a rowboat, hand outstretched toward a particularly vibrant flower, <em> shijie, you can wear it in your hair! </em> Losing his balance, toppling headfirst into the water. Breaking the surface with a gasp, Jiang Cheng cackling at him from the boat, Jiang Yanli hiding a smile. <em> Silly Xianxian, at least the water\u2019s warm! </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>His eyes were stinging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lotus pond in the Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He glanced back over his shoulder. Lan Zhan was silhouetted in the doorway to the Jingshi, tall and silent and moon-white, just watching. Wei Wuxian wiped his wet hands on his robes and stood up, trying to get it together. But Lan Zhan knew him, and whatever was on his face made Lan Zhan take a step forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d he said, hesitant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was something hot and bright in Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest. A few inches lower and he\u2019d have thought it was a golden core. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, and the burning thing took over. He closed the few steps between them and threw his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s middle, burying his face in the warm curve of Lan Zhan\u2019s throat. As expected, Lan Zhan went perfectly still, arms remaining stiff and awkward at his sides. He wasn\u2019t breathing, and Wei Wuxian realized abruptly that they\u2019d never embraced before. How absurd\u2014they\u2019d known each other since they were sixteen, they\u2019d fought and traveled and slept side by side; Lan Zhan had literally carried Wei Wuxian\u2019s unconscious body halfway across the country on two separate occasions, and they\u2019d never fucking hugged?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the past ten months he\u2019d had plenty of time to sift through his earliest memories of the Cloud Recesses. They were always too-bright and blurry, like his mind\u2019s eye was squinting against a white winter sun, but he remembered teasing that young, incandescent Lan Zhan. He remembered that at the time, he\u2019d thought wanting to get a rise out of Lan Zhan was born from the same urge as tossing a stone into a tranquil lake just to watch it ripple. It took Wei Wuxian about, oh, two decades to figure out that that wasn\u2019t the only reason he\u2019d wanted the Second Jade of Lan to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembered lying awake in his narrow, uncomfortable Cloud Recesses bed, considering the possibility that Lan Wangji, beneath all the rules and restraint, was just a tiny bit fascinating. And a lot less cold than everyone seemed to think.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been wrong about a lot of things, but not that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy who had knelt in the snow till he fell asleep, waiting for his long-dead mother to open the door. The man who had spent thirteen years mourning someone who didn\u2019t deserve his grief, thirteen years investigating every trace of darkness and chaos, playing <em> Evocation </em>to silence. Lan Xichen had said it was stubbornness, but that wasn\u2019t it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closed his eyes, fingers twisting in the back of Lan Zhan\u2019s robes, and thought, <em> You just love with your whole damn heart</em>. <em> Your heart, your soul, with everything inside you. Not widely, but ocean-deep. You love so hard, don\u2019t you, Lan Zhan? So hard it hurts. You don\u2019t know how to do it any other way. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lotus pond in the Cloud Recesses. Tucked away behind the Jingshi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squeezed Lan Zhan one last time and was about to pull away when Lan Zhan shifted, hands coming up to rest on either side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s spine. Lan Zhan was so solid. His heartbeat was quick and light like rain on a tiled roof. Wei Wuxian almost teased him about it\u2014<em>are you nervous, Lan-er-gege?</em>\u2014but kept his mouth shut. Lan Zhan didn\u2019t touch other people, certainly not like this. Of course he was nervous.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pond wasn\u2019t blooming, but Wei Wuxian could\u2019ve sworn he could smell freshly bloomed lotus flowers, delicate florals layered over the musty earthiness of algae. The smell of home. Not home anymore. He let out a sharp breath against Lan Zhan\u2019s throat, maybe laughing, maybe crying, and for some reason that was what made Lan Zhan shudder and melt the rest of the way, ice cracking on a frozen lake. He wrapped his arms fully around Wei Wuxian\u2019s back and gathered him close, closer, holding him so tight it was hard to breathe. He pressed his face into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair and took a deep breath through his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The imagined scent of Lotus Pier gave way to the real, familiar scent of Lan Zhan, smoky sandalwood and almond, orchid hair oil. He was so warm. If he held Wei Wuxian long enough, would some of that warmth transfer over? Pour into Wei Wuxian like good wine?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, alright,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, stepping back. Lan Zhan\u2019s arms fell away from him and he was cold again; he was always cold these days. \u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan, I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d he said. \u201cA lotus pond in the Cloud Recesses! Don\u2019t tell me your uncle actually approved it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan cleared his throat. \u201cUncle had no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him afterward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa!\u201d Wei Wuxian crowed. \u201cLook at you, the glorious rebel of Gusu! Ah, Hanguang-jun, you better be careful. Your reputation\u2019s only just started to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d said Lan Zhan, oddly intense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll care for both of us, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have never cared about reputations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrection,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, holding up a finger. \u201cI don\u2019t care about <em> my </em>reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan took a breath as if to say something, paused, then finally just said, \u201cBed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That word, in that voice, just felt unfair. \u201cUh-huh,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathed. Following Lan Zhan back into the Jingshi, caught in his wake, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like moonlight on the surface of a lotus pond: insubstantial and easily disturbed, a temporary glimmer on something calm and perfect and full of life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I always had a bad memory, but I think dying made it worse. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the next few days, they fell into a routine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Cloud Recesses were emptier than usual. Zewu-jun was in seclusion, Lan Qiren was paying a visit to Lanling Jin in preparation for an upcoming discussion conference; Sizhui, Wen Ning, and the other junior sect members were on a night hunt to the west, near the border of Gusu and Moling. Wei Wuxian missed Sizhui and Wen Ning and even that little brat Lan Jingyi, but it was nice, having the space to settle in. He\u2019d spent ten months traveling, rarely staying anywhere longer than a night. It was strange, staying. Wanting to stay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said on the fifth morning of waking up in the Jingshi. \u201cHave you heard of Yinhe Temple?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t answer for a moment. He was in the middle of writing some letter or another. One of his duties as Chief Cultivator was to foster communication between the major and minor clans, which he took very seriously, because he was Lan Zhan and he took everything seriously, which was admirable of him, <em> except </em> when it meant Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t talk to him until he\u2019d finished writing one million letters in response to various petty gripes and squabbles between minor clan leaders. Wei Wuxian had read some of Lan Zhan\u2019s letters and they were pretty much just very formal, polite versions of \u2018<em>Figure it out amongst yourselves and stop wasting my time, dumbass.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So far, their days went like this: Lan Zhan woke up at five, meditated for an hour, and began his work. Wei Wuxian usually woke up around eight or nine, meditated for fifteen minutes, multi-tasked eating breakfast and bothering Lan Zhan, got bored, and wandered off in search of something to do. These days he liked wandering around the mountain in a way he wouldn\u2019t have when he was younger. Before he lost himself, before his mind filled with black water and, too exhausted to keep his head up, he slipped under.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meditation was okay, but Wei Wuxian found a lot more peace in birdsong, a thick carpet of pine needles under his shoes, the white-noise rush of terraced waterfalls feeding into a mountain river. He liked running his fingers over rough tree bark, wading into the cold springs, numbing his hands in the icy water and warming them on a sun-baked rock. Physical sensations. Real things he could feel and experience, because he was real and alive in this world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan finished his letter, folded it, and sealed it with the Lan crest. Then he turned his attention to Wei Wuxian. \u201cYinhe Temple?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about as far west as you can go,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, stretching like a cat. He\u2019d been holding lotus pose for what felt like hours. Morning sunlight was streaming into the Jingshi, illuminating Lan Zhan\u2019s papers, the white of his robes, the silver ornament in his hair. \u201cIn the foothills of the Great Desert. On swords the journey would take a week, but\u2014well, you know. On foot it\u2019s probably three. When I was passing through Meishan territory I met a girl who originally hailed from the foothills, and Lan Zhan, she said each summer there\u2019s a Qixi festival at Yinhe Temple that lasts for seven days and seven nights! And it\u2019s not just the typical festival stuff, the best part is that the temple monks spend all seven days and nights sculpting a massive bridge out of desert sand. Pan-guniang said it\u2019s as long and wide as a river, and people travel from all over the country just to walk the length of it. I told her I\u2019d definitely try to make it this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He waited for Lan Zhan to react, but Lan Zhan looked even stiffer than usual. Wei Wuxian would have to scold him about working too much. His poor bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, doesn\u2019t that sound amazing?\u201d he prompted. \u201cI want to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d said Lan Zhan. Again he did nothing but stare silently at the green jade tabletop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>,\u201d Wei Wuxian whined. \u201cCome on, at least think it over. Can\u2019t Zewu-jun come out of seclusion and be Chief Cultivator for a few weeks? The war\u2019s over, everything\u2019s quiet. You can take one little trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At that, Lan Zhan looked up. \u201cYou... wish for me to accompany you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> What. </em>Wei Wuxian snorted. \u201cUh, yes? Obviously you\u2019d be going. First of all, I already told you ten months was enough. Second of all, you\u2019re crazy if you think Little Apple would leave this mountain without you.\u201d When Lan Zhan didn\u2019t respond, Wei Wuxian gave up on lotus pose and scrambled over to join him at the low table. This was another part of their routine: sitting together in the evenings, Wei Wuxian with a drink, Lan Zhan with a cup of tea, steam curling around his pretty face. \u201cLan Zhan, come west with me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, smiling as cutely as possible. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a desert before, I wanna see it with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lips parted. Eyes never leaving Wei Wuxian\u2019s, he gave a small nod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, breaking into a grin. \u201cGood! We can night hunt along the way, how\u2019s that? I miss hunting with a partner, it wasn\u2019t nearly as fun on my own.\u201d Too late, he realized he was veering dangerously close to <em> cultivation partner </em> territory. \u201cAh, I mean... it\u2019s just nice knowing someone\u2019s got your back. I can handle myself, but, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d Lan Zhan took out a fresh ink stick and poured more water onto the grinding stone. \u201cYou mentioned a fire. On Yugu Mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I? That doesn\u2019t sound like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Wei Wuxian said distractedly. He was watching Lan Zhan\u2019s hand as he swirled the ink stick over the grinding stone, black ink bleeding into the water. \u201cIt was, ah.... It was fine. Just a minor complication with an exorcism, but it worked out alright in the end. Lan Zhan, you shouldn\u2019t worry so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan set the ink stick down, cleaning the lampblack off his fingers with a white silk cloth. \u201cYou always do this,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSame as the evil spell you took from Jin Ling. Same as the curse marks from Mo Xuanyu. Same as your core. You get hurt and tell no one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was Wei Wuxian\u2019s turn to fall silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it was me,\u201d said Lan Zhan, \u201cyou told me to stop pretending everything was fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYugu was months ago,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbled. He could feel Lan Zhan watching him. \u201cReally, Lan Zhan. Of course I love it when Hanguang-jun protects me, but I\u2019m not <em> that </em> feeble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAiyo, why is it you only talk this much when it\u2019s time to scold me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere beyond the walls of the Jingshi, a blue thrush started singing its high, flutelike song. Lan Zhan didn\u2019t react to Wei Wuxian\u2019s grumbling at all. He just sat there, a sculpture of white jade, waiting for some sort of answer or explanation. Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t even sure what the question was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, look,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s just... it\u2019s different when it\u2019s me, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause....\u201d Shit, he\u2019d never really thought about this before, let alone tried to voice it. There were a thousand different reasons. A lifetime\u2019s worth of reasons. A reason for every day he ran through the halls of Lotus Pier, for every grain of rice he ate beneath that roof, for every punishment from Madam Yu, for every time Jiang Fengmian praised him while Jiang Cheng sat miserably on the sidelines. A reason for every Wen he\u2019d tried and failed to save. For Wen Qing, who had died so he would live. For Jin Zixuan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For shijie, who had loved him at the end of all things. Wei Wuxian\u2019s name had been cleared of many crimes, but that death was his. That sword was meant for him. There would be no absolution; no forgiveness. That death, not his own, was when Wei Wuxian\u2019s life cracked down the center and shattered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A reason for every scar on Lan Zhan\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sighed. \u201cSometimes I think I was meant to die as a child, alongside my parents,\u201d he said, gazing into the fresh ink on the grinding stone, so black it didn\u2019t reflect the sunlight, just swallowed it. \u201cOr later, torn apart on the streets by wild dogs. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m not trying to sound ungrateful. It\u2019s not like I sit around thinking, \u2018Oh, woe is me, what a monster I became, if only I\u2019d died before any of it happened.\u2019 It\u2019s useless to think like that. But, I don\u2019t know. If there is such a thing as fate, I think it made a mistake with me. I think I was meant to die, but Jiang-shu\u2014Jiang-zongzhu found me. And the Jiang Clan gave me everything, they gave me a life and a home and a golden core, and in return I broke every promise I ever made.\u201d He let out a quiet laugh, shaking his head. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like to dwell on the past, but it\u2019s true that I\u2019ve always been a bit of a burden. I\u2019ve already caused a great deal of trouble and inconvenience for Lan Zhan, haven\u2019t I? So why should I complain about a spell or a couple curse marks, ah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he looked up, he was taken aback by the intensity in Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are not a burden,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cYou are not inconvenient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cBut in this second life I\u2019ve watched the esteemed Hanguang-jun defy his family, his clan, the cultivation world, all orthodoxy, just to stand at my side....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the right thing to do. The only right choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're very clever, I\u2019m sure you could\u2019ve exposed Jin Guangyao for the snake he was <em> without </em> publicly throwing in with the Yiling Laozu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shook his head. \u201cI am not referring to the investigation of Jin Guangyao,\u201d he said. \u201cThe choice I made was Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tried to look calm and collected and not at all like Lan Zhan had just delivered the exact words he\u2019d been longing to hear since he was sixteen. \u201cHah,\u201d he said weakly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan picked up his bamboo brush again, dipping it in the ink and starting a new letter. Even just responding to someone\u2019s petty grievance, his handwriting was a study in flawless calligraphy, each stroke a tiny, precise movement of the wrist. It was particularly captivating for Wei Wuxian, who could paint and design talismans but whose handwriting had once been described by Lan Qiren as \u2018an utter disgrace.\u2019 Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t a painter, but he was an artist all the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> anyway</em>,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, moving right the fuck along. \u201cNow that I\u2019m back, I\u2019d like to night hunt with you. Think about it, Lan Zhan! We could travel from village to village, and with your Gusu Lan coffers we wouldn\u2019t even have to sleep on the road. And if we did run out of silver, you could just sit in the market and play your guqin. I made pretty decent money doing that, and that was just me and Chenqing. Imagine what we could make with a face like Hanguang-jun\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWest, then,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like, you\u2019ll go? For Qixi? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beamed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I always had a bad memory, but I think dying made it worse. I don\u2019t just forget faces anymore. There\u2019s whole stretches of time gone, where I\u2019ve learned from other people\u2019s accounts that the Wei Wuxian of then was in Lotus Pier, Caiyi, Qinghe, Baifeng Mountain, but I don\u2019t remember a lot of it. Most of my childhood is still here, and thank the gods for that, thank you, I don\u2019t want to forget the lotus lakes, sunlight on the water and boats scattered across the surface like that children\u2019s game, you know the one. Do you? Maybe you don\u2019t, considering what I know about your uncle. The game where you make a little pile of joss sticks and take turns picking out one at a time, and the rule is if you disturb any of the other sticks you lose. You have to sit still and move slow and concentrate really hard. Lan Zhan ah, it won\u2019t shock you to learn I was terrible at it! Shijie won every time. I didn\u2019t care because I always lost in the first round, but Jiang Cheng\u2014oh, his face got so red. Anyway, the long boats scattered like that, and when I was little I always imagined a giant hand coming down to pluck one of them right out of the water. I still remember that. So it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s some sort of price I\u2019m paying, I\u2019ll happily give up every memory of the Sunshot Campaign for one moment of shijie. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Scattered like joss sticks, that\u2019s how it is in my head these days! Scraps of memory all over the place and I\u2019m not sure how they fit together, how many are real, how to touch one without disturbing another and maybe losing it forever. But if I\u2019m very careful I can pluck one off the top of the pile and guess what, Lan Zhan? It\u2019s you. Almost always. You in the cold springs, you in the sun-dappled woods, in a rain of flower petals, in a dark cavern, blood on your robes. You in the Library Pavilion, young and furious. My fault! How insufferable I was. I couldn\u2019t help it, Lan Zhan. I just wanted you to look at me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The junior sect members returned the next day, Wen Ning trailing after them like a mother goose after goslings. The first thing Sizhui and Jingyi did, bless them, was report to Lan Zhan, so Wei Wuxian was woken just after dawn by two bright little voices calling <em> Hanguang-jun! Hanguang-jun! </em>from outside the Jingshi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLoud noise is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses!\u201d he yelled back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was quiet for a moment. Then came Sizhui\u2019s tentative voice, \u201cWei-qianbei?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighed and got up to open the door. Jingyi immediately stuck his head inside, lighting up the moment he saw Wei Wuxian. It was actually pretty adorable; maybe Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t throttle him after all. \u201cWei-qianbei!\u201d Jingyi said, then remembered himself and greeted Lan Zhan with a bow and a cutely deferential, \u201cHanguang-jun.\u201d Then to Wei Wuxian, \u201cWei-qianbei! You\u2019re back!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, resigning himself to an early morning. The Jingshi only had the one bedroom, so Wei Wuxian had been sleeping in the main room where Lan Zhan did his work. Lan Zhan kept trying to give him the bedroom and Wei Wuxian kept refusing. He liked that the first thing he heard in the morning, before even opening his eyes, was the whisper of an ink-brush on paper. He liked that he opened his eyes to Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-qianbei!\u201d said Sizhui, appearing at Jingyi\u2019s shoulder. He bowed properly to both Lan Zhan and Wei Wuxian, then straightened up and gave Wei Wuxian a toothy smile, because he was the nicest kid to ever exist. \u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hesitated. He knew what he wanted the answer to be, but....</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor as long as Lan Zhan allows it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor as long as Wei Ying wishes,\u201d Lan Zhan said at the exact same time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They looked at each other. Jingyi snorted, then turned it into the fakest cough Wei Wuxian had ever heard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sizhui cleared his throat. \u201cAh, so... Hanguang-jun, Wei-qianbei! We hunted a jackal king!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A jackal\u2014? \u201cAi ai ai!\u201d Wei Wuxian said loudly, trying not to shudder. \u201cNo! If it\u2019s a jackal anything, I don\u2019t want to hear about it. Just tell me whether or not you upheld the illustrious name of Lan, and then I\u2019ll leave and you can give all the gory details to Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe defeated it with minimal property damage and zero civilian injuries,\u201d Sizhui rattled off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt had eight legs,\u201d Jingyi added.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian, in the middle of putting on his socks, nearly fell over. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to know!\u201d he squawked. \u201cI\u2019ve saved your life how many times and you repay me like this? By giving me nightmares about horrible eight-legged monster dogs? Hanguang-jun! Banish him from the sect!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2014you can\u2019t do that!\u201d said Jingyi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jingyi rounded on Lan Zhan. \u201cHanguang-jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, now you\u2019re shouting at His Excellency, the Chief Cultivator?\u201d Wei Wuxian shook his head. \u201cBanishment for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said mildly. \u201cThere is no need to antagonize the junior sect members.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d said Jingyi, sticking out his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe disrespect,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cDoes the title Yiling Laozu mean nothing anymore? Do I not strike fear into your tiny baby hearts? I feel like I should strike more fear than I am currently striking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have seen you with the rabbits,\u201d Lan Zhan said gravely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian buried his face in his hands. \u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan.... This is terrible, I\u2019m not scary at all anymore.... Maybe I should go on a crime spree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d said Jingyi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we come?\u201d said Jingyi. Sizhui looked worried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately you cannot,\u201d amended Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jingyi\u2019s shoulders slumped. Sizhui, visibly relieved, patted his shoulder in consolation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Zhan addressed the two juniors. \u201cYou may deliver a full report in the Elegance Room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Hanguang-jun!\u201d they said at once, leaping to attention. It was so damn sweet, how much they looked up to him. How much they loved him. Lan Qiren had inspired discipline and respect, but nothing like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With one last glance at Wei Wuxian, Lan Zhan led the juniors back outside and slid the door shut behind them. Then it was quiet again. Dawn light crept across the floor. Outside, the swallows were singing the coming day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian took a shaky breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was ridiculous, being this affected by a smile. Not even a smile. Just that soft, dark-eyed look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon Wei Wuxian found Lan Zhan in the main courtyard, speaking with Wen Ning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-gongzi!\u201d Wen Ning called out, waving like a drowning man hailing a ship, as if worried Wei Wuxian would somehow miss him. \u201cWei-gongzi! You\u2019re back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, stepping up to them. He smiled at Lan Zhan and then ruffled Wen Ning\u2019s hair the way he used to do with Jiang Cheng. Of course Jiang Cheng had despised it; Wen Ning looked shyly pleased. \u201cHow were your travels? <em> Don\u2019t </em> tell me about the jackal king, I\u2019ve heard more than enough already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been going well, Wei-gongzi,\u201d Wen Ning said. \u201cI\u2014I like night hunting with the Lan Clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re very competent, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cWen Ning, eat with us in the Jingshi tonight. I want to hear all about your latest grand adventure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wen Ning\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWei-gongzi, are you sure? Hanguang-jun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure I\u2019m sure. And Lan Zhan\u2019s fine with it, aren\u2019t you, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wen Ning didn\u2019t seem to realize it, but he\u2019d very much earned a spot on Lan Zhan\u2019s list of approved people, places, and things. Categories: \u2018People Lan Zhan Trusts With Wei Ying and Sizhui\u2019s Well-being,\u2019 \u2018People Jiang Wanyin Hates,\u2019 and \u2018People Who Do Not Make Excessive Noise.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nodded. \u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, there you go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d said Wen Ning, ducking his head bashfully. \u201cThank you, Wei-gongzi, Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After Wen Ning took his leave to go rest up in the guesthouse, Wei Wuxian turned to Lan Zhan. \u201cHow was Sizhui\u2019s report?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow\u2019d he do on the hunt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan never missed an opportunity to praise his son. \u201cHe did well,\u201d he said, which meant Sizhui had done fucking fantastic and Lan Zhan was brimming with pride. \u201cThe others and Wen Qionglin, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got high hopes for this new generation.\u201d Wei Wuxian slipped his hand into Lan Zhan\u2019s and tugged him along, leading him back through the main courtyard, past Zewu-jun\u2019s Hanshi and the Jingshi on its gently sloping hill, to the mountain path that led to the cold springs. He didn\u2019t actually have any plans to soak in the springs, it was just a nice afternoon and Lan Zhan had been busy with important-person things all morning and Wei Wuxian wanted him all to himself, at least for a couple hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woods were cool and bright, bamboo groves thinning out into a forest of fir trees and red pine. Swallows sang all around them, flitting overhead, flashes of blue. After a while Lan Zhan adjusted his grip on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand, lacing their fingers together. His hand was big and warm and dry. The lace of his sleeves tickled Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist. If someone saw them walking so close together like this, holding hands, they\u2019d probably assume\u2014well. Wei Wuxian smiled at his feet and thought about the song Lan Zhan had composed. He still didn\u2019t know the title.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wrote a song,\u201d he said casually, swinging their hands between them, \u201cI\u2019d call it \u2018Ode to a Lotus Pond High in the Clouds.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a good title.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll write it. Maybe I\u2019ll write a whole collection, and it\u2019ll be so good that your poor uncle will be forced to put it in the Library Pavilion, and I shall leave my mark upon the Cloud Recesses forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already have,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cSix hundred and seventy-three times over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait a minute, are you saying only six hundred and seventy-three of the new rules are because of me?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked, dismayed. \u201cIt\u2019s really not the whole thousand? Who inspired the other ones, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome were written in the aftermath of the war,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cSome arose naturally; new generations always beget new rules.\u201d He paused. \u201cMany were Lan Jingyi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLove that kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo were Sizhui.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNo, really? Which two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is forbidden to transport cicada eggs indoors. It is even more forbidden to hide cicada eggs amongst the linens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was an unusually cold spring. He worried the cicadas might freeze. Half the sect woke up crawling with nymphs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Love </em> that kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMany were me,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stopped walking. They\u2019d long since passed the cold springs and were making their way down the mountainside now, roughly parallel to one of the white mountain streams, the tumbling water a low roar in the background below the birdsong and the hushing leaves. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. Anger was rising in his throat just like it had the first time he\u2019d seen the whip scars on Lan Zhan\u2019s back. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have made my mistakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That stung, and Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t hide it fast enough. He swallowed and made to let go of Lan Zhan\u2019s hand, but Lan Zhan just held him tighter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were not one of them,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath stuttered. He wanted a lot of things. Most of them involved kissing Lan Zhan. There were definitely reasons not to do that, but it was getting harder and harder to remember them, especially with Lan Zhan looking at him like this, earnest but guarded; his shy face. The sunlight brought out the dark, earthy browns in his black hair, the strange gold of his eyes. He was icy jade in moonlight, soft and human in the sun. Glowing either way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m yours</em>, Wei Wuxian tried to communicate telepathically. <em> I\u2019m yours, I\u2019m yours, just take me</em>. Before he\u2019d died, so many people had wanted him for themselves, wanted him as a mindless servant, a secret weapon, a trump card, a bargaining chip. The hypocrisy had disgusted him then; it disgusted him now. He was his own. But he was also Lan Zhan\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make any mistakes with me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, finding Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou did everything you could. It\u2019s just I was never going to listen. Okay? None of it was your fault, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStubborn,\u201d Wei Wuxian scolded him gently, and then, since they were now in the business of embracing, he let go of Lan Zhan\u2019s hand only to step into his arms, pressing his cheek to Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. This time Lan Zhan melted immediately, arms coming up around Wei Wuxian\u2019s back. He smoothed one hand down the curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closed his eyes and let himself be held. He could feel Lan Zhan\u2019s breaths in his hair, warm on the shell of his ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he murmured, finding it easier to be honest when he didn\u2019t have to make eye contact. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we ever do this before? We should be doing this all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s arms tightened around him. He nodded against Wei Wuxian\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we go west, I think you\u2019ll have to hold me a lot,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Great Desert gets freezing at night even when it\u2019s boiling hot during the day, and I get cold so easily now, I\u2019m really very delicate. Lan Zhan will have to keep me warm so I don\u2019t freeze, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was expecting a huff of amusement or an admonishing <em> \u2018Wei Ying,\u2019 </em> but Lan Zhan just nodded again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you\u2014you don\u2019t actually have to,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, guilt squirming in his belly. He knew damn well that Lan Zhan had a complex about Wei Wuxian experiencing any sort of discomfort whatsoever, and it wasn\u2019t fair to play into it like that. \u201cI was kidding, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d said Lan Zhan, holding him even tighter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Wei Wuxian in a tiny voice. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They held each other like that for a long time, the woods alive and breathing around them, until the sunlight deepened from pale to honey-gold. Then it was time to head back up the mountain, back to the Cloud Recesses, to dinner with Wen Ning and whatever came after. Lan Zhan looked just as reluctant to part as Wei Wuxian felt, but they held hands for the whole walk back. And somehow, that was just as good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> How funny, I knew I\u2019d miss you, but missing isn\u2019t the right word for this. I miss hot baths and good liquor. I miss waking to guqin music. I miss watching your hands like golden sparrows hopping from string to string. I do not miss silence except the silence with you; I do miss the scent of sandalwood and orchid and even your bland meals, really, how much tofu can one person eat? Well, I miss these things only sometimes, when I\u2019m reminded of them, and I miss you always, and I am reminded of you always: you live inside me. Ahh! That\u2019s dramatic! You\u2019ll never read this, but if you did, I think you might disapprove. Does the Cloud Recesses have a principle forbidding excessive displays of emotion? Almost certainly. Over four thousand rules now, right? How many were conceived in direct response to that troublemaker Wei Wuxian? Some people inspire poetry; I inspire new laws. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> But you\u2019re pretty good at breaking them, aren\u2019t you? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> If I said that out loud, I think it would hurt you. I think you\u2019d hear it in your uncle\u2019s voice. But it\u2019s me, Lan Zhan, and you have to know I don\u2019t mean it like failure, I mean it like you\u2019re the best, you\u2019re just the best, you\u2019re so good. Sweet Lan Zhan in the moonlight with your twin white jars. I\u2019d come back from the dead just for that. When I tell you it\u2019s a revelation to watch you pour liquor, please know it has nothing to do with you breaking the rules. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thirteen years later, Caiyi Town hadn\u2019t changed much. The docks were loud and bustling, the market street still lined with stalls selling children\u2019s toys and paper lanterns and sugar-blown animals, scallion pancakes and roasted hazelnuts and steamed buns and hot fried buns and baskets of sunset-orange persimmons\u2014no loquats this time of year. And yes, Emperor\u2019s Smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nudged Lan Zhan, nodding at the rows of white porcelain jars. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cDo you need permission?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re <em> Chief Cultivator </em> now,\u201d Wei Wuxian said loftily. \u201cWho knows, maybe you\u2019re even stricter than you used to be. Maybe you\u2019ll make me copy the Lan Sect Principles another thousand times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can make you do anything,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughed. \u201cQuite the opposite, actually. You\u2019re maybe the only person who could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been walking alongside one of the winding canals that cut through town, not going anywhere in particular, just enjoying the sunlight. It was warmer here at the foot of the mountain than up at the Cloud Recesses, the sky a perfect forget-me-not blue. Winter wouldn\u2019t take hold of the valley for another month yet, but the hills were snow-white with blooming loquat trees. In early spring, the tiny star-shaped flowers would bear their golden fruit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPersimmons!\u201d one of the vendors shouted. \u201cRipe persimmons! First of the season!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFresh prawns! Fresh prawns caught just this morning!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuniang, don\u2019t you want a new ribbon for your hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was beautiful here, but seeing the Caiyi market made Wei Wuxian miss the riverside markets of Yunmeng. He missed spicy pork buns and baskets of lotus root, fish cakes shaped like lotus flowers. He missed steaming bowls of noodles speckled with white crawfish meat, swimming in chili oil. He missed the men who darted around with bundles of fat red chili peppers strapped to their backs, the fishermen\u2019s wives who squatted over baskets of the morning\u2019s catch, gossiping loudly and giving the stink-eye to anyone who dared interrupt. Wei Wuxian missed the clam-shucking girls. The heaps of dried river shrimp and shiny black mud snails. The ever-present smell of fish and river muck. The chaos\u2014wives and servants and cooks all swarming around the straw birdcages at the fowl stall, pointing to the fattest chickens, shouting at the stall owner to squeeze them by the neck to prove he hadn\u2019t shoved pebbles down their gullets to make them heavier, then shouting at him over the price. It was always loud and overwhelming and messy, just how Wei Wuxian liked it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He missed Yunmeng. He\u2019d always miss it. But it hadn\u2019t been his home for a long time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan was looking at him, expectant. Wei Wuxian tried to remember what on earth they\u2019d been talking about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Lan Zhan said, \u201cYou can buy whatever you want. You can do whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart pattered like summer rain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If someone like Jiang Cheng had told him \u2018<em>you can do whatever you want</em>,\u2019 he\u2019d mean it like: \u2018<em>Do whatever you want, see if I care.\u2019 </em> That wasn\u2019t how Lan Zhan said it. He said it like this was a fundamental truth, a known law of the world. He said it like: <em> \u2018In the past you couldn\u2019t do whatever you wanted, but things are different now.\u2019 </em> It was strange, because from Wei Wuxian\u2019s perspective, he\u2019d spent the majority of his life being selfish and doing whatever the fuck he wanted, and that was how he\u2019d ended up universally reviled and dead at twenty-one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But if Lan Zhan wanted to spoil him, he certainly wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bold statement, Hanguang-jun,\u201d he said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cWhat if I want....\u201d <em> You. You. Just you. In the sunlight. In early spring when the loquats fall. In the Jingshi. In my bed. In yours. </em> \u201cA jewel for each finger and... and a set of mulberry silk robes for every day of the week so I never repeat one, and... um....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA solid gold divan,\u201d Lan Zhan suggested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! A solid\u2014sorry, what?\u201d Wei Wuxian stared at him. \u201cA solid gold divan? Did you just make that up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne such item was reportedly found amongst the possessions of former Jin zongzhu Jin Jinhai after his death. Three generations ago now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t even be comfortable!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGods, of course it was a Jin.\u201d Wei Wuxian made a face, then thought of Jin Zixuan and tamped it down. \u201cWell, whatever, don\u2019t worry about getting me one of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted. And the jewels?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waved a hand. \u201cForget all of it. Just pour my drinks forever and I\u2019ll be perfectly happy, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinked, then nodded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, and started off again. There was a stall selling chestnut cakes up ahead, sugar and honey sticky-sweet in the air. \u201cLan Zhan! I haven\u2019t had one of these in ages!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d just stepped up to the cake stall when a woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cHey! Handsome gongzi! Come buy a comb for your wife!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was the auntie at the next stall over, perched on a stool behind a counter heaped with an assortment of combs and ribbons and hair sticks and other little ornaments. The moment Wei Wuxian caught her eye, she started beckoning wildly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, gongzi, there\u2019s not a girl out there who doesn\u2019t want a comb from her young man!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything from bamboo to the finest jade, so don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t afford to spoil her a little! You have to show your wife she\u2019s appreciated, you know. You can\u2019t let the romance die just because you\u2019re married!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d Wei Wuxian said, inching closer just so she\u2019d lower her voice. He could feel Lan Zhan at his back. \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t have a wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looked scandalized. \u201cBut you\u2019re so handsome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d He laughed awkwardly and tried to make desperate <em> save me! </em>eye contact with Lan Zhan, who of course had chosen this exact moment to be wholly focused on a comb of white jade, the useless lump. \u201cThank you, that\u2019s very\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you must want a wife!\u201d the auntie said. \u201cHow old are you, twenty-five? Both my sons were married with sons of their own by your age! Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t even have a sweetheart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More like thirty-five, actually, but Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t about to get into the semantics of weird cultivator aging with her. Also, he\u2019d been dead for thirteen of those years. So who knew what counted and what didn\u2019t, in the end. <em>Also, </em>\u201cI\u2019m really not looking,\u201d he said with a polite smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you do have a sweetheart!\u201d She must have caught something in his expression, because she broke into a grin and crowed, \u201cHa! I knew it! Women can always tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, panicking a little, hyper-aware of Lan Zhan\u2019s presence less than five feet away. \u201cNo, sorry, no sweethearts here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her eyes glinted. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, you can ask anyone around and they\u2019ll tell you my niece Kang Kueifei is the prettiest maiden in Caiyi!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, they were done here. \u201cMany thanks, I\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. He took a big step sideways, reaching out blindly until his fingers found the soft, flowy fabric of Lan Zhan\u2019s sleeve. \u201cSo sorry, my friend and I have to be going. He\u2019s very important, very busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a comb? Just in case? It\u2019s an investment in your future!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite sure, thank you kindly,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, and dragged Lan Zhan away from the stall and around the corner onto a narrower street, the ground packed dirt instead of cobblestone. He finally let go of Lan Zhan\u2019s sleeve and rounded on him. \u201cLan Zhan! You really just left me to fend for myself back there!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMadam Comb-seller was not a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather face a horde of fierce corpses than one tenacious matchmaking auntie any day,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cThat was a nightmare. I didn\u2019t even get a cake for my suffering!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In response, Lan Zhan held out a little paper sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth dropped open, all grievances forgotten. How sly! He hadn\u2019t even noticed Lan Zhan buying it. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said happily, accepting the cake. It was almost too pretty to eat, warm and crumbly and beeswax-yellow, stamped with the image of a four-petaled flower. Wei Wuxian made a mental note to do some research re: inventing a spell that could make his entire life smell of honey and rock sugar and chestnut paste, like, all the time. In the name of scientific advancement. He beamed at Lan Zhan, eyes crinkling. \u201cThank you, you\u2019re the best, you\u2019re my favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s ears were wonderfully pink. \u201cMm,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shoved half the cake in his mouth just so he didn\u2019t do something crazy like beg Lan Zhan to kiss him. That would be too much. It felt impossible that he could have even this; that he could stand here on a dusty street in Caiyi with his favorite person in the world, this endlessly kind person who bought him sweets and liquor and all the other things he wanted but didn\u2019t need, who protected him and let him sleep in and said ridiculous things like <em> \u2018you can do whatever you want\u2019 </em>and actually meant it. And somehow, somehow, this was real. There was no time limit, no war on the red horizon, no bounty on Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. No foreseeable reason for this to end. That, more than anything else, was the part Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around. Because this had to end, didn\u2019t it? It was so good, it was really so good, it couldn\u2019t possibly last. He\u2019d never known a bright thing that wasn\u2019t snuffed out. He wanted to stay at Lan Zhan\u2019s side forever, but wouldn\u2019t Lan Zhan get sick of him eventually?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well.... Until then, Wei Wuxian would take whatever Lan Zhan was willing to give, for however long he was willing to give it, and he would not ask for more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until then:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wide blue sky. A lack of fear. Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian held out the other half of the chestnut cake to Lan Zhan. \u201cHere, you try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s for Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I want to share it. It\u2019s not often I have something to share.\u201d He channeled Sizhui, doing his best hopeful fawn eyes. \u201cPlease, Lan Zhan? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you eat something sweet, don\u2019t deny me the satisfaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighed. Wei Wuxian was expecting him to take the paper sleeve, so when Lan Zhan simply leaned down and took a neat, careful bite of the cake, lips almost brushing Wei Wuxian\u2019s fingers, he had to bodily restrain himself from squeaking.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d said Lan Zhan, straightening up as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened and he ate from Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand all the time. Gods, Wei Wuxian should be so lucky<em>. </em> \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Wei Wuxian cleared his throat. \u201cYou want more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s for Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d He finished off the cake, licking honey off his fingers as he thought about what they should do next. They\u2019d already been through the market, but he didn\u2019t feel like going back to the Cloud Recesses just yet. \u201cHey, wanna go get a drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Hm?\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA drink,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated. \u201cYou know, you actually look a little flushed, Lan Zhan. Let\u2019s go find a place to sit down, okay? I\u2019ll buy you all the fancy flavorless tea your heart desires.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring any money,\u201d Lan Zhan pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pouted at him. \u201cYou\u2019re my zhiji, what\u2019s mine is yours. And the other way round.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yes,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, smiling at him. \u201cC\u2019mon then, let\u2019s get you out of the sun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They found a nice restaurant just off the docks. The owner recognized Lan Zhan and bowed about a dozen times, babbling on about what an honor it was to serve the esteemed Hanguang-jun and his, ah, companion. He set them up at the back of the restaurant behind a privacy screen, and two waiters showed up immediately with bowls of figs and pickled vegetables and jars of Emperor's Smile and a pot of what was apparently the finest oolong in Gusu, aged forty years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could get used to this kind of service!\u201d said Wei Wuxian after the waiters left, leaning across the table to pour Lan Zhan\u2019s tea. \u201cIt's funny, I noticed they didn\u2019t refer to you as His Excellency. It\u2019s always nice to remember that the common people don\u2019t give a shit about cultivator politics. They just know Hanguang-jun keeps the bad things away.\u201d He winked. \u201cWell, most of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gave him a flat look. He picked up his teacup but didn\u2019t drink, which was unusual, as Lan Zhan did not fidget or otherwise make gratuitous movements.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was quiet for a long moment. Then, almost hesitant, \u201cThe comb seller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waited for an elaboration that didn\u2019t come. \u201c...Uh, yes? What about her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you... is that something you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, a comb?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian was shocked into laughter. But Lan Zhan didn\u2019t lift his eyes from his tea, and now that Wei Wuxian was looking, he can tell Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders were even stiffer than usual. Holy shit, he wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Wei Wuxian said weakly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat she said was not inaccurate,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cYou are... past the proper age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you, and you\u2019re not married,\u201d Wei Wuxian pointed out. \u201cDo you want a wife? Is that what this is about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stared at him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, then realized how that sounded and scrambled to save it. \u201cBecause\u2014because if you did find a wife, Sizhui would have to get used to a third p\u2014a third, um, adult person hanging around, and that would be way too confusing for him.\u201d Oh, mother of fuck, that was a million times worse. \u201cBut then again he\u2019s the best kid in the world, so I\u2019m sure it would be fine and he\u2019d just be super excited for you. If you got married, I mean. Because he cares about your happiness. As do I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cI do not want a wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian said helplessly, wondering why monsters and hungry ghosts never attacked when you needed them to. \u201cThank you for that information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you,\u201d Lan Zhan repeated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2014no,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. He was doing this sexy new thing where he didn\u2019t lie to Lan Zhan, but gods, this conversation was a nightmare. \u201cNo, I\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the cards.\u201d Lan Zhan\u2019s brow furrowed slightly and Wei Wuxian realized he hadn\u2019t actually answered the question; he\u2019d answered around it. It was unfair of him, especially considering Lan Zhan had clearly exhausted his \u2018verbal intimacy\u2019 reserves and was going to let him get away with the non-answer. That was no good. Wei Wuxian took a steadying breath and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want a wife. I will never want a wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An excruciating pause, then Lan Zhan nodded. He took a sip of tea. His face was completely unreadable, even to Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, pouring himself another drink. \u201cGood talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t drunk, it was just that the world was swaying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been clinging to Lan Zhan for the better part of an hour, first during the walk back through Caiyi to the docks and then on the sword-ride back to the Cloud Recesses. Lan Zhan had wanted to just get a room in town for the night, doubting Wei Wuxian\u2019s abilities to hold onto him if they rode Bichen, which was silly of him, as these days there was nothing Wei Wuxian did better than hold on to Lan Zhan, and nothing he liked to do more. It only took a bit of wheedling before Lan Zhan caved, and Wei Wuxian was allowed the fantastic experience of stepping up onto Bichen and hugging Lan Zhan as tight as he could, one of Lan Zhan\u2019s arms wrapped firmly around his back, for the entire trip back up the mountain. The less fantastic part was when the sword rose high enough that the air grew cool and wet with drifting clouds, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart lurched with a visceral memory of the last time he\u2019d been suspended in the air like this, and how it ended. He\u2019d closed his eyes, pressed his face to Lan Zhan\u2019s neck, and breathed deeply, sandalwood and almond. That helped a lot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before long they'd descended into the Cloud Recesses like a leaf sinking slowly through water. Lan Zhan had stepped off the sword, Wei Wuxian stumbling down after him, and they\u2019d crunched their way over the white shell courtyard to the Jingshi, and here they were, and Wei Wuxian was <em> not </em> drunk, just off-balance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve lost a lot of blood but like, in a good way,\u201d he mused aloud as Lan Zhan slid open the door to the Jingshi, leading him inside. Wei Wuxian tripped over the threshold and didn\u2019t fall only because Lan Zhan caught him. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that,\u201d he said, and snorted at his own joke, laughing into Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan.... Remember the first time we met? Well, technically the second time. When I snuck into the Cloud Recesses. There was a full moon just like tonight. Remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were so funny,\u201d Wei Wuxian continued as Lan Zhan walked him over to the bed. He sat down heavily and grabbed a handful of Lan Zhan\u2019s robes when he started to move away. \u201cNoooo, don\u2019t go, I\u2019m telling you how funny you were. Are. Did you know, Lan Zhan, I think you\u2019re the funniest person I\u2019ve ever met. Nobody knows how funny you are! People are so dumb\u2014<em>ai ai ai Lan Zhan</em>! Don\u2019t go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d said Lan Zhan. He knelt at Wei Wuxian\u2019s feet. \u201cNo shoes in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little dazed, Wei Wuxian peered down at him, this kneeling Lan Zhan. He was so graceful even with this: tugging Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoes off. Disappearing briefly to put them with the other shoes that were lined up just outside the door, and Wei Wuxian took a moment to get emotional about that: that his black shoes had a permanent spot next to Lan Zhan\u2019s pretty white boots, because he <em> lived </em> here, he wasn\u2019t a guest. Lan Zhan returned and knelt down again to remove Wei Wuxian\u2019s socks, cupping his ankle in one big, warm hand. In the low light Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t white jade, he was pure gold. His hair was deepest black, his eyes darker than usual, a lovely, shifting color like autumn leaves rippling in a light breeze. He was trying to look exasperated, but his mouth was doing something sweet.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t drunk enough to say \u2018<em>You\u2019re stunning,\u2019 </em> but he thought it very hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d he said, and patted Lan Zhan\u2019s cheek twice, pat-pat, like he would a rabbit. \u201cWhat an honor it is to know you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Water,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan got to his feet again, ignoring Wei Wuxian\u2019s noise of protest. It took one thousand years for him to go <em> all </em> the way over to the table, pour a cup of water from the copper teapot, and come <em> all </em>the way back again. It was like he was moving slow on purpose! Damn the elegance of the Lan! Wei Wuxian wanted Lan Zhan and water, in that order, and he had never been patient.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink,\u201d said Lan Zhan, holding out the cup.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t resist teasing him. \u201cOnly if you sit with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>.\u201d Wei Wuxian scooted over and patted the space beside him. \u201cSit with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stared at each other. Wei Wuxian tried to look innocent. He was innocent. He was just warm and drifting and wanted Lan Zhan closer, that was all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighed and sat on the edge of the bed, leaving a deliberate hand\u2019s-length between them. He faced Wei Wuxian, back and shoulders straight, and offered the cup again. For a moment Wei Wuxian saw two Lan Zhans: the current one, and the Lan Zhan who had offered him a stolen lotus pod, awkward and lovely in the middle of a misty lake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. He drained the cup sloppily, water trailing down his chin and throat. \u201cLook at you, taking care of me. Last time it was the other way round, remember that?\u201d He shook his head, tsking. \u201cNever mind, I guess you don\u2019t. You\u2019re a menace when you\u2019re drunk, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou said I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t. But I asked if you liked rabbits and you were like, \u2018<em>yyyeaaahh</em>,\u2019 and it was the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my whole life. It was so funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Lan Zhan repeated, doubtful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always funny. I don\u2019t know how other people don\u2019t see it.\u201d Wei Wuxian set the cup aside and scooted closer, studying Lan Zhan\u2019s face in the candlelight. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he said again, softer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOther people don\u2019t,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d His expression shifted into something almost embarrassed. \u201cWei Ying should sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ignored him. \u201cThey\u2019re all fools,\u201d he declared, gesturing grandly. \u201cEveryone should look at you all the time. Oh no, actually I take it back, you\u2019d hate that. How\u2019s this: I\u2019ll look at you twice as much to make up for everyone else\u2019s slacking off.\u201d He rubbed his nose, lost in thought. \u201cAh, how much did I drink....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was too bright in here. Wei Wuxian waved a hand and all the candles in the room snuffed out at once, nine tendrils of smoke rising up like the tails of a fox spirit. The warm yellow light was replaced by blue moonlight filtering in through the silk-screen walls. He blinked, feeling like he\u2019d been plunged underwater, everything slow and dark and still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reached out to take Lan Zhan\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nodded. In the blue dark, his eyes were unwavering on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. Everything about him was unwavering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I first woke up in that room,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, \u201csurrounded by talismans and blood, and I saw the curse marks on my arm and realized what Mo Xuanyu had done to summon me....\u201d He huffed, shaking his head. \u201cI thought, \u2018Aiyo, that bastard. I wish he\u2019d just left me alone. I wish I was still dead.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan was silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a terrible thing to say to you, of all people,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cWhat a cruel thing. But it\u2019s true. I hadn\u2019t seen you yet. I didn\u2019t know you were mourning me, I really didn\u2019t think anyone would mourn me, Lan Zhan. It\u2019s not sad, it\u2019s just how it is. Who would mourn the Yiling Laozu? He died and the world rejoiced.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mourn the Yiling Laozu,\u201d Lan Zhan said, quiet but fierce. \u201cI mourned Wei Ying of Yunmeng.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nodded. \u201cI know, I know. But when I first woke up.... It\u2019s true that I don\u2019t remember any of those thirteen years. But Lan Zhan, I think maybe I was somewhere peaceful, just sleeping. I never told you this, but in the last few months leading up to\u2014you know\u2014I pretty much stopped sleeping. I felt like I was going crazy. I guess I kind of was. Anyway, I\u2019d finally gotten a chance to sleep, and then Mo Xuanyu had the nerve to wake me up! Ah, I was so annoyed. I didn\u2019t want to be in this world again.\u201d He made a face. \u201cI\u2019m always cold here. Not \u2018here\u2019 as in the Cloud Recesses, but everywhere. The world aches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan whispered. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, brushing a thumb over the inside of Lan Zhan\u2019s wrist. \u201cLan Zhan. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s different now, I don\u2019t feel like that anymore. I want to be here. I want to be alive. Maybe I don\u2019t deserve this second chance, but I want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan took Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand in both of his own and squeezed. \u201cBe here,\u201d he rasped. \u201cBe alive, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Wuxian tipped forward till his forehead hit Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah, sweetheart. That sounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometime in the black hours before dawn, Wei Wuxian woke feeling warmer than he had in a long time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His spine was up against the side of the bed frame. There was another body in his bed on the side between him and the room. Wei Wuxian might have panicked, except everything smelled like sandalwood. The blankets, his pillow, the body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispered, and scooted closer, wrapping an arm around Lan Zhan\u2019s waist. Lan Zhan was sleeping on his back like a proper Lan, hands folded over his stomach. At some point he\u2019d removed his hair ornament and his forehead ribbon. He was still wearing his regular robes, not his sleep clothes. That was Wei Wuxian\u2019s fault; he vaguely remembered wrapping himself around Lan Zhan and refusing to let him leave the bed even for an instant. And Lan Zhan, strangely indulgent of Wei Wuxian\u2019s nonsense, had not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half asleep and all love, Wei Wuxian pressed his mouth to Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. He lingered, thinking about how nice it would be to have this every night, Lan Zhan in his bed, within arm\u2019s reach. Even if Wei Wuxian woke up in the middle of the night as he so often did, gasping, brain on fire, he\u2019d be opening his eyes to Lan Zhan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That would be worth it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kissed Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder one more time and settled in to sleep. This time, he didn't dream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m a little drunk and a lot lonely, so here goes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was underwater.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deep at the bottom of a lake. Was it the Aqua Demon? Had it caught him after all, dragged him down, down, down into the icy black depths of Biling Lake? Had everything since then been a dream? A nightmare?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWei Ying.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Light pierced the water. Wei Wuxian opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was... not at the bottom of a lake. He squinted at his surroundings, mind all honey-drip slow from sleep. It wasn\u2019t afternoon yet. Midmorning, maybe? Silk-screen windows grayish with overcast sunlight. This was\u2014the Library Pavilion. Right. Right, he\u2019d woken to an empty bed this morning, skull panging with a rare hangover. Lan Zhan had already left for some meeting or another, but he\u2019d let Wei Wuxian a tray of breakfast. Wei Wuxian had eaten alone and then wandered over here to search for research material on ancient talismans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was sitting in the central chamber of the library, where a lifetime ago he\u2019d spent hours and hours copying the Lan Sect Principles and trying not to look at the Second Jade of Lan more than fifty times per hour. The walls were lined with shelves and hanging scrolls, and Wei Wuxian was bent over one of the low desks, a pile of books at his elbow. <em> Collection of Tranquility. Collection for the Symmetry and Balance of the Senses. Collection of the Dreaming Mind. </em> He\u2019d apparently been using <em> Collection for the Taming of Beasts </em> as a pillow. Lan Zhan was leaning over him, one hand hovering near Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder as if in preparation to nudge him awake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sat upright, wincing. \u201cDid I fall asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pouted. \u201cWhy\u2019d you wake me up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looked uncomfortable,\u201d said Lan Zhan. He was glorious in the pale light. Luminous, like his soul was glowing through his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCarry me back to the Jingshi and put me to bed, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gave him an unimpressed look. Then, \u201cYou were... saying things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah. \u201cYeah, I do that sometimes,\u201d Wei Wuxian said carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, though. Most of the time I don\u2019t remember whatever I dreamed about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hand was still right there, and Wei Wuxian was still sleepy and soft, so he grabbed it and put it on top of his own head, guiding Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers into his loose, sun-warmed hair. He let his eyes flutter shut again, pressing up into the touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels good,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cFeels good, Lan Zhan ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He let go of Lan Zhan\u2019s wrist, but Lan Zhan didn\u2019t stop petting him. He carded his fingers through Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, careful not to tug at any of the little tangles. Wei Wuxian wanted Lan Zhan to do this all the time. He wanted to do this in bed, he wanted to curl up in bed with Lan Zhan and have his hair petted, he wanted to push his own hands into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair and pull him close and kiss his forehead and his cheekbones and his pretty mouth. He wanted to sleep with him again and not wake up alone. Or\u2014not care about waking up alone, because they slept together every night and not just when Wei Wuxian was drunk and clingy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d Lan Zhan asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, a lot of things,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, glancing over his messy notes. \u201cAt first I was looking for general information about ancient talisman work, like the invention and development of the very first talismans. I was expecting it to be similar to what we use today, you know, some type of writing surface and cinnabar, or blood if you\u2019re a terrifying demon man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a demon,\u201d said Lan Zhan, just like Wei Wuxian knew he would.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrifying, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan made a considering face. \u201cTo others. When you want to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019ve still got it,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. Lan Zhan\u2019s hand had paused in his hair, so Wei Wuxian butted up into it like a cat, and Lan Zhan started petting him again. \u201cAnyway, I expected the use of talismans to correspond with record-keeping, like how before people wrote on paper and wood they wrote on silk or animal skin or strips of bamboo. But I found this passage in\u2014you\u2019ll like this, it\u2019s not even a history book, it\u2019s a book of love poetry from the venerated Gao Li to his cultivation partner\u2014here, in <em> Thoughts on Parting with an Old Friend at Yangzhou, </em>listen to this: \u2018By the bamboo thicket in a silver pool left by a summer storm, here I watch my beloved open and with phoenix-pinfeathers color the water\u2026 blah blah\u2026 Red carp turns to watery flame. When the white moon rises over the mountains of Chu, with Xuewu and a shiver of light we leave Danyang behind.\u2019\u201d Wei Wuxian drummed his fingers on the desk, excited all over again. \u201cIt\u2019s blood, the whole \u2018phoenix pinfeathers\u2019 thing. Gao Li\u2019s cultivation partner was spilling her own blood into this pool of water, but not like a regular blood spell, right? Because then she drops her dagger Xuewu into the water and somehow that becomes the talisman\u2014a portal talisman, they used it to leave the city of Danyang, there\u2019s a whole verse about it later on. I\u2019m trying to figure it out. How do you get any sort of accuracy if you\u2019re just dropping a blank talisman into a pool of bloody water? I\u2019m assuming she spelled the blood first and the water acted as some sort of activation mechanism, but\u2026.\u201d He squinted down at his notes. \u201cObviously there\u2019s the yin energy of the standing water and the yang of the metal blade, but that\u2019s not inherently powerful enough to transport two people, and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s writing spells on the blade itself\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you finished the book of poetry?\u201d Lan Zhan asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighed. \u201cThe next hundred verses are just Gao Li talking about how great it is to make love on a blanket of peach petals and at the top of a mountain and on the banks of the Huai River and so on and so forth. I got bored.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be a first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, me not liking porn? It\u2019s not porn, Lan Zhan, it\u2019s only sexy for poetry nerds like you,\" said Wei Wuxian, waving a hand. Then, \"Wait. <em>Wait</em>, don\u2019t tell me you read stuff like this as a teenager?\u201d Lan Zhan was silent, and Wei Wuxian cackled with laughter. \u201cLan Wangji, you harlot, no wonder you spent so much time in the library! And here I was thinking you\u2019d never had an impure thought in your life!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was certainly an assumption,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter cut off. He blinked, a sudden flush rising under his collar. \u201cWell, I\u2026 I guess so,\u201d he said, and quickly went back to his notes. As it turned out, the concept of \u2018Lan Zhan with impure thoughts\u2019 was something he needed to <em> not </em> think about while Lan Zhan had a hand in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stayed there and petted him for a little while longer, yellow sunlight sliding across the floor. Then he had to go meet with the visiting leader of a minor clan to the south, but before he left he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight for dinner.\u201d Wei Wuxian thought that was one of his most favorite things he\u2019d ever heard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019d love to say I\u2019ve never forgotten anything about you, any moment with you, but we both know that would be a lie. I\u2019ve always had a bad memory. Dying made it worse. Do you know what fucks with me the most, Lan Zhan? I\u2019ll never have a new memory of shijie. How is it that someone I loved infinitely can become finite just like that? It\u2019s been thirteen years for Jiang Cheng and Jin Ling, of course not to say that it ever gets less painful, but they\u2019ve had thirteen years of living without her and to me she was just here. She was just here, where did she go? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I didn\u2019t attend my sister\u2019s wedding or her funeral. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, I don\u2019t want to forget anything about you ever again. I won\u2019t. I told you once to let me go; I take it back. Keep me around for a long time, okay? I\u2019m writing this on the road to Gusu and whenever I think about seeing you again I can\u2019t breathe, I really can\u2019t. This big ocean tide swells inside me and I can\u2019t breathe around it, I\u2019m honestly a little worried about my ribs cracking. Ahh! Lan Zhan! Lan Zhan, I like writing your name, have you noticed it\u2019s always so pretty in the letters I send you even when the rest of my handwriting is a mess? To become a great calligrapher you have to wholly understand and evoke and give yourself over to the \u2018spirit\u2019 of each character; that\u2019s when writing becomes art. When you know something past the bones to the soul and love it with every movement, every breath, and you can let go and let it guide you and know that what you make will be beautiful. Lan Zhan, my handwriting is absolute shit unless I\u2019m writing your name\u2014then I\u2019m the greatest calligrapher of all. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I can\u2019t breathe again! Fingers crossed I make it to Gusu! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> This won\u2019t happen, but I wish you would kiss me when you see me. I\u2019d definitely perish on the spot, but... what a way to go. Much better than the first time. (I wouldn\u2019t make that joke in front of you. I know you\u2019d hate it, you soft heart.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019re not going to kiss me, I don\u2019t even know if you want to. But I wish you would.

A servant brought dinner at exactly six o\u2019clock, right when he was starting to get hungry. It was funny how quickly he\u2019d adjusted to the Cloud Recesses schedule, all his internal patterns and rhythms shifting around for this new way of life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took off his outer robes and hung them up in the wardrobe beside Lan Zhan\u2019s. Then he sat down at the table and spread out an array of blank talismans, writing with water while he waited for Lan Zhan to get out of his dumb meeting, the Fu characters evaporating almost as quickly as he drew them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, he heard the telltale crunch of shoes on white shells, then shoes crossing the porch. Wei Wuxian grinned to himself, heart skittering like a drop of oil in a hot wok. A moment later the door to the Jingshi slid open to reveal a tall, beloved figure, shadowy white against the purple dusk outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian said brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re home!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan paused in the threshold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s dinner,\u201d Wei Wuxian continued, pushing aside his talismans to clear a space on the table. \u201cAh, ignore the mess, I had this <em> other </em> idea about using bloodwork to manipulate existing energy from the natural world, like pulling from rivers or springs or other places with perpetual motion, or even an entire forest or mountain, so you could access spiritual power even if your own core energy had been depleted. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to do it without harming the source. Or using too much blood. It\u2019s definitely possible! It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right exchange\u2014anyway. Come sit, come eat.\u201d He set about spooning millet into one bowl and boiled gai lan into another. Unlike Wei Wuxian, who liked to mash everything up in one bowl, Lan Zhan preferred to keep each dish separate.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard Lan Zhan moving around the Jingshi, putting Bichen on the sword-stand, removing his fancy hairpiece, hanging up his outermost robe. By the time he joined Wei Wuxian at the table, he was no longer His Excellency; he was Wei Wuxian\u2019s Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home in time for dinner. I missed you today,\u201d Wei Wuxian continued, pouring two cups of water. \u201cTomorrow you should tell all the sect leaders to shove it and hang out with me instead. When was the last time we visited your bunnies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian put down the teapot and glanced up. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes were lowered. His expression was... it took Wei Wuxian a few moments to parse it, because it wasn\u2019t one he\u2019d seen very often, plus Lan Zhan was hiding it on purpose. But therein lay the answer: usually Lan Zhan\u2019s face was blank because he wasn\u2019t a physically expressive person; right now it was blank because he felt vulnerable, flung-open, and was trying to regain some semblance of control. So that sparked a second question: why did he feel vulnerable?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or\u2014shy? Both?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I know you can\u2019t <em> actually </em> tell the sect leaders to shove it,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, deciding the best course of action was to give Lan Zhan the space to collect himself. \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s time for Zewu-jun to come out of seclusion and take up the mantle. I\u2019m tired of sharing you with every bottom-feeder in the cultivation world.\u201d He dumped chili oil over his gai lan. \u201cYao-zongzhu and Ouyang-zongzhu in particular do not deserve to look at your pretty face all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gave Wei Wuxian a small, soft smile. \u201cThank you for dinner. I am glad to be home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAi,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, flustered by the one-two punch of devastating smile and dreadful Lan sincerity. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, I didn\u2019t cook it! What\u2019re you trying to give me a heart attack for, ah? Thanking me out of the blue like that? No, absolutely not. Be quiet and eat your vegetables, you terrible, terrible man. Silence during meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d said Lan Zhan. The shyness was replaced by amusement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm!\u201d said Wei Wuxian, and made a crinkly-nosed face at him, then busied himself with his own dinner. He lasted a very impressive two minutes before launching into a more detailed explanation of the talismans he\u2019d been tinkering with all day, because 95% of the time all it took to solve a problem was relaying it to Lan Zhan. By the time they\u2019d finished eating and had moved into the tea-and-Emperor\u2019s-Smile portion of the evening, he\u2019d come up with at least three new ideas to experiment with come morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After <em> that, </em> Lan Zhan practiced the guqin and Wei Wuxian harmonized with him, the two of them transitioning seamlessly from one song to the next. Wei Wuxian loved the music they made together, Chenqing\u2019s high, leaping notes layered over the low, steady vibrations of the guqin. He loved how Lan Zhan\u2019s gaze flickered up to meet his every couple minutes. Wei Wuxian always smiled around the next note, and Lan Zhan always smiled back, even if it was just with his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was such a good evening. This was such a good life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t have the best track record with \u2018good,\u2019 but that was his past lifetime. In this one, he was hoping bright things stayed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night Wei Wuxian woke to darkness, and for once he didn\u2019t know why. It was unsettling enough that he got out of bed and padded silently over to the doorway of the second room where Lan Zhan slept, partly to make sure he was okay and partly because watching Lan Zhan breathe always calmed him down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he heard a sharp intake of breath and realized what had woken him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian was at Lan Zhan\u2019s bedside in an instant. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, shaking Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLan Zhan. Lan Wangji. Wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knew Lan Zhan was awake when his body went stiff all over, a statue wrapped in blankets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them moved for a long time, just breathing. Then Lan Zhan opened his eyes. \u201c...Wei Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan reached for him. His hand slid up Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm to his shoulder, pulling him down and in, tactile and graceless like he never was in daylight. Wei Wuxian ended up with his cheek pressed to Lan Zhan\u2019s chest, right over his war-drum heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, not war-drum; not zhangu. Yaogu, a dancing drum. Nothing about Lan Zhan was war. Everything about him was music.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a little awkward: Lan Zhan on his back, Wei Wuxian bent over him, still half-sitting, one hand braced on the mattress by Lan Zhan\u2019s hip. This would be easier if he just got up on the bed. If he tucked himself into Lan Zhan\u2019s warm side, curled around him like a fox, made one shape of their two bodies. There were usually reasons not to do that, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything more important than Lan Zhan being scared and sad, so Wei Wuxian just went for it. He clambered up onto the bed and inserted himself in the narrow space between Lan Zhan and the window, wriggling under the blankets and throwing an arm around Lan Zhan's waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan ran a shaking hand through Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered, nudging into the touch. He cuddled even closer, resting his cheek on Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, you\u2019re alright.\u201d Lan Zhan was silent. Wei Wuxian tried to remember the things shijie had whispered to him when they were children and Wei Wuxian had woken up screaming on a regular basis. \u201cIt was just a nightmare. Whatever you saw, it\u2019s not real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was,\u201d said Lan Zhan in a hollowed-out voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019d dreamt of the Cloud Recesses burning. \u201cWell, it\u2019s over now,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmured, reaching up to trail his fingers down the side of Lan Zhan\u2019s face. \u201cIt happened and you survived it and it\u2019s over now, and you\u2019re here with me and everything\u2019s alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turned his head to look at Wei Wuxian. Their faces were suddenly very close together, noses almost brushing. Wei Wuxian wanted to kiss him. If they\u2019d been\u2014if they\u2019d been something else, this was where he\u2019d kiss Lan Zhan. This was where he\u2019d find Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth in the darkness and kiss him, warm and lingering; this was where he\u2019d slide a hand into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair and put love in all the places the fear was. They were so close. He could feel Lan Zhan\u2019s quiet exhales on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you scared of, ah?\u201d he whispered. \u201cTell me so I can beat it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That got him a slightly less quiet exhale. So practically a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding! I\u2019m the Yiling Laozu. Demons quiver at my feet. When I cross a river, it runs red. One time I slaughtered a whole village just to suck the marrow out of everyone\u2019s bones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI eat babies, possibly? Conflicting accounts on that one. Definitely no consensus as to whether I eat them raw or turn them into a nice stew. What else.... I\u2019ve bedded both the Xiangliu and the Yeren. Don\u2019t ask me about the physical logistics of that, I really couldn\u2019t tell you. I have caused four separate droughts and either one or three famines depending on who you ask. I roam the countryside wreaking havoc just for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one is true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whined. \u201cIt\u2019s not true at all, I was very well-behaved those ten months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying does not behave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pouted at him in the dark. \u201cWell, that\u2019s why you like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do. I know you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lan Zhan whispered, and it dropped into Wei Wuxian\u2019s belly like a coin into a deep pool, winking gold all the way down. He barely managed not to shiver. \u201cI like Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you too,\u201d he said. It was too much, saying that kind of thing with Lan Zhan\u2019s steady, dark gaze on him, so he squirmed around until Lan Zhan\u2019s arm was around him and his face was hidden in the crook of Lan Zhan\u2019s neck. He sighed into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair, feeling more comfortable than he had in\u2014he didn\u2019t know how long. When was the last time he\u2019d fully relaxed like this, with even the most paranoid, animal parts of his brain settling down, hackles dropped? Definitely before he\u2019d died. Before defecting. Before the Burial Mounds. Before the fall of Lotus Pier, before pulling a dark sword from a fake Xuanwu\u2019s shell, before leaving for Qishan, before getting kicked out of the Cloud Recesses. Was it at the Cloud Recesses? Before? He laid a hand on Lan Zhan\u2019s chest, fingers curled loosely over his heart. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cYour heartbeat\u2019s going so fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan was silent above him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pressed even closer. \u201cPoor Lan Zhan. No more nightmares, okay? Does this help?\u201d A thought occurred and he snorted a little, laughing soundlessly into Lan Zhan\u2019s neck. \u201cShould I just sleep with you every night? Is that what it\u2019ll take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, realizing as he said it that he wasn\u2019t. He stopped laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou...,\u201d Lan Zhan trailed off. \u201cThat is not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A long pause. Wei Wuxian felt his own heartbeat trip and quicken. He was about two seconds from pretending like he\u2019d been joking after all when Lan Zhan said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fingers twitched on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hip. \u201cYes,\u201d he said again, and there was an odd note in his voice; melancholy, or resigned. \u201cIf Wei Ying wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying wants,\u201d Wei Wuxian said softly. \u201cDoes Lan Zhan want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That got him an even longer pause. Wei Wuxian lay there, face hidden, breathing in the woodsmoke scent of Lan Zhan\u2019s hair and the soap-smell of his skin, and thought about kissing him, kissing him and being kissed by him. Thought about Lan Zhan rolling over and climbing on top of him, his hair a black curtain around their faces, his weight so warm and perfect, pressing Wei Wuxian into the mattress, holding him down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I will,\u201d Wei Wuxian said immediately, lips brushing Lan Zhan\u2019s neck as he spoke. \u201cI will, I\u2019ll sleep here every night. Do you understand? If Lan Zhan wants me to, I will. If Lan Zhan wants me in his bed, that\u2019s where I am. If Lan Zhan wants me gone, then I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d Lan Zhan said, and turned over, though he didn\u2019t climb on top of Wei Wuxian, just faced him in the dark. He wrapped his other arm around Wei Wuxian and gathered him to his chest, his lips at Wei Wuxian\u2019s hairline. \u201cNo, never. Never gone. Always here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squeezed his eyes shut. He had never been held like this. He had never been held like this. \u201cThen I\u2019m always here, my Lan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t say anything. He just nodded and pulled Wei Wuxian even closer, heart beating like water on rock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m a little drunk and a lot lonely, so here goes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s really good that you\u2019ll never read this because I know it would make you sad, but I knew I was going to die for a long time before it actually happened. I\u2019m not dumb, Lan Zhan, I knew I couldn\u2019t just fuck off to the Burial Mounds and live there forever in peace; not with the Wens as hunted as they were or me as dangerous as I was. I was just prolonging the inevitable, buying us one day at a time. And here\u2019s the strange part: so many of those days were good. Objectively it was the worst time in my life; I was going crazy, I could feel the darkness eating away at me like flames devouring paper, the edges of my soul turning black as soot and curling. I missed shijie and you and even Jiang Cheng and a lot of other things, and in the beginning we were all starving and we hadn't figured out that we could go into Yiling for supplies; we thought the moment we stepped foot outside the wards we\u2019d be dead, and there weren\u2019t any animals yet; those came later. One day Madam Wen told me to call her wai po and the next day she said if it came down to it and we were really gonna starve, I should take A-Yuan and run. She said Wen Qing wouldn\u2019t leave Wen Ning and the rest of them would face their fate together, but A-Yuan had to live, and his best chance at survival was with me. And I said okay but later that night I was thinking about it and I thought \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s true I would kill for him but it\u2019s not true I\u2019ll survive.\u2019 And then I thought \u2018Okay, how about this. I\u2019ll get him to Gusu. All I have to do is get him to Gusu and send a message to Lan Zhan. That\u2019s his real best chance at survival.\u2019 And I imagined him in a little set of white robes with a white ribbon on his head and I think that was the last time I ever felt at peace. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Anyway I knew I was dead meat. I didn\u2019t think about it much because there was always stuff to do, and of course it\u2019s no use thinking about things like that and getting all maudlin, not when there\u2019s so many turnips to pick! Do you know Lan Zhan, when Jiang Cheng came to visit that one time he saw everyone picking the turnips and potatoes and so on, and he said \u2018How can you eat food grown in this soil? Isn\u2019t it poisonous?\u2019 and the funny thing is that it wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t poisonous. It was just turnips. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> So objectively it was the worst time in my life, and I\u2019ll admit at the beginning I was bitter about everything I wasn\u2019t gonna become. I don\u2019t regret anything with the Wens except for how it ended; it\u2019s just I always had my life planned out. I would be second in command to Jiang Cheng just like my father was to Jiang Fengmian. I was going to live out my days in Yunmeng, in Lotus Pier, and I\u2019d spend my free time night hunting and inventing things and visiting shijie in Lanling and maybe one day taking on students, I know your uncle would spit blood if he ever heard me say that but I did want to be a teacher. And that would be my life and it would be familiar and sunlit and good. I know a lot of people think I\u2019m very arrogant and it\u2019s true that I can be, but I never cared about being \u2018A Great or Notorious Something,\u2019 I just wanted to be a Wei Wuxian whose name speaks for itself. Well anyway, then Jiang Cheng lost his core, so that was that. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> In the first days of the Burial Mounds I did have some thoughts like \u2018I can never return, this is it, this is my life now,\u2019 but you know me Lan Zhan, once I\u2019ve made a decision I\u2019ve made it, and I won\u2019t go back on my word, and besides Wen Ning needed help and the idea of slinking back to Jinlintai and kowtowing to Jin Guangshan made me sick. Ah.... All this to say that in the beginning I didn\u2019t think it would be good; it was simply the most bearable choice. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> But Lan Zhan, it was good. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Not all the time. Of course there were terrible days, especially toward the end. But there were so many good days. I wish you could have seen it. We had a lotus pond. They were my family. When we first got to that place it was silent all the time, dead air, flat sky, no wind in the dead trees; only ghosts could dwell there. Maybe that\u2019s why it let us stay. Maybe it could tell we were on the verge of belonging, just give it a few months. So it was silent, but on the morning of the sixtieth day I woke up crying. Uncle Four came barrelling into my Demon-Subdue Palace and he was crying too, and I realized: that odd noise outside was a nightingale. There were so many songbirds, Lan Zhan. And cicadas, and little animals scuttling around in the dead leaves, and one time a fawn walked right up to our fire during dinner! I don\u2019t know where it came from but I guess it hadn\u2019t seen humans before; it wasn\u2019t scared at all. And we didn\u2019t eat it even though we were low on food that night, because how funny is that! It just walked right up like it was angling for a meal! Ah, we laughed all night. We grew turnips and lotuses. They were my family. Living there, I began to dream about this and that. I dreamed about having a farm, like a real farm in a valley between two faraway mountains, with pigs and chickens and a fat little donkey. I dreamed about waking up at the crack of dawn (ha!) and working in the fields all day and coming home hungry and eating a hot meal, then reading a bit, then going to bed. I thought about the stuffy sect leaders who look down on non-cultivators, who laugh at the cosmic insignificance of the common people, how they live and die so quietly without doing anything worth recording in the annals of history. I thought about how the unknown farmer who grew the rice in Jin Guangshan\u2019s bowl had already contributed more to this world than Jin Guangshan ever could. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I thought \u2018I\u2019m not going to make it out of this, but if I did, that would be a good life.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sometimes you were there, in my dreams. Most of the time you weren\u2019t. You see, at the very end all I wanted was to be left alone and forgotten, and I couldn\u2019t do that to you. Not to you, Lan Zhan. You were the only one of those fuckers worth remembering. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next week passed quietly. At first Wei Wuxian slept in Lan Zhan\u2019s bed, but then he insisted on both of them switching back to the bed in the main room, so he could still have the pleasure of waking to see Lan Zhan working at the table. On the first night, they started off on their separate sides of the bed and lasted almost until dawn before curling into each other, fingers intertwined on Lan Zhan\u2019s stomach. On the second night, they started off with their arms touching. By the fifth night, Lan Zhan went to bed at nine with Wei Wuxian cuddled right up to his side, though of course Wei Wuxian planned on staying awake for a few more hours because he had reading to do and he wasn\u2019t one hundred years old or a Lan. The sixth and seventh nights were the same.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of the eighth day, Wei Wuxian returned from his daily walk to find Lan Zhan and Sizhui standing on the porch of the Jingshi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey sweetheart, hey kiddo,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, hopping up onto the porch and immediately reaching for Lan Zhan\u2019s hand, lacing their fingers together. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sizhui\u2019s eyes sparkled as he glanced between Wei Wuxian and Lan Zhan, but he didn\u2019t say anything, bless his precious little heart. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t known he was going to call Lan Zhan \u2018sweetheart\u2019 before it came out of his mouth, and now he was trying very hard not to freak out and/or check Lan Zhan\u2019s reaction. \u201cHello, Wei-qianbei,\u201d said Sizhui. \u201cWe received a message this morning from the village of Guoyang to the south. They\u2019ve been dealing with a vengeful ghost for a while now, and recently the attacks have grown more frequent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the ghost of a woman who drowned last spring,\u201d said Lan Zhan. His voice sounded normal, so Wei Wuxian dared to take a quick peek at him. His expression was placid. His ears were bright red. \u201cShe keeps attempting to lure village children into the river where she drowned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t succeeded yet,\u201d said Sizhui. \u201cOr\u2014she has, but the children were always rescued. There haven\u2019t been any deaths. But up until a month ago she\u2019d only attacked five children total, and now there have been eleven attacks in the past two weeks alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill no deaths?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Just a lot of near-drownings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo the attacks have grown more frequent, but not more severe.\u201d Wei Wuxian leaned into Lan Zhan\u2019s side. \u201cHmmm. Question. Why do these kids keep playing near the haunted death river?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cThe ghost cannot leave the river, but somehow she is able to control the children from over a mile away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow <em> that</em>,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, \u201cis interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun, did you call me here because you want me and the others to take the case?\u201d asked Sizhui.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shook his head. \u201cI will be taking it,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong with Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are?\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cWe are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beamed up at him. \u201c<em>Yeah </em>we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Sizhui, Lan Zhan said, \u201cI do not anticipate it will take more than three days. If a problem arises, send a butterfly. We will return at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Hanguang-jun,\u201d said Sizhui. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be fine here! You and Wei-qianbei just focus on\u2014um, the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squinted at him. Sizhui smiled innocently back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The village of Guoyang was half a day\u2019s journey on foot. They packed qiankun bags with three days\u2019 worth of clothing and set off at once, bidding farewell to Sizhui at the main gates. With Wei Wuxian perched atop Little Apple and Lan Zhan walking alongside, holding onto her bridle, they made their way down the mountain and into the valley, heading due south. As the hours passed, the mountains flattened out into hills like folds of green cloth, patched with yellow where the first frosts of winter had already started killing the grass. Wei Wuxian played Chenqing as they went, any and every song he could think of plus some he invented on the spot. He was serious about composing \u201cOde to a Lotus Pond High in the Clouds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d also been experimenting with a melody he currently thought of as \u201cHands.\u201d That one wasn\u2019t ready to be heard, though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Guoyang was a small village on the Gusu side of the border between Gusu and Yueling, nestled in the bend of the Yingwu River. It traded mainly in pottery made of river clay; all the shops along the main street had wide-bellied clay pots sitting outside their doors like little sentinels, painted exquisitely with river scenes and lines of poetry. Wei Wuxian and Lan Zhan stopped at the first inn they found. Lan Zhan paid for their room while Wei Wuxian dragged Little Apple out to the stables, hand-feeding her some hay off the floor of her stall. He patted her velvety soft nose, scratched behind her big ears, and told her, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning. Try not to get yourself kicked out before then, you horrible worm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With one last ear-skritch, he went back to the inn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had gotten them a room on the second floor with a window overlooking the street, which at this hour was dark but for a few lanterns, a black river speckled with golden fish. He was bent over the hearth fire on its low stone platform by the bed when Wei Wuxian entered. Candles were already burning low around the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I call for a bath?\u201d Lan Zhan asked, straightening up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m too tired,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. He padded over to the wardrobe in his sock feet, unwinding his wrist wraps. \u201cSorry, I can sleep on the floor if you don\u2019t wanna share a bed with me all grimy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan joined him at the wardrobe, stepping right into Wei Wuxian\u2019s personal space. He leaned in and Wei Wuxian thought hysterically <em> \u2018he\u2019s going to fucking kiss me\u2019 </em> and then Lan Zhan\u2026 sniffed him. \u201cNot grimy,\u201d he decided.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is so great,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. Lan Zhan moved away, the picture of calm, and began shaking out the bedsheets to check for mice. Wei Wuxian cleared his throat. \u201cAh, I can\u2019t help but feel a little bad for Sizhui and Wen Ning, swiping their hunt. Seems like they make a pretty good team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are both skilled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially Sizhui, considering he\u2019s so young. I know you know this, but he\u2019s such a bright kid. He\u2019s wonderful.\u201d He gave Lan Zhan a significant look. \u201cYour son takes after you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur son,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur son,\u201d Lan Zhan said, very serious. \u201cNot mine. Ours. Before he came to me, he was Wei Ying\u2019s. He is alive because of Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, abruptly on the verge of tears. <em> Our son. Our son. </em> \u201cNo, he\u2019s alive because of you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were the one who found him, you were the one who took him back to the Cloud Recesses and hid him there, you were the one who raised him for <em> thirteen years</em>, I never\u2014I never thanked you for that, I can\u2019t believe you did that, I mean\u2014I can, of course I can, you\u2019re <em> you</em>, but\u2014,\u201d he turned away, pressing a hand over his mouth. \u201cLan Zhan. I managed not to kill the kid for a year. That\u2019s not....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou forget that I visited you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I try not to fucking think about it,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. Lan Zhan\u2019s expression went blank, hurt. \u201c<em>No</em>, no, not because of you, just\u2014fuck, Lan Zhan, I was losing my mind. I knew the cultivation world wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. I knew it was just a matter of time. And the look on your face that day. You were horrified.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot horrified,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cTerrified.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowned. \u201cOkay...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan took a step closer. \u201cI failed to communicate this, back then,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not horrified by you. I was terrified for you. Wei Ying, to me... you were never the Yiling Laozu. You were always Wei Ying. You were brilliant and kind. You brought life to the Burial Mounds. Your lotus flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2014the lotus pond was after you visited, how did you...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw the ruins of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right. \u201cOkay, but I didn\u2019t do any of that alone, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNor did I raise Sizhui alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-jun helped?\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cOther people in your sect? Gods, surely not just your uncle, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy uncle. My brother. You.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stopped breathing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would not have my son grow up as I did,\u201d said Lan Zhan. His body was ringing with tension, all his strings pulled taut. He was clearly struggling with some internal barrier, to talk like this. \u201cBored. Lonely. Seeing the world only in black and white. I would not have him spend his days in isolation, waiting for someone to\u2014to throw open the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is your son,\u201d Lan Zhan said again. \u201cWei Ying. There was no body. You left behind no possessions. That child was\u2014,\u201d he broke off, closing his eyes and taking a deep, steadying breath. When he spoke again, his voice was fractured like Wei Wuxian had never heard it before. \u201cHe talked about you. The fever affected his memories, but when he was still small.... He talked about you. He called you \u2018Xian-gege.\u2019 He adored you. He was someone else who....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last thread of Wei Wuxian\u2019s self-control snapped, just like that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He crossed the room in two strides, reeled Lan Zhan in by the collar of his robes, and kissed him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d imagined this a thousand times, both before he died and after, but what he never imagined was this: Lan Zhan freezing instantly and melting just as quick, catching Wei Wuxian by the waist, mouth opening on a sharp, stuttering breath; his version of a sob. The kiss was hard and hot and lasted only a few seconds before Wei Wuxian was wrenching away, gasping. His pulse crashed in his ears like whitewater. His lips already felt bruised. He and Lan Zhan were still close enough to share breaths, Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands twisted in the white silk of Lan Zhan\u2019s robes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stared at each other, equally stunned. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes were so wide and dark, flickering across Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. His lips were parted in shock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cL-Lan Zhan,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s throat moved when he swallowed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, as if expecting Wei Wuxian to stop him at any moment, Lan Zhan let go of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips. He reached up to tuck a tendril of hair behind Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear. His hands were shaking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, kiss me. You want to, right? You look like you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gave the tiniest nod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do it,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cDo it, I want you to do it, I want you to kiss me. Lan Zhan, kiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another nod. Lan Zhan took Wei Wuxian\u2019s face in his hands and leaned in. He paused at the last possible moment, their lips almost touching, and took a breath like he was about to slip slowly underwater; not the deep inhale before a plunge but a quiet, measured reassurance. Then he pressed forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This kiss, like the first one, was brief. Wei Wuxian had just enough time to think <em> \u2018it\u2019s Lan Zhan kissing me\u2019 </em>before it ended, but Lan Zhan swayed in again almost immediately, firmer this time. Wei Wuxian let go of his collar only to wrap his hands around Lan Zhan\u2019s wrists, holding them in place, and he thought about how he\u2019d never done this before, because in his first life he had died unkissed. For some reason that, instead of literally anything else, made his eyes prick with sudden tears. He might have stayed dead. Nie Huaisang and Mo Xuanyu might\u2019ve easily snatched some other soul out of hell or wherever he\u2019d been. Wei Wuxian might have just died, forever, without ever knowing what it felt like to kiss Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was abruptly tired of himself. They parted again, a quiet catching sound, and Wei Wuxian whispered, \u201cI like you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan went still. His nose was still brushing Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek. His hands were so warm on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, one thumb stroking the soft skin in front of his ear. People didn\u2019t touch Wei Wuxian like this. Gently, with so much care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, and kissed him again. They were so close, he barely had to move at all. He kissed Lan Zhan on the mouth and lingered there, letting their lips brush as he spoke. \u201cLan Zhan is so good, he\u2019s really my favorite. I love sleeping with him. I love doing anything with him. If he allowed it, I\u2019d stay at his side forever, and I\u2019d sleep with him every night and wander around with him every day, and I\u2019d be so happy, because he makes me happy always, my Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan choked out. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d He tangled his fingers in Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair and pressed their foreheads together. His breaths were quick and harsh on Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips. \u201cYou are always allowed,\u201d he said. \"I told you. Always.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, overcome. \u201cOh, good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of that. I want all of that, with Wei Ying. Every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Yes, </em> Wei Wuxian thought, <em> oh gods, yes, </em>but... his wild grin faded, reality seeping in. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cTo most of the cultivation world, I\u2019m still the Yiling Laozu. It\u2019s more acceptable if we\u2019re simply old friends, but if\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Lan Zhan said firmly. \u201cI do not care what those people think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the Chief Cultivator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Brother will emerge from seclusion soon. He will take over as Chief Cultivator. It has already been decided.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014wait, <em> what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHate that job,\u201d Lan Zhan said, leaning back a little to meet Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes. His cheeks were glowing, his ears pink; he\u2019d never been more lovely. \u201cHate dealing with fools all day. I want to night hunt with Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying is also a fool,\u201d Wei Wuxian pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. Good fool. Not like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian burst out laughing, then wrapped his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s neck and drew him into a messy, lopsided kiss that quickly became a messy, very good kiss, Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth opening under his own. They kissed like that for a long time, holding each other in the center of the room. At some point Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers found the ribbon in Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, untying it and letting it drop to the floor in a rare display of carelessness; he seemed unwilling to let go of Wei Wuxian even for the time it would take to go put the ribbon on the table. Wei Wuxian tried to do the same, but he couldn\u2019t actually get rid of Lan Zhan\u2019s complicated hairpiece without looking, so he broke the kiss and stood on his tip-toes, frowning a little in concentration as he carefully removed the big silver ornament, then all the pins holding Lan Zhan\u2019s bun in place. He didn\u2019t actually want to drop the hairpiece on the floor, so he made to slip out of Lan Zhan\u2019s arms\u2014only for Lan Zhan to catch his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna\u2014,\u201d Wei Wuxian started, then saw the look in Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes, nervous and determined, and realized what he was after. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, a low, punched-out sound. Oh, gods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He handed the hairpiece to Lan Zhan and stood in front of him, close enough that if he leaned forward a couple inches they\u2019d be kissing again. Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth was red in the low candlelight. His hair was loose and undecorated, his eyes a warm, burnished gold. He was so god damn beautiful. How was it possible for one person to have the most beautiful heart and soul <em> and </em>face?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmured, and reached around to the back of Lan Zhan\u2019s head, feeling for the small knot in his forehead ribbon. Lan Zhan closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t open them again until Wei Wuxian had untied the ribbon and slipped it out of his hair. Wei Wuxian waited until Lan Zhan was looking at him, then brought the silver filigree to his lips and kissed it, and Lan Zhan swayed as if caught in some invisible wake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian went to put the hairpiece and the forehead ribbon on the table beside the bed, folding the ribbon neatly. Then, instead of returning to Lan Zhan, he sat down on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he said to Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinked twice. He approached the bed slowly, but not cautiously. He sat down beside Wei Wuxian, and unlike the last time they\u2019d been in this position, he didn\u2019t leave any space between them. His thigh was warm against Wei Wuxian\u2019s even through what had to be like five thousand layers of robes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shifted to face him, bringing one knee up onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m 99% sure I know the answer to this,\u201d he said, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t matter anyway, it won\u2019t change anything. I\u2019m just curious. Have you done anything like this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just saying you were so famously <em> chivalrous</em>, Hanguang-jun. You could\u2019ve had your pick of girls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s dazed look turned to something that could only be described as incredulous. \u201cWei Ying. I have never wanted a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, Wei Wuxian pretty much knew that. \u201cAnyone else, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI....\u201d He sounded pained. \u201cI did want someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's mouth fell open. \u201c<em>Ah? </em> You did? Lan Zhan, you sly fox. Who was it?\u201d Lan Zhan just stared at him. \u201cNo, c\u2019mon, tell me! What lucky fellow caught the eye of the jadelike Lan Wangji? Did I know him? Also, wait, when was this? After we met? How could I possibly not notice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a very good question,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowned. \u201cLan Zhan. Who was it? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d said Lan Zhan. \u201cI just wanted him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All at once, Wei Wuxian understood. \u201cNo fucking way,\u201d he breathed, feeling like he\u2019d just been whacked upside the head with one of Lan Qiren\u2019s bastinados. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014surely not all the way back <em> then</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I was so annoying. You thought I was so annoying!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Lan Zhan agreed. \u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looked at him. \u201cEvery day the same,\u201d he said, deliberate. \u201cEverything the same. Then, you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath left him in a rush. \u201cLan Zhan, you really....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying. There has never been anyone else for me. There will never be anyone else. We met and I was yours. I was furious about it, I was scared, but I was yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hot flush spread through Wei Wuxian\u2019s belly, warming him like a mouthful of wine. Moonstruck, he reached out and cupped Lan Zhan\u2019s face in his hands. He stroked his thumbs over Lan Zhan\u2019s pretty cheekbones, fingertips on the soft soft skin below his ears, every part of this person star-bright and beautiful, his Hanguang-jun, his waxing moon. His yang. His zhiji. The weight of that settled in Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest like snowfall. His soul.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> There has never been anyone else for me</em>, he thought, for once unable to speak. <em> There will never be anyone else. </em> The blackness of Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes in the candlelight was beautiful. Black like embers, black like a hollow tree. Wei Wuxian had slept in one once, a few months before Jiang Fengmian had found him. He\u2019d been small and starved-skinny and he\u2019d fit. And he\u2019d felt strangely safe there, curled up in a hollow tree in the woods beside a wide fishing river. He remembered wishing he could stay forever. That night he\u2019d dreamt of his limbs turning to roots, his body sinking into the tree, into the rich, rain-wet soil. Where nothing went hungry.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a different kind of hunger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cleared his throat, finding his voice again. \u201cI think I wanted you back then, too,\u201d he said. A confession for a confession. \u201cNot in the exact same way at first, and of course once I figured it out I just ignored it, like, \u2018Well obviously that can\u2019t happen.\u2019 But sometimes....\u201d He winced. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan. It\u2019s hard to say out loud. I already said so much tonight, how is it still hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but I do,\u201d Wei Wuxian insisted. \u201cLan Zhan ah, I took it to the grave once. I\u2019m not doing that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s expression hollowed out. Right, fuck, he hated it when Wei Wuxian spoke casually about his own death. Privately Wei Wuxian thought that he, of all people, had earned the right to talk about that time he was dead for thirteen years. But Lan Zhan hated it, and one time Wei Wuxian had imagined himself in Lan Zhan\u2019s place: he\u2019d imagined Lan Zhan falling off that cliff, Lan Zhan just <em> gone</em>, without even a body to mourn, and he\u2019d nearly started hyperventilating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured, and leaned in to kiss Lan Zhan\u2019s face and nuzzle at his temple, because he could do that now. \u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019m sorry. But Lan Zhan, I wanted your attention, I wanted you to look at me. I thought you were so interesting, even when you were also being\u2014ah\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRigid,\u201d supplied Lan Zhan. \u201cStrict. Depressing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPedantic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slapped him lightly on the chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said \u2018How boring,\u2019 \u2018How ridiculous,\u2019 no matter what I did!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe former was a lie.\u201d He paused. \u201cI stand by the latter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought there\u2019s no lying in the Cloud Recesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t,\u201d Lan Zhan said wryly. \u201cThen, you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAi,\u201d Wei Wuxian whined, and pulled him close. Lan Zhan came easily, pressing his bare forehead to Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck. Wei Wuxian rested his cheek on the side of Lan Zhan\u2019s head and breathed in the familiar scent of his soap and hair oil, almond and orchid. \u201cOf course I wanted you,\u201d he said softly. It was easier to talk like this, when he didn\u2019t actually have to look Lan Zhan in the eye. \u201cOf course I did, how could I not? First you were the only person to ever match me in a fight, then you were so funny and smart and fun to tease, then you were just\u2014perfect. I remember meeting Song Lan and Xiao Xingchen and watching them leave together and thinking, <em> That\u2019s what I want with Lan Zhan.</em>\u201d He heard Lan Zhan\u2019s breath hitch. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually think it was possible, because I was supposed to be Jiang Cheng\u2019s second-in-command and you were always going to do great things, and besides I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever want to leave Gusu. But I thought about it. Just traveling around night hunting with you forever, and everyone we met would know we belonged together.\u201d He sighed, tugging lightly at the ends of Lan Zhan\u2019s hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I had a lot of thoughts like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d said Lan Zhan. He sounded dazed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else did you think about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, a thousand things, each sillier than the last. I wanted to swim in a lotus lake with you. I wanted to show you around Yunmeng... okay, this one\u2019s actually kind of embarrassing, because I really did just want to show you all my favorite places in Yunmeng, but also, ah... if I\u2019d shown you around the riverside markets, there was a good chance some of the young maidens would have flirted with me, and I thought about you getting jealous.\u201d Lan Zhan was silent. Wei Wuxian groaned, feeling his cheeks heat up. \u201cIt was just dumb teenage stuff. I didn\u2019t even think you liked me. Ah, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have been,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lips brushed his collarbones. \u201cI would have been jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thrilled, Wei Wuxian hugged him even closer. \u201cHm! Apparently so!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying wanted that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cI mean, not in a mean way. I didn\u2019t want to make you mad or upset or anything. But, ah, there was this one girl who had a pork bun stall. I don\u2019t remember her name, but she always gave me an extra bun for free. And I thought about taking you there so you\u2019d see her smile at me, and you\u2019d see that she wanted me, so maybe it would make you start wanting me, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI already wanted you,\u201d Lan Zhan pointed out. He moved both hands to Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist, warm even through two layers of robes. Wei Wuxian shuffled closer till his knees were pressed against Lan Zhan\u2019s thigh. It was kind of a weird angle. This would be a lot easier and more comfortable if Wei Wuxian just climbed into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I know that <em> now</em>,\u201d he said. His hands found their way into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair, running through it all the way to the ends, silky between his fingers. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t back then. So I thought if you saw someone else flirting with me, you\u2019d realize I was like, a hot commodity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan huffed in amusement. \u201cYou were the fourth most eligible bachelor in the cultivation world. I was aware.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, and you were the second, weren\u2019t you? Right behind Zewu-jun? I always thought that was ridiculous. You should\u2019ve been number one.\u201d He thought about it. \u201cNo, never mind, you shouldn\u2019t have been on the list at all. You weren\u2019t eligible, you were mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Zhan confirmed. \u201cYours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo strike both of us off the list, then. Who would\u2019ve been second and fourth? Jiang Cheng and\u2014gods, Nie Huaisang?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo people I do not wish to think about right now,\u201d said Lan Zhan, squeezing Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian cackled. \u201cOkay, fair. My <em> point </em> was that the pork bun maiden would\u2019ve flirted with me. And I used to think about you seeing that, and... and I know it wouldn\u2019t have happened like this in real life, but I thought about you, ah. Moving closer. Putting a hand on my shoulder.\u201d He was distantly aware of his voice dropping into something lower, softer. \u201cUm. Leading me out of the market to somewhere quiet, with nobody else around. And I\u2019d be like, \u2018Lan Zhan? What are you doing?\u2019 and you\u2019d just... you\u2019d just, ah....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth opened against Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, a flicker of breath and wet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, hushed. He was quickly losing the ability to concentrate. \u201cYou\u2019d, um. You\u2019d grab me and take me in your arms and just\u2014kiss me, just fucking kiss me. Hard. I... I thought about your hands a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hands?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re so big. And pretty. I wanted them...,\u201d he trailed off into a sigh, tipping his head back, as Lan Zhan began to mouth at his neck, bottom lip catching wetly on his skin. \u201cOh, gods. I wanted them all over me, I wanted you all over me, wanted you to.... to drag me to the nearest inn and take me upstairs and sweep everything off the table, like, a whole tea-set\u2014keep in mind this is a fantasy, I know you\u2019d never destroy a perfectly good tea-set\u2014and take me right there on the table, ah Lan <em>Zhan</em>, I really tried not to think about it because I knew I shouldn\u2019t want you and also I was like, \u2018oh, he\u2019d be horrified if he knew I was thinking about this,\u2019 but sometimes\u2014you know when you\u2019re really close and you can\u2019t control where your mind goes\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan reared back to look at him, wild-eyed, breathing hard. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, strangled. \u201cYou\u2014when you were\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYeah,\u201d </em> said Wei Wuxian, and climbed into his lap. Like this he had a few inches on Lan Zhan, so he pushed his hands into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair and used it to tilt his head back, baring the elegant curve of his throat. Lan Zhan\u2019s lips parted on a shocked breath and Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t fuck around, just kissed him, sliding their open mouths together. He hitched up the skirt of his robes and straddled Lan Zhan properly, thighs spread around his hips. Lan Zhan\u2019s hands fell from his waist to his ass, bolder than Wei Wuxian might have expected, pulling him in till the swell of him was pressed against the flat muscle of Lan Zhan\u2019s lower belly. Wei Wuxian heard himself moaning, rocking into him with tiny, helpless movements. He\u2019d never done this before, but he\u2019d never <em> not </em> known how to move with Lan Zhan, whether they were sparring or fighting back-to-back on a battlefield or playing music together or pouring each other\u2019s drinks, serving each other at mealtimes, sitting quietly in the evenings; Lan Zhan with a book and Wei Wuxian bent over his talismans, all their treasured routines, the tiny brush-strokes that formed each day, mundane and predictable and sacred. They knew each other. Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth was soft even when his kiss wasn\u2019t. He was so easy to get lost in, this most trusted person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Wei Wuxian got lost. The rest of the room, the noises floating up from the street down below, everything fell away until nothing existed but this bed, this man; this man and his hands and the way he kissed, deep and endless, all-consuming. They were kissing and kissing and then the world tilted and Wei Wuxian found himself on his back, Lan Zhan hovering over him with a careful hand under his head so he wouldn\u2019t crack his skull on the bedframe. For a moment they both just gazed at each other, dark-eyed and panting. Lan Zhan\u2019s cheeks were pink; his mouth was kissed a deep red. His hair was messy for perhaps the first time in his entire life. Wei Wuxian did that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was beyond beautiful. There weren\u2019t any words for what he was, gilded edges in the candlelight. He was Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart outside his body. He was a hearth fire. If Jiang Cheng was the flash of a saltpeter bomb and shijie a lantern lighting the way home, Lan Zhan was a hearth fire. Always the brightest, warmest thing in the room, the first place you\u2019d go if you\u2019d been cold for a very long time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiled up at him and said, \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re so good. I like you so much.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite. I love you, I\u2019m really in love with you, I want you forever. Let\u2019s get married, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan, whose eyes had gone very wide somewhere around <em> \u2018love you,\u2019 </em> blinked once. Then he tipped sideways, catching his weight on one elbow. His other hand was still under Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he managed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said again. \u201cLan Zhan, you can\u2019t kiss me like that and not marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Marry you,\u201d said Lan Zhan. He appeared to be malfunctioning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I want you to be my closest most beloved friend and my zhiji and my husband. Three\u2019s a lucky number, you know. It\u2019s very powerful. Right now you\u2019re only two of those things, and that\u2019s no good.\u201d He laughed and a couple tears brimmed over, running down his temples into his hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty good. But three\u2019s still better. Hanguang-jun, Lan Wangji, Lan Zhan, marry me, I wanna be your husband. And cultivation partner.\u201d Lan Zhan was just staring at him, frozen. \u201cOh wait,\u201d Wei Wuxian continued, \u201cwait, damn, that\u2019s four things, four\u2019s no good at all... father of our son. There, that\u2019s five. Lots of important things come in fives.\u201d He sniffled. \u201cHey, my love, are you breathing? You should be doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan unfroze long enough to take a breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, beaming at him. \u201cMy Lan Zhan. Marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201c...Yes,\u201d </em> Lan Zhan said at last. His eyes still hadn\u2019t left Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cYes. Wei Ying. Marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMarry <em> me, </em>I asked first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll marry you. Marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart was all fireflies, he couldn\u2019t believe it wasn\u2019t glowing through his chest. \u201cAlright, I will,\u201d he said, and shoved at Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder, pushing him the rest of the way over and climbing on top of him immediately, kissing his cheek, forehead, coaxing his mouth open, already over the strangeness of pressing his tongue inside. He\u2019d never really understood the appeal of kissing like this, of wanting someone else\u2019s tongue in his mouth, but he got it now. It wasn\u2019t the invasion he\u2019d always thought it would be. It was soft and warm and wet; it was opening up for someone who wanted deep inside him, wanted to taste him and draw out all his breathy little noises, wanted to take him and was starting with his mouth. It was so good, it took Wei Wuxian longer than it should have to notice Lan Zhan was tense beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulled away, worried\u2014then immediately saw what the problem was and tried not to burst out laughing. Flat on his back like this, Lan Zhan was simply too tall for the little wooden bed. Even with his legs bent and no hair ornament, the top of his head was shoved up against the headboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of inn is this,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasped. \u201cAre the people of Guoyang just unnaturally short?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy goodness. Well, get up.\u201d He clambered off Lan Zhan and the bed, kind of surprised when his knees didn\u2019t buckle. Lan Zhan followed him, and something about his expression reminded Wei Wuxian of the time he\u2019d gotten drunk in Yueyang. He\u2019d been so cute and pliant, trailing after Wei Wuxian down the dark, misty streets, big doe eyes fixed on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gathered up the bedding and the padded mat and dumped it all on the floor. He\u2019d seen some extra blankets in the wardrobe earlier, so he fetched those too and added them to the pile, then arranged all the blankets over the mat so it was less of a nest and more of a makeshift bed. Satisfied, he was about to turn around and fling himself at Lan Zhan when two big hands settled on his waist. Lan Zhan stepped up behind him, his front warm and solid at Wei Wuxian\u2019s back. He nosed at Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, kissed his ear and the side of his head. Wei Wuxian leaned back into him, eyes fluttering shut, and after a moment Lan Zhan\u2019s arms wrapped around his waist and his chin came to rest on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. It felt like sinking into a hot bath. Heat spreading through him from his toes to the pit of his belly to the tips of his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispered. He put his own hands on Lan Zhan\u2019s forearms. \u201cLan Zhan ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan made a low, sweet noise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turned his face to the side and kissed what he could reach, which was Lan Zhan\u2019s cheekbone and temple and the corner of his eye. Barely even kisses, just brushing his parted lips over Lan Zhan\u2019s skin, breathing him in. He smelled so good. He was so steady and real, his arms around Wei Wuxian, his heart beating at Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. When Lan Zhan breathed in, Wei Wuxian felt the slow expansion of his chest; when he breathed out, his breath was warm on Wei Wuxian\u2019s collarbones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It occured to Wei Wuxian that he had just proposed, and Lan Zhan had said yes, and they were going to be married, and this person would be his <em> husband</em>, which sounded laughable. He hadn\u2019t realized it at the time, because there was so much else going on, but he\u2019d stopped dreaming about his someday-wedding the moment he\u2019d watched Wen Qing reach inside him and come back with his core cupped in her bloodied hands like a golden bird, illuminating her face with pulses of light. When she\u2019d severed the spiritual vein it had looked so ridiculously like cutting an umbilical cord that Wei Wuxian, delirious with pain and exhaustion, had started laughing. Some part of him had known then that he wouldn\u2019t make it out of the war. His future had been cut abruptly short\u2014but Jiang Cheng\u2019s had been ensured, so that was alright. Some people were meant to survive terrible things, and others were not. Some people became the terrible thing, and those people never survived themselves; there was no exception throughout history.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How strange, having a future again. How funny, having time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How wild, how miraculous, having someone to spend it with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Husband.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a totally normal thing to be. Lots of people were husbands. But as Wei Wuxian turned in Lan Zhan\u2019s arms, finding his mouth and sinking into him again, he thought about how the Yiling Laozu was long dead, so in this second life he\u2019d rather be known for this. Wei Wuxian: semi-rogue cultivator, semi-mad inventor, grower of lotus seeds, flouter of rules, new father to an old son. Wei Wuxian: husband.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was definitely crying again. And also grinning so hard it was sort of impeding the whole \u2018making out with the love of his existence\u2019 thing. Lan Zhan pulled back and Wei Wuxian chased his mouth, kissing him one more time, and then it was his turn to be chased and kissed, on his mouth and the hollow of his cheek. Then they were just gazing at each other, Wei Wuxian in the circle of Lan Zhan\u2019s arms. His vision was hazy with tears. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, and he was going to follow it with something like \u2018you\u2019re the best\u2019 or \u2018I like you so much,\u2019 but there were too many options, so he just wrapped his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s middle and hugged him. Lan Zhan hugged him back so hard Wei Wuxian was lifted off the floor a little, their bodies one curve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Lan Zhan murmured into his hair. \u201cLove you, love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cTake me to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no getting around the awkwardness of lowering themselves to the floor and crawling onto the blankets. Wei Wuxian giggled and laid on his back, spreading his legs for Lan Zhan to settle between, reaching up to wind his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s neck. Lan Zhan looked so different with his forehead bare, somehow more naked than he would have if he\u2019d taken all his clothes off but kept the ribbon. Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t resist leaning up to kiss his forehead right where the filigree always sat, then his cheek, then Lan Zhan was pressing him into the blankets and drawing him into a kiss that felt like the first time he\u2019d ever shot a kite right out of the endless blue sky, his arrow true, a single moment of wild, surging joy. They spent long minutes like that, all their kisses open-mouthed, warm and orange-gold in the candlelight. Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind went hazy, that hot-bathwater feeling again. Something was pulsing behind his navel, a deep, thrumming sensation, tidal; his inner thighs ached; his hips wanted to push up off the blankets over and over until he found the right friction. He spread his legs wider and moaned into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth, startled, when Lan Zhan dragged a hand down his thigh to his knee, pulling his leg up to wrap around Lan Zhan\u2019s waist, robes trailing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They broke apart to look at each other, panting hard. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian managed. Holding Lan Zhan\u2019s gaze, he rolled his hips up and dragged himself over Lan Zhan\u2019s lower belly, making the hottest, truest part of himself known, and had the immense pleasure of seeing Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes flutter shut, lips parting around a silent <em> \u2018oh.\u2019 </em>Wei Wuxian dropped his hands to Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cLan Zhan, you should\u2014I want you to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes were so dark. It hit Wei Wuxian all over again that they were here together, after everything, the impossible, dizzying truth of it unfurling like a lotus flower, a fat dawn-yellow peony, a paperman shaking its limbs out, coming to life. He\u2019d wanted to kiss this man since they were sixteen. This man in all his forms: the boy at the white gates, the silent, beautiful boy from the library, the boy who slept at Wei Wuxian\u2019s side on the rocky ground of the Dancing Fairy\u2019s cave, the boy who liked rabbits and floral teas and old poetry and somehow Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he said. \u201cLan Zhan, I want you to touch me, please touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said, reverent, and smoothed a hand over Wei Wuxian\u2019s thigh again, but Wei Wuxian was officially too turned on to be patient. He grabbed Lan Zhan\u2019s hand and brought it to the front of his robes where his belts were tied. Lan Zhan, bless him, didn\u2019t need to be told twice; he made quick work of the cloth belt and the thick leather one beneath, and then they were falling away from Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist and Lan Zhan\u2019s hand was on his chest, rising and falling with his breaths, fingers spread out over his heart. Wei Wuxian squirmed under his touch, whining a little. The corner of Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth quirked. Instead of taking Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes off, he ducked to kiss his throat, mouthing warm and wet at the skin just above his collar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan <em> ah</em>,\u201d Wei Wuxian protested, bucking his hips again. \u201cGet on with it, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m lying here waiting to be ravished and you\u2019re <em> not ravishing me</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s teeth grazed his skin. \u201cI am ravishing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRavish me faster!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan said, and ran his hand down Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest to his belly to the curve of his hip, fingers dipping beneath the front of his robes only once. He raised his head to look Wei Wuxian in the eye. \u201cLike this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gaped up at him. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said, so turned on he could barely think. \u201cOkay. Fuck. What the fuck. Do whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Zhan agreed, and ducked down again. Wei Wuxian tilted his head back and let the haze take over, awareness giving way to sensation: Lan Zhan\u2019s hot mouth on his neck; Lan Zhan\u2019s clever fingers finally pushing his robes open, letting the outer robe fall away, kissing across Wei Wuxian\u2019s newly exposed collarbones; one hand sliding under the inner robe, hot on Wei Wuxian\u2019s bare skin. Wei Wuxian arched into him, one leg still wrapped around his waist and the other bent open. He got to work on Lan Zhan\u2019s belts. It was a god damn ordeal picking apart the complicated knots without looking, but Lan Zhan was kissing his mouth again, taking him deeply, fucking his tongue into Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth, slow and hot and slick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders were bared to the cool air. He shivered, gasped into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth, and then of course starting laughing at himself, head thumping back into the blankets. \u201cThis is so\u2014,\u201d he couldn\u2019t speak for a second. \u201cThis is so ridiculous,\u201d he told Lan Zhan. \u201cI can barely feel pain anymore, but I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m really sensitive. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to feel this much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan smoothed a piece of hair off Wei Wuxian\u2019s forehead. His touch was so gentle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2014I knew I liked your hands on me,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. He turned his face to the side, swallowing hard. \u201cI love it when you hold me, I knew I wanted this, I just\u2014I didn\u2019t know it was gonna be this good. It\u2019s so intense,\u201d he said, and started laughing all over again, quiet and breathless. \u201cI feel it everywhere, but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t say anything, just bent to kiss Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, embarrassed. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan, ignore me, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo apologies between us,\u201d said Lan Zhan. He kissed Wei Wuxian\u2019s forehead. \u201cI want to make Wei Ying feel good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to make Lan Zhan feel good.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Lan Zhan shifted his weight to the other elbow, cupping one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s bare shoulders in his free hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, grinning, and they were kissing again, deep, heated kisses, Wei Wuxian sliding his hands under Lan Zhan\u2019s pretty robes, \u201chow many <em> layers </em> are you <em> wearing</em>,\u201d revealing his chest, his narrow waist, the peaks of his hipbones just above the waistline of his thin linen pants. The Lan robes fell around them like a snowdrift. Wei Wuxian ran sword-calloused hands over Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders, upper arms, the planes of his chest. He'd stopped wielding Suibian over a year before he\u2019d died, but those callouses wouldn\u2019t fade so easily, and he loved the subtle friction of his own hands on Lan Zhan\u2019s fine skin. Lan Zhan\u2019s palms were softer than his own, well-cared for. His middle and index fingers had a slight roughness where he plucked the strings of his guqin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the scars of Wei Wuxian\u2019s past life, even the thick, knotted one that had bisected his lower belly where Wen Qing had cut him open, were gone. The skin had regenerated; the core itself had not. His chest and back were smooth, unmarked by the Wen brand, Jiang Cheng\u2019s sword, the strange lightning fractals of the Zidian, countless other nicks and scrapes he\u2019d accumulated over the years. It had been harder to get used to than he might have thought. Waking up in a body without scars was like waking up in a body that wasn\u2019t his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had new scars. When Wei Wuxian ran his hands down Lan Zhan\u2019s back, that warm, smooth skin was cross-hatched by rough lines of scar tissue. He broke their endless kiss just long enough to lean up, pressing his open mouth to the Wen brand on Lan Zhan\u2019s chest. He still didn\u2019t know where it came from. It wouldn\u2019t have been part of a Lan punishment; it couldn\u2019t have been a Wen. It couldn\u2019t have been anyone, really, except....</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kissed it again, pressed the flat of his tongue to the center, listened to the shudder of Lan Zhan\u2019s breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said above him, pleading. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leaned back down and shoved his own bloodred inner robes the rest of the way off. He was naked all at once, completely bared. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, self-conscious in a way he wasn\u2019t accustomed to. He\u2019d never been shy about his body and he wasn\u2019t really now. It was less about hoping Lan Zhan would like what he saw and more about the loss of a final barrier; the sudden escalation of intimacy in what was already by far the most intimate experience he\u2019d ever had. \u201cLan Zhan, tell me I\u2019m handsome,\u201d he demanded jokingly, trying to get the fuck out of his own head. \u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re supposed to shower me with compliments? I don\u2019t take my clothes off for just anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t dignify the last part with a response. He just lifted his gaze from where it had fallen immediately to Wei Wuxian\u2019s nakedness and said very seriously, \u201cWei Ying is handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bad idea! Bad idea! Wei Wuxian squeaked and wrapped all his limbs around Lan Zhan, clinging to him like a monkey. \u201cSilence during\u2014this!\u201d he gasped, so full of love he was vibrating a little. \u201cThat\u2019s a rule! It\u2019s a new rule! The moment we get back to the Cloud Recesses I\u2019m putting it on the Wall!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a rule,\u201d Lan Zhan said serenely. He nipped Wei Wuxian\u2019s earlobe and said, \u201cWei Ying is very handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Embarrassingly, that made Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips buck up of their own accord. Lan Zhan made a shocked, breathy noise at the feeling of Wei Wuxian pressed against his bare stomach, and that was all it took to lose themselves again, bodies moving together, chest to chest, Lan Zhan\u2019s hands on Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs, hips, the curve of his ass. The first touch was always hesitant, the second bold. Wei Wuxian managed to shove Lan Zhan\u2019s pants down, and then they were both naked, wide-eyed and flushed and gasping in the candlelight, in the mess of blankets, the white and scarlet yin-yang of their discarded robes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian said when Lan Zhan took him in hand, \u201coh, oh Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan\u2014,\u201d but his mouth was still hot and open against Lan Zhan\u2019s so it came out like <em>La-Zha, </em>a desperate flick of the tongue, more breath than voice, <em>La-Zha, La-Zha, kiss me, don\u2019t stop, oh gods, want you deeper, want you inside me, fuck, fuck</em> <em>me</em>, shameless and too loud, chasing his pleasure with fluid movements of his hips, fingers tight in Lan Zhan\u2019s hair, <em>oh, touch me harder, </em>Lan Zhan\u2019s teeth on his collarbones, Lan Zhan panting into his mouth. Wei Wuxian arched into him and let his head fall back, exposing the lines of his body, the line of his throat. <em>Take me, take me</em>, and Lan Zhan took. His hand was so big, perfect once he found a rhythm, and at one point he reached up to brush his fingers over Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips, asking permission; Wei Wuxian took them into his mouth and sucked, moaning around them until Lan Zhan withdrew, spit trailing, and the next touch was hot and slick with spit and precome. Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips stuttered, graceless with how close he was. Lan Zhan was watching him. His hot, dark gaze was focused not between their bodies, on his hand around Wei Wuxian, but on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, \u201cI\u2019m, I can\u2019t\u2014Lan Zhan\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan kissed him. For one breathless moment, Wei Wuxian went still. In the next, he shuddered apart. He rolled his hips just as the wave crested, smearing his wetness across Lan Zhan\u2019s belly. He could hear himself moaning brokenly into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth, but all sound and sensation was distant, muted; he was suspended in deep water, but he wasn\u2019t drowning. He was just weightless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He came back to himself in increments, drifting slowly ashore. Lan Zhan had gathered him close, one arm under his back. He was kissing Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, cheeks and chin and forehead and mouth, mouth, mouth, and Wei Wuxian tried to kiss back but didn\u2019t have total control over his body yet. His thoughts were caught in amber, his thighs trembling, his breaths shaky and erratic, catching in his throat. It had never felt like this. Even before losing his core, it had never felt like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he mumbled at last, fully aware that he sounded drunk. \u201cOkay. Yeah. We\u2019re gonna do that every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan started laughing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t know what was going on. Lan Zhan was shaking in his arms, making these tiny, hitching noises into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, not even really noises, just intakes of breath. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d he said, worried Lan Zhan was crying, but then Lan Zhan lifted his head and\u2014gods, he was smiling enough to show a tiny bit of his front teeth, eyes narrowed with happiness. He stopped laughing pretty quickly, but the smile didn\u2019t fade.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Lan Zhan,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, matching that smile with his own, wide and bright. \u201cMy Lan Zhan, you\u2019re so sweet. Look at you, how can you be so sweet? I just came so hard I solved all ten of Hui Shi\u2019s paradoxes and you have the gall to be the cutest person in the world right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod damn,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, and flipped them over. He sat on Lan Zhan\u2019s thighs, staring down at him, all that pale skin and black hair spread out in the blankets. Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t come yet. He was full and flushed, and when Wei Wuxian curled his fingers around him, Lan Zhan closed his eyes and drew in a long, slow breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian brought him to the edge like that, eyes zeroed in on his face, trying out different rhythms and pressures, fascinated by the way Lan Zhan reacted, intense but internal: where Wei Wuxian might have thrown his head back or cried out, Lan Zhan only furrowed his brow, shifted his hips infinitesimally under Wei Wuxian, twisted his fingers in the blankets. It wasn\u2019t lack of interest, and it wasn\u2019t even restraint. This, Wei Wuxian realized, was simply what Lan Zhan looked like when he was being taken very carefully apart, and it was fucking glorious. Wei Wuxian paused only to spit into his own palm, which earned him an eyebrow twitch and a funny expression like Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t sure whether to find it nasty or sexy. He evidently settled on sexy, because when Wei Wuxian did it again a minute later, Lan Zhan pushed himself up onto his elbows and reached up to slide his fingers into Wei Wuxian\u2019s sweaty hair, pulling him down into a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he breathed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was about to come. Wei Wuxian sucked on his tongue once, twice, head bobbing, then broke away and bent down and took Lan Zhan into his mouth. He only had time to register <em> musky, heavy, soft skin </em>before Lan Zhan made a choked noise, muscles tensing, spilling over Wei Wuxian\u2019s tongue. It was hot, salty, oceanic, not the best taste in the world but certainly not the worst. Wei Wuxian swallowed around him and pulled off, wiping his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looked poleaxed. He was staring at Wei Wuxian with wide, shocked eyes, chest heaving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grinned, extremely satisfied with himself. He stuck out his tongue, just to get the message across because yeah, <em> he did that</em>, and said, \u201cLan Zhan tastes so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said faintly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna do that again,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, climbing off Lan Zhan\u2019s thighs to cuddle up beside him. The room had grown chilly, fire burning low and sweat cooling on Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin, so he tugged at the blankets and maneuvered Lan Zhan\u2019s limbs around until the two of them were wrapped up in a big cocoon, Wei Wuxian tucked under Lan Zhan\u2019s arm. He rested his cheek on Lan Zhan\u2019s chest and listened to his rabbit heartbeat, waited for him to come back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lan Zhan after about a thousand years. \u201cYes. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closed his eyes, exhaustion rising in him like summer twilight, hazy lavender. He felt Lan Zhan raise a hand, then the color behind his eyelids turned to black as all the candles snuffed out, leaving only the glowing embers of the hearth fire. \u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. If only I\u2019d gone to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pressed his laughing mouth to Lan Zhan\u2019s heart. Kissed him there and said, \u201cNight. Night, my Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stroked his hand over Wei Wuxian\u2019s naked hip, just once. \u201cSleep well, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, or at least he tried to. Warm and whole and alive in Lan Zhan\u2019s arms, in this soft dark with the promise of dawn, he was already halfway to a really good dream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m tired of writing to you, I\u2019m tired of not seeing you. I\u2019m tired of my heart separated from yours. I miss your face. Two decades later and that hasn\u2019t changed; all I want is to look at your face, and for you to look back at me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m coming back. Lan Zhan, I wanted to write something different just now, I wanted to write \u2018I\u2019m coming home.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty presumptuous but can you blame me! I want a home, I want a home, I want a home with you, in the mountains or on the road or anywhere else, everywhere else with you. When I see you please tell me to come back. You don\u2019t have to say \u2018home\u2019 but please tell me to come back. I\u2019ll do it if you tell me. My handwriting is so fucked right now, thank the gods I\u2019m going to burn this before you read it, you wouldn\u2019t be able to read it at all. Lan Zhan, just tell me to come back. I\u2019ve burned all these letters but I\u2019ll tell you what they said, okay? I\u2019ll write it out again. I\u2019ll tell you everything. I want you to know about me and I want to know about you.

I guess I'll send a message to the Cloud Recesses or something. Or maybe I\u2019ll just break the wards and sneak over the wall, let myself into the Jingshi, beg you to let me stay. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019ll see you soon, Lan Zhan. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Tell me to come back, okay? This time I promise I\u2019ll say yes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2735</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like so many other days, Wei Wuxian woke to the sound of Lan Zhan. Except this time it wasn\u2019t the whisper of his ink-brush on a fresh piece of paper, it was the quiet click of bowls and chopsticks being set out, the scrape of a serving spoon on the inside of a ceramic pot. Wei Wuxian kept his eyes shut for a long moment, just listening. The color behind his eyelids was grayish-blue, not red, so it had to be really early in the morning. Way too early for reasonable people to be awake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stayed quiet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying. I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband, almost,\u201d Wei Wuxian whined. \u201cYou have to be nice to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am very nice to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That made Wei Wuxian smirk and roll over, fixing Lan Zhan with the most salacious look he could muster. \u201cThat\u2019s true, Lan Zhan is <em> extremely </em> nice to me,\u201d he purred. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t you come over here and be nice to me some more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was intentionally lurid and not at all sexy. To Wei Wuxian\u2019s delight, Lan Zhan\u2019s ears still went pink. \u201cThere\u2019s congee,\u201d he said. \u201cWei Ying should eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAi Lan <em> Zhan</em>,\u201d Wei Wuxian complained, but got up and put on his inner robes anyway, as he knew the only thing Lan Zhan wanted more than to rail him was to keep him safe and warm and well-fed. It was incredibly sweet, even if Wei Wuxian would rather climb into his lap and get his hands back under those pristine white robes as soon as possible. Now he knew what Lan Zhan looked like when he kissed, when he came, with that hot dark gaze and messy black hair, robes hanging off his shoulders, sweat shining at his temples, lips bitten red, skin flawless in the moonlight, all of him a cut of moonlight, pale and glowing and unearthly beautiful, somehow real. He knew the sounds the solemn Hanguang-jun could make. Frankly, all the sect leaders should consider themselves lucky if Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t crash every meeting and banquet and conference from now until the end of time, just to stand up in front of everyone and kiss His Excellency the Chief Cultivator till his cheeks turned pink, till his breaths came fast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actually, damn, that was an image. Lan Zhan at the head of a banquet in his finest robes. Wei Wuxian draped across his lap, hand-feeding him slices of fruit. Yao-zongzhu approaching them, eyes downcast, to voice his latest grievance. Lan Zhan shutting him up with the Silence Spell, Wei Wuxian dumping a jar of wine over his head\u2014no, scratch that, waste of wine. Lan Zhan shutting him up with the Silence Spell and then making out with Wei Wuxian on the fancy table with all the fancy dishes, his hands on Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs, his teeth at Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looked up. He was abruptly aware that he\u2019d been frozen with a spoonful of congee halfway to his mouth for like thirty seconds. \u201c...Yes,\u201d he said. He could feel his entire face growing hot. \u201cYes. Hi. Good morning, Lan Zhan. What? Hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyebrow twitched. \u201cHello, Wei Ying. Are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHaaaaah,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan offered him a steamed bun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. I want you to fuck me,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lips parted. His eyes flicked from Wei Wuxian\u2019s face to the bun and back again as if searching for some sort of correlation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot right now!\u201d Wei Wuxian clarified. \u201cRight now we should probably save this town from ghosts or whatever. But. I\u2019m just warning you in advance. Because\u2014well, I\u2019m not sure how much you know about the specific logistics involved, but there\u2019s, uh, there\u2019s some stuff we should probably buy\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stared at each other over the breakfast tray.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, um.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice came out all low and breathy. He cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cSo... the ghost. The ghost of the drowned woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ghost,\u201d said Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know it exists. We know it\u2019s here in the, um. In the. In the... vicinity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not ideal,\u201d Lan Zhan agreed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone should do something about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian buried his face in his hands and groaned for exactly ten seconds. Then he stuffed the entire bun in his mouth in one go, chewing miserably. Later. Later. They had time, that was the whole point of this: having time. He wouldn\u2019t die, <em> again</em>, if Lan Zhan didn\u2019t fuck him right now at this moment. The ghost of a drowned woman was luring children into a river. They had to deal with it. Objectively, the lives of innocent children were more important than Wei Wuxian getting railed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked up. Lan Zhan was already looking back at him. There was a little red mark on his throat, just above the collar of his robes. His face was doing the soft thing. He was so handsome in the winter dawn, this bearer of light, this strange, steadfast heart. Husband. Wei Wuxian\u2019s husband.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019ll tell you everything, </em> Wei Wuxian thought. <em> I want you to know about me. I want to know about you. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, though. They had time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallowed his mouthful of spicy pork bun. He brushed the crumbs off his robes and shook out his sleeves. \u201cOkay, Lan Zhan,\u201d he said, grinning at Lan Zhan across the table. \u201cOkay, my love. Let\u2019s figure this thing out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<small>END.</small>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>"
