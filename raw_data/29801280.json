  "text": "<p>It\u2019s Wei Ying\u2019s birthday tomorrow, and after 10,949 days of life, he is still, against his wishes, a card-carrying virgin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying doesn\u2019t mind <em> most </em>of the time. Not really. He\u2019s busy enough with work that it isn\u2019t often he actively finds himself reflecting on his own lack of experience. But there is something about a 30th birthday that feels like a failed milestone. A sad little flag-wave of unwilling abstinence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As his best friend, apparently, is so keen to remind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYear thirty, Wei-xiong,\u201d Nie Huaisang says, and leans over Wei Ying\u2019s chair so that it tilts backwards with a creak. \u201cAnd still nothing, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Wei Ying says absently, clicking through a case study.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang sniffs and slouches into a chair next to Wei Ying\u2019s desk. \u201cA dangerous way to speak to someone who has sole control over your birthday rager tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That...is probably true. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about sex at work, Nie-xiong,\u201d Wei Ying says, very diplomatically. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s in my contract somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang scoffs and gives a dismissive wave of one hand, then tugs at one of his earrings. \u201cI write half of those contracts, so that\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019m fully within my rights to question you, on the eve of your third decade alive, how on earth you\u2019re both my hottest and my least-laid friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemind me why we\u2019re talking about this to begin with?\u201d Wei Ying asks, tapping the window shut and leveling a pointed look at Huaisang. \u201cDidn\u2019t Nie Mingjue condemn you to preliminary research for the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang places a sentimental hand over his heart. \u201cBecause I care, Wei-xiong. And don\u2019t bring my brother into this to distract me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been worth a shot. It\u2019s not like this is the first time Huaisang has broached this subject, though usually not at this volume and not in their place of business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, well. Huaisang is right, after all. Wei Ying is all too keenly aware that the older he gets, without experiencing that particular rite of passage into adulthood, the more of an anomaly he becomes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thing is. Wei Ying has had plenty of chances to finally \u2014 get over that last hill. The big bang, and all of that. Throughout his twenties, he\u2019s been trashed at more parties than he can count, and there had been no shortage of cute girls who\u2019d eagerly offered themselves up. He\u2019s had surprisingly good traction on dating apps, something which his friends and his brother vocally resent him for. But text conversations have rarely gone beyond the first few, superficial lines; the few dates he\u2019d landed had been resounding flops, a mutual fizzling that neither party cared to follow up on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, Wei Ying has had chances. Many of them. And he likes flirting! A lot! Flirting is fun! It\u2019s just that \u2014 whenever the opportunity had presented itself, it hadn\u2019t seemed like the right time, for whatever reason. Or the right person, or the right situation, or the right mood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, yeah. Here he is. A day away from thirty years old, single, (technically three-fourths of) a virgin, and currently at the mercy of his best friend and whatever hazing rituals he\u2019s got in the works for this evening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think what really drives me crazy about it is,\u201d Huaisang begins, introspectively.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrives <em> you </em>crazy about it?\u201d Wei Ying feels compelled to ask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that it would be so easy,\u201d Huiasang continues as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cIt would be <em> so easy </em> for you. You just go around dangling yourself in front of people like a walking snack, and then you do <em> nothing </em> with it<em>. </em>Hot privilege is wasted on you, Wei-xiong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cAlso, I hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang perks up, his face brightening as though a thought has suddenly occurred to him. \u201cYou know, you could probably land someone tonight, if you really wanted to. The \u2018it\u2019s my birthday\u2019 angle and all of that, entering a new decade of life. Thirty is kind of a sexy age, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying tilts his head, considering. It would be nice to finally have some experience to back up all of his empty, nonsense talk about his own game. Provided that he gets enough alcohol in his system, maybe this could be the time he actually convinces himself to go through with it. To swallow down that panicked, squirmy impulse shoving him toward the exit doors whenever he\u2019s confronted with the actual prospect of sleeping with a girl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would never admit it, not even to Huaisang or Jiang Cheng. He\u2019d never recover face again, given all his boasting over the years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus you know how the urban legend goes,\u201d Huaisang is saying, tapping a pen against his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying informs him that he does not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know, that old myth about cherry magic,\u201d Huaisang says, then his eyebrows knife up at Wei Ying\u2019s answering, blank stare. \u201cYou know, the whole thing where if you hit thirty and you\u2019re a virgin, you get cursed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds so fake,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cYou just made that shit up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang practically splutters in indignation. \u201cI did not! It isn\u2019t my fault you\u2019re uncultured!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real and very-not-fake urban legend that says I have to fuck someone tonight or else I\u2019m cursed forever,\u201d Wei Ying says, dropping his voice so as not to prick the ears of nearby coworkers. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could help you,\u201d Huaisang suggests. \u201cLike I said, if you really wanted to do it, it would be easy for you. I just think you don\u2019t really want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> do </em> \u2014 \u201d Wei Ying starts to protest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing wrong if you don\u2019t,\u201d Huaisang is quick to amend. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. You spend a lot of time talking about the sex you want to have and then never having it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a face at him in lieu of a response. When Huaisang\u2019s right, he\u2019s right, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>But, </em>if you truly want to enlist my services,\u201d Huaisang says, dipping his head with a small, circular hand gesture. \u201cI have literally nothing better to do with my afternoon than devoting myself to this wholesale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Ying says, bluffing through his teeth. \u201cBecause I do. Want you to, that is. Set me up and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur options at the firm are kind of limited,\u201d Huaisang points out. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been known to work well in dire circumstances. As is evidenced by most of my career.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang makes a show of scanning the office, narrowing his eyes as they jump from person to person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026what about Mianmian?\u201d Huaisang asks, swiveling Wei Ying in his chair so he\u2019s facing her direction. \u201cShe\u2019s exactly your type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying raises his eyebrows. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty and mean,\u201d says Huaisang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens his mouth to protest, then snaps it shut, which earns him a sage nod from his friend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know who else ticks those boxes?\u201d Huaisang leans over the back of the chair to talk closer into Wei Ying\u2019s ear, and then he swivels the chair about 45 degrees so that Wei Ying is facing toward where Lan Zhan is frowning over a series of documents.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rolls his eyes and casts his head against the seat-back. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Huaisang asks, then starts to waggle Wei Ying\u2019s chair back and forth in a way that makes his stomach lurch and bounce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stop </em>that, I\u2019m gonna puke up my Fruity Pebbles. Also, did you want the answer to that question alphabetically or chronologically?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChronologically,\u201d Huaisang says promptly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it all started when I was born heterosexual,\u201d Wei Ying says, ticking off on his fingers. \u201cThen it progressed to Lan Zhan almost kneecapping me at university, multiple times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked for it,\u201d Huaisang reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cBetrayal. Some friend you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em> had </em> asked for it, repeatedly and at length.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t care how straight you are or aren\u2019t,\u201d Huaisang tells him. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ll always maintain that you\u2019re way too into being bossed around to be straight. But putting that aside, there isn\u2019t a single person on earth I can imagine who wouldn\u2019t make an exception for <em> that </em> face. I mean, my god, look at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying folds his arms and frowns at Lan Zhan\u2019s flawless profile, letting his feet swing back and forth. Lan Zhan\u2019s hotness is a distracting irritant at best. He\u2019s definitely very pretty and very mean, but in a way where he clearly thinks he\u2019s better than everyone else. He certainly acts like it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go for him then,\u201d Wei Ying says to deflect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve tried,\u201d Huaisang says plaintively. \u201cIt was like flirting with a brick wall. A contemptuous brick wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contemptuous brick wall. Not a bad bio for Lan Zhan, really.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Huaisang bends down again to croon next to Wei Ying\u2019s ear, \u201cHe only has eyes for you, Wei-xiong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang is just teasing \u2014 badly, at that \u2014 and there\u2019s clearly no truth intended to it, but something about the words still makes heat prickle along Wei Ying\u2019s collar, itchy and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Wei Ying grumbles. \u201cThe only eyes he has for me are, y\u2019know. Dagger ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Huaisang half-sings, and as if sensing their scrutiny, Lan Zhan looks up and locks eyes with Wei Ying across the office. He doesn\u2019t waste a second searching for him \u2014 his gaze lasers to him immediately, like he\u2019d known exactly where to find him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang whisper-yells \u201c<em>ohshit</em>\u201d and swings Wei Ying around in the swivel chair so fast that he nearly crashes into the desk, leaving them both cackling until Nie Mingjue strides by and smacks the back of the chair threateningly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They scramble into order after that, Wei Ying diving back into his work with studious focus, and when he sneaks a glance across the office again, Lan Zhan is gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had only started working at the Nie family\u2019s cultivation firm a couple years ago. Right out of school, he\u2019d started out in the Jiang family\u2019s practice alongside his adopted brother, Jiang Cheng. His employment there hadn\u2019t even been a question, given that he\u2019d grown up with the Jiangs. However, not long after he started, Wei Ying had been disgracefully dismissed following a certain, ah \u2014 Incident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a true pal, Huaisang had informed him of an opening at his own family\u2019s practice, which is actually quite a competitive firm in the cultivation field. After a couple of interviews, skill assessments, and some close calls on background checks, Nie Mingjue had agreed to hire Wei Ying on, and that had been that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang isn\u2019t a cultivator himself, to his older brother\u2019s eternal chagrin, but he does manage the administrative stuff fairly well, in Wei Ying\u2019s opinion, when he puts his mind to it. That includes case assignments. The process is fairly straightforward: A case or request comes through, usually a haunting or a possession or something else deadly or monstrous that needs taken care of; Huaisang assigns it to one or two of the cultivators, based on their experience and availability; and off they go into the field.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for the cultivators on staff, there\u2019s Wei Ying, of course. There\u2019s Mianmian, who he\u2019s known since they were kids but has never truly surpassed casual familiarity with. Nie Mingjue, his boss and the head of the firm, although he rarely takes on cases himself unless they\u2019re the rare category 1. A few others he\u2019s not close with and who hadn\u2019t gone to his school.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s Lan Zhan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hot, boring,<em>\u00a0</em>grumpy Lan Zhan. He and Wei Ying had both studied cultivation at the same university, though their approaches to it had been markedly different. Wei Ying hadn\u2019t hesitated to dabble in less orthodox methods in his cultivation path, which had been a source of Lan Zhan\u2019s persistent reproach. They\u2019d only actually, truly fought once or twice, but it had evidently been enough to earn Lan Zhan\u2019s eternal antipathy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, Wei Ying had mostly found Lan Zhan\u2019s unconcealed dislike of him hilarious. He still does, but it cohabits with irritation at the fact that in spite of his boring personality, Lan Zhan somehow manages to outshine him in absolutely everything cultivation-related.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take today, for instance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not long after that conversation with Huaisang, Wei Ying finds Lan Zhan hogging the copier, scanning his own case studies with a lifeless expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHeyyy, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, just to be annoying. He slinks up next to Lan Zhan and playfully hip-checks him. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t budge a single cun. \u201cHard at it making those copies today, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tilts his chin to look at Wei Ying square on, his uncanny eyes unblinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eesh, looking at him directly is like going snowblind. Nevertheless, Wei Ying tips his own chin up and matches the stare with a wide grin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am almost finished,\u201d Lan Zhan says. Another thing about Lan Zhan: he always speaks with such gravity, even on the most mundane of topics, like he\u2019s a real-life android.</p>\n<p><br>\u201cNo rush, no rush.\u201d Wei Ying leans his shoulder familiarly against Lan Zhan\u2019s, who stiffens at once. Lan Zhan has been weird about touching since they were teenagers, and Wei Ying usually does all in his power to test how far he can push his boundaries. It\u2019s for Lan Zhan\u2019s own self-betterment, really, Wei Ying tells himself. He\u2019ll never find a girlfriend if he doesn\u2019t loosen up a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan always smells so fresh, some sort of cologne or aftershave or deodorant with a unique scent. Sandalwood, maybe, or balsam.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although he\u2019d gone a little rigid when Wei Ying leaned against him, Lan Zhan hasn\u2019t moved away yet, his shoulder warm and solid against Wei Ying\u2019s. This close, Wei Ying can peer down at the documents that Lan Zhan\u2019s copying. He freezes when he catches the name printed at the top of the papers. \u201cThe yaoguai in Wuxi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says, inclining his head slightly to look at Wei Ying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A sour feeling curdles in Wei Ying\u2019s stomach. He takes a step back, putting distance between them. \u201cThat was originally my case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course Lan Zhan would take his case \u2014 he\u2019s the darling of the firm, after all, and his results speak for themselves. Wei Ying is a solid second-best performer, but he\u2019s gotten yanked off of higher-risk cases before due to his...preexisting condition. Nie Mingjue is the only one here who knows about it, so he must have requested that the case be transferred.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Great, Wei Ying thinks, his spirits sinking as his shoulders slump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks at him, appearing to be somewhat at a loss as he observes Wei Ying\u2019s sudden mood shift.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not know,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying doesn\u2019t meet Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes as he forces a laugh; it\u2019s brittle, humorless. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s whatever. You\u2019ll do better on it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A tiny frown pinches Lan Zhan\u2019s marble brow, and he opens his mouth as if to say something, but Wei Ying cuts in, a little rudely, with, \u201cAre you done using that or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan steps aside in one smooth stride, allowing Wei Ying access to the copy machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s expecting Lan Zhan to turn and go with that implicit dismissal, but then he...doesn\u2019t. He hovers awkwardly in Wei Ying\u2019s periphery, for far longer than is socially comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Lan Zhan steps closer to him again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, which is an aberration. They usually don\u2019t talk unless Wei Ying initiates, and he usually initiates for the purpose of being obnoxious. Wei Ying blinks up at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan returns the stare levelly. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth hangs open a little in his surprise before he snaps it shut. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not until tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Lan Zhan, and then continues to appraise him gravely with his strange, amber-gold eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well,\u201d Wei Ying says, perking up at Lan Zhan\u2019s sudden attention. \u201cThanks! Ah, you\u2019ll probably say no and everything but \u2014 Huaisang is throwing a party for me tonight and um, you\u2019re welcome to come if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He coughs after the words are out, sealing his lips together in a tight line. That had come from nowhere, his mouth motoring into the invitation before his brain had consented to it. He\u2019s never initiated plans with Lan Zhan, ever, certainly not outside of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks at him as though making a similar observation, his face as blank as fresh parchment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, let me guess, boring, right?\u201d Wei Ying rushes to say. It\u2019s always easier to preemptively reject Lan Zhan, somehow, before he can get a snide or sullen word in on Wei Ying edgewise. \u201cOr frivolous, or something. You can just forget I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth pulls down at the corner, his gaze unwavering as Wei Ying turns to scan another document.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will consider it,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and Wei Ying snaps up with an open-mouthed \u201cah?\u201d at Lan Zhan\u2019s perfectly-sculpted back, which is already retreating across the office.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hmm. What the fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. There\u2019s a first time for everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the morning of his thirtieth birthday, Wei Ying wakes up with a jackhammer headache and his cherry firmly unpopped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a few moments, he lies as still as he can until the room stops whirling, tracking patterns in unfamiliar ceiling plaster from a couch that is not his. Then he presses his palms to his eyelids and grinds down, hard enough that his eyes throb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The evening had started out fun enough \u2014 from what he can recall, at least \u2014 but had started to go black-mold and fuzzy around the edges around his sixth drink. He remembers getting into it with Jiang Cheng, both of them drunkenly shouting at each other in a stairwell. He doesn\u2019t even remember what they\u2019d fought about \u2014 something to do with Uncle Jiang? Anyway, he has brief, patchy blips in his memory of Jiang Cheng locking him out of their apartment, his own numb fingers fumbling on the keypad as he punched the wrong code again and again. He remembers wandering aimlessly until his legs had gone wooden, as temperatures sank from brisk to biting. Finally, Huaisang, stoned out of his mind, had rescued him from the street like a stray kitten and offered him a friend\u2019s couch to crash on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Lan Zhan had never showed. Of course he hadn\u2019t. Wei Ying hadn\u2019t really expected him to, anyway. And now, on the other end of the night, he\u2019s a little grateful for it.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All in all, not one of his better birthday celebrations. Also not one of his worst. But not one for the books, and certainly nothing notable in the sex category.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, Wei Ying is fucked for the day, not in the way he would prefer, because all of his work clothes are at his shared place with Jiang Cheng, and he\u2019s already running late. He manages a harried face-wash and mouth-rinse in a stranger\u2019s sink, grimacing toothily at his own puffy reflection. Huaisang\u2019s friend had evidently departed for work earlier, and Wei Ying feels only a little guilty about rifling through their closet for suitable clothing. He\u2019ll give them right back, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s phone is a brick, long-dead from the previous night, so he has to hail a cab the old-fashioned way. The second he\u2019s in the car, he passes into a dead sleep in the backseat until his destination, at which the driver snaps him awake to get moving.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, still half-asleep, and he passes some crumpled bills into the driver\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Fucking asshole, </em>the man says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying startles, fully awake, his mouth popping open. \u201cI \u2014 excuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse you what?\u201d the driver snaps, throwing a black look over his shoulder. \u201cCan you get a move on? I\u2019ve got other riders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gets a move on, stumbling out of the backseat onto the pavement. For the next couple of minutes, he\u2019s left to scratch his head in bewilderment, staring after the cab\u2019s shrinking taillights.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weird. Wei Ying has his many faults, but he\u2019s likable as a general rule. People aren\u2019t usually so openly rude to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still a little more nettled than he\u2019d like to admit, Wei Ying shuffles into his building. There are about seven people waiting for the elevator, and they all pile in at once alongside Wei Ying, weirdly chatty for so early in the morning. Usually his rides in the building\u2019s elevator are silent and uneventful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shit, this tea-stain is everywhere, it looks like I pissed myself. Typical fucking Tuesday. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying glances around to see who\u2019d spoken, but everyone has their heads down, focused on their shoes or with their noses in their phones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone bumps into Wei Ying\u2019s right side, jostled as the elevator creaks and lurches upward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> If Pei Ming doesn\u2019t fuck me tonight, I\u2019m finally ordering a vibrator online, </em> a woman\u2019s voice says. <em> I don\u2019t give a fuck anymore. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Wei Ying blurts in his shock, turning toward the woman beside him. Everyone in the elevator swivels to stare at him, their faces a blend of hostility and confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The unfamiliar young woman stares back at him, clearly perplexed. \u201cW-What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cYou just said \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Shit, morning meeting got moved to nine, </em> a man mutters on his left. <em> Boss will kill me if I\u2019m late again. If this elevator weren\u2019t always so </em> fucking <em> slow \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Why is this weirdo staring at me? </em> the woman next to him says. Wei Ying stares at her \u2014 her unmoving mouth \u2014 and feels something in his brain glitch. <em> Hey, actually, he\u2019s not bad-looking, although he seems kinda sick. I wonder if he\u2019s interested? </em> The woman\u2019s face shifts from looking rankled to more appeasing, and she shyly tucks a lock of hair behind her ear and drops her gaze. <em> Ugh, who am I kidding. As if someone like him would ever be interested in you, ugly. Dream on. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s,\u201d Wei Ying says aloud, as the elevator dings for his floor. His voice is small and very lost. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few people shove their way out when the doors open, Wei Ying caught up in the current of them like a leaf in a gutter. Their unintelligible voices brush against him, clamoring all at once \u2014 and then he\u2019s finally alone with his thoughts, staring blankly at the closed elevator doors as he reels.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so. Unless this is the worst, weirdest hangover of his life \u2014 he\u2019s fucked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang beelines for him the second Wei Ying steps foot in the office, a hand wiring around his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shit, Wei-xiong looks rough. Totally my fuck-up on the birthday planning. Wait, are those Zonghui\u2019s clothes?! Shit, he\u2019s going to kill me \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still a little shell-shocked, Wei Ying tugs his arm quickly out of Huaisang\u2019s grip. It\u2019s one thing to hear \u2014 thoughts, if that\u2019s what they really are \u2014 from total strangers, but the idea of overhearing something private from a friend is deeply uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 okay?\u201d Huaisang is asking him something. A question about his general well-being, probably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying hazards, and judging by Huaisang\u2019s expression, he\u2019s answered the wrong question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m really sorry about last night,\u201d Huaisang says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go. Can\u2019t really prep events around Jiang Cheng being a fucking asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says on autopilot. The daze he\u2019d already been feeling from sleep loss and alcohol has settled into a light state of dissociation. His surroundings feel vague and slippery, a little unreal. Maybe he\u2019s dreaming all of this, after all. Or maybe he\u2019s dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surely his stomach wouldn\u2019t hurt this much if he were actually dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d Huaisang asks, his brows knitting together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, and shifts the too-large suit jacket over his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve got a case, I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shuffles across the office toward his desk, aware of the curious stares trailing after him. From his desk, Lan Zhan watches his approach, probably judging his bedraggled appearance and making his own conclusions about the previous night. Whatever. Wei Ying gives a wry wave to acknowledge his judgment, and Lan Zhan darts his gaze away, his expression unchanging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying flops into his seat, then spends the next hour staring at documents without seeing them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so. Huaisang had been right, somehow. This is a curse, or at least some kind of weird magic. Maybe it\u2019s someone\u2019s idea of a practical joke, someone he\u2019d pissed off on a past case. It can\u2019t <em> really </em>all be because he\u2019s still a virgin, can it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s a very straightforward fix. And surely being a mind-reader isn\u2019t the end of the world. It might even be kind of fun. Who <em> hasn\u2019t </em> wanted the ability to read people\u2019s thoughts at least once in their lives, anyway?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few energy drinks, Wei Ying\u2019s spirits have considerably lifted into a low-simmering mania, by which point Huaisang fetches him for lunch and drags him to the break room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I failed you,\u201d Huaisang begins, hanging his head. \u201cBoth on the party front and the sex front. I am the world\u2019s worst best friend and wingman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNie-xiong, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Wei Ying tells him, meaning it. \u201cI\u2019ll always have other birthdays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut this was a <em> big </em>one,\u201d Huaisang whines. \u201cThirty is huge! It was supposed to be epic!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forgetting himself, Wei Ying gives Huaisang\u2019s shoulder a kind pat, and promptly gets an earful. Despite the current conversation topic, Huaisang is consumed by thoughts of that guy Zonghui\u00a0\u2014 so maybe he\u2019s more than a friend, after all. Wei Ying quickly retracts his hand, feeling like an intruder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a place to stay tonight?\u201d Huaisang asks, just as Lan Zhan skulks into the break room with an empty mug and some tupperware. Lan Zhan soundly ignores both of them, moving toward the cabinets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying lowers his voice as he idly tracks Lan Zhan\u2019s movements. \u201cNot strictly. Not exactly. Jiang Cheng changed the entry codes to the apartment last night, and my phone\u2019s been dead so I have no way to contact him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang sucks his teeth in sympathy. \u201cShit. Well, you know I\u2019d offer my place, but given the state of, well, my everything \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nie Mingjue suddenly pokes his head into the break room, interrupting their conversation with a loud rap of his knuckles and a scowl. \u201cHuaisang. My office, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang starts to whine, but he scrambles up from the table when his brother\u2019s glare darkens. He mutters an apology to Wei Ying and scuttles out, trailing after Nie Mingjue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which leaves just him and Lan Zhan, alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a hand propped to his cheek, Wei Ying continues to watch him as Lan Zhan maneuvers around the kitchenette, pulling things down from the cabinet for his lunch. He still won\u2019t look in Wei Ying\u2019s direction, which seems like a step back, somehow, from any progress made at the copier yesterday.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan always dresses so sharply, his clothes tailored to accentuate each muscular line of his frame. His sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, crisply ironed. Even his underwear is probably custom-made, Wei Ying imagines. Would Lan Zhan wear boxers or briefs? No way is Lan Zhan a boxers guy; he\u2019s too uptight to just let his junk hang out at work. Or maybe he just goes commando all the time?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he continues to stare, Wei Ying abandons the train of thought on Lan Zhan\u2019s taste in underwear in favor of another, given recent events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What could the righteous, boring, stuffy Lan Zhan possibly be thinking about? Probably his filing system that he loves so much, or deep breathing exercises or something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. He could actually find out, if he wanted to. And he does want to. It would be the first time using his newfound ability for evil purposes, but given how Lan Zhan has treated him over the years, Wei Ying thinks he\u2019s a little entitled to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pushes his seat back with a metallic scrape against the floor and sidles over to the kitchenette. Feigning concentration on his task, he soaps up his hands in the sink and washes them, drifting closer to Lan Zhan as he waits on his tea. Finally, when he\u2019s close enough, he brushes their arms together and bites his lip on a grin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s voice is so clear, so sudden that it\u2019s as though it\u2019s spoken, the slice of a sharp object through velvet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He\u2019s touching me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying startles for a moment, wonders if he\u2019d somehow heard his own thoughts instead, but \u2014 no, that had definitely been Lan Zhan\u2019s steady, factual baritone, loud and clear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, this is still so <em> weird. </em>It still doesn\u2019t seem totally real. But how else can he account for hearing Lan Zhan\u2019s voice in his head, as clearly as if he\u2019d spoken to Wei Ying directly?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying slides his arm against Lan Zhan\u2019s again, casual enough to be accidental.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Do. Not. Give anything away, </em>Lan Zhan thinks inside Wei Ying\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>...huh. Give what away? Lan Zhan had never seemed interesting enough for secrets. Wei Ying would probe into that further, but hearing Lan Zhan\u2019s voice seizes him with a sudden, all-consuming need. An itch he can\u2019t <em> not </em>scratch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants to hear Lan Zhan\u2019s inner monologue when Wei Ying is annoying him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had always imagined, when he\u2019d teased Lan Zhan mercilessly at school, that the inner life of Lan Zhan involved privately breaking each code of his stiff decorum to curse him out. Or running calculations on the nearest locations to dump a body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, he never thought he\u2019d actually have the chance to find out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a few silent moments, Wei Ying thoughtfully watches Lan Zhan heat his tea before he opts for one of his more artless tactics. He reaches out again, tugs on Lan Zhan\u2019s starchy sleeve, and whines, \u201cLan Zhaaan. Lan Zhan, you\u2019ve been ignoring me since yesterday. Haven\u2019t I told you how that hurts my feelings? You can\u2019t treat your coworkers like this!\u201d He pitches his voice up loud enough to draw some nearby stares from their colleagues within the eyeline of the break room. Making a Scene in front of others, as Wei Ying very well knows, is the fast track to pissing Lan Zhan off. \u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>, LanZhanLanZhan \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lan Zhan says through his teeth. He holds his arm rigid to keep tea from sloshing over the rim of his mug as Wei Ying tightens his grip on his wrist and pulls, grazing against skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An image strikes Wei Ying as suddenly as a bolt of lightning \u2014 oh, it\u2019s the first time that he\u2019s actually caught <em> pictures </em> with this new ability of his \u2014 and it\u2019s of himself. In it, clearly through Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes, imaginary-Wei Ying is glaring indignantly, his mouth stuffed with a black gag.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes all of Wei Ying\u2019s willpower not to die laughing as he keeps his hand steeled to Lan Zhan\u2019s arm. God, of <em> course </em> Lan Zhan would fantasize about muzzling him. It\u2019s exactly how he\u2019d always imagined.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The image shifts, continues to play out in motion like a reel of film\u00a0 \u2014 okay, Wei Ying realizes as the pictures dart across his mind\u2019s eye, he\u2019s also restrained now, brought to his knees with his hands tied behind his back. That makes sense, that Lan Zhan would want to shut him up, keep him from moving and annoying him further. The fake Wei Ying is struggling a little against the restraints, muffled and whiny complaints through the gag \u2014 very nice job, Wei Ying thinks with approval, that <em> is </em>how he would react \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the image flickers again, and suddenly Wei Ying is looking at himself with the clothes stripped away, the gag and ties still intact, and Lan Zhan is stopping in front of him, gripping Wei Ying\u2019s jaw hard enough to dent the skin with the press of his thumb, tilting it up, Wei Ying\u2019s mouth working around the damp gag, his cheeks flushed and his eyes glazed over, glassy and wanting \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rips his hand back as though he\u2019s been scalded. His own brain buzzes suddenly with white static, blanking around the shock of what he can\u2019t unsee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares at Lan Zhan with huge eyes, clutching his hand to his chest. Lan Zhan stares back. He looks bored, maybe a little disdainful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas there something else I could help you with?\u201d Lan Zhan says dryly, like he hadn\u2019t just been \u2014 like he hadn\u2019t been thinking about \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmmm,\u201d Wei Ying says in a voice like a creaking metal hinge. \u201cNope!\u201d And he bails, fleeing toward the safety of his desk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What the fuck. What the fuck, what the fuck. His face is as hot as a summer sidewalk, stifling under his stiff work clothes as he sinks into his chair. He\u2019s a little (?) turned on (????), which is <em> only natural </em> when you have a mental video of yourself like \u2014 <em> that \u2014 </em> unwittingly beamed into your brain, it\u2019s not like it has anything to do with the fact that \u2014\u00a0that it had been \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying buries his face in his hands, his cheeks warm to the touch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What the fuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surely, there\u2019s an explanation, Wei Ying reasons after fifteen minutes of brown-noise panic. This is<em> Lan Zhan</em>, after all. Who wants him dead. There is a rational answer here, and Wei Ying will find it. For the sake of his own sanity, if nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He resolves to avoid Lan Zhan for the rest of the day (or potentially, based on how that fares, the rest of his life), but not even two hours later, they end up stuck on a crowded elevator together on their way to the same meeting. People pack in around them, their thoughts brushing against Wei Ying along various points of contact, dragonflies skimming across a pond surface \u2014 idle complaints and discomforts and trivialities that he hardly registers. Beside him, Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder crams against Wei Ying\u2019s as they\u2019re jostled, and like the blurry flash of an image whizzing by on an amusement park ride, Wei Ying sees himself being pushed to his knees by Lan Zhan\u2019s hand, his mouth parted wide, gazing up at Lan Zhan dark-eyed and hazy, just as he had before. Wei Ying jerks away, plasters himself against the elevator wall, and reels.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so. Lan Zhan wants to fuck him. Just a little bit, maybe not even the full thing. But like, out of spite, which honestly tracks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even though Wei Ying is a virgin, he watches his fair share of pornography\u00a0\u2014 but even <em> he </em> isn\u2019t at work imagining his coworkers in such scenarios. <em> Lan Zhan, </em> of all people, Lan Zhan. Lan Zhan?! For all his musings about what goes on in Lan Zhan\u2019s head \u2014 for all his teasing about Lan Zhan\u2019s stiff discomfort around sex \u2014 Wei Ying <em> never </em> would have sincerely guessed such thoughts brewed beneath such a righteous, stoic exterior. It would be almost funny, if he weren\u2019t the subject of them, but he <em> is </em> the subject of them, which makes it terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe, Wei Ying thinks later that afternoon, once he recovers from the initial shock of it, <em> maybe </em> he\u2019s getting worked up over nothing. Isn\u2019t it just human nature, after all? Everyone is thinking about sex all the time, at least a little bit, at least peripherally. Virgin or not. Everyone has fantasies, especially when they\u2019re bored at work. Right?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is probably just. The nearest possible shiny object. He\u2019s under no illusions about his own looks \u2014 well, he\u2019s nowhere near the league of Lan Zhan\u2019s ethereal, Harper\u2019s-Bazaar-cover beauty, but he\u2019s not <em> bad </em> to look at either. Girls have told him he\u2019s cute, that he has a nice smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That must be it, Wei Ying finally reasons. Boredom, spite, maybe some weird psychological projection shit that Lan Zhan needs to unpack. Lan Zhan may not even be consciously aware that he\u2019s experiencing these thoughts. Does it mean Lan Zhan is gay? Maybe, but not necessarily. Wei Ying has had thoughts about plenty of guys before, after all \u2014 he\u2019s comfortable enough in his heterosexuality to admit that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so he\u2019s Lan Zhan\u2019s idle fuck fantasy when he\u2019s bored at work. He can work with that. Wei Ying isn\u2019t into men, but it\u2019s pretty flattering that someone as staggeringly hot as Lan Zhan would consider him in such a way, especially given, you know. Their entire history.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying throws himself into work for the rest of the day, pulling file after file on a recent haunting in Jiaxing. It sounds like the situation has resolved for now, but sometimes Nie Mingjue deploys him or one of the other cultivators for a post-mortem, just to tie up the final ends and to ensure no other kinks have appeared after a case is closed. Wei Ying usually wouldn\u2019t dedicate such attention to backlog work like this, but he\u2019s desperate to distract himself. He finds himself hyper-conscious of Lan Zhan for the rest of the afternoon, suspiciously tracking each of his movements from the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He buries himself so deep in documents that he\u2019s startled to find when he looks up, an unknown amount of time later, that he\u2019s nearly alone in the office, darkness bruising the windows. His eyes are dry, stinging with exhaustion and eyestrain, and he rubs them hard with the heels of his palms until spots of color appear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says directly by his shoulder, and Wei Ying startles so badly that he nearly crashes his rolling chair into him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wei Ying says, rocketing out of his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 why aren\u2019t you gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him. He\u2019s holding a sheaf of documents in his hands, Wei Ying notices.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI stayed late to work on a case,\u201d Lan Zhan answers, after another beat. \u201cAs I usually do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying says, feeling horrifically awkward. Is Lan Zhan still thinking about putting him on his knees? He\u2019s terrified to know what happened next, in that mental scenario. Maybe Lan Zhan had tied him up like he had in the first image, trussed up and immobilized \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying does not usually stay so late,\u201d Lan Zhan observes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cI, ah, also got sucked into a case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe gui in Jiaxing,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees. \u201cI saw. I pulled supplemental information on it. From my own research.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s gaze drops to the files that Lan Zhan\u2019s holding, and he narrows his eyes in suspicion. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s expression is blank, maybe a little confused. \u201cI thought it could help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had been a notorious slacker in school, but it\u2019s only because he\u2019d never needed to study. He\u2019d still pulled off top marks; high enough to rival Lan Zhan\u2019s, anyway. It\u2019s to be expected that Lan Zhan would keep the same opinion of him, even now that they share a profession: that Wei Ying\u2019s work is lacking, that he can\u2019t do his own research.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is itching to say he\u2019s got it covered on his own, thank you very much, that he doesn\u2019t need Lan Zhan\u2019s patronization. But it would be openly rude to reject the offering, so he moves forward, bumbling and too fast, to accept the files with mumbled thanks.<em>\u00a0</em>Due to aforementioned exhaustion and eyestrain, his depth perception skews, and the files fall just short of his hands, scattering all over the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he says with feigned cheer, and wearily drops to his knees to start scooping them up in quick scrapes. \u201cSorry, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t respond; he simply kneels down next to Wei Ying and also begins to gather the files, the white glint of his watch-face bobbing. He\u2019d probably had all of these systematized in some way, Wei Ying realizes, and feels a little abashed for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan reaches out to pass them one at a time, and their fingers brush even as Wei Ying tries to move his own hand away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014 <em> Ying looks tired. Has he been sleeping? He did not eat today, either. Something must have happened. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s hands slow in their motions, unconsciously lingering on Lan Zhan\u2019s as he tunes into his thoughts. Had he been that off today that even Lan Zhan noticed?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I haven't seen him smile all day, </em> Lan Zhan thinks, and hands another file to Wei Ying. Nothing is given away on his face \u2014 still that unreadable mask, the smooth cast of his features like marble. <em> The entire office was dimmer without it. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying yanks his hand back, blood rushing to his head. The reaction is strange, too abrupt for the current context, but he suddenly \u2014 feels weird. His face is furnace-hot, a squirmy feeling kicking around his ribs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Zhan asks. The remaining files have frozen in his hands. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying says immediately, on reflex. \u201cJust \u2014 ah, long day. Really long, really weird day. I think I\u2019m probably just gonna go. Thanks for the \u2014 files and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gathering the documents messily to his chest, he shoots to his feet, then uses one arm to shrug on the suit jacket draped over the back of his chair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stands and watches him in silence, and then, just as Wei Ying is about to turn to go with a hurried <em> good night, </em>he says, \u201cI will accompany you out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if today could get <em> any </em>fucking weirder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhhh,\u201d Wei Ying says, completely thrown for how to respond. \u201cI. Ah. S...ure, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And this is how he ends up in the elevator with Lan Zhan for the second time that day. Wei Ying keeps a careful distance between them, hawkishly monitoring Lan Zhan\u2019s movements to make sure he doesn\u2019t stray too close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds that he doesn\u2019t need to worry \u2014 Lan Zhan and his thing with touching people, after all. Wei Ying never thought he\u2019d be so grateful for that particular quirk. Lan Zhan keeps to his space all the way down, then follows after him as Wei Ying books it toward the office exit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The burst of night air across his skin makes him shiver, goosebumps rippling along his arms. The material of his borrowed clothes is far from insular, and the weather has started to cool in the evenings as the autumn months bed down into winter. Of course, in his rush, he hadn\u2019t even thought to steal more layers from Huaisang\u2019s friend this morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Wei Ying knows what\u2019s happening, Lan Zhan is shrugging out of his coat beside him. He\u2019s sporting yet another peacoat underneath, because Lan Zhan wears an absolutely obscene number of layers when it gets cold out. Or during any other time of year, actually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, what, no,\u201d Wei Ying protests. He has sort of a knee-jerk panic reaction to people doing charitable things for him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that, aiyo, I\u2019m really fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth flattens as if in displeasure or impatience, and then he\u2019s stepping forward, draping the coat around Wei Ying\u2019s shoulders. It\u2019s warm from Lan Zhan\u2019s body heat, thick and crafted from some nice material that Wei Ying could never afford. Despite himself, Wei Ying hunkers into it, reaching up to tug the coat tighter around himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hands are also working swiftly, adjusting the fabric over his shoulders. He has big hands, graceful and guqin-callused. Before Wei Ying can move his own away, Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers collide with his, and just like that, Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts are ringing in his ears again \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014 <em> doesn\u2019t look after himself. Wei Ying deserves to have someone care for him. If he would let me \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying retreats a few steps, his breath punching out of him. Lan Zhan\u2019s hands hover in their current position, then lower, very slowly, to his sides.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d he asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying watches his mouth move to make sure the words are spoken out loud. Maybe he\u2019s truly losing it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve just got to \u2014\u201d Wei Ying stammers, taking one stumbling step backward toward the street. \u201cAh, go \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Lan Zhan surprises him, for the umpteenth time that night. He stops him, reaching out to grab the fabric of his coat sleeve. Close, very close, but no body contact \u2014 the quiet in Wei Ying\u2019s head feels precarious, holding its breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI overheard your conversation with Nie Huaisang earlier today,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cYou said you have nowhere to stay tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shit. Lan Zhan had heard that? Wei Ying rapidly bounces his weight from toe to heel, cold and uncomfortable in equal measure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, my brother and I got into a fight yesterday and so he changed the locks,\u201d Wei Ying says, tugging his sleeve away from Lan Zhan\u2019s grip. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it in like two days. It\u2019s fine, I can find a couch somewhere for the night.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Mianmian will take him up. They\u2019ve never been all that close, but they are colleagues, after all, and she seems cool enough. Wen Qing\u2019s probably on a night-shift at the hospital and totally off-grid, but he could probably get a hold of her if he needed to. Huaisang would offer if his studio wasn\u2019t an absolute bomb-blast with no spare room to stand, let alone sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d Lan Zhan says. It is hardly a question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blue-screens for one, two, three seconds, then starts to laugh, reedy and nervous. \u201cYou really want me under your roof, Lan Zhan? I might destroy your apartment. I might annoy you to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, Wei Ying is expecting that reminding Lan Zhan of his long-standing distaste for him will be an effective tactic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have nowhere to stay,\u201d Lan Zhan says slowly. \u201cI have a spare bed. I insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou insist,\u201d Wei Ying echoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI insist,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, and there\u2019s \u2014 holy shit, the tiniest crook of a smile, a small hooked shadow in the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What the fuck is happening, Wei Ying thinks, a little hysterical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Lan Zhan asks, although Wei Ying knows that <em> he </em>knows the answer is a resounding no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying considers lying, then decides the effort would be futile. Lan Zhan is so damn stubborn about things, when he wants to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, a little sullenly. Then adds, feeling defensive, \u201cSometimes I forget, it\u2019s not a \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be a whole thing, I\u2019m really fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concern that he\u2019d read from Lan Zhan, just moments ago, still needles Wei Ying with small teeth. The prickling sensation, he realizes, is discomfort, although he isn\u2019t sure for what.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just that \u2014 knowing someone is evaluating how he cares for himself is uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Knowing Lan Zhan is the one doing so, it\u2019s \u2014 even more uncomfortable. More uncomfortable, for whatever reason, than if it were anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should eat,\u201d Lan Zhan says firmly. \u201cThere\u2019s a place nearby, a close walk from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wants to drag his heels and protest. Any second longer spent with Lan Zhan, accidental brushes of hands and limbs, purposeful touches or whatever,<em>\u00a0</em>means further risk of another gag incident. Or, worse, another <em> is he getting sleep </em>incident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is still your birthday,\u201d Lan Zhan points out, as if this has something to do with anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. Yeah, it is. Somehow, in all of today\u2019s madness, Wei Ying had forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he says uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Zhan says, already a few strides ahead of him, and he stares at Wei Ying expectantly in his stupid, well-fitted peacoat until Wei Ying mutters and complies, slouching his way after Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has to jog a little to keep apace \u2014 Lan Zhan\u2019s legs are long, and his gait is brisk. In doing so, their shoulders jostle, and Wei Ying catches himself hesitating, lingering on the musical sound of Lan Zhan\u2019s voice \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Is he still cold? Should I offer my other coat? He will say no if I ask him directly. Does he run cold when he sleeps? I have spare blankets if he </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying quickly moves his arm away. A ridiculous, flustered warmth has risen to his face, tingling against the cold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is rapidly becoming evident that, in a horrible turn of events, Lan Zhan may actually be a decent person in addition to being beautiful and very competent at his job.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This cannot stand, Wei Ying thinks, very put out by this discovery. It ruins the whole \u2014 their whole <em> thing </em>if Lan Zhan secretly doesn\u2019t hate him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> What whole thing? </em> he then has to wonder. And what would be so bad about ruining it, morphing into something else beyond it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying abandons the line of inquiry, suddenly uncomfortable. He doesn\u2019t want to think about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stops on the sidewalk, then holds the door for him so that Wei Ying has to duck under his arm to burrow his way into the warm bubble of the restaurant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d Wei Ying says, blinking around the red-lit interior as he finally registers their surroundings. The familiar smells and ambiance are an immediate wash of comfort to his senses. He feels himself uncoiling, relaxing. \u201cI love this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hums and moves past him, their shoulders knocking together, Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking <em> I know, </em>and suddenly Wei Ying is blushing and rendered stupid all over again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is so dumb. It\u2019s dumb to get worked up about this, any of it. So what if Lan Zhan knows his sleep schedule and which restaurants he likes and thinks about gagging Wei Ying with all the casual apathy of reading the morning news. It\u2019s not like it has to mean anything, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They slide into the booth on opposite sides. Lan Zhan orders them both hot water while Wei Ying rubs his hands together to jog the feeling back to his fingers, his knuckles splotchy with pink along the patches of his drier skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No sooner has he made the observation that Lan Zhan is saying, \u201cHere,\u201d and passing a small bottle of hand lotion across the table. Wei Ying stares at it like he\u2019s been handed a live scorpion, then engages Lan Zhan in a long, fearful staring contest. He\u2019d never paused to consider if this mind-reading thing was a two-way street, and he experiences a sudden, sickening lurch at the notion, but it\u2019s not like he has anything to hide, right? Other than the fact that if Lan Zhan were reading his thoughts, he would know that Wei Ying \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014 that Wei Ying what?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him, his perplexity deepening into a visible furrow the longer Wei Ying doesn\u2019t take the offering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Wei Ying eventually mutters, then takes the lotion from Lan Zhan, careful to avoid any contact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is younger than he is, anyway, by a few months. If this wretched virgin myth really is for real (and he cannot fathom a universe in which Lan Zhan is not a virgin), then he should be in the clear for now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It is enough just to sit here with him, </em> Lan Zhan\u2019s voice says, and Wei Ying startles, badly, before he realizes their feet are touching under the table. <em> Just to be with him. To see his </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying clears his throat and hastily moves his foot away. The situation is devolving at a breakneck pace. Heavens, he thinks dismally, Lan Zhan might actually care about him underneath all those layers of permafrost. A warm current that runs beneath the thick iceberg of his fa\u00e7ade.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The knowledge feels threatening, and Wei Ying doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan calls the server over, who bustles over to greet them and take their order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Ying tells the server, then opens his mouth to order before \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014 Lan Zhan thinks, <em> He will order kou shui ji</em>. The foot is back, Wei Ying realizes too late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying <em> had </em>been about to order kou shui ji, but now he feels the contrarian need to spite Lan Zhan and his quiet, idle assuredness. The way he hadn\u2019t even glanced up from the menu as he\u2019d thought it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the dan dan noodles,\u201d Wei Ying says doggedly, \u201cwith a side of \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Chili oil wontons, </em>Lan Zhan thinks absently, still not looking up from the menu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 chili oil wontons,\u201d Wei Ying finishes, deflated, and he props his chin on his arms to sulk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust jasmine tea, please,\u201d Lan Zhan says, finally glancing up at the server. When had he put on reading glasses? Lan Zhan wears glasses? How does Lan Zhan know which side-plates Wei Ying orders and Wei Ying is unaware of the extant relationship between Lan Zhan and glasses? Wei Ying can\u2019t even enjoy a moment of smug satisfaction at the evidence that Lan Zhan has a biological flaw because he finds himself too distracted by how Lan Zhan looks in them, professorial and a little supercilious. How he\u2019d look with them in that image Wei Ying had accidentally unearthed earlier, if Wei Ying were on his knees and gagged, Lan Zhan\u2019s thumb working Wei Ying\u2019s mouth open wider around the cloth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying excuses himself to find refuge in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spends the next several moments splashing cold water on his face, wetting the ends of his hair and the collar of his shirt. He unkindly tells his reflection to get a grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying scrutinizes his own features, the familiar bow of his lips pushed out in a natural pout. His ears are still red as coals from the cold outside. His hair is a little windswept, the dark lines under his eyes stark. He does look very much like someone who\u2019d passed a sleepless night, or several in a row.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. Now, he...has a place to stay. Maybe to get a full night\u2019s rest. Which isn\u2019t so bad when he thinks about it, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying considers this. It might actually be kind of nice, in the long run, that Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t secretly despise him. It\u2019s also a small win, in a way. <em> Take that, Lan Zhan, </em> Wei Ying thinks, triumphantly. So he\u2019s not so stuffy and uncaring, after all. Wei Ying\u2019s charms had eventually worn him down at least a little bit, no matter how much Lan Zhan may feign disdain on the surface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, Wei Ying can do this. He just has to pretend as though nothing\u2019s changed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He returns to his seat a few moments later, feeling a little brighter and fresher than before. Lan Zhan\u2019s tea has arrived, and he has the black mug clasped between his pale hands to warm them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After another silent moment, Wei Ying starts to squirm in his seat. He and Lan Zhan, they don\u2019t often \u2014 do this. Spend time alone outside of work, that is. He\u2019s used to chattering circles around Lan Zhan while Lan Zhan either silently nods or frowns and <em> hms </em>with disapproval. Wei Ying has no compass for the evening, no scripts. For the first time in his life where it concerns Lan Zhan, he is excruciatingly unsure of what to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is still sipping at his tea, slow and intermittent. He hadn\u2019t ordered any dishes, Wei Ying remembers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, wiggling forward a little. \u201cYou hate spicy food, and you don\u2019t eat meat. Why did you take us to a place that almost exclusively serves those things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not need to eat,\u201d Lan Zhan says pointedly. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a face at him. \u201cI eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo Red Bulls do not qualify as sustenance,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying tilts his head and leans his weight forward into his elbows. He decides to push his luck. \u201cTell me, Lan Zhan, do you often watch what I eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lashes lower over the rim of his mug, as black as ink runes. His eyelashes have always been so long, Wei Ying thinks, almost feminine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sets the mug on the table with a quiet clop. His mouth is startlingly pink, shiny with tea. He looks up at Wei Ying through his lashes, catches him in the act of close observation, and Wei Ying finds himself caught like a fox with its foot in a trap, unable to look away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is the first to break the stare, dropping his gaze again to drink more of his tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wets his lips, then says, far more weakly than before, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it bother you if I did?\u201d Lan Zhan asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it bother me if you,\u201d Wei Ying says, having lost the plot entirely. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNoticed you,\u201d Lan Zhan answers. He speaks with a strange intentness, his gaze a gravitational center. \u201cAnd the things you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth is so dry, drought-dry. He\u2019s so out of his depth here that he\u2019s spinning loops around it, dizzied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d is all he can summon, and then food is being set down in front of him, nicely severing the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying eats quickly and quietly, cautious to keep any stray limbs or feet away from Lan Zhan. He had ordered too much food for one person, especially with his appetite as fickle as it\u2019s been lately, but he eats as much of it as he can because Lan Zhan had taken the time and effort out of his evening for this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Ying says a moment later through a mouthful of chicken, then chases it with a swig of water. \u201cI\u2019m taking forever and you\u2019re stuck here with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am in no rush,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. \u201cTake your time, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying still hasn\u2019t adjusted his footing to Lan Zhan being nice to him. And so weirdly considerate. Has Lan Zhan always been this nice to him, and Wei Ying simply hadn\u2019t noticed? No, there\u2019s no way. He has distinct memories from school of Lan Zhan berating him, his clenched jaw and flinty eyes and his fury when he\u2019d discovered Wei Ying\u2019s experimental cultivation work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stretches his memory like taffy, grappling desperately to recall the last time Lan Zhan had been mean to him at work. There had been this afternoon, when Lan Zhan had snapped at him a little right before the \u2014 The Gag Incident \u2014 but it had been prompted by Wei Ying deliberately winding him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says abruptly, too absorbed in this revelation to be tactful. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you really disliked me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him for a moment, perhaps questioning the randomness of this admission. Then he says, slowly, \u201cI do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I,\u201d Wei Ying says feebly. His food is starting to cool, and he\u2019s completely lost his appetite, anyway. He sets his chopsticks down. \u201cI always pester you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cSo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t like me,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cRight? It\u2019s always been that you \u2014 that we \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is frazzling a little at the edges, from sleep loss and the events of the day and his own confusion, his brain sparking up and smoking like a shot power line.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat we what,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat we don\u2019t get along,\u201d Wei Ying says. He\u2019s surprised to hear how upset he sounds. \u201cThat\u2019s always been how we are \u2014 oil and water. Dog shit and Velcro. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is the dog shit in this analogy?\u201d Lan Zhan wonders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe! Obviously me!\u201d Wei Ying says, and resolutely ignores the little zap that circulates through him at the unfamiliar sound of Lan Zhan swearing. \u201cLan Zhan, you can\u2019t tell me that we\u2019re actually friends and I never knew about it. I mean \u2014 who was going to tell me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at Wei Ying for another long moment. The heart shape of his mouth is slightly parted. He looks a little lost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are colleagues,\u201d Lan Zhan eventually says. More stiffly, he continues, \u201cWe do not have to be friends. If you do not wish it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Wei Ying says, \u201chang on, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just that \u2014 if they\u2019re friends, then there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no friendly way to think about gagging someone and tying them up, right? With clothes or without, but the <em> without </em> does seem significant here. Wei Ying may be a virgin, but he\u2019s definitely no prudish, innocent maiden. If Lan Zhan considers them <em> friends</em>, then that means \u2014 when he\u2019d been thinking those things earlier, it means \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. It\u2019s not even a possibility.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, his voice softer than before. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says, shaking his head. \u201cYeah, I just. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we will go,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and pulls out his phone to pay the tab.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, wait, you\u2019re not paying for me,\u201d Wei Ying protests, reaching across the table to make a quick grab for the phone. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even eat anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not mind,\u201d Lan Zhan says, holding the phone just out of Wei Ying\u2019s reach. With a deadly focus, he starts to tap the screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the <em> point,</em>\u201d Wei Ying insists. \u201cI can pay for myself, Lan Zhan, this isn\u2019t a \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan goes frozen in subtle, disjointed increments \u2014 his fingers stilling, his expression settling into a plaster mold. Wei Ying is watching him, watching him closely as he has been all night, so he notices. His cheeks sting with heat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was going to say <em> date</em>. Lan Zhan knows it too. He attempts to save face anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 charity event,\u201d Wei Ying recovers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it makes you uncomfortable,\u201d Lan Zhan says, tapping one last button and clicking the lock button on his phone. \u201cYou can pay next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next time. Next time, as in \u2014 future plans to eat somewhere with Wei Ying. Okay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying mutters, and rakes a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m already putting you out by staying at your place, you don\u2019t need to \u2014 do all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says. His voice is kind. \u201cI offered. In both cases. If I minded, I would say so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying puffs out his cheeks and pinches his lips, then lets the air out in a slow whistle through his teeth. \u201c<em>Fine</em>. You win on decency for the night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not a competition,\u201d Lan Zhan says, in a tone that Wei Ying interprets to mean, <em> But I would be winning. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m calling the DiDi,\u201d Wei Ying says quickly, just as Lan Zhan slides out of the booth and gets smoothly to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just arrived,\u201d Lan Zhan says with a tiny shake of his phone, and then he\u2019s moving toward the exit of the restaurant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Speechless, Wei Ying gapes after him for a moment, and then has no choice but to grudgingly follow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing Wei Ying notices about Lan Zhan\u2019s place is that he lives alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is obviously a given, knowing Lan Zhan. It\u2019s just that Wei Ying is so used to sharing his cramped space with another person that it\u2019s the first perception that strikes him when he walks in the door \u2014 the smooth silence of the space, as undisturbed as a fresh layer of snow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying kicks off his shoes, then unpeels Lan Zhan\u2019s coat from his shoulders to hang up. It smells like Lan Zhan, whatever that distinct woodsy scent is. The apartment also smells like it. Wei Ying will probably smell like it now, too. He\u2019s surprised to find that he doesn\u2019t really mind the thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s place is monkishly clean, because of course it is. There are a few live plants potted around the place, but other than that, the decor is fairly colorless, black countertops and gray hardwood floors. There\u2019s a small bookshelf, a mid-sized white sofa, and a guqin mounted on the wall; a frankly astonishing array of cookware arranged like an art display in the kitchen, and a round, slick white table with some paperwork still neatly stacked atop it. The furthest wall is entirely windows from ceiling to floor. A panoramic view of the city skyline glitters like crushed jewels through the glass panes, the lights flickering with smog.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All in all, it looks like a place where someone lives alone. It looks like a place where someone expects to live alone for the foreseeable future. Wei Ying feels a little dirty just standing there, like he\u2019s trailing the chaos and filth of the city in with him. Like he\u2019s soiling the space just by his presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives Wei Ying a quiet and unceremonious tour of the main space and bathroom, though the bedroom door remains firmly shut. Wei Ying manages to keep his commentary to himself for most of it, but goggles when they reach the enormous shower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could fit like four people in there,\u201d he tells Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, a little critically. \u201cIt\u2019s too big. I have looked into downsizing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut this place is so nice,\u201d Wei Ying protests. If he <em> ever </em>had a place as nice as this, he\u2019d cling to it until he got forcibly evicted. Plus, it feels very \u2014 Lan Zhan. Sharp, sleek interiors, but not ostentatious. Understated, almost humble in spite of the clear caliber of lifestyle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not really Wei Ying\u2019s personal taste, but if he could spend time in a place like this, well \u2014 he thinks he\u2019d be really content about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the very least, don\u2019t get rid of this place because of the shower,\u201d Wei Ying adds. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan inclines his head slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to use it, if you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea of showering at Lan Zhan\u2019s place is so suddenly bizarre \u2014 even moreso than the idea of sleeping here \u2014\u00a0that Wei Ying laughs outright, even though it\u2019s a perfectly normal and polite suggestion for a guest. Plus, this shower is way too luxurious for him, so much so that he can\u2019t even visualize the concept of himself actually using it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan, though, he could imagine using it. It suits him, just like the rest of this place. Not that he can imagine Lan Zhan showering. Or that he would want to. It had just been a thought experiment. Anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan leads him into the kitchen, where without any further preamble, Wei Ying starts to rummage through the cabinets, curious about what food Lan Zhan keeps in-home. Lan Zhan exhales lightly, like he\u2019s exasperated, but does nothing to stop him, surprisingly enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Not </em> surprisingly, Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t keep any snacks around, just raw ingredients for things. Which means he probably cooks, because of course he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, are you getting balanced meals?\u201d Wei Ying asks, moving onto the next cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m picking up on a severe lack of processed foods here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer to cook,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. Wei Ying knew it. He knows things about Lan Zhan now, he guesses, which is a new development.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stretches on tiptoe to reach the top cabinet, and audibly gawks when he opens it. There are at least five jars of liquor neatly lined up inside. No cheap shit, either \u2014 it\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Smile, he realizes, which is like. So far above Wei Ying\u2019s paygrade that he isn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, are you actually a secret alcoholic?\u201d Wei Ying demands, reaching out to touch one of the jars.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives a small huff next to him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns to look at him with a raised brow. \u201cPlanning on a huge rager, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo mysterious, gege,\u201d Wei Ying teases, and shuts the cabinet. \u201cAlright, keep your secrets, but I whole-heartedly approve of your choices!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It\u2019s good he approves, </em> Lan Zhan thinks, when Wei Ying brushes past him, <em> when all of it is for him. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stumbles, and Lan Zhan reaches out to steady him by the elbow. Wei Ying jerks away, more on a panicked reflex than anything, and Lan Zhan drops his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had spent God even knows how much money on liquor that he doesn\u2019t even drink, for. For what, as a gift for Wei Ying? How long has he had it? The bottles had been fuzzed over with a thin layer of dust.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take you up on that shower now,\u201d Wei Ying says, avoiding Lan Zhan\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>None of it makes any sense. This isn\u2019t the Lan Zhan that Wei Ying had imagined at all \u2014 all of his preconceptions about the person he thought he knew have been violently uprooted, just in the span of a single day. It\u2019s all very overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rainfall of shower water that beats down on his head is percussive. Soothing, mostly because Lan Zhan has sick water pressure. (Of course he does.) Wei Ying spends so long in the shower, lost in his own thoughts, that his skin flushes salmon-pink from steam and heat, his fingertips pruning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Does everyone buy a small liquor store for people they want to spite-fuck? Wei Ying wonders as he towels off. (Oh, Lan Zhan\u2019s towels are soft. Bunny-soft.) As has been firmly established, Wei Ying can hardly claim any experience in the way of sex and romance. Maybe this is just a very...<em>normal </em>thing, and he\u2019s simply too na\u00efve to realize it. Maybe Lan Zhan trots a whole host of prospects through and woos each of them with dinner and nice liquor and comfortable pajamas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Either way, there\u2019s no reason to freak out about it, he reminds himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying emerges from the bathroom, the cool air of the apartment cuts through the gummy heat of shower mist. He feels more refreshed than he has in \u2014 well, weeks, maybe. Just a really long shower and a nice towel is all it takes, apparently. He tucks the towel more securely around his shoulders and meanders out into the main area, where he finds Lan Zhan settled into the couch in his sleep-clothes, reading a book with a cup of tea. He looks like something out of a still-life painting, perfectly rendered. His hair is loose from its usual ponytail, brushing against his shoulders. Wei Ying has never seen him with his hair down, or so generally\u2026uncollected. He can\u2019t help it: he stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan glances up at his approach, and there\u2019s a flicker of \u2014 something across his expression that Wei Ying can\u2019t name, as fleeting as a mote of dust catching the light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Ying says, then scrubs a hand through his wet hair, feeling awkward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Lan Zhan echoes, weirdly soft, and he shuts his book.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for letting me use your fancy shower,\u201d Wei Ying says, just for something to say, so there are no pockets of weird silence between them left uninterrupted. \u201cLike, holy shit, that might have been the best shower of my life.\u201d He wags a chiding finger. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me all this time, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can use it any time you want,\u201d Lan Zhan replies, then purses his lips and turns slightly pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying coughs out a strange sound, half-laugh and half-nervous hum. \u201cOkay, yeah. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bed has been made up for you,\u201d Lan Zhan says, clearly keen to switch subjects. \u201cYou should find everything you need there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks at him, a half-step behind. \u201cWait, you said you had a spare bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cAn air mattress, which I will take.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, what,\u201d Wei Ying protests. A visceral discomfort wriggles through him. \u201cI\u2019m already putting you out by staying here, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m kicking you out of your <em> actual bed. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying is a guest,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I hate beds,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cSo there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The corner of Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth twitches in amusement. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I would be happy to sleep in your bathtub. I\u2019m not going to force you out of your bed,\u201d Wei Ying insists. It\u2019s the charitable-things panic again, a slow clench in his stomach that makes him scratchy all over. \u201cPlease, I really want to sleep on your air mattress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan surveys him a little bit longer, inscrutable, then gives a slow nod. \u201cIf that is your preference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying relaxes, his shoulders sagging a little. \u201cIt is, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is already made up,\u201d Lan Zhan says, standing up and rounding the couch. He\u2019s wearing slippers, Wei Ying notes. Oh, that\u2019s. Hmm. Fine, it\u2019s cute. Objectively. \u201cAnything in the apartment is yours, should you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you can\u2019t say things like that,\u201d Wei Ying says with a stilted laugh. \u201cOr else I\u2019ll hang around here too long and then you\u2019ll end up stuck with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah, he hadn\u2019t \u2014\u00a0meant to say that out loud. Not all weird like that. Lan Zhan stops in front of him and just stares at him. Wei Ying stares back, paralyzed, his heart in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be tired,\u201d Lan Zhan says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll let you rest.\u201d Then he reaches out, and Wei Ying short-circuits \u2014 is he going to \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tugs the damp towel from his shoulders. Oh. Okay. Just that. But then his fingers brush against Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder when he pulls away, and just like before, the image borrows his eyes, consumes his entire field of vision \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2014 with Lan Zhan\u2019s hand on Wei Ying\u2019s cheek, Wei Ying\u2019s skin blushy and pink and warm to the touch, his mouth slightly open with surprise, but his eyes dark with heat, a little moist. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em><br></em> <em> \u201cLan Zhan, what...\u201d the other Wei Ying breathes, and Lan Zhan leans in without hesitating, his thumb to the bolt of Wei Ying\u2019s jaw, and kisses him \u2014 backs him up so that Wei Ying is crowded against the countertop, Lan Zhan\u2019s other hand on his waistband, cupping his hip \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The kiss is earnest but sweet, wet and deep and imploring, Lan Zhan drawing Wei Ying\u2019s tongue into his mouth with his teeth and sucking on the tip of it lightly, almost a tease. Gentle, for now, let Wei Ying set the pace, what does Wei Ying want\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying jerks back from Lan Zhan with a small animal sound. A pulsing heat throbs in his chest like a trapped star. He can feel the blood in his face turning him crimson, his mouth stinging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares at Lan Zhan in open shock. Lan Zhan stares back at him, clearly a little bewildered by the intensity of his reaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That hadn\u2019t been. Angry, or punitive. That fantasy. There had been no trace of that sentiment in Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts, in those \u2014 <em> images, </em>and sensations. Lan Zhan had thought about kissing him with care behind each touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying can feel the trapped-star heat full body, through each of his limbs. He might actually be melting into the floor like candle wax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s expression shutters at whatever he sees on Wei Ying\u2019s face. Which \u2014 who the fuck even <em> knows </em>what that is. He\u2019s scared to know whatever his face is doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep well, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs without looking at him, then moves past him toward the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says hoarsely. When he hears the door nudge shut down the hall, he brings one hand to a blazing cheek, the other to touch his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sleep a fucking wink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying spends most of the evening staring into the dark cavern of Lan Zhan\u2019s ceiling. Straight-backed like a corpse, hands templed over his chest, tracking the occasional white checkering of passing headlights that glance off the walls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At one point, he twists onto one side, tucking himself into a curled position to get more comfortable; and then he flips back, wriggling down deeper into the poofy pouches of the air mattress wobbling under his weight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So. Here\u2019s the thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s been kissed before. He has <em> kissed people. </em>He has been the kisser and the kissee. He\u2019s always enjoyed it, too. But it\u2019s not like those kisses had ever meant anything. He\u2019s kissed most of his friends, strangers, even a few trivial crushes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares, unblinking, at the flickering lights of the city through the window-glass. For so long that his eyes start to deliberately unfocus, like a camera lens sliding out of alignment, the skyline fuzzing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never been kissed with even one ounce of the feeling in which Lan Zhan had imagined kissing him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rolls back onto his other side, the sheets tangling around his legs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The longer he thinks about it, the less it makes any sense. There\u2019s no reason that Lan Zhan should have a crush on him, not even one. Not with the way Wei Ying has treated him, and it\u2019s certainly not like their personalities mesh. Lan Zhan is, by <em> several </em>li, the most attractive person Wei Ying has ever encountered, so the idea that he would be even a little bit into him is...well, laughable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying flips onto his back, rubs his hands over his face. A crush is manageable. Crushes are fleeting, hormone-driven, often depthless. Wei Ying can handle being crushed on, as little sense as it might make in the first place coming from Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just has to keep Lan Zhan from falling for him any further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that that should be a difficult feat, given Wei Ying\u2019s...everything. Lan Zhan had hated him at one point, right? It shouldn\u2019t be hard to get there again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A tiny, very irritating voice pipes up that maybe he doesn\u2019t want to, which Wei Ying squashes under a proverbial boot heel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although he spends most of the night awake and turning, he must slip into unconsciousness at some point, because he soon finds himself blinking awake to a bright beam of sunlight across his face and the rich, sugary smell of fried dough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wriggles upward and casts wildly about for his surroundings, disoriented before he remembers where he is. When he does, he glances quickly over at Lan Zhan, who\u2019s already watching him from the kitchen table with a bag of takeout in one hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Ying replies. His brain is making that noise like a spoon stuck in the garbage disposal. Partially due to sleep loss, moreso due to the fact that the last sense-memory he has of Lan Zhan is where they\u2019d been \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Lan Zhan asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying must look like a complete wreck to warrant the question. He self-consciously shuffles a hand through his porcupined hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying lies. \u201cThanks for letting me stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan simply inclines his head and begins to unpack breakfast onto the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to get me anything,\u201d Wei Ying protests even as he shuffles over to the table, his stomach gurgling loudly. Unable to contain his curiosity, he starts to poke around the dishes, fully prepared to criticize Lan Zhan\u2019s taste before he realizes there\u2019s no need \u2014 he\u2019d picked up da bing and youtiao, as well as doujiang and ci fan gao. So, pretty much an array of Wei Ying\u2019s favorite breakfast foods that he\u2019s usually too lazy or running too late to pick up before work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis looks,\u201d Wei Ying says, \u201cincredible. Where did you go for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNext door,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cThere were casualties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying feels his eyebrows shoot up in interest. \u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is how Wei Ying discovers that, every single morning at 5am sharp, Lan Zhan walks down to the stall across the street to fight some elderly people for the freshest breakfast food before it sells out. Wei Ying laughs himself to death at the mental image of it \u2014 of <em> Lan Zhan</em>, of all people, engaged in passive-aggressive warfare with the local geriatric community.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I appreciate their sacrifice,\u201d Wei Ying says, when he finally stops laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s for a good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and scoots a plate over to Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nearly inhales his breakfast, stuffing himself so full that his stomach starts to hurt. Lan Zhan barely touches any of the food, which makes Wei Ying prickle with guilt, but overall he feels much brighter than he has in a while. Usually mornings are a boring and unwanted affair, something he slogs through to get himself to work on time, but there\u2019s something refreshing about eating breakfast with another person. About starting the day with someone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus, Lan Zhan might actually be? Funny? It doesn\u2019t seem like it should be possible, but he\u2019s keeping tabs on what could be another potential startling development for the week.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s apartment is located close to a subway stop, so they agree to leg it rather than driving in morning traffic. On the way out the door, Lan Zhan hands him one of the small plastic tubs from his refrigerator. Wei Ying stares at it in incomprehension.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor lunch,\u201d Lan Zhan says, in response to the unspoken question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wei Ying stammers. He reaches out to take the container, careful that their fingers don\u2019t brush. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should eat during the day,\u201d Lan Zhan says, with undisguised reproach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, I eat!\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cBut still, um, thanks.\u201d More quickly, he adds, \u201cI owe you one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns at him. \u201cFor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor letting me stay,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cFor making me meals. For <em> paying </em>for my meals. It\u2019s really not \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s response is measured, patient. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying says. He kind of wants to crawl out of his own skin. \u201cAs long as. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last time someone had actually cooked a meal for him, it had been his jie. He\u2019s not really sure how to cope with such charity from someone outside his family, even though it had clearly been no great ordeal for Lan Zhan to prep an extra meal for him. Wei Ying will make it up to him somehow anyway, maybe with lunch or something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They head out. The subway ride is quick and painless, although each car is jampacked for the morning commute. Wei Ying takes public transit to get around all the time, given he doesn\u2019t own a car and only ever borrows Jiang Cheng\u2019s, but tagging alongside Lan Zhan for it is certainly a new experience. He notices a couple of key differences right away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first is that people <em>stare.</em> Age, gender, fashion demographic \u2014 no categorization seems to be a discriminating factor for who\u2019s ogling Lan Zhan. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t even seem to notice \u2014\u00a0or if he does, he\u2019s well-practiced in acting aloof about it \u2014 but Wei Ying certainly does. It\u2019s like people\u2019s attention deflects right off of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other is that the berth of personal space around the two of them widens compared to when Wei Ying commutes alone. Whether it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s too intimidating or too beautiful, people unconsciously maneuver to stay out of Lan Zhan\u2019s way. Wei Ying reminds himself to instruct Huaisang that <em> this </em>is, in fact, hot privilege in action.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After watching one older lady stare at Lan Zhan with unadorned longing in their subway car, Wei Ying finally asks him, \u201cDoes it ever go to your head, all of these people looking at you all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns his head as he speaks; Lan Zhan is already watching him closely, nearer than Wei Ying expected. Wei Ying has been mindful to keep space between them, especially since last night, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to keep from jostling into each other with the subway as crowded as it is. The jolts are quick enough that he can\u2019t pick up anything coherent from Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts, but the effect is still disconcerting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan is answering his question. \u201cI don\u2019t notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives a little scoff of disbelief, unable to keep from teasing him. \u201cYou\u2019re just so used to everyone\u2019s adoration and attention all the time? Is that it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The subway hits a bump and Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder knocks into Lan Zhan\u2019s, just as Lan Zhan thinks, <em> Not everyone\u2019s. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rights himself quickly and clings onto the pole, leaning his body back from Lan Zhan\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he should find a random person to have sex with. He contemplates the idea a little morosely. It would be uncomfortable and probably unpleasant, but then at least <em> this </em>problem would be abated. Then he could at least stop unconsciously violating everyone\u2019s privacy, over and over again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The walk to their workplace off the stop is quick, and the moment they\u2019re in the door, Nie Mingjue intercepts them, Huaisang lingering just behind. Over his brother\u2019s shoulder, Huaisang raises one delicate eyebrow at Wei Ying and Lan Zhan\u2019s joined entry, and Wei Ying makes a face at him in return.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 the case in Jiaxing,\u201d Nie Mingjue is saying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan inclines his head slightly. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Wei Ying says, because clearly he\u2019d missed something. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nie Mingjue glances at him with a trace of impatience. \u201cThe gui in Jiaxing. We received a call this morning reporting heightened activity. You and Lan Zhan have been assigned to investigate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying immediately perks up at the thought of being in the field. It\u2019s the fun part of his job, and far preferable to being stuck in the office all day. It\u2019ll mean yet another day of tiptoeing around Lan Zhan, trying to avoid thoughts of \u2014 kissing in kitchens, or getting tied up and whatnot, but they\u2019ll be focused on work, so it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Nie Mingjue says, but the words are directed only to Wei Ying, his dark stare boring into him with intention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying mutters a thanks and doesn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The place they\u2019re going isn\u2019t reachable by subway, so Nie Mingjue hands the keys to one of their work rentals to Lan Zhan, which \u2014 why is it the implicit assumption that Lan Zhan should drive? It\u2019s a little insulting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s absolutely the correct call \u2014 Wei Ying\u2019s driving has been likened to a heart attack on wheels \u2014 but it would be nice to be <em> asked. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once Lan Zhan has the keys, they turn and head right back out the door, back to the elevator. They both reach for the button at the same time, their hands colliding, and Lan Zhan\u2019s voice fills his head, low and familiar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It\u2019s good I will be with him, </em> he\u2019s thinking. <em> So I can ensure that nothing happens to\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not helpless, you know,\u201d Wei Ying blurts out, turning toward Lan Zhan before he knows what he\u2019s saying. The words come out irritated, almost hostile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s answering stare is blank, maybe confused. The elevator dings and spreads its doors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re inside, Wei Ying shifts from foot to foot, restless to be on the move. He feels like a prickly cat, like all of his hackles are up. Nie Mingjue already babies him on case assignments because of \u2014 well. It\u2019s whatever, but he doesn\u2019t need it from Lan Zhan too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Lan Zhan says eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Ying says. He fixes his attention to a greasy thumbprint smear on the elevator door. \u201cIt\u2019s just that. I am capable of looking after myself, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t say anything in response, maybe wary of annoying Wei Ying further. Which, it\u2019s not like he\u2019d meant to be a dick about it. The outburst probably seems nonsensical to Lan Zhan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is...Wei Ying has this restless urge to prove himself to everyone at the firm. Lan Zhan most of all, given their history, given Lan Zhan\u2019s opinion of him up until now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to be coddled, anyway. He does fine on his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drive to Jiaxing is long and mostly quiet. Wei Ying would usually take the time to annoy Lan Zhan, provided a confined space and two hours to kill, but the lack of sleep is starting to catch up to him a little, so he dozes in fits while Lan Zhan tunes in to some classical radio station. He really is like an old man in a hot young guy\u2019s body, Wei Ying thinks, watching him blearily with his cheek smashed against the window. Lan Zhan is relaxed when he drives, at ease in spite of the traffic and symphony of blaring horns. The sleeves of his pressed shirt are rolled up to his elbow, one hand on his knee \u2014 the one with the expensive watch \u2014 and he taps his fingers lightly against the wheel with the music.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite the whole fuddy-duddy geezer thing, Wei Ying has discovered that the more time he spends with Lan Zhan, the less boring he seems. He finds himself curious about aspects of Lan Zhan\u2019s life that he\u2019d never bothered to consider before \u2014 where he\u2019d grown up, if he\u2019s close to his brother still, what his parents are like, if he plans to return to his family\u2019s practice after he gets sick of working for Nie Mingjue. And also more personal details that he has no business asking: Has Lan Zhan dated someone before? Has he had sex before? Has he even <em> kissed </em> someone? It would have seemed impossible, a few days ago, that the answer to any of those questions would be <em> yes, </em> but now Wei Ying has witnessed firsthand the prowess of Lan Zhan\u2019s...colorful imagination. What if it\u2019s based on experience?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying finds himself deeply rankled by the thought. Does Lan Zhan go around fantasizing like that about every pretty boy he meets? Maybe he\u2019s a secret sex fiend. Maybe he has a fetish for oblivious straight guys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and finally turns to look at him with the barest arch of an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying props himself up on an elbow, more alert at having Lan Zhan\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were looking at me,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cWhich you rarely do. You seemed as though you had a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always looking at you,\u201d Wei Ying says just to be contrary, before he really processes what he\u2019s saying. He freezes up a little, because that\u2019s exactly the kind of thing he\u2019s <em> not </em>supposed to say to someone he\u2019s trying to dissuade from having a crush on him, but Lan Zhan gives a tiny, dismissive shake of his head, like he thinks Wei Ying\u2019s messing with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBossy,\u201d Wei Ying mutters. \u201cFine, I was wondering about your life. I realized yesterday that I don\u2019t really know much about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know more than most people,\u201d Lan Zhan replies, \u201cI would wager. What happened yesterday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You took me on a whole-ass birthday date? </em>is what Wei Ying wants to say, but he wisely abstains. What he\u2019d said about not knowing much about Lan Zhan is true \u2014 Lan Zhan is apparently a walking repository for obscure information about Wei Ying, and Wei Ying doesn\u2019t even know Lan Zhan\u2019s favorite color or what TV shows he likes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, just when we were hanging out,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cWhen we talked about being friends. I feel like if we\u2019re friends, I should know more about your life. Like, um, what are your parents like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDead,\u201d Lan Zhan says, with absolutely no trace of humor. Well. Actually, maybe a little humor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth pops open, then shuts again. Usually <em> he\u2019s </em> the one to make flippant dead parent jokes to people. He now realizes that being on the receiving end is not as fun as being the arbiter of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSame!\u201d Wei Ying says, obnoxiously bright. \u201cWow, we have so much in common.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hums, then says, \u201cHow was your birthday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Wei Ying says, souring at the change in subject. \u201cYou mean other than getting temporarily evicted by my brother? I honestly don\u2019t really remember most of it, so. Good, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Come to think of it...the more he reflects on the day, the more he realizes that dinner with Lan Zhan had actually been the highlight of that entire event. The revelation makes him feel a little funny in a way he can\u2019t articulate. It\u2019s just unexpected, is all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t show up,\u201d Wei Ying remembers, then juts his lower lip in a pout when Lan Zhan glances over to appraise him. \u201cVery hurtful, gege.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine my company would be valuable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, that\u2019s. That\u2019s a little sad. And also \u2014 not even accurate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s dumb,\u201d Wei Ying protests, without any trace of teasing. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked having you there. You\u2019re fun to be around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFun,\u201d Lan Zhan echoes, flat and skeptical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying insists, and he realizes, as he says it, that he really means it. Lan Zhan <em> is </em> fun. In a weird, droll, offbeat kind of way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, pressing his lips tight together, and Wei Ying notices his ears are a little rosy, and then he realizes he\u2019s also a little flustered, just from doling out compliments. He returns to staring out the window, his cheek warm against the cool glass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did we get back to talking about me, anyway?\u201d Wei Ying asks. \u201cI was asking about <em> your </em>life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one, outside of work,\u201d Lan Zhan answers. \u201cAnd we have arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying scrambles up in his seat in surprise, then peers out the windshield. They <em> have </em>fully stopped \u2014 Wei Ying had assumed they were at a traffic light. Lan Zhan\u2019s already unbuckling his seatbelt, pushing his shoulder against the door to exit the car without another word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d Wei Ying calls after him, then follows suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The site of the haunting, for this specific case, is a local hotel. According to Wei Ying\u2019s reports, the place had shut down a couple months ago due to heightened resentful activity that had been physically terrorizing guests. Even though management had failed to exorcise the creature, construction had \u2014 for reasons unknown \u2014 started up again in an attempt to renovate the deserted building. Their firm had been called in after a worker was flung from a third-story window last week.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Never a dull moment, in this line of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan waits for him at the entrance, his guqin already tucked under one arm, while Wei Ying fishes around in his bag and pulls out his gear to set up. He nods at the contraption Wei Ying is messing with. \u201cWhat is that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks up at him with his mouth slightly open, pausing in where he\u2019s fiddling with a speaker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, a new thingy I made,\u201d he says. \u201cI used an old cell phone and wired it with resentment-detection technology, then I recorded different songs on flute.\u201d He plays one of them on the phone, a song of rest, and it trills through the speaker. \u201cAllows me to keep my hands freer to work, and also, this little chart replicates a thermal map that tells me where resentment is strongest, kind of like a metal detector. Then based on the level of resentment in an area, the tech auto-plays the appropriate song. Neat, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan observes him impassively for another moment before he notes, \u201cClever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying preens. \u201cI know. Thanks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What he doesn\u2019t say is that he\u2019s not fucking around with new cultivator tech for fun; that it\u2019s become a necessity, by this point, to stay safe on cases. But that\u2019s nothing Lan Zhan needs to know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVery clever,\u201d Lan Zhan adds. \u201cYou could sell that technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. He could, couldn\u2019t he? He hasn\u2019t really thought about it before. Cultivator tech firms already exist, but Wei Ying usually forgoes their products; it\u2019s easier to make his own stuff, based on his own individual preferences.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you really shouldn\u2019t flirt with me on cases,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very distracting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan flares him a look that\u2019s not quite exasperated, but enough to let Wei Ying know that he\u2019s pushing his limits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and together, they enter the hotel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying feels the energy ripple the moment he steps foot through the door, pricking the hair on his arms. Powerful resentment always leaves an ashy taste in his mouth, like wildfire smoke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNie Mingjue said this was a category 3 gui?\u201d Wei Ying murmurs in a low voice, picking his way around a shattered ceiling light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He must detect something in Wei Ying\u2019s tone, because he adds, not quite a question, \u201cYou disagree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCategorization could be wrong,\u201d Wei Ying says, checking the thermal map on his device. The entire room is awash in blue and green. \u201cThe energy here feels stronger than that. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cStay close.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The temperature creeps down and down as they pick their way through the ruined building. Most of the windows have been blown out, the glass shattered on the outside. Like something from inside the building had punched them out. More broken glass pops under the soles of Wei Ying\u2019s shoes, crunches and grinds in the thick silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying follows the map on his phone to the lobby, Lan Zhan tailing close behind him. The moment they enter the opened space, chills ripple up the back of Wei Ying\u2019s neck. A powerful feeling of dread descends over him, a terror that\u2019s reactive, instinctive. Alongside that primal fear, he finds himself teeming with sudden bitterness and fury, swirling around inside him in a maelstrom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can manipulate emotions,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, closing his eyes in concentration. \u201c<em>Wow, </em>it\u2019s strong. Can you feel it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan draws close to Wei Ying\u2019s side, his fingers tightening over the strings of Wangji. \u201cStay alert.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying feels the movement in his periphery before he sees it, a darkness from that shadows that solidifies and takes shape, unspools wider and wider. He whirls in its direction just as a heightened song of rest bursts from his speaker, Lan Zhan\u2019s music immediately striking up to accompany it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The creature swarms with shadows, expanding in Wei Ying\u2019s line of sight; its eyes are hollow red sockets, and its mouth gapes with teeth and foam. A low rattle emanates from its center, a ticking growl. Its hatred thickens in the air, as solid as a knife.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a big boy,\u201d Wei Ying says inanely, suddenly swamped by nerves, because \u2014 they\u2019ve definitely been accidentally thrown into a category 1 case, and that is definitely a yangui.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He switches the song on his device, the strongest song of exorcism in his arsenal, and the creature reacts at once with fury. It rears up and screams, more shadows unfurling from its dark mass into long sheaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of the shadows spears toward Wei Ying, quicker than a blink, and he feels Lan Zhan\u2019s hand on his shoulder, his voice suddenly everywhere in his ears, the loudest thing in the room, <em> Don\u2019t touch him </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he can react, the darkness knifes right through Wei Ying, into his lower abdomen \u2014 it had aimed for his core, the cunning fucker, but of course it had missed its target, it had hit the wrong side. He hears Lan Zhan yell his name, and he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in his head or outside of it, but the ground rises to meet him as he sinks to his knees, blood dribbling from his mouth, coppery in his throat \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the dark recedes, Wei Ying finds that he\u2019s horizontal, the ceiling skewed at the wrong angle. Sensation, or observation of sensation, trickles back through him like the tingle of bloodflood to a dormant limb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a grip on him so tight that its discomfort is primary, singular. Then the heartbeat-thud of a name in his ears, over and over and over \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wei Ying Wei Ying Wei Ying Wei Ying </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight here,\u201d he mumbles, reaching up with closed eyes to pat Lan Zhan\u2019s chest. His mouth is clumsy and slow, tripping its way into the shapes of words. \u201cWhat\u2019re you calling me for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d The air cracks around Lan Zhan\u2019s spoken voice, a footfall on a splintering sheet of ice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wei Ying, hurt, hurt, hurting, my fault, my fault my fault my fault\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShhhhh,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, winces. It isn\u2019t like Lan Zhan to be so loud. His head is an echo chamber, Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts and his own rolling over each other in a senseless din of sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lobby has gone silent around them, the resentment dissipated; Lan Zhan must have finished the thing off by himself, because his cultivation talent is unmatched and Wei Ying is \u2014 useless, deadweight \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The elevation shifts under Wei Ying, the ground falling away; the hard lines of Lan Zhan\u2019s forearms digging into the tender skin of Wei Ying\u2019s ribs, his weight ricketing against Lan Zhan\u2019s limbs uncomfortably as he\u2019s carried, but it\u2019s nice to be held firm, to be held in place by something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh, </em> he thinks, <em> all of my bones feel bruised. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh, </em> he thinks, <em> Lan Zhan was worried \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Awareness slides away from him, a tilt downward into dark shallows; he\u2019s dimly aware of movement and sound as though through a thick curtain, and when he comes to, it takes a moment for his surroundings to realign, for familiarity to settle in, sluggish and layered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s back in his apartment, the sheets damp beneath him with (hopefully) sweat. A chill has buried itself at the root of him, spreading outward like ice crystallizing on a pane. He\u2019s shivering uncontrollably, his teeth knocking together, and Lan Zhan is there, a hallucinatory figment, dabbing sweat away from his brow with hushed murmurs, the tides of sound overlapping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He passes out again, and when he wakes, more clear-headed and far warmer than before, Lan Zhan is still there, solid and real. He\u2019s propped at the foot of Wei Ying\u2019s mattress with his back pressed at an uncomfortable angle against the wall; his guqin is resting next to Wei Ying\u2019s mattress. He\u2019s still wearing his work clothes, his dress-shirt bunched up awkwardly around his shoulders and forearms. His arms are crossed, his eyes screwed shut \u2014 he is asleep, at least partially, but not restfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying observes him for a long moment, turning over the improbability of Lan Zhan\u2019s physical presence in his home. In his bed. So strangely incongruous. Then he nudges Lan Zhan with his socked big toe and murmurs, \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan jolts awake at once, his bleary eyes finding Wei Ying\u2019s, and then he shifts off the mattress, moving back to Wei Ying\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe yangui,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods. \u201cMn. Our combined music was enough to exorcise it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is Lan Zhan trying to give him face? Wei Ying hadn\u2019t done anything except make them both a liability. He turns his face toward the wall, closing his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still here,\u201d Wei Ying rasps. His throat is so dry, cracking and arid. \u201cHow did we get in? Where\u2019s Jiang Cheng?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Lan Zhan answers. \u201cI found the entry code in your phone. Jiang Cheng must have changed it back before he left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah, Jiang Cheng had likely gone to visit the Jiangs for the week. Probably for the best that he doesn\u2019t know about this whole fiasco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan grips Wei Ying\u2019s elbow, helps him sit up as he passes a sweating glass of water into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Thank god he\u2019s awake, </em> Lan Zhan is thinking.<em>\u00a0It doesn\u2019t bear thinking if \u2014 what would I have done if </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Lan Zhan who moves away, standing to stride quickly toward the kitchen. The rupture leaves Wei Ying strangely bereft, wondering what the rest of that sentence might have been.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ran a high fever,\u201d Lan Zhan says when he returns, and presses a cold rag to Wei Ying\u2019s forehead. The crispness of it is an immediate balm against his clammy skin, and Wei Ying sighs, closes his eyes. Tries to shelve away the guilt, the low-simmering embarrassment of his predicament.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always been Wei Ying who\u2019s been the rag-bearer, the mopper of foreheads and changer of sheets and vomit-hair-holder. His immune system had been uncannily formidable as a kid, but Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng had caught sick all of the time. It had been his jie who cared for him, the one time he can remember seriously falling ill.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, Wei Ying had never gotten sick often. Not before. Now, it\u2019s become much more common, this weakness of his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe yangui impacted your core,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and he settles into a cross-legged position by Wei Ying\u2019s bedside. \u201cI suggested a doctor, but Nie Mingjue said you would recover so long as I provided spiritual energy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying grimaces and gulps another long sip of water. Nie Mingjue is the only other person besides his family who knows the truth, so his recommendation makes sense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says. Quiet, a little hesitant. \u201cThe blow you took. It had a significant impact on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives a resigned nod. He can sense the question that Lan Zhan is implicitly asking but won\u2019t outright \u2014 a question that Wei Ying is going to answer, because for whatever reason, he actually wants to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I tell you something,\u201d Wei Ying says, his voice still rusty. It fissures in two places. \u201cWill you promise not to think less of me for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shifts forward to flip the rag on Wei Ying\u2019s forehead, his fingers against Wei Ying\u2019s overwarm skin, and thinks, <em> I could never, not for anything. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, and he hadn\u2019t meant to say that out loud, it just\u00a0\u2014 the sound just sort of escapes him, involuntary and airless, like he\u2019d been kicked in the ribs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and moves his hands away. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying closes his eyes and licks at his cracked lips. His face is still feverishly warm, moreso from Lan Zhan than the sickness now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it short,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m sure you are, too.\u201d He takes a deep breath, holds it in the deepest places of his lungs. \u201cA few years back, right out of school, Jiang Cheng and I worked a case just like this one. A very similar thing happened, only the yangui was immensely more powerful. The fuck-up was on me; I wasn\u2019t covering Jiang Cheng\u2019s back like I should have, and he got caught in the line of fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes, amber in the lone lamplight, sear into his, steady and intent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing destroyed half of his core,\u201d Wei Ying says, and his eyes flutter shut again. \u201cThe damage was irreparable; it meant Jiang Cheng would never advance beyond his current position. But if I could...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan says suddenly, like the pieces have at last slotted into place. His inhale is sharp, his voice strangely small. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 it was only fair, right?\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cIt was my fault that it happened in the first place. I said I would keep it short, so \u2014 yeah, I donated half my core. It was enough so that Jiang Cheng could continue his career, and I wouldn\u2019t entirely lose mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A shadow has fallen across Lan Zhan\u2019s face, the looming stillness of a thunderhead in a windless sky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Cheng agreed to this,\u201d Lan Zhan says. His voice is toneless, each word deliberately placed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d Wei Ying is quick to say. \u201cHe put up a fight about it, he\u2019s got such a fucking pride. But in the end, his parents and I managed to persuade him into it. The prospect of losing his purpose, his job, his <em> life, </em>it was \u2014 it was enough to get him to agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he still changes the locks,\u201d Lan Zhan says. Still in that same voice, curiously detached.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well, I mean.\u201d Wei Ying winces and squirms. The sheets are uncomfortably sticky against his skin from where he\u2019s sweated through them. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re still brothers, right? We fight like any other siblings. But at least we still talk. We\u2019re still <em> friends. </em>Yu-ayi stopped speaking to me after the case happened, even after the procedure.\u201d He winces and laughs, but the sound is too sharp for humor, too brittle. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m no longer welcome in the Jiang household.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales, slow through his teeth. Halfway, there\u2019s a hitch, the smallest tremor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did not deserve that,\u201d Lan Zhan says. His eyes are eclipsed from view, his features shadow-cast. Wei Ying itches to reach out and touch. He\u2019s become so strangely accustomed, even in this short time, to hearing what Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking behind the veil of his silences, between his sparse words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the longer this predicament goes on, the more each touch feels like a gross invasion of privacy. It had felt kind of like a joke before, or at least nothing too serious if he happened to pick up on Lan Zhan\u2019s inner monologue. Things had changed. Surprisingly quickly. From the deepest part of him, Wei Ying doesn\u2019t want to take advantage of this person, not ever, not even inadvertently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about deserve,\u201d Wei Ying says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s about debts owed. The Jiangs adopted me when my parents died; the means and education they provided are the only reason I learned cultivation at all. Jiang Cheng wouldn\u2019t have lost half of his core in the first place if it weren\u2019t for me. This was a fair repayment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head and says nothing, and an unbroken silence follows for several minutes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had said \u2014 had thought to himself \u2014\u00a0just moments before that he wouldn\u2019t think less of Wei Ying for anything. But faced with Lan Zhan\u2019s stormy, unreadable expression, a knot of anxiety tightens in Wei Ying\u2019s chest. Lan Zhan is orthodox in his cultivation methods, after all, arguably to a fault. Maybe this \u2014 maybe this really did cross a line.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay something,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, and licks his lips again. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes another moment before he replies. There\u2019s a creak as he shifts his weight on a floorboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is remarkable that you have half a core and still cultivate with the skill that you do,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks once, twice. Lan Zhan has never complimented him. Ever. Not out loud, at least. Wei Ying swallows around the bubble of heat that rises in his throat. He had grown so used to Lan Zhan\u2019s perceived disdain of him that he has no idea what to do, recently, with the inverse of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being nice to me now because I\u2019m an invalid,\u201d Wei Ying complains, a little weak-sounding, but he\u2019s suddenly desperate for levity, to decompress the heaviness that crowds thicker and thicker between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives a single shake of his head, as though impatient, and then he says, \u201cRest, Wei Ying.\u201d He looks tired, more tired than Wei Ying has ever seen him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should rest too,\u201d Wei Ying whispers. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He hesitates, then trips out, before he loses the nerve, \u201cLan Zhan, will you. Would you \u2014 are you going to stay here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels like a small child for asking, helpless and unforgivably needy, but it\u2019s been a long time since anyone has been there at his side when he\u2019s woken up. No one has ever...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says with a resolute nod. \u201cI will be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying relaxes, sinking back into the pillows and closing his eyes with a soft exhale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s, ah, a sleeping bag in the closet, or \u2014\u201d He swallows, blames his own fever-wrought delirium, and continues, much more rushed, \u201c \u2014 or I know my bed isn\u2019t even really a bed, and it\u2019s small and kind of gross because I\u2019ve been fever-sweating all over it but we could share, only if you want to, only if you didn\u2019t want to sleep on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t dare open his eyes, afraid of whatever expression Lan Zhan is wearing. The answering silence is a wall, impossible to decrypt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> What are you thinking? </em> Wei Ying is suddenly desperate to know. <em> Tell me what you\u2019re thinking. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sleeping bag will suffice,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and gets up from the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods and stifles the bizarre stab of disappointment he feels. Lying next to Lan Zhan so close, hearing his thoughts so unimpeded, it would be \u2014 terrifying, uncomfortable, wrong of him. Why is he disappointed?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know anything anymore, he\u2019s quickly come to realize.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, before Lan Zhan can turn away to hunt for the sleeping bag. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t say anything, but. The core thing, it\u2019s. It\u2019s kind of a family secret. Not even my jie knows. Only Nie Mingjue does, for the sake of my assignments and, you know, liability stuff. Please don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not,\u201d Lan Zhan says firmly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to baby me on cases, either,\u201d Wei Ying adds quickly. \u201cThis was just a weird one-off thing, I swear I can hold my own and I don\u2019t need \u2014 any kind of handicaps, or \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, gently enough not to be brusque. \u201cI think no less of you than before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying clenches his hands in and out of the blanket, his knuckles flexing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan crosses back toward him, the shuffling of his dress pants loud in the quiet, his socks shuffling in a quiet hush across the wood floors. He leans to pick up the glass by the mattress and passes it to Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Ying, he\u2019s \u2014 too selfish to pull back, too greedy. His guilt thickening, he lets their fingers brush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s voice rings out in his ears, steady and resolute. \u2014 <em> enough to tell me. I will protect him with my life, so long as I am by his side. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying inhales, ragged and too fast, and tucking the glass close to his chest, he rolls so that he\u2019s on his side, his back facing Lan Zhan. His heart is crashing drum-loud against the walls of his chest. It had probably looked weird to Lan Zhan, to turn away so quickly, but the reaction had possessed him, visceral and reflexive. He can\u2019t look at Lan Zhan\u2019s face right now, not without giving everything away, and he\u2019s afraid of whatever Lan Zhan might see on his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That had been. Too much. Very much. Wei Ying can take it when people are mean to him \u2014 he thrives on it, in fact. There\u2019s always something a little sexy-edged about meanness. But he flounders at niceness. It completely poleaxes him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying presses the cool glass of water to his burning cheek, careful not to spill it. He frantically wills his heart to slow as Lan Zhan moves away, off to search for something to sleep on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As his body calms down, he dozes briefly, then stirs long enough to listen to the sounds of Lan Zhan settling down beside his bed, the crinkle of a sleeping bag and Lan Zhan\u2019s breathing, and Wei Ying thinks, mostly unconscious, it\u2019s good he\u2019s close \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying wakes up, it takes him a moment to recognize Jiang Cheng by his bedside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng stirs a little in his chair when he sees Wei Ying awake, a frown already settling over his features.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying asks. It\u2019s the only question, for whatever reason, he can think to ask in the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gruff look on Jiang Cheng\u2019s face smoothes out into genuine concern. \u201cAre you concussed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks, still discombobulated. He\u2019s not sure, by the dim blue cast of the room, if it\u2019s morning or evening. \u201cHe...he said he would stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng huffs a derisive sound, then says, \u201cHe <em> was </em> annoyingly hard to get rid of. But I told him that he was the last person you\u2019d want to see when you woke up, so he beat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wriggles up into a half-sitting position, suddenly alert in his indignation. \u201cWhy the hell would you say that to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng\u2019s mouth hangs slightly ajar as he stares at Wei Ying. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s,\u201d Wei Ying says, then rubs a knuckle over his gritty eyelid. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Things are...different now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, okay. Why are we talking about Lan Zhan, anyway?\u201d Jiang Cheng gripes. \u201cIs that really all you have to say to me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is at once profoundly irritated. \u201cWhat else should I say to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A vein starts to throb in Jiang Cheng\u2019s forehead. \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know, maybe <em> sorry for almost dying</em>? <em> That was really fucking stupid of me, Jiang Cheng, I won\u2019t do it again</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry for that,\u201d Wei Ying says, petulant. \u201cAnd it will probably happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so,\u201d Jiang Cheng says through his teeth. Another bopping vein has joined the beat of the first, like a tiny EDM concert on his forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I even <em> bother </em> worrying about you when you\u2019re clearly so hell-bent on risking your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t so worried about me when you locked me out in the middle of the night,\u201d Wei Ying retorts. He\u2019s not usually one for petty snipes or grudges, but the grogginess is quickening his temper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. \u201cI\u2019m <em> sorry</em>, alright? I was fucking blackout, I wasn\u2019t exactly in control of my actions. It\u2019s not like I spent the entire next day trying to get a hold of your dead phone. Oh wait, <em> I did. </em>Where the hell have you been staying, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, mostly just to watch the art show of Jiang Cheng\u2019s face changing several different colors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d Jiang Cheng splutters. \u201c<em>Him</em>? Since when are you even friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan has always liked me very much, as it happens,\u201d Wei Ying says loftily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes. \u201cGod.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pauses, thinking for a moment, before he asks, \u201cHow did you know to come back? Weren\u2019t you with your parents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cI\u2019m your emergency contact, dumbass. Nie Mingjue called me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An awkward beat of silence falls between them. Jiang Cheng fidgets in the chair and shuffles his hands and legs, like he\u2019s deliberately trying to make noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-jie called you like a million times for your birthday, by the way,\u201d he says, after another stilted pause. \u201cYour phone was dead all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying says again. A small ache shivers in his chest at the thought of his sister. It\u2019s been so long, since he\u2019s gotten to see her in person. \u201cI\u2019ll, um, be sure to call her back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another strange stretch of silence unfolds; not as strained as before, but not quite comfortable, either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They could talk about what happened, but it would mean bringing up things they both refuse to acknowledge. Like a giant, jagged hole in a sunroof that they pick their way around. Wei Ying can sense that Jiang Cheng wants to grill him for details about the case, but \u2014 well, it\u2019s a moot point anyway. They both know how it ended and why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a good brother and I almost died,\u201d Wei Ying begins, with deliberately placed lightness. \u201cAny chance you can order takeout for us? It feels like my stomach is trying to digest itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. \u201cWhat do you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives him his order as the tension between them palpably settles, kicked dust returning to the earth. He and Jiang Cheng have always had that kind of relationship \u2014 vicious fights, nearly to blows, and then a quick smoothing-over, no words needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he leaves the room, Jiang Cheng shoves Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder once, rough and brief, but it\u2019s enough to catch the trailing end of his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> If anything really happened to this idiot, </em> Jiang Cheng thinks, <em> I\u2019d never forgive myself. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying ducks his head to hide his smile in the sleeve of his hoodie, and rolls out of bed to follow Jiang Cheng into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next afternoon when he arrives at work, Wei Ying almost crashes into Lan Zhan\u2019s desk, sending a small flurry of papers to the floor like an upset chicken coop. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks up at him from where he\u2019s buried in paperwork. Then he very pointedly moves his full cup of tea away from where Wei Ying had flailed into his space. \u201cWei Ying. How are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for whatever dumb shit Jiang Cheng said to you,\u201d Wei Ying rushes out, still out of breath from practically sprinting up four flights of stairs. (Elevator\u2019s out.) He can feel his suit jacket is rumpled and that there\u2019s sweat matted along his hairline, which really just. Adds to the entire aesthetic. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I thought maybe I \u2014 maybe we could \u2014 I could make it up to you with \u2014 do you want to get lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him with his mouth slightly parted, his eyes wide with surprise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shit, had that crossed a line? Wei Ying frets. He\u2019d rehearsed that spiel the entire way up and had somehow still vomited it at Lan Zhan\u2019s feet. Who the hell would want to go anywhere with him right now, anyway, when he\u2019s a damn mess \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Okay,\u201d Wei Ying echoes with a sharp, relieved exhale. \u201cOkay. Great. Cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just wrapping up a meeting,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and nods toward Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder in indication.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying spins around on his heel and is promptly greeted by \u2014 another Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, not Lan Zhan. A darker eye color, slightly different features, a little older-looking, more smile-lines, but still surreally, traffic-stopping handsome in the way only Lans can be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying says, once he recovers from the surprise. \u201cUh, hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brother, Lan Huan,\u201d Lan Zhan says from behind Wei Ying as he gets up from his chair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Ying says to Lan Huan again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Wei,\u201d Lan Huan says affably, then gives a slight bow. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where Lan Zhan exudes a perpetual aura of frost, Lan Huan is all summery warmth and effusive smiles. Like anyone within the immediate orbit of his attention could feel their company is desired. The contrast to Lan Zhan, given the similarity of their features, has an almost unnerving effect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying returns the greeting, and on reflex, he offers his hand to shake. Lan Huan takes it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2014 what A-Zhan sees in him, </em> Lan Huan thinks. His easy, effortless smile is still fixed in place, falling warm on Wei Ying like a shaft of sunlight. <em> If he hurts him, I will ensure there are consequences. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying yanks his hand back a little too abruptly. He stares at Lan Huan, wide-eyed. Lan Huan\u2019s inviting smile has not wavered in the slightest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Lans and the thickness of their public-facing personas, he thinks, are no joke. He\u2019s never seen anything quite like it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan-xiong,\u201d Nie Mingjue greets from behind them, and claps a friendly hand to Lan Huan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust on time, as always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see Nie-xiong,\u201d Lan Huan replies, then offers a close-lipped smile that still manages to be heartfelt. Wei Ying had already known the two were close friends \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much the only reason that the Nie firm had been able to poach Lan Zhan from his family\u2019s business, at least for the time being. The Lans run their own prestigious institute of musical cultivation, but to Wei Ying\u2019s understanding, Lan Zhan had wanted to spend some time in the field, and Nie Mingjue had eagerly agreed to enlist him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Nie Mingjue says, as he turns toward the two of them with his hand still on Lan Huan\u2019s bicep. \u201cYou\u2019ll deploy for the category 2 in Wuxi tomorrow. Li Mei will accompany you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he turns to smile at Lan Huan again, who reflects the look back at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tilts his chin up. \u201cWei Ying is with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A dead-zone silence follows these words. Both Nie Mingjue\u2019s and Lan Huan\u2019s smiles freeze in place, slowly cooling as Lan Zhan\u2019s words settle in. Wei Ying finds that he\u2019s holding his breath in his disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nie Mingjue\u2019s jaw clenches as he cuts a look to Wei Ying. \u201cWei Ying was just injured in the field. I won\u2019t put him on a case until he\u2019s fully recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is capable nonetheless,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. \u201cWei Ying will accompany me, or another cultivator can take the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan is staring at his younger brother as though he\u2019s seeing him for the first time and is uncertain of his impression. Nie Mingjue\u2019s mustache jumps left, then right as his mouth works, his face reddening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tense silence drags out. Some of their colleagues, shamelessly eavesdropping, are observing the exchange with round, interested eyes. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t budge, his gaze pinned coolly on Nie Mingjue. The setup of the situation is surprisingly underhanded, for what Wei Ying would expect of Lan Zhan. Anyone watching well knows that if Nie Mingjue takes Lan Zhan off the case in front of onlookers, it will cause Lan Huan, a close friend and business partner, to lose face.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Nie Mingjue breaks the silence, speaking through his teeth. \u201cVery well. As long as Wei Ying is familiar with the risks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods once, apparently satisfied, then turns to Wei Ying. \u201cLunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives three quick nods, then practically scrambles to tail Lan Zhan out of the office. He tries to ignore Nie Mingjue\u2019s and Lan Huan\u2019s stares burning into his back the entire way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, once they\u2019re out the doors. Strange patches of warmth keep flaring up in his chest in a firefly cadence, and he suspects it\u2019s not just the heartburn from chugging three cups of coffee this morning. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Lan Zhan says dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019re the most skilled cultivator in the firm. It is nonsensical to have someone else work the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hastens to catch up with Lan Zhan\u2019s pace, a little bounce in his step. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m blushing,\u201d he teases. \u201cWho knew you were such a flirt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says without looking at him. Wei Ying reaches out to \u2014 do something, to grab his shoulder or maybe bump their arms together, before he remembers himself and retreats. He shouldn\u2019t \u2014 do that now, with Lan Zhan, not knowing what he knows. It would be an unfair violation. He probably shouldn\u2019t tease him about flirting either, on second thought. He hadn\u2019t really considered that; he\u2019s never even had to think about it before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had indulged Wei Ying\u2019s preferences last time they\u2019d eaten together, so Wei Ying returns the favor and drags Lan Zhan to some mostly-vegetarian restaurant he\u2019d spotted the other day on his way home, right next to Jing\u2019an Temple. It\u2019s only a few li away from their office, not far from the place Wei Ying likes, and Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t put up a fight about following Wei Ying wherever, although he does appear a little surprised when they stop in front of the restaurant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Wei Ying asks, suddenly uncertain when he catches Lan Zhan\u2019s expression. \u201cI just, I know you don\u2019t eat meat \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks at him, his features thawing from where they\u2019d frozen into blank confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is excellent,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He still seems perplexed. \u201cWill you eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll find something,\u201d Wei Ying says with more confidence than he feels. His knowledge of healthy food is approaching absolute zero, but he does know that he likes plenty of vegetables, and there should be non-vegetarian stuff here anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and holds open the door for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they say chivalry is dead,\u201d Wei Ying says with a hum as he wriggles past him. He\u2019s careful that their skin doesn\u2019t touch. \u201cThanks, gege!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, as he usually does, but it sounds slightly. Off. A different note, a little choked, maybe a little longer and less curt than normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It gives Wei Ying pause, abruptly aware of himself in a way he\u2019s never been before. Had that also been flirty? If <em> that\u2019s </em> flirting, how long has Wei Ying been interacting with Lan Zhan that way and he hadn\u2019t realized? Does he even know how to <em> stop? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t sure he knows the answer to that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They go through the buffet line quickly, piling their plates with food before they pick one of the nearby tables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at all these plants on my plate, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying is complaining good-naturedly as he takes up one of the spots. \u201cLook at how healthy you\u2019ve made me. Next up I\u2019m going to open a community garden.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hums and joins him at the table. As he slides into the chair, their ankles knock together, and on reflex, Wei Ying braces himself for what comes next, nearly recoiling \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The scene that strikes him is brief but vivid, dripping with the saturated color of a dreamscape. He sees himself in a small garden, barefoot in the loose earth with his clothes rucked up to his elbows and knees. He\u2019s turning to beam at Lan Zhan with all of his teeth, a white comet in the midday sunlight. He has a silly sunhat on, something he\u2019d probably never wear in real life. There\u2019s a streak of dried mud across his cheek, and his arms are overflowing with a crop of plants and vegetables. His skin is summer-bronze and flushed from the sun, and his face gleams with sweat and grime from a hard day\u2019s work but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter, because Wei Ying watches himself bound toward Lan Zhan until he falls laughing into a pair of arms, and the arms catch him and hold him fast, vegetables and all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes the image away like he\u2019s blinking sun out of his eyes. An odd feeling, a dull throb like a bruise, spreads and spreads in his chest until the ache takes root in him. Lan Zhan isn\u2019t looking at him, the fall of his lashes fluttering minutely as he eats his lunch, but for the first time, Wei Ying finds that he \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stop staring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It strikes him suddenly, as perhaps it should have earlier, that there hasn\u2019t been a single instance, since he gained this ability, where Lan Zhan has wished him ill. Wei Ying hasn\u2019t detected even a trace of resentment or grudge-bearing or even irritation in Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts, as he had imagined all of these years. Wei Ying has always thought that if Lan Zhan ever found out the truth about his core, his opinion of Wei Ying would be irreversibly tainted, but \u2014 that hasn\u2019t been the case at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan fantasizes about seeing him happy. Lan Zhan fantasizes about them <em> gardening </em>together. The bruise burrows deeper until it pinches, until Wei Ying almost puts a hand to his chest to massage away the strange sensation around his heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had known, pretty quickly after gaining his magic, that Lan Zhan was a decent person. He\u2019s starting to realize, even more quickly, that Lan Zhan may be the best person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until very recently, Wei Ying might have resented this discovery \u2014 <em> of course </em>perfect Lan Zhan is actually, underneath it all, not a sullen and mean person as he\u2019d once thought. But he doesn\u2019t feel that way anymore. He almost feels like...he\u2019s lucky to be liked by a person this good. Because it ostensibly must mean that, even if just a little bit, he might also be good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Zhan asks, tugging him from his thoughts. He stares across the table at Wei Ying, his chopsticks suspended mid-air. His gaze points to Wei Ying\u2019s untouched meal. \u201cIs it good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks a little. Then he smiles. \u201cYeah. It is good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next couple weeks go by quickly, and they\u2019re weird. Weird for the mind-reading that persists \u2014 even <em> weirder </em>for how normal it\u2019s quickly become, a low-humming backdrop of Wei Ying\u2019s day-to-day that he only selectively pays attention to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weirdest, for how quickly consumed he becomes with spending every second with Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Lan Zhan questions Wei Ying\u2019s sudden desire for his company, he doesn\u2019t vocalize it. He seems content to follow whatever Wei Ying wants to do, whether it\u2019s dragging him to boba or to a nearby park on the weekend. They get lunch together almost every day at work, and the eyes and whispers of their colleagues incredulously follow their sudden camaraderie. Huaisang is downright baffled by it, but he seems to decide it\u2019s wise not to pry into it. At least, not too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, like. Fucking him, right?\u201d Huaisang asks Wei Ying on a Wednesday, out of the blue. \u201cJust wanted to make sure that\u2019s still the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill straight, Nie-xiong,\u201d Wei Ying informs him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it two weeks,\u201d says Huaisang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The following night, Wei Ying brings over some Nintendo games and takeout to Lan Zhan\u2019s place, because Lan Zhan had recently made the outrageous claim that although he\u2019s nearly thirty years old, he\u2019s somehow never played MarioKart before. It doesn\u2019t seem like it should be possible, and Wei Ying suspects he might be getting hustled, especially when Lan Zhan beats him after the first couple rounds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you good at everything,\u201d Wei Ying complains as he pouts at his second place star. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a flaw in and of itself to be good at everything, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan settles his shoulders deeper into the cushions of the couch. \u201cI am not good at everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cName one thing you\u2019re not good at,\u201d Wei Ying says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pauses to think about it for a moment, before he allows, \u201cDrinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrinking isn\u2019t a skill!\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cExcept in my case, because I\u2019m very good at it. Lan Zhan, tell me you\u2019re bad at volleyball or something to appease me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am bad at volleyball,\u201d Lan Zhan says, completely unconvincing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sulks at him. \u201cOkay, you can add <em> lying </em>to that growing list of things you\u2019re bad at.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth tilts up on one end, not quite a smile but close. He\u2019s wearing some old, threadbare sweater that still somehow manages to look like a fashion statement, given his built physique and stupidly perfect face. More and more, Wei Ying has gotten to see Lan Zhan out of business clothes \u2014 which makes sense, given how much they\u2019re hanging out outside of work now. Wei Ying has been careful with his touches, cautious to protect Lan Zhan\u2019s privacy where he can. The less he hears of Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts, the more he can pretend that this whole \u2014 crush situation doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The helpless fact of the matter is that Wei Ying actually likes Lan Zhan. As in, <em> somehow </em>along the way, has started enjoying his company and actively looking forward to it. Lan Zhan is funny and decent and a good listener and weirdly fun, open to doing whatever spontaneous thing Wei Ying wants to do. He\u2019s changed a lot from their early days at university, and Wei Ying feels a little abashed he\u2019d clung onto a singular idea of him for so long. He\u2019s really been missing out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, Wei Ying is a tactile person by nature. It\u2019s hard for him not to touch, to push and tease and shove and worm himself into Lan Zhan\u2019s personal space. It starts to feel more and more like a chore to keep himself distant, to shy away from Lan Zhan\u2019s rare touches, whenever they come.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tonight, though, he pushes his limits. Maybe it\u2019s something about the casual, relaxed ease between them, teasing each other back and forth. Maybe it\u2019s the jar of Emperor\u2019s Smile. Either way, for the next round of the game, Wei Ying puts his socked feet in Lan Zhan\u2019s lap, like it\u2019s a joke or something, but he doesn\u2019t move away, and neither does Lan Zhan, so he keeps them there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the countdown to the race begins, and Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking about \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014 <em> Wei Ying kneeling between Lan Zhan\u2019s thighs, swallowing his cock with a dreamy, faraway expression while Lan Zhan focuses on the game. Every so often, he would thread a hand through Wei Ying\u2019s hair, to ground him or as an encouragement, but for the most part, he would focus on playing, on keeping up an act of idle indifference even as Wei Ying whined for his attention, working hard to make it good for him. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Finally, when he\u2019s close enough, Lan Zhan would pull Wei Ying\u2019s mouth off of him by his hair; Wei Ying would make a whimpered sound of protest that quiets as Lan Zhan strokes himself three times and comes, all over his face. Wei Ying would open his mouth to catch some of it, his eyes closed and his cheeks flushed. He would look so good like this, heart-stopping \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan would pull Wei Ying up into his lap then, make him wait for it until Lan Zhan\u2019s hard again even if he begs and squirms. If he\u2019s good enough, he\u2019d put Wei Ying on his cock and let him ride it like he wants. (After some reflection, he\u2019s concluded that Wei Ying is probably the type that can come untouched, that can get off without a hand on him.) As Wei Ying got closer, closer, Lan Zhan would murmur, \u201cGood boy,\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, who\u2019s crashed his virtual car approximately twenty times in the last thirty seconds, gets up from the couch mid-round and excuses himself to use the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second the door closes behind him, he\u2019s struggling with the zipper of his jeans, the denim too tight, painful and chafing against his dick. His underwear is sticky with precome, which is something he can be embarrassed about in another few minutes. With a trembling hand, he jerks himself off, imagines Lan Zhan\u2019s cool grip instead while he tells him, low and approving, <em> good boy \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying comes in about four pumps, biting hard on his lip to stifle the noise of it. He manages to catch most of the mess in his other hand, and he spends the next few minutes shaking against the bathroom door, entirely blank. He takes in his flushed, slouched reflection in Lan Zhan\u2019s wide mirror and momentarily doesn\u2019t recognize the person that stares back at him, glassy-eyed and a little lost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying moves to wash his hands, grabbing toilet paper to clean the rest of himself off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, that had just been a one-off. Because of the liquor, for one. His sexual inexperience is such that he\u2019s never actually seen himself in such lewd situations \u2014 of course he\u2019s bound to get hot and bothered over it. It doesn\u2019t mean \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean that \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dries his hands and rejoins Lan Zhan on the couch, and sticks to the other side of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, yeah, there\u2019s the occasional situation like that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But <em> other </em> than that, other than the occasional wet dream where Wei Ying wakes up in a state of half-fogged, searing arousal with only the leftover impression of Lan Zhan\u2019s low, wordless voice, they\u2019re fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, and except for:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ever going to tell me,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps to him over breakfast the following Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pauses half-chew to stare blankly, then he swallows. \u201cTell you what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m like, accepting of all types or whatever,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, red as a beet and glaring at his congee like it\u2019s personally crossed him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you feel like you can\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTypes?\u201d Wei Ying echoes, a little warily. \u201cTalk to you about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re dating Lan Zhan,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, then stabs a bite of his breakfast into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating,\u201d Wei Ying says to the room at large. \u201cI\u2019m straight. I don\u2019t know why I have to keep telling everyone this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I always thought, too,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, some of the flush receding from his face. \u201cBut you\u2019re over there like every night, you bring him food, all you do is talk about him and text him. I just wanted to, like \u2014\u201d He makes a face like he\u2019s passing an uncomfortable bout of gas. \u201cI know I said some stuff about him a few weeks ago, before I knew you actually liked him, and I just wanted to say, like. I accept. Or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate your accepting my <em> friendship </em>with Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cYou do know that\u2019s what friends do, right? Go over to each other\u2019s houses and sometimes eat together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t give me that,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. He gets so rankled at being patronized. Youngest siblings. \u201cIt more has to do with the fact that you\u2019re <em> fucking obsessed with him.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Wei Ying protests, just as his phone dings. He dives for it without thinking, and bites down on a tiny grin when he sees it\u2019s a string of rabbit emojis from Lan Zhan. Wei Ying has recently been instructing him on emoticon usage, and Lan Zhan has been an apt, if somewhat predictable, student.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI rest my case,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, bitchily, then moves his dish to the sink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s all fine. Other than the occasional wet dream, and the occasional stray fantasy of Lan Zhan\u2019s, and other than the fact that everyone he knows thinks they\u2019re together, it\u2019s all fine. Maybe it should be weirder than it is, that Lan Zhan is attracted to Wei Ying and Wei Ying is aware of it, and that\u2019s somehow increased their hangout time <em> more </em>rather than less, but he doesn\u2019t really \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really factor in. He just likes hanging out with Lan Zhan. There\u2019s a lot about him that he\u2019d never known before, more and more layers he keeps unpeeling under the stony surface of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all fine, and then they get invited to one of Huaisang\u2019s house parties.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Wei Ying drags Lan Zhan along with him. Huaisang hosts one of these shindigs like once a month, and Wei Ying has long grown bored of the usual company there, but it might be a fun experience with Lan Zhan by his side. Lan Zhan, who doesn\u2019t drink, who acts as a natural human-repellant wherever he goes. It\u2019s perfect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The music is already throbbing through the walls of Huaisang\u2019s two-story apartment by the time they show up, an audible vibration through the walls. Wei Ying already has a few drinks coursing through his system, because going to Huaisang\u2019s parties sober is intolerable. Bravened by the alcohol, he\u2019d opted for a slightly sluttier look tonight, which mostly means a nicer sweatshirt and tighter skinny jeans. He hasn\u2019t dabbled in the world of makeup yet, but he had seriously considered it for the evening before he\u2019d chickened out. Just to...maybe Lan Zhan would like it, or think it was interesting. Huaisang wears makeup and it\u2019s all cool \u2014 plenty of guys do, to hide blemishes or just to look nicer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, not that it matters what Lan Zhan thinks. It\u2019s just \u2014 gay men are into that, right? Into other boys wearing makeup?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trail of thought derails when the door swings open and Huaisang ushers them in, wreathed in weed smoke and reeking of liquor. He\u2019s wearing this lacy shawl-type situation and a completely sheer black top, his nipple piercings nearly poking through the material. Is that the kind of thing Lan Zhan would be into? Wei Ying wonders as Huaisang drags them around the apartment, making introductions and flashing Lan Zhan around like a shiny new gadget.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan, because he\u2019s an incessantly good person, tolerates all of it in good form, but Wei Ying can sense his private discomfort even without thought-checking him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have dragged him here tonight, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says in a low voice the moment Huaisang is distracted. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay if you\u2019re miserable here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to come,\u201d Lan Zhan says, like that settles the matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but I want to do a lot of things. Most of them aren\u2019t good ideas, and most of them I get bored of halfway through anyway. Just \u2014 I don\u2019t know, tap me three times if you want to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lan Zhan says, in this serene tone of voice that indicates he will do no such thing because he\u2019s a martyr to the cause of suffering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sighs at him good-naturedly, then he crowds closer to Lan Zhan, their sides brushing together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee anyone you like?\u201d Wei Ying asks. He scans each attendant critically. None of these people look like good enough suitors for Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You, </em>Lan Zhan says, and Wei Ying snorts and shoots back, \u201cOkay, that doesn\u2019t count. You\u2019re forced to be here with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is silent in response, and when Wei Ying turns to look at him, Lan Zhan is watching him with a slightly baffled expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck. Had Lan Zhan not said that out loud?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKidding,\u201d he scrambles to say with an awkward, shrill laugh. \u201cAh, I\u2019m just kidding, Lan Zhan. I\u2019ll be on the lookout for you, okay? I make a pretty good wingman when I put my mind to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except there is. There is a need. Surely there\u2019s someone here, or \u2014 or out there in the world \u2014 that can give Lan Zhan what he deserves while Wei Ying \u2014 can\u2019t. The thought makes Wei Ying\u2019s throat tighten, an uncomfortable clench in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, more seriously than before. \u201cUm, would you mind getting me a drink? There should be some stuff set out in the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods and immediately complies, and Wei Ying watches him go, feeling that weird ache through every part of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-xiongggg,\u201d Huaisang\u2019s voice breaks in, and a hand winds tightly around his wrist. Wei Ying turns, only to find that Huaisang also has Mianmian by the arm. She looks tipsy and a little wine-flushed but mostly annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying says, taken off guard. \u201cHi, Mianmian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Mianmian says curtly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without another word, Huaisang begins to drag both of them toward the hallway, listing a little in his steps as he does. He\u2019d looked a little gone behind the eyes, misty like it gets when he\u2019s twisted, and in Wei Ying\u2019s experience, the look usually means a horrible decision is close behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured I could give you two some alone time,\u201d Huaisang throws over his shoulder, almost lost under the pounding of the music. \u201cMy roommate\u2019s out, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really good, thanks,\u201d Wei Ying says loudly. Anxiety is a brick in his stomach, solid and sudden.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, Huaisang,\u201d Mianmian says, but she lets herself be tugged along behind him anyway, her face bright red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome onnnn, you two,\u201d Huaisang wheedles as he pulls both Wei Ying and Mianmian through the main area. A few of their other coworkers start clapping and hooting when they realize what\u2019s going on, a smattering of drunken encouragement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying twists in Huaisang\u2019s grip, and as he does, he locks eyes with Lan Zhan across the room. Lan Zhan is staring at them, a little pale and stricken-looking, frozen in the doorway to the kitchen. He\u2019s holding Wei Ying\u2019s drink in one hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has no time to open his mouth and say something \u2014 to even make some sort of face to indicate what\u2019s going on \u2014 before Huaisang pushes the two of them into the nearest room of the hallway and locks it behind him. Who <em> has </em>exterior locks, anyway? Serial killers?!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNie-xiong,\u201d Wei Ying complains as he pounds on the door, and he hears Huaisang cackling through the wood. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun, you two!\u201d Huaisang calls, then raps three times on the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Wei Ying tells Mianmian at once. \u201cHe knows nothing\u2019s going to happen, he\u2019s just messing around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mianmian snaps. Her obvious embarrassment is prickly, sharpening her tone. She folds her arms over her chest. \u201cThis is so stupid and juvenile. We\u2019re adults.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rotates to look at her, then leans back slightly against the door. He rubs his arm awkwardly. \u201cWell. I guess we\u2019re stuck here, for at least a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian drops her gaze to her feet, her crossed arms tightening. \u201cYou know people are expecting us to do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying thinks of Lan Zhan\u2019s expression, the moment he\u2019d watched Wei Ying and Mianmian thrown into a bedroom together. That strange ache that\u2019s still knotted tight inside him. What Lan Zhan must think of Wei Ying, what he must be imagining is happening. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian gusts out an irritated sigh. \u201cWell, we might as well get it over with. It doesn\u2019t have to be weird or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blanks. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian\u2019s hand raises between them, and it floats awkwardly in midair before she rests it on Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder. She looks as nervous as he feels, her eyes darting uncertainly over Wei Ying\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her thoughts roll into him, a distinct ringing in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be so bad to kiss Wei Ying, would it? He\u2019s kind and a friend and has a sweet face. I might even like him, if I actually </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows, opening his mouth to say something to abate the situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> liked men like that, </em> Mianmian\u2019s thoughts continue. <em> I guess if I close my eyes, it\u2019ll be the same as kissing a\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s speaking before his brain signs off on it \u2014 something to salvage this, to keep Mianmian from feeling like she has to do anything, when she\u2019s \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gay,\u201d he blurts out, and then he freezes, his body going cold all over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian stills too, her eyes widening and her mouth parting in surprise. Her hand slips off his shoulder, her inner monologue dropping off into silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had not. Meant to say that. Some wires had gotten crossed, somehow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Wei Ying,\u201d Mianmian is saying, then she blinks as she visibly softens. \u201cI had no idea. Thank you for telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She reaches up to squeeze his shoulder again, her face creased with sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2014 never have guessed. It\u2019s a relief that Huaisang and I aren't the only ones in the office. </em> There\u2019s a click then, her tone shifting to some kind of comprehension. <em> That must be why he and Lan Zhan </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Wei Ying interrupts her, and then drops off into silence again. He can\u2019t just \u2014 fake-come out, and then immediately take it back, he\u2019ll look ridiculous. He can\u2019t say that he\u2019s not involved with Lan Zhan, when he\u2019d accidentally snatched that piece of information from Mianmian\u2019s private thoughts. He has no idea what he\u2019s supposed to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian seems to detect the dawning panic in his tone, or in whatever must be evident on his face, because she quickly says, \u201cWei Ying. I won\u2019t tell anyone. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. It\u2019s really not a big deal at all, believe me \u2014 your business is your business. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I,\u201d Wei Ying says in a small voice. <em> I\u2019m not gay, </em>is what he wants to say. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian smiles warmly at him, then turns and bangs on the door with a savage furor. \u201cNIE HUAISANG!!! If you don\u2019t let us out right now, I\u2019m going to tell your brother why you were really out of office on Friday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The doorknob wiggles, then the door finally cracks open, Huaisang\u2019s whining filtering through. \u201cMianmian, you can\u2019t use da-ge against me, what the fuck, that\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mianmian raises her eyebrows, and says, very crisply, \u201cFuck you,\u201d and storms off toward the front door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Huaisang says, staring after her with a distressed expression. \u201cIt was just a joke. Sorry if it went too far?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying demands. He\u2019s desperately scanned the main area by now, but Lan Zhan is nowhere to be found, Wei Ying\u2019s untouched drink abandoned on the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had he left? Wei Ying feels a lurch in his chest. Surely Lan Zhan wouldn\u2019t do that, he wouldn\u2019t leave Wei Ying here without at least telling him he was going \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKitchen, I think,\u201d Huaisang says, scratching the back of his head. \u201cDid anything happen with Mianmian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you we\u2019ve known each other forever,\u201d Wei Ying says, unable to conceal the annoyance in his voice. \u201cIt was just weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the constructive criticism under advisement,\u201d Huaisang says, then hiccups. Wei Ying rolls his eyes and moves quickly toward the kitchen, grabbing the drink Lan Zhan had left for him on the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds Lan Zhan standing by the counter, pressed stiffly against its ledge and wearing a guarded, irritated expression. There\u2019s another man talking to him that Wei Ying doesn\u2019t recognize, closer to Lan Zhan than what\u2019s usually allowed. Wei Ying can\u2019t hear what the stranger is saying over the music, but the tone of it sounds unctuous, almost nasal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the sight, Wei Ying feels an unpleasant sensation curdle through him, sour in his throat. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome douchebag named Su She,\u201d Huaisang replies, probably not quiet enough. \u201cHe shows up at these things like a cockroach or something. Meng Yao always invites him along without asking anybody first and it\u2019s like, for fuck\u2019s sake, <em> why.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying watches the two of them closely. Lan Zhan is backed up as far against the counter as he can manage, a plastic cup of water gripped tight in his hand. He hasn\u2019t noticed Wei Ying yet; he\u2019s staring at a fixed point beyond Su She\u2019s head like he\u2019s trying to astral-project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why isn\u2019t Lan Zhan moving away and telling this guy to fuck off, the way he does with everyone else who invades his personal space?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a little something,\u201d Huaisang says, dabbing at Wei Ying\u2019s cheek with a concentrated expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying finally tears his eyes away from Lan Zhan. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just the vinegar leaking out of your pores,\u201d Huaisang says, then smirks. \u201cReally, Wei-xiong, control your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Wei Ying mutters. He wrenches his gaze away again from where Su She is still trying to unsubtly wriggle past Lan Zhan\u2019s wall of personal space. \u201cI\u2019m not jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang gives an airy little laugh. \u201cIf I\u2019d known better, I would have thrown you in that room with Lan Zhan instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens his mouth, a witty retort already shaped in his mouth, but then he thinks about what that would have really entailed \u2014 what might have happened, if Lan Zhan and he had\u2026.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels a slow flush warming his cheeks, and his mouth shuts again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any trace of teasing clears from Huaisang\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Huaisang says. \u201cOh, you really...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re going to say, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huaisang\u2019s face starts to soften into understanding, into sympathy, and Wei Ying quickly glances away, back toward Lan Zhan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watching him with another person, Wei Ying feels some bitter clench knotting tighter and tighter in his stomach. Even if it\u2019s not Su She, it\u2019s only a matter of time before another boy comes along and snags Lan Zhan\u2019s attention, steals his affection and all of that steadfast devotion. Someone that can give Lan Zhan all of that in return, someone who\u2019s actually comfortable with who they are. Wei Ying is suddenly, irrationally envious of this hypothetical gay person to the point of rage; they would be so at ease with themself, enough so to flounce into a relationship with Lan Zhan in a way that Wei Ying \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, no \u2014 it\u2019s just that it would mean seeing Lan Zhan less. Right? It would alter their friendship in some weird and unspeakable way, if Lan Zhan dated someone else. Fell in love with someone else. Of course Wei Ying would be jealous of anyone else sponging up Lan Zhan\u2019s attention, friend or not, when he\u2019s been in the warm epicenter of it for the last few weeks. Which \u2014 when had that happened? When had Lan Zhan become so inextricably woven into his life that the thought of a life without him hurts in the strangest, most buried places?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is arrested by the sudden, unwelcome image of Lan Zhan kissing this faceless man. Marrying him, with that soft smile that curls at the corners of his mouth, that hidden smile that has to be coaxed out, that isn\u2019t for anyone else. He can feel his chest aching like it\u2019s split around something hollow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-xiong,\u201d Huaisang\u2019s voice floats into his awareness, and there\u2019s a hand on his shoulder. His friend\u2019s thoughts are tangled and buzzed, but his concern is unmistakable. \u201cYou look like you got kicked in the spleen. Or like you\u2019re about to cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need air,\u201d Wei Ying says, swatting his hand away, and hares toward the balcony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s outside, he wraps his arms tighter around himself, shaking a little with the cold as it washes over him. He still has that gross, acid-wash feeling in his chest, building and building. It\u2019s ridiculous to be so upset just at the <em> hypothetical </em>of something; Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t even indicated any interest in that person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But what if he had?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hears the door quietly slide open behind him, and he peeks over his shoulder. It\u2019s Lan Zhan, who watches him steadily as he shuts the door again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Ying says weakly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without another word, Lan Zhan slips out of his coat and drapes it over Wei Ying\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Wei Ying says. He feels, heinously, like he might burst into tears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hands hover over his shoulders where he\u2019d dropped the jacket. Not touching, not quite. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being so nice to me all the time,\u201d Wei Ying says in a thick voice. His eyes are stinging. Maybe he\u2019s a little drunker than he thought. \u201cI don\u2019t even deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t say a word, just silently rounds the bench to sit next to Wei Ying with his hands clasped on his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset,\u201d Lan Zhan observes, his voice gentle. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blows out a wet breath and looks off down the street. His eyes are tearing with the cold, the streetlights streaking and dripping sideways. \u201cNothing even happened. I\u2019m just drunk and stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are only one of those things,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStupid,\u201d Wei Ying agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan huffs a small sound, then rubs his hands together once. \u201cNot that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d Wei Ying blurts out. He still resolutely refuses to look at Lan Zhan. He stares down at a smudge on his high-tops instead. \u201cWith Mianmian. I \u2014 nothing happened at all. I don\u2019t know, I just wanted you to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peripherally, Wei Ying sees Lan Zhan shift in place. Then he asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really \u2014 um, into it? I guess? I mean, she\u2019s a long-time friend, and it would just be weird for both of us \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, not rudely. \u201cI meant, why did you want me to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d A big punch of air escapes Wei Ying\u2019s lungs. He scrambles. \u201cI just \u2014 I didn\u2019t want things to be weird at work. If you thought Mianmian and I hooked up or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods once, slowly. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying huddles tighter into Lan Zhan\u2019s coat, pulling the sleeves so that the warmth cocoons around him more completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lan Zhan says, a moment later, \u201cthat you were put in a situation in which you were uncomfortable. I should have said something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Ying says, his mouth hanging open a little, then he blinks. \u201cOh, I mean, it\u2019s really fine. It wasn\u2019t that uncomfortable, it\u2019s just that Mianmian\u2019s a lesbi \u2014 \u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He claps a hand over his mouth, shocked by his own indiscretion. Wow, he\u2019s really just. A fucking sieve for information. Get a few drinks in his system and he\u2019s hemorrhaging everyone\u2019s personal details.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Lan Zhan again, after a silent moment. \u201cShe told you that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmm,\u201d Wei Ying hedges. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says, and then, because apparently he\u2019s committed to seeing out his own self-destruction, he adds, \u201cI told her I was gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan freezes next to Wei Ying; it wouldn\u2019t be noticeable to anyone else, but Wei Ying feels him stiffen, ever so slightly. Their knees are barely a finger\u2019s width\u2019s apart. He could so easily reach out and know what he \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven though you are not,\u201d Lan Zhan says, blankly. Carefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows, struggling with how to answer, before he says, in a small voice, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s brow furrows ever so slightly. \u201cThen...why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Wei Ying says, wondering if Lan Zhan\u2019s sleeves would make for an effective noose. \u201cI was just \u2014 trying to make her feel more comfortable, I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA strange way,\u201d Lan Zhan says evenly, \u201cto do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy methods are unconventional,\u201d Wei Ying concedes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales, slow and steady and quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blames the liquor for the next line of inquiry, because that\u2019s the only rational explanation for how quickly it stumbles out of him. \u201cIf I were, though, would you \u2014 I mean, hahaha, theoretically, would you think I was \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s stare into him bores through to the very core, so unsparing that Wei Ying almost shrivels up before he finishes. But he commits, and concludes, very timidly, \u201cHot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan keeps staring at him. He looks like he might want to sigh again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, what the hell is Wei Ying doing. What is he even <em> trying </em> to do? He already knows Lan Zhan has some sort of attraction to him. Maybe he needs to hear it; maybe hearing it in a spoken voice will solidify that it\u2019s real, that if things were different on his end, they really could\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks like he may also be questioning whatever the fuck Wei Ying is doing, but he indulges him, because he\u2019s Lan Zhan and probably just \u2014 the best person on earth, potentially.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan says slowly. \u201cI would.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so the past few weeks haven\u2019t been a mass hallucination. Lan Zhan really does think he\u2019s hot, straightness notwithstanding. He at least has that over the imaginary man that Lan Zhan is going to marry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, cool,\u201d Wei Ying says, in a decidedly uncool voice. \u201cBecause I just wanted to say that...if I <em> were </em>gay, you would be the first person I would...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is looking at him now like he\u2019s been sucker-punched in the stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, god, he\u2019s making it <em> worse, </em> somehow; he\u2019d been hoping to make Lan Zhan feel better about the unrequited-crush situation with a <em> it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me </em>spiel, because it\u2019s really true \u2014 if Wei Ying were physically attracted to men, if things were different, he would jump Lan Zhan so fast their heads would both spin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Wei Ying flounders, then scrubs a hand over the back of his neck, which is growing warmer and warmer. \u201cI just think you\u2019re really great. And whoever gets to have you would be really \u2014 really lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s at that moment that Lan Zhan reaches over, so quickly that Wei Ying can\u2019t even blink, and without another word, he downs the rest of Wei Ying\u2019s drink in one shot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares at him with his mouth fully open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns to look at him, his gaze already a little unfocused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Lan Zhan says, with a small hiccup, then he gets to his feet without another word and unsteadily moves back into the house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares after him for another few speechless seconds before he mouths <em> what the fuck </em>to himself, and follows after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So: apparently, a single slug of whatever horrible concoction Wei Ying was sipping on had been enough to get Lan Zhan absolutely plastered. Which means that a DiDi is a necessity. Huaisang evidently feels guilty enough about the Mianmian situation earlier that he calls it for them and also pays. He watches with his thin, lace-crusted arms looped anxiously over his chest as Wei Ying and Lan Zhan bundle into the backseat, then gives a little wave as they drive off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is fully passed out against the window, his head bobbing with the motions of the car and his mouth slightly parted. Wei Ying watches him in disbelief, even pokes him a few times, but his thoughts are complete static. He\u2019s truly lights out. It\u2019s kind of cute. Poor Lan Zhan can\u2019t hang. The dear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rests his cheek against the cold window-glass and feels himself smile, a creeping fondness collecting in his chest like lichen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they get closer to their destination, he reaches out to touch Lan Zhan\u2019s face \u2014 just to shake him awake, but he feels his heart do something funny, a skip then a hard <em> ba-dump. </em>Lan Zhan\u2019s skin is cool to the touch, unbelievably soft \u2014 he probably has some insane, vegan skincare routine. It\u2019s the first time that Wei Ying has been able to touch him without reservation. Without the guilt of knowing what he shouldn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just Lan Zhan, asleep and his face tilted into Wei Ying\u2019s hand. Wei Ying\u2019s pulse accelerates as he continues to stare. Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth is a little pouted, his lower lip jutting out where his cheek is pressed against Wei Ying\u2019s hand. He looks so sweet like this, young and vulnerable and so much warmer than his usual exterior. He\u2019s really...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour stop,\u201d the driver tells him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes some considerable work to wake Lan Zhan, and even more to actually get him vertical and moving. He\u2019s nearly deadweight against Wei Ying\u2019s side, but he stirs a little more alertly when he seems to recognize their surroundings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I brought you all the way home,\u201d Wei Ying teases him, then groans a little as Lan Zhan stumbles and sends them both zagging sideways along the sidewalk. \u201cLan Zhan, it\u2019s no wonder you don\u2019t drink. Look at the state of you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d says Lan Zhan, managing even now to sound disdainful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan can probably walk fine enough on his own, but he keeps a bear-trap grip around Wei Ying as they stumble through the building. Lan Zhan is evidently at a point drunk enough where his thoughts are unintelligible, which is sort of a relief for Wei Ying, in its own way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They thump their way through Lan Zhan\u2019s front door, and with his arm still around Wei Ying, Lan Zhan steers both of them toward the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure you can let go of me for this part of being drunk,\u201d Wei Ying says, then pauses in concern. \u201cUnless you\u2019re feeling sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. The motion-sensored lights of the bathroom automatically flicker on as they stumble in. Lan Zhan finally releases Wei Ying to peel off his jacket, his gaze fixed sightlessly on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is a little at a loss for what to do, but he thinks his role for the evening might be over. \u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not go,\u201d Lan Zhan says, at once so forceful that he sounds angry. He snaps his head up to glare at Wei Ying; in any other context it would be unnerving, but Wei Ying has to work to suppress the roll of laughter that works through him. He looks so grumpy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Wei Ying says appeasingly, playing along. \u201cI won\u2019t leave, okay? Lan Zhan, you\u2019re such an unreasonable drunk. Just what is it you intend to do with me, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize how suggestive the words are until they\u2019re spoken, and his jaw snaps shut with an audible click. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes flash like the strike of a match, and then he\u2019s advancing toward Wei Ying, who stumbles a step back, his pelvis colliding with the sink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying stammers, when Lan Zhan closes in on his personal space, near enough that his body warmth pulses between them, his scent everywhere. \u201cI \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Lan Zhan holds up his arm for Wei Ying\u2019s inspection. Wei Ying blinks, and also looks at the arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d Wei Ying says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan observes a smudge on his skin with a rapt intensity. \u201cDirty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying feels himself relax at the new focus of Lan Zhan\u2019s attention; he gives a small huff of amusement. \u201cIt\u2019s just some mud. If you really want to, you can wipe it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan speaks slowly and with heavy gravity. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Wei Ying echoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stumbles over to the shower and flicks it on. Then he steps inside, fully clothed, and stares at Wei Ying with the world\u2019s most solemn expression as he gets absolutely soaked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying can\u2019t help it; he breaks into a fit of laughter so unrelenting that he almost cries, bending over at the waist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he resurfaces, wiping at his eye with a knuckle and laughter still petering out of him, Lan Zhan is still observing him from under the shower spray. He looks more upset than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Wei Ying says, his voice thrumming with laughter even as he crosses quickly over to him with soothing hand gestures. \u201cGege, I\u2019m not laughing at you. I mean, I am a little. But it\u2019s only because you\u2019re so...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan continues to appraise him indifferently as rivulets of shower water pour down his face, a slight, dissatisfied pinch between his brows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 cute,\u201d Wei Ying finishes, then breaks down into giggles again. He can\u2019t seem to stop himself, laughter bubbling out of him in every direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, he <em> really </em> needed to laugh like this. It\u2019s been so long since he laughed hard enough that his ribs ached around it. To think that it had been Lan Zhan who\u2019d wrung it out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I need to get you drunk more often,\u201d Wei Ying continues. \u201cWho knew you would be so fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face does something indecipherable, but it looks like he\u2019s come to some sort of decision. His arm snaps out, with far more speed and grace than such a state of inebriation should warrant, and he grabs Wei Ying\u2019s arm, hauling him into the shower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hey!</em>\u201d Wei Ying yelps, then flinches as the warm spray soaks into his clothes, spilling uncomfortably down the neck of his hoodie. \u201cLan Zhan! You can\u2019t just bully people into showers with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDirty,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, and Wei Ying watches warily as he lathers his hands with shampoo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d Wei Ying warns him, then sighs when Lan Zhan reaches out to work two gentle hands through his dampening hair. His thoughts are completely illegible, the black-water smooth of the truly wasted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying complains, although the shampoo smells nice, herbal and a little sweet. It smells like Lan Zhan. The suds of it are soaking into Wei Ying\u2019s clothes, but he\u2019s a little afraid of what Lan Zhan will do if he tries to break away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEyes,\u201d Lan Zhan instructs with a frown. Wei Ying closes them, careful to keep them squeezed shut as the shampoo slides over his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a madman,\u201d Wei Ying informs him. \u201cLan Zhan, I have never, in my entire life, been treated like this. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Lan Zhan says, but he seems very content and at peace with the situation, as though there\u2019s nothing he\u2019d rather do when blackout drunk than this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of your reaction tomorrow, when you wake up and remember all this,\u201d Wei Ying says. He keeps his eyes closed as Lan Zhan\u2019s skilled fingers continue to massage soap into his scalp. \u201cYou\u2019ll be so embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cShh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t shush me!\u201d Wei Ying says with real indignation. \u201cLan Zhan, you can\u2019t yank me into a shower and then tell me to \u2014 <em> mmf.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has sealed one sudsy hand over Wei Ying\u2019s mouth, the other continuing to mindlessly work through Wei Ying\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unbelievable. Wei Ying licks Lan Zhan\u2019s hand and gets a mouthful of shampoo for his trouble. Lan Zhan yanks his hand away as Wei Ying turns to the side and spits, screwing up his face at the soapy taste.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good on the shower now, really, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cThese clothes are starting to get soggy and uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a blank-faced concentration, Lan Zhan reaches out and starts to work at the hem of his sweatshirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAiyo, aiyo!\u201d Wei Ying yelps, slithering away from him. \u201cI\u2019m really good, thanks!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns at him, as though Wei Ying has done something confusing or displeasing. Then he starts to shampoo his own hair, tilting his face up into the shower spray. Absolutely no one on earth should look this sexy while fully clothed in a shower and blitzed out of their mind. It\u2019s absolutely ludicrous, Wei Ying thinks as he watches Lan Zhan shower, as if this is a thing that\u2019s totally normal that they do now. At least there are clothes involved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying waits until he\u2019s finished, then rinses the rest of the suds off of him, tilting his face up into the water as he does. He\u2019s never taken a shower in which he wasn\u2019t naked, so the sensation is incredibly odd, and his clothes weigh heavy and uncomfortable the more water they absorb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s done, Wei Ying checks Lan Zhan over for any stray suds before he yanks him out of the shower. All of Lan Zhan\u2019s downy white towels are neatly folded on the sink; Wei Ying retrieves one of them, then stands up on tiptoe to roughly scrub Lan Zhan\u2019s hair dry. He\u2019s hoping for that same petulant, disgruntled reaction as before, to get another laugh out of it, but Lan Zhan watches him with this strange, soft light even through the roughest of his ministrations, oddly pliant under Wei Ying\u2019s care. That, more than anything, makes Wei Ying\u2019s heart patter nervously in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll done,\u201d Wei Ying announces, dropping the towel over Lan Zhan\u2019s head. \u201cLan Zhan, you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, and grabs Wei Ying\u2019s wrist so tightly the bones creak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhannn,\u201d Wei Ying whines as he\u2019s dragged, but he adheres to Lan Zhan\u2019s whims, trailing after him into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lights flick on when they step through the door, and Wei Ying blinks around to take in his surroundings. This is the one part of the apartment he hasn\u2019t seen yet. Lan Zhan\u2019s bed is massive and neatly made, the comforter a dazzling white with some light blue accents. Lan Zhan\u2019s personal scent is stronger here, sandalwood and whatever other herbal products he uses. There\u2019s a small desk in the corner, another neatly-aligned bookshelf, and a closet, but the bed takes up most of the real estate of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, turning on his heel, \u201cyour bed could fit like four people \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s already out of his shirt, his face entirely devoid of expression. Without so much as looking Wei Ying\u2019s direction, he hooks his thumbs in his waistband and drops his pants, not before Wei Ying spins back around on his heel and stares unseeingly at the far wall, blushing so hard that his eyes smart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWarn a girl first,\u201d Wei Ying says weakly, still staring at the wall \u2014 he hadn\u2019t seen anything he shouldn\u2019t, but it had come very close, there\u2019d been a flash of pale skin and the sharp jut of Lan Zhan\u2019s hipbones, his distinct treasure trail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still dripping all over Lan Zhan\u2019s floors. His sweatshirt feels heavy, chafing and dragging against his skin, and as if reading his thoughts (ha ha), Lan Zhan drops a t-shirt and sweatpants on the bed in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Thanks. Great,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cI\u2019ll just.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both men here, anyway. Wei Ying\u2019s the only one making things awkward; Lan Zhan\u2019s too obliterated to form full sentences, let alone pay attention to Wei Ying\u2019s physical lack of gym routine for the last three years. He quickly peeks over his shoulder to make sure Lan Zhan\u2019s back \u2014 very muscular, sculpted back \u2014 is turned before he wriggles out of his wet clothes, leaving every stitch of it heaped on the floor. He stumbles into the sweatpants as fast as he can manage; they\u2019re a little big on him, being Lan Zhan\u2019s, and he has to tighten the drawstring to make sure they don\u2019t slip. He turns just as Lan Zhan does, and for a frozen moment, they stare at each other across the room, both shirtless and silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the clothes!\u201d Wei Ying says to dispel the awkwardness, and he throws on the shirt as quickly as he can. \u201cNice and dry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods once and goes back to whatever he\u2019s doing in his closet. He\u2019s still not wearing a shirt, and his sweatpants are on backwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is a coward. That\u2019s the only explanation for why he would use the cover of drunkenness to coax answers out of Lan Zhan, but he can\u2019t help himself, he has to know \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you talking to Su She at the party earlier,\u201d Wei Ying says casually. \u201cHe definitely is like, completely in love with you, hahaha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, as though the reminder of the conversation displeases him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying begins, \u201cYou know, if you liked him back, you could \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHate him,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, completely dismissive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The harsh answer shocks a laugh out of Wei Ying, as well as the sudden, giddy relief of it. \u201cLan Zhan! Hate is such a strong word!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHate him,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, and he stares at Wei Ying with such a fixed intensity that Wei Ying\u2019s nerves start to jitter, a warm and heavy churn in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could always try, um, Huaisang,\u201d Wei Ying hedges. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head like an irritated horse batting away a fly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOr there\u2019s, uh \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, with such quick force that he sounds sober. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Ying repeats, inanely. His knees feel spongy, starting to weaken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan crosses to him slowly, just as he had before, his gaze honed on him. Wei Ying\u2019s feet are rooted into the ground; his teeth are clenched so tight his jaw is aching. A tinny, wordless panic floods him as Lan Zhan\u2019s approach nears, the cut lines of his body sharpening with his proximity. Wei Ying involuntarily takes a step backward, retreating again, and his back hits the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had done this to himself \u2014 he\u2019s always doing that, unwittingly backing himself into corners. Lan Zhan\u2019s not in control of his actions right now; he could do anything he wanted to Wei Ying, and Wei Ying wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His cock throbs hard in his borrowed sweatpants, momentarily so distracting that he sucks in a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d let him, Wei Ying thinks dizzily as Lan Zhan stops in front of him, hazy gold eyes alight on Wei Ying\u2019s face, if it was what Lan Zhan wanted, needed, he\u2019d let him take \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says again, his voice a low rasp, his gaze hypnotic like he\u2019s \u2014 a fucking snake charmer or something, and Wei Ying\u2019s a tiny sand boa, helpless to resist, utterly ensnared.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, his pulse high in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan reaches out then, as quickly as he had in the shower, and shoves Wei Ying toward the bed. It\u2019s so unexpected that Wei Ying stumbles, falling halfway onto the mattress, nearly bent over. It splays him out inappropriately, his limbs sort of akimbo as he tries to re-balance himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?!\u201d he says over his shoulder, a little hysterically. Lan Zhan can\u2019t really be planning on \u2014 he can\u2019t really mean to \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lights flick off \u2014 some remote-operated situation \u2014 and then Lan Zhan is clambering into bed behind him. He twines an arm tight around Wei Ying\u2019s middle and pulls him in close against his front.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRest,\u201d he mumbles, then exhales through his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying remains stiff for another few moments, then the tension uncoils from his muscles when he realizes that this is really all Lan Zhan intends to do. It\u2019s just cuddling. Cuddling he can handle. Cuddling is actually kind of nice. Lan Zhan is warm, and bigger than him, and his grip is tight in a way that\u2019s grounding, not restrictive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By his silence, Wei Ying had assumed Lan Zhan had passed out again, so he startles when Lan Zhan mumbles a moment later, the sound abrupt in the dark, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows, and twists a little in Lan Zhan\u2019s hold to show he\u2019s listening. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels Lan Zhan rest his forehead between his shoulder-blades, the hot-cold push-pull of his breath through his thin, borrowed shirt. It sends goosebumps prickling across his skin. Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts are still fuzzy radio static, but there\u2019s a mantra that\u2019s slowly sharpening in clarity, that pierces through to Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Tell him tell him tell him tell him tell him </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s hands tighten in their grip on the sheets; he\u2019s suddenly terrified at the prospect of what Lan Zhan might say to him, when he\u2019s not in control of when and how he says it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan \u2014\u201d he begins, in a futile attempt to derail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says again, his voice a little muffled. He inhales deep through his nose, then exhales just as evenly. His next words are quiet but distinct, unmistakeable. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing Wei Ying didn\u2019t already know, and yet \u2014 it still feels like some white-hot fork of electricity through him, to hear Lan Zhan <em> say it.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few beats of silence pass between them \u2014 far too long of a pause for a situation in which something like that is admitted, and Wei Ying is still too tense to pretend to have fallen asleep. Lan Zhan is also unmoving and quiet, still holding him tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Wei Ying swallows, his throat dry, and he begins to speak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m really...I don\u2019t know what to do. I really like you. I want to spend all my time with you. I don\u2019t want you to be with anyone else, even if that\u2019s selfish of me. I think I might...really, actually like you like that, not just as a friend. But I don\u2019t...I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d He takes a deep breath, trying not to hyperventilate. The liquor has well worn off now, and he feels like he\u2019s spinning out, unsure of what he\u2019s even saying or what he means. \u201cCan we maybe take things slow? Like, um, be with each other without the physical stuff? I just don\u2019t know if I \u2014 what I like, but I just know that I actually, um, do like you, and I...I like that you like me, I don\u2019t want you to like anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has gone very still and heavy against him, the pattern of his breathing slow against Wei Ying\u2019s back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease say something,\u201d Wei Ying says, a little unhinged from scooping out the insides of his chest for the last full trainwreck of a minute. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He peeks over his shoulder, terrified at what reaction he\u2019ll find.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is dead asleep, his face entirely slack and his arm still slung around Wei Ying\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At once, a cool wash of relief floods through Wei Ying, so visceral that it\u2019s euphoric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so. That had been a freebie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And also the world\u2019s shittiest practice run. He hadn\u2019t even really \u2014 known what he wanted or felt, until he was saying it out loud, letting his mouth fit words to thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying presses his burning face into the pillow and chews viciously on his lip. One thing from the evening has become glaringly clear, impossible to get around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t been talking out of his ass just now. His words may have stumbled, hesitated and circumvented, but he had meant them honestly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He likes Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying tests the thought, lets it float experimentally for a moment just to see how it feels. <em> I like Lan Zhan. </em> He tries again, feeling bolder, pushing it further. <em> I have a crush on Lan Zhan. </em> To think it so directly feels a little weird, but not inaccurate. <em> I want Lan Zhan to \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the wall. He slams into it headfirst. His desire for something physical with Lan Zhan...definitely exists. That much has been made excruciatingly clear by the MarioKart incident, by the numerous wet dreams, by what had just transpired moments ago. Why is it so much harder to articulate than the other stuff? Why can\u2019t he just <em> admit </em> it, let himself imagine it without shying away from it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying must somehow manage to panic himself into a sleep-state, because the next thing he knows, he finds himself blinking awake into bright, whitewashed sunlight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing he notices, beyond the fact that it\u2019s no longer nighttime, is that the bed is empty, the sheets next to him cold and stiff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sits up at once and glances around the room, just to be sure, but the fact of the matter is self-evident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying spends the next ten minutes staring unseeingly at the ceiling. He\u2019s not really sure what he\u2019s expecting, by waiting around \u2014 maybe that Lan Zhan will slip back into the room, unobtrusive, freshly showered or with breakfast in hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The minutes tick by, each one a slow, cold drip over Wei Ying\u2019s head. Every passing moment surrounded by Lan Zhan\u2019s absence feels more unbearable, the silence of the apartment a hefty and looming weight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he appraises Lan Zhan\u2019s dustless ceiling, an awful thought occurs to him. Maybe Lan Zhan actually <em> had </em> heard Wei Ying\u2019s confession last night, and had been pretending to be asleep last night to give him an out. That\u2019s suddenly the only characteristic explanation Wei Ying can think of, for why Lan Zhan would disappear so abruptly and without a word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe the confession had made him angry, or...or upset? Wei Ying racks his brain to remember exactly what he\u2019d said, panic clawing its way up and up in his throat. He\u2019d said he didn\u2019t want to be physical, at least not yet, but pretty much also that he didn\u2019t want Lan Zhan to like other people. What kind of shitty, selfish ask is that? Of course Lan Zhan would be upset. Most of Lan Zhan\u2019s fantasies about him up until now have been very physical, because Lan Zhan actually knows who he is and what he wants from a person. Why the hell would he want to waste his time waiting around on a wreck like Wei Ying? On someone who\u2019s still figuring his shit out, but would still be self-interested enough to request that Lan Zhan put his life on hold until he does?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Wei Ying finds him, he can make things right. He can tell Lan Zhan that he\u2019s sorry, that it had been the liquor talking, that he hadn\u2019t meant any of it after all. Maybe then they can go back to normal \u2014 as normal as things <em> can </em>be in their friendship, with mutual feelings trenched between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the apartment had seemed quiet before, it feels barren with Lan Zhan gone. Wei Ying quickly strips out of Lan Zhan\u2019s clothes and picks up his own where they\u2019re heaped on the floor, cold and crumpled and still damp. He folds the borrowed clothes neatly at the foot of the bed, like a good guest would.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes Lan Zhan works weekends \u2014 maybe he\u2019s at the office logging some case work, just to distract himself? As Wei Ying heads toward the subway, he sends a couple of texts Lan Zhan\u2019s way:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> hey can we talk? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> can you let me know youre ok </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He bites his lip as he hesitates, his eyes tearing up with the cold, before he types out quickly <em> im sorry </em>and shoves his phone into his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The subway ride is quick, and, as it turns out, fruitless. When Wei Ying keys into the office, he finds it completely vacant, the lights shuddering on with his steps as he enters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, he stands there in the empty office, reveling in the strangeness of its stillness with his shoulders drooped. Then he turns and leaves there too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At some point a cold, dreary rain had started up, a thin and spitting mist that toes the edge of snow. Wei Ying hunches his shoulders up by his ears and flips the hood of his sweatshirt up as he walks briskly back to the subway, his hands jammed in his pockets. He could just go home, but the concept of being in his apartment all day is suddenly too anxiety-inducing to consider. He\u2019ll spend all of his time pacing and climbing up walls anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying decides, right then and there, that he\u2019s going to sit by Lan Zhan\u2019s door until he comes back from wherever he\u2019d gone. Lan Zhan <em> has </em> to come home at some point, even if a small and unpleasant voice in Wei Ying chimes in that Lan Zhan may not want to see him. But if Lan Zhan is going to vanish and ignore Wei Ying\u2019s texts, then that leaves camping out as the last resort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone dings while he waits for the subway, and Wei Ying scrambles to fish it out of his pocket, his fingers numb and stiff with damp chill. He squints down at the screen, speckled with mist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has two texts, the first from Jiang Cheng.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>jiang cheng</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> you good? you didn\u2019t come home last night </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other is from Lan Zhan. Wei Ying\u2019s heart slams to a halt like it\u2019s hit the concrete, a spike of adrenaline rocketing through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>lan zhan</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Come over.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has experienced some truly agonizing subway rides in his time, but not one of them can touch this particular trip. Each stop seems to linger, the seconds unspooling into half-hour spans. He has no service either, so he can\u2019t even text Lan Zhan a confirmation that he\u2019s seen the text and he\u2019s on his way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s off the stop, he practically sprints the three blocks to Lan Zhan\u2019s. The rain stings his face, tangling in his eyelashes, and it feels absurdly like a movie scene as he runs, because his life \u2014 this entire scenario and how it had come to be \u2014 is ridiculous. And no less awful for its ridiculousness, but it is what it is. Once he reaches the familiar building, Wei Ying ducks into the warm shelter of the lobby and makes for the elevator. Eight floors up, off the elevator, down the hall, to the right and then the left, and \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets one knock in before the door is swinging open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s appearance is startling, as it always is, immediately arresting in its handsomeness no matter the circumstance or time of day or the length of time since they\u2019ve seen each other. His attire is somewhat incongruous; he\u2019s dressed as though for work, a familiar dress-shirt and crisp black slacks, but his long hair is loosely braided over his shoulder, like he had been in the middle of dressing down (or up?) before Wei Ying\u2019s arrival.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In spite of himself, looking at him, Wei Ying feels his pounding heart trip over a beat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, they both stand there, staring at each other as though petrified into stone, Lan Zhan\u2019s hand still on the door; Wei Ying panting and shivering through his clothes, now dampened twice over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Lan Zhan says abruptly, then turns away from him without another word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not the most promising sign. Wei Ying feels some knot in his stomach twist into a tighter shape, but he follows after Lan Zhan. He stumbles out of his wet shoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Wei Ying scrambles to say, just as Lan Zhan begins, \u201cWei Ying, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both stop again to stare at each other, the door crunching shut behind them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, me first,\u201d Wei Ying rushes out. \u201cLan Zhan, everything I said last night, you can just \u2014 forget it, it was just the alcohol talking, I \u2014 I know you want something physical with someone, and I should never have asked you to even consider \u2014 when I\u2019m figuring everything out and I\u2019ve been all over the place, you know, and \u2014 we can just start over from scratch, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face, in real time, muddles by the second as Wei Ying talks, his eyes a little wide and his brows drawing together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Ying finishes, feeling wretched. He\u2019s sorry for all of it, for leading Lan Zhan on and causing conflict and for taking so long to realize anything, everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop apologizing,\u201d Lan Zhan says, sounding frustrated. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying waits, twisting his wet hoodie string around and around his finger until the circulation cuts off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan speaks slowly, with deliberate care. \u201cI have no memory of last night. Of anything that was said or done. I asked you to come so I could apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of Wei Ying\u2019s breath leaves him in one dizzy rush. He feels himself sag, pressing his shoulders back against the front door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, so \u2014 Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t heard any of it. He really hadn\u2019t...when he\u2019d seen Lan Zhan missing, Wei Ying had assumed that...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI woke up and,\u201d Wei Ying says, in a shrunken voice. He hates how small he sounds. \u201cYou were gone, I thought that you were upset \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI went for a walk. To clear my head.\u201d Lan Zhan\u2019s jaw works, and he speaks the next words with clear difficulty. \u201cWhen I woke this morning...I knew something had...that I had...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pictures the scene Lan Zhan must have woken up to, piecing things together in reverse. Wei Ying in his arms, Wei Ying in his clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan swallows hard. He keeps his gaze lowered, not meeting Wei Ying\u2019s eyes. \u201cTaken advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Wei Ying croaks. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not. Lan Zhan, nothing happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan does meet his eyes then, a little warily, like he thinks Wei Ying might be lying to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Wei Ying insists, shaking a hand in front of him. \u201cNothing happened. I mean, you got into the shower with all of your clothes on, but other than that we just \u2014 went to sleep, pretty much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, like he senses there\u2019s more Wei Ying isn\u2019t saying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing physical happened,\u201d Wei Ying clarifies. \u201cReally, I promise. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just about other things. Wei Ying bites down on his lip against the sudden surge of guilt he feels. All of Lan Zhan\u2019s secrets are still just a hand-brush away, all of his thoughts available for Wei Ying\u2019s perusal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him for another wordless moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI returned this morning,\u201d Lan Zhan says in a low voice. \u201cAnd you were gone. I assumed that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Ying interjects. \u201cLan Zhan, I left to find you, I \u2014 I thought you might be at the office. I thought you were mad at <em> me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The furrow between Lan Zhan\u2019s brow deepens. \u201cWhy would I be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I \u2014\u201d Wei Ying says, and the sentence stops dead. Because any lesser person would be, with what Wei Ying has put him through recently. Any lesser person would be, when Wei Ying knows Lan Zhan\u2019s feelings and would still request exclusivity without physicality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says. It sounds like a plea. \u201cWhatever you said last night, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even important,\u201d Wei Ying says with a stilted laugh. \u201cWe can just forget about \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes a step closer to him, so quick that Wei Ying stumbles back and hits the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me everything I said,\u201d Lan Zhan says in a low voice. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah. Fuck. Shit. Wei Ying had <em> really </em>been hoping to avoid this. But it\u2019s not like he can lie to Lan Zhan, right? Not about this. He deserves to know the details of a conversation he can\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying breathes out slowly, steeling himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say much, really, haha, um. It was just that when you were falling asleep, you said that you, maybe\u2026that you...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes sear into his, a burn that stakes each of Wei Ying\u2019s limbs into place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLiked me,\u201d Wei Ying finishes, each word tailing up into its own question. His voice is almost a whisper, nearly inaudible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face hardly shifts at the words, other than the tightening of his mouth. His eyes close in what looks like resignation, or defeat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I mean, you were blackout drunk, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says quickly, scrambling to fill in defenses that will make this okay, that will make Lan Zhan feel better. \u201cEveryone says things they don\u2019t mean when they\u2019re \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant it,\u201d says Lan Zhan. The three words are as clear as the cut of a knife.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is rapidly losing his foothold. He has no fucking clue how to approach this conversation sober. He\u2019s known, for weeks now, that Lan Zhan likes him this way, so it should be a relief that it\u2019s finally dragged into the open between them, but instead all he can feel is a wriggling, slow-mounting dread. He doesn\u2019t want to lose Lan Zhan, he can\u2019t lose him now \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d is all Wei Ying can think to say. It comes out weak, a little strangled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand the nature of our relationship may change,\u201d Lan Zhan says stiffly. His gaze is focused somewhere beyond Wei Ying, beyond his shoulder. Like he\u2019s shutting down degree by degree. \u201cBut you deserve the truth if we continue to spend time together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At once, Wei Ying feels awful down to his marrow, like he can feel it leaking out of his pores. Here Lan Zhan is, baring his most vulnerable secrets and talking about <em> truth, </em>when Wei Ying is the liar of the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Wei Ying whispers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The response seems to take Lan Zhan off-guard. He blinks at Wei Ying twice, his frown deepening into something perplexed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying rubs at his arm, unable to look Lan Zhan in the eye. He speaks quietly, unevenly. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re really the best. You deserve someone who can\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives an impatient shake of his head. \u201cDon\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying chokes out. His heart races, races, races.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan moves toward him again, closer \u2014 more cautious, like he\u2019s stepping out onto a trembling bridge. For once, Wei Ying doesn\u2019t retreat; he holds his ground, letting Lan Zhan into his space even as his knees threaten to cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying exhales, and the next words pour out of him in a rush, before he even knows what he\u2019s saying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t live up.\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cTo whatever version of me you have in your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pauses at this, visibly digesting the words, before he says, slowly, \u201cYou are you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughs once, clipped and humorless. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the problem, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns again, clearly not understanding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes his head and squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019ll let you down. I\u2019ve already hurt you enough just by hanging around you. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like the words are dragged from him. He doesn\u2019t <em> want </em> to be saying it, doesn\u2019t want to say anything that might make Lan Zhan like him less, that might reveal the truth about him, because he\u2019s <em> selfish</em>. The version of himself that Lan Zhan sees...Wei Ying has greedily allowed himself to profit off of it, has allowed it to self-perpetuate as his own feelings developed. But honesty is the very least of what Lan Zhan deserves \u2014 all of it, thorny and ugly and bared.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says softly. His hand reaches out, and before Wei Ying can flinch away, he\u2019s touching Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A memory settles over Wei Ying like a dropped shroud, a time-faded burst of color. After a couple of disorienting seconds, he realizes he can actually place the scene: an early autumn afternoon within their first few weeks at university. He and Lan Zhan had just barely met. They were certainly nowhere near friends; Lan Zhan had been well on his way to hating him, at that point, and with good reason. By that time, Wei Ying had picked up tormenting Lan Zhan as a fun sport, as a barometer for reactivity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying can remember this day exactly because it had been so beautiful outside and he\u2019d finally had a day free of coursework. He had found Lan Zhan, the shiny new target of his attention span, meditating on a patch of green on campus. Prettier than anything in nature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seeing it through Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes is different. Wei Ying watches his own mischievous smile flickering like the bounce of a flashlight beam as he chatters at an obnoxious cadence. The late afternoon sun spills over both of them in a goldenrod burst. It lights Wei Ying from behind, fracturing over his head. He\u2019s leaning into Lan Zhan\u2019s space in the grass, his delight at being allowed near evident all over his conniving little face. His eyes are bright with warmth as he teases Lan Zhan, smiling with all of his teeth \u2014 has he always looked at Lan Zhan that way, Wei Ying wonders? Has it always been so obvious to everyone but him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes, Wei Ying sees himself warm and effusive and spilling over with joy, lit with sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh, </em>Lan Zhan had thought then, with the sensation like the drop from a cliff, <em>he\u2019s beautiful \u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying snaps back to the present, the back of his head nearly colliding with the door as he gasps. Lan Zhan is watching him closely, so closely that Wei Ying can nearly see himself reflected in the wide dark of his pupils.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> If I could kiss him, </em> Lan Zhan is thinking now, the ache of it a plucked chord. <em> If he would let me </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The stormwall that Wei Ying had carefully constructed, brick by brick \u2014 it crumbles entirely, slides down and crashes into the sea. All that\u2019s left in its wake is a wanting that\u2019s startling in force.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to imagine it, he doesn\u2019t want to live it through Lan Zhan\u2019s imagination, he wants \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Wei Ying hears himself say. \u201cLan Zhan, please, just...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes, flickering over Wei Ying\u2019s features, widen by a sliver. He falters a tiny step, a little shift of weight like he\u2019s been unbalanced.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice, when it comes, is low, uneven. \u201cDo not tease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Wei Ying says. His heart is thundering in his chest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Lan Zhan, please, I \u2014 I\u2019m asking you to \u2014 would you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is suddenly in his space again, closer than before, pressing against every line of him, pushing him back against the door with a loud thud. Wei Ying\u2019s body goes liquid into it, his thoughts emptying out into a pleasant hum. He suddenly feels quiet at being pinned in place, like Lan Zhan won\u2019t let him slip away from himself, like he\u2019s vapor held fast between two immovable objects \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan kisses him. Finally, finally. Wei Ying makes a sound into it, whiny and embarrassing. Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth is warm, lush as fruit, begging to be bitten. Lan Zhan is <em> kissing him. </em> Wei Ying lets his mouth part under Lan Zhan\u2019s on instinct, pushing back into the kiss. For once, everything has gone silent in his head, immersed in how Lan Zhan feels; the sweet, sticky sound of their mouths catching and releasing; the firm, solid warmth of him, his familiar scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The quiet peels back, Lan Zhan\u2019s voice flooding in: <em> Adore adore adore him </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The intrusion of Lan Zhan\u2019s voice, his <em> thoughts</em>, hits Wei Ying like a douse of cold water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t know this. Any of this. He never should have known \u2014 invading Lan Zhan\u2019s privacy is the only reason he\u2019s here at all, being kissed by the boy he likes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Wei Ying knows what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s shoving Lan Zhan away, panicked at the thought of hearing anything else he shouldn\u2019t. The thump of his hands against Lan Zhan\u2019s chest is audible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he says, quick and shrill and awful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stumbles two steps back; not because Wei Ying is particularly strong, but because he\u2019s been disarmed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The silence after rings out like a slap, like something cruel. Lan Zhan stares at him with his mouth still parted and kiss-red, his expression as stunned and hurt as if Wei Ying had struck him. Wei Ying has gone frozen with horror, his hands suspended.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes another wide step back, putting more distance between them as his familiar guard slides up. His face smoothes over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Wei Ying says weakly. He\u2019s still breathing hard, his head spinning from the kiss. \u201cL-Lan Zhan, I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan presses out a wrinkle in his shirt, dispassionate. Wei Ying can see that his hands are shaking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Lan Zhan says quietly. He won\u2019t look at Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cI <em> can\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you are straight,\u201d Lan Zhan replies in an empty tone of voice. Still not looking at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cNo.\u201d That revelation had been so yesterday evening. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me that way,\u201d Lan Zhan finishes, with a curt nod, and \u2014 when the hell did Lan Zhan get in the habit of interrupting?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Ying repeats, louder, feeling wilder by the second. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all, I just \u2014\u201d He rakes an agitated hand through his wet hair. \u201cYou \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want this, if you knew what I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can hear the unraveling in his own voice, and he must look the part equally, because concern starts to creep into Lan Zhan\u2019s expression, melting the mask of frost that had formed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, more gently. \u201cSlow down. Explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, his hands clenched tight by his sides. He can feel his shoulders are trembling. \u201cI can\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats. He steps toward him as if to touch him again. Wei Ying flinches, and Lan Zhan\u2019s hand stills and retreats, and that\u2019s enough to propel Wei Ying into finally talking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m going to sound insane,\u201d Wei Ying says, burying his face in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m certifiably <em> insane</em>, but I swear I\u2019m telling you the truth, okay?\u201d He swallows and steadies himself, trying to line the words up correctly in his head. \u201cOkay, there\u2019s this \u2014 <em> stupid </em>urban legend that if you\u2019re a thirty-year-old man, and you haven\u2019t, ah \u2014 you\u2019ve never...had sex with someone, then you\u2026\u201d He struggles. \u201cThen you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre cursed,\u201d Lan Zhan finishes, nodding along with Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em> fuck,</em>\u201d Wei Ying says. Apparently everyone knows this is a thing. Whatever. \u201cYes, that. So of course I thought it was a bunch of bullshit, but then I woke up after I turned 30, the morning after my birthday party, and I could \u2014 I found out I could \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s naked worry in Lan Zhan\u2019s face now, like he thinks Wei Ying\u2019s been hurt. God, if only. An injury would be so much easier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can hear people\u2019s thoughts,\u201d Wei Ying says miserably. \u201cWhen I touch them. I\u2019ve been trying to keep my distance from you so I could \u2014 so I wouldn\u2019t intrude on your privacy, but it got <em> really </em>hard to stay away, but I can\u2019t, like, in good conscience do this with you if you don\u2019t know, when I\u2019ve been so dishonest with you, when the only reason I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is just...staring at him. A little disbelievingly, like he thinks Wei Ying may be pulling some elaborate prank. But Wei Ying\u2019s despair must seem genuine enough, because he sobers after another moment, fathomless as he watches Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, hunching his shoulders. \u201cI never meant to \u2014 to know anything you thought about me, but then when I found out you didn\u2019t hate me like I thought, I actually started to like you, and then I just wanted to hang out with you and be your friend, but \u2014 but then yesterday I realized that I don\u2019t want to be friends, I want to be\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts. He sounds unsteady. He sounds panicked, for Lan Zhan. \u201cDo not say anything you do not mean. Please.\u201d He inhales. The sound is tremulous. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing with you,\u201d Wei Ying scrambles to say; he practically lunges forward as he speaks, he\u2019s so emphatic. He feels like he might start crying, which would be humiliating, but the words pour out of him before he can stop it. \u201cI like you; I really, <em> really </em> like you, I think I might \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is in his space again so quickly that Wei Ying\u2019s vision blurs, and he finds himself being crowded against the door and kissed again, Lan Zhan\u2019s hands cupping his face. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes flutter shut as he makes a tiny, hurt sound into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth, surrendering to the force of it \u2014 yes, this is what he needed, this is what he\u2019d been missing before \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been all over the place, he\u2019s yanked them both around this way and that, but suddenly, with Lan Zhan before him \u2014 Lan Zhan, here, after he\u2019d thought he lost him \u2014 Wei Ying has never been more certain of anything. His surety, the clear-cut shape it takes inside him, is startling, <em> new. </em>It hooks into him with teeth, it settles in for a long stay. Yes, Wei Ying thinks, this is it, it\u2019s him, it\u2019s him. He\u2019s been waiting long months and months, years to become this person, to become someone who wants and is wanted. He\u2019s taken his time, the scenic route and its detours, but he\u2019s finally arrived at his destination; he\u2019s stepped out into the sun, into this light of who he\u2019s supposed to be. Loving Lan Zhan had brought him all this way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Zhan finally pulls away, they\u2019re both breathing loudly. Wei Ying is panting like a spent racehorse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hand slides further up his cheek as he looks in his eyes and thinks, a little tentatively, <em> Wei Ying.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, and Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes widen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You can really hear me? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan goes quiet even in his head, his thoughts an indecipherable hum. Then he thinks, more clearly, <em> You have heard all of it? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly when we touched,\u201d Wei Ying says quietly. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m so sorry. I never meant for it to go this far, and I understand if you don\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Zhan\u2019s voice, spoken aloud now, is sudden. His eyes are dark, intent. \u201cDo you want this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth hangs open, then snaps shut. Opens again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cFuck, I really do. But I totally understand if you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t let him finish. Wei Ying claws frantically at Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders under the force of the next kiss, the nice fabric of Lan Zhan\u2019s shirt bunching under his fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I adore you, </em>Lan Zhan\u2019s voice rings out in his head, the words as clear as the peal of a bell, and Wei Ying sucks in a breath, almost choking \u2014 he\u2019s never been addressed like this directly, never been spoken to like this, never \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Wei Ying, I adore you, </em>Lan Zhan thinks to him, louder and surer, even as his mouth is otherwise occupied, prying open Wei Ying\u2019s with his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying slides his hands up the nape of Lan Zhan\u2019s neck, overwhelmed. He feels like he might break down in tears, which would be. Absolutely mortifying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, like the flip of a switch, Lan Zhan is dragging him by the front of his hoodie, bullying Wei Ying through the open door of his bedroom. Wei Ying stumbles a few times as he\u2019s pulled, unwilling to disconnect their mouths even with the sideways jagging of their steps. They keep going blindly until the back of Lan Zhan\u2019s knees hit the mattress and he\u2019s sinking to the edge of the bed, tugging Wei Ying so that he straddles his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has never been on a lap before. Not as an adult \u2014 or if he has, it\u2019s been in jest and probably not while sober. A shiver works through him at how it feels, inarticulate. It makes him feel small. Held. He\u2019s on Lan Zhan\u2019s lap and kissing him with better leverage now, his knees sunken into the bed on either side of Lan Zhan\u2019s thighs, Lan Zhan\u2019s large hands anchored on his hips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so good that he loses time. When Wei Ying has made out with people in the past, with women, he\u2019s always at least semi-aware of the artifice of it, the objective awkwardness of it \u2014 conscious of the movement of his mouth and his hands and his breathing and the taste of the other person\u2019s spit. Top lip, then bottom lip, then top lip again. Making out, up until this point, has always been something generally enjoyable but entirely mechanical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing about making out with Lan Zhan that\u2019s governed, or controlled. His body is like its own animal, his greedy hands roaming with a will of their own, his tongue halfway into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth before he can think it through. The sounds bitten out of him are equally involuntary. He suddenly needs him everywhere, rapacious and impatient, his mouth insufficient to cover the surface area he wants. He can hear the background hum of Lan Zhan\u2019s thoughts, desire and sensation mirrored back at him, <em> through </em> him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying finally pulls back for air, he\u2019s breathing so hard that he\u2019s lightheaded. One of Lan Zhan\u2019s ungentlemanly hands is cupped on his ass, his teeth to Wei Ying\u2019s neck. Fuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you said before,\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs, low against his throat. Wei Ying\u2019s breath is shallow, so loud, almost whistling as he gasps for breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I said when I,\u201d Wei Ying says unintelligibly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout the curse,\u201d Lan Zhan says, then pulls back to survey him closely. \u201cYou have this magic because you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a virgin,\u201d Wei Ying says, pelting out the words quickly in his embarrassment. He glares at Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder so he won\u2019t have to look him in the eye, and squares his jaw. Then he shuts his eyes. \u201cI know given how irresistible and sexy I am that this must come as a shock. But yes, I have never felt the tender touch of a woman, or <em> whatever, </em>you can make fun of me for it if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The expected teasing never comes. Wei Ying cracks an eye open to peek a look at Lan Zhan\u2019s face. Lan Zhan is watching him silently, and there\u2019s a strange light to his features. His eyes are very dark. Wolfish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have never...\u201d Lan Zhan says, his voice three shades huskier than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! That has been! So firmly established by now!\u201d Wei Ying wriggles on Lan Zhan\u2019s lap as if he can curl up and away from view. He feels excruciatingly self-conscious to have his inexperience suddenly under a spotlight. \u201cI mean, okay, fine, I <em> tried, </em>a girl gave me a handjob once and it was fine \u2014 like, technique-wise\u00a0\u2014 it was just that I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He trails off, his face suddenly too hot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods slowly, as though contemplative. \u201cYou did not finish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes an undignified sound, scandalized. \u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>! You can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t say it <em> like that.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lan Zhan asks. The question could be directed at any number of things, so Wei Ying takes a guess at which one he thinks Lan Zhan means.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really sure if I was \u2014 if I was able to,\u201d Wei Ying says. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s having this conversation with Lan Zhan. Regardless of the events of the last fifteen minutes. \u201cWith...another person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods thoughtfully again. \u201cI see.\u201d Then he reaches out, with one hand, to grind the heel of his palm against the bulge in Wei Ying\u2019s jeans, straining against the crotch of his jeans zipper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a high-pitched sound and squirms again, even as his hips rock up into the pressure, seeking friction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMean,\u201d he whines. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You like mean, </em>Lan Zhan observes, his voice suddenly everywhere in Wei Ying\u2019s head, and Wei Ying truly feels something melt and give way in his brain, a crack of heat that splits through him, white-hot. Okay, so it had taken Lan Zhan approximately three seconds to start using this newfound ability for evil.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he protests, even as he hardens further against the circular rhythm of Lan Zhan\u2019s hand. He hears himself whine, some wounded animal sound. Everything below the waist feels alarmingly sticky; he wonders for a slightly unhinged moment if Lan Zhan can feel the wetness of him even through two layers, through denim and cotton. He takes another fleeting second to reflect on whether it\u2019s possible to die from sexual humiliation, and then another to conclude that if so, it\u2019s probably one of the better ways to go, all things considered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is watching him like he wants to eat him alive \u2014 through his lashes, the ring of color in his eyes thinned to black. His lips are slightly parted. Wei Ying watches him back, his own mouth open around his panting, his face so warm that he can feel his pulse in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck, he could get off like this. From almost nothing at all, from sitting fully clothed on Lan Zhan\u2019s lap and rubbing against his hand. The realization of it is a little unmooring; in a split second, Wei Ying realizes he\u2019s not the person he thought he was at all, impotent and tense and awkward in bed. He is a thing that wants, that runs hot, that comes easy under the right touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>He could come like this, </em>Lan Zhan observes at the same time, and Wei Ying says \u201chnnghhh\u201d or something else to the same effect and tries to still the mindless motion of his hips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d Wei Ying tries to stammer out. \u201cI\u2019m not, I don\u2019t usually \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan lifts him by the back of the thighs \u2014 effortlessly, it should be noted \u2014 and Wei Ying makes another unintelligible sound as he clings tight with his elbows and knees. Lan Zhan moves to deposit him on the bed, and Wei Ying bounces once at the rough landing before he\u2019s pinned down again, his hands pressed above his head into the mattress and Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth under his jaw. His head goes floaty and pleasant again, just from being held down like this. Sounds smooth out, even as his own ragged breathing fills his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Lan Zhan is working at the hem of his damp hoodie, and they struggle together to peel it off, the world going briefly dark as it\u2019s yanked over Wei Ying\u2019s head. Then it\u2019s gone, thrown somewhere else in the room, and Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth is back, kissing down the column of his neck to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Ying hears himself saying, \u201cyes, yes, yeah, yes \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Yes, yes, </em> Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking, nearly just as mindless, <em> I want him everywhere\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying needs his pants off, now. The pressure of the fabric has gone from restrictive to downright painful, and he wriggles his hips against Lan Zhan to let him know what he wants. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t hesitate; he pops the button with a twist of his knuckle, then hooks his thumbs into both waistbands to yank Wei Ying\u2019s jeans and boxers down his thighs. Wei Ying makes a small <em> nghhh </em>sound in his throat again as his cock bobs against his belly, already fully hard. Lan Zhan slows his motions, lets his gaze hover, runs a thumb through the smear of precome that glistens around his navel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> So wet, just from this, </em>Lan Zhan muses. The color in his eyes has gone dark, nearly red at the corners.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a hitched, embarrassed sound and covers his blazing face with his hands. \u201c<em>Lan</em> <em>Zhan.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you want it, Wei Ying?\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs. His breath ghosts over Wei Ying\u2019s cock as Wei Ying\u2019s face burns and burns \u2014 Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth is so close, he really shouldn\u2019t \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan presses a kiss to his belly, just above the head of his dick; a tease, not quite touching him where he\u2019s aching for it. Wei Ying\u2019s cock jerks, a blurt of precome that Lan Zhan laps up with his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The temperature of Wei Ying\u2019s face could rival the surface of the sun\u2019s. He practically squeaks. \u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t, you <em> can\u2019t \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d Lan Zhan says in a low voice, then dips lower to tongue the head of his cock, the barest kitten-lick. Wei Ying\u2019s back arches, his fingers frantically clawing into the sheets as he moans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Tell me what you want, </em>Lan Zhan says in his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wants everything, anything, but he\u2019s gasping too hard to put any request into words. The thought of asking for it, begging for <em> that</em>, kills his voice in his throat. It\u2019s too much, too <em> much, </em>he can\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pinches his bare hip, a small sting of pain that recenters his focus. Wei Ying jolts and yelps, hardening further against Lan Zhan\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he wheezes, a little incredulous. He never expected Lan Zhan could be like this, who could have known Lan Zhan would be like this? \u201cI can\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Tell me, </em>Lan Zhan says, in a voice that cannot be refused, and along Wei Ying\u2019s cock, he drags his tongue from root to tip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFfffffuck,\u201d Wei Ying babbles as hips tilt up again, chasing Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth, \u201cyour hands, your fingers, your mouth, please, anything, I don\u2019t care, just \u2014 <em> Lan Zhan \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Anything? </em> Lan Zhan asks, and all at once, a barrage of images crashes through Wei Ying\u2019s head \u2014 Wei Ying on his knees, deep-throating Lan Zhan\u2019s cock with tears in his eyes; Lan Zhan\u2019s tongue licking open the deepest parts of him, messy and wet, while Wei Ying buries his face in his forearms and falls apart with loud keens; Wei Ying tied to a bedpost and blindfolded, and then \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Wei Ying can even catch his breath, Lan Zhan\u2019s moving away, his large hands gripping Wei Ying\u2019s hips to flip him over onto his knees. Wei Ying lets himself be guided into a new placement, a little dazed, a little anxious, so hard that the pain of it has narrowed into a pointed throb. He\u2019s hobbled by the rain-damp jeans still halfway down his thighs, unable to spread his knees for balance, which leaves him face-first in the mattress, his head whirling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something especially vulnerable about this position, where he can\u2019t see Lan Zhan or anything he\u2019s doing, but then Lan Zhan touches him again and suddenly, Wei Ying can see himself through Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes. He watches as well as feels it when Lan Zhan grips one of his cheeks and squeezes it, massages the muscle of it in his palm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Perfect, </em>Lan Zhan thinks, and Wei Ying hides his face in the sheets and smarts with heat, with his own embarrassment and the breathless, unfamiliar burn of this kind of desire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan strips off Wei Ying\u2019s pants and underwear the rest of the way, rolling them down the back of his thighs until they\u2019re gone. Wei Ying lets himself be shifted this way and that, obediently following Lan Zhan\u2019s lead even as a sudden uncertainty hollows out at the center of him, a drop in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, his voice embarrassingly small.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m here, </em>Lan Zhan thinks immediately, and brushes a kiss against the arch of his shoulder, and just like that, the knot of fear in his chest loosens. Lan Zhan wouldn\u2019t hurt him, not in any real way, not in a way he doesn\u2019t want.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Lan Zhan asks aloud, clearly sensing Wei Ying\u2019s trepidation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, shifting so that he sinks deeper into his hip flexors, an unfamiliar stretch. \u201cJust \u2014 nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will make it good,\u201d Lan Zhan promises, the gentleness in his voice so at odds with his curt commands just a moment ago. Wei Ying shifts, breathes deep into his belly; he feels so exposed like this, the cool air of the room brushing against the deepest parts of himself. He\u2019s never been naked like this in front of another person, let alone in such a position, waiting for \u2014 for \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds are heightened when he\u2019s unable to see Lan Zhan \u2014 there\u2019s the crinkle of a packet in Lan Zhan\u2019s hands, his own cock dripping onto the sheets with an audible <em> tap, tap, tap </em> like rain on a sill.<em>\u00a0</em>They haven\u2019t even <em> done </em>anything yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying starts a little when Lan Zhan\u2019s hand cups his backside again. Wei Ying tries to tune into his thoughts, but they\u2019re incoherent flashes of images now, an underwater-sort of distant. Wei Ying jerks harder and makes an unintelligible noise when the pad of Lan Zhan\u2019s finger, wet with an unknown substance, circles his entrance. The sensation is as strange as it is electrifying. Wei Ying has fingered himself before on rare occasions when he\u2019d been feeling adventurous, but the oddity of watching himself through Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes while the actual sensation courses through him produces an odd sense of vertigo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Tight, </em> Lan Zhan notes. Assured, nearly clinical. <em> But not enough that he can\u2019t take me. He will be easy for it. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying splutters in indignation \u2014\u00a0the <em> degradation </em> of it all, of the implication that he\u2019s, he\u2019s \u2014 that he\u2019s like some slut for this, or something \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whines, petulant even as his cock hardens with a sharp throb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I lie,\u201d Lan Zhan returns in a low voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With surprising confidence, Lan Zhan works the first finger inside him, up to the top knuckle. Wei Ying tenses, clenching down around it as Lan Zhan slides it in and out, spreading the wetness inside him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels \u2014 <em> weird.\u00a0</em>Uncomfortable, a little arousing, but mostly just weird.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cL-Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying tries. He can feel he\u2019s red from his forehead to his chest. \u201cAre you \u2014 are you sure that\u2019s really right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t say anything in response. His thoughts have become some horny tangle that Wei Ying can\u2019t unpick, intensifying when Lan Zhan works a second finger inside him. The stretch is suddenly a little terrifying, too much at once in its foreignness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying squirms around the intrusion, his breaths hitching and deepening. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m not sure that you \u2014 it feels a little \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Lan Zhan crooks his fingers and Wei Ying comes, just like that, all over himself and the sheets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a handful of hazy, faraway seconds to realize what\u2019s happened. His mind is still floaty and blank even in the moments after, dandelion-soft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan freezes behind him, the fingers inside Wei Ying going still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just,\u201d Lan Zhan says, then reaches around him to get his other hand on Wei Ying\u2019s cock, which is rapidly softening between his legs. Wei Ying bats his hand away, mortification stinging through him from his head to his toes, so overpowering he can\u2019t even speak. He buries his hot face into the sheets, still panting and reeling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014\u201d Wei Ying says nonsensically, too dazed to defend himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan leans forward, his fingers still buried inside Wei Ying up to the second knuckle, to bite kisses along the column of Wei Ying\u2019s spine, along his shoulders and the nape of his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he rearranges his cognitive abilities, it takes a couple additional moments of these touches for Wei Ying to realize Lan Zhan\u2019s silence is too resolute, while he\u2019s touching him skin-to-skin like this. That all of a sudden, he can\u2019t \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying jolts up in a panic, the back of his head almost crashing into Lan Zhan. \u201c<em>Lan Zhan </em> \u2014 my magic, it\u2019s \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gone. It\u2019s gone. That orgasm must have counted, by the magic\u2019s standards, as lost virginity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How is he supposed to know what Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking now? What if he doesn\u2019t \u2014 what if he changes his mind, and Wei Ying will have no way of knowing \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan shushes him. \u201cWith or without magic, I will stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying chokes out. \u201cI \u2014 okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hesitates, then his fingers slip out of him completely. Wei Ying almost whines at the loss, wriggling his hips \u2014 it feels weirder without them now, too empty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this still something you want?\u201d Lan Zhan asks him, and Wei Ying twists, presses his cheek into the mattress to look at him sideways. Lan Zhan is still fully dressed, his clothes rumpled and his cheeks and ears flushed. He\u2019s so gorgeous that Wei Ying\u2019s breath catches in his throat. It should feel stranger than it does, that Wei Ying is sprawled out beneath him totally naked, having just come all over himself, but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not, <em> somehow</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout the magic,\u201d Lan Zhan clarifies, watching Wei Ying\u2019s face closely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods. He\u2019s sure about this, at least. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to \u2014 to talk me through it. Okay, gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan visibly softens at the pet name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then his fingers slide inside Wei Ying again, the texture of them different from having already been inside him for so long. That\u2019s \u2014 embarrassing. It\u2019s all systems go now, though; Wei Ying exhales as Lan Zhan opens him up, his head ducked against his forearms. He breathes through the strangeness and the occasional discomfort, and the unexpected spikes of pleasure that make him seize up, still twitchy with oversensitivity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few more minutes, Wei Ying hears a rustle of fabric, the metallic shing of Lan Zhan\u2019s zipper splaying open, although Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers remain inside him. He peeks a look through the gap under his arm. Lan Zhan\u2019s seen all of the most private parts of him now, so it\u2019s only fair that Wei Ying can finally see what his dick looks like, after years of secret wondering, after having felt the shape of it through his pants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s apparently not wearing any underwear, which \u2014 <em> he knew it, </em>but part of Wei Ying fizzles out anyway, at the hotness of that. But when Lan Zhan reaches into his pants and pulls out his cock, all other thoughts fly out of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had always known he would be big \u2014 simply something about Lan Zhan\u2019s energy had lent him that idea \u2014 but he hadn\u2019t expected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monstrous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Wei Ying hears himself say, and Lan Zhan locks eyes with him, his mouth parting slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying feels a semi-hysterical laugh bubbling up in his throat, mostly because. What the fuck. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s going to \u2014 uh. Fit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will fit,\u201d Lan Zhan replies, the confidence in his voice so assured that Wei Ying\u2019s dick gives a responding twitch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to break me,\u201d Wei Ying says, blood thumping in his face. He doesn\u2019t miss the way Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes flash at this, and \u2014 oh. \u201cLan Zhan, have you ever considered doing porn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sees Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth twitch, but Wei Ying\u2019s focus hasn\u2019t wavered from his cock. The way Lan Zhan absently strokes himself with a large hand, from the base all the way to the flushed head. Wei Ying\u2019s mouth waters; he wants to get his mouth on it. The thought of sucking dick has always seemed vaguely repulsive to him, in the abstract way in which all sex was, but with Lan Zhan, it\u2019s...different. Presented with the real prospect, Wei Ying\u2019s stance wavers. It definitely won\u2019t taste great, but it would probably feel good if Lan Zhan just \u2014 used him that way, fucked his mouth open until he couldn\u2019t breathe or swallow, until he was gagging around it \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan says in answer to his question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you should consider it,\u201d Wei Ying says. He\u2019s babbling now to distract himself. Maybe he could offer to suck Lan Zhan\u2019s cock to distract him from wanting to put it inside him. It would probably work, even. \u201cYou\u2019d make a killing at it. Not all of us are so naturally endowed, hahaha \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, a line forming between his eyebrows. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should do that, shouldn\u2019t he. Wei Ying takes a deep breath, lets it settle into his lungs and each of his limbs. This will only hurt more if he doesn\u2019t relax. Regardless of the inevitable pain, he does still want it. It surprises him, how much he wants it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hand rests on his bare hip, and Wei Ying flinches a bit, squeezes his eyes shut and bites his lip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you ever need me to stop,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cSay so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods twice in quick succession, and holds his breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan knee-walks forward on the mattress. His large hand slides further up Wei Ying\u2019s thigh, tugging him backward along the sheets with ease, like Wei Ying is putty in his hands. Shit. Maybe he is, maybe he really is. Lan Zhan could snap him in half without even trying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the rustling sound of Lan Zhan adjusting, and then Lan Zhan taps the head of his cock to Wei Ying\u2019s hole. Wei Ying full-body jerks at the sensation with a wheezy sound. He can hear Lan Zhan\u2019s breathing has staggered, can feel his gaze on him like a paperweight, a smooth and rounded pressure pinning him in place. Lan Zhan\u2019s hand finds his hip, big enough to splay over the entire width of it. Then he pushes in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hurts. It would hurt in any scenario, but Lan Zhan\u2019s size makes it impossible that it wouldn\u2019t. Wei Ying had never imagined in his life, ever, that he would be taken by a man this way, and the reality of it, of a cock inside him, is suddenly as surreal as the fact that Lan Zhan is the owner of it. Wei Ying pants into the hollow of his arms as Lan Zhan sinks into him in painfully slow increments. His fingers clench and unclench in the sheets around the onslaught of sensation; the slide is still a little too dry in spite of the lube, and Wei Ying clenches his teeth around it. He feels completely split open, speared straight through to his spine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pauses when Wei Ying\u2019s breath goes shallow, too high and loud in his throat. He runs a soothing hand up Wei Ying\u2019s side, tracing along his hip and outer thigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it in yet?\u201d Wei Ying asks. He barely recognizes his own voice. It\u2019s reedy, nasal, a little hysterical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHalfway,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and Wei Ying whines, shudders in disbelief. <em> That\u2019s </em>half? How can he possibly be expected to take more?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I pull out?\u201d Lan Zhan asks, oh-so-kindly despite the strained note in his voice, and Wei Ying gives a quick, emphatic shake of his head. As much as he can\u2019t imagine taking the rest of it, the idea of being suddenly empty is somehow far worse. Besides, Wei Ying\u2019s no fucking quitter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he says, keeping his tone as light as he can. \u201cYou can keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hesitates. His breathing cadence has shifted, steepened from before. So it\u2019s not just Wei Ying \u2014 he\u2019s having an effect on Lan Zhan, after all. Wei Ying suddenly wishes he could see him, the red tips of his ears and the expressions he\u2019d make, maybe the way his mouth would fall open and his eyes would scrunch shut with his pleasure. He wants to watch Lan Zhan come undone in front of him, <em> because </em>of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next time, Wei Ying thinks, with a rush of conviction. They have time to try everything, in all of the ways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shifts, inching in deeper \u2014 he has so much restraint, taking him so slowly when surely the feeling of being inside him is maddening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, feeling magnanimous and grandly sympathetic. \u201cTake what you need from me, Lan Zhan, you don\u2019t have to hold back, I can take it \u2014 take you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying clenches as he speaks, so tight that Lan Zhan makes a muffled, moaned sound. Then he slides the rest of the way in, and Wei Ying knows it\u2019s the end of it because he can feel, with an absurd shock of heat, the scratchy fabric of his bunched slacks against the backs of his thighs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d taken all of it. Wei Ying is at once crisply aware of every sensation in his body, each vying for his attention; the sweat quickly cooling in the dip of his back, the twinge of his hips and thighs stretched in this unfamiliar position, the arch of his bowed spine aching. Lan Zhan, pressed against every nerve ending inside of him, a push-pull of pleasure-pain. There\u2019s something indescribably heady about his body\u2019s ability to open for Lan Zhan this way, like maybe he was made for this, made for him \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, an uneven hitch in his voice. He sounds discomposed for the first time, halfway to wrecked. A tremor works through them both, and Wei Ying can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s his own muscles shaking at the strain of holding his position, or if it\u2019s Lan Zhan trembling against him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reaches back, blindly fumbling, to squeeze Lan Zhan\u2019s thigh, to say <em> I\u2019m good, </em>to anchor himself. Lan Zhan wraps one hand around Wei Ying\u2019s and squeezes, the other still fitted along the crease between his hipbone and upper thigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan keeps their hands joined as he rocks forward, a shallow grind. It hurts until it doesn\u2019t, until the pain smoothes out into a sensation that\u2019s sparky and molten, a heavy simmer in the deepest parts of him. Different from the pleasure of when he\u2019d come on Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers, or from when he touches himself. Wei Ying realizes, somewhat distantly, that at some point during this he\u2019s gotten hard again, a pointed ache between his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, Wei Ying thinks, this isn\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s starting to feel good, even \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Lan Zhan starts to properly fuck him. Those first few minutes, Wei Ying now understands, had been experimental, <em> gentle, </em>considerately letting Wei Ying get adjusted to the feeling of him. At the first real thrust, Wei Ying\u2019s mind whites out, empties itself. And then it just \u2014 doesn\u2019t stop, this inescapable fullness. It\u2019s sort of like the drop off a roller coaster, the zero-to-hundred sensation, and all he can do is ride it all the way through, until the end \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere through the daze of incoherence, he realizes, not quite in full words, that he enjoys it. He <em> likes </em>being used this way, to feel good at doing it, to feel wanted and desired and claimed. The physical pain of it is secondary to that deep-space sensation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarder,\u201d he hears himself say, even as he wheezes for breath, even as his limbs shake and shake. \u201cL-Lan Zhan, more, please, harder \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan seals one hand to the back of his neck and pushes so that Wei Ying\u2019s face is pressed tight into the sheets. It makes it nearly impossible to breathe, his windpipe sealing tight. His thoughts space again at the sensation, rolling away from him like marbles on glass. His breaths rattle, through the mindlessness of pleasure like this, as Lan Zhan heeds his request. Wei Ying can hear the noises he\u2019s making, the harsh wheeze of his breathing whistling through his teeth, his mouth open around his gasps; he can feel spit trailing down his cheek, but he\u2019s too far gone to close his mouth, too gone to do anything except take what he\u2019s given, to try to process sensation. He\u2019s got his fingers bunched in the sheets, a mindless flexing and loosening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This would usually be an exchange where Wei Ying talks, where he teases and taunts and shoots his mouth off to fill space, but it\u2019s like his motor functions have frazzled straight through. He can't utter a single thing, other than some of the inhuman noises he's making. Lan Zhan is still mostly silent, other than his own frayed breathing and the rhythmic smack of his hips against the back of Wei Ying\u2019s thighs. Too quiet, quiet for the first time in days, Wei Ying needs to...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes him a few attempts to form words. They come out slurred, a little mangled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cL-Lh \u2014 Lan Zha\u2019,\u201d he tries, and Lan Zhan slows his pace, maybe concerned that Wei Ying\u2019s hurt. \u201cCan you \u2014 t-tell me? What you, you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He butchers the question, but Lan Zhan seems to understand his intent, his pace picking up again with a sharp drive of his hips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d Lan Zhan huffs, each breath punctuated by another thrust, \u201cthat Wei Ying is as good as I imagined.\u201d He grinds his cock deeper into him, the deepest thrust yet. Stars pop in Wei Ying\u2019s vision, and he cries out, wordless and wild. \u201cThat you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Lan Zhan leans across Wei Ying\u2019s back, the angle pressing different and strange inside him, to bite the back of Wei Ying\u2019s neck. \u201cThat you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s second orgasm hits with the next thrust; he shakes silently through it, open-mouthed around a soundless cry, tears from oversensitivity spilling from the corners of his eyes as Lan Zhan fucks him through it. He can feel Lan Zhan when follows him just seconds later with a grunt, gripping Wei Ying\u2019s hips tight enough to bruise as a burst of wet heat pulses inside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, they breathe together, Lan Zhan slowly going half-soft inside him \u2014 Wei Ying can feel he\u2019s still coming, just a little bit \u2014 Wei Ying trembling so hard that it feels like his bones are rattling. They're suspended, shaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Lan Zhan slides out of him. Wei Ying makes a sound of protest, squirming at the sudden hollowness, at the uncomfortable trickle of wet that seeps out of him. It trails down his perineum and the insides of his thighs. Lan Zhan\u2019s thumb spreads him open, as though surveying his handiwork, and Wei Ying\u2019s too hazy to react with the appropriate shame that he should, that he usually would. Lan Zhan can do whatever he wants to him, so long as Wei Ying can float in this pool of white-edged silence, each of his thoughts blissfully quiet and distant for the first time he can remember.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stays quiet as Lan Zhan lies down to pull him tight against his chest, showering kisses along his sweat-damp hair and the back of his neck and his ears. The material of Lan Zhan\u2019s work-clothes is kind of scratchy against Wei Ying\u2019s flushed skin. Every sensation feels heightened, in this state,\u00a0 but it\u2019s soothing, anchoring to be held so tightly, to be kissed and coddled and caressed with such care. He feels wine-drunk, or like a cat stretched out in the sun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says after another breathless moment. His voice is low, a little choked. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This finally prompts Wei Ying to move, to muster up the last dregs of his energy. He twists in Lan Zhan\u2019s arms so that they\u2019re level with each other, so that Wei Ying can <em> finally </em>see his face. He\u2019s still flushed, aglow, his eyes bright like he\u2019s been illuminated from within. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes skim over his features in turn, flickering to take in each detail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it as good as your fantasies?\u201d Wei Ying asks, a little apprehensive. He thinks he knows the answer, but the performance pressure had been high, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Lan Zhan assures him, and kisses him between the eyebrows. \u201cFar better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods once in satisfaction, smug to have that over his imaginary self, and burrows deeper into Lan Zhan\u2019s chest with a sigh. Lan Zhan\u2019s heart is still thrumming quickly, rabbiting against his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, can you,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles. His words are all soupy. \u201cCan you take this off?\u201d Between his finger and thumb, he twists one of the small resin buttons digging into his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan makes an assenting sound in his throat before he sits up and slides out of his shirt, then he kicks off his pants the rest of the way. He lies back down again, and they\u2019re skin to skin for the first time, Lan Zhan\u2019s hand stroking along Wei Ying\u2019s back with an intimacy that feels so oddly familiar already. Wei Ying drowses into it as he catches his breath, endorphins still singing through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can finally touch you without feeling guilty about it,\u201d Wei Ying admits a moment later. He presses his cheek against Lan Zhan\u2019s chest. He feels strangely shy in a way he\u2019s never experienced before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuilty?\u201d Lan Zhan asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe magic,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cIt felt wrong to know what you were thinking all the time, especially when it was...I tried to not intrude where I could.\u201d He pauses to think for a moment, although he keeps getting distracted by the lull of Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers along his skin, a soothing rhythm. \u201cYou took that really well, by the way. The whole mind-reading thing, I mean. Most people would have called me a nutcase and kicked me out the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would not lie,\u201d Lan Zhan says simply. \u201cAnd stranger things have happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given their choice in career, that\u2019s a true statement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cAre you sure, you\u2019re...okay about all of it? I know it\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have nothing to hide from you,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. He hesitates, then continues, more haltingly, \u201cI am not skilled with words, on subjects like this. Perhaps it was fortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying keeps his face hidden in Lan Zhan\u2019s chest, his voice muffled. \u201cWould you have ever told me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pauses again, then admits, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Wei Ying hurries to say. \u201cThe hypotheticals of what would have happened. I\u2019m just really glad it did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs, then presses his lips to the top of Wei Ying\u2019s head. Wei Ying closes his eyes, drifting again for a moment. He can already feel a deep soreness settling in, both in unspeakable places and in muscles he didn\u2019t know he had.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to carry me around tomorrow, gege,\u201d he says, sniffing for dramatic effect. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, in a tone that demonstrates zero penitence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying thinks hard for another moment, Lan Zhan\u2019s chest rising and falling beneath him. It\u2019s difficult to herd coherent thoughts when all he wants to do is sleep, but the belated shock of the last hour\u2019s events is still primary. His first time. His first...everything, really. He\u2019d always expected that losing his virginity would be perfunctory, an uncomfortable but necessary rite of passage. He had certainly never imagined, at least consciously, losing it to Lan Zhan. To have enjoyed it so much comes as something of a small shock. It\u2019s becoming more and more evident that he might be a person who actually enjoys sex. All of its inherent discomforts and intimacies and messiness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we really did that,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, and Lan Zhan tenses ever so slightly, so he\u2019s quick to add, \u201cI\u2019m happy we did. It\u2019s just \u2014 I never would have thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNor I,\u201d Lan Zhan says softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have plenty of evidence to the contrary on that one,\u201d Wei Ying teases him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan huffs into his hair but gives a small shake of his head. \u201cBut I \u2014 I never thought you would really\u2026that we could\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs. \u201cFor putting you through hell over this. For taking so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo apologies,\u201d Lan Zhan says softly, and strokes a hand through his drying hair. \u201cI did not mind the wait. It meant knowing you more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns his face into Lan Zhan\u2019s chest and stays buried there for a couple moments.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he mumbles, when he\u2019s halfway recovered. \u201cI really like you too much. I can\u2019t believe it took thinking you wanted to fuck Su She for me to come around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan makes a dark, revolted sound in his throat. \u201cI do not want to owe him anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying concedes with a laugh. \u201cI liked you earlier than that, okay? I\u2019ve always really actually liked you, you know. Even when we were supposed to hate each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI never hated you,\u201d Lan Zhan protests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying taps his nose in admonishment, a gentle bop. \u201cNot true. Remember that day you found out I was messing around with alternate cultivation? God, I thought you were going to wring my neck. I literally saw my life flash before my eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI worried for you,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and a breath presses slowly out of him, a heavy sound. \u201cYou weren\u2019t eating or sleeping. I could see the toll it was taking. I did not know how to voice it, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks, then says blankly, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI never hated you,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, quieter than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying goes quiet for another moment, digesting this, before he says, \u201cSo if we both never really hated each other, I guess that means we\u2019ve both always...kind of liked each other? Actually?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s silence speaks volumes. It feels a little long-suffering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reflects on this for another moment, turning through some of their earlier days with this new perspective. It also means that...more recently...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, distracted by the memory. \u201cThat time when you, ah. When you.\u201d How can he possibly still blush, after everything they just did to each other? His skin feels like a lit stovetop. \u201cWhen you thought about gagging me, and tying me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich time,\u201d Lan Zhan says, completely serious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe \u2014 you \u2014\u201d Wei Ying mouth flops open, then shut as he flusters more by the second. \u201cThe time in the \u2014 in the break room, the day after my birthday, when I was on your nerves and you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Lan Zhan says in a comprehending tone, as though pulling that mental file from the archives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the time, I freaked out,\u201d Wei Ying admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what it meant. But now that I...that we\u2019ve\u2026\u201d He swallows. <em> Just say it, Wei Ying, you idiot, just say it. </em> \u201cI think I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He goes quiet, struggling with how to voice this foreign thing, this new shape of want.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan prompts, a low murmur. He sounds intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I might like it,\u201d Wei Ying says finally, unable to look Lan Zhan in the eye. \u201cIf we tried that. I think it would...be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There. He\u2019d said it. His skin is so warm. He feels like he\u2019s just confessed to something he doesn\u2019t know the full gravity of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shifts against him, pulling Wei Ying tighter to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we will try it,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We. We will try it. We will. Wei Ying turns over the implicit comfort of the words, that built-in structure of promise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Wei Ying says, relaxing at Lan Zhan\u2019s assurance. \u201cI think. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither of us have to know,\u201d Lan Zhan says reasonably. \u201cWe have time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time. Yeah, they do. There\u2019s the promise of so much time with Lan Zhan, now. The thought fills Wei Ying with a bubbly, soda-water feeling, buoyant and exhilarating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, and shifts with a wince. <em> God, </em>he\u2019s sore everywhere. And he could really use a cleanup. But he\u2019s too tired to even lift a finger; he can only move his mouth and mumble out nonsense. \u201cI hope you know that I\u2019m not going to leave you alone now. I hope you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and the sound is strangely choked. He pauses a moment, then says, softer, \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs. He\u2019s listing toward a nap, or maybe some deeper sleep, and then he\u2019s slipping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His last words are a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So. Some notable things have changed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is two months past thirty. He\u2019s no longer a virgin,\u00a0at least fifteen (and a half) times over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also no longer a heterosexual. Both status changes had developed surprisingly quickly, but he\u2019s not complaining about either of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nor the other one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is the fact that he has a boyfriend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A boyfriend who\u2019s extremely evil and unexpectedly misbehaved, who has him against an alcove wall \u2014 in their <em> place of business </em> \u2014 that\u2019s not nearly as hidden as it should be for what he\u2019s doing to Wei Ying. They\u2019ve already been threatened with a restraining order by Jiang Cheng for such acts of public indecency. Huaisang would probably just gloat, even more than he\u2019s already been doing. Mianmian might send a fruit basket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says breathlessly, as Lan Zhan lightly sucks a linear trail of hickies down his collarbone, just beneath his shirt. \u201cLan Zhaaan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pulls back, his ears flushed and his mouth dark, and waits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying flutters a look at him from under his eyelashes. \u201cLan Zhan. Can you tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question has become sort of an ongoing joke between them, one that Lan Zhan usually indulges unless he\u2019s feeling especially mean. As miserable as the magic had often made him, Wei Ying does miss it, sometimes \u2014 hearing what Lan Zhan\u2019s thinking under the mask. But he enjoys the challenge of having to guess at Lan Zhan\u2019s silences now, which he\u2019s getting better and better at decrypting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does Wei Ying ask what he already knows?\u201d Lan Zhan wonders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes widen in mock affront. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything at all. I\u2019ve never had a single thought, in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He leans in again, his large hand sliding into Wei Ying\u2019s back pocket to reel him in closer, then answers Wei Ying\u2019s question, low in his ear. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his bedroom voice. Unquestionably. Wei Ying\u2019s toes curl in his shoes, blood rushing helplessly to his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d he says faintly. Lan Zhan brushes his lips over the frantically pounding pulse on Wei Ying\u2019s neck, the barest kiss. \u201cTh-that\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tracks his reaction with thinly veiled amusement, eyeing his blush. \u201cYou already knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s different when you say it out <em> loud, </em>\u201d Wei Ying whines, and claps a feeble hand to Lan Zhan\u2019s chest. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m feeling very faint all of a sudden. Would you catch me if I swooned right here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s hand tightens in Wei Ying\u2019s back pocket, a firm squeeze as he trails his mouth up Wei Ying\u2019s neck. \u201cLike you,\u201d he murmurs, then with a nip to his jaw, repeats, \u201cLike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just from the two words, Wei Ying feels a giddy bolt of satisfaction. He\u2019s been had several times by now, in several and continuously evolving ways, but, like. Lan Zhan has a crush on him. The rush of it hasn\u2019t worn off yet, to like someone so much and be liked back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what is Wei Ying thinking?\u201d Lan Zhan asks. His eyes are strangely soft, honeyed. Under the full brunt of that gaze, Wei Ying has to wonder, again, how he\u2019d missed it, all of those times before. Lan Zhan has never been as loud as this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I think of you,\u201d Wei Ying teases, and tiptoes into Lan Zhan\u2019s space so he can hook his arms around his neck. \u201cAre you so insatiable that you\u2019ll make me say it out loud, er-gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan catches him around the waist, his voice dropping to a hum. \u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying could fill a book with what he thinks of Lan Zhan. Several books. Maybe one day, he will. For now, it\u2019s enough just to tell him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens his mouth, and he begins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
