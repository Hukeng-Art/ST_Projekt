  "summary": "<p>Izuku doesn't know why the day keeps resetting. He doesn't know why he's trapped on campus, or why there's no phone reception, or why Aizawa and Shinsou keep losing their memories of the Saturdays they've already lived, while Izuku remains constantly, painfully aware. </p>\n<p>But he does know this: Aizawa and Shinsou keep dying, over and over again, in more brutal and creative ways. And it's his job to save them.</p>",

  "text": "<p>An inhuman scream splits the evening air. It sounds like nothing Izuku has heard before, but the noise touches something deep inside him, like someone crying out for help.</p>\n<p>Aizawa levels a hard stare at Izuku and Shinsou, and says, \u201cStay here,\u201d before he dashes into an alleyway, scarf rising as he runs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shinsou says, \u201cfuck that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku catches his arm. Shinsou jerks in his hold, his shopping bags swinging back to thump against Izuku\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have your provisional license,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Shinsou shakes him off. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not going to just stand here while Aizawa-sensei runs into danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou darts after Aizawa before Izuku can finish. His white shopping bags glow in the dim alleyway. Izuku shoves his own bags further up his arms and sprints after him.</p>\n<p>He finds Aizawa crouched over a woman. She\u2019s not moving. Shinsou is stood a few metres back, breathing hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d Aizawa instructs, pulling his fingers away from her neck. He must have been checking for a pulse.</p>\n<p>There are no signs of an attack. No blood. No visible injuries. Just a thin layer of dust covering the entire alleyway, so fine it\u2019s almost translucent. It shimmers under the fading sun.</p>\n<p>Shinsou steps forward. \u201cIs she ...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said don\u2019t look,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Izuku glances around the alleyway. Maybe the woman had overdosed or had a medical emergency, but he can\u2019t forget that piercing sound. What had made that noise?</p>\n<p>A shadow flits behind Aizawa\u2019s crouched form. Izuku lunges forward, One for All burning up his legs, and plants himself in front of Shinsou and Aizawa.</p>\n<p>A tennis ball thumps against his chest.</p>\n<p>Izuku picks it up. When he looks to see who had thrown it, he doesn\u2019t see anyone at the other end of the alleyway. Just pedestrians, obliviously walk past the alley where a woman lays dead.</p>\n<p>Shinsou plucks the tennis ball out of his hands. He turns it over. \u201cMust\u2019ve have come from a neighbourhood kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everything is an attack, Midoriya,\u201d Aizawa scoulds, taking the tennis ball. He seems distracted. There\u2019s a body in the middle of the city, after all. And Aizawa has two students with him. \u201cYou need to calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku ducks his head. \u201cSorry, sensei.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa throws the tennis ball back at him. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. Just don\u2019t let yourself become paranoid. Jumpy heroes can hurt people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods. He turns the ball over in his hand. It looks like any normal tennis ball, but when he rubs his fingers together, they feel slick and shimmer strangely in the fading sun, like oil clings to his skin. Strange.</p>\n<p>Aizawa calls the police to handle the body. Izuku shoves the tennis ball in his pocket, where he forgets all about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku fumbles for his phone. Its light almost blinds him and he winces, rubbing his eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a message from All Might.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I won\u2019t be able to train with you today. Nezu has asked that I stay at the Hero Conference for another day to help with PR. But I should be back tomorrow! Maybe today you could train with Aizawa instead? Sorry, my boy!</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s 7:44am. Izuku already knows he won\u2019t be able to go back to sleep. He props himself up against the headboard and types up a reply.</p>\n<p>\n<em>That\u2019s okay! Have fun at the conference. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.</em>\n</p>\n<p>His phone buzzes. <em>Message failed to send.</em></p>\n<p>Huh. UA usually has great reception.</p>\n<p>Izuku puts his phone down, frowning. If his phone isn\u2019t working, he won\u2019t be able to message his friends and ask if they want to meet up. Everyone else has gone home for the long weekend. The only reason Izuku had elected to stay at the dorms was so that he could spend all weekend training with All Might. His mum had already made alternative plans.</p>\n<p>He sighs up at the ceiling. What now?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku heads downstairs. Seeing the dorms so empty and quiet\u2014it\u2019s eerie. He keeps expecting to round the corner and see a half-asleep Uraraka hanging off Tsuyu or hear Iida corralling everyone towards the kitchen for breakfast.</p>\n<p>There is someone in the kitchen, but he\u2019s not one of Izuku\u2019s classmates.</p>\n<p>Shinsou is rifling through the fridge. The countertop is littered with diced spinach and coconut. A jar of Kacchan\u2019s protein powder sits by the blender.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you supposed to be here?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Shinsou flinches, hitting his head on the top of the fridge. He pulls back, scowling, rubbing his temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shinsou bites out. \u201cAizawa-sensei said I could. The 1-C kitchen is empty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan isn\u2019t there to yell at Shinsou for touching his protein powder, so Izuku just shrugs and grabs a water bottle out of the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you still training with Aizawa today?\u201d Izuku asks. Shinsou loads everything into the blender, not looking at Izuku. He nods tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. I was supposed to be training with All Might today, but he had to cancel. Maybe I could join you and we could\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou turns the blender on. The screeching whir drowns out Izuku\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>He hovers by the fridge, watching Shinsou\u2019s smoothie froth up. Shinsou doesn\u2019t switch the blender off, even when everything is combined. The noise grates at his senses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s done,\u201d Izuku shouts over the blender.</p>\n<p>Shinsou reluctantly turns it off. He unscrews a plastic bottle patterned with tiny Thirteens.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Uraraka has that same water bottle but in pink,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAre you a big Thirteen fan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hops from foot to foot as Shinsou pours his smoothie into the bottle. He\u2019s never been good at making conversation. Before UA, the only person who would willingly talk to him was his mum.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a big hero fan too,\u201d Izuku blurts. \u201cAll Might is my favourite, but I think all heroes are cool. Is-is Thirteen your favourite?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEraserhead\u2019s my favourite,\u201d Shinsou says, screwing the cap onto his smoothie. \u201cI prefer underground heroes. A lot of mainstream heroes are too \u2026 obnoxious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou\u2019s smile is sharp. Izuku gets the distinct impression he\u2019s being laughed at. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he can ask what Shinsou means by that, the front door swings open and Aizawa trudges in.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>Shinsou shoves the blender in the sink and grabs his smoothie. He nods tightly. \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-wait!\u201d Aizawa\u2019s gaze flicks to him, and Izuku tries not to falter under the weight of that stare.</p>\n<p>Izuku knows he\u2019s difficult to like. Teachers, especially, find him irritating. He\u2019s too much trouble. He\u2019s always been too much trouble.</p>\n<p>But the thought of spending the day rattling around the dorms, the silence eating away at him, compels him to shove down his anxiety and ask, \u201cCan I join you? All Might is still at the Hero Conference. He won\u2019t be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa glances at Shinsou, scowling down at his smoothie, and then back at Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cB-But\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have tomorrow with All Might,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cTake a break today. If you must, you can work out in the gyms around campus, but don\u2019t overdo it. Recovery Girl isn\u2019t here to piece you back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shrinks in on himself. Under Aizawa\u2019s flat gaze, he feels small but also like he takes up too much space.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Aizawa says, like he doesn\u2019t believe him. Then he turns to Shinsou. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods, jaw set, and follows Aizawa out of the dorms. Izuku hovers in the kitchen after they\u2019ve gone. Now that he\u2019s well and truly alone, the dorms feel foreign. Unwelcoming.</p>\n<p>So Izuku does what he always does when he\u2019s anxious: he trains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Izuku had chosen another gym, he wouldn\u2019t have known. UA is full of training facilities. He could have picked one on the other side of campus, well out of hearing range.</p>\n<p>Around noon, when Izuku is hunched over his knees, sucking in air and berating himself for not being stronger, he hears it. A scream.</p>\n<p>He sprints out of the gym. He hears the shriek of metal-on-metal and raised voices. With a burst of One for All, he follows the sound into a neighbouring gym.</p>\n<p>Inside this gym is a small derelict industrial area, maybe a fifth of the size Izuku is used to working with in class. And there\u2019s Shinsou, at the top of a construction site, clinging to a buckling cement wall. Scaffolding is collapsing under him and, like a stray thread unravelling a sweater, it\u2019s taking the rest of the building down with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Aizawa calls up at him. He\u2019s scaling the swaying building as quickly as he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d Shinsou shouts back.</p>\n<p>Aizawa isn\u2019t going to make it. Izuku can already see the seams of the building coming loose, the cement warping beyond repair.</p>\n<p>He throws himself forward, electricity tasting like bile in his throat, but he\u2019s too far away and the structure is too unstable. Aizawa grabs Shinsou\u2019s hand just as the building collapses in on itself.</p>\n<p>Cement dust billows up around them. He hurls himself at the rubble, hacking up the dust in his lungs. He digs and digs and digs through the debris.</p>\n<p>He sees Shinsou first. It looks like Aizawa twisted them around as they fell so that he took the brunt of the impact, but it still hadn\u2019t saved Shinsou. A metal rod juts out of his abdomen, skewering him above his hip bone. His legs are twisted under the rubble.</p>\n<p>Aizawa is only half-visible beneath him, but even from this angle, Izuku can tell that his neck is broken.</p>\n<p>In class, they\u2019re taught to prioritise. Civilians with life-threatening injuries take precedent over minor wounds or\u2014or people who have already died.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou can\u2019t save the dead,\u201d</em> Aizawa had told them once, looking tired and frighteningly serious. <em>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop and mourn them when there are people that still need your help. You have to keep moving, no matter what.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It was a harsh lesson for a class of sixteen year olds to hear. But Class 1-A was often on the frontlines and Aizawa had to prepare them for the inevitable.</p>\n<p>For this.</p>\n<p>Izuku fumbles with the collar of Shinsou\u2019s costume. He finds a thready pulse, weak enough that it scares him.</p>\n<p>Izuku reaches for his phone, but then remembers he left it in the dorms. He rummages through Shinsou\u2019s utility belt, careful not to jostle the iron rod protruding above his hip. He finds Shinsou\u2019s mobile. It\u2019s sticky, blood seeping into the grooves in the keyboard. He just hopes the circurity hasn\u2019t been affected.</p>\n<p>He calls 119. The phone rings and rings and rings. After a few minutes, Izuku hangs up and tries again. Then he tries 110. That doesn\u2019t work either. He tries All Might. In a fit of desperation, he tries calling his mum.</p>\n<p>No one picks up.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t move Shinsou. If he does, he\u2019ll bleed out before help can arrive.</p>\n<p><em>If</em> help will arrive.</p>\n<p>Izuku sprints back to the dorms using One for All, faster than he\u2019s ever moved before, and finds his phone on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>He tries every emergency number he can remember. He rings All Might, Gran Torino, Mirio, Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>Of all the days for the reception to be down\u2026</p>\n<p>He runs back to the dorms, his vision swimming around the edges. Everything is just as he left it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku says, light-headed, though no one is awake to hear him. He reaches for Shinsou\u2019s pale throat again.</p>\n<p>This time, he can\u2019t find a pulse.</p>\n<p>He searches blindly for another minute but he still can\u2019t find a pulse. He tries Shinsou\u2019s left wrist. His right one. Nothing.</p>\n<p>The ground is rocking violently beneath him, like a boat tossed about in a sudden storm.</p>\n<p>His vision fades as he\u2019s staring down at his hands. One of his fingernails is missing. Blood has dripped down to his elbows, and all he can think about, as the ground is rushing up to meet him, is that he doesn\u2019t know if the blood is his or Shinsou\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Midoriya sits up. His phone says it\u2019s Saturday. 7:44am. A text message from All Might blinks up at him, the same one he spent hours thinking about yesterday.</p>\n<p>His hands are unmarked and clean. He\u2019s in bed, his curtains pulled shut, his All Might plush propped in arms-reach by his pillow. But he doesn\u2019t remember going to bed.</p>\n<p>He remembers Shinsou and Aizawa dying, though. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever forget that.</p>\n<p>As if in a trance, he dials All Might\u2019s number. The phone rings endlessly in his ear. He gives up. Tries his mum. Tries Recovery Girl. Tries the police.</p>\n<p>Even though he remembers Aizawa\u2019s unseeing eyes, blood dribbling out of his tear-ducts, he dials Aizawa\u2019s number.</p>\n<p>Aizawa picks up after the first ring. \u201cMidoriya, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares sightlessly at the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya?\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku says, even though something clearly is. \u201cNo, everything\u2019s fine, sensei.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Aizawa says, though he sounds heistant. Like he doesn\u2019t believe Izuku. \u201cI\u2019m heading to the dorms to pick Shinsou up now. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Izuku mumbles, and then hangs up.</p>\n<p>He takes the elevator down to the living room. He knew Shinsou would be in the kitchen; Aizawa had told him on the phone that that was where he was.</p>\n<p>But he remembers, too vividly to have been deja vu, Shinsou making this exact smoothie, glaring at the countertop to avoid looking at him.</p>\n<p>He also remembers him dying. But there Shinsou stands, clearly alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shinsou greets. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku crowds Shinsou against the fridge and pickpockets his phone. He calls a random number\u2014Uraraka, this time\u2014and feels sick when it rings out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Midoriya?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou snatches his phone back and shoves Izuku, reversing their positions. Izuku\u2019s back hits the fridge. The magnets rattle beneath him and Kaminari\u2019s test (an impressive B- in Hero Law) falls to the ground.</p>\n<p>Izuku stares at Shinsou. He barely registers the barred teeth, the elbow pressed into his sternum. All he can see is Shinsou\u2019s body half-buried in rubble, his mouth open just slightly, like he was in the middle of forming words when he died.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Izuku\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s apologising for stealing Shinsou\u2019s phone or for\u2014something else.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you wanted to borrow my phone, you could\u2019ve just asked,\u201d Shinsou says, eyeing him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scrubs a hand over his face. \u201cYeah. Sorry. I think I just \u2026 had another nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods and steps out of his personal space. \u201cHappens to all of us. But don\u2019t do that to me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Shinsou goes back to making his smoothie. Izuku watches him for a moment, still feeling unbalanced. Shinsou does his best to ignore him. He doesn\u2019t seem as agitated as he had yesterday (if yesterday had even happened).</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Izuku begins. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou opens the jar of protein powder Kacchan left in the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. And what did we do last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat nightmare really fucked you up, huh?\u201d Shinsou says, though there\u2019s no real malice in his words. \u201cAizawa took us to the mall to get some new equipment. I think you got some ankle weights, I got some braces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. He remembers that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then we ran into ...\u201d Shinsou stops. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re messed up? Because of the body we found last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>It had been the first dead body Izuku had seen up-close. It should have unnerved him more, but the woman looked like she was sleeping.</p>\n<p>But maybe the image had gotten stuck somewhere in his subconscious and created a vivid nightmare. Some kind of lucid dream. That must be it.</p>\n<p>Aizawa enters the dorm without saying good morning. He makes a beeline for Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku says, pulling on a smile. \u201cI had a nightmare, that\u2019s all. Shinsou and I were talking and I think maybe what we saw last night ...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cEven pro heroes find crime scenes confronting, especially if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen a body like that. Do you want to come with us until All Might arrives?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou doesn\u2019t argue, even though he had been so against Izuku joining them\u2014in his dream. That fake Saturday was just a dream.</p>\n<p>Izuku decides not to tell Aizawa that All Might isn\u2019t coming today. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I think I\u2019m just going to take a walk. Get some air.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa nods. Shinsou grabs his smoothie and dumps the blender in the sink, and they head out to the gym. Izuku resists the urge to call after them, to stop them from walking back to that same gym, to that unstable building.</p>\n<p>He waits a few minutes, before grabbing his wallet and phone and pulling his sneakers on. If there\u2019s no reception at UA, then he\u2019s going to have to go off campus to get some. He won\u2019t go far or stay out long. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>He jogs out of the dorm. The closer he gets to the gate, the harder his heart thuds against his ribs, and he starts running full-tilt. He\u2019ll head straight for a payphone. He remembers seeing some at the train station.</p>\n<p>Just before Izuku runs onto the footpath, he slams into a wall of glass. He\u2019s thrown backward, nose spraying blood.</p>\n<p>Izuku presses a hand to his bleeding noise, staring at the empty space in front of him. What was that?</p>\n<p>He springs back up and runs at the gate. Again, he hits an invisible wall.</p>\n<p>Izuku lays in the dirt, blood dripping onto his sweatshirt. There\u2019s nothing visible stopping him. Just open air. But when he stands and holds his hands out, he can feel static-warmth pulsing above a solid surface, like the electric fuzz coating an old TV that\u2019s just been turned off.</p>\n<p>He can still see people passing in front of UA, pedestrians and cars completely oblivious to Izuku shaking behind the gate.</p>\n<p>He bangs his fists against the glass barrier. \u201cHey! HEY.\u201d No one stops. No one glances at him. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t even exist. \u201cI\u2019m here. WE\u2019RE IN HERE!\u201d</p>\n<p>He keeps shouting until his throat hurts, but no one pays him any attention.</p>\n<p>Two strange incidents could have been written off. Phones not working is a problem with the network. Strange, gruesome memories are just nightmares. But this?</p>\n<p>This puts the pieces together. This tells him that it hadn\u2019t been a dream. That his phone should work. That they\u2019re in real danger.</p>\n<p>He runs his hands over the barrier, trying to feel for holes, but it\u2019s solid. It feels alive, humming under his palm.</p>\n<p>Izuku backs up and then crouches in the dirt, One for All pulsing through his legs. Then he runs at the gate and leaps into the air, up and up and up, until he\u2019s maybe thirty metres above the ground, well above the archway.</p>\n<p>He still slams into an invisible barrier.</p>\n<p>He plummets to the ground. He only just manages to twist around and land strategically, but his ankle still twinges painfully. It might be strained. Or maybe it\u2019s a fracture. Recovery Girl had once called his pain threshold dangerously high; he stopped being able to tell how severe his injuries are months ago.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t feel good, though. A faint throb, easy to ignore beneath the panic-adrenaline choking him. But still there. Real.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a dream. This is happening.</p>\n<p>Which means Aizawa and Shinsou are in danger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stops by the dorms to change into a clean shirt and wash his face, before heading back out to find Aizawa and Shinsou. His face is smudged pink, but it won\u2019t start bruising for another hour or so.</p>\n<p>And he has experience running on injuries. It hurts, but Izuku has perfected the art of walking without a limp, even if his ankle throbs with each step.</p>\n<p>He makes a beeline for the gym Aizawa and Shinsou had died in, but they\u2019re not there. He reaches for his phone instinctively. Then pauses. His phone isn\u2019t working. But then, he had called Aizawa this morning, hadn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>Why is Aizawa the only person he can reach?</p>\n<p>He hits call. Aizawa picks up after thirty terrifying seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining with Shinsou. Has something happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>What can he say? <em>I watched you die. There\u2019s a glass wall encasing campus, and it feels like a warm and breathing thing beneath my fingers, and I\u2019ve lived through this day twice now, and I can still feel the phantom stickiness of Shinsou\u2019s blood on my fingers\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa says, sharper this time, \u201care you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t say any of that. It sounds insane and he has no proof. And something in his gut, something that\u2019s years-old and carried him through a decade of schooling, reminds him that teachers don\u2019t believe his wild accusations. Or even his regular accusations, backed up with fist-sized burns and stolen shoes and desks graffitied with black marker.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust Aizawa. He does. He watched him bleed out under a Nomu, trying to protect their class, but he also knows that there\u2019s no point in telling him. Teachers don\u2019t want the help of their students. They want them to sit out during fights, even though Izuku has already seen, up-close, what can happen to someone if he\u2019s too far away to catch them.</p>\n<p>That woman in the alleyway might have been the first body he saw, but Shinsou and Aizawa were the second and third.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cReally. Where are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa tells him which gym they\u2019re in. Izuku thanks him and hangs up, already jogging across campus. His injured foot burns with every step, but that\u2019s okay. Izuku has gotten very good at pushing through the pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be with All Might today,\u201d Aizawa says. Shinsou is hovering further back, by the mats. He\u2019s wearing sweats, hands wrapped and hair pulled back with a cat-patterned headband. He watches Izuku warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI just\u2014I was worried you were going to use one of the training grounds? I was training there the other day and it was really unstable. I don\u2019t think you should use any of the gyms until they can be checked over. For safety reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa narrows his eyes. \u201cWhy are you only just bringing this to my attention now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to tell All Might,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cbut he just texted to say he\u2019s busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa looks him over. Izuku tries not to fidget. He feels that strange dichotomy of too big and too small again, like he\u2019s taking up too much room and will be scolded for it. It\u2019s a familiar feeling, especially when he\u2019s talking to teachers.</p>\n<p>Finally, Aizawa says, \u201cFine. Shinsou, take a break. I have a few calls to make.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think cell reception is down,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou called me earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, a quick bob of his head. \u201cI know, but every time I try and call someone off-campus it doesn\u2019t go through.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa rummages through his pocket and pulls out his phone. He tries to make two calls before giving up. \u201cI\u2019m going to check the main building\u2019s reception. Shinsou, Midoriya, don\u2019t train without me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa stalks out of the building. Izuku watches him go, holding onto his phone so hard it almost cracks. He can call Aizawa if something happens, but would Aizawa call him? If something happened\u2014if Izuku couldn\u2019t get to him quickly enough\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d Shinsou demands.</p>\n<p>Izuku turns. Blinks. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were just rattled by a nightmare this morning,\u201d Shinsou says, \u201cbut now you\u2019re barging into my training session and lying about accidents to distract Aizawa? I\u2019m sorry All Might had to bail, but he\u2019ll make time for you soon enough. He always does.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs nervously. \u201cWhat are you talking? All Might isn\u2019t\u2014we\u2019re just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou rolls his eyes. \u201cEveryone knows he\u2019s training you personally. Why wouldn\u2019t he, when your quirk is just like his? Why would he give anyone else the time of day if they don\u2019t have your power?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to stutter something out, some excuse, but Shinsou forges on, \u201cBut because he bailed on you, you had to go and ruin it for me too? You couldn\u2019t even let me have <em>one</em> day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the gym,\u201d Izuku insists. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou laughs, a rough sound that makes Izuku duck his head and squeeze his eyes shut. \u201cYou might have the teachers wrapped around your finger, but I\u2019m not going to fall for your bullshit. And I\u2019m not going to stop trying to be a hero, no matter how many times you shove me down. Tell as many lies as you want. Tell the whole school how much of a villain I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head, an <em>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d</em> caught in his throat, but Shinsou just laughs again and it sounds raw, like it hurts coming up his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Shinsou says, \u201cdo what you want. I bet you always have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>not</em>,\u201d Izuku says, starting to feel angry instead of just <em>small</em>. \u201cYou really would\u2019ve been in danger if I hadn\u2019t done something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, hero,\u201d Shinsou says sarcastically, shoving past him and heading to the door. Izuku scrambles after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou, wait!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou whirls on him. \u201cThe sick thing is, you don\u2019t even realise how privileged you are\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>With a <em>crack</em> the ventilation fan above them breaks. Heavy metal pieces are dislodged from the ceiling and rain down around them.</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to grab Shinsou, but a sharp piece of metal lands between them, cutting Izuku off for a second.</p>\n<p>And a second is all it takes.</p>\n<p>The vent lands on Shinsou doesn\u2019t kill him outright. The collapsing building hadn\u2019t killed him immediately last time, either.</p>\n<p>Shinsou looks up at him blearily. He\u2019s bleeding out onto the linoleum floors, and Izuku can\u2019t help but stare at the flesh upturned by the sharp metal, the hint of bone and something meatier\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shinsou rasps, or tries to. It doesn\u2019t come out quite right.</p>\n<p>Izuku is frozen. He never freezes, but standing there, watching Shinsou bleed out for the second time, it feels like every joint in his body has locked up.</p>\n<p>Aizawa rounds the corner at a sprint and then stops. \u201cI heard\u2014<em>Shinsou</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou goes quickly, after that. Aizawa tries to save him with Izuku shakily following all of his instructions, but it doesn\u2019t work. They still have to watch him die.</p>\n<p>Aizawa and Izuku sit there, on their knees, blood staining their fronts. Aizawa is breathing hard. Izuku has never heard him sound like this, so shaky and untethered. Not when he was pinned beneath the Nomu\u2019s hands. Not when Bakugou was kidnapped or Nighteye died. He had managed to sound strong then.</p>\n<p>Now, Aizawa sounds lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei,\u201d Izuku says, feeling useless, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa closes his eyes. \u201cStop. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>But it is. He had seen something like this happen once before and he let it happen again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve pushed him out of the way,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cIf I had just been faster\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said stop. If anything, it\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have left you both here after you told me that there was something wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know! You d-didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d And now Aizawa is blaming himself, even though Izuku is the one that failed to save Shinsou. For the second time. He\u2019s supposed to be a hero, and now he\u2019s failed to save the same person twice.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cIzuku. I need you to breath for me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine. Shinsou is the one who\u2014who\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His vision is blurring around the edges. This is what it had felt like last night\u2014the greying in his vision and rocking beneath his feet before he passed out. Maybe this means that all hope isn\u2019t lost.</p>\n<p>Maybe it means another chance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d Izuku says, latching onto the front of Aizawa\u2019s jumpsuit. \u201cI\u2019ll save you both next time. I promise, sensei.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to calm down,\u201d Aizawa says, hands clamped around Izuku\u2019s wrists, like he\u2019s trying to hold Izuku together. \u201cBreathe. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re alright. Just breathe with me, okay? In and ...\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s voice peters out. Everything goes watery and grey and then a cold, beautiful black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku jerks upright.</p>\n<p>He grabs his phone. Saturday, 7:44am, it says. (1) new message.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s back again.</p>\n<p>He jumps out of bed. His foot doesn\u2019t twinge with pain and his ankle isn\u2019t swelling beneath his sweatpants, even though he remembers hurting it after he bounced off the invisible wall trapping him inside UA.</p>\n<p>He sprints downstairs. Shinsou is in the kitchen, rummaging through the fridge. When he looks up and sees Izuku in the living room, sweaty and panting like he\u2019s just run a marathon, he shuts the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hugs him so hard that his legs leave the ground. Shinsou goes stiff and starts swearing, wriggling in Izuku\u2019s hold, but he just tightens his hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Izuku says, almost dizzy with relief.</p>\n<p>Shinsou rams his bony shoulder into Izuku\u2019s cheek, forcing Izuku to drop him. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Twice now, he\u2019s had to watch Shinsou die, only to wake up to All Might\u2019s message, as if the day had never happened.</p>\n<p>This is a pattern, now. Which means it\u2019s probably going to happen again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t train today,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Shinsou drops Kacchan\u2019s protein powder, scowling. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Izuku\u2019s heart is beating in his throat. This is how he feels whenever the League of Villains attacks; like every second is hurdling past him, danger pressing down on the people he\u2019s supposed to protect. \u201cYou need to stay inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou shoves past him, grabbing his bag as he goes, abandoning the half-made smoothie on the countertop. \u201cI know it might be hard for someone like you to understand, but I\u2019m not made of glass just because I don\u2019t have an offensive quirk. Not all heroes need to be able to punch buildings into dust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou whirls on him. \u201cOh, yeah? What did you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku fumbles for an explanation. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with the gyms\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His body stiffens, his mouth clamps shut. Shinsou drops his bag. \u201cStay there,\u201d he orders, and Izuku has no choice but to stay rooted in place.</p>\n<p>Shinsou is packing away the smoothie ingredients when Aizawa enters the dorms. He spots Izuku frozen in place and activates his quirk, eyes flashing red. Izuku can finally move again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Aizawa demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya is trying to stop me from training,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cApparently it\u2019s too <em>dangerous</em> for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa turns to Izuku for his version of events. He just opens and closes his mouth, still reeling from what happened yesterday afternoon. If that aborted Saturday even counts as yesterday.</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m sorry,</em> he wants to say.<em> I\u2019m so, so sorry.</em></p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t remember that Izuku was too slow and got Shinsou killed. But Izuku remembers.</p>\n<p>But Aizawa must see the guilt in his expression. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you to try and impede another student\u2019s progress. Do you have a problem with Shinsou?\u201d Izuku shakes his head mutely. \u201cIf you do, you take it to me. Or better yet, keep it to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Shinsou and Aizawa leave to train. The dorms sound so empty without them. It reminds him of the woods during their training camp. The black clearings ringed with trees, so disarmingly quiet for a forest full of villains. The near-silent walk after they had met up with Kacchan, only to look back and find him gone, snatched from under their noses.</p>\n<p>Izuku has to fix this.</p>\n<p>He tries the UA gate again. The invisible wall is still there. He scouts the perimeter of the school using One for All, but finds no trace of villains. And finally, in a fit of panic, he breaks into the main building and finds Principal Nezu\u2019s office. The main phone there doesn\u2019t work. Neither does the computer. Izuku is rifling through Nezu\u2019s desk, feeling like a thief, when an explosion shakes the whole building.</p>\n<p>He drops the file and whirls around. Through the floor-to-ceiling window, he can see plumes of smoke rising from one of the training facilities.</p>\n<p>No. No, not again.</p>\n<p>Izuku runs towards the billowing smoke, lungs burning. The gym is an inferno. The roof has collapsed inward.</p>\n<p>He pulls out his phone and rings Aizawa without looking away from the flames.</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>He tries again, and again, and wants to start crying when he realises that he doesn\u2019t have Shinsou\u2019s number. He knows it won\u2019t work, but he cycles through other numbers again. All Might. Mum. Iida. Todoroki. Uraraka. Mirio.</p>\n<p>No one picks up.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no sirens howling in the distance. No firetruck stationed outside of UA gates, called by the fire blazing inside. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve been fully cut off from the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Izuku sits down. He\u2019s getting too dizzy to stay upright. The smoke stings his eyes and itches his lungs, but he doesn\u2019t have the strength to move away from the blaze.</p>\n<p>When his vision begins to grow dark, Izuku is ready for it. He lays down and closes his eyes, welcoming it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku sits up. It\u2019s Saturday morning again.</p>\n<p>On autopilot, he tries to call someone off-campus. He doesn\u2019t feel disappointed when the phone rings out. Just tired.</p>\n<p>Is there any point in going downstairs today? Maybe if he stays away from Aizawa and Shinsou, nothing will hurt them. Maybe Izuku is the trigger.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a weak theory, but it means he won\u2019t have to leave his bed. Izuku pulls out his notebook, settles against his headboard, and goes over the facts.</p>\n<p>This is the fourth Saturday he remembers. So far, Aizawa has died twice and Shinsou has died three times. He\u2019s not sure exactly what happened that third time, but there had been no evidence that the explosion had been caused by a villain attack. If anything, it had looked like an accident.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d all looked like accidents. Like completely random tragedies.</p>\n<p>Except they\u2019re not. Izuku could believe one incident occurring, but three? Almost impossible. Something or someone is triggering these events. But how?</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the fact that it seems like Izuku is time travelling. And the fact that he can\u2019t contact anyone outside of UA.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is a dream or a hallucination. It feels too real, but then, his nightmares always feel do, right up until he wakes up, sweaty and nauseous with the phantom feel of blood on his hands.</p>\n<p>But even if this <em>might</em> be a dream\u2014and Izuku doubts that it is\u2014he can\u2019t risk treating it like one. Because if there\u2019s even the slightest chance that this is real, and he does nothing and Shinsou and Aizawa die permanently, then Izuku couldn\u2019t live with himself.</p>\n<p>Izuku flips to a fresh page. He doesn\u2019t know how to fix this, but he has to come up with something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone rings mid-afternoon, jerking him out of his stupor. He thinks, for a moment, that it\u2019s All Might ringing to say he\u2019s finally finished with the Hero Conference and he\u2019s on his way back to campus. But then he checks the caller ID. It\u2019s Aizawa.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not Aizawa that he hears when he answers the call. It\u2019s Shinsou. He\u2019s crying on the other side of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou,\u201d Izuku says calmly, \u201cyou need to take a deep breath for me. Can you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou sucks in a rattling inhale. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s Aizawa. He\u2019s \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku closes his eyes. He needs to get up and find Shinsou. He knows, firsthand, how awful it is to see someone you admire die. He knows how trapped you can feel, alone with a corpse and knowing no help is coming.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s already seen Aizawa die before. It\u2019s hard to convince his body to move when it still remembers the image of Aizawa half-buried in rubble, bleeding from his open eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were training and then he went white and started having chest pains,\u201d Shinsou chokes out. \u201cAnd he just\u2014he just <em>collapsed</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>A heart attack. That\u2019s new. Does that rule out the possibility that this is a reality-manipulating quirk? But then again, it\u2019s possible that someone with a similar quirk, like luck-alteration, could mess with Aizawa\u2019s cardiovascular system. It wouldn\u2019t be too hard to skew the odds like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>mumbling</em> right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku cuts himself off, forcing himself to focus on the ragged breathing on the other side of the line and not on his half-formed notes. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m listening. Really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t contact anyone,\u201d Shinsou says, and now he sounds more angry than panicked. Izuku understands that. He does. Since he\u2019s been trapped in this time loop, he\u2019s punched holes in a few walls. \u201cNot the police, not Recovery Girl, not Present Mic. Only you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReception must be down on campus,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cMy phone isn\u2019t working either. Tell me where you are and I\u2019ll meet you there, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as gruesome as that first time, but it\u2019s still hard to see Aizawa splayed out on the ground, pale and unmoving. He tries to guide Shinsou out of the gym, away from the body, but Shinsou keeps fighting him. He won\u2019t let Izuku separate him from Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou,\u201d Izuku says, both hands on Shinsou\u2019s shoulders, trying to keep his attention on him instead of Aizawa. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou shakes his head, breathing quickly and shallowly. \u201cIt\u2019s not. You can\u2019t just fucking say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Izuku says, and Shinsou just laughs. \u201cOkay, he is dead, but I mean he\u2019s not going to stay dead. He\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou laughs again, the sound hiccuping in the middle. \u201cAnd <em>I</em> thought I wasn\u2019t handling this well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands bunch in Shinsou\u2019s uniform. He\u2019s never told anyone about the loops before, not really, but he can\u2019t let Shinsou fall apart, thinking this reality is the one they\u2019re stuck with when Izuku knows it\u2019s not. \u201cListen to me: this has happened before. It\u2019s some kind of\u2014of time loop. You two keep dying, and I keep waking up again on Saturday morning to find you both alive. The day will restart soon and Aizawa will be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Black is already encroaching on the edges of his vision. He\u2019s kneeling on the gym floor, trying to keep Shinsou together, but the earth still feels unsteady beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to figure out how to fix this,\u201d Izuku promises, mustering up a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m going to make it okay.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Shinsou doesn\u2019t believe him. Izuku can see the struggle play out on his face; he clearly wants to believe him, but Aizawa is lying dead a few metres away and he\u2019s deep in shock and he doesn\u2019t even like Izuku, let alone trust him.</p>\n<p><em>But that\u2019s okay,</em> Izuku thinks, holding onto Shinsou\u2019s uniform as they both shudder, shivering on the linoleum floor. <em>He doesn\u2019t have to believe that I\u2019ll save him; I just have to make it happen.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wakes up with fresh determination and All Might\u2019s voice blaring from his phone.</p>\n<p>He picks up his notebook. All of his theories and ideas are gone, but Izuku remembers them. He can try them all, one by one.</p>\n<p>It seems like he has all the time in the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t sure how many Saturdays it\u2019s been. He could probably work it out in his head if he stopped and counted all the ways Aizawa and/or Shinsou have died, but he doesn\u2019t want to. What would be the point?</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the point?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a familiar thought, one that greeted him when he was nine and still sore from running into Kacchan the day before; when he was fifteen and his bones were aching from overusing One for All; when he was sixteen and the only thing on the news was All Might\u2019s abrupt retirement and the rising death toll in Kamino Ward.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of the reasons why he has All Might\u2019s face wallpapered around his room. When he wakes up and feels like his bones are full of cement, he can look up and see All Might beaming down at him. Telling him that it\u2019s okay. Reminding him of his goal.</p>\n<p>But All Might\u2019s voice is echoing in his ears, and he can see Aizawa\u2019s body behind his lids, bloody and twisted up and not moving, and Izuku is so tired.</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s looking at this from the wrong angle. Maybe he\u2019s not supposed to save them; after all, every time he shepards them to a new location or prevents one misfortune, another violent accident will crop up when he\u2019s not looking. Like the universe is rewriting itself, just to kill Aizawa or Shinsou or both of them at once.</p>\n<p>He props himself up against the headboard and stares down at his phone\u2019s wallpaper, the way he stared at his All Might posters when he was young and bruised and trying to find the motivation to get up and put his uniform on.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a selfie, slightly blurry. All Might had gotten permission to sneak them off campus to get boba since it was Tsuyu\u2019s birthday. In the photo, they\u2019re crammed together in front of the store. All Might, and his friends, and Izuku.</p>\n<p><em>Keep going,</em> their smiles tell them.<em> It\u2019s worth it.</em></p>\n<p>When Izuku forces himself out of bed, he searches campus from top to bottom, looking for\u2014something. Anything. A sign of villain activity, or forced entry, or a way to get out of UA.</p>\n<p>He finds nothing.</p>\n<p>His phone rings mid-afternoon and Izuku sits down in the dirt, his arm throbbing from another failed attempt to jump over the wall. It\u2019s cool in the shade. He lets his phone ring out.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s Shinsou or Aizawa, but he knows what they will say. He doesn\u2019t want to hear one of them tell him about the other\u2019s death. Not again. So he sits in the dirt and thinks about that afternoon with his friends. The feel of All Might and Todoroki pressing in on either side of him. The sight of Uraraka, Tsuyu and Iida laughing on the other side of the boothe. The taste of mint tea.</p>\n<p>When his vision gets blurry, he lays down. Roots dig into his back and there are leaves in his hair, but flat on the ground, he can almost pretend he\u2019s going to sleep instead of passing out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, Izuku thinks, <em>Maybe I\u2019m going about this the wrong way.</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s thought this. It\u2019s a theory that\u2019s been growing in the back of his head like a fungus.</p>\n<p>Because if he can\u2019t stop Aizawa and Shinsou from getting killed and there\u2019s nothing tangible for him to fight; if he can\u2019t find whatever or whoever is doing this and make them stop; if he can\u2019t leave campus or contact someone and get help, then what else is there?</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t get through the day without at least one of them dying. So far, Izuku has been running on the assumption that all three of them need to survive long enough for the day to tick over to Sunday, but maybe that\u2019s not it at all.</p>\n<p>The time loops are triggered by a death. Maybe the same kind of logic needs to be applied to break them <em>out</em> of the loops.</p>\n<p>Maybe someone needs to voluntarily die. Maybe that person is him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been almost two weeks of repeated Saturdays, and Shinsou and Aizawa have died a dozen times each, often together but sometimes apart.</p>\n<p>But Izuku has never been the target of any accidents. He hasn\u2019t died once, even when he\u2019s standing near Shinsou or Aizawa when they\u2019re killed. Izuku is the only one with his memories intact, too. That means something.</p>\n<p>Maybe the loops have been leading him to this conclusion the entire time.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not a theory he can just test, is it? If he\u2019s incorrect, he might not get brought back like Aizawa and Shinsou. But then, maybe Shinsou and Aizawa would still make it to Sunday alive \u2026 Even if Izuku died permanently, he would have at least saved them.</p>\n<p>Izuku pushes the thought away and goes downstairs to try, once again, to keep Shinsou and Aizawa out of the gyms.</p>\n<p>But the idea lingers, growing roots in the back of his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t know what number he\u2019s on. He was counting Saturdays, but he\u2019s lost track. More than ten. Less than twenty. Or was it higher than twenty?</p>\n<p>His head feels too heavy, but he\u2019s never stayed in bed for an entire loop, even if he wanted to. He can\u2019t just lay there while Shinsou and Aizawa are in danger.</p>\n<p>He pushes himself out of bed and stumbles downstairs, collapsing onto the couch.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realise Shinsou has abandoned his smoothie, until he cracks open his eyes to find Shinsou leaning over the back of the couch, staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Shinsou asks.</p>\n<p>Izuku shrugs into the couch. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou doesn\u2019t ask what\u2019s wrong. Izuku doesn\u2019t expect him to. Shinsou is stubbornly against becoming his friend, despite Izuku\u2019s attempts at changing that.</p>\n<p>Izuku sits up, watching Shinsou return to the kitchen to finish making a smoothie. \u201cHey,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou startles, almost knocking over the container of protein powder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Izuku goes on. \u201cI\u2019m not very likeable. I talk too much and mumble and get fixated and my social skills are, uh, pretty bad. And I\u2019m not funny or\u2014\u201d He shakes his head, scrubbing a hand through his frazzled hair. \u201cI just mean that I understand. But I need to know: is there a reason why you\u2019re so against me? Did I do something to offend you?\u201d</p>\n<p>If, a year ago, he had asked this same question to a student from his grade, he would know the answer: he was quirkless, and weird, and too-skinny, and unattractive, and it was social suicide to talk to him. He\u2019d heard it enough growing up.</p>\n<p>But he isn\u2019t that Deku anymore. He\u2019s a UA student with friends. He won Todoroki over through sheer force of will. Some people didn\u2019t like him on principle, like Kacchan and Sir Nighteye. And maybe Aizawa too, he isn\u2019t sure about that one.</p>\n<p>But he hasn\u2019t done anything to Shinsou, aside from fight him at the sports festival, but that was something students were required to do.</p>\n<p>There were no ugly rumours circulating the school or insults scrawled on his desk in permanent marker, a warning to everyone in the school to stay away from Izuku. So why was Shinsou immediately so hostile towards him?</p>\n<p>Shinsou stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku echoes.</p>\n<p>Shinsou stays quiet, just looking at him. Izuku doesn\u2019t have the energy to think about what the expression on Shinsou\u2019s face might mean.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d Shinsou finally says. He rounds the couch and sits down on the other end, just out of reach of Izuku\u2019s sneakers. \u201cI don\u2019t get you, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs quietly. \u201cYeah, me neither. I keep trying to make friends with you, but you\u2019re always so ...\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Hostile</em>, Izuku almost says, but that\u2019s not it. <em>Defensive</em> seems like it fits here.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never thought you were genuine,\u201d Shinsou says slowly, like he\u2019s still not sure if Izuku is telling the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re so\u2014\u201d He waves a hand over Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just gestured to all of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re All Might\u2019s favourite,\u201d Shinsou goes on. \u201cYou have an insane quirk, and All Might loves you, and the rest of Class 1-A look up to you. I shouldn\u2019t even be on your radar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sits up. \u201cWhy would you say that? You think\u2014what, that I\u2019d look down on you because I\u2019m a hero student?\u201d</p>\n<p>He remembers other school\u2019s assumptions about UA students. The way some of the kids from the General Education sneer at them, because they expect the Hero Course to be sneering right back.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my experience,\u201d Shinsou says, something far-away in his eyes, \u201ckids with quirks like yours don\u2019t get along with people like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to picture it from Shinsou\u2019s perspective. He imagines what it would be like to meet Class 1-A as an outsider. If he had never met All Might, his classmates wouldn\u2019t have been his friends. He knows, firsthand, that they\u2019re all amazing and kind people\u2014but in another life, Izuku wouldn\u2019t know that. Class 1-A would be, first and foremost, <em>Kacchan\u2019s</em> friends. Kids blessed with powerful quirks, on their way to becoming successful heroes, while Izuku was left behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it like that,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cCan we start over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods, though he still looks reluctant. Cautious. Like he\u2019s waiting for a blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Midoriya Izuku,\u201d he says, holding out his hand. \u201cI look forward to working with you. Let\u2019s be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou snorts. He takes Izuku\u2019s hand and shakes it up and down. \u201cShinsou Hitoshi. And we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa arrives, then. He doesn\u2019t react when he sees Shinsou and Izuku sitting side-by-side on the couch, shaking hands and laughing at nothing.</p>\n<p>Shinsou pulls his hands back, but he doesn\u2019t jump away from the couch, so Izuku counts it a win. \u201cSensei. Good morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Aizawa says, before turning his attention to Izuku and his wild bedhead. \u201cWhere\u2019s All Might?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy at the hero conference,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cPrincipal Nezu needed him for an extra day, so he won\u2019t be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou stands. He looks hesitantly from Izuku to Aizawa. \u201cMaybe Midoriya could train with us today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Aizawa says, as though this isn\u2019t a big deal, as though he hasn\u2019t always said no when Izuku asked to train with them.</p>\n<p>But this is the first time Shinsou has extended the invitation. Normally, Izuku is the one trying to intrude on their private training session.</p>\n<p>Aizawa turns to grab Shinsou\u2019s bag for him, and Shinsou shoots him a secret smile. Izuku smiles wobbly back.</p>\n<p>After so many days alone, this means more to Izuku than he can say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun is beginning to set, casting the school in an orange glow. Izuku hasn\u2019t gotten this far into a Saturday before. Either Shinsou or Aizawa are always killed by late afternoon.</p>\n<p>He feels light. His body aches pleasantly from a successful work-out, and he\u2019s still buzzing from Aizawa\u2019s compliment about his improving hand-to-hand. He still remembers the small, secret smiles Shinsou had shot him that morning.</p>\n<p>Izuku wants to eat dinner and sleep off the post-work out exhaustion. He feels almost dazed with happiness\u2014or maybe it's relief. He\u2019s beginning to think that, maybe, they\u2019re in the clear. He can almost taste Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s why the ambush comes as such a surprise.</p>\n<p>One of the villains has a paralysing quirk. Izuku\u2019s face is pressed into the hard floor, and he\u2019s unable to move or even twitch. He can only breathe. And watch.</p>\n<p>This is how Izuku felt when he was pinned in that alleyway, watching Stain approach Iida with his blades drawn. Except that quirk had eventually worn off. It\u2019s been almost twenty minutes and Izuku still can\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>They paralysed Aizawa too. He lays across from Izuku on his belly, dark eyes intense and mouth struggling to form words, opening and closing soundlessly like a fish.</p>\n<p>Shinsou is being held in place by four men. A muzzle keeps his mouth closed. Muffled whines and screams escape through his gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>In all the Saturdays Izuku has lived through, this is the first time that they\u2019ve been attacked by villains. This is the first time any of them have been tortured.</p>\n<p>Izuku wishes it were him they were cutting into. Not Shinsou.</p>\n<p>He thought, at first, that this was the group trapping them in a time loop, but that doesn\u2019t add up. The things this group is saying\u2014it doesn\u2019t make sense. This sounds like a one-off attack. Opportunistic and quick. Not like they\u2019ve been watching them suffer for three weeks worth of Saturdays.</p>\n<p>One of the villains wrenches Shinsou\u2019s shoulder out of his socket and he screams and bucks under their hands, eyes wide and frantic.</p>\n<p>Izuku wonders if this is some kind of sign. It must be. Why else would they\u2014whoever is orchestrating this, whoever is designing new ways to kill Aizawa and Shinsou only to revive them\u2014make them live through this?</p>\n<p>Shinsou finally stops struggling against the hands holding him. He slumps to the ground, blood dripping from the shallow cuts that pepper his body. His eyes meet Izuku\u2019s.</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m sorry,</em> Izuku wants to say. <em>I let my guard down. I\u2019m so, so sorry.</em></p>\n<p>The leader crouches by Shinsou. He buries his hand in Shinsou\u2019s hair, yanking his head up at a painful angle. Shinsou just glares weakly at him. \u201cGiving up, then? Fine. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves a lazy hand at Aizawa. \u201cKill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>That gets a reaction from Shinsou. He starts thrashing again, almost dislocating his good shoulder, shrieking behind his muzzle.</p>\n<p>Izuku closes his eyes. At least now the day will restart.</p>\n<p>But it won\u2019t be over. Not really. This could happen again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. An endless string of Saturdays with no way out.</p>\n<p>Aizawa dies with a faint gurgle and a spray of blood, still mouthing soundlessly at them. Shinsou sounds inhuman behind the muzzle.</p>\n<p>The leader eyes Izuku. \u201cHuh. This one barely even blinked. I wonder \u2026 kill the Gen Ed kid. I want to see what happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>They kill Shinsou slower than they had killed Aizawa. Izuku still can\u2019t move or speak or twitch. He just lies there, crying freely, as Shinsou chokes and screeches and stares at Izuku with such panic, his eyes screaming out for help that Izuku can\u2019t give, until they finally get bored and slit Shinsou\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wakes with a scream caught behind his teeth and All Might\u2019s voice in his ears.</p>\n<p>\n<em>A message is here! A message is here!</em>\n</p>\n<p>He grabs the phone and hurls it across his room with a burst of One for All. It shatters, leaving a sizeable dent in the wall. Who cares? In another twelve hours, he\u2019ll be waking up to an intact phone and the dent will be gone.</p>\n<p>He tears off the blankets. He\u2019s sweaty and panting, but there\u2019s no fresh bruises from the ambush, no blood drenching his sweatshirt.</p>\n<p>He should be used to this. He\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>He pulls his sweatshirt off so roughly that the sleeves tear and then he climbs into the shower with his socks still on. The water is scalding. He doesn\u2019t even feel it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been so stupid. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d fixed everything just because\u2014what? He started getting along with Shinsou?</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not how this works. He was reaching the third week of repeated Saturdays and so when something had changed, when the day had seemed to go right in a way it never had before, he had let himself hope. Let his guard down. Forget how much danger Shinsou and Aizawa are in.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let them go through that again. Even if they don\u2019t retain their memories of their deaths, they still experienced it.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let either of them die again at all. This needs to end. Today.</p>\n<p>His brain drifts back to his old theories. To the biggest one, lodged in his throat. The one his mind keeps coming back to. He\u2019s tried everything else, hasn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>There are four outcomes to this theory:</p>\n<p>1) He\u2019s wrong and he wakes up Saturday morning like he has almost twenty times before, one more theory tested and crossed off the list.</p>\n<p>2) He\u2019s right and he wakes up Sunday morning with Shinsou and Aizawa alive and safe.</p>\n<p>3) He\u2019s right, but Shinsou and Aizawa make it to Sunday without him.</p>\n<p>4) He\u2019s right and Sunday arrives but all three of them are dead.</p>\n<p>That final outcome scares him, but it\u2019s the only plan he has left. And three of four aren\u2019t bad odds.</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks water out of his eyes. His skin is bruised pink and steam billows up around him. The too-hot water is making him feel lightheaded. He turns the water off, and just lays at the bottom of the shower until his head stops spinning and he feels like he can breathe again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has thought about this before. He never seriously considered it, even when Kacchan told him to take a swan-dive off the roof, even when anonymous notes in his locker and black graffiti on his desk told him to go kill himself.</p>\n<p>But he has thought about it. Idly, almost clinically, the same way he maps out hero fights.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d decided a long time ago that overdosing would be the best option. He doesn\u2019t care about pain, but he does care about the mess. He could ride the train somewhere deserted, where no one would recognise him, where his mum wouldn\u2019t find him, and quietly overdose somewhere abandoned. Most other methods had too many variables or would traumatised whoever found his body.</p>\n<p>But the only strong medication on campus that he knows about is in Recovery Girl\u2019s office, and if he takes those and isn\u2019t revived, then he doesn\u2019t want that on her conscience. And what if she faced legal repercussions because of him?</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll have to jump. Kacchan is always right, it seems. Even about this.</p>\n<p>He dresses in the first clothes he grabs and shoves some notepaper and a pen in his pocket, and makes his way to the main building. It\u2019s locked, but Izuku has broken into the building a dozen times before. The alarm is either disengaged or silent. It\u2019s supposed to send an alert to Principal Nezu, surrounding hero agencies and emergency services, but no one has ever shown up.</p>\n<p>He climbs the stairs all the way to the top of the building, and then sits down by the edge to write a quick note. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to blame themselves for this.</p>\n<p>He takes off his red shoes and socks and lines them up neatly by the edge. The note is folded up and placed inside his right shoe so it doesn\u2019t blow away or get soaked in blood.</p>\n<p>He steps onto the ledge. Takes a deep, grounding breath. And then a scarf wraps around his waist and jerks him back.</p>\n<p>He collides with a hard body. He spins around, the scarf still around his waist, and finds Aizawa bearing down at him. He\u2019s breathing hard, and his hands are digging into Izuku\u2019s arms with bruising force, and he looks <em>scared</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares at him, dry-mouthed and numb. He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s shaking or if Aizawa is or if the ground is titling beneath them.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing? I found you up on the ledge and that\u2019s <em>nothing?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says, shrinking in Aizawa\u2019s hold. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would\u2014you\u2019re supposed to be training with Shinsou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been \u2026 and if you had \u2026\u201d Aizawa seems, for the first time, at a loss for words.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sensei.\u201d Izuku tries to sound soothing, but the words come out mangled. Aizawa doesn\u2019t have any memory of the past few weeks, unlike Izuku, so every day, it hits him fresh. Every death, Aizawa experiences for the first time without any context. He doesn\u2019t have any explanation for this, either. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. This isn\u2019t what it looks like, it\u2019s just the only way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa loosens his grip. Not enough for Izuku to squirm out of his hold and dash back towards the ledge, but enough that his grip doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the dorms. I\u2019ll call your mum and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, because he\u2019s already tried that a hundred times before, and then his next breath is caught on a hiccup, and then he\u2019s crying.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point. There\u2019s no other way to get to Sunday\u2014\u201d He claps a hand over his mouth to muffle a sob. Through his fingers, he manages, \u201cI can\u2019t watch you and Shinsou die again, sensei. Please don\u2019t make me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa crouches down in front of him, studying Izuku\u2019s face intently. He touches Izuku\u2019s forehead and checks his pupils and runs his hands over his scalp, looking for bumps. He finds nothing.</p>\n<p>Izuku has been checking himself over for any sign of tampering for weeks. But this is real. This is all so real.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not drugged,\u201d Izuku says, exhausted.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen explain,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head, no.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t fight when Aizawa gathers his shoes and herds them off the rooftop. Today is a write off. Maybe he can hide in his room so he won\u2019t have to watch how today will end. It\u2019s a selfish thought, but it makes him feel a little better.</p>\n<p>Aizawa holds on to him as the elevator descends, even though there\u2019s nowhere for him to go. The doors open. Shinsou is waiting for them on the other side, pale and tense. His wane face reminds Izuku of the first time Shinsou had to watch Aizawa die. He remembers crouching on the gym floor, clutching at Shinsou as they both shivered through the shock of it. Of promising Shinsou that he would save them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Shinsou asks, then shakes his head as if answering his own question. \u201cSorry. Nevermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa steers Izuku out of the elevator, towards the dorms. He feels like a balloon, bobbing aimlessly after its string.</p>\n<p>At the dorms, Aizawa pushes him onto the sofa. Shinsou fetches him a glass of water, and Izuku sips at it, staring down at his still-bare feet. He can feel the expectant weight of both of their stares.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean,\u201d Aizawa begins, softer than he normally is, \u201cwhen you said that killing yourself was the only way to get to Sunday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku closes his eyes. He had hoped Aizawa hadn\u2019t heard what he had said up on the roof. He sits there, the sweating glass pressed against his aching forehead, and thinks about what he could possibly say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you rather we talk in private?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku says, lowering his glass. \u201cShinsou can stay. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>They lapse back into silence. Izuku grasps blindly for an excuse to give them, but comes up blank.</p>\n<p>Well, he supposes. They won\u2019t remember this anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cJumping is the only way I can think to get to Sunday,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything else, but the day just keeps resetting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa twitches, as if he wants to reach over and check Izuku\u2019s pupils again. Izuku smiles, but he just feels tired and sore and his mind keeps flicking back to the rooftop.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a deep breath, lets it out, and then tells them about three weeks worth of Saturdays.</p>\n<p>He tells them about that first day, when he hadn\u2019t realised anything was wrong. He tells them about the second and third, when he realised just how terrible their situation was. He tells them about all his theories and ideas and how none of them had worked and every day still ended in a death.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s done, his voice is strained and his hands are shaking around the glass, threatening to spill water onto the couch cushions, so he puts it on the coffee table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I was up on that rooftop,\u201d Izuku says, eyes fixed on his lap, too afraid to look at Shinsou or Aizawa and see their expressions. \u201cAll this time, I\u2019ve never died. If the time loop is triggered by your death, then maybe my death is the way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening. You\u2019re not resorting to that. What else have we tried?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks muzzily up at him. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said we\u2019ve been through twenty Saturdays. Were those all of our ideas? We can\u2019t have exhausted every option.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried everything I could think of,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about just staying in one position all day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku grimaces. \u201cI tried staying in my room all day, away from you both, but Shinsou called me that afternoon to tell me that you\u2019d died. And I couldn\u2019t get you and Shinsou to stay in one spot all day. I couldn\u2019t think of a good enough reason to stop your training session, and every time I mentioned that there might be a villain attack, you went out to try and contact Nezu or sweep the grounds and ...\u201d</p>\n<p>Once, he\u2019d made up a story about a villain attack. Aizawa had shoved Izuku and Shinsou into the emergency bunker under the dorms and then gone out by himself. When he didn\u2019t come back, Izuku had gone looking for him\u2014and found him behind a copse of trees, bleeding out. Izuku still isn\u2019t sure what killed him.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares at him for a long moment. Izuku is too emotionally wrung out to decipher that strange, intense look on his teacher\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>And then Aizawa says, \u201cHow many times have you told me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times have you told me about the time loops? How many times have you lived through this day on your own?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou sucks in a sharp breath on the other side of the couch. Izuku just cocks his head, confused, and says, \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve found out.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence.</p>\n<p>Then Shinsou blurts, \u201cWhat the fuck, Midoriya?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku picks at the ragged skin around his thumbnail. When he peers up at Aizawa, he\u2019s incredibly still. Izuku can\u2019t read the expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei, are you okay?\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Izuku echoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well, I don\u2019t know, I just ...\u201d</p>\n<p>It had never really occurred to him to tell them. He couldn\u2019t waste time trying to convince them that he wasn\u2019t attention-seeking or going insane. And he needed to solve this, instead of just being relocated to the bunker while the adult took care of everything.</p>\n<p>In Izuku\u2019s experience, teachers rarely took his accusations seriously. And if they did, they still couldn\u2019t save him.</p>\n<p>The teachers at his primary and middle school couldn\u2019t save him from Kacchan or his classmates\u2014though there hadn\u2019t been many that would acknowledge that there was a problem in the first place. The UA staff weren\u2019t able to protect them, though they tried. The League of Villains was always too strong, too close, with help too far away.</p>\n<p>Izuku has always had to fight to protect himself and the people around him. Getting help has, until very recently, been a luxury.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would believe me,\u201d Izuku admits, still picking at his thumb. It\u2019s beginning to bleed. \u201cI had to save you, sensei. I couldn\u2019t waste time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t <em>waste time</em> letting a pro hero know that something was wrong?\u201d Shinsou\u2019s voice cracks, though he doesn\u2019t sound angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to hand the reins over to a pro hero. No offence, sensei, but your memory kept getting reset every day and I didn\u2019t want you to take over. It was my job to save you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa says, and now Izuku can interpret that expression on his teacher\u2019s face: it\u2019s pain. Aizawa is in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re sixteen. It\u2019s not your job to fix this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku grits his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a hero\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa holds up a hand to stop him. \u201cYou\u2019re a child. You\u2019re my student. And you thought it was a better idea to kill yourself rather than tell me what was going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku says, wiping his thumb on his sleeve to get rid of the pooling blood, \u201cwhen you say it like that, it sounds pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa shuts his eyes. He takes a moment to just breathe, and Izuku wishes he could stuff all the words back into his mouth. He glances at Shinsou. He looks upset too.</p>\n<p>They might not remember it, but Aizawa and Shinsou have been repeatedly hurt the past three weeks. They don\u2019t need Izuku burdening them like this.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll have to be better tomorrow. He\u2019ll make sure Aizawa and Shinsou are busy training, and then he\u2019ll head straight to the rooftop to take care of this.</p>\n<p>When Aizawa opens his eyes again, looking more composed, he turns to Izuku. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this again when the danger has passed, but for now: promise me you\u2019ll tell me if the day resets and I forget what you just told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku falters. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa says, sharp. \u201cIzuku. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll believe you,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cWe will. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku glances between them. Their expressions are hard and there\u2019s something burning in their eyes. They look angry, but it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re angry at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he relents. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I need to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku digs his nails into his thumb and it starts bleeding again. \u201cOkay. Fine. I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rooftop will always be there, he figures. It will always be his backup plan.</p>\n<p>Aizawa nods. \u201cOkay, good. Now what do you want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one that remembers everything that\u2019s happened. What do you think we should do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a moment to think it over.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bunker,\u201d he decides. \u201cLet\u2019s all go down there and stay down there.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bunker was built under the dorms. In the event of a surprise attack on campus, students were supposed to head there. They\u2019ve never had to use it until now.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d always wanted to use the bunker to keep Aizawa and Shinsou safe, but he could never get Aizawa to stay in it. Once, he\u2019d gotten desperate and drugged them both before <em>dragging</em> them into the bunker. But Aizawa had woken up\u2014far too early, even though Izuku had checked the doses over several times to make sure it would keep them down all day\u2014and incapacitated Izuku, thinking he was a villain or was being controlled by one.</p>\n<p>But this time, Aizawa agrees easily. They pack the barebones of supplies and head down to the bunker.</p>\n<p>The strangest thing about being stuck in a time loop is how boring it can be. Before everything, Izuku hadn\u2019t realised that he could feel like climbing out of his skin with anxiety, while also being mind-numbingly bored.</p>\n<p>Right now, he doesn\u2019t have the attention span to focus on reading or homework. If he tries to think more about his situation after the morning he\u2019s had, he\u2019s going to lose it and the last place he wants to break down is in a locked bunker with Aizawa and Shinsou.</p>\n<p>So that just leaves talking to each other.</p>\n<p>Shinsou is the one break the silence: \u201cWhat happened yesterday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried so many other things,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re smart. You could probably keep pulling theories out of your ass. I\u2019ve seen you do it in fights often enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Izuku says weakly.</p>\n<p>Shinsou shakes his head. \u201cSomething must have happened yesterday to make you wake up this morning and decide to go to such extreme measures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou,\u201d Aizawa warns.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Shinsou says, shrugging, though he doesn\u2019t take back the question.</p>\n<p>Izuku fidgets with his hands, thinking the question over. <em>They already know this much,</em> he thinks, too tired to keep his secrets behind the teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI let myself think it was over,\u201d he begins. \u201cYesterday was good. We all connected for the first time. Shinsou and I had a conversation that made us both evaluate how we saw each other.\u201d He glances briefly at Shinsou. \u201cThough I guess you don\u2019t remember that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then the day reset again,\u201d Aizawa finishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, not quite. Then we came back to the dorms and a group of villains ambushed us and made you and I watch as they tortured Shinsou for thirty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Shinsou says, growing white.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the first time someone else came on campus. Every other time had looked like an accident. An explosion, or a sudden fall, or a medical emergency. And it was the most brutal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls on a smile out of habit. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou was the one who was hurt. Well, you were killed after too, but Shinsou was the one they tortured. I\u2019m not sure why exactly, since I\u2019m the one in the Hero Course and the only one who retains any memory of\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Aizawa says again.</p>\n<p>Izuku cuts himself off. He curls around his knees, hands gripping his ankles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not okay. And I\u2019m not going to be until we make it to Sunday alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Or, at least, until Shinsou and Aizawa do.</p>\n<p>Silence fills the bunker. Again, Shinsou breaks it: \u201cYesterday, what kind of conversation did we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs nervously. \u201cWell, I asked why you hated me. You must have thought I\u2019d lost my mind. But it made me realise that we didn\u2019t know each other, not really. We\u2019ve both been making assumptions and not realising it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou\u2019s shoulders tense, drawing away from Izuku, an action so small it almost looks subconscious. \u201cWhat did assumption did you make about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flaps a hand in the air. \u201cOh, you know. That you thought I was annoying and strange, and that you didn\u2019t want to be friends because I\u2019m me, and not because I\u2019m a hero student. And maybe you <em>do</em> think I\u2019m annoying. A lot of people do. I mean, I get it, I know I am. But I hadn\u2019t realised you were wary of me because you\u2019re a Gen Ed student coming into the Hero Course and didn\u2019t expect to be welcome in Class 1-A.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stops. If he keeps going, the momentum is going to carry him deep into incomprehensible muttering and in his current headspace, that could be dangerous.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou stares at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s not on the defensive, Shinsou can be so nice. How could he think he wouldn\u2019t fit in in Class 1-A?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that. I just wanted you to know that don\u2019t need to be wary around me. Or the rest of our class. Most of us will be happy to have you. Well, except for maybe Kacchan, but he looks down on almost everyone. And you should probably apologise to Ojirou, but otherwise, they\u2019re all really nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa has been keeping quiet in the corner, though Izuku can tell he\u2019s watching them closely. This recontextualizes their old conversations, Izuku realises. In high school, Aizawa transferred from General Education to the Hero Course. He knows what it\u2019s like to be in Shinsou\u2019s place. And so maybe, all those times Izuku tried to intervene in training sessions or move their attention away from practise, Aizawa was just trying to look after Shinsou.</p>\n<p>Shinsou still looks doubtful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI made assumptions about Class 1-A too,\u201d Izuku confesses. He hadn\u2019t realised that when he began spilling his secrets, it would be hard to stop. \u201cI thought they wouldn\u2019t like me either. But they\u2019re all really friendly, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou laughs, a raw and derisive sound. \u201c<em>You</em> have a powerful quirk. Why wouldn\u2019t they like you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pauses. Shinsou is sitting in one corner of the bunker, knees up against his chest, looking ready to either lash out or run even though they\u2019re trapped inside the bunker together.</p>\n<p>Izuku knows intimately what that is like.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was quirkless up until the entrance exams,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cBefore UA, school had never been, uh\u2014it had never been <em>nice</em>. I walked into Class 1-A with the same assumptions I had about my middle school classmates, and they all proved me wrong. They keep proving me wrong, every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuirkless until high school,\u201d Shinsou says, mysterifed. \u201cYour quirk manifesting that late? That\u2019s \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Aizawa finishes.</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows. Suddenly, the ache inside his chest is unbearable.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like something inside him, some kind of seal, has been broken: all his secrets come gushing out of him. Today is ephemeral. They\u2019re not going to remember this when the day resets, so why not? Why not?</p>\n<p>So Izuku tells them about One for All.</p>\n<p>It feels so good to get everything out. He keeps talking until his mouth is dry and his eyes are drooping, purging himself of all the secrets that have been festering inside him. It feels so right, like cogs clicking into place, a lock finally being open.</p>\n<p>Izuku rides the wave of euphoria, easily absorbing Shinsou and Aizawa\u2019s shock and their many questions, until he can\u2019t keep his eyes open.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even remember falling asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Izuku wakes up, the door to the bunker is open. Shinsou is gone. Aizawa is in the corner, sweeping something into a small bag.</p>\n<p>Dust, Izuku realises. The entire bunker is covered in a powdery dust.</p>\n<p>He sits up abruptly. Dust rains from his hair, his eyelashes, his chest. He lunges for Aizawa's phone, ignoring his teacher's many missed calls and notifications, fixated on the time and date.\u00a0</p>\n<p>6:58am. Sunday.</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s crying until Aizawa crouches beside him, a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cWe made it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSh-Shinsou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright. He\u2019s just gone to have a shower and wash the dust off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku chokes on another sob, bent over his knees. Aizawa rubs a hand up and down his back, and he can\u2019t help but lean into it. Every time he tries to stop himself from crying, the tears come harder. It doesn\u2019t feel therapeutic. It just hurts.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re alive. Aizawa and Shinsou made it to Sunday.</p>\n<p>Izuku made it, too.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s able to get his breathing under control, he mops up his tears with the sleeve of his sweatshirt and asks, \u201cDo you still believe me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-well, from your perspective I had a mental breakdown and made us sit in the bunker all day, even though nothing happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa gestures at the dust blanketing the bunker like freshly fallen snow. \u201cThere\u2019s been a string of unexplained deaths in Musutafu; five bodies found with no sign of injury, all of them covered in this dust. This has to be the same quirk. But no one has survived it. Until you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we would have all stayed dead,\u201d Izuku realises, stomach sinking. \u201cIf I had jumped, we\u2019d all be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa keeps his hand on Izuku\u2019s back, grounding him. \u201cWe don\u2019t think more than one person has been caught in the villain\u2019s quirk before. We don\u2019t know what would have happened. But we do know that you saved us. You did it, problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t scold him when Izuku breaks down crying again, just keeps rubbing those soothing circles into his back and waits patiently for him to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe person who did this is still out there,\u201d Aizawa says, \u201cbut we\u2019ll catch them. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, feeling sticky with tears and snot, more exhausted than he\u2019s been in his life.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s confused too. And angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think it was?\u201d Izuku asks. \u201cAfter everything I tried, why did the loop finally stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told us,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cYou told us everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scrubs a hand through his hair. A fresh shower of dust falls to the bunker floor. \u201cI feel so useless. After everything, I can\u2019t believe that was the way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know why or how this quirk works. We\u2019ll figure it out. But Izuku, listen to me.\u201d Aizawa moves his hand from Izuku\u2019s back to his shoulder. His eyes suddenly seem so much more intense. He\u2019s not using his quirk but Izuku feels pinned in place. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll believe you. If something like this happens again, or if something or someone is hurting you, or you just need someone to turn to: I promise I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku had thought he was too exhausted for anymore tears.</p>\n<p>He was wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
}
