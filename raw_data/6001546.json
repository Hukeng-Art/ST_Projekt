  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin was already at his desk when Arthur walked by, coffee in one hand and a gift bag in the other. He had only been working as Arthur\u2019s PA for three months, but he had never seen his antisocial boss with a gift before. He didn\u2019t have a clue who the gift could be for in the office. Or maybe Arthur was trying to persuade a business partner to agree to something.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho\u2019s the gift for?\u201d Merlin asked curiously, not thinking his boss would answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou.\u201d Arthur dropped it onto Merlin\u2019s desk without much ceremony. He stood in front of Merlin\u2019s desk, obviously waiting for Merlin to open it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin raised a brow, and slid over to where Arthur had dropped the bag. He peeked inside. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur smiled, but covered his amusement by drinking his coffee. Merlin looked back and forth between the gift and Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d Arthur looked far too pleased, but contained his smile once more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was a stapler. It was gray, but that wasn\u2019t the odd part about it. The stapler was shaped like a dragon head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRemember to staple my reports.\u201d Arthur said, a hint of a smile on his lips, before walking past Merlin\u2019s desk and into his office. Merlin stared at the office door, even after he couldn\u2019t see Arthur anymore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was an odd gift to say the least, but the odd part was that Arthur had never been the type of boss to tease. No, in fact, he was the type of boss to sack someone who didn\u2019t do their job correctly. Like Merlin. He still wasn\u2019t sure why he still had this job, especially since Merlin wasn\u2019t very good at his job and he tended to tease Arthur too much.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin hadn\u2019t been stapling Arthur\u2019s reports since he started this job. Or Arthur\u2019s financial statements, or his letters, or really anything Arthur needed stapling. At first it was because Merlin didn\u2019t have a stapler and he hadn\u2019t a clue how to staple correlated papers on the copy machine. Later though, about a month into his new job with Camelot\u2019s CEO, it was just because of Arthur\u2019s face when he received an unstapled report. He stared at it, one eye twitching and lips tight, and then he looked up at Merlin like he was a heathen. It was quite funny. Two months later Merlin had actually forgotten that he needed to staple reports.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked at the dragon head stapler and smiled a bit, because instead of sacking Merlin, Arthur had decided to fight fire with fire. It was unexpected and Merlin had half expected a pink slip in the bag. Merlin opened the stapler and filled it with staples, extremely happy that Arthur could tease back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a pile of papers in his hand, Merlin walked into Arthur\u2019s office. He looked up at Merlin with a raised brow when Merlin stood in front of his desk wordlessly. Merlin held up the papers, then the stapler, making a show of stapling them. Then he put the report on Arthur\u2019s desk with a cheeky smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Merlin.\u201d Arthur said, looking very pleased with himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sir.\u201d Merlin said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin went back to his desk and waited. It only took ten minutes before he heard Arthur\u2019s curse from inside his office. He must have seen the papers were stapled upside down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerlin? What in the world are you doing here?\u201d Arthur asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Merlin looked down at himself, his pressed slacks and blue button up. Then at Arthur\u2019s desk and Arthur, his white shirt rolled to his elbows. It was afternoon, and Merlin was fairly sure he had seen Arthur that morning. He tried to think if he needed to be anywhere, but couldn\u2019t think of anything. \u201cI work here?\u201d Merlin answered dumbly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I know that, </span>\n<em>\n<span>thank you.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Arthur rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy are you still here? Don\u2019t you have a half day?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do?\u201d Merlin asked again, wondering if Arthur was messing with him. Arthur always asked Merlin to stay late. He never actually </span>\n<em>\n<span>had </span>\n</em>\n<span>to stay late, but Arthur offered him over-time compensation and Arthur always looked so desperate when he asked. Besides, after working for Arthur for the last couple months, he was more like a friend than a boss. It was a favor more than anything else.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, you do. I thought I sent you that email\u2026\u201d Arthur turned to his laptop, skimmed through something and then made a grimacing face. \u201cI forgot to send it. I\u2019m sorry, and I suppose it's too late to make plans now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlans?\u201d Merlin asked, looking down at the reports. He forgot what he was going to tell Arthur about them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, is it not?\u201d Arthur asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Merlin said, as if he had forgotten. He hadn\u2019t, but he was surprised that Arthur knew. \u201cYeah, but I was going to wait until the weekend to go out. Can\u2019t really celebrate on a Wednesday night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed, \u201cTrue. But you can have a half-day.\u201d Arthur stood up and took the reports from Merlin\u2019s hand, \u201cI can handle myself for the rest of today.\u201d After being Arthur\u2019s PA for this long, Merlin didn\u2019t really think he could. But a half-day sounded nice...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t even have anything to do.\u201d Merlin said, wondering if he had time to pick up the potted plant soil he needed for his houseplants. He could go home and read a book, which was always relaxing. Maybe he would call his mum and thank her for birthing him. That was a good idea.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow then.\u201d Arthur said, already thumbing through the reports. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked at Arthur and then thought about the rest of his evening. Merlin cleared his throat. \u201cWould you like to get dinner? I don\u2019t have plans tonight for my birthday. It might be nice to spend it with a friend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur looked up, surprised. Merlin wondered if he had gone too far by calling his boss his friend. Except, Arthur didn\u2019t look offended. He was smiling and maybe looking shy, which was oddly endearing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll treat you to dinner. As a birthday present. For a friend.\u201d Arthur said, almost sounding like he was trying out the words himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later that night, Arthur bought Merlin a very nice dinner and ridiculous expensive wine. Merlin got drunk off the wine, and Arthur questioned his alcohol tolerance. Then Arthur half-walked, half-carried Merlin home. At his doorstep he wished Merlin a happy birthday. Merlin hugged him, because he always ended up being a tactile drunk, and said that he had a good birthday because of Arthur. Merlin thought that the blush on his face afterwards wasn\u2019t because of the wine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Apparently Merlin had been the first PA to last more than five months, which just proved Merlin\u2019s skill. Either that or Arthur\u2019s desperation for any PA who was willing to put up with his quirks. Probably the later, since Merlin was actually quite fond of Arthur\u2019s quirks. \u00a0On the five-month-marker, Arthur declared that Merlin was a miracle and he was taking Merlin out to lunch. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Going to lunch and then dinner after work had become a common affair. No longer employer and employee, or even coworkers, Arthur and Merlin had become friends. Arthur was still a bit of a workaholic, and Merlin took more overtime than normal, but they saw it as a favor between friends rather than a burden. Plus, Arthur always made sure to pay Merlin for over time, and buy him food while they slaved over reports.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So when Christmas came around, it made perfect sense that they had dinner plans before their week-long holiday. Arthur put the restaurant expenses on the business and they enjoyed the evening together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the end of the night, Merlin pulled out Arthur\u2019s Christmas present and slid it across the table. \u201cHappy Christmas\u201d Merlin said, smiling widely. Arthur gave him a dubious look, but still took the present.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After pulling out the tissue paper, Arthur simply said \u201cIt's a plain coffee mug.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin grinned, \u201cNope.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur narrowed his eyes at Merlin and then examined the cup, turning it upside down. Arthur laughed and Merlin felt butterflies flutter in his stomach.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo when you drink everyone can see.\u201d Merlin said proudly. It had taken him two hours of searching on the Internet to find the mug. On the bottom of the mug, which could be read when Arthur drank, it proudly proclaimed \u2018I'm a prat!\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonestly, Merlin?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Merlin said. \u201cCome on, I thought you'd like. It's practical. You're always telling me to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>practical</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Which was true. Arthur was still trying to make Merlin be a reasonable good PA, which was a losing battle. Merlin admired Arthur\u2019s determination though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, of course. I'll bring it to board meetings, shall I?\u201d Arthur snorted out a laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerfect. I think the board should get some too. Like \u2018I'm a twat.\u2019 And \u2018I'm old and not willing to change my mind.\u2019\u201d Merlin suggested. The board of the company really was a pain in Arthur\u2019s ass, a bunch of old men from Uther\u2019s Old Guard, but Merlin was confident that Arthur would sort them out when the time came.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat will be hard to fit on a mug.\u201d Arthur commented.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin shrugged and then leaned forward with excitement. \u201cSo what did you get me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho said I got you anything?\u201d Arthur asked, \u201cMaybe I don't want to give it to you now.\u201d He gestured to his mug.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Merlin whined, making it eyes wide and clasped his hands in front of him. Arthur always fell for it when Merlin pretended to play nice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed as he pulled out the bag, falling for it easily. He slid it over to Merlin, \u201cHappy Christmas. You're still the worst assistant I have ever had.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Merlin rolled his eyes as he grabbed the bag. \u201cThat's why you haven't sacked me yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin opened the present and pulled out what appeared to be a lump of red and white fabric. He unfolded it, to reveal a Christmas sweater with white reindeer and pine trees, which was covered in gold glitter. There were sequins and beads adorning the holiday patterns, falling all over Merlin\u2019s lap. It was glittering in its festivity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDear god I'm going to be covered in glitter.\u201d Merlin said, already looking at his glitter covered hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt's perfect then.\u201d Arthur said, \u201cTo match your glittering personality.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin laughed, looking at the sweater. He wished he hated it, but it was just the thing he would wear on Christmas morning when Will and his Mum opened presents. Will would hate it, and scoff at Merlin\u2019s glitter. His mother would love it, but would ask him to clean up the couch where he sat because it would be covered in glitter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur coughed when Merlin didn't say anything. Merlin realized he had been smiling down at the sweater, probably looking all too pleased about a gag-gift. Arthur made an awkward gesture with his hands, \u201cYou also have an extra week off after Christmas. I'm sure your mum will appreciate having you an extra week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou're giving me a week off to spend time with my mum?\u201d Merlin asked, a little dumbfounded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you can do anything you want. It's your week off.\u201d Arthur said, looking down with a shrug. \u201cI just figured you'd be with your family.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked down to his sweater, thinking again of Christmas morning. He wondered what he would do with an extra week after Christmas.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you taking an extra week?\u201d Merlin asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but I rather not spend more time with my father and Morgana than I already do.\u201d Arthur said. Merlin understood that, since Arthur worked with his family. Merlin only saw his mum when they Skyped or he had a free weekend to drive to Wales.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould you want to come to Ealdor?\u201d Merlin asked, suddenly wanting Arthur to be there with him. His mother would love Arthur. \u201cNew Year's is always rather boring at home. You might be entertaining enough for that small town.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDear God you live in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, don't you?\u201d Arthur laughed. \u201cWould I know the whole town by the end of one visit?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but everyone would know you. It's Ealdor, everyone knows everyone.\u201d Merlin said with a smile, \u201cWhen I came out, the whole town knew within two days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur paused in the middle of taking his drink. He looked at Merlin oddly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did know I was bi, right?\u201d Merlin paused, wondering if it had ever come up. He usually didn't bring it up when he was at work, just because he considered his private and work lives separate. He wondered if his sexuality would be a problem with Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur drank and then continued the conversation. \u201cNo, you never mentioned it. In that case, you probably didn't know I was gay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou're </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Merlin\u2019s fear of Arthur\u2019s disapproval quickly turned to shock. He watched Arthur\u2019s face for a sign of a joke, but he appeared to be serious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed at Merlin's wide-eyed surprise. \u201cI don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing that reaction.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell you're just-\u201d Merlin gestured helplessly to Arthur\u2019s appearing straight-ness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur raised a brow, waiting expectantly for Merlin to put his foot in his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, yeah. That's fair.\u201d Merlin shrugged. \u201cI suppose I thought if you were gay you would be the type of bloke to have a boyfriend. Unless you do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m a straight-looking workaholic who\u2019s only been on one date with a man. No, I don't think I'm the type of bloke to have a boyfriend.\u201d Arthur said, grumbling a bit to himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin made a sympathetic noise, knowing how he too had had to prove his queerness to some people. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, my last boyfriend dumped me because he thought all bisexuals cheat on their partners.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur scrunched up his face, \u201cGod, what a loser.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Merlin said, \u201cAnyways, you should make the trip to Wales. I'll take you ice skating on the pond outside my mum\u2019s house. You can watch me fall on my ass, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur smiled, \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin smiled and \u00a0lifted his glass in toast \u201cHappy Christmas?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur clinked his glass against Merlin\u2019s \u201cHappy Christmas, Merlin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the new year, the Arthur and the company were hitting the ground running. Merlin and Arthur\u2019s holiday was fun, but only a week back into work and Arthur was scheduling a large scale board meeting. Merlin was organizing the boardroom before Arthur\u2019s meeting, when a woman in a business suit walked in. She stopped in the doorway and stared at him without a greeting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cErm\u2026 May I help you?\u201d He asked, looking at the table with freshly printed out reports and then back at the woman. \u201cThe meeting is in an hour.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She waved a hand, as if to push away the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m here to see you. You are Merlin Emrys, are you not?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cErm, yes? Who are you?\u201d Merlin asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Morgana Pendragon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Jesus, does Arthur know you\u2019re early?\u201d Merlin gaped, probably not making a good first impression. Morgana was beautiful and terrifying, just as Arthur had described. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin had never met Morgana, despite the fact that she was a representative of the company. She worked out of country, and Merlin hadn\u2019t recognized the woman in front of him from the the picture Arthur had on his desk, from when she was eight and Arthur was five.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morgana smiled, \u201cMy reputation precedes me. And no, my baby brother doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here. Yet.\u201d She walked up to Merlin and extended a hand of greeting. \u201cI heard you\u2019re the PA that lasted longer than anyone else. I had to meet you. Arthur seems oddly fond of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d Merlin answered, \u201cAnd I seem to be the only PA willing to put up with him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morgana snorted out a laugh, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Merlin could answer, Morgana was suddenly very close and eyeing him. He looked down, wondering if he had spilled something on himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She tugged at his scarf. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked down at the scarf. It had woodland creatures frolicking around it: orange foxes, cotton-tailed bunnies, and spotted deer. Arthur had given it to him as a joke last week because he said he saw the scarf and thought of all the weird scarves Merlin wore to work. It was actually very nice of Arthur, even if he meant it as a joke. Merlin wore it half to annoy Arthur and half because he honestly liked the scarf, not that he would tell Arthur that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArthur gave it to me.\u201d Merlin said, looking down at the prancing foxes. He wasn\u2019t sure how to explain their sort-of prank war. Mostly Merlin teased and Arthur got him weird things in return. It worked for them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe...</span>\n<em>\n<span>gave</span>\n</em>\n<span> it...to you?\u201d Morgana repeated, staring at him. She was dumbfounded, and though Merlin did not know her, he was aware that this was a sight to behold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Merlin clarified. \u201cWe have this ongoing joke, in a way. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d Now that he thought about it, Arthur giving him gifts was a very odd joke to explain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morgana eyed him like he was from outer space. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Merlin squeaked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArthur Pendragon gave you a </span>\n<em>\n<span>gift</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Morgana said, as if that was odd. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked down at the scarf. \u201cIt\u2019s not that weird. I like it.\u201d Merlin felt the need to defend the scarf. He actually liked the woodland creatures a lot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Morgana shook her head, \u201cNo, see you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Morgana took him by the shoulder and pulled him close as if to divulge a secret. \u201cArthur Pendragon does not give good gifts. He is actually the worst gift-giver in all of England.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh come on, the scarf isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Merlin said, now kind of insulted for the piece of fabric.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerlin, the scarf is perfect for you. It\u2019s a good gift. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Arthur doesn\u2019t give good gifts.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course he does! Who\u2019s bad at giving gifts? That\u2019s absurd.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh he can give gifts just fine, but they\u2019re not particularly nice or perfect for the person. He gives fruit baskets to his business partners. His father receives a tie every Christmas. I am almost always guaranteed the same fragrance body lotion on my birthday.\u201d Morgana explained.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin eyed Morgana as if she was the crazy one now. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It's a bit\u2026 organized but Arthur\u2019s, you know...bad with people.\u201d An understatement, but Merlin let it stand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, believe me Merlin. After twenty-seven years with him, I\u2019m well aware of how bad he is with people.\u201d Morgana said plainly. \u201cWhich is why I don\u2019t understand how he gave you a perfect gift without even thinking about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s had to have given one good gift!\u201d Merlin said, trying to defend Arthur, though Morgana\u2019s description was starting to add up with Arthur\u2019s personality more than the odd gifts that Merlin had been receiving. Merlin had never wondered about the gifts until that point. To Merlin, they weren\u2019t gifts in the same way other people gave gifts. They were more like pieces of Arthur\u2019s emotions. Arthur was annoyed, he gave Merlin a stapler. Arthur was amused, he gave Merlin a sparkly sweater. It was just the way Arthur worked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis gifts can be grand, but they never match up with people.\u201d Morgana pointed out. \u201cA couple years back he gave his girlfriend a diamond necklace.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell that doesn\u2019t seem bad at all-\u201d Merlin was cut off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe broke up with him the next week. Apparently they hadn\u2019t been doing well and she was just there for the expensive gifts.\u201d Morgana said harshly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin flinched. He had the impulse to find the girl and yell at her, or maybe set his mother loose on her. Looking back, Arthur had probably been confused, since he had come out to Merlin as gay. It seemed like Arthur had just been trying to do what he thought was expected. Arthur did have tendencies to do what people expected of him, though he had done that less and less recently. Merlin looked down at the scarf, which was anything but expected.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy point is,\u201d Morgana continued. \u201cArthur gives okay-gifts at the best of times. But apparently he gives you perfect gifts without thought.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin thought of the stapler, his birthday dinner, and the sweater. He remembered his extra week off at Christmas when Arthur visited Ealdor. Arthur had bought his mum flowers, argued with Will, and then laughed his ass off as Merlin\u2019s entire body slid across the icy pond. In an odd way, having Arthur there was part of the gift.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright\u2026 You have a point, but what does that mean?\u201d Merlin asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morgana grinned at him. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s for me to find out. Just keep being your adorable, scarf-wearing self.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin was about to protest, but Arthur walked in. He looked like the time Merlin had spilled hot coffee on him, eyes wide and face red.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMorgana, I thought you were going to be here in an hour?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Arthur I was just meeting your PA. After all, you talk about him all the time.\u201d Morgana said pointedly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked to Arthur, who actually seemed to blush. Well, that was interesting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd that scarf\u2026 It looks so familiar.\u201d Morgana said, fondling Merlin\u2019s scarf.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, yes I\u2019m sure.\u201d Arthur coughed, \u201cIt\u2019s like every other scarf in those boutiques-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I think I remember this one. Merlin, does your scarf have rabbits on it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked down. Then he looked Morgana, who was smiling, and then to Arthur who was pale and looked like he wanted the ground to swallow him up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cErm...Yes?\u201d Merlin said, not sure where this was going.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I remember going shopping at this boutique with Arthur a couple weeks ago. He wanted me to come with him to buy a scarf. The boutique was quite expensive. Practically on the other side of the city from Arthur\u2019s apartment. Arthur said something about a scarf and bunnies and how it reminded him of someone. There was something about ears. Or was it a nice cotton tail?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay! That\u2019s enough.\u201d Arthur spluttered. \u201cThere is no need- Morgana would you like to have a coffee? A glass of the most expensive wine I can find? Anything to get you out of this room?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy thank you Arthur, that would be lovely.\u201d Morgana grinned. \u201cMerlin, it was nice meeting you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cErm.\u201d Merlin said, watching Arthur dragged his sister out of the boardroom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Merlin peeked his head out of the boardroom he heard incoherent cursing from both siblings. Merlin decided to stay far away from them as possible. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It didn\u2019t take long for Merlin to figure out he was attracted to Arthur. After all, Arthur was very handsome, with his chiseled cheekbones, blond hair, and pouty lips. Not to mention his broad shoulders and nice ass. Both of which looked exceptional in a suit, which just happened to be his work clothes. It was a quiet torture for Merlin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Merlin first worked at Camelot, he was just the bad PA who couldn\u2019t (wouldn\u2019t) staple his boss\u2019 reports. Then he was Arthur\u2019s friend. Now that they were close friends Merlin felt more than just attraction. He was fond of Arthur, and on multiple occasions he had imagined what it would be like if their after-work dinners were dates.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Merlin decided that if Arthur wanted to ask him out, he would have done it by now. Plus, if they didn\u2019t work out, Merlin might have to quit his job and he really couldn\u2019t afford to be unemployed. And he had grown rather fond of Arthur, and Merlin was slowly figuring out that he would be devastated if Arthur and he weren\u2019t friends. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fortunately, or unfortunately, on Friday night Merlin found out what being on a date with Arthur would be like. Arthur and Merlin went out to dinner after work, which wasn\u2019t an uncommon occurrence. The only difference was that they had both forgotten it was the night before Valentine\u2019s Day. Apparently many of the couples had decided to start their love-festivities early because the restaurant was filled with couples. There was love in the air. Literally, there was quite love songs playing in the background.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Every waitress that stopped by their booth thought that they were a couple. The waitress offered them champagne and strawberries over and over again. She reminded them that if they wanted the Lover\u2019s Lava Cake that they needed to order if thirty minutes ahead of time. After the third protest, that </span>\n<em>\n<span>no </span>\n</em>\n<span>they were </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>a couple, and the waitress insisting that the restuarant accepted couples of </span>\n<em>\n<span>all types</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Merlin finally broke down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus Christ, just get us a bottle of champagne.\u201d Merlin hissed to the waitress. \u201cThen </span>\n<em>\n<span>leave us alone</span>\n</em>\n<span>. My husband and I want to spend this night </span>\n<em>\n<span>alone</span>\n</em>\n<span>, if you catch my drift.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The waitress didn\u2019t seem offended, just went back to the kitchen and came back with a large bottle of champagne and a dish of strawberries.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur was staring at Merlin. His eyes were wide.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin munched on a strawberry. Angrily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHusband? Really, Merlin?\u201d Arthur looked on the verge of laughter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d Merlin protested, taking a large gulp of the champagne.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d Arthur took up the champagne, \u201cBetter not let this go to waste.\u201d He popped the bottle and poured to two glasses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur held up his glass. \u201cI suppose...Happy Valentines Day?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin knocked his glass with Arthur\u2019s. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s day, darling.\u201d He winked and Arthur choked into his champagne. Merlin grinned, probably enjoying Arthur\u2019s confusion far too much for any good friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After that, they drank the entire bottle of champagne and Merlin proved again that he had a low alcohol tolerance. By the end of the meal Merlin had slid across the curved booth so that he was next to Arthur, who had an arm around Merlin. At first it had been because Merlin had fallen over and Arthur righted him, but then his arm hadn\u2019t moved. It was warm and Merlin didn\u2019t mind. Then the Lover\u2019s Lava Cake arrived and Merlin didn\u2019t really mind that they hadn\u2019t ordered it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMm, Arthur we aren\u2019t a couple.\u201d Merlin mumbled, knowing he was speaking the obvious but not really in control of his thought-to-mouth filter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Arthur said, looking down at Merlin, licking his lips around the chocolate cake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d Merlin squinted up at Arthur. His hair was like a golden halo in the dimmed lights.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Arthur asked, taking the last bite of the lava cake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we a couple? We\u2019d be a good couple. We\u2019d get champagne and cake all the time. People would shower us in food just for our gay love.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin felt Arthur\u2019s laughter as he rested his head against Arthur\u2019s shoulder. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think you\u2019re drunk, Merlin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You\u2019re</span>\n</em>\n<span> drunk.\u201d Merlin whined back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed, \u201cWhatever you say. Want the last strawberry?\u201d Arthur offered, holding out the fruit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin leaned forward and wrapped his lips around the strawberry, only leaving the stem in Arthur's hand. He licked his lips and didn\u2019t think much of it until he noticed that Arthur had frozen. Merlin looked up at Arthur, and he sobered a little, rethinking his actions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI might be drunker than I thought.\u201d Merlin said dumbly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur cleared his throat. \u201cI might be a little drunker than I thought too.\u201d Arthur waved for the check and Merlin used the gesture to slip out of Arthur\u2019s hold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning Merlin woke up in his own bed with only a slight hangover. It was a small mercy, because Merlin still remembered how he had cuddled up to Arthur the night before. He had wanted Arthur so badly, the alcohol clouding his mind as he longed for even the horribly-themed Valentine\u2019s date. He groaned and covered his face with his arms, wanting his bed to swallow him whole so he didn\u2019t have to go into work on Monday.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin screamed, jumping out of his sheets in a second. He clutched the sheets to his naked chest as he looked up to see Arthur in his bedroom doorway. Arthur\u2019s eyes were wide, probably shocked at Merlin\u2019s scream, but now he looked more amused than surprised. Merlin tried to remember the night before, but all he remembered was the cab ride back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dropped you off, but\u2026\u201d Arthur said, picking up Merlin\u2019s train of thought. \u201cYou were more drunk than I expected and I didn\u2019t want to leave you alone. I crashed on your couch. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin relaxed, relieved that they hadn\u2019t ruined their friendship and touched that Arthur had decided to look after him even though they both knew he hadn\u2019t been that drunk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you have a hangover?\u201d Arthur asked, already handing Merlin a glass of water.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot really. The food probably helped.\u201d Merlin said, drinking down the water and the medication Arthur gave him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re odd when you\u2019re drunk. You gave me socks.\u201d Arthur said, pointing down to his feet where Merlin\u2019s wool socks covered Arthur\u2019s feet. \u201cYou insisted I would be cold without them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe sitting room is the coldest part of the apartment.\u201d Merlin said, faintly remembering pulling out socks for Arthur. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur sat next to him on the bed. They needed to talk about what had almost happened last night. Merlin couldn\u2019t help but wish everything that had happened was the truth, instead of some drunk almost-Valentine's day almost-date. He wished Arthur wearing his socks was normal; that he could warm his feet under the sheets of Merlin\u2019s bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerlin\u2026\u201d Arthur said slowly, pulling Merlin out of his thoughts. Merlin didn\u2019t want to look Arthur in the eye, so he looked at his chest only in his white undershirt. \u201cCan we talk? About last night?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin let out a long sigh. Then he nodded. \u201cWe probably should.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur nodded minutely before pulling something from his pocket. It was a box of chocolates, a dark red box that said in white letters \u2018Be My Valentine\u2019 in cursive letters. Merlin looked to Arthur, whose eyes looked a little scared as he held out the chocolates.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked down at the box of chocolates, which looked like they were handmade truffles. Arthur had to have planned it beforehand. Or at least, planned a little before that morning, because those chocolates were handmade and the lettering on top had Merlin\u2019s name.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLast night, I didn\u2019t know the restaurant was going to be so...</span>\n<em>\n<span>romantic</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I brought you out to dinner with the hope of asking you out, and then things escalated, quite oddly too. I wanted to wait.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin was at a loss for words.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur swallowed before asking, \u201cBe mine?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked at the box of chocolates, which he sure were far too nice and Merlin would eat far too quickly. Then he looked at Arthur, who was looking at him with earnest eyes. Merlin smiled, taking the box of chocolates and placing them on his nightstand. He wrapped a hand around the nape of Arthur\u2019s neck and whispered \u201cYeah\u201d as he pulled Arthur close to kiss him, their noses bumping and his lips capturing Arthur\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChocolates on Valentine\u2019s Day. You\u2019re soppy.\u201d Merlin said, between kisses, as Arthur clung onto Merlin\u2019s waist. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything better\u201d Arthur said, running his lips along Merlin\u2019s cheek. \u201cIs it okay?\u201d He sounded a little nervous, his voice wavering as Merlin\u2019s hand ran into his hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin remembered what Morgana had said about Arthur\u2019s gifts always being planned out. Maybe that led to typical or cheesy presents, but they were from the heart. If Arthur\u2019s gifts were his emotions, than Merlin wanted every heart shaped chocolate box Arthur had to offer. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin kissed Arthur again, answering him with an equally soppy phrase. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With Arthur, it was fairly easy for Merlin to go from friend to boyfriend. Not a lot had changed since they still worked together and they went out to dinner afterwards. The only real difference was that they stayed over at each other\u2019s places and woke up in the morning together. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The gifts didn\u2019t stop either. The gifts were nothing grand, and Merlin was grateful that Arthur understood him well enough to know he didn\u2019t want big gifts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go all out.\u201d Merlin had told him once, to which Arthur promised. Merlin understood that buying gifts \u00a0was one of the few ways Arthur knew how to properly show affection. He was still awkward when they were out in public and wasn\u2019t the type of man who could be spontaneous. So Merlin let Arthur buy him odd gifts every once and awhile. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The fluffy pen and the glittery notepad sat on Merlin\u2019s desk, along with other office supplies Arthur had thought were funny. But Merlin also remembered the other gifts: the knit hat to keep him warm, the cologne for date nights, and the night Arthur came home with Merlin\u2019s favorite wine and a promise to make him go mad all night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sometimes the gifts were typical boyfriend gifts, like the cologne. Merlin still loved them, odd or normal, and returned the gifts in his own way. Little kisses on his head when they were alone in Arthur\u2019s office, telling him the truth when he needed to hear it, and making sure Arthur got out of the office even when he thought he needed to work over his lunch break.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So when Arthur\u2019s birthday came around in the summer, Merlin decided it was time to turn the tables. He still couldn\u2019t afford a large gesture, but he could think of a good gift for Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got me...a jar of full of paper?\u201d Arthur asked as he looked at the present. They were sitting on Merlin\u2019s bed, after a relaxing dinner at home. Arthur said that was all he wanted, so Merlin compiled easily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Merlin said, \u201cOpen it, you dork. They\u2019re not blank.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur opened the jar and took out one of the papers. \u201cIt says \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d He looked up at Merlin dubiously. \u201cI love you too, babe, but this is weird even for you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up. It\u2019s a jar of all the reasons I love you. I thought you\u2019d like them when you need a reminder. Not like your big head needs it.\u201d Merlin knew Arthur needed it more than he would ever admit, so Merlin was willing to remind him how good he was. Arthur flipped through the papers, reading \u2018Because you make me smile.\u2019 \u2018Because you take care of me,\u2019 \u2018Because you\u2019re dedicated,\u2019 and \u2018Because you\u2019re a good man.\u2019 Arthur was silent as he looked through them, his face blank, which made Merlin nervous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin cleared his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t really afford a big gift, and you don\u2019t need anything expensive, so\u2026\u201d Merlin made a gesture as if to say \u2018ta-da.\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur looked up at him, his eyes hard on Merlin. He grabbed Merlin\u2019s shirt and tugged him forward, kissed him suddenly, the papers spilling over his lap as he pulled Merlin close. \u201cI love it. I love you.\u201d Arthur pressed Merlin down into the bed, the papers falling over them, and Merlin ignored them as he held Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect. Thank you, Merlin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d Merlin said as he held Arthur close.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two years seemed to fly by for Merlin. Merlin had known Arthur for at least three years, but it had been at least two years since their first kiss on that fateful Valentine\u2019s Day. A lot had changed in that time. Arthur had altered many parts of his company and Merlin had been there every step of the way. Merlin had developed into a relatively decent PA, and he was taking more and more responsibility within the company. Being at work had become a partnership, just as it was outside of work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A lot had appeared to remain the same though. They still had dinner dates after work. Merlin still wasn\u2019t that good of a PA. Arthur still gave Merlin gifts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin still lived in his crappy apartment, which had been the only place he could afford without a flatmate three years ago. But Arthur\u2019s company paid him well, and he probably could afford better now. Except, it seemed odd to move out of his apartment. He still couldn\u2019t afford anything much nicer. Merlin stayed at Arthur\u2019s place most of the time. At first it was because it was closer to work, then it was because Merlin liked Arthur\u2019s bathtub, and then it was because Merlin\u2019s stuff had migrated over there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It only seemed fitting that Arthur\u2019s next gift, wasn\u2019t really a gift at all. Because Merlin asked him for it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was a weekend night and they were lying in bed- Arthur\u2019s bed- when Merlin brought it up. \u201cWe should move in together.\u201d Merlin said, looking up at the ceiling rather than Arthur, who was sitting up against pillows reading a book.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur looked down to him, giving Merlin a slightly amused smile. \u201cOh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin turned to him. \u201cWe practically live together already. We\u2019re in a stable relationship. It makes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to move in here?\u201d Arthur asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin bit his lip. It was what he wanted, but he was never one to ask for things, and he wasn\u2019t an entitled ass. He knew that was too much to ask, even of a long term boyfriend. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d Merlin said carefully. \u201cI mean, we could get another place. One that isn\u2019t mine or yours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur closed his book and set it on the bedside table. He opened a drawer and pulled something out. Merlin heard a metallic click and then Arthur was turning to him again, holding a key between his thumb and index finger. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUntil then.\u201d Arthur put the key in Merlin\u2019s hand. \u201cThis place is ours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin felt the key\u2019s metal warm under his touch. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind if I moved out of my place?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI rather have you here.\u201d Arthur said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Merlin asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerlin.\u201d Arthur said, cupping Merlin\u2019s cheek and kissing him soundly enough to reassure him. \u201cMove in with me. We\u2019ll think about a new apartment- but for now. Stay exactly where you are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Months later, Merlin and Arthur walked into their apartment. There were still a few boxes that needed unpacking, but most had been sifted through and organized. It was an ordinary Friday evening. Arthur had taken Merlin out to dinner after a long week, and there wasn\u2019t anything planned for the evening or even the weekend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have something for you.\u201d Arthur said as they walked into the apartment, pulling off his shoes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cA gift?\u201d Merlin asked, looking Arthur up and down. It was an ordinary Friday. Merlin didn\u2019t remember any reason for giving gifts. If Arthur wanted to give him a gag gift, he usually just tossed it to Merlin with a smirk and then walked away. Arthur pulled out a bottle of wine- a nice wine- and poured two glasses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t look so concerned.\u201d Arthur laughed, \u201cCome on.\u201d He took Merlin\u2019s hand and guided him into their front room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin stood in shock for a moment as he stared at the huge box in the middle of the room. It was red with a gold bow, and was big enough that it reached Merlin\u2019s hip. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not an office chair is it? Because you didn\u2019t need to wrap it, if it is.\u201d Merlin said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s bedazzled I draw the line at accepting your office-related gifts from now on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed again, \u201cIt\u2019s not a chair.\u201d Arthur led him to the couch, sitting him down. Arthur curled up next to Merlin with his feet under himself. He sipped his wine, waiting for Merlin to open the gift. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin looked to Arthur, who gave Merlin a cocky smile. Merlin didn\u2019t have a clue what was sitting in front of him, but Arthur seemed proud of himself. He might as well open it to humor Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin tore off the red paper and tore open the box. Inside there was packing foam and Merlin half hoped it was a bedazzled office chair. He would make Arthur assemble it, Merlin thought happily. \u00a0Merlin dug through the foam, making it spill everywhere. He threw some on Arthur just for fun, to which his boyfriend protested and threw some back. Once Merlin dug through the foam, he found another wrapped gift, only a little bit smaller than the original gift. The same red paper. The same gold bow. But smaller. Merlin looked at it and then at Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur made a noncommittal face at him, shrugging his shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin had to drag this present out of the larger box, which wasn\u2019t too heavy. He kicked away the other box so that he could set this one down, and then he ripped the red paper and threw it in the growing pile of wrappings. He opened the box and found bubble wrap. And another present.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Arthur</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Merlin whined, which made Arthur laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you going to make me </span>\n<em>\n<span>work </span>\n</em>\n<span>for this gift?\u201d Merlin raised a brow at Arthur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThink of it as a reward for opening the gift.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow many boxes are this Russian nesting doll of a present?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur sipped his wine, his smile giving away his amusement. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin groaned, mostly just to see Arthur laugh at him. Arthur nudged him, encouraging him to continue. \u201cCome on, love.\u201d He leaned close to Merlin and waited.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d Merlin said, pulling out the next box. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah I\u2019m just </span>\n<em>\n<span>the worst</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Arthur snorted. \u201cGiving my boyfriend a gift. Because I love him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin was halfway through ripping off the red paper of the next gift when he looked up. Merlin hooked his finger into Arthur\u2019s tie and pulled him forward, pecking a kiss to his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re still a prat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur smiled as he nuzzled his nose against Merlin\u2019s. \u201cSo you keep telling me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin rolled his eyes and went back to the presents, and the pile of wrapping which was overwhelming their living room. Sometimes Merlin thought a box was the last one, but then he opened it and there was a lead weight to make it appear as if it was the last one. After box upon box, after loads upon loads of packing foam, there finally appeared to be an end.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The box in Merlin\u2019s lap was in fact, a chocolate box about the size of a tissue box.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>make me unwrap all that\u201d Merlin gestured to the dozens of boxes on the floor, \u201cJust for </span>\n<em>\n<span>chocolates</span>\n</em>\n<span>. They better be fantastic chocolates, Arthur.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMight as well open it and find out.\u201d Arthur grinned, almost daring him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin popped open the lid, looking over the chocolates in their individual wrappers. His eyes landed on the center, where instead of a chocolate there was a velvet box.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur moved, his hand a steady pressure on Merlin\u2019s leg as he settled on the floor in front of Merlin. He had one knee bent and he was looking up at Merlin with such a serious expression. Everything clicked, and Merlin felt a rush of adrenaline kick into him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Arthur</span>\n</em>\n<span>...\u201d He breathed out, looking down at the little red box. Merlin felt Arthur\u2019s hand on his leg, his eyes not able to look away from the little box amongst the chocolates. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOpen it, Merlin.\u201d Arthur said, his voice hushed and suddenly so different than only a moment before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin pulled out the box, setting the chocolates aside. He lifted the lid, heart pounding. Inside there was a silver ring with a band of gold vines adorned with diamonds. It was beautiful, taking any words on the tip of Merlin\u2019s tongue away. Merlin looked away from the ring, and down to Arthur. Arthur was smiling, but it was small and tentative as he watched Merlin with wide eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"If you'll have me,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cI will love you for the rest of my days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin reached out a hand to cup Arthur's jaw, looking into his face. Arthur's brows pulled together and there was a nervous twitch in his jaw. But he was holding onto Merlin\u2019s knee tightly, as if he needed to be grounded. Merlin thought of a lot of things in that moment, but he knew the one constant in all his thoughts was Arthur. Arthur\u2019s gifts were always a part of him, and in this single velvet box, Arthur offered Merlin all of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span> \"I'll have you.\" Merlin said softly his lips pulling into a smile. \"Yes, Arthur. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur let out a breath he must have been holding and leaned into Merlin's hand. He pressed a kiss to Merlin\u2019s palm. Arthur reached over and took the ring from its place in the box, eyes on Merlin as he slipped it onto Merlin's finger. Arthur bent down and kissed the ring over Merlin\u2019s finger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Come here.\" Merlin pulled Arthur forward, cupping his face and kissing him tenderly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerlin.\u201d Arthur whispered against his lips. He moved so that he was lying on the couch next to Merlin, their legs tangled together. Arthur laid his head on Merlin\u2019s shoulder, his arm resting on Merlin\u2019s chest. Merlin held up his own hand to look at the ring in the firelight, seeing the diamonds reflect against the silver and gold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Arthur asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin smiled and nodded. \u201cYeah. Did you search for it for ages?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur laughed, \u201cYou don\u2019t even want to know.\u201d Merlin figured Arthur had taken a long to time to pick out a ring. A long time ago they had casually spoken about marriage, and all that would entail. They hadn\u2019t meant for themselves, but in the back of Merlin\u2019s mind he had wondered if one day\u2026 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Did you think I'd say anything else?\" Merlin asked, before he suddenly burst out laughing. \"Why did you make me unwrap all those boxes, you </span>\n<em>\n<span>ass</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I thought this was a joke!\" He looked over at the pile of wrapping paper, and then at the little box of chocolates which reminded him of their first kiss.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur pressed a kiss to Merlin's jaw and tucked his head into Merlin's neck as if embarrassed. \"Well, I figured after all that,\" Arthur said referring to the mountain of boxes in their front room \u201cIf you said yes, then you would really mean it.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Jesus Christ, Arthur.\" Merlin could help the fond tone despite it all. He held Arthur's face and kissed him, running his left hand down until he found Arthur's hand and held it in a tight grip, feeling the ring press between them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin broke away, pressing their foreheads together. Merlin thought of everything that would follow this night. They would have to prepare, even if they only had a small wedding. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Oh lord, I have to tell my mum.\" Merlin said, thinking how happy she would be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur's face lit up red, to Merlin\u2019s amusement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You know she'll have to know eventually.\" Merlin laughed a bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"No it's not that.\" Arthur coughed awkwardly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Oh my god-\u201d Merlin watched Arthur\u2019s reddening cheeks, \u201cShe already knows!\" Merlin exclaimed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur gave him a small smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Oh- Arthur Pendragon, </span>\n<em>\n<span>you did not</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Merlin said slowly, \u201cYou did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>ask my mum permission to marry me.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Yeah,\" Arthur admitted sheepishly. \"She gave me a long lecture about it too. She said that it wasn't up to her to decide. Then she cried on me and berated me about even thinking you would say no. She boxed my ears and then hugged me.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Oh my god\" Merlin laughed, he held Arthur close and laughed until his cheeks hurt. \"I love you to bits, Arthur Pendragon.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I suppose I love you too, Merlin Emrys.\" Arthur grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You just proposed, you ass.\" Merlin kissed him his words hovering between their lips. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You're stuck with me, like it or not.\" Arthur's never looked so smitten than when he looked up into Merlin's eyes, pressed close on their tiny couch in front of the fire.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I suppose I could deal with that.\u201d</span>\n</p>"
