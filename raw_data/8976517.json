  "notes": "<p>SO THE SEASON FINALE HAPPENED. I am still not over it. That ending watered my crops, cleared my skin, ruined &amp; saved me simultaneously, etc. Anyway, I started writing this before the finale, and I really hope you enjoy it! It will be two parts in total and MA in the second chapter.<br>Be sure to leave a comment and let me know what you think &amp; thanks for reading! :D</p>\n<p>(Also, there is a bit of Russian/Japanese in here for the plot, and alas I am monolingual so if there are any mistakes please feel free to blame Google Translate / let me know!!)</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for all the kind comments on the first chapter!! This one took a lot of rewriting, so I hope that it doesn't come out too patchy. Please let me know what you think :D :D</p>\n<p>Oh, for the record, this chapter is NSFW. If you'd like to skip that part, then skip the section that is cut off by the extra-long separators (~~)! You have been warned!</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cViktor, I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s fingers, which were currently tapping against the counter at a local cafe in St. Petersburg, freeze. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>On the other end of the line there\u2019s a sniffle, then a cough. Then silence. Bare silence. Viktor glances down at his phone and realizes that Yuuri has hung up on him. It takes less than a second for his thoughts to shift into worst-case-scenario mode, downward spiraling into a dark abyss.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything alright?\u201d the barista asks innocently, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>(He forgets the coffee.)</p>\n<p>He runs back to his flat, where he\u2019d stupidly left Yuuri alone in a foreign country he\u2019d never even been in before. He could be dead or hurt or something <em>worse,</em> and yet here Viktor was, getting <em>coffee.</em> He should\u2019ve waited for Yuuri to wake up first, should\u2019ve taken him with him. Definitely, definitely should not have left him alone.</p>\n<p>He swings the door to his flat open and doesn\u2019t bother to check if it shuts behind him, eyes flickering around the foyer immediately for any signs of Yuuri. Eventually, he sees signs of life on the couch in the form of a barely visible tuft of black hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri?\u201d he asks, hurrying to the front of the couch to get a better look.</p>\n<p>He definitely <em>looks</em> dead. His cheeks are pale and his mouth is open as he sleeps, a tiny bit of drool glistening on the corner of his lips. Viktor feels his heart skip a beat as he assesses the situation, notices the way that Yuuri doesn\u2019t react at all to the sound of his own name.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a cold sweat on Viktor\u2019s palms and he wipes them on the front of his jeans, kneeling down in front of the couch and shaking Yuuri\u2019s shoulder gently. He can see his chest rising and falling and he lets out a sigh of relief. He\u2019s alive. Alive. \u201cYuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>The younger man\u2019s eyes blink open slowly, as if the task requires an exorbitant amount of effort. \u201cVik-tor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor wasn\u2019t sure why he was saying his name like that, the syllables oddly detached, but he nods anyway, placing the back of his hand on Yuuri\u2019s forehead. His skin feels hot to the touch\u2014like coal in a stove. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI woke up and everything hurts,\u201d Yuuri explains simply, eyes shutting again as he rolls onto his stomach, causing Viktor to pull his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat hurts?\u201d Viktor insists, because he knows where the nearest hospital is, knows the fastest route and is already preparing a method to carry Yuuri to the nearest taxi and wondering how much money he\u2019d have to pay the driver in order to get him to speed and run every red light to get them there as quickly as possible and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cStomach. Head. Chest. Throat. Everything\u2019s hot, then cold. It all hurts. Do you\u2026 aspirin?\u201d Yuuri\u2019s voice is muffled by the couch pillows.</p>\n<p>Viktor blinks, then takes action. He hurries to his cabinets, sorting through them, and surely, <em>surely</em> he has an aspirin, right? After he has sorted through every drawer, every possible location, he rubs at his forehead, annoyed with himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some,\u201d he offers. \u201cCan you wait here for five minutes? I\u2019ll be as quick as possible. There\u2019s a pharmacy just down the block.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d Yuuri begs, and his voice is higher than usual, desperation dripping from his tone. \u201cI don\u2019t need aspirin, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor wavers, trying to think on his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll get somebody to get some.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pulls out his phone and turns to his contacts. Somebody in St. Petersburg. Yakov? Mila? No, there\u2019s another person he can count on.</p>\n<p>(Well, he can\u2019t <em>count</em> on him, but he can trust him.)</p>\n<p>(Well, he can\u2019t trust him either, but he\u2019ll do.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pinches the bridge of his nose. He <em>really</em> doesn\u2019t have time for this. \u201c<em>Yuri.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The black-haired Yuuri looks up from the couch, his cheeks flushed far, far too red for Viktor\u2019s liking and his bangs falling in front of his eyes in a way that hardly looks comfortable. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTalking to the other Yuri,\u201d Viktor explains, offering him a sympathetic smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hi Yurio,\u201d Yuuri calls, then breaks out into a coughing fit, and Viktor hurries over to the couch, watching him and unsure of how to help. He feels like a fish out of water, awkwardly resting a hand on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder and keeping the phone gripped to his cheek with the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri is staying with you while you two visit St. Petersburg?\u201d Yurio demands, sounding annoyed.</p>\n<p>Viktor rubs the back of his neck. \u201cYes, and I need a favor. Could you bring us some aspirin? And some other medicine, too. I\u2019ll pay you back for whatever you bring. He\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an awkward silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You want me to drop what I\u2019m doing, go to the store, buy medicine, and come bring it to you because Yuuri has a <em>headache?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor stares at Yuuri, his heart hurting as he watches him tug a blanket up to his neck, staring straight up towards the ceiling, his eyes looking glazed over and unfocused. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want,\u201d Viktor answers.</p>\n<p>Another pause. A sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Give me, like, a half hour. You\u2019ll owe me one, Nikiforov.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Yurio coming?\u201d Yuuri asks before coughing again.</p>\n<p>Viktor takes a moment to fully take in Yuuri\u2019s appearance, his initial panic having dampened since Yuuri seemingly isn\u2019t about to die on his couch. His hair is a rat\u2019s nest, the black strands tangled and messy and sticking out in every direction. His glasses have been discarded on the coffee table, and Viktor figures that explains the slightly squinty look in his eyes. Everything about him is just slightly <em>off. </em>Slightly <em>not Yuuri.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Viktor assures him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to bring medicine. I\u2019ll text him and tell him to bring food for you as well. Maybe soup?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want food,\u201d Yuuri whines, shoving his face back into the pillow. \u201cJust thinking about food makes me sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven pork cutlet bowls?\u201d Viktor tries, offering a smile that Yuuri can\u2019t see anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven pork cutlet bowls.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Viktor realizes that Yuuri is truly, truly sick. He\u2019s just glad that there\u2019s no competitions in the immediate future\u2014they\u2019d simply come here after Rostelecom as a sort of training-vacation. They can easily cancel their flight back to Japan and reschedule it if need be. And, judging by the way that Yuuri has already fallen back asleep, it appears as though the need is there.</p>\n<p>Viktor watches him for a moment, noticing just how <em>small</em> he looks as he lays there on the couch, his arms tucked against his chest. Viktor sits down on the side of the couch beside him, rubbing his shoulder and smiling as the younger man instinctively leans into the touch, his head bumping into Viktor\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rings, and Viktor sprints to answer it. \u201cThank you so much for coming,\u201d he praises, accepting the bag of items from him. He pours out the contents on the counter.</p>\n<p>Aspirin, anti-inflammatories, cough drops, <em>everything.</em></p>\n<p>Viktor could kiss Yurio\u2014if he wasn\u2019t fifteen and annoyed by seemingly everything that Viktor did.</p>\n<p>Then, he peeks in another bag that had been pushed off to the side and sees a tub of chocolate peanut butter ice cream. Viktor stares at him, a smile playing on his lips as he realizes. Yuri Plisetsky had willingly, of his own accord and without prompt, bought Yuuri Katsuki ice cream.</p>\n<p>The sight warmed his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yurio demanded, folding his arms across his chest.</p>\n<p>Viktor lets the smile consume his features, rocking back on his heels as they make eye contact, neither of them wavering. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yurio repeats, hands now balling up into small fists.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>thinking</em> something. I just thought he\u2019d like ice cream. It\u2019s not a big deal, alright? You\u2019re paying for that, too, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor places a hand on his shoulder and squeezes, feeling perhaps too much satisfaction from the way Yurio cringes as if he\u2019d been burned. \u201cIt was nice of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever. Where is the sick pig, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor gestures towards the couch and follows Yurio as he approaches the sleeping man, staring wide-eyed. \u201cHe was sleeping when I went to get coffee this morning, then I got a phone call and found him like this,\u201d Viktor explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em>is</em> out of it,\u201d Yurio comments, whistling. \u201cIsn\u2019t your flight tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor waves a hand. \u201cI could move it. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to raid your fridge,\u201d Yurio explains, walking over to the kitchen and making himself at home.</p>\n<p>Viktor just smiles.</p>\n<p>Yurio turns around after a moment, as though feeling Viktor\u2019s eyes on him, and scowls. \u201c<em>What,</em> Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bought Yuuri ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Yuuri wakes up, there\u2019s some sort of ambient noise in the room.</p>\n<p>Everything aches. Every bone in his body. Bones he hadn\u2019t even known existed. The white noise around him batters his eardrums as he sits up, grabbing onto the arm of the couch for support. Suddenly, there\u2019s a hand on his forearm and he allows it to help him up until he\u2019s sitting upright, back pressing into the soft cushions.</p>\n<p>A couch? And whose hand was that?</p>\n<p>Where is he, again?</p>\n<p>He glances up and there are gorgeous blue eyes staring at him.</p>\n<p>(Gorgeous. Blue. They look like crystals. Magical crystals. Like something out of a video game, he thinks. Or sapphires? Or wait, were sapphires a dark blue or a light blue? Dark blue, maybe. Probably. So not sapphires.)</p>\n<p>For a second, he manages to forget about the pain in his head, but then it\u2019s back and the world turns blurry and he just keeps staring at the pair of eyes, sinking back into the couch. \u201cHello,\u201d he greets, and his voice comes out scratchy. He clears his throat, but the effort just ends up turning into another cough. Luckily, though, the figure doesn\u2019t move, remains right where it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice is saying, and there\u2019s still a hand on his arm, he realizes, rubbing it. It feels nice. Soothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he greets again lazily, trying to smile but unsure if the mental effort is reaching his lips. He supposes it works, because suddenly Viktor is smiling back at him, and since when was Viktor so attractive?</p>\n<p>(Oh right\u2014since always. He\u2019d just forgotten.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>He squints at Viktor, realizing he\u2019s not wearing his glasses and that the other man has shifted far away enough so that he\u2019s blurry, now. \u201cWhere are my glasses?\u201d he asks, glancing around.</p>\n<p>His eyes land on a blond figure, who waves at him. \u201cI was starting to think you were dead, Katsuki,\u201d the figure says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my\u2026\u201d Yurio starts, but Viktor shoots him a look and the sentence ends abruptly. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares at him, confused. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you medicine,\u201d he explains, then smirks. \u201cWhile your boyfriend here watched over you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His head burns. Boyfriend? He had a <em>boyfriend?</em> Then he follows Yurio\u2019s gaze, all the way to\u2026 Oh. Viktor. Viktor Nikiforov. His coach. Boyfriend, now? He looks at Viktor for confirmation, but he is already walking away. And why would Viktor be walking away? Why would his boyfriend\u2014or coach?\u2014be walking away?</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor,\u201d he whines, well, he hadn\u2019t intended to whine, but it had sort of come out that way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you some medicine. Do you think you can swallow a pill?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri?\u201d Viktor asks, looking over his shoulder as he digs through the pharmacy bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe nodded,\u201d Yurio explains. \u201cI think he\u2019s still out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of what?\u201d Yuuri asks, rubbing at his temple, which hurts, too, and why does everything hurt? What is happening?</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Yurio responds.</p>\n<p>Then, suddenly, the blue eyes are back and Yuuri leans closer to get a better look. The movement is a bad idea, because suddenly he\u2019s falling forward and his hands dart out to catch himself on the coffee table, nausea swirling in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy, there,\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice says, and arms help him back up.</p>\n<p>Strong, gentle arms. Possibly the strongest arms he\u2019s ever felt in his life. Viktor must work out. A lot. How else would he be so strong? Because he skated, obviously he skated, but that just meant he had really, really strong legs, too. \u201cDo you work out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles at him, Yurio is cackling, but Yuuri doesn\u2019t know why. Viktor holds something out towards him. \u201cOkay, swallow this. Here\u2019s water.\u201d</p>\n<p>(It bothers Yuuri that he didn\u2019t answer his question. Was it a secret?)</p>\n<p>With shaking hands, he takes the pill and manages to swallow it on his second attempt, washing it down with the water before collapsing back on the couch, suddenly freezing cold. Because of the water, probably. The water had been cold, then he\u2019d drank some of it, and now he was cold. He grabs for his blanket and brings it up to his shoulders but it\u2019s not nearly enough. \u201cCold in here,\u201d he mumbles, trying to warm himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a fever,\u201d Viktor tells him, and there\u2019s something to his voice, something that Yuuri could probably decipher if he wasn\u2019t in the process of dying.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold,\u201d Yuuri simply repeats, his eyes falling shut because he doesn\u2019t have the energy to keep them open anymore and he\u2019s just so, <em>so</em> tired. More tired than he thinks he\u2019s ever been in his life.</p>\n<p>And then nothing happens for a minute.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s just the sound of his teeth chattering.</p>\n<p>Then, suddenly, another blanket is draped around his shoulders. He hums and burrows into it, yawning again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our flight soon?\u201d he asks Viktor, though he\u2019s not sure where he is, if he\u2019s even still in the room.</p>\n<p>(He hopes that Viktor is still in the room. Surely he would be, right?)</p>\n<p>He jumps when Viktor\u2019s voice is right beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll move it. Find us another one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother flight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother flight,\u201d Viktor confirms.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve gotta get back to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Where were they going again? And where are they right now? China? No\u2014that\u2019s not right. China had been ages ago. He\u2019d just finished a competition somewhere else, but where had it been?</p>\n<p>\u201cTo Japan?\u201d Viktor finishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Yuuri asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Yurio comments, and Yuuri can see him in the corner of his eyes, making a face at Viktor. \u201cWhat did you <em>do</em> to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Viktor protests, raising his hands. \u201cI think he\u2019s just sleepy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now <em>that</em> Yuuri can agree with. He\u2019s exhausted. The pull of sleep is a force to be reckoned with. The blankets are soft and Viktor\u2019s voice is calming and <em>everything</em> in his body is begging for him to sleep right now. He yawns again before he can help it.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor?\u201d he asks, reaching towards Viktor\u2019s arm before realizing that his depth perception is completely thrown off and Viktor\u2019s arm was actually much farther away than he\u2019d anticipated. How annoying.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Viktor\u2014genius, gorgeous Viktor\u2014moves closer. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tugs on Viktor\u2019s arm and he seems to get the message, sitting closer to him. Yuuri lowers himself so that his head is on Viktor\u2019s arm\u2014no, not his arm. His chest? No. That\u2019s not right, either.</p>\n<p>Oh, he\u2019s on his lap. His head is on his lap and one of Viktor\u2019s hands is on his shoulder and the other is in his hair and why are there strange noises coming from Yurio? What is happening?</p>\n<p>He decides to ask Viktor.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happening,\u201d Viktor assures him.</p>\n<p>His fingers drift through his hair and Yuuri strains to open his eyes to see him in the light but it only lasts a second before he shuts them again, yawning and wondering how Viktor\u2019s lap is more comfortable than any pillow he\u2019d ever experienced before. The cold is gone, now, the warmth from Viktor\u2019s hands and blankets more than enough.</p>\n<p>Yuuri decides to believe him and goes back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor stares at the man currently sleeping with his head on his lap, wondering if Yuuri will disappear if he takes his hands off of him. It feels sort of like a dream, the ephemeral kind that one never wants to wake up from. He ignores Yurio\u2019s many, <em>many </em>comments about the situation and just smiles at Yuuri, wishing he\u2019d feel better but also guiltily enjoying the intimacy.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we keep playing video games now?\u201d Yurio complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pass me my controller,\u201d Viktor informs him, gesturing towards Yuuri.</p>\n<p>Yurio pretends to gag, but passes it anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri wakes up again an hour later. Viktor smiles down at him, but quickly pastes his eyes back to the television, knowing that Yurio will show him no mercy if he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the game for a single instant. Yuuri yawns beneath him, squirming, and Viktor dies in the game, causing Yurio to let out a victorious cheer.</p>\n<p>He figures it\u2019s worth it to reach down and touch Yuuri\u2019s hair, stroking the soft strands with his fingers. Yuuri hums and cuddles into him, wrapping an arm around Viktor\u2019s torso. Viktor wonders if it\u2019s possible to die from love.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour relationship sure has changed since I came to Japan,\u201d Yurio tells him, and Viktor notices he\u2019s talking in Russian\u2014quick Russian.</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks beneath him, turning his head towards Yurio. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChanged how?\u201d Viktor responds in Russian, cupping Yuuri\u2019s cheek comfortingly, successfully quieting him and causing him to nuzzle into the touch. Viktor feels warmth spread throughout his body and looks down at him, part of him never wanting to leave Russia, wanting to stay in his flat with Yuuri forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot touchier,\u201d Yurio informs him. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve found yourself another poodle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor shifts on the couch, Yuuri giggles a bit when he\u2019s jostled by the movement. \u201cWell, he\u2019s sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that Russian?\u201d the man on his lap inquires.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d Yurio comments, ignoring Yuuri. \u201cI noticed it at Rostelecom, too. Not to mention on Instagram. Is there anything you want to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>And, suddenly, Viktor uncovers his meaning. \u201cOh, we\u2019re not\u2026 We haven\u2019t\u2026 No, Yuuri and I aren\u2019t like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard my name,\u201d Yuuri points out, and Viktor knows that he speaks a bit of Russian but either they\u2019re talking too fast or Yuuri is far, far too out of it to comprehend anything other than his name. \u201cAre you talking about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Viktor asks in English, changing the subject. \u201cOr thirsty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri answers, and he cuddles closer into Viktor, pressing his face against\u2014oh. Viktor freezes, a breath catching in his throat. Yuuri was pressed against his abdomen, but his cheek was now resting on a very risky part of his body. Yuuri doesn\u2019t seem to notice the problem because he sighs, and his breath is hot against Viktor\u2019s chest and it only makes everything worse. \u201cYou\u2019re comfy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cComfy?\u201d Viktor repeats slowly.</p>\n<p>Yurio snickers. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Viktor answers in Russian, pushing some of Yuuri\u2019s hair out of his eyes. Then, he switches back to English. \u201cDo you need anything? Are you feeling any better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHead still hurts. A little less, though. But now I\u2019m hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor peels blankets off of Yuuri one at a time and Yuuri sighs in contentment, his lips drifting innocuously against Viktor\u2019s navel through his shirt. Viktor considers the precariousness of the situation and uses all of his power to keep the situation the way that it should be: completely innocent. He\u2019s sick, after all.</p>\n<p>Completely, completely innocent.</p>\n<p>(Which is practically impossible given the current location of Yuuri\u2019s head.)</p>\n<p>(And it\u2019s as though Yurio <em>knows.</em>)</p>\n<p>Viktor needs to get out of this situation as quickly as possible. \u201cYuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>The vibrations from his humming are too much to handle. Viktor takes in a sharp breath. He won\u2019t be able to keep himself under control for much longer in this scenario, and he knows that if Yuuri brushes against something hard and says something, he\u2019ll never hear the end of it. \u201cLet\u2019s walk you to my bed, okay? You can sleep there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t walk,\u201d Yuuri complains.</p>\n<p>Yurio laughs. \u201cOh\u2014this ought to be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor considers his options. Then, he scoops up Yuuri in his arms\u2014one supporting his shoulders and the other under his knees, and lifts him upwards with ease. Yuuri looks shocked initially, but the moment they start walking he wraps his arms around Viktor\u2019s neck, hugging him gently.</p>\n<p>Viktor considers the pros and cons of never setting him down. Of staying in this position for eternity.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice muscles, Viktor. Do you work out?\u201d Yurio comments and Viktor rolls his eyes, carrying Yuuri to the bedroom. \u201cCan\u2019t be easy to carry a weight like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luckily, he said the last part in Russian.</p>\n<p>Viktor fumes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is Yurio saying?\u201d Yuuri asks, blinking up at him through dark lashes, his eyes tired, lines visible beneath them. \u201cI wish you two wouldn\u2019t talk in Russian. I can\u2019t keep up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t anymore,\u201d Viktor promises him, pressing a kiss to his hair. Yuuri smiles at him sleepily.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like if I always talked in Japanese,\u201d Yuuri babbles, and Viktor is fairly certain he doesn\u2019t even know that he\u2019s still talking out loud. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to understand me. \u3042\u3093\u305f\u306f\u50d5\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3001\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u898b\u305f\u4e2d\u3067\u4e00\u756a\u5947\u9e97\u306a\u4eba\u3060.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri just starts giggling.</p>\n<p>Viktor frowns, setting him down on the bed. \u201cUnder or on top of the covers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u4e0b\u306b.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnglish?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnder.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tugs down the covers and helps Yuuri wiggle underneath them. Yuuri smiles when he finally gets comfortable, staring up at Viktor with a look that should be illegal, in Viktor\u2019s opinion, because it\u2019s constricting his lungs and turning his stomach and everything about him is just so ridiculously <em>charming.</em> \u201cViktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for taking care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor feels his heart soar in his chest and he reaches down to touch Yuuri, his fingers drifting across his cheekbone. Yuuri\u2019s eyes close in response to the touch, his jaw slack. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor falters, remembering Yurio in the room next door and biting his lip. \u201cEr\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>When he sees Yuuri\u2019s pouty lower lip extended to full, Viktor-convincing capacity, he knows he doesn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cOkay, just give me one minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio raises an eyebrow at him when he walks into the living room. The blond had started the game again and was currently kicking around Viktor\u2019s unmoving, defenseless character. \u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re going to go take care of him while he sleeps? Just in case he sneezes or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor, you\u2019re whipped.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor rubs the back of his neck, leaning against the wall. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means that if Yuuri asked you to do a little dance for him in nothing but a coconut bra and a hula skirt, you\u2019d do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio just rolls his eyes, turning back to his game. Viktor isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s annoyed at the fact that Viktor <em>would</em> do a dance in a hula skirt for Yuuri or that he still doesn\u2019t quite understand the term \u2018whipped.\u2019 Probably both. \u201cDepends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy shrugs. \u201cDunno, just depends. But go ahead. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Then he grins. \u201cI just won\u2019t let you live it down.\u201d He turns his voice into a horrible, inaccurate impression of Yuuri\u2019s. \u201cOh, Viktor, would you be my coach? Oh, Viktor, would you sleep with me while I\u2019m sick? Would you feed me pork cutlet bowls and stroke my hair? Read me a bedtime story?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor frowns, rocking back on his heels. \u201cThat sounded nothing like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny, it did to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Yurio.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Yuuri smiles when he sees those blue eyes again, instantly reaching out his arms for Viktor, because how\u2019s he supposed to sleep without him? And how\u2019s he supposed to get better if he doesn\u2019t sleep? It\u2019s basic arithmetic. He needs Viktor.</p>\n<p>And then Viktor is laying down beside him and everything is right in the world as he wraps his arms around him, cuddling against Viktor immediately, his presence providing an instant warmth that no amount of blankets could give him. \u201cAre you surprised?\u201d Viktor asks, and Yuuri has no clue what he means.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprised by what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor just laughs. Yuuri doesn\u2019t get the joke, but he laughs, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s hand moves to Viktor\u2019s hair and his fingers run through the strands, the sensation long and endearing, Viktor sighs as he leans into the bed, letting his eyes fall shut. \u201cYour hair is soft,\u201d Yuuri mumbles against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so\u2019s your skin,\u201d Yuuri informs him seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, Viktor. The prettiest person I\u2019ve ever met. \u975e\u5e38\u306b\u304d\u308c\u3044.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes, staring down at the top of Yuuri\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m the prettiest person you\u2019ve ever met?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Yuuri agrees. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Viktor licks his lips. Obviously Yuuri is out of it and doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s saying. Obviously none of this means anything. Viktor tries to detach himself from his words, simply enjoy delirious Yuuri and not take any of his words to heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love me, Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shifts on the bed, wondering if Yuuri will remember any of this the following day. \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Why not be honest?)</p>\n<p>Yuuri grins and kisses his chest through his shirt, the action innocent in every possible way and yet it sends an involuntary shiver down Viktor\u2019s spine. \u201cYuuri, you really ought to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep,\u201d Yuuri complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026And why\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He responds by sneaking a hand up Viktor\u2019s shirt, his fingers splaying across his abdomen. Yuuri\u2019s fingertips are like ice against his warm skin and he jumps a little, making Yuuri giggle uncontrollably. He shifts on the bed, unsure as to whether or not he should move closer to Yuuri or farther away.</p>\n<p>(He knows what he <em>wants</em> to do, but he\u2019s not sure what he <em>should</em> do.)</p>\n<p>(He moves closer.)</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re here,\u201d Yuuri responds, like it\u2019s obvious, like Viktor is the one with the jumbled thoughts right now. \u201cWhy would I sleep if you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you need to feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor regrets his words when Yuuri removes his hand from underneath Viktor\u2019s shirt, tucking it back against his chest and sighing gently, eyes fluttering shut. \u201cGoodnight, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m not going to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Yuuri yawns again, Viktor smiles at his cute, pointless protest. Within a few minutes, his breaths have evened out and his lips are parted. Viktor hugs Yuuri against his chest and pulls his phone out of his pocket, ready to cancel their flight for the following day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Yuuri wakes up, there\u2019s a distinct, Viktor-shaped void beside him. He groans and presses the heels of his hands to his eyelids, head aching. Why does his head hurt so bad? Had he hit it on something? \u201cViktor?\u201d he calls, glancing around the room.</p>\n<p>Where is he, anyway?</p>\n<p>The bed has light blue sheets, like the color of ice, Yuuri thinks, and the walls are bare and boring. There\u2019s a desk in the corner that looks as though it has never been used, and the only item of character is the wardrobe, which has one door ajar and reveals a glimpse of a rack of clothing. The object appears to be stuffed to the brim.</p>\n<p>Yuuri sits up and regrets it immediately. Nausea swirls in his stomach and he groans, leaning forward and placing his hands on his knees. Dead inside. He stands on wobbly legs\u2014hungry, that\u2019s it, he\u2019s hungry\u2014and leans on the wardrobe.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s hot, too. He needs to take this long-sleeved t-shirt off. It\u2019s going to be the death of him. So he pulls it over his chest and sorts through the wardrobe, finding a simple white t-shirt and tugging it on before he has a chance to die of exhaustion or heat.</p>\n<p>Then he fumbles with the doorknob. It won\u2019t open. His hands seem to slip right off of the metal. Some sort of trick? Witchcraft? No\u2014it\u2019s probably locked. Has to be locked. Is there a key? A key, somewhere?</p>\n<p>What if he\u2019d been locked in here on purpose? Who would do that? He knocks on the wood, then waits for a response.</p>\n<p>The door opens. A miracle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t locked,\u201d a voice informs him.</p>\n<p>Not-Viktor stands in front of him.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s his name again? Is it Not-Viktor? No\u2014that\u2019s not a real name, is it? He squints hard, the blond figure blurring in front of him. \u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Not-Viktor raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio!\u201d he realizes suddenly, smiling and leaning against the doorway for support. \u201cAre you\u2026 What is\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns, forgetting what he was going to say. What was happening again? Where had he gotten this t-shirt? Maybe he was still sleeping. That would explain a lot. But why would he be dreaming about Yurio? Normally he dreamt about Viktor.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor went to go get you some muffins. Something about making you feel better. We\u2019ve already got ice cream, so I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, really. Although you <em>do</em> look worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Viktor\u2019 and \u2018went.\u2019 Those are the only two words that Yuuri manages to process. \u201cNot here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio looks sympathetic. It\u2019s an unfamiliar look. \u201cNot here,\u201d he confirms.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Yuuri responds, moving out of the door and past Yurio, looking around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you medicine, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri remembers, but he\u2019d thought it was a dream. In the dream, Yurio had been there, and so had Viktor, and he\u2019d slept on Viktor\u2019s lap and then somebody had carried him to that bed and fallen asleep beside him. Had it been Yurio? No\u2014Yurio wouldn\u2019t sleep with him. Hopefully. That\u2019d be weird.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you sleep with me?\u201d Yuuri asks, yawning and sitting down on the couch, staring at the blank television screen and wondering why nothing is playing, because he wants something to be playing and yet nothing is happening. Shouldn\u2019t it be turning on?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri squints at Not-Viktor again. Wait. Yurio. Not Not-Viktor. \u201cLast night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s three in the afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri just groans and buries his face in the couch. \u201cWhat day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Yuuri a moment to realize that this information has not helped him whatsoever. If anything, he\u2019s more confused. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in Russia?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m talking to you. This is a lost cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio sits on the couch across from him, watching him with a curious expression, like somebody studying something. Yuuri just smiles at him, hoping that he\u2019ll smile back, but he doesn\u2019t. He still looks sort of sympathetic. Why would he be sympathetic? Makes no sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor slept with you, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor <em>Nikiforov?</em>\u201d Yuuri asks, shocked. Because that had been in his dream, so it couldn\u2019t have actually happened. Besides, Viktor Nikiforov was\u2026</p>\n<p>Not-Viktor laughs and Yuuri has no idea why. \u201cNo, the <em>other</em> Viktor,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s smiling, now. Slightly less sympathetic. More amused. Amused by what? The other Viktor? Was the other Viktor funny?</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the other Viktor,\u201d Yuuri repeats, trying to think of any other Viktors that he knows. He can\u2019t think of any, but Yurio is still smiling, so he figures that he must be telling the truth. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want tea or something? Ice cream, maybe?\u201d Yurio offers, and he\u2019s looking down at his fingernails, now. Yuuri wonders what about his fingernails is so interesting. He strains his head to see but he can\u2019t get a good look from over here.</p>\n<p>Ice cream, he thinks. Ice cream would be\u2026 \u201cWhat flavor ice cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChocolate peanut butter. It\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want some,\u201d Yuuri confirms.</p>\n<p>Yurio stands up and leaves. Then, he comes back a minute later with a bowl and a spoon. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins at Yurio, and what\u2019s that English word again? \u201cThanks,\u201d he remembers, grasping the bowl and sitting up to eat it. He digs in immediately and the taste of the chocolate and peanut butter mixture is frankly overwhelming. He wonders if this is what heaven tastes like. Wonders if this is the best thing in the world. Wonders why everyone on Earth isn\u2019t eating peanut butter chocolate ice cream at all times.</p>\n<p>Yurio is smiling at him. It\u2019s an expression he\u2019d seen earlier. A weird smile. One that didn\u2019t suit his face. \u201cGood?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Yuuri answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo tell me about you and Viktor,\u201d Yurio asks, and he\u2019s smiling even bigger now, and his voice doesn\u2019t sound like Yurio\u2019s normal voice, and why is he holding a phone? The phone is pointed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and Viktor?\u201d Yuuri repeats, frowning. \u201cViktor Nikiforov or the other Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio frowns, suddenly. \u201cWho is the other Viktor? There\u2019s another Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri has never been more confused in his life. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond boy waves his hand, dismissing the subject. \u201cNikiforov.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Yuuri answers simply, shutting his eyes and remembering his dream, remembering Viktor\u2019s arms around him, the smell of his cologne. It feels so real and he takes another large scoop of the chocolate peanut butter ice cream into his mouth, lips closing around the cold metal spoon. Tastes like heaven.</p>\n<p>Yurio looks shocked. \u201cYou\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove him,\u201d Yuuri finishes for him, smiling because he can\u2019t help himself. He always smiles when he thinks about Viktor, really. (Nikiforov, not the mysterious other Viktor who he is still trying to remember.) \u201cI named my dog after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour <em>dog?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVicchan,\u201d he informs him happily. \u201cAnd I used to have posters of him all over my room. Every wall. And I started skating competitively because of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio\u2019s jaw has dropped, his mouth forming a small \u2018o\u2019 shape. He\u2019s still holding his phone for some reason, but his arm has gone slack a bit. He stutters for a second, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2026 You named your dog after Viktor? And had posters of him all over your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Yuuri agrees, remembering. \u201cViktor is talented and kind and wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond boy swallows and suddenly he has lowered his phone, shoving it into his jeans pocket. \u201cRight, er\u2026 He\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri has finished his ice cream so he sets the bowl on the table and leans back into the couch, cuddling into the pillows and trying to get a piece of hair out of his face. It\u2019s just one little strand but for some reason he can\u2019t get a grip on it and it\u2019s driving him mad.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a noise coming from the other side of the room and Yuuri jumps, staring at Yurio wide-eyed. \u201cIs somebody here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Viktor, probably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a murderer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any murderers have keys to Viktor\u2019s flat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Viktor\u2019s flat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio doesn\u2019t respond, just rolls his eyes. \u201cAt first, it was kind of funny seeing you like this, but now it\u2019s starting to get annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri frowns, squinting to get a better look at him. \u201cSeeing me like what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, suddenly, Viktor is there. (Nikiforov. Not the other one.) He\u2019s smiling down at Yuuri and Yuuri grins up at him, extending his arms towards him. Viktor hugs him tight and he can\u2019t stop smiling, all of his pain forgotten as he\u2019s held tight. \u201cHi,\u201d he greets dreamily, smiling at him.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u042f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435,\u201d Yurio tells him. Viktor frowns, looking concerned. But why would he be concerned?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you saying?\u201d Yuuri asks, tugging on Viktor\u2019s sleeve, because Viktor has been here for about thirty seconds now and yet he\u2019s still standing and Yuuri is laying down and that just won\u2019t do. If they\u2019re together, why would they be in different positions? That just seemed inefficient.</p>\n<p>Viktor responds in Russian. It\u2019s a jumble of syllables that he can hardly make out. Yuuri hears his name and shuts his eyes, wanting to argue but lacking the stamina. Why wouldn\u2019t Viktor just lay down with him already? Viktor, lovely Viktor.</p>\n<p>Then Yurio pulls out his phone and he\u2019s talking in English again. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to show you later, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Viktor asks, still concerned, rubbing at his temple. His temple looks soft. Yuuri wants to kiss it and tries tugging on Viktor\u2019s sleeve again, and why won\u2019t he <em>move?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWe just had a talk,\u201d Yurio says, grinning devilishly.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s eyes flick between the two Yuri\u2019s for a moment before he glances back at the kitchen counter. \u201cI got you a muffin, Yuuri. Do you want it?\u201d</p>\n<p>A muffin. Blueberry, blueberry, <em>please</em> be blueberry. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlueberry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor Nikiforov is his hero, his idol, his everything. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He devours the muffin in record time.</p>\n<p>Then Viktor is giving him some sort of medicine\u2014a liquid, this time, that\u2019s odd\u2014and he swallows it. It has a bad taste and he sputters, coughing into his elbow and scrunching up his nose. Viktor touches his shoulder, though, and he realizes that they\u2019re sitting together on the couch, now, so he does what he\u2019d been meaning to do before.</p>\n<p>He leans over and kisses Viktor on his temple. Viktor\u2019s cheeks turn red and Yurio is laughing and Yuuri doesn't understand the joke.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more talking in Russian. Viktor defensively wraps an arm around Yuuri\u2019s side, pulling him closer. Yuuri doesn\u2019t complain, just glances between them, wondering what they\u2019re saying. He hears his name a couple of times. Viktor sounds annoyed. Yurio sounds more annoyed, but he always seems to sound that way, so Yuuri isn\u2019t sure if he really is or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop talking like that,\u201d Yuuri complains. \u201cEnglish. Eng-lish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Viktor apologizes, pressing a kiss to his hairline. Yuuri smiles sleepily at him, resting his head against Viktor\u2019s shoulder and leaning back against the couch. \u201cI moved our flight to Friday, by the way. I figured you\u2019ll be better enough by then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Yuuri agrees. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMonday,\u201d Yurio reminds him again, and\u2014oh, he\u2019d already asked that before, hadn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Yuuri tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long has he been awake for?\u201d Viktor asks, and his words are obviously directed at the blond boy, not Yuuri, and he feels slightly annoyed. Why was Viktor asking Yurio questions about Yuuri? Nonsensical.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot long enough to miss you,\u201d Yurio snickers.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pulls away and suddenly there are blue eyes looking down at him and when had those gotten there? \u201cYurio gave me ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor glances down at the coffee table, examining the empty bowl. \u201cHe did, did he? How kind of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut. It.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to be in China for another week?\u201d Yuuri asks, thinking about doing this for another week, clinging to Viktor and sleeping beside him in his dreams and hugging him and having nice talks and ice cream with Yurio. He smiles.</p>\n<p>Viktor has the same sympathetic look Yurio had had, except there\u2019s a few differences. There\u2019s another emotion mixed in with it. Like he\u2019s happy and concerned at the same time. It\u2019s confusing to look at. Yuuri squints to try and figure it out, but it\u2019s a pointless effort. \u201cWe\u2019re in Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, for four more days. We\u2019ll leave Friday morning if you\u2019re well enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like it here,\u201d Yuuri tells him, toying with the hem of his own shirt and wondering when he\u2019d bought this one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that shirt?\u201d Viktor asks, and Yuuri wonders if he can read his thoughts somehow. Given that it\u2019s Viktor Nikiforov, he figures that that is entirely possible. Viktor probably had all sorts of superpowers. Maybe that was how he\u2019d gotten that natural hair color.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor frowns and turns Yuuri around in his arms\u2014Yuuri complies easily, laughing at the feeling of Viktor\u2019s fingers tickling his ribs accidentally\u2014and examines the tag on the back. \u201cThat\u2019s my shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri starts laughing harder, because the idea of him wearing Viktor\u2019s shirt is just ridiculous. \u201cYour shirt?\u201d Then, he remembers getting it from the wardrobe. He sneezes. \u201cOh, it<em> is</em> your shirt. Do you want it back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pulls him back into his arms and kisses him firmly on the part in his hair, his lips lingering and his hands on his sides, making him shiver. He smells great, cologne and shampoo and blueberry muffins and all sorts of wonderful things, and Yuuri can\u2019t quite believe that he\u2019s being held by Viktor Nikiforov right now.</p>\n<p>(He wonders what he did right. Makes a mental effort to figure out what he\u2019d done so that he could do it again so that Viktor does this again in the future, as often as possible.)</p>\n<p>(Maybe it was sneezing? Should he sneeze more often?)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for Yuuri to fall asleep again. He knows Yuuri values his sleep on the same level he values his skating, but Viktor is still not sure he\u2019s ever seen someone sleep this much in his lifetime.</p>\n<p>Yurio pulls out his phone. \u201cI need to show you this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor cringes. \u201cYou video taped him?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond just shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor rolls his eyes but watches the video anyway, horrified. \u201cYurio, he\u2019ll be so embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I upload it?\u201d he asks, and it isn\u2019t like Yurio to ask for permission to do things like that and Viktor smiles internally, knowing that he cares enough about Yuuri to not instantly upload it without his consent. Yurio was growing feelings\u2014Viktor could tell.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Viktor says. \u201cDelete it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Delete</em> it?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor thinks for a moment. He drums his fingers along his legs. \u201cOkay, send it to me, then delete it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s fair for <em>you</em> to blackmail Yuuri but not fair for me to do the same thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to blackmail him,\u201d Viktor explains, eyebrows shooting up towards his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right. You just want to hear him calling you wonderful on an endless loop,\u201d Yurio points out. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit egotistical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls on the couch beside him, one of his arms falling off of the couch and touching the carpet beneath. His face is smushed against the cushions, the thin white t-shirt having ridden up to his stomach and the strip of skin slowly driving Viktor insane. There was something about seeing Yuuri in his clothes, in his flat, that words couldn\u2019t apply to. A feeling of domesticity that makes him warm.</p>\n<p>His phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out and stares at the text\u2014a video\u2014before glancing up at Yurio, who is already walking across the room. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the blond says grudgingly. \u201cI\u2019m not deleting it off of my phone, though. Just so you know. It could be valuable in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment Yuuri wakes up, he sprints out of the bed and into the bathroom, finding the nearest toilet and promptly vomiting. His eyes roll back in his head as he grips the edges of the toilet seat, chest heaving and his heart racing in his chest. There\u2019s sweat on his forehead and his hair is sticking to it and he\u2019s never felt so <em>disgusting.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hand on his back, suddenly, rubbing comforting circles. Yuuri groans and flushes the toilet before falling back and leaning against the nearest wall, his entire body hot and his head pounding. \u201cOw\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor, he realizes. Viktor is there, looking concerned. Why is he concerned? \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>He still feels nauseous. \u201cThe blueberry muffin hurt me,\u201d Yuuri explains, leaning against the bathtub and resting his head on the porcelain. It\u2019s cool to the touch and he huddles farther into it, placing his hands on the surface, too.</p>\n<p>Viktor sighs, picking him up and taking him away from his cold porcelain. Yuuri doesn\u2019t mind, though, because he wraps his arms around Viktor\u2019s shoulder and he smells like cologne, familiar, lovely cologne, and it\u2019s perfect. \u201cViktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes? I\u2019m bringing you back to the bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>As they exit the bathroom, he remembers something. \u201cBrush my teeth,\u201d Yuuri complains, shutting his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor sets him down on his feet and he grips the sink with white knuckles trying to stay balanced. After he has brushed his teeth, Viktor guides him with a hand on the small of his back. \u201cEverything hurts,\u201d he complains, because surely Viktor could make the pain go away. Viktor could do <em>anything.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything,\u201d Viktor laughs gently. \u201cBut if I could make the pain go away, I would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, had he said that out loud?</p>\n<p>Yuuri stops in his tracks, staring Viktor in the eyes with a sobriety that could kill. He wants\u2014no, he <em>needs</em>\u2014Viktor to believe him. \u201cYou <em>can</em> do anything, Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor blinks, surprised. \u201cThanks for your confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything. You\u2019ve won so many medals, and your quadruple flip is like\u2026woah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pauses, trying to gain his balance because all of a sudden the world is spinning. Viktor steadies him. (Of course he does.)</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Viktor says, moving towards the bed.</p>\n<p>Yuuri struggles to get underneath the covers but the moment he does, Viktor is with him again, and it\u2019s like the dreams he\u2019d been having. Viktor sleeping with him. Not in that way, of course, though he wouldn\u2019t mind doing it in <em>that</em> way. In fact, he\u2019d thought about doing just this in <em>that</em> way plenty of times before.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat way?\u201d Viktor repeats, looking surprised and flustered.</p>\n<p>Yuuri can no longer tell what is in his head and what is out loud. \u201cYou know, <em>that </em>way,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cLike, a sexual way. It\u2019s not like that, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Viktor agrees, and is that disappointment in his voice or is Yuuri more tired than he thinks?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d Yuuri explains, because Viktor must not get it. \u201cI\u2019d like to be more, but you\u2019re <em>Viktor,</em> so we\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s hand, which had been rubbing his back, pauses its motions. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor shifts, and suddenly he\u2019s not holding Yuuri as close anymore, and Yuuri is confused, chasing after him selfishly. \u201cYuuri, you\u2019re not making any sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri frowns. Had he done something wrong? Why wasn\u2019t Viktor holding him anymore? He rubs at his arms, trying to replace the warmth. \u201cI\u2019m making plenty of sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnglish?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Oops. \u201cI\u2019m making plenty of sense,\u201d he repeats in English.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean we can\u2019t because I\u2019m Viktor?\u201d Viktor asks, and it\u2019s a bit weird to hear him speaking in the third person like that. Well, it was first person, because he\u2019d used \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d But then he\u2019d used his own name. Which was third person. How confusing.</p>\n<p>Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.</p>\n<p>It was a pretty name. Sounded funny on his tongue. Just like Yuuri\u2019s name sounded funny on Viktor\u2019s tongue. He liked it, though. A good sort of funny.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri?\u201d Viktor asks, snapping him into focus.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds funny,\u201d Yuuri mumbles, grinning and reaching up to touch Viktor\u2019s cheek, brushing a strand of hair out of his eyes.</p>\n<p>Viktor frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t answer, captivated by his hair. It\u2019s soft and silver, and was it really natural? He had never asked. He\u2019s about to ask when Viktor reaches up and grips his wrist, lacing their fingers. They\u2019re holding hands, now. \u201cWe\u2019re holding hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Viktor agrees, smiling. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do that more often,\u201d Yuuri complains. \u201cFeels like we never do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. But now will you talk to me, Yuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks. He tries to decode Viktor\u2019s words, but it\u2019s pointless. The Russian beside him is making <em>no</em> sense. Zero. Zip. Nada. \u201cWe\u2019re already talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor just smiles again. What the heck? Was he missing a joke?</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to explain what you mean when you say that we can\u2019t be more than friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Yuuri begins, \u201cI mean, meta\u2026meta-something. What\u2019s the word?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMetaphorically,\u201d Viktor provides.</p>\n<p>\u201cMetaphorically,\u201d he pronounces slowly, \u201cwe could be more than friends. You know.\u201d He glances down at their joint hands, swallowing. \u201cPartners. But you\u2019re Viktor, and you\u2019ve won like, five billion medals and I still can\u2019t land a quad salchow half the time. And you\u2019re attractive\u2014like, really attractive\u2014and so it wouldn\u2019t really work out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor looks shocked.</p>\n<p>Yuuri offers him a smile. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay!\u201d he insists, wanting to see Viktor smile again. \u201cMore than okay. I like this.\u201d To prove his point he nudges Viktor\u2019s chin with his head, pressing a kiss against his exposed collarbone. Viktor shivers. Why\u2019d he do that? Was he cold?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re attractive?\u201d Viktor asks, and his voice is low, and it\u2019s not comforting and cute like it had been a minute ago, now it\u2019s serious. Almost angry. Not angry. But almost. Upset, maybe?</p>\n<p>Yuuri purses his lips, thinking about it. He\u2019d used to think that he was unattractive, but he had more self confidence lately. Probably thanks to Viktor. A lot of nice things in his life were thanks to Viktor. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Not as attractive as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>(<em>That</em> he is sure of.)</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are so, <em>so</em> wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour attractiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy what-ness?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor touches his hair. It feels lovely. For whatever reason, it reminds him of sunflowers. Sunflowers in tiny brown pots lined up along a windowsill. A soft sunset. He hears humming then realizes it\u2019s coming from him. That\u2019s odd.</p>\n<p>\u201cAttractiveness,\u201d Viktor repeats slowly, drawing out every syllable. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks. Those two words coming from Viktor\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t seem to fit together right. Didn\u2019t seem applicable. \u201cI just threw up in your bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill gorgeous,\u201d Viktor assures him, and his fingers leave Yuuri\u2019s hair to drift along his jawbone instead, the touches light and delicate. Yuuri leans closer to him for more contact and Viktor chuckles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m attractive?\u201d Yuuri asks, wide-eyed. Surely Viktor\u2019s words didn\u2019t mean what he thought they did. After all, he\u2019d been misinterpreting a lot of things recently. Perhaps this was just another in a long line.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d Viktor murmurs, and his fingers are still on Yuuri\u2019s face and Yuuri shuts his eyes.</p>\n<p>When his hand pulls away, Yuuri chases the touch, leaning closer towards Viktor. \u201cDon\u2019t stop doing that,\u201d he pleads.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor starts again and this time one hand is in Yuuri\u2019s hair and the other is on his cheek. Yuuri doesn\u2019t know where to focus his attention so he just bundles the fabric of Viktor\u2019s shirt in his hands, mumbling incoherent syllables and letting his eyes fall shut. \u201cI love you,\u201d he tells him, because it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor responds, and he kisses his head and Yuuri wonders if being sick for the rest of his life might be worth it if this is what he gets.</p>\n<p>When Viktor rolls out of bed in the morning, Yurio is, unsurprisingly, gone. He smiles when he sees that he had taken the remainder of the ice cream with him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri has shoved all of the blankets off of him in the middle of the night and is laying on his stomach in Viktor\u2019s t-shirt and the same pajama pants from the night before. His head is resting on the sheets, not the pillow, and Viktor wonders how he could have possibly been comfortable sleeping like that.</p>\n<p>Viktor takes a shower, and as he shuts off the water he can hear Yuuri\u2019s voice. He frowns, trying to listen as he dries his hair, slipping on a pair of track pants before exiting the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you,\u201d Yuuri is saying, voice still muffled by the sheets as he presses a phone to his ear. \u201cI\u2019m in Viktor\u2019s apartment. Yeah. No\u2014he\u2019s been taking care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles, leaning against the doorway and watching as Yuuri lifts himself up by his palms, leaning back against the bed frame, still unaware of Viktor\u2019s presence. His words are coherent, now, finely pronounced, less foggy than they\u2019d been the day before. Viktor guiltily forces down the twinge of disappointment that rises in his thoughts. It was <em>definitely </em>immoral to be upset that Yuuri was feeling better. Definitely, definitely immoral.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d Yuuri is insisting, probably to his mother. \u201cJust a cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, he sneezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I swear!\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor laughs and Yuuri\u2019s head darts around, staring at him. \u201cViktor!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri says some quick words in Japanese before hanging up the phone and tossing it on the bed beside him. Viktor sits down beside him, brushing some hair out of his eyes. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Yuuri answers, and there\u2019s a flicker of surprise at Viktor\u2019s touch, but then it\u2019s gone. \u201cEverything hurts less. My head is still pounding, sort of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant more medicine?\u201d Viktor offers, already standing and approaching the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine. \u2018M just tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor figures he has seen the last of delirious, sick Yuuri. He almost feels like he should hold a funeral. \u201cWe\u2019ll spend the day inside,\u201d he promises. \u201cWe could play board games\u2014I\u2019ve got Monopoly\u2014or watch a movie! We could invite Yurio back over, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri laughs. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d <em>love</em> to. Honestly, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s my biggest fan. But I guess we\u2019ve known that for a while now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe brought you ice cream,\u201d Viktor points out. \u201cThat has to count for something.\u201d</p>\n<p>His grin fades, the corners of his mouth turning downward. \u201cIce cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pauses, hand coming up to rub the back of his neck. \u201cYou\u2026 You don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember ice cream?\u201d Yuuri asks, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. When did we have ice cream? Yesterday? It\u2019s all a bit blurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>And this is just peachy, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>The universe managed to let him and Yuuri confess their attraction for each other only to have Yuuri forget it the next morning. Peachy. Wonderful. Fantastic. About a thousand other adjectives.</p>\n<p>(Typical.)</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Viktor says, and he smiles but he knows it isn\u2019t reaching his eyes, know it won\u2019t appear genuine.</p>\n<p>Yuuri can tell. \u201cDid anything else happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>So, so much. \u201cNo. You were out of it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>The black haired man ducks his head, cheeks flushing. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t say anything embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor can feel his phone in his pocket, remembers the video. \u201cNope. Nothing of the sort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri reaches out to grab his hand and squeezes it. \u201cGood. Thanks for taking care of me, Viktor. You\u2019re a great friend. I bet it wasn\u2019t easy to rearrange the flight.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hadn\u2019t been, so Viktor decides to take the credit, smiling back. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, Yuuri appears to notice something. He glances around the room, eyebrows drawing together in concentration. His eyes catch on the wardrobe. \u201cAnd this is\u2026 your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor confirms, rocking back on his heels and watching Yuuri\u2019s expression carefully. It appears as though he\u2019s still a little rough around the edges judging by how long it had taken him to come to that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we were sleeping? In your bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh.</em> This may be hard to explain. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026 I don\u2019t remember packing this shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor stumbles to come up with an answer. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That shirt is\u2026 That would be mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing your shirt,\u201d Yuuri repeats slowly, touching the fabric with his fingers, as if it\u2019s made out of some magical substance other than polyester.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sort of\u2026 took it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks horrified, now. His eyes are large and he\u2019s still touching the end of the t-shirt, as if unsure if it\u2019s truly there or not. Then he looks at the bed, the crumpled up sheets and the place where Viktor had been. His eyebrows draw together and a small wrinkle forms between them, one that Viktor has seen many times before when Yuuri is thinking particularly hard about something.</p>\n<p>Viktor scrambles to come up with a way to remedy the situation. \u201cUm, do you want to take a shower? Might make you feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks more than happy to hurry into the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Then, a few minutes later: \u201cViktor, I forgot to bring clothes in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave some in the bedroom then shut the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to clear his mind of images of Yuuri standing naked in his bedroom, but it\u2019s a futile effort. Instead, he focuses on looking around the foyer and figuring out what he should do. Should he get out the board games? Should he offer to take him sight-seeing? No, he probably wouldn\u2019t want to go sight-seeing\u2014he\u2019d just recovered from being sick.</p>\n<p>He tugs his phone out of his pocket and selects Yurio\u2019s contact, leaning back against the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor? Is everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles. \u201cConcerned for Yuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. I\u2019m n\u2014 I was just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s feeling better, I just wanted to know if you\u2019d want to come over and hang out with us. We\u2019re going to, uh\u2026\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cDo something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo something?\u201d Yurio repeats.</p>\n<p>Viktor shrugs to himself, eyeing the bedroom door and wondering what was taking Yuuri so long. \u201cMaybe Monopoly?\u201d Then, he remembers. \u201cOr Cluedo?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the break in Yurio\u2019s resolve. Like the sound of glass shattering. \u201cCluedo? Well, I guess I\u2019m free for the day. Might as well make sure you two don\u2019t set your flat on fire or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor grins. \u201cGreat! See you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor, you\u2019re not supposed to say great when I\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Viktor hangs up.</p>\n<p>The bedroom door swings open and Yuuri stands there, rubbing at his forehead, looking more presentable than he had the day before. He\u2019s wearing a long-sleeved blue t-shirt and jeans that are far too tight for Viktor to possibly be expected to keep his eyes off of them. His hair is combed back, glasses perched on his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio is coming?\u201d Yuuri asks, sitting down at the kitchen counter beside Viktor, still palming his forehead. \u201cMy head is aching. Maybe I will take you up on that medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor nods and retrieves a pill and a glass of water. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s coming. He loves Cluedo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCluedo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri\u2014tell me you\u2019ve played Cluedo before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri falters. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be your coach anymore,\u201d Viktor says regretfully, handing Yuuri the pill and then dramatically collapsing on the counter, burying his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri complains, shoving his shoulder. \u201cViktor, get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, you\u2019ve broken me. I cannot believe you haven\u2019t played Cluedo. It\u2019s a <em>classic.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you can introduce me,\u201d Yuuri promises, smiling before breaking out into a coughing fit, covering it with his elbow. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor stares at him, concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s smile is sad and tugs at Viktor\u2019s heartstrings. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Viktor offers, and he guides Yuuri to the couch where he sits down beside him. It feels different, though, this time. They both sit upright, their thighs touching but the rest of it completely platonic. He remembers when Yuuri had instantly fallen asleep on him and wishes he\u2019d do that again, wishes he would remember.</p>\n<p>(It feels unfair. Unfair in the most selfish of ways.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate being sick,\u201d Yuuri complains, glancing around. \u201cHave you got any tissues?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor fetches a box shaped like Makkachin. Yuuri smiles at it, pretending to pet the head. \u201cYou\u2019re already feeling better, though,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery second I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m not practicing,\u201d Yuuri responds. \u201cMaybe tomorrow we can go to the rink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Viktor repeats, shaking his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re off the ice until we get back to Japan. Maybe longer, depending on how you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks crushed. \u201cViktor, the next competition is the Grand Prix. I can\u2019t afford to waste any practice time. Nobody else is going to. Besides, I already feel better than I did before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody else is sick,\u201d Viktor informs him. \u201cAnd practice can wait. Your health is more important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t look satisfied by this answer. Instead, he scoots away from Viktor towards the end of the couch, leaning against the arm of it and grabbing at the television remote. It does something to Viktor\u2014seeing Yuuri so at home like this in his tiny apartment. His shoes and socks are off and his feet are on the couch and it would all be <em>perfect</em> if he didn\u2019t look so annoyed right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour health is more important,\u201d Viktor tells him again, crawling across the couch to be closer to Yuuri, placing a hand on his shoulder. Yuuri looks at him wide-eyed, lips parting. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll still win the Grand Prix.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you know?\u201d Yuuri asks quietly, still pressing buttons on the remote, though neither of them are looking at the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just do.\u201d He kisses Yuuri\u2019s hair, and it\u2019s something he hadn\u2019t done before yesterday but he wants it to be a permanent thing so badly so he does it, hoping that it\u2019ll trigger some sort of remembrance in Yuuri.</p>\n<p>Instead, Yuuri just looks at him, smiling. He\u2019ll take it. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, there\u2019s a knock on the door. An aggressive one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kick your sorry butts in Cluedo,\u201d Yurio informs them as he marches inside, sitting himself down at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Yuri,\u201d Yuuri greets, waving from the couch where he\u2019s clutching the tissue box, his nose red and glasses forgotten on the coffee table in front of him.</p>\n<p>Yurio stares at Viktor, then Yuuri. \u201cI see you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, you can form words,\u201d Yurio points out, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, could I not form words yesterday?\u201d Yuuri asks, blushing.</p>\n<p>Yurio stands up and moves over to Viktor\u2019s pantry, searching through it for the board game. \u201cYou thought we were in China. And you forgot my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were in China?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor wants to strangle Yurio because Yuuri looks embarrassed now, his eyes downcast toward the couch as he wrings out his fingers. \u201cIt was pretty funny,\u201d Viktor informs him, trying to make light of the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like it,\u201d Yuuri responds, and there\u2019s a bit of a smile there, now. Viktor would pat himself on the back if he wasn\u2019t surrounded by two people who would judge him immensely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI found it!\u201d Yurio announces as he holds up Cluedo. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this. And Nikiforov,\u201d he points a threatening finger at Viktor. \u201cIf you cheat, <em>I will know.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cheated!\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smirks. \u201cJust because I won doesn\u2019t automatically mean that I cheated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does!\u201d Yurio protests. \u201cI always win at Cluedo. Always. We\u2019re playing again. Best two out of three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri has grown accustomed to the rules of the game, now. His chair is awfully close to Viktor\u2019s\u2014Viktor had slowly but surely moved closer towards him over the course of the first round\u2014and when they both reach for a piece at the same time, he feels himself blushing.</p>\n<p>Yurio complains loudly. Something about them being gross, probably.</p>\n<p>Viktor is blushing back. Yuuri grins.</p>\n<p>After two more rounds, Yuuri has one once, then Viktor again. Yurio is fuming. The others laugh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d he declares. \u201cYou two are conspiring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConspiring?\u201d Yuuri asks, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might conspire to make an Instagram post about how the king of Cluedo isn\u2019t the king after all,\u201d Viktor threatens playfully.</p>\n<p>Yurio growls. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep playing. Just you wait, Nikiforov. Just. You. Wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>~~</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat movie do you want to watch?\u201d Viktor asks later that afternoon, after Yurio had left, outraged at his inability to win a single round of Cluedo.</p>\n<p>Yuuri yawns and sits down on the couch, eyeing the large bowl of buttered popcorn that Viktor had set on the coffee table. Instinctively, he leans forward and devours a handful. \u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he responds.</p>\n<p>As he grabs another handful, he sees Viktor watching him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Yuuri asks defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Viktor answers, looking amused.</p>\n<p>Suddenly self-conscious, Yuuri backs away from the popcorn and leans back into the couch. \u201cWhat movies do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly Russian ones,\u201d he shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny ones with subtitles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shrugs as Viktor sits down beside him on the couch, scooping up some popcorn. \u201cYou could translate it for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles at him, reaching out and brushing a strand of hair away from his eyes. \u201cNot a bad idea. That could be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Yuuri asks, a little too breathlessly for his own liking. Viktor pulls his hand back to his side and suddenly Yuuri is all too aware of the space in between them. He wants nothing more than to pull Viktor against his side, to place his head on his shoulder and watch whatever it is he wants to put on\u2014Yuuri really could care less.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Hang on, I\u2019ll pick something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor begins to explain the plot of the mystery drama, which Yuuri, if he\u2019s being honest, doesn\u2019t pay attention to because the way that Viktor leans closer to him as he translates the dialogue is intoxicating. His voice is low, as if to not cover the sounds coming from the television, and occasionally his leg brushes against Yuuri\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat actor is that?\u201d Yuuri asks, because the tension in the air is palpable and, really, he doesn\u2019t care what actor it is, nor does he know anything about Russian movies.</p>\n<p>Viktor responds with a name he\u2019s never heard of. Yuuri simply nods, taking eating more popcorn. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Viktor adds, and Yuuri freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. Just curious, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s attractive?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri coughs, almost choking on his popcorn. He stares at Viktor wide-eyed, and the other man\u2019s blue eyes are calm and serene, as if it was a normal thing to say. And, to be fair, it was a normal thing for Viktor to say. After all, he was <em>Viktor.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Yuuri responds, voice squeaky. He\u2019ll blame it on the sickness.</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles at him before casually picking up a piece of popcorn and tossing it into his mouth with an accuracy that makes Yuuri think that it should be an Olympic sport. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rubs the back of his neck, searching for the right words. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not <em>ugly.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He realizes that there has been a ton of dialogue that they\u2019ve both missed, and the story has progressed to another scene. Yuuri has no clue what is happening on the television in front of them. Judging by the way Viktor\u2019s gaze is focused entirely on him, he figures Viktor doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, either.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you <em>do</em> find him attractive?\u201d Viktor asks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shifts uncomfortably on the couch, glueing his eyes to the television. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no, not really. Like I said, he\u2019s not ugly, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri wonders if this is really happening or if this is some horrible, sick-induced nightmare. He sneezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cBless you,\u201d Viktor says, smiling.</p>\n<p>An actor on the television is yelling about something and Yuuri wonders if he keeps staring long enough, looks as invested as possible in the plot, if Viktor will forget the question he\u2019d just asked. But the weight of his gaze is like the sky and Yuuri is Atlas, trapped endlessly underneath it with no choice but to hold it up.</p>\n<p>And then, suddenly, there\u2019s a cold hand on his wrist and Yuuri shivers, eyes slowly drifting over to Viktor. He\u2019s watching him with a look akin to objective observation, his eyebrows raised slightly and his hair messier than usual. \u201cYuuri?\u201d he asks, and his voice isn\u2019t pushy, yet somehow that just makes it worse, makes Yuuri panic even more.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Yes\u2019 as in that\u2019s your answer to the initial question or \u2018yes\u2019 as in what was I about to ask you?\u201d Viktor asks, his fingers on Yuuri\u2019s wrist moving down so that their fingertips are touching, now, and the feeling is electric and Yuuri is tempted to grab at his hand to feel the sparks but he\u2019s frozen, trapped by the other man\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>And it didn\u2019t even seem like he was <em>trying.</em></p>\n<p>(Did Viktor know what sort of effect he had on him? Surely he did. He <em>must.</em>)</p>\n<p>Yuuri stumbles to find an answer. \u201cUm, both?\u201d</p>\n<p>(What had happened yesterday? Did it have anything to do with why Viktor was doing this here, now?)</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles at that and leans closer to him, gaze drifting down to their hands. Their faces are only inches apart, now, and the noise and view of the television have been blurred to the point where they\u2019ve forgotten about its existence altogether. The couch is soft and Yuuri sinks into it, a blanket caught around his waist falling down to the floor.</p>\n<p>Then Viktor\u2019s free hand is on his knee and Yuuri shivers again, and though he wants to blame it due to the sickness and lack of a blanket he knows it\u2019s Viktor, and Viktor seems to know it too, knows that all of Yuuri\u2019s attention is completely locked onto him, that he\u2019s hyperaware of every movement, every breath. Everything about him is captivating, every inch of his skin, every word that leaves his lips. Yuuri wonders if it\u2019s tiring to be so intriguing at all times, wonder if it truly is as effortless as he makes it seem.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a breath and it\u2019s hot against his cheek, causing Yuuri to let his eyes fall shut, let his head lean forward. His entire body is aching for contact, arousal already affecting him, his hands balling up into unconscious fists, the tension from his back escaping and moving into his white knuckles instead.</p>\n<p>A phone rings.</p>\n<p>(It takes Yuuri a full ten seconds to comprehend the obnoxious noise.)</p>\n<p>(Viktor still hasn\u2019t moved. His hand is still on Yuuri\u2019s knee.)</p>\n<p>(Yuuri scrambles off of the couch.)</p>\n<p>He grabs his phone from the coffee table, heart thumping in his chest. \u201cOh, it\u2019s Phichit,\u201d he explains, wondering if he should answer it or not answer it all and <em>oh god,</em> what had been about to happen? Viktor was his coach. Surely they couldn\u2019t\u2026</p>\n<p>Yet he wanted to.</p>\n<p>He presses the button and sits back down on the coach, making sure to leave far more room between them than had previously been there. With shaking hands, he pulls the blanket back up onto his lap as Viktor pauses the movie. \u201cHi, Phichit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit tells him a story about some awkward experience he\u2019d had while grocery shopping before asking what Yuuri is up to and\u2014<em>oh, you\u2019re still in Russia? You\u2019re sick? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?</em></p>\n<p>Viktor is scrolling through his own phone, though Yuuri can tell that he\u2019s listening in on the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re with Viktor right now? In his flat?\u201d Phichit is asking.</p>\n<p>Yuuri smiles and puts the phone on speaker. \u201cSay hi, Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Phichit,\u201d he offers, smiling at Yuuri. Yuuri feels himself blushing and ducks his head despite himself, because the other man hadn\u2019t even done anything and yet the room feels as though it\u2019s growing smaller every second, as if the walls are closing in on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Viktor,\u201d Phichit says. \u201cAlright, well I\u2019ll leave you two to, er, <em>it</em>. Call me when you\u2019re back in Japan, Yuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Yuuri promises before saying goodbye and hanging up.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an awkward silence after the phone is hung up.</p>\n<p>Yuuri wants more than anything to go back to where they\u2019d been before, to feel Viktor\u2019s skin on his own, to hear the way his voice had gone breathy when he\u2019d leaned in closer. Yet the sensation was already starting to feel like a distant, ephemeral memory. Like something that would never happen again.</p>\n<p>(He figures it probably won\u2019t.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feeling tired?\u201d Viktor asks, and he\u2019s brushing another strand of hair out of Yuuri\u2019s eyes and he hasn\u2019t done that before these last few days but now it seems as though he\u2019s doing it every other second and the action is driving Yuuri <em>insane. </em>It\u2019s innocent and endearing and domestic.</p>\n<p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyebrows draw together in concern and it\u2019s all just too much. \u201cAnd your other symptoms? Any better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy head and throat still hurt, but everything else is a bit better. I\u2019m sort of thirsty, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Viktor is standing up and walking to the kitchen. \u201cWater? Or something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWater is fine,\u201d Yuuri answers. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. And I suppose you should go to sleep. You need as much rest as you can get.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to sleep. At least, mentally. Physically, he\u2019s more exhausted than he\u2019ll let on, his entire body begging him to rest. The day had gone by quickly and he hadn\u2019t had time to catch up. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Yuuri lays down on the couch and tugs the blanket over his body, adjusting himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri\u2014no. You\u2019re taking my bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the couch, honestly,\u201d Yuuri offers, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>(He remembers waking up in Viktor\u2019s bed that morning. Viktor had been in the shower, and the sheets on the entire bed had been ruffled, but had Viktor slept on the couch? What had happened the night before, really?)</p>\n<p>Viktor rolls his eyes. \u201cI am not fighting with you on this. Get up or I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri feels his cheeks warming as he stands up, running a hand through his hair. He doesn\u2019t miss the way that Viktor watches the motion, captivating his attention for an instant. \u201cWhere will you sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe couch,\u201d Viktor explains, and he\u2019s steering Yuuri towards the bedroom. \u201cIf you need anything, just come get me. Doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Yuuri has an idea. An insane one. The type of idea that is absolutely terrible when you look back on it later, but in that instant it feels like the right thing to do. One of those. \u201cYou could sleep on the bed with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a novel idea, they\u2019d slept together plenty of times before. Hotel rooms, back at the hot springs, practically everywhere. Yet this feels different.</p>\n<p>Viktor blinks. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Besides, it\u2019s a big bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>(In all fairness, it<em> is</em> a big bed, but it\u2019s not <em>that</em> big.)</p>\n<p>Yuuri grabs sweatpants and a t-shirt and heads into the bathroom to the change. When he leaves, he sees Viktor in the bed, the blankets pulled up just above his navel, already dressed in a too-big black shirt. He knows that Viktor normally sleeps shirtless and notes the change, half disappointed and half relieved.</p>\n<p>(As he crawls into bed beside him, the disappointed half wins out.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you want to sleep beside me even though I\u2019m sick? I <em>really</em> don\u2019t mind the couch,\u201d Yuuri offers one more time.</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles and reaches towards Yuuri, and he wonders if he\u2019s going to touch his hair again because he\u2019s not sure his heart could take it, but instead he just removes his black rimmed glasses and folds them, placing them on the nightstand beside the bed. Somehow, the action is even worse and Yuuri stares at the now-blurry figure in front of him, lips parted and fingers tapping nervously on his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll infect me,\u201d Viktor teases. \u201cJust don\u2019t cough on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pretends to cough on him and Viktor yelps, huddling away from him. \u201cThere, now you\u2019re infected and we don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles before leaning over and turning off the lamp. Suddenly, Yuuri\u2019s heart is thumping even harder in his chest because every movement makes him feel as though he\u2019s about to bump into Viktor, every breath makes him feel more self-conscious about his own actions. Which is ridiculous, because they\u2019re just in the same bed, after all\u2014it\u2019s not that dramatic of a situation.</p>\n<p>Yet he rolls around more than he usually does to get comfortable, tries hugging the pillow and tries shoving the blankets down to his waist, tries everything, and yet all he can focus on is the man beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t get comfortable?\u201d Viktor asks and Yuuri cringes, knowing how stupid he must seem right now.</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be\u2014come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shifts closer to Viktor, unsure of exactly what the other man wants him to do. Then, there\u2019s an arm wrapped around his torso, tugging him closer until his back is pressed firmly against Viktor\u2019s chest. Viktor\u2019s other hand drifts up to his hair and the movements are slow and languid and comforting and perfect.</p>\n<p>A warmth spreads through his body as he shuts his eyes, sighing and relaxing underneath Viktor\u2019s touch. His fingernails scrape Yuuri\u2019s scalp and the action is so innocent yet so infatuating that Yuuri can feel his blood rushing south and he\u2019s glad he\u2019s not on the other side of this cuddling scenario.</p>\n<p>Without meaning to he lets out a breathy sigh and Viktor just hums in response, his fingers magical and his presence so lovely that Yuuri isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019ll ever sleep alone after this, isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d ever managed to sleep alone in the first place. He remembers, eons ago, when Viktor had asked to sleep with him in his room and he\u2019d turned him down out of sheer terror. If only he\u2019d <em>known.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou have nice hair,\u201d Viktor tells him, his voice sultry and smooth in Yuuri\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Yuuri informs him, and it takes all of his willpower not to moan when Viktor\u2019s fingers flicker across the sensitive skin behind his ears and then move back into his hair, gently tussling the strands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Not as nice as yours,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s soft.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s body shifts back against Viktor against his will, his back gaining more pressure against Viktor\u2019s torso, their shoulders bumping and Viktor letting out a breathy laugh. He wishes he could see Viktor\u2019s face in that moment, wonders what his eyes look like, what his skin looks like in the dark lighting. But he\u2019s too horrified to turn around, horrified that Viktor will stop touching him or that the spell will be broken.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s arm around his side tightens its grip and his hips are pressed against Yuuri\u2019s own and Yuuri isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s imagining the hardness currently pressed against his lower back, but he prays that he isn\u2019t, and judging by the way Viktor\u2019s breath catches in his throat when Yuuri wriggles against him to get more comfortable he figures that his senses are telling him the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor mumbles, and the syllable sounds more like a prayer than a name.</p>\n<p>Yuuri realizes that he hasn\u2019t breathed in the past minute. He takes in a deep breath and releases it, annoyed when Viktor\u2019s fingers on his hair still. \u201cDon\u2019t stop doing that,\u201d he pleads, and for some reason the situation is vaguely familiar but he doesn\u2019t know why, doesn\u2019t know how he remembers something like this happening. It\u2019s a sense of deja vu and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s due to his muddled mind or due to the arm currently wrapped around him right now, clouding his thoughts.</p>\n<p>(Most likely it\u2019s the way Viktor\u2019s fingers resume their movements, the way that Yuuri\u2019s form fits perfectly against his, the way that the only sounds in the room are their own and that they can both pretend they\u2019re the only people on the Earth, that they don\u2019t have anywhere to go the following day or the following week or the following year.)</p>\n<p>And he needs to ask Viktor something, <em>has to,</em> but he can\u2019t remember what or if there even was a question in the first place. Then, Viktor stills his fingers again\u2014damn it all\u2014and uses the free hand to turn Yuuri around by his shoulders so that they\u2019re facing each other.</p>\n<p>The only lighting in the room comes in from a window to the left with the blinds cracked open slightly, and Yuuri can hardly see any of Viktor\u2019s features in the darkness but that makes it easier, makes him more comfortable, in a way. Because he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d be able to handle Viktor\u2019s look right now\u2014the dilated pupils, the parted pink lips, the crystal blue eyes. He can hardly handle the thought of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>(That sounds familiar, too, but Yuuri pushes those manic thoughts to the back of his mind because some weird realistic dream he\u2019d probably had five years ago is definitely <em>not </em>what he needs to be thinking about right now.)</p>\n<p>(But there\u2019s something in Viktor\u2019s tone, a hint of desperation. As though he\u2019s trying to remind Yuuri of something.)</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how to respond, just reaches up a hand to cup Viktor\u2019s cheek, his fingers brushing against his sharp jaw bone. Viktor leans into the touch and Yuuri smiles shyly, wondering if by some miracle he has the same effect on Viktor that Viktor has on him. Then his fingers drift up to Viktor\u2019s hair and he mimics his movements from earlier, removing a strand from where it had fallen in front of his eyes.</p>\n<p>Yuuri leans closer and suddenly their foreheads bump, lips merely an inch apart, and he can feel Viktor\u2019s hot breath on his skin, the sensation inviting. \u201cViktor?\u201d he asks, and he tries to carry an implicit meaning in the name though it\u2019s difficult when he doesn\u2019t even fully understand what he\u2019s asking.</p>\n<p>(Viktor does. Viktor always does.)</p>\n<p>He kisses him. Somebody kisses somebody. Yuuri doesn\u2019t know who starts it. Doesn\u2019t know how it starts.</p>\n<p>(But it does.)</p>\n<p>But Viktor\u2019s lips are on his and he tastes like mint chocolate and his mouth is hot and <em>addictive</em> and Yuuri can\u2019t get enough, couldn\u2019t possibly get closer if he tried, he continues to grip Viktor\u2019s cheek with one hand and brings the other to his hip to anchor himself so that he doesn\u2019t fall backwards, so that he can keep up this awkward position and maintain as much contact as possible.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s lips part underneath his and suddenly his tongue is in his mouth, causing Yuuri to release a moan that doesn\u2019t even sound human, and Viktor just kisses him harder. Eventually, though, Yuuri needs to breathe so he pulls away, his breaths coming out in embarrassingly quick pants and his entire face flushed.</p>\n<p>Before he can dwell too long on his own self-consciousness, Viktor is kissing him again, this time slower, less rough, one of his hands on the small of Yuuri\u2019s back and the other still in his hair, doing those same movements that are driving him absolutely mad. And though he\u2019d dreamed of this experience before, nothing\u2014<em>nothing</em>\u2014could compare to the real thing. Nothing could prepare him for the way that Viktor\u2019s body would move beside his, for the way that his lips would taste.</p>\n<p>Viktor pulls away, then. \u201cYuuri,\u201d he breathes, and his hands move to the bottom of Yuuri\u2019s shirt and lift up the fabric, placing his hands on his torso experimentally. Yuuri shivers under his touch and feels his eyes roll back as Viktor continues his exploration, lifting the shirt up and over his head and tossing it off of the bed.</p>\n<p>He leans down and places his lips on his upper chest, kissing his way down to his nipple and circling it delicately, placing his hand on the other side and his fingers are so cold and his lips so warm that the contradiction makes Yuuri buck his hips towards Viktor unashamedly, letting out a quiet gasp.</p>\n<p>Viktor laughs\u2014<em>laughs</em>\u2014and sucks on his nipple, gently scraping the skin with his teeth before moving down even lower towards his navel, exploring and kissing every inch of skin on the route. His hands have made their way into the waistband of Yuuri\u2019s sweatpants, fingers grazing along his hips on top of his boxer briefs.</p>\n<p>As he starts to tug down the sweatpants, Yuuri can\u2019t help but notice that the situation is starting to get very, very uneven. He kisses Viktor as he gets to work on his shirt, lifting it up halfway before being sidetracked by the newly exposed, smooth skin. His stomach is flat and muscular and tempting but Yuuri continues his work, pulling his lips away just long enough to tug the fabric up and over Viktor\u2019s body and throwing it off of the bed.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pauses, squinting in the darkness to try and get a good look at him but it\u2019s a futile attempt, so instead he just touches his pectorals, testing. Viktor has paused, as though allowing Yuuri time to think everything through, and Yuuri leans closer, mimicking Viktor\u2019s actions from earlier by kissing his chest, circling his nipple. He smiles when Viktor gasps at the action, his grip on Yuuri tightening a nominal\u2014but noticeable\u2014amount.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His words trail off when Yuuri lowers his hand to Viktor\u2019s own sweatpants, hand moving straight to the firmness between his legs, grazing across it with his fingers. Viktor arches into his hand, a breathy, whiny noise escaping his lips, and Yuuri gapes as he realizes he\u2019d just made Viktor Nikiforov make that noise. He had. Genuinely. Just now.</p>\n<p>Viktor Nikiforov.</p>\n<p>(The most decorated male figure skate currently alive.)</p>\n<p>The situation hits Yuuri like a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor is begging\u2014<em>begging?</em>\u2014and tugging down Yuuri\u2019s sweatpants, palming him and\u2014oh god, no wonder Viktor had made that noise.</p>\n<p>Yuuri has never felt anything like it. He can feel the coolness of Viktor\u2019s hand even through his boxer briefs and he arches up without meaning to, even more aggressively than Viktor had, a moan escaping his lips as he chases Viktor\u2019s hand, eyes slamming shut as he needs more friction, needs it more than air, water.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d Yuuri starts, pausing to swallow for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor looks at him, his exploring hands stilling on his sides, holding Yuuri still against him. \u201cWe can do whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. If you don\u2019t want anything, just tell me to stop, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods, not trusting himself to speak because all he wants is more friction, wants Viktor\u2019s body against his, wants to hear him say his name in that breathy voice again. Then, something occurs to him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to get sick now? We just\u2026\u201d He searches for a phrase that\u2019s sexier than \u2018exchanged body fluids.\u2019</p>\n<p>Viktor chuckles, a low sound that causes Yuuri\u2019s stomach to turn. \u201cDo you really think I care if I get sick right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yuuri starts, shaking his head. \u201cWhat if\u2026 I don\u2019t want\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Yuuri\u2014I want you to worry about what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks at him, swallowing thickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I make a suggestion? Would you want me to do something about this?\u201d Viktor palms him through his boxer briefs again and it takes all of his willpower not to cry out, but he does arch into his hand and duck his head into Viktor\u2019s shoulder, breaths already coming quicker, his muscles weak.</p>\n<p>Instinctively, he reaches down a hand to touch himself, but Viktor grabs his wrist before he can, kissing the corner of his mouth. \u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri answers immediately, because he <em>needs</em> Viktor to do something, anything.</p>\n<p>Viktor tugs down his boxer briefs and tugs down the sheets in his way until Yuuri is fully exposed to him, his body still pressed tightly against his own. Viktor makes his way downward, kissing across his chest and down to his navel. \u201cViktor, what are you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s vision is blurry when Viktor places a kiss on the head of his penis, a hand wrapping around the base of it. He whimpers, though he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s in his head or out loud, and his body presses back into the sheets as he turns onto his back, Viktor following him and straddling his legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Viktor asks, and Yuuri can feel his breath against his cock and it\u2019s too much, far, far too much for him to handle. Everything is the exact opposite of okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he repeats, taking in a shaky breath. \u201cPlease, please, please, <em>Viktor</em>.\u201d He\u2019s not sure he can manage any other words, not sure he remembers how to pronounce anything else.</p>\n<p>Viktor lowers his mouth onto him again and Yuuri moves one hand to the back of his head, his fingers weaving through silver hair. Viktor\u2019s tongue does one long stroke up his length and Yuuri wonders if this is what heaven feels like, wonders if he should get sick every day for the rest of his life if this is the treatment he\u2019ll receive.</p>\n<p>Yuuri can feel himself babbling in Japanese but he can\u2019t bring himself to care, and Viktor just smiles up at him, looking more attractive than Yuuri has ever seen him. \u201cGorgeous, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor tells him and places a kiss to the head again, causing Yuuri to buck his hips involuntarily. It\u2019s too gentle, too gentle\u2014Yuuri needs more. He tries to tell Viktor, but he\u2019s not sure what language his words come out in, not sure if any words come out at all.</p>\n<p>He starts a slow, steady rhythm that quickly has Yuuri gasping, using all of his energy to keep his hips lowered on the bed. His free hand tangles in the sheets, knuckles white as he grips the fabric. Sparks fly behind his eyes and he keeps them shut tight, not trusting himself to open them. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d he starts, but his words trail off as Viktor takes him into his mouth again.</p>\n<p>When he comes, Viktor helps him ride it out, increasing his pace and sucking harder than before, cheeks hollowing and Yuuri can\u2019t help but cry out, practically about to tear out the bedsheets beneath his hand. Then, Viktor falls on the bed beside him, panting just as hard and\u2014<em>oh.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cViktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was no way. <em>Impossible.</em></p>\n<p>(Viktor Nikiforov. The world\u2019s most decorated male figure skater.)</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Did you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor blushes. Hard. Harder than Yuuri has ever seen him blush before. It\u2019s adorable and endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Viktor admits and he ducks his head into the sheets and it\u2019s so cute that Yuuri has to lean over and kiss him hard on his lips, their foreheads knocking together more forcefully than he\u2019d intended but they just laugh it off. \u201cIt was just as good for me as it was for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares at him, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s arguable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor mutters something in Russian, the syllables barely audible, and kisses his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Yuuri asks, tracing random shapes on his shoulder with his fingers. He sees Viktor\u2019s head turn to watch the movement, as though in a trance.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri isn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cViktor\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Viktor hums, hugging Yuuri against his chest and touching the hairs on the back of his neck. \u201cYou really ought to sleep, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s more tired than ever, his eyelids already trying to fall down without his permission. His entire form is lethargic, sinking into the sheets and a yawn escaping his lips. \u201cHow am I supposed to sleep <em>now?</em>\u201d he asks, half joking and half serious, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I sing you a lullaby?\u201d Viktor jokes.</p>\n<p>Yuuri bumps him on the shoulder, mock offended.</p>\n<p>Viktor yawns, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to go clean up a bit, I\u2019ll be back. Do you need anything? More medicine or some water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks. If you\u2019re not careful I\u2019ll get used to you taking care of me like this,\u201d Yuuri responds. Viktor moves away from him and out of the bed and he feels his absence like a nipping sensation against his skin, the reaction instant.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be okay with that, I think,\u201d Viktor teases back, and Yuuri can catch a glimpse of his smile in the darkness before he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s eyelids are heavy when he first wakes, his nose brushing against soft, black hair that smells of shampoo. He turns on the bed, yawning as he finally forces his eyes open, finally getting a glimpse of the man he\u2019s currently cuddling.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s lips are parted, his arms tucked in front of him and his knees brought up to his chest. The blankets fall just underneath his collarbone, revealing soft, pale skin. Viktor leans closer and places a kiss to where his neck meets his shoulder, sucking lightly on the spot. He knows Yuuri needs his sleep, but it\u2019s all too tempting, and he\u2019s a weak, <em>weak </em>man when it comes to Yuuri Katsuki.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s eyes flutter open as he strains his neck to get a look at Viktor, staring up at him through impossibly dark eyelashes.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s voice is muffled by his neck, and the skin is so soft and Yuuri\u2019s body against his already has him half-hard, which is <em>completely</em> inappropriate given he\u2019s sick and probably tired and needs as much rest as he can get. But then he remembers what had happened the night before\u2014he\u2019d gotten off by just giving Yuuri a blowjob, which was insane, albeit slightly embarrassing\u2014and a tingle runs down his spine. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri sits up and looks scared, his hand on his throat and his eyes large. The blankets fall down to his hips and Viktor glances down, disappointed to see that at some point, Yuuri had put his boxers briefs back on. Then, scolding himself for getting distracted, he looks at Yuuri\u2019s eyes again, trying to determine the source of the fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Viktor asks, sitting up. \u201cYour throat? It hurts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. He bites his lower lip and shakes his head, worried.</p>\n<p>Viktor tries to remain calm. \u201cYou lost your voice?\u201d</p>\n<p>A nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses, then shakes his head. Yuuri makes a gesture with his hand, placing it flat in the air and wiggling it back in forth to indicate it hurts a little. Viktor winces and places his hand on his cheek, stroking it. The other man offers a small smile, lowering his hand from his own throat and trying to talk again. A small noise comes out, as though his vocal cords are protesting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might make it worse,\u201d Viktor informs him, and Yuuri shrugs. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll find something for it. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri squeezes his hand before he stands up and it\u2019s weird, having one-sided conversations like this. But it\u2019s frustrating more than anything to have to watch him go through pain like this, unable to help. Helplessness isn\u2019t something Viktor is used to.</p>\n<p>He grabs some medicine and brings it back to the bedroom. Yuuri swallows it without protest. Then Viktor leans back against the bedrest with an arm around his waist, watching him carefully. Yuuri stares ahead, his eyes sparkling as though he\u2019s thinking about something. Viktor is about to ask what he\u2019s contemplating when he remembers just how cruel that would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes your head still hurt?\u201d he asks instead.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head, offering a sad smile. A sad smile that makes Viktor hug him closer to him, wonder if there\u2019s anything else he can possibly do. Then, Yuuri wriggles out of his grasp and moves over to the desk, searching for something. He holds up a pen and notebook, eyebrows shooting up as he silently asks for permission.</p>\n<p>Viktor pats the area on the bed beside him and Yuuri sits back down, the bed sinking a little bit. He places the little plastic cap between his teeth and Viktor stares unashamedly\u2014well, maybe with a bit of shame\u2014at the sight of his pink tongue peeking out between his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(He has never wanted to be a pen cap before. But now\u2026)</p>\n<p>Yuuri scribbles something, eyebrows drawing together as he focuses, and then displays the paper to Viktor. It\u2019s a small picture of an ice cream bowl, the drawing surprisingly detailed, and Viktor smiles, squeezing his forearm with his hand. Obviously Yuuri could\u2019ve just written the words, but the fact that he had doodled instead fills Viktor with an odd sense of pride that he can\u2019t quite narrow down.</p>\n<p>Yurio had taken the rest of the chocolate peanut butter, but luckily Viktor had anticipated this moment and bought more yesterday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ll go get some.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri draws a heart on the paper.</p>\n<p>(Viktor almost passes out.)</p>\n<p>(He considers hanging the page on his wall. Considers submitting it to a museum. It\u2019s a masterpiece. It\u2019s everything he never knew he needed and more.)</p>\n<p>He kisses Yuuri. Yuuri\u2019s cheeks flush in the most perfect way and he kisses him back, smiling against his lips.</p>\n<p>When he returns with the ice cream, he can hear the shower running, so he sets the bowls down on the nightstand and sits, pulling out his phone to scroll through missed text messages. When Yuuri emerges, his hair is wet and slicked back and he\u2019s wearing a long sleeved maroon t-shirt and jeans. Viktor isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ever looked more attractive, which is a feat in it of itself.</p>\n<p>Yuuri smiles at the sight of the ice cream and digs in immediately, mouth opening to say thanks before he quickly remembers his voice is missing. He settles down on the bed beside Viktor, legs crossed and hair still dripping a bit\u2014Viktor finds that he doesn\u2019t mind in the slightest.</p>\n<p>A companionable silence settles between them, but then Yuuri sets down the bowl and grabs the notepad again, scribbling something.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Talk?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Viktor eyes the heart on the paper again, his own heart swelling. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Whatever you want.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuri picks up the bowl again, and Viktor watches, mesmerized, as the silver spoon disappears past his lips. He notices Viktor watching him and playfully bumps him with his shoulder, as though reminding him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Viktor begins, unsure of what to say. \u201cI like your hair like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks surprised, a hand reaching up to touch his wet, slicked back hair. He tries to speak again, but nothing comes out. He grabs at the notebook, pen cap back in his mouth, and Viktor contemplates giving him a monologue about that very sight. Who knew a plastic pen cap could be so intimidating?</p>\n<p>\n<em>I like yours, too.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same as it always is,\u201d Viktor points out.</p>\n<p>Yuuri just turns his head, shy. Oh. He puts the pen to paper again, and this time it\u2019s a doodle of a figure with long hair and a flower crown. He adds skates and a rough sketch of an ice rink in the background, doing a row of tiny adjacent circles to represent an audience.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou liked it long?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods, but then draws another figure, this time just standing, with short hair. He doodles a heart beside it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods again, smiling.</p>\n<p>Viktor takes the pen and attempts to draw Yuuri sitting on the bed, but the picture comes out looking less cute and more horrifying. \u201cI can only do stick figures,\u201d Viktor complains, and Yuuri just laughs breathily, grabbing the pen and drawing a heart beside Viktor\u2019s drawing, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the drawing to you. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you could draw?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri is blushing. <em>I can\u2019t draw that well. Requests?</em></p>\n<p>Viktor sets aside his now-empty ice cream bowl and shifts so that he can have a better view of the notebook in Yuuri\u2019s lap, their shoulders now pressed against each other. \u201cHow about you draw something and I\u2019ll guess what it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods and sets to work, drawing a building with intricate details.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaesetsu?\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins and turns the page. Then there\u2019s an image of a figure skater on the ice, and he adds black hair. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Viktor points out. Yuuri nods, but the drawing is incomplete. He adds a figure next to himself. \u201cAnd me? Are we skating together?\u201d</p>\n<p>When he realizes he\u2019s correct, he leans down and kisses Yuuri, his lips tasting entirely of chocolate. Yuuri sets the notebook to the side and leans back into the bed, slipping off of the headboard and onto the pillow while Viktor kisses him, his head sinking into the soft cushion.</p>\n<p>Viktor tangles his fingers in Yuuri\u2019s wet hair, taking a moment to breathe in the smell of shampoo and soap, and places his other hand on Yuuri\u2019s thigh. Yuuri breathes quicker in response to the touch and Viktor feels Yuuri\u2019s lips open underneath his own, their tongues meeting.</p>\n<p>He lazily strokes Yuuri\u2019s thigh as they make out, Yuuri\u2019s hands tangling in his shirt as he leans upwards to meet him, his eyes half-lidded and the tips of his ears tinted pink. He\u2019s completely silent, and it takes Viktor a while to remember why.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head quickly, kissing him again, as if he needs to. Viktor needs it just as badly, needs it as bad as air, as water, forgetting to breathe as Yuuri\u2019s teeth clash with his own, his own eyes falling shut as he lets out a quiet moan that is quickly swallowed by the other man.</p>\n<p>Viktor squeezes his thigh and Yuuri sighs underneath him, eyes finally falling shut and his dark eyelashes looking beautiful and long against his pale skin. \u201cI hardly ever see you in red,\u201d he tells him, toying with the neck of his t-shirt. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s lips are bruised from kissing and his breaths are still heavy and Viktor isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ever seen a more seductive sight, the other man lying underneath him, his hips making small movements towards Viktor\u2019s hand. He reaches out a hand for the notebook and scrambles to find it. He writes a quick note, turning on his side to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I wish I could talk. This is annoying.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you say?\u201d Viktor asks him, leaning down to kiss his neck so that he can still make contact while Yuuri writes. He runs his teeth along the spot where his neck meets his shoulder, lightly nipping as he goes and then soothing the spots with his tongue. When Yuuri slips his fingers underneath the back of Viktor\u2019s shirt and touches his back he shivers, tilting his head to see what he\u2019d written.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s surprised to see that it\u2019s not words, but another picture instead. There\u2019s a man on skates and then another one watching him. The drawing is rough\u2014Viktor can see several spots where the pen scraped against the paper, and he realizes that that must\u2019ve been whenever he\u2019d nipped at his neck, and smiles\u2014but all of the details were put into the observer\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhich one is you? And which is me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri points to the person on skates and then pokes Viktor in the chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it should be switched,\u201d Viktor informs him. \u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been watching you skate far more than you\u2019ve been watching me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head and draws a box around the image of Viktor. Viktor frowns, watching closely. Yuuri adds little sticks poking out of the top of the box and then cheesy hearts around the image of himself. Then, after a moment, he adds a medal around Viktor\u2019s neck, making the shine of it obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cA television?\u201d Viktor asks, and Yuuri nods. \u201cIt\u2019s you watching me on television?\u201d</p>\n<p>He begins another drawing beside it. This time, it\u2019s obviously him on the ice\u2014he colors in the hair, dark. Viktor is on the sidelines, smiling.</p>\n<p>Viktor kisses him and then picks up the pen. \u201cThere we go. Oh, hang on, I have another idea.\u201d He scribbles a golden medal around Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, trying to match the one that Yuuri had drawn before.</p>\n<p>Yuuri bumps his shoulder playfully, plucking the pen out of his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks better on you than me,\u201d Viktor informs him, kissing his temple. Yuuri rolls his eyes, but he\u2019s smiling, too, despite his attempts to hide it. Then, he starts coughing into his elbow, and when the fit is done he\u2019s lost his breath, rolling onto his back and tugging a fallen blanket onto his lap. He yawns and rubs a hand down his face, as though trying to keep himself awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shrugs, eyes staring up at Viktor, curious. He reaches for the notebook.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Will you stay?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s a sense of familiarity to it. A sense that Viktor knows Yuuri doesn\u2019t feel as he cuddles into his side again. His voice is gone but he\u2019s more expressive than ever, the fabric of his t-shirt soft against Viktor\u2019s still-bare chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They fly back to Japan on Friday.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s parents are fawning over him immediately, asking him about his cold and Russia and how on <em>Earth</em> he\u2019d survived without his mother\u2019s soup to help him through the sickness. Viktor feels a bit out of place among the family discussion and heads to his room, pulling out his phone to check up on the social media accounts he\u2019d ignored for the last several days due to being occupied by a far, far more captivating Yuuri Katsuki.</p>\n<p>Later, he finds himself walking to Yuuri\u2019s room, already missing him after a single hour, and hears him talking to someone. He stands outside the door for a moment, unsure as to whether or not he should come inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was Russia?\u201d Phichit\u2019s voice asks, and Yuuri laughs for whatever reason\u2014maybe something Phichit had done over video chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was good, very pretty,\u201d Yuuri answers, and Viktor can hear the smile in his voice and he\u2019s absolutely <em>adorable </em>and he\u2019s more tempted than ever to walk in and pick him up and take him to his bed and never let him leave again.</p>\n<p>Phichit hums. \u201cI\u2019ll <em>bet</em> it was pretty.\u201d There\u2019s a mocking tone to his voice, a hint of mischief.</p>\n<p>Yuuri laughs harder this time and Viktor has to dampen the jealousy that hits him suddenly, because if he had his way he\u2019d keep Yuuri to himself at all times, preferably in a bed, a large one, and preferably with an appreciable lack of clothes between them. \u201cPhichit\u2026\u201d Yuuri starts, voice trailing off, as though trying to lecture him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t get to hear about it?\u201d Phichit complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Yuuri protests.</p>\n<p>Viktor can practically hear Phichit\u2019s melodramatic eye roll. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Makkachin comes running down the hallway and pounces on Viktor\u2019s lap, two feet on the ground and the other two on his thighs, the dog smiling up at him and wagging his tail. Viktor winces as he hears Yuuri stand up and walk to the doorway. \u201cViktor?\u201d he asks upon spotting him, running a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>Yuuri frowns at him, eyes shifting down to Makkachin as he lowers himself to pet the dog. Viktor rubs the back of his neck, \u201cSorry, I heard you talking to Phichit and I was just about to come back later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can come in,\u201d he insists. Viktor falters, rocking back on his heels. He knows that Phichit and Yuuri often talk over video chat, and he really hadn\u2019t meant to come interrupt. \u201cCome say hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Phichit,\u201d Viktor greets, and he doesn\u2019t know the other skater that well so the dynamic is a bit off-putting but Phichit smiles and waves back at him. After all, Viktor isn\u2019t an awkward person, but he feels as though he\u2019s barged in on something of the upmost importance.</p>\n<p>Phichit eyes Yuuri, who sits back down on his desk chair\u2014and Viktor feels as though there\u2019s an inside joke that he isn\u2019t quite getting and it bothers him far, far more than it should. \u201cSo are you two, like, a thing yet? Officially?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks horrified. His cheeks flush red and he death-stares his phone. \u201c<em>Phichit.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I was going to ask you anyway\u2014does it matter if Viktor is in the room or not?\u201d Phichit asks, grinning.</p>\n<p>Viktor shrugs and sits down on the arm of Yuuri\u2019s desk chair, crossing his legs and leaning one arm on the back of the chair to maintain his balance. \u201cWe\u2019re not a thing yet <em>officially,</em>\u201d Viktor says, because he can tell what Phichit is trying to do\u2014even if Yuuri can\u2019t\u2014and decides to play along.</p>\n<p>Yuuri gapes. Mission accomplished.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 We\u2019re\u2026?\u201d Yuuri fumbles, shaking his head slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you should tell everyone at the Grand Prix!\u201d Phichit suggests. \u201cMaybe kiss in front of the cameras. That\u2019d be <em>so</em> perfect. If you do end up doing that, let me know first and I\u2019ll take a picture for Instagram. Imagine the likes. Oh\u2014imagine the <em>comments.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPhichit!\u201d Yuuri repeats, burying his face in his hands. \u201cOf course we\u2019re not going to kiss in front of the cameras in Barcelona.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d Viktor asks, extending his lower lip in a perfect pout.</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks as though somebody has just punched him in the face. His pupils dilate, jaw dropping. He stutters to find an answer, shaking his head and staring at Viktor in disbelief. \u201cYou want to\u2026 You\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit makes a clicking sound with his lips and teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re disappointing your boyfriend, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend?!\u201d Then, realization seems to hit him like a bag of bricks. \u201cYou two are teaming up on me,\u201d Yuuri complains, staring at Viktor with a desperate look in his eyes. \u201c<em>Not</em> fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery fair,\u201d Phichit teases. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve got to get back to practice\u2014I\u2019ll see you two. And remember, let me know what the plans are for going public. I want to be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri groans in protest. \u201c<em>Bye, </em>Phichit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor looks at Phichit\u2019s image on the phone, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo easy on him, yeah? He\u2019s sort of crazy about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Phichit!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already hung up and Yuuri moves over to his bed, burying his face in the sheets. \u201cThat is <em>so</em> embarrassing,\u201d he complains.</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles and sits on the bed beside him, swinging his legs. \u201cHave you talked to him about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe. A little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2014a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor teases, hugging him from behind and wrapping his arms around his chest.</p>\n<p>Yuuri groans into the sheets. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri turns around in his arms and kisses him firmly on the lips, a hand coming up to tug on the ends of his hair. Viktor smiles and lets Yuuri turn the tables, pushing him against the bed and straddling his legs with his own. \u201cAt least I know how to make you be quiet now,\u201d Yuuri jokes, poking him in the chest.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s eyes are shut in please, his head back against the mattress. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s lips move to his neck and he nips at his collarbone, eliciting a gasp from Viktor. It\u2019s new, taking control like this, but Yuuri figures that everything they\u2019ve done in the last few days has been new. A welcoming sort of new, but new all the same. When his phone goes off across the room, Viktor curses in Russian, leaning back into the mattress with a sigh. \u201cWould you mind getting that for me?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head, a bit dizzy from the kissing, moving off of the visibly annoyed Viktor to cross the room. \u201cIt\u2019s a text from Yurio. Do you want me to open it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor waves a hand in the air, a vague gesture. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just said\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio\u2019s last text to Viktor, which is visible above the new message, was a video. And in the thumbnail was\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Yuuri asks, clicking on the video.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s him. Him on the couch in Viktor\u2019s house, blankets piled on his lap.</p>\n<p>He glances over at Viktor on the bed and the man has gone visibly stiff, sitting up and staring at Yuuri, wide-eyed. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014er\u2026 It\u2019s from a few days ago, when you were sick. Yurio took a video of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The video plays.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cSo tell me about you and Viktor,\u201d Yurio prompts from behind the camera, sounding amused</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMe and Viktor?\u201d Yuuri looks as though he\u2019s about to pass out at any second, sniffing and rubbing at his forehead with one hand. \u201cI love him,\u201d he answers after a minute.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Yurio sounds shocked. \u201cYou\u2026?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cLove him,\u201d Yuuri finishes, louder this time, as though it were ridiculous that Yurio hadn\u2019t understood him the first time. \u201cI named my dog after him.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYour dog?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cVicchan. And I used to have posters of him all over my room. I\u2019d get them for my birthday every year from everyone I knew. I started skating competitively because of him.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou\u2026 You named your dog after Viktor? And had posters of him all over your room?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Yuuri smiles at the camera and hums. \u201cViktor is talented and kind and wonderful,\u201d he adds naturally, looking as though he\u2019s about to keep going when the phone is lowered and the video abruptly ends.</em>\n</p>\n<p>When he looks over at Viktor, the other man looks scared more than anything else, his eyes wide and his hand nervously running through his hair as he sits on the bed, legs crossed and cheeks still flushed from when they\u2019d been kissing just moments ago.</p>\n<p>Yuuri sets the phone down on the desk. \u201cYou told me I didn\u2019t say anything embarrassing while I was sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t embarrassing!\u201d Viktor protests. \u201cYou were delirious and Yurio took it because he thought it\u2019d be funny. I wasn\u2019t even around.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Viktor is kind and talented and wonderful.</em> Yuuri cringes and buries his face in his hands, shaking his head back and forth. Maybe he\u2019ll wake up and this will have just been a dream. He could pretend that Viktor had kissed him a few days before without the prior knowledge that Yuuri had adored him, the knowledge that Yuuri worshipped him, would do whatever he suggested. Of course, he\u2019d probably already known half of that before the video, anyway, but\u2026 \u201cWhat else did I say?\u201d</p>\n<p>There <em>has</em> to be more. He can tell by the look on Viktor\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor falters, standing up and moving closer to Yuuri. Yuuri places a hand on his chest, keeping him an arm\u2019s length away. He doesn\u2019t want to be comforted, doesn\u2019t want Viktor to act as though he\u2019s frail. \u201cI figured you didn\u2019t mean any of it\u2014you were out of it. Completely out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else did I say?\u201d Yuuri repeats, slowly this time, trying to add a sense of gravity to his voice and failing miserably when it cracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of it was nonsense. Nothing important. But then\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor swallows thickly. \u201cYou told me you thought I was attractive. And\u2026 And that you loved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pauses, taking in the information. So that night, the night that they\u2019d slept together\u2026 Viktor had known all of that. All of that and more, probably.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026 You tried to kiss me. And I didn\u2019t let you keep going, but we slept in the same bed. You asked me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dream. Everything clicks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares at him, licking his lips and waiting for something, <em>anything </em>that will allow himself to forgive Viktor. Because despite how upset he is (mainly at himself), all he wants is to fling himself in to Viktor\u2019s arms, to wrap himself in his embrace and to hug him tight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(And that's part of the issue, isn't it? Whenever he\u2019s upset, Viktor comes to him. Viktor is his coping mechanism. So now what does he do?)</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to tell me any of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that you meant any of it until that next night, Yuuri, I swear. I figured there wasn\u2019t any reason to embarrass you by showing you the video.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri feels tears pricking at the corners of his eyes and he\u2019s not mad at Viktor anymore, not really, he\u2019s just mad at himself, mad for being so stupidly in love. Mad because he\u2019d thrown himself at a man who had already known that he was in love with him, a man who probably thought he was pathetic and too-eager. Every time he closes his eyes, the words <em>Viktor is kind and talented and wonderful</em> ring in his head again and it\u2019s painful.</p>\n<p>(How could he have thought that a relationship like this would come so easy? He\u2019d been in love with Viktor for ages, and he thought that he could just kiss him and Viktor would kiss him back and it would all work itself out magically?)</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, please don\u2019t be upset,\u201d Viktor is pleading, and his voice is so easy to listen to, his personality so easy to forgive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you earlier, but please, please forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri bites his lower lip. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m so pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, why would I\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I threw myself at you when I couldn\u2019t stop myself. Because I called you attractive and talked about naming my poodle after you, Viktor. Because I had a poster collection of you. How could I have been so <em>stupid?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor reaches for him again, and this time Yuuri pulls away quicker, backing up against his wardrobe and hunching his shoulders forward, trying to make himself as small as possible. A look of hurt flashes across Viktor\u2019s features and it hurts but Yuuri just keeps sitting there, his hands shaking slightly, his mind clouded with racing thoughts and the remnants of his sickness.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pathetic,\u201d Viktor assures him. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought that, and I never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Yuuri argues. \u201cI\u2019ve practically been in love with you for years, Viktor, before I even met you, and meanwhile you only found out I existed less than a year ago. Don\u2019t you think this relationship is a bit lopsided?\u201d</p>\n<p>And there it is.</p>\n<p>The ball dropping.</p>\n<p>Because Yuuri has loved Viktor for years, <em>years, </em>and to Viktor, Yuuri was probably just another fling. He\u2019d probably move on as soon as Yuuri didn\u2019t win the Grand Prix Final. Or, even if he did, he\u2019d just stick with him until he retired, anyway, and he had already been contemplating retiring after this season\u2026</p>\n<p>Lopsided.</p>\n<p>(Lopsided. The word hangs in the air like a threat.)</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s mouth opens, then closes. He laughs\u2014it\u2019s dry and humorless. \u201cApparently you have\u2026 absolutely no idea how I feel about you. Which is my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you have every idea how <em>I</em> feel about <em>you.</em> Don\u2019t you see?\u201d Yuuri sniffles, rubbing at his forehead with the back of his hand because his head still aches and everything is painful.</p>\n<p>Viktor reaches out an arm and wipes away a tear that strayed onto Yuuri\u2019s cheek. Yuuri doesn\u2019t pull away despite the temptation. \u201cCan I try and tell you, then?\u201d Viktor pleads. \u201cNo matter how embarrassing it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t say anything, just ducks his head and stares at the floor. Then, there are fingers on his chin and his head is being tilted up, his eyes meeting Viktor\u2019s. Realizing that the other man is still waiting for an answer, Yuuri offers a small nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you since the day I met you at the banquet,\u201d Viktor tells him, his voice quiet and meaningful, fingers drifting from his chin to his cheek. \u201cThen your video inspired me, Yuuri, more than anything else ever had. And you\u2019ve changed me as a person in so many ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri wipes desperately at another tear that betrays him by falling down onto his cheek. His knees feel weak and his head still aches but he\u2019s hanging onto Viktor\u2019s words like a life raft, struggling to stay afloat even as the water rises around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Viktor tells him, smiling.</p>\n<p>Yuuri laughs, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s all nice, but I hope you realize that none of that was embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. What if I told you that I started dreaming about you when I first came to Japan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor bites the corner of his lip, eyes drifting up towards the ceiling. \u201cAll the time. I dreamt about everything about you. The way you skate, your eyes, your lips, your laugh, not to mention the sight of you in the costume for Eros\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s eyes grow large. \u201cThe Eros costume?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor shakes his head regretfully, voice lowering to a mumble. \u201cSomeday, I\u2019ll give you a several hour long rant about how you look in that costume.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked it that much,\u201d Yuuri admits, biting his lip unconsciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor mumbles, pressing an innocuous kiss to his cheek, lips lingering there, \u201cyou have no idea what you do to me. <em>Especially</em> in that costume.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri turns his head so that they\u2019re kissing properly, his hand raising to cup Viktor\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou really mean all of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery word,\u201d Viktor assures him, breath hot against his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you dreamed about me,\u201d Yuuri mutters, shaking his head. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me that back then\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor blushes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been good at admitting things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you admitting things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughing, Viktor lifts Yuuri up by his waist, lowering him down onto the bed and straddling his legs with his own, kissing him firmly and peppering kisses on any exposed skin he can find\u2014his face, his neck, his shoulders. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Yuuri tells him, pressing a kiss to his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re okay?\u201d Viktor asks him, a worry in his eyes that Yuuri wants to relieve, a worry that tugs on his heartstrings.</p>\n<p>Yuuri grabs his hand in his own and squeezes his fingers. \u201cDepends on whether or not you give me that monologue about the Eros costume.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor cringes. \u201cYuuri\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never see you embarrassed,\u201d Yuuri teases, lifting his head up to kiss his cheek. \u201cSo I\u2019m ready for the several hour long rant you promised, please. Make it sappy. And don\u2019t leave out any details.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is, unless you don\u2019t want me to forgive you. Which is fine. I\u2019ll just go cry about the video alone in my room,\u201d Yuuri threatens, putting on his best fake pout. Then, his expression turns thoughtful as he bites his lower lip, watching the way that Viktor\u2019s eyes focus on the movement, his tongue darting out to wet his own lips instinctively. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll never get to do to you what I\u2019ve been planning on doing to you ever since we got back to Japan.\u201d</p>\n<p>(He\u2019d never actually had anything planned, but Viktor doesn\u2019t know that.)</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s eyes light up the way Yuuri had hoped, eyebrows drawing together adorably. \u201cWhat do you mean, what you\u2019ve been planning on doing\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri places a finger on his lips and gives him a look.</p>\n<p>Viktor swallows thickly, all signs of his earlier protests gone. \u201cWell, I guess it started when you first put it on\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days later</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks, phone almost falling out of his hands. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s violent coughing on the other end of the line and then he glances down to see that Viktor has already hung up on him. Yuuri gapes at the screen and sprints back down the road towards the hot springs. He had been going for an innocent jog since he couldn't sleep, and why was Viktor even <em>awake </em>at this hour? Was he dying? Surely his family would\u2019ve heard him? Surely somebody was helping him?</p>\n<p>When he makes it to Viktor\u2019s room, he sees him curled up in a tiny ball on the mattress\u2014a position that Yuuri has never,<em> never </em>seen him in before\u2014with Makkachin by his feet, sleeping soundly, undisturbed. \u201cViktor?\u201d Yuuri asks, horrified.</p>\n<p>Viktor doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>He was normally so full of life, and yet here he was, silent.</p>\n<p>Yuuri falls to his knees and shakes his shoulders before feeling for a pulse on his neck. Luckily, there was a steady beat. \u201cViktor? Viktor, wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, after a moment, he shifts. Viktor blinks up at him through cloudy irises and sniffs loudly. \u201cI think you got me sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get medicine\u2014I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Yuuri offers quickly, already turning around on his heels when an arm grabs him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take care of me now,\u201d Viktor teases, and there\u2019s a mischievous glint in his eyes but the image is ruined when he sneezes and then groans in pain, the back of his head pressing into the pillow as he reaches down to grab Makkachin.</p>\n<p>Yuuri smiles sympathetically and brushes some hair out of his face. He looked like a mess. His eyes were rimmed with red and there were already prominent lines underneath them. His black shirt was wrinkled and his lips were parted and chapped.</p>\n<p>(There was nothing quite like seeing one\u2019s idol as a complete mess to boost one\u2019s self confidence.)</p>\n<p>(It humanized him, in a way.)</p>\n<p>\u201cPeanut butter and chocolate ice cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p>"
