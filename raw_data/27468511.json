  "notes": "<p>Please read the tags and if you're not comfortable with reading this kind of a story, or if you think that it might be potentially triggering for you, please just... back out. I triggered myself while writing this and it was Not Fun and I don't want it to happen to any readers.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So this was hella late but there was supposed to be a part with an Abyss Mage due to their theoretical connection between the Abyss Order and Khaenri'ah, and the more I wrote about it the more I hated it. I sat on this chapter for like, a week, before I came to the decision that I hated it waayyyy too much so I simply scrapped it. lmao rip.</p>\n<p>Anyway hope you enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Did it fuck you up? This chapter fucked me up :) </p>\n<p>Sorry I haven't proofread it or anything cos I'll probably start fucking sobbing again, but I'm glad y'all read until the end. Kaeya is king and I want to see him obliterated by angst and anything else. </p>\n<p>Just know, I was crying as I was typing and it's really hard to try and think when you're leaking liquid from your eyes, while trying to not get tears onto your keyboard and trying to not alert your family that your crying. wheezes. </p>\n<p>Anyway, comments and kudos' are nice and they're really encouraging. I might write something a bit more lighthearted soon, but not right now. I still need some recovering time lmao. </p>\n<p>I'll also probably be making a Kaeya animatic at some point, whenever I dig out my motivation from whichever hole it's buried itself in, but I currently have a Liyue Chili one on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP9Ervtp3wM (shameless plug lol)</p>\n<p>To celebrate 1000 comments I decided to release the Abyss Mage part - or the part which I wrote before deciding to trash it for being both out-pf-place as well as unsatisfactory :') So no funeral scene - only the conversation that was set after the the day before the final night :)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Did you know?<br>This fic is actually called \"Untitled document\" in my google drive - I had to go hunting through all my Untitled documents to find this one so I might release a bunch of the unfinished ones for funsies in a collection of fics kinda thing idk.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I still read through all the comments posted on all my fics when I'm in need of that sweet sweet serotonin, so I just wanna know I love every single one of you who've commented on all of my fics &lt;3</p>\n<p>Screaming Crying Dying</p>",
  "text": "<p>It all starts, and ends, with a mistake. Kaeya, usually so lithe on his feet, pushes himself just a little, tiny bit too hard, his legs far too tired to dash that extra moment and when he sees the last Mitachurl\u2019s heavy axe, glowing red with heat, swing down he knows he\u2019s finished.</p>\n<p>It burns his flesh, searing pain bursts his nerves as Kaeya feels the blade tear through his shoulder, hears the cracking of his collarbone, the rip of sinew, his sternum being sliced through and he collapses. It hurts so much, it hurts to breathe, his body so heavy and he gasps for breath, trying to reach for his dropped sword with a barely twitching hand.</p>\n<p>The Mitachurl, satisfied with it\u2019s kill, turns away from Kaeya and slings the axe over its shoulder. It lumbers away as Kaeya slowly fades, staring at the night sky and the single moon.</p>\n<p>A corpse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d his mother says as she cradles him in her lap, \u201cthe three moons, Aria, Sonnet and Canon, how they grieved when they turned on each other. They loved and loved until their love became war, and now all that is left is that corpse up there, watching over us, cold and weeping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder, Kaeya, can she see beyond the borders of our forsaken lands? Does she weep for the blessed souls too?\u201d His mother is thin, everyone in Khaenri\u2019ah is, with how ravaged the lands are, the soil is barren and crops barely ever take. Kaeya looks up at the white moon, the pale light that seems to tint ever so slightly red from the constant smoke and fires, \u201cMama, do the gods <em>really </em>exist?\u201d</p>\n<p>She strokes his hair gently, \u201cnot for us now, not for us that have been left behind, not for those who were born here and managed to leave, never for us, not anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>A land eternally trapped, forsaken by the old gods, far from the sights of the new ones, stuck in a single moment in time, starving, burning, in ruins. Unable to die, unable to live, unable to dream. Kaeya, for one moment, wonders what Khaenri\u2019ah could be called.</p>\n<p>Later, he learns the word.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hell.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His parents bring him to what once was a large hall, a crumbling altar before a stone throne. <em>From an age when we were blessed, </em>his mother once told him with a faraway look, <em>when we would worship and celebrate and prosper. </em></p>\n<p>Kaeya looks at the man seated on the throne, \u201cUncle Dainsleif,\u201d he says. Kaeya doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s his uncle, his hair is too light, but that is what he calls him.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d Dainsleif replies, \u201cwe will be sending you away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice crawls up Kaeya\u2019s stomach, he doesn\u2019t want to, being sent away means leaving everyone behind. Khaenri\u2019ah is a suffering to survive in, but his family, <em>everyone, </em>is here, and this suffering is all he knows. His mother\u2019s slips her hand into his, she looks relieved, \u201cKaeya, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t feel great.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can escape,\u201d she says, her smile makes her look like she\u2019s crying, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be trapped here anymore. You can live a better, happier life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kaeya feels his fingers going numb, \u201cwhat about Papa? And Uncle Dainsleif? And everybody else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dainsleif rises from his seat and moves to stand towering over Kaeya. He places a heavy hand on his head, \u201cKaeya, when you were born, everyone celebrated. The first life was created in this cursed world. You are our hope, when you dream, we dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease Kaeya,\u201d his mother\u2019s grip tightens on his palm, her fingers bony, \u201cthis is for the best. For you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya swallows, and his throat is sandpaper and smoke as usual. <em>I don\u2019t want to go, </em>but instead he says, \u201chow do I leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother cries, deep, chesty wails when he is to leave, she clings to him and caresses his cheeks and sobs out, \u201cstay safe, please, be safe.\u201d His father lays a hand on his shoulders and says, \u201cyou know what you need to do. You know what is to happen. I can only take you so far. As a sinner, I can only remain out there for so long before I get smited by the gods.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dainsleif ruffles his hair and says, \u201cdream well, Kaeya Alberich.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to stay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She shines bright, white and pale, her corpse looks down over the blessed souls, Kaeya learns, but the moon no longer weeps. She hangs, heavy and swollen and longing, but no longer weeping. The clouds are fluffy and soft and high in the sky, nothing like the oppressive smog that crept over Khaenri\u2019ah like a miasma and the rain that comes pouring down is wet and cold and absolutely nothing like the ash flakes that stung at his eyes when they fluttered into his face.</p>\n<p>Kaeya wants to slow down, wants to feel the green, green grass between his toes and crouch down to look at the little worms that crawled from the damp soil, but his father\u2019s hand on his shoulder is tense and heavy.</p>\n<p>They stop at the side of a dirt road and Kaeya\u2019s father ducks down to his height, looks him in the eyes with a tired, relieved smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d he says and wraps his arms around his son. Kaeya knows that his time is up.</p>\n<p>His father was never overly affectionate, his mother was the one who would hug him, kiss his face, pet his hair. Kaeya stands there, frozen, as his father tightens the hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d his father breathes in, out, and then says, \u201cmy boy.<em>\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never going to see him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His father lets go, gives Kaeya one last look and then walks away. Kaeya stares after him as his tall figure melts into the darkness of the woods and then.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Boom. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Lightning.</p>\n<p>Trees burn and burn and then the fire fizzles out in the downpour. Thunder reverberates in Kaeya\u2019s ears as he screams, <em>Papa. </em></p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want this, never wanted this. The rain is cold and stings his skin, the grass pokes at the soles of his feet and his soaked clothes stick to him like a second, heavy skin. There, at the side of the dirt-packed road he stands, in the dark, in the cold, alone. He stands there until his legs ache, stick-still, waiting for the moment the gods realise he, too, is a sinner that\u2019s escaped his prison, deserving to be smited as well, his feet hurt, bare toes going slowly numb, but he stands. Suffering is all he knows, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then a carriage rumbles by, it stops, and a man with red, red fire hair steps out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, boy,\u201d the man says, \u201cWhat are you doing out here in such a storm? Where are your parents?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya knows what he needs to do. He opens his mouth and lets lies spill from his lips like poison seeping from teeth. He says, \u201cI\u2019m waiting. My dad will be back soon. He said he\u2019d come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome with me, boy,\u201d the fire man says, warm and soft, \u201cjust until the storm lets up. After, we can look for your father.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>My father is dead, </em>he wants to say. Kaeya can feel arms around him, the very first and last hug from his father.</p>\n<p>\n<em>My boy. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Face pressed to the soil, Kaeya\u2019s last breaths are pain wheezes as he thinks to himself, <em>ah, I still haven\u2019t finished that report on the attempted Hilichurl invasion, </em>and, <em>I said I\u2019d help Klee teach her wild, wolf friend how to read and write, </em>and then finally, <em>Mama, Papa, Uncle Dansleif\u2026 Were my dreams enough? </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a voice, booming and drawled, it says, <em>the you who has yet to conclude your worldly affairs, Kaeya Alberich, the you who\u2019s grown up in a war-torn, godless land, the you who\u2019s entire life has been a battle, do you wish to make a contract? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d His mother once said, pressing a kiss to his forehead, \u201cour people once danced before the sacrificial altar, we once were able to hear revelations from Celestia, is it not a pity we will never again hear the voice of divinity?\u201d</p>\n<p>The earth itself, slow and patient and ever present, rumbles and shifts.</p>\n<p>Kaeya Alberich walks through the front gates of Mondstadt, gives a tired, jovial greeting to the guards manning the walls, \u201cYou\u2019re back late, Captain Kaeya.\u201d Lawrence says. Kaeya grins, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, the main character is always fashionably late.\u201d And they laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It all ends in seven days.</p>\n<p>Kaeya\u2019s acting odd, Diluc notes, he <em>looks</em> odd with his shirt all the way closed on his chest, he's never done that before. He\u2019d just about finished with patrolling the streets of Mondstadt when there\u2019s a jauntily annoying voice calling out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Darknight Hero~\u201d In a falsetto, Kaeya waggles his hand at him, \u201cTruly a stunning silhouette! I\u2019ll see you you-know-where~\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc knows where. Kaeya\u2019s waiting outside the Angel\u2019s Share, the tavern already shut and locked. Diluc sneers, \u201cSurely the <em>great</em> Captain Kaeya has better things to do than wait outside a closed tavern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you wound me,\u201d Kaeya says and gestures with his left hand, \u201cright here, in the heart. Young Master Diluc will definitely let his cute brother have a drink. After chasing away a camp of Hilichurls, a knight is deserving of some reward, no?\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc scoffs and unlocks the door to the tavern, \u201cdrinking when there\u2019s reports to fill the next day? How conscientious. And, we\u2019re not brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya shrugs and saunters into the building, slouching onto the barstool. He tips his head, \u201cOne Death After Noon,\u201d and Diluc pours him a drink and slides it over the counter and watches the liquid slosh as Kaeya stops it with his left hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is grape juice,\u201d Kaeya blandly says, but still takes a sip. Diluc\u2019s eyes narrow, \u201cThe Hilichurl camp?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya puts the glass down and waves the topic away, \u201cdealt with. You would think after the whole Stormterror incident, they\u2019d back off a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc hums and snatches up Kaeya\u2019s right arm from over the bar, there\u2019s a sound like grinding, cracking, and Kaeya jerks from the movement, a short, aborted yelp escaping his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Kaeya breathes out and Diluc notices that his arm is trembling, \u201cand I thought I hid it so well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right handed,\u201d Diluc states, \u201cand yet you only used your left to pick up and gesture with.\u201d Kaeya gives a one-shouldered shrug and Diluc lets go of the man\u2019s arm, \u201cI would\u2019ve thought a Captain of the Knights at your skill would be able to clear out a Hilichurl Camp without injury.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya chuckles, \u201cis that a compliment I hear?\u201d and Diluc pretends to turn around to take stock of his spirits lining the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too much a bother to the Deaconess, Barbatos knows that she has to deal with enough from having to heal all those incompetents in the Knights of Favonius.\u201d There\u2019s a short silence before Diluc hears Kaeya swallow the rest of his grape juice and put down the glass with a <em>clink</em> and the scrape of the wooden stool against the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m having to go on a bit of a journey in a week\u2019s time, I\u2019ll be dropping by everyday until then,\u201d Kaeya says, there\u2019s the rustle of cloth and the thud of boots and the door to the tavern swings open, \u201cmy dear brother will definitely make time to work a simple week at this delightful tavern, right? I\u2019ll even restrain from going to the Cat\u2019s Tail for you, my devotion is truly astounding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc turns sharply on his heel, \u201cwe\u2019re not bro-!\u201d</p>\n<p>The door to Angel\u2019s Share closes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Klee is as adorable as ever, eyes wide and red and reminding of kinder times, she pulls the wolf boy along as she bounces towards Kaeya, \u201cMr Kaeya! You said you\u2019d teach Razor how to read!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya laughs and pats her head, \u201cindeed I did. Shall we go to the library to get some books. The day is nice so why don\u2019t we go outside to learn? I\u2019m sure Razor would hate to be cooped up in a musty old library for the entire day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee agrees and when Kaeya sends her to rampage through the shelves with a quick, \u201cdon\u2019t burn any of the books or Lisa will be mad, pick what you like but not something too hard, maybe something with pictures?\u201d and then after Klee returns with an armful of picture books, they\u2019re well on their way to sit at the feet of Barbatos\u2019 statue.</p>\n<p>Razor is a quick learner, he doesn\u2019t quite understand the need for extra filler words, but at least he\u2019s trying. When Klee\u2019s stomach lets out a tremendous growl, Kaeya sends her down to the Good Hunter with a bag of Mora to choose whatever she wants for lunch. He figures he might as well spoil her just a little bit more.</p>\n<p>Kaeya turns to Razor and says, \u201cthere\u2019s something I need you to do for me, in a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Razor hears him out.</p>\n<p>Klee returns with a small baggy full of Mondsdadt Hash Browns and Fisherman\u2019s Toast and a container with six skewers. \u201cI got everyone\u2019s favourites!\u201d and plops down next to them. As she munches down on her toast she looks up at Kaeya with painfully wide, innocent eyes and says, \u201cMr Kaeya, did you hurt your hand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya grimaces and shoves a Fruity Skewer into his mouth, \u201cjust a little. Nothing to worry your head about.\u201d Klee nods and accepts the answer at face value and Kaeya\u2019s heart aches, \u201cmake sure you go and visit Miss Barbara then, she always makes hurts go away!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya pats her head and when they\u2019re done with their food, Kaeya pulls a handkerchief from his jacket and wipes at her mouth to brush off crumbs and then they go back to trying to teach Razor to read.</p>\n<p>The sun begins to set and paints the sky a brilliant orange and soft lavender and Kaeya decides it\u2019s time to go back. He watches fondly as Klee cheerfully walks in front of him and decides to speak up.</p>\n<p>\u201cKlee,\u201d he says, and she turns on her heel and beams at him, \u201cin six days I\u2019ll be going on a journey. Really, really far away, for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a quick movement he sweeps Klee off her feet and rests her small, fragile body in the crook of his left arm. His chest hurts, <em>was I this small when Papa hugge-</em> and he bonks their foreheads together, \u201cthat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee giggles quietly and reaches up to pat Kaeya\u2019s head, \u201cremember to go and see Miss Barbara before you go. Miss Lisa always says that you need to be in tip-top health when you go on an adventure!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya closes his eyes and smiles in agreement and feels like he needs to vomit.</p>\n<p>Razor stays silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next few days Kaeya spends working on his paperwork. He fills in his backlog of reports, he assigns a successor to his position of Captain, and he completes his resignation form.</p>\n<p>It only sinks in how final it all is when he signs his name with shaky penmanship.</p>\n<p>His right arm still trembles, there\u2019s barely any strength left in the limb, his nerves had gotten severed and the temporary replacement doesn\u2019t have the delicacy for his usual smooth gestures. Straightening out his arm, he pushes himself to his feet and wanders through the Headquarters\u2019 hallways and into Jean\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>She looks tired, and so is Kaeya, but Kaeya still declares with as much energy he can muster, \u201cOur dearest Acting-Grandmaster must be delighted to hear that I\u2019ve finished writing all my reports and paperpushing, you can send someone to grab it from my desk whenever you\u2019re ready. I am a free man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d she says and <em>yikes,</em> that sure is a flat tone, \u201cget out of my office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya gets out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two days left.</p>\n<p>The Angel\u2019s Share Tavern is rowdy and loud, some of the men there already halfway to blackout drunk, and behind the bar, Diluc stands. To Kaeya\u2019s pleasure, he\u2019s been present every single night, they snipe and sneer at each other, the poison they spit at each other so comfortable it begins to taste sweet on their tongues and then the night ends and Diluc goes on his patrols and Kaeya returns to the Knights\u2019 dormitories.</p>\n<p>He stands in his bathroom, fresh out of a shower and just.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stares.</p>\n<p>Tan skin split from right shoulder diagonally down, down, through his chest, ending near his left hip. <em>Almost completely sliced through,</em> he thinks hysterically, <em>I\u2019m a hair from being bisected.</em> Amber glows bright and ethereal from underneath his flesh, filling the gap the Mitachurl\u2019s axe had torn through him like he was clay. He closes his eyes.</p>\n<p><em>The child who lives and breathes and writhes beneath the pressure of war, </em>the voice whispers as molten rock pours into his body, glowing orange geo floods him and crystallises the cryo sitting in his veins, it glows and burns and then the amber solidifies around his organs and holds his every cell in suspension, <em>with the blood fed to earth, the contract is sealed. Seven days and seven nights to put all worldly affairs in order before the Son of Sinners, Kaeya Alberich will, with grace, perish on his own terms. </em></p>\n<p>He rests his head on the mirror and the amber pulses with light, in time with his stolen heartbeat. There\u2019s no reason for him to see Barbara, she can\u2019t bring the dead back to life and he\u2019s already a dead man walking.</p>\n<p>Two days left and he thinks about all the people of Mondstadt he\u2019s going to be leaving behind and he <em>doesn\u2019t want to go. </em></p>\n<p>The amber patchwork crumbles and grinds into fine dust as he shifts his arm. It\u2019s not his choice.</p>\n<p>The second last day Kaeya spends packing up. He\u2019s folding his clothes and putting them into bags to make it easier for whoever has to clean up after he\u2019s gone, he separates small trinkets and things he\u2019s collected over the years while living in Mondstadt and marks the cardboard boxes with names regarding what goes to who.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Jean, dried cecilias and his favourite fountain pen, it\u2019s an old thing that Master Crepus had given Kaeya, back when Kaeya was still trying to learn how to read the common language rather than the ancient runic language that was scrawled over the ruined buildings of Khaenri\u2019ah and the old stone tablets that told tales of Celestia and gods and happier times for his people.</p>\n<p>To Lisa, a simple notebook, filled to the brim with the old language, telling the many myths and tales his mother had told to him as they sat in a forsaken land, staring at the corpse hanging high in the sky. Kaeya\u2019s sure that she\u2019d enjoy the challenge of trying to understand the \u2018dead\u2019 language, but just in case, he\u2019d included a key at the very back of the notebook, translating the alphabet.</p>\n<p>To Barbara, he gives materials he\u2019d heard had medicinal properties to mitigate heads and relieve fatigue, for both her and Jean.</p>\n<p>To Amber, he gives souvenirs he\u2019d bought while travelling through other Archon\u2019s lands on Knightly duties, small things like a charm or a scented candle. Things that would allow Amber to travel as freely as the wind without ever leaving the safety of Mondstadt.</p>\n<p>To Klee, he gives almost everything, his eyepatch, his Mora, everything. He thinks of Master Crepus who looks at a too-skinny too-dark boy with midnight hair and says, <em>come with me. </em>He thinks of his mother, clinging to Kaeya like the last lifeline she has as she sobs so hard her throat gives out, but through her tears, lets her only son leave for a better life, thinks of his father who sacrificed his life to walk his son through a land which rejects him, who gives his final smile and hug and says, <em>my boy. </em></p>\n<p>And then he thinks about Klee and her innocent smile and understands why they all did what they did and then he thinks, <em>my girl. </em></p>\n<p>And then finally, to Diluc, he gifts his vision and his sword.</p>\n<p><em>Look</em>, he wants to say, <em>payment for when I held onto your vision. Payment for when I took your role as Captain. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Did you really keep that vase? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The final day comes, time slipping through him like a ghost. Kaeya just spends the hours just\u2026 walking. He walks through Mondstadt, through the back alleys and the open paths, he spends as much time tracing out his steps, trying to carve the memory of the city into his mind.</p>\n<p>He says his hellos and goodbyes to every person he comes across, no matter how busy they seem, he tries to savour every last moment he has with everyone. His feet ache but he keeps walking, one foot in front of the other. With every step he wanders closer to the end of it all and he doesn\u2019t want to go.</p>\n<p>The sky turns from blue to purple and then Kaeya goes to the Angel\u2019s Share for the final time. Diluc is there, wiping away at a glass as usual.</p>\n<p>The weird little green bard, Venti, is there as well, singing a jovial tune as he strums the strings of his lyre. His eyes meet Kaeya\u2019s and, for the briefest of seconds, there\u2019s surprise on his face. After he finishes the current song, Venti prances over to Kaeya as he\u2019s seating himself, footsteps light and airy.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir Kaeya,\u201d he says as Kaeya raises a hand to order a Death After Noon, \u201cyou\u2019re quite the lucky man, I\u2019d say that rockhead must be a fan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya sighs and says, \u201cno rhyming, less talking, more singing and drinking. I\u2019ll even treat you a glass.\u201d And Venti lets out a whoop, \u201cNo rhyming indeed! No need to pay for more than a drink, I\u2019d feel dreadful for this to be our last memory together.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he turns towards the rest of the rowdy bar and calls out, voice ringing through the ambient chatter like a wind blade slicing through butter, \u201cTonight! It will be the night of nights! Let us all make merry in honour of Sir Kaeya!\u201d</p>\n<p>A cheer rises like a wave from the patrons and Venti brings his fingers to his lyre and plays out a chord which instantly catches Kaeya\u2019s, and the rest of the tavern\u2019s attention. Venti sings of a land where ice covers, which melts away with a burst of flame, then the flame is extinguished by a spray of water and when the water dries, thunder comes and then the people of the land, with their ears pulled towards the sky to hear the words of the divine, they dance and pray to their sacrificial altars and then-</p>\n<p>Venti stops and brings his gaze up to meet Kaeya. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know the rest of the song.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya sips at his glass, \u201ca war comes,\u201d it feels like the tavern goes silent, \u201cthe good people escape the gods\u2019 wrath, or they die. All that are left are the sinners. The sinners are trapped, in a perpetually war-torn land, unable to die, unable to live, unable to dream. And then finally, finally, a pregnant woman gives birth to a boy and the sinners rejoice. An eternity spent in a hell-like world and perhaps someone may be able to escape from the godless land and live a proper life. So they send him far, far away. The mother of the boy cries until she vomits, she clings to him so hard his bones feel like they\u2019re breaking, the father of the boy chooses to sacrifice himself to the gods\u2019 wrath to ensure the boy makes it to the blessed land safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe boy leaves everything he knows and it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen clouds that are fluffy, rather than smog and smoke from burning ruins, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen water drop from the sky, rather than ashfall, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever seen grass and vegetation and animals, rather than desolate ruins,\u201d Kaeya leans back to stretch his back, \u201cand that\u2019s how the rest of the song goes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Venti tilts his head, like a bird seeing something curious, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t sound like a song.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya grimaces and tips back the rest of his glass. The alcohol leaves a burning trail down his throat and the heat sits somewhere in his chest, \u201cno, it doesn\u2019t. Does it?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Kaeya calls out, \u201ctonight is the night of nights! This round of drinks is on me!\u201d The atmosphere lifts, becomes lighter as the air seems to return as if nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc purses his lips as a weird feeling crawls into his chest.</p>\n<p>An hour later, just as Kaeya stands to leave, he puts a small bag of Mora on the bar, far too much to pay for the entire bar\u2019s drinks for the whole night, let alone only the one round.</p>\n<p>\u201cDiluc,\u201d Kaeya says, \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans over the counter and ruffles the red hair with his left hand, \u201cgoodbye, stay out of trouble. Stay safe, my cutest brother.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m not your brother, </em>Diluc wants to say, but then he remembers, <em>ah Kaeya\u2019s going on a journey tomorrow, </em>and instead says, \u201cyou\u2019re being weird.\u201d and Kaeya just laughs, somehow pained, \u201cAren\u2019t I always?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He walks through the darkened streets of Mondstadt and breathes in the cool night\u2019s air. He walks and walks until he reaches the training courtyard behind the Knights\u2019 Headquarters.</p>\n<p>Razor stands, waiting.</p>\n<p>Kaeya sighs. Geo is weak to claymores. He\u2019d wanted it to be Diluc who did it, the one to send him off, but when Diluc had turned his back on him on the first night, had gruffly, in his own words, said \u201cyou need to get yourself healed\u201d, with his ears flushing red and his back looking so small and delicate.</p>\n<p>Kaeya had thought to himself, <em>I can\u2019t do this to you, I can\u2019t make you do it, to force you to be alone again, I can\u2019t put this on your shoulders which already carry the entire burden of Mondstadt. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, like a coward, he turns to Razor, still only a boy, and decides to make him a murderer. Kaeya sends Klee away and says to the youth, \u201cIn six days, I need you to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Razor tips his head and asks, \u201cwhy?\u201d So Kaeya opens his shirt and shows him the amber that fills in all of the cracks that his body has. Razor squints down at the glowing amber and then nods, \u201cYou are\u2026 Dead, already. Not kill, I only put you back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Kaeya says through a forced smile, \u201cbehind the building we came from, when the moon is highest, let\u2019s meet and you will put me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Razor says, \u201cI will make sure to break it well. Anything more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaeya stands before Razor, arms stretched wide, he doesn\u2019t want to go, but he\u2019s done it before- abandoned his family once already, what\u2019s a second time? Razor tightens his grip on his claymore and the air sizzles with electro and purple light dances.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will put you back to nature,\u201d Razor says and a growl bubbles up from his lips as his muscles tense and the heavy sword comes slashing towards Kaeya.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the Angel\u2019s Share, still entertaining the rowdy, drunken crowd, Venti pauses mid-song. He lifts his head towards the door and sighs. Quietly, like a whispering wind, he mournfully murmurs with a solemn strum of his lyre, \u201cAh, it truly is the night of nights.\u201d</p>\n<p>Razor imbues his sword with electricity, he knows that like this, he can break the hardiest of magic crystals, amber that is already crumbling within a human body would never stand a chance.</p>\n<p>Kaeya is not the first human he\u2019s killed, but is certainly the most unique. Razor thinks he\u2019s never felt a human\u2019s flesh give like Kaeya\u2019s had, with a pained wheezing breath, the muscle fibers had loosened and his blood shattered as if he was simply a rotting piece of flesh half imbued with geo.</p>\n<p>Kaeya\u2019s torso crumbles from the force of Razor\u2019s strike, and he catches the top half of Kaeya before he hits the ground, his legs tumbling to the floor and shattering at the knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more geo than human, right now,\u201d Kaeya had said when Razor asked <em>anything more?, </em>\u201cI\u2019d like to have the geo parts of me crushed to dust and the flesh part burnt to ashes. If it\u2019s possible, please scatter the geo powder of my body off the edge of Starsnatch Cliff. I can only pray that they\u2019re durable enough to fly to my homeland. The ashes I\u2019d like to be buried by a bed of mist flowers.\u201d They always were his favourite.</p>\n<p>Razor can easily crush the geo, but his electro isn\u2019t good enough to reduce flesh and bones to ash. <em>Oh, the other red-burny girl, she has a pyro Vision. </em>Razor knows she lives somewhere in the Knights\u2019 dormitories, so he seeks her out.</p>\n<p>When she opens the door to her room for him, she\u2019s rubbing sleep out of her eyes as she asks, \u201cRazor? What do you want so late at night?\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes her by the hand and says, \u201chelp.\u201d and he leads her to Kaeya\u2019s remains. When they\u2019re out in the courtyard, the geo fragments glint off the moonlight and Amber turns stiff in his grasp.</p>\n<p>Razor knows he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, Kaeya was already dead and needed to return to being dead, so he was doing what was natural but\u2026 the scream of anguish that rips from Amber\u2019s throat as she collapses to her knees makes Razor\u2019s heart shake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something not right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been something sitting heavy in the air, it\u2019s been pushing on Diluc\u2019s throat from the moment Kaeya was waiting outside the Angel\u2019s Share, seven nights ago. The song Venti sang, the story Kaeya told, it\u2019s probably the most information Diluc\u2019s ever gotten from Kaeya about his past and it makes him feel sick.</p>\n<p>The unease settles in his chest and crawls into the rest of his body when, in the midst of his festivities, Barbatos pauses and with a sad smile says, \u201cit truly is the night of nights.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc swallows as the atmosphere turns oppressive but no one, not one single person in the tavern, seems to feel it. Something is wrong, wrong, <em>wrong, </em>why can\u2019t anyone else see it? The wind is whistling in all the wrong directions and it\u2019s so loud Diluc wants to drop to his knees and cover his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cBar-d, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Diluc asks, \u201cdo you know anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Barbatos strums a chord and says, melancholy and grief in his voice, \u201cI know many things, like how the wind wails and the earth whispers longevity and the completion of contracts. What I didn\u2019t know until now was how the moon weeps and with it\u2019s pale light, a corpse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d he says and tries not to throw up. The bad feeling swirls and swells within his chest like something too big to fit in his skin and he gestures to Charles, who\u2019s wiping a table, to man the bar. He throws himself out of the tavern, Kaeya said he\u2019d be gone by tomorrow, surely, surely, he\u2019s still in Mondstadt, sleeping peaceful before a long journey.</p>\n<p>Diluc makes it to the central fountain before there\u2019s a wailing shriek coming from the Knights\u2019 Headquarters and every single bit of unease that\u2019s been building within him morphs into horror and he feels it drop like a pit in his stomach. He scales the wall, uncaring of who could see him, the regular path simply would take <em>too long </em>and there\u2019s knights already flooding out of the dormitories, most in half-asleep states, wearing a mismatch of armour and pyjamas and weapons for an emergency.</p>\n<p>The crowd is streamlining towards the training court behind the building and Diluc bolts for it, adrenaline coursing through his veins and as he turns the corner he just\u2026 stops.</p>\n<p>Amber, the Outrider knight, sits on the ground, utterly frozen, with the wild wolf boy, Razor standing next to her, his hand clutching hers.</p>\n<p>And in front, what they\u2019re both staring at is-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Diluc staggers, brushing past the two youths and collapses, heavy on his knees in front of Kaeya. Moonlight glints off deep blue as Diluc\u2019s trembling hands drag Kaeya so his head rests on his lap, he ignores how light Kaeya feels, how all that\u2019s left are his head, torso and his left arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d Diluc says, and his voice shakes, \u201cKaeya.\u201d</p>\n<p>His gloves hands caress the tan cheek, flesh already cold and still. <em>Why are you lying still? </em>Diluc wants to ask, even in his sleep, Diluc remembers Kaeya rolling from side to side, shifting like his skin never fit correctly. Kaeya was supposed to be eternal, never hurt, never still, always grinning and lying and shifting his weight from foot to foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaeya,\u201d Diluc knows he sounds like a lost child, cradling Kaeya to his body and rocking ever so slightly, the word is a prayer to whatever gods would hear, \u201cI\u2019ll get you to a healer, the Deaconess will be able to fix you up. She can heal you back to full health and then we can-\u201d He feels a hand lay gently on his shoulder and peers up to see Jean, the lines on her face speak of disbelief and grief and pity.</p>\n<p>\u201cDiluc,\u201d she says and her tone is so filled with her condolences that Diluc wants to vomit, right there and then, \u201che\u2019s gone. Please, let go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anger boils beneath his skin, like magma and pyro essence bubbling up from his stomach as he hugs Kaeya\u2019s body closer, \u201cno, no, Kaeya wouldn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Look at him,</em>\u201d Jean says, \u201clook at what\u2019s left of him. We\u2019ll arrange a funeral and check his will when the sun comes up and we\u2019ll need to investigate how he died, if there was any foul play-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Knights of Favonius are incompetent,\u201d Diluc snaps and Jean\u2019s hand flinches from his shoulder but he can\u2019t bring himself to care, \u201cthat\u2019s twice that I\u2019ve been wronged by them. How could you let this happen to your <em>Captain? </em>Useless, useless, I\u2019ll be the one to find his killer and avenge him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc wracks his brain, there\u2019s geo fragments all around Kaeya\u2019s body. The only two geo Visions Diluc knows of both belong to the Knights, Albedo and Noelle. Neither of which he knows well, both known more through reputation and Kaeya\u2019s tales he told while at Angel\u2019s Share. Perhaps there could\u2019ve been someone with a geo Vision travelling through Mondstadt, maybe even a member of the Fatui delegation, who else, who else could\u2019ve done this?</p>\n<p>\u201cI did it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amber stops her sobbing to let out a scandalised, \u201cRazor!\u201d and the wolf boy tilts his head, \u201cI just did what Mr. Kaeya asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc feels heat swirl, flames licking at his hair and rage simmering in his Vision. <em>\u201cYou,\u201d </em>he snarls, \u201cYou did this?\u201d</p>\n<p>His claymore\u2019s summoned and in his palms before he even knows what\u2019s happening, his mind a one-track line of <em>how dare you how dare you how DARE YOU?! </em>Pyro burns, the flames crawl over Diluc\u2019s skin as he gently lays Kaeya to the ground and pulls himself to his feet. Fire covers the blade as Diluc readies his weapon. And soft, seething and dangerous, he says, \u201cyou will pay for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Razor looks unsure, his stance widening as he too summons his claymore. <em>He looks young, </em>Diluc thinks, and then, <em>he killed Kaeya. </em></p>\n<p>Lifting the tip of the heavy blade from the stone floor and shattered geo crystals and strips of flesh and Diluc charges at the wolf boy, rage seething, roiling under his skin like magma pushing it\u2019s way up a volcano and he\u2019s going to burnburnburn everythi-</p>\n<p>The ground leaves his feet and he\u2019s sent hurtling into the air, feet scrambling, trying to find purchase to keep pushing forward to get to Kaeya\u2019s murderer but there\u2019s nothing to find, no floor beneath him as all his forward momentum halts and Diluc flutters gently to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bard,\u201d </em>Diluc snarls, all respect towards Mondstadt\u2019s once-god hidden away, behind a veil of grief and rage in his mind, <em>fuck the consequences, let me be smited, </em>he wants to say as he lands on the ground and his knees give. All Barbatos does is look gently down at him as he saunters over to Kaeya\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cActing Grandmaster,\u201d Barbatos says, \u201cyou can dismiss the rest of the Knights. Master Diluc and I need to speak about some things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jean looks tired, she looks weary, and mourning and so, <em>so </em>exhausted. But she lifts her hand and tells the watchful Knights, \u201cSleep now. I\u2019ll debrief all of you in the morn. Put this incident out of your minds and we can deal with it tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>They look doubtful, some even look distressed, but they all reluctantly trickle back into the dormitories with quiet mutterings.</p>\n<p>Diluc sneers at them as they go, but still can\u2019t quite find any way to bring strength to his legs and Barbatos leans down to pick up Kaeya. He strokes Kaeya\u2019s head like a parent soothing their child and addresses Diluc, \u201cPlease refrain from hurting Razor, he was simply doing what he was meant to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc bares his teeth, \u201cYou\u2019re not rhyming.\u201d and Barbatos waves it off, \u201cSir Kaeya\u2019s last wish for me, no rhymes for tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He places Kaeya in Diluc\u2019s lap, let\u2019s him see what\u2019s left of him in the bright moonlight. There\u2019s nothing but half a torso, one arm and his head and he looks\u2026 peaceful.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir Kaeya who was killed, seven days ago. The wind cried out so long and loud for him, but the earth rose up and held him together long enough to set his affairs in order. A rockhead he may be, but I believe even he has grown to understand grief and longing\u2026\u201d Barbatos murmurs, \u201cAren\u2019t you glad, Master Diluc? With his last seven days on this land, he did not once let his thoughts stray from Mondstadt. And you, Sir Ragnvindr, were both the first, and last person he greeted with his borrowed time. What an honour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an injustice,\u201d Diluc says and runs his hand through midnight blue locks of hair and brings Kaeya up to press their foreheads together.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kaeya.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love your father?\u201d Diluc asks, peering down at Kaeya with big eyes. They\u2019ve been waiting for hours at the spot where Crepus first met the outlander, both young boys settled on a picnic mat under a fruiting sunsietta tree, their watchful maids sitting far enough in the undergrowth to not hear the words of their conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do!\u201d Kaeya insists. His eyes turn not to the road, but the forests where the maids sit. He looks\u2026 Guilty, and scared, and somehow sad, \u201cHe said he\u2019d go and get grape juice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc thinks about it, \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t come back yet.\u201d and Kaeya gets angry so suddenly that it almost scares Diluc, \u201cHe loves me! He hugged me! If Mister Crepus never came back for you, would <em>you </em>love him still?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I would!\u201d Diluc yells back and opens his mouth to yell some more before he realises how stupid his words were that he feels his teeth snap closed and a bright red flush cross his face. He settles back down onto the picnic mat with hot tears springing to the corner of his eyes as he says, \u201csorry, I was dumb. He probably came back and couldn\u2019t find you. He\u2019ll come back soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya lowers his gaze to the grass and tears out a handful, squeezes it between his fingers before dropping it into Diluc\u2019s lap. He sniffs and says, \u201cyeah, you are pretty dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both don\u2019t mention the tears streaking down Kaeya\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kaeya.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Diluc returns to Mondstadt, Kaeya\u2019s changed so much he can barely tell they were the same person. He walks with such a confident and open gait, nothing like the shrinking scrawny boy who showed up behind Crepus, soaked to the bone like a wet dog.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s grown bigger, broader, all long legs and long hair and long lashes and a chest he shows off to the world, as if the shirts he wears can\u2019t contain it all. Diluc only comes up to his eyes and years later, he\u2019d war between feeling relieved that he\u2019s grown so well, and indignant that his position as the taller one of the two had been usurped. But at that time all Diluc can see is Kaeya\u2019s stupid face, the scent of rain and freshly turned dirt and the sound of <em>Khaenri\u2019ahn spy, </em>so there\u2019s nothing he feels but bitterness and betrayal as he brushes past Kaeya and ignores his greetings.</p>\n<p>In the Angel\u2019s Share, he\u2019ll sometimes lament while rubbing stains and marks off of glass while he hears lies and deceit drips from Kaeya\u2019s lips like a well-refined poison.</p>\n<p>Ah, where did that little boy go? The one who, on the first night when Crepus had laid a hand on a blue head of hair, both dripping on the front doormat, looked at Diluc\u2019s pale skin and red, red, red with something like wonder in his eyes.</p>\n<p>The one who stared in awe at the feast of a dinner Crepus had the servants produce, <em>you\u2019re too skinny, boy, </em>and with shaking hands and doubtful eyes taken that first bite of steaming meat and almost choked from the flavour. He\u2019d ate and ate until he threw up onto his own lap, almost cried from the humiliation, and after the maids had cleaned up the sick, ate some more. Diluc looks at his bony arms and thinks to himself, <em>good. </em></p>\n<p>The one who had been so, so reluctant to leave, when the first snowfall of the winter had come. Diluc almost had to drag him out and when the first snowflake landed on his nose, he\u2019d flinched so hard he ripped his hands from Diluc\u2019s before he paused, and said with quiet awe, <em>it doesn\u2019t hurt? </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Hurt? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ashfall usually burns the eyes and nose.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s not ash! It\u2019s snow, made from cold water.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Oh, right.</p>\n<p>That boy had managed to wither away and die while Diluc wasn\u2019t looking, or he\u2019d been tucked away into a box and shoved so far back that he\u2019d never see light or snow ever again, or he\u2019d been cut apart, all the innocent and happy parts sliced from bitter bones to be salted and stored as long-lasting fragments of memory-jerky.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Poor, poor Kaeya.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc wakes up.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seated upon a stone stool, before a stone table. A bowl of steaming soup and a warm cup of tea sit innocuously in front of him. To his right, a small wind spirit sat upon the table, cheerfully pouring himself a cup of Dandelion Wine, across from him Kaeya, next to him, gold and brown and majestic, a damn <em>dragon. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Diluc says stupidly. A leaf flutters down and lands in his soup, a gingko leaf. Maidenhair tree. This must be Liyue.</p>\n<p>\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d Kaeya says, the grin he stretches across his face makes him look like he\u2019s about to cry. The wind spirit lifts the cup, which is almost half his size, and drinks the alcohol, \u201cabout time too, without my Gnosis it really did put a strain on me to bring you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dragon, coiled three times around and yet still spilling off it\u2019s stool, lets out a rumble that seems to shake the earth itself like tectonic plates grinding together, \u201cthe final night is not yet over. Until the sun rises, the contract of settling all worldly affairs is unsettled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind us,\u201d the wind spirit says, \u201cMorax and I have much to catch up on, it\u2019s been hundreds of years, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an awkward silence as the wind spirit and the dragon turn to the side and begin conversing quietly, the words they speak seem to slip from Diluc\u2019s mind like grains of sand between fingers so he stops trying to eavesdrop. Kaeya stares at him, fond and sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I touch your hair?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Can I touch your hair? </em>Thin, tiny fingers card through crimson locks gentle, careful, combing out any tangles they come across through the curls, <em>it looks so much like fire, but it doesn\u2019t burn at all! </em></p>\n<p>From that single question, the conversation between the two pulls from between their teeth like water through a net. Flowing easily and quickly, they reminisce, they laugh, they chitter and chatter and at some point they both begin sobbing, loud, heaving wails that rip from their lungs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d the dragon says, and the wind spirit sighs, \u201cit is indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya pushes himself to his feet, sleeves soaked with tears and he manages out, \u201cTake care of Klee for me, will you? Sometimes Albedo goes out on long expeditions and Klee is <em>my girl, </em>okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Diluc whimpers as he chokes on tears and mucus and the wind spirit flutters over to sit on his shoulder, giving his cheek a light pat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the fourth time.</p>\n<p>Fourth time that Diluc\u2019s lost Kaeya.</p>\n<p>The first was in the rain, betrayal running through his veins as Kaeya looks at him with lies on his lips, the second, alone, bleeding out, staring at the back of a Mitachurl as it wanders away to find a new tribe of churls, the third, beneath a weeping moon, geo sparkling and flesh stagnant, and the fourth, resigned, walking away between two gods.</p>\n<p>Diluc sobs as he reaches out a hand, <em>what a disgrace, </em>his mind whispers, <em>you lost him a long, long time ago, why are you still clinging? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc wakes up.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in his bed in the room above Angel\u2019s Share. He\u2019s a mess, his pillow stained wet with tears and his throat burning raw and eyes swollen and red. There\u2019s a summon for him to come to the Knights of Favonious\u2019 headquarters.</p>\n<p>He goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Outside of a room, in the hallway, there\u2019s a little girl in red lying on the floor. She\u2019s drawing something on paper with a blue crayon.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Diluc,\u201d she says unsurely as she peer up at him as he approaches, \u201care you here for Mister Kaeya\u2019s things too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo?\u201d He asks,</p>\n<p>\u201cYup!\u201d She says and kicks her feet, \u201cMister Kaeya\u2019s gone on a journey, but Miss Barbara said that it\u2019s a different kind of adventure that my mum went on! Mister Kaeya isn\u2019t going to be back for a suuuuper long, long time!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Take care of Klee for me, will you? </em>Diluc pats her on the head and tries to make his voice even out, \u201cthat\u2019s right. I think I\u2019m here to collect some things for Kaeya. \"Oh? What are you drawing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee raises her paper to show off her drawing proudly, \u201cIt\u2019s Mister Kaeya! And it\u2019s me! It\u2019s Mister Kaeya telling Klee all of Klee\u2019s Survival Rules. I\u2019m going to draw one picture of him every day until he comes back, because he said he really likes my drawings. Did you know he keeps every single one that I give him?\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives the drawing a severe look, and then nods, \u201cit is a very good drawing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee beams at Diluc and he can\u2019t help but remember the fond, faraway look Kaeya had on his face when he\u2019d said,<em> Klee is my girl. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc understands now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jean looks tired, she looks like she\u2019s been crying for hours on end, just like Diluc has, as she hands over a sheathed sword and small, heavy box.</p>\n<p>Diluc opens it and its a Vision, Kaeya\u2019s Vision. The gemstone in the middle dulled and grey and nowhere near as frosted cold as it should\u2019ve been. Somehow, seeing it with his own eyes let\u2019s Diluc feel how truly final everything is.</p>\n<p>Kaeya should\u2019ve been eternal, but now he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s gone. And all Diluc can do is send every prayer, every ounce of faith left in him, to beg every Archon and god to allow Kaeya to rest peacefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>I pray, in your next life, the world is kinder to you, kinder for every injustice it\u2019s served you, and I pray we can meet once again. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stay safe, my cutest brother. </em>\n</p>\n<p>So there\u2019s a few things I want to chit-chat about.</p>\n<p>I got a question about the <em>between two gods </em>line and I included it because I loved the idea that Kaeya, being from Khaenri\u2019ah - the land where the gods\u2019 gaze does not fall, managed to live such a life where despite being born to no god, he\u2019s able to gracefully walk to his death whilst being escorted by Barbatos and Morax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diluc: subconsciously, he knew something was off. But he\u2019s like any other person who ignores that tiny niggling feeling of unease and tries to either justify why everything is off, or deny that anything terrible is happening, at least until the truth is before his eyes and he can no longer deny it, hehe.</p>\n<p>Jean: I wonder how she felt, with her last words being so harsh~ Kaeya specifically did all of his paperwork to make it easier on her when he passes, he even wrote out a will and set all the official business in order, even assigning a successor to the Cavalry Captain title.</p>\n<p>Razor: I really liked the idea that as someone who had lived wild and dipped so far in nature would be able to take a single look at Kaeya and realise, <em>ah yes, something unnatural which must be returned back to the normal order. </em></p>\n<p>Kaeya: seems like the type of character to show love through actions rather than words. He tried words once, and look how that ended for him, Diluc bitter and betrayed and raging. Understandable, have a nice day.</p>\n<p>Klee: \u201cMister Diluc is so grumpy, he should smile more. When Mister Kaeya comes back, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be happy again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Klee, only a few years older now, knocks on the door of the Angel\u2019s Share. The usual patrons are familiar with the little girl and make space for her to peep over the counter of the bar. Diluc stares down at her, \u201cWhat do you want, Klee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want the blue crayon,\u201d Klee says, \u201cand a red one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blue crayon is a dark navy, Klee tends to use it only when she draws Kaeya, it\u2019s barely a stump nowadays, but she stubbornly tries and tries to use it, even when she struggles and has to drag it across the paper with her forefinger. Klee and Diluc get the red crayon, Lisa is purple, Jean and Barbara a light blue, Noel and Albedo are orange.</p>\n<p>Diluc pulls open the cupboard that used to hold the spirits, but is instead filled with slowly aging papers, and hands over the requested colours.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you going to draw today?\u201d He asks and Klee pushes an adventurer from his stool to take his seat. Kicking her legs, \u201cI\u2019m going to draw Mister Kaeya, and Klee, and Mister Diluc. I drew Miss Lisa with us yesterday, so today is your turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Diluc says and returns his attention to wiping away any water stains from a wine glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Diluc,\u201d Klee pipes up, \u201cYou\u2019re going to save this one in your cupboard too, right? For when Mister Kaeya comes back home, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Diluc wets his lips, \u201cof course I will, your room is too full now and that cupboard never held anything too important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee hums and turns back to her drawing, she\u2019s gotten better at drawing lately, Diluc notes. Suddenly, she stops and stares, looking at her forefinger stained blue and the crayon she was using gone, nothing but a little dark fragment against her skin. She hunches in on herself, gaze drifting to the half finished Kaeya on the page, he looks a bit like an egg with a dark top and an eyepatch and she says, \u201cMister Diluc, I think I need a new crayon.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs and reaches back into the Klee cupboard, handing her a fresh navy blue and she grips it tightly with both hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Diluc,\u201d She says and when she brings her gaze to meet his, red and red, tears brim and overflow, \u201cfor some reason, I can\u2019t remember what Mister Kaeya looked like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming back, is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ehe ;)</p>\n<p>Klee: Mister Kaeya will definitely be back before I finish using up this crayon!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While I am really proud of this work and the suffering I had to go through to write it, there\u2019s one part that I really wanted to share and I just\u2026. I really wanted to write it into the fic but I couldn\u2019t fit it anywhere and it wouldn\u2019t flow well enough so I scrapped it.</p>\n<p>It was supposed to be me dipping my little nasty fingers into the concept of family, where Kaeya, in those few last days, goes searching for an Abyss Mage to have a last conversation with someone with the fellow experience of Khaenri\u2019ah. The idea was meant to be that in their shared suffering of the land, all the citizens of Khaenri\u2019ah had become closer than family, thus why Kaeya referred to Dainsleif as \u2018Uncle\u2019.</p>\n<p>There was supposed to be a funeral for Kaeya, which three Abyss Mages would crash, representing the role of \u2018father\u2019 and \u2018mother\u2019 and the rest of the \u2018family\u2019, give their prayers and passing gifts on behalf of Kaeya\u2019s family who couldn\u2019t make it.</p>\n<p>But I couldn\u2019t fit it into the main story because I really wanted the story to Mondstadt focused and I felt that bring up Khaenri\u2019ah too much would cause the characters to call Kaeya\u2019s loyalties into question and that it\u2019s cause the story to be stuck far too much into the past.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>SCREAMS @frozendxwn on twitter did an amazing comic hhhh my heart exploded when i saw it!!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/frozendxwn/status/1359014055269330944</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>THERE'S AN ANIMATIC!!! ITS SO CUTE AAAUUGHGHHH</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkN9SEzsk90</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>GO LOOK AT IT AND GIVE THEM LOVE</p>\n<p>Kaeya seeks out the Abyss Mage by the Thousand Winds Temple. Reports had been flooding in that it had been lingering by one of the ruins, particularly by Doolan and Patchi who have a tendency to linger by the temple.</p>\n<p>Even if the Knights did send in someone to eliminate it, it\u2019s not like it\u2019d be a permanent solution. As far as Kaeya knows, it doesn\u2019t cause too much trouble so long as nobody ventures too near, it lingers, people stay away.</p>\n<p>When Kaeya approaches it, he calls out to it as he draws closer. He raises his hands and tries to ignore the way the movement pulls at the cor lapis crusting his chest, \u201cI mean no harm, I just want to speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mage turns to him, staff raised and white-blue, \u201cdrop your sword,\u201d it demands, nasal and wary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaeya does.</p>\n<p>He drops it onto the grass and kicks it in the opposite direction of the mage, \u201cI just want to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>It looks him up and down, scoffs, and slowly floats over to him, a trail of ice covering the thin water, \u201cPoor child. So young and already dead, huh? What a waste.\u201d The mage only comes up to Kaeya\u2019s waist but it pulls at his belt, \u201cyou\u2019re a stick. Did those humans not feed you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya flops down, sitting in the water and ignoring the soaked-through feeling of clothes stuck to skin. He can barely feel the cold as the mage sits down beside him, the ice encases his feet and it feels like <em>home, </em>\u201cIt\u2019s better. Here, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mage stays silent. \u201cBack then, we couldn\u2019t eat. The land wouldn\u2019t take, no matter what we did to till the fields, there were no animals left. Only us. Did you know,\u201d He says quietly, \u201cOne time Aunty disappeared for a night? We ate well then - it was the first time I tasted meat, and when she came back she was <em>different.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d The mage says, \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaeya puts his head into his hands and it all finally hits him, \u201cI died. I died and I didn\u2019t do anything to help Khaenri\u2019ah, I just <em>ran </em>and <em>lived</em>, I\u2019ve wasted my life and all the hope of everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy family,\u201d He feels like that child again, standing with numbed legs and tears in his eyes with cold and unforgiving rain battering him down, \u201c<em>Mama, Papa, </em>I want to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where,\u201d The mage asks, \u201cIs your home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it here, where the lands are green and food is in abundance? Or is it there, the five hundred years spent in that place where every breath is smoke and ash?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaeya pulls at his hair, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Is it there or here? I want to go home, I don\u2019t want to die! I\u2019m, I still have so much to do and I haven\u2019t done a single thing at all. My home, family? It should be where my family is, right? That\u2019s what people always say?\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like a betrayal, the words he\u2019s speaking. Does he really, truly wish to go back to Khaenri\u2019ah? The suffering, it used to be all he knew, but now\u2026 He thinks about Klee, the way she smiles at him like he can do no wrong - like he knows everything in the world and here he is, sitting in the ice water and <em>doubting</em>, Diluc would think him ridiculous. Red, bright and clear Diluc, even when he was eighteen, when he\u2019d thrown away everything in Mondstadt and Kaeya too, he\u2019d still been a straight shot - firing directly in his own direction, never stopping, never wavering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not even for Kaeya.</p>\n<p>Kaeya\u2019d heard about the rumours, the mysterious person tearing through the ranks of the Fatui, and tried not to think <em>that should be us, together. </em>In the end, Diluc came back and that\u2019s all that matters, even if he came back different, like Aunty, unrecognizable with the pieces bitten out of him. The Diluc Kaeya knew gone, the innocence and kindness ripped out, but that\u2019s not exactly right, right?</p>\n<p>Diluc is still kind, there\u2019s simply not enough kindness left for Kaeya - he\u2019d hit that limit a long time ago and tried to keep <em>taking</em>. Of course Diluc would hate him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Kaeya sobs out, his chest crackles with each gasping breath, \u201cI want to go back to when I could be greedy and take and people would give, I want to go home! I don\u2019t know, <em>I don\u2019t know, </em>my family, who is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The mage offers no consolation, it just sits, quiet. Kaeya cries, deep and chesty and ugly, \u201cit hurts, it hurts, it hurts. <em>What do I do? I want my family, I want Mama and Papa and Klee and Diluc and Mondstadt.</em> I hate being here, I don\u2019t want to go back there!<em>\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cChild,\u201d the mage says, \u201cDo you know why I linger here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The abrupt question shoots through Kaeya with startling clarity, \u201cIt\u2019s because this old ruin, it reminds me of home.\u201d It slowly floats away from him, settling back into the middle of the ruin, \u201cyou can have more than one family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a failure,\u201d Kaeya breathes, it feels like ice crystals forming in his lungs, tearing through soft tissue, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father would be proud,\u201d it says, not disputing Kaeya\u2019s words, \u201cyour mother loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow get out of my sight, you still have family to say goodbye to.\u201d</p>"
