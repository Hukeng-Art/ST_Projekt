  "summary": "<p>The summer after senior year starts normally enough, with the gang spending their final months before college together at the Martin family's lake house. Then Jackson stumbles onto the burial ground of a witch's ex-husband, Stiles is magically turned into a fox, and things somehow manage to get worse from there.

  "notes": "<p>This was actually for the Teen Wolf Reverse Bang due in January, but unfortunately there were delays in production from both artist and author, so here it is over five months later, oops.

It\u2019s marginally better than Scott\u2019s reaction, but only because Derek hasn\u2019t passed out from blood loss and there\u2019s not a gaping wound in his side.</p>\n<p>Stiles would sigh, but he\u2019s not sure his current body is capable of such a reaction.</p>\n<p>Instead, he headbutts Derek in the gut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The summer after senior year starts with tears, the required hugging, fond farewells, and Lydia demanding that everyone spends the next few months at her family\u2019s old lake house, just outside the county line of Beacon Hills. Come fall, they\u2019ll be scattered across the state and country - some as far away as the Northeast coast - and she refuses to waste the summer apart, only seeing each other when they need her expertise in dead languages.</p>\n<p>The fun lasts all of a week, with even Derek letting loose on the tire swing, before Jackson stumbles onto a cursed burial ground containing the ex-husband of an angry witch (because witches, why not?).</p>\n<p>\u00a0It all goes to hell from there.</p>\n<p>Derek, Erica, and Boyd suggest the all-out offensive approach, attacking with everything they\u2019ve got. Scott suggests they try to talk to the witch. Stiles suggests they offer Jackson as a sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Predictably, no one gets on board with Stiles\u2019 idea. Which is why he thinks everyone shares the blame when the witch sarcastically compares him to a fox - clever and pretending he\u2019s an animal with the wolves - and Stiles finds himself walking on four legs moments later.</p>\n<p>The witch and her dead ex-husband disappear after that.</p>\n<p>Deaton is pretty useless, with a promise to check in if he finds anything.</p>\n<p>Jackson sort of apologizes for the mess he\u2019s caused.</p>\n<p>Scott heals just fine.</p>\n<p>Stiles is still a fox.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Growling, Stiles takes a running leap at Derek, legs tangling clumsily in his now oversized red hoodie as his paws awkwardly hit the ground. He manages it anyway, headbutting Derek right in the gut, and Derek grunts, the attack catching him off guard as he gets shoved into the tree behind him by the surprisingly strong little animal. He slides down the trunk until he\u2019s sitting on a damp bed of leaves, which just barely protect him from painful knotting roots underneath. It\u2019s uncomfortable, but preferable to the raging glare coming inches from his face, annoyed brown eyes somehow still the same even when surrounded by red fur.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will <em>fix this</em>,\u201d Stiles hisses, a paw coming up to poke threateningly at Derek\u2019s chest. The sleeve of his hoodie covers it, dangling far below where his foreleg ends, and the sight only fills Stiles with more rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-\u201c Derek tries to get out, expression completely bewildered. He glances up helplessly at the others, who respond with either concerned looks or hopeless shrugs. Stiles snaps his teeth and Derek turns his face back to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis? This is <em>your</em> fault,\u201d Stiles growls, paw poking again. This time Derek peeks over specifically at Jackson, who\u2019s doing an excellent job of finding the moss on a rock interesting.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Derek argues, feeling a pressure beginning to build behind his eyes, \u201cHow-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Your fault</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek allows a growl of his own to escape, tempted to experiment and see if his alpha powers will work on all supernatural canines. He doesn\u2019t shove Stiles off him, reminds himself that the kid is no bigger than a bob cat, and less than gently picks him up from his lap instead, dropping Stiles in the dirt next to him. Stiles bristles at the treatment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who decided to go off on his own and piss off a witch,\u201d Derek snaps, gesturing toward Jackson in a way that he hopes conveys how very much he wishes they had gone with Stiles and sacrificed the asshole.\u00a0 The response isn\u2019t enough to appease Stiles, who leaps to his feet and starts an odd hopping motion from side to side, riled up as if he\u2019s ready to pounce.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude! He\u2019s <em>your</em> beta!\u201d Stiles barks, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have that shit on lockdown!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Jackson speaks up finally, stepping forward with his lips curled in disdain. \u201cI am <em>no one\u2019s</em> beta.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia shushes him before Stiles can act on the impulse to bite a chunk out of Jackson\u2019s thigh; she pets his chest patronizingly, muttering a cloying, \u201cNot now, honey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes, Derek pushes himself up from the ground. He brushes the dirt off his pants, front and back, and steps over Stiles to head back toward the lake house.</p>\n<p>Stiles contemplates finding something of his to pee on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB-final-small.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"618\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a day, during which time Stiles finds every single way to be a pain in the ass to Jackson short of actually biting him, but Deaton\u2019s SUV eventually makes its way up the dusty driveway. He comes inside and sets his briefcase on the kitchen table. When he opens it, revealed is what seems to be a mix of CSI equipment and things more likely found in a magic shop.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, are you gonna do experiments on me?\u201d Stiles wonders nervously, trying to scuttle off the kitchen table. \u201c'Cause I\u2019m not so okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott stands behind Stiles, blocking his exit, and puts a comforting hand on his back to hold him in place.</p>\n<p>Deaton laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he assures, voice warm, \u201cI\u2019m just going to take a few samples of your fur, saliva, and skin cells to see if there\u2019s any magic I can trace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEhhhhh,\u201d Stiles wiggles, not sure he wants to go through whatever the process of that entails. \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n<p>Rolling her eyes, Lydia grabs a brush from Deaton\u2019s kit and steps forward, dragging the bristles down Stiles\u2019 back hard enough that the teeth dig into his skin. He shivers at the feeling, something tingly traveling over his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d she says, holding the brush out to Deaton. \u201cHair and skin cells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton takes the brush with visible amusement, placing it inside a clear plastic bag and zipping the bag shut.</p>\n<p>Without asking, Lydia digs through Deaton\u2019s things again, coming up with a petri dish. She uses her perfectly manicured nails to pry it open, then holds the bottom half under Stiles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cLick,\u201d she commands. He does so, too startled to do much else, and watches as she snaps the petri dish shut, handing that to Deaton as well.\u00a0 She smiles disarmingly, gives a feminine shrug of her shoulders as she says, \u201cAll done!\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton shakes his head with a wry grin as he places the petri dish securely back into his briefcase.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he begins, pulling out a few more sampling kits. \u201cWho\u2019s going to show me where this witch\u2019s burial ground was?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott goes to volunteer, but Lydia cuts him off with a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Jackson would like to go,\u201d she offers sweetly. An indignant noise escapes from Jackson\u2019s mouth. He folds his arms across his chest, taking a step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson!\u201d Lydia snaps, then smiles again as she regains her composure. \u201cYou were the one who found it in the first place remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a very audible threat under her words.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jackson grimaces, shoulders sagging as he sees no way out. \u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Turning toward the door, he mutters, \u201cFollow me,\u201d lowly, as if hoping no one would hear him and actually heed his words.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Jackson, Deaton is trailing right behind him.</p>\n<p>As soon as they leave, Lydia begins caressing Stiles\u2019 back thoughtfully, lips pursed as she considers him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she says, after watching him long enough that Stiles is beginning to feel anxious, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see what wearing fox felt like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Stiles glances around the room, makes sure Scott is still within close range. \u201cYou know what, that\u2019s really interesting, Lydia, thanks for the info. I\u2019ll keep that in mind for your next birthDAY-!\u201d His words end on a squeak as Lydia lifts him off the table, draping him around her neck like an old fashioned shawl.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asks Allison, posing dramatically, throwing Stiles\u2019 tail over her shoulder like it\u2019s not a fucking appendage. Allison giggles, reaching over to scratch behind Stiles\u2019 ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your accessory likes it very much,\u201d she says with a smile. When Lydia scoffs, the movement of her shoulders jostles Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy accessory has an infinite wardrobe of plaid,\u201d she breezes, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get a say in fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, this really blows,\u201d Stiles tries conversationally.</p>\n<p>As expected, he\u2019s ignored in favor of Lydia asking Allison about the shade of lip-gloss she\u2019s wearing, which is somehow more important than the fact that one of her best friends is a fox and currently wrapped around her neck in a sick facsimile of something dead and stuffed.</p>\n<p>He shoots Scott a pleading look, but his best friend just shrugs helplessly.</p>\n<p>This is going to be a fucking terrible summer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Isn\u2019t that a wonderful beginning?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u2013</em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A furry ear twitches at the first chirps of morning, catching the sounds of birds waking from miles away where the sun has already risen.\u00a0 It\u2019s still dark out, there\u2019s still silence from the immediate vicinity, but Stiles hears the birds, <em>feels</em> morning, and when he peeks an eye open, the clock on the TV unit says it\u2019s barely after four.</p>\n<p>His irritation makes its way out of him as a snarl and he starts up, surprising himself with the noise. A glance around the room informs him that Erica and Boyd are still asleep, curled around each other, and he takes a moment to consider how entirely unfair it is that neither of them have been forced awake by birds in the next county over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jumping down from his perch on the sofa chair, he quietly makes his way to the door, paws barely making any noise against the wood. It had taken him a full day to figure out how to walk without his claws extended, and he appreciates that skill now as he awkwardly noses the door open as silently as possible.</p>\n<p>He creeps through the hallway, listening to the snores coming from Jackson and Lydia\u2019s room, can hear the sheets rustling as Isaac tosses and turns a few doors down.\u00a0 Carefully, he hops down the steps, fighting back a yawn.</p>\n<p>When he gets downstairs, he ignores Scott and Allison on the couch, where they fell asleep watching movies, and wanders straight to the kitchen. In the corner, by the garbage can, are two bowls on the ground, and as he approaches, a pitiful whimper escapes before he can stop it when he realizes they\u2019re empty.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis fucking sucks, man,\u201d he mutters to himself, padding over to the fridge. He stares up at the looming appliance, trying to measure the distance from the floor to the handle. He\u2019s kind of scrawny for a fox, but he\u2019s not small; he knows he can theoretically make it easily. Length and height don\u2019t help him, though, when he\u2019s not sure he can control his limbs enough yet to pull off the task.</p>\n<p>Rearing up onto his hind legs, Stiles drops his front paws against the fridge, bringing him level to the handle. He considers trying to use his arms to drag the fridge open, then decides on his mouth being the more effective option. He grips the handle in his jaw and pulls, squeaking when the door flies open and he falls, hitting the island roughly.</p>\n<p>From the couch, Scott mumbles something and Stiles can hear the springs creak as someone gets up. The lighter footfalls means it\u2019s Allison, and within a few seconds she\u2019s appearing around the corner, looking sleep mussed and confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she wonders, blearily gazing at the fridge.\u00a0 Her eyes wander from the fridge to the empty bowls on the floor and she tsks as she wipes the sleep from her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson forgot to feed you last night,\u201d she sighs, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need someone to feed me,\u201d Stiles snaps, bristling at the way she smiles at him and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes \u2013 which is more like rolling his head in this vulpine body \u2013 Stiles leaps onto the kitchen island, tail flopping behind him as he sits by the edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want waffles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison shoots him a skeptical glance over her shoulder, pulling out the orange juice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even five yet,\u201d she retorts. She places the juice bottle by Stiles and reaches down to grab one of the bowls. \u201cIt\u2019ll wake everyone else up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a snorting sound, claws tapping against the countertop as he fixes her with the best unimpressed stare he thinks his face can manage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison, I\u2019m a fucking fox. Do you really think my priority right now is other people\u2019s comfort?\u201d He pauses. \u201cHas my priority <em>ever </em>been other people\u2019s comfort?\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughing softly, she drops the bowl next to the juice and reaches over to scratch Stiles behind the ear. He resists for all of a second, before letting out a pleased noise, tilting his head to give her better access.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019ve always been kind of an asshole,\u201d she says fondly. Stiles takes a little pride in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, waffles it is,\u201d she decides, grinning at the way Stiles\u2019 tail begins to beat rapidly against the counter.\u00a0 He looks over when he hears Scott coming, the boy yawning as he blindly tumbles into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWaffles?\u201d he mutters, still half-asleep. \u00a0Allison kisses him on the cheek and shoves him into a stool at the island, where he drops his head down into his arms. Stiles feels a weird urge to sidle over and curl up beside him.</p>\n<p>He gives in when Allison begins mixing the batter, tucking himself beside the crook of Scott\u2019s neck, dropping his front paws on top of his best friend\u2019s head. It\u2019s warm and he feels safe and cozy and he wonders if this is what being a cat is like.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an hour later when he wakes up from the nap he slipped into, only budging because Scott is moving. Derek and Isaac have joined them in the kitchen, talking to Allison as she takes the pancake batter out of the fridge to start preparing breakfast, and Stiles wonders how he could have slept through it when birds singing a mile away had kept him awake this morning.</p>\n<p>Scott shifts positions, softly snoring again, and Stiles thinks maybe he could go back to sleep even with the added noise. He thinks back to cats, thinks about the fact that he was alone on the chair in the guest room and now he\u2019s with his best friend and maybe it\u2019s instinct \u2013 maybe his foxbrain doesn\u2019t feel like it needs to be as alert when he\u2019s secure.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d dwell on it further, but then Isaac is gently running his fingernails over Stiles\u2019 back, scratching at the skin beneath the fur and Stiles still can\u2019t get over how certain touches make his mind go blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna spoil him,\u201d Derek snorts from somewhere above.</p>\n<p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Stiles mutters. After a moment, Derek\u2019s hand lands on his head, rubbing between the ears. With the smell of waffles in the atmosphere and hands caressing him as he lays on top of Scott, Stiles thinks that maybe being a fox for a few days isn\u2019t going to be so bad.</p>\n<p>His opinion changes by the time breakfast is served and Stiles\u2019 plate is set on the floor by Scott\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB02-scottstiles.jpg\" alt width=\"600\" height=\"433\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d Stiles groans for not the first time, head dangling upside down. He watches from the couch as Isaac and Boyd play Mortal Kombat on the SEGA console Boyd had brought with him. \u00a0Isaac is pressing all the wrong buttons and Stiles would run over there and grab the control out of his hands if he could.</p>\n<p>Allison scratches his tummy as she reads her book and Stiles pretends not to love it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Jackson snaps, lounging in a chair and clearly not working on it. Stiles huffs, rolling over.\u00a0 Shaking his fur out, he stretches, hearing some bones crack, then crawls into Allison\u2019s lap. She makes an amused noise and runs her fingers through his fur.</p>\n<p>Scott walks into the room, takes in the sight and says, \u201cDude, get off my girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking fox,\u201d Stiles retorts, because that\u2019s become his go-to defense for anything he does that might not be kosher.\u00a0 He may be among werewolves, but he\u2019s pretty sure none of them have ever been an <em>actual</em> animal before, and so his trump card remains an active weapon that he utilizes as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Scott rolls his eyes and wanders over, shoving Stiles off of Allison\u2019s lap. Stiles barks at him, a noise that surprises them both, then scowls and looks away to hide his embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he just <em>bark</em>?\u201d Jackson chokes, a snort or two away from laughing. Stiles bares his teeth, provoked, but Scott chucks a pillow at Jackson\u2019s head before Stiles can embarrass himself further with another feral sound.</p>\n<p>Good ol\u2019 Scott.</p>\n<p>With a little leap, Stiles drops down to the floor from the couch. He makes a purposely threatening noise as he passes by Jackson, mutters something about potentially having rabies and not being afraid to test it on the boy, then skips out of the room before Jackson can take a swing at him.</p>\n<p>As soon as he\u2019s clear, he hears Allison tell Jackson that he\u2019s an asshole, and he can tell by the way he hears fabric shift that Jackson\u2019s only real response is to shrug.</p>\n<p>Stiles still isn\u2019t sure why they didn\u2019t just sacrifice him.</p>\n<p>Making his way up the steps a few at a time, Stiles turns to head to his little pile of blankets in Erica and Boyd\u2019s room, when the sound of typing makes his ears twitch. Everyone was downstairs except for Derek and Lydia, and the shower running down the hall in the master bedroom tells Stiles exactly who it is. He follows the rapid taps to Derek\u2019s door as he expected, sticking his nose in the crack and pushing it open.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look up from the computer he\u2019s working on, but his fingers slow over the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey get sick of you already?\u201d he asks dryly, clicking to a browser tab with some kind of foreign language on it. Stiles snorts, approaching the desk with curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got sick of <em>them,\u201d</em> he answers, standing up on his hind legs to rest his paws on the corner of the desk. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d he wonders, arching his head to see the screen.\u00a0 The language doesn\u2019t get any easier to read up close. He notices a window blinking in the taskbar.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing if any of my contacts from up north have any idea how to make you look less ridiculous,\u201d Derek retorts, glancing at Stiles from the corner of his eye. Stiles lets the dig go, instead focusing on the more interesting part of that sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Contacts\u2019?\u201d he grins, jumping up so that he\u2019s perched fully on the desk. He leans forward into Derek\u2019s space. \u201cDude. <em>You</em> have <em>contacts</em>? Like have your people call my people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy people <em>are </em>your people,\u201d Derek grunts, lifting a hand to shove Stiles\u2019 snout away. \u201cWhen Peter moved up there, he got involved with the supernatural community and they\u2019ve got more than just werewolves. They might know something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pauses, looking between the screen and Derek. He repeats the motion a few times, then makes what he thinks might be a foxy sound of amusement, and smoothly slips into Derek\u2019s lap before the man has a chance to react.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared, you big burnt marshmallow,\u201d he preens, shifting so that he can easily see the monitor.\u00a0 He knows Derek is rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou peed on my jacket,\u201d Derek responds blandly, but he doesn\u2019t try to force Stiles off of him. Instead, he clicks on the blinking tab where Stiles sees someone has sent Derek a list of links waiting to be searched. \u201cI want you human as soon as possible so I can punch you and not feel bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh, sure sure,\u201d Stiles says, eyes scanning the list of links. \u201cDo that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpecific would be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs and reaches a paw out to awkwardly move the mouse so that the cursor is hovering over the link he wants.\u00a0 Derek bats his paw away and clicks.</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that Derek is just tired of researching when he basically hands Stiles the reins an hour later, letting the fox decide what to search for and what to select as he acts as Stiles\u2019 hands.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t get much closer to any solid results, but Stiles feels a little less useless than he had lying on the couch.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll take what he can get.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d Scott murmurs, already half asleep, as Stiles uses his teeth to drag his blankets into the room; his fox excuse did little to prevent him from being sexiled by Boyd and Erica. His voice is muffled from the sheets, but he\u2019s pretty sure Scott gets the message that his answer is an irritated negative.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething will turn up, man.\u201d Scott sounds less certain and more close to passing out, so Stiles doesn\u2019t take much stock in what he says.</p>\n<p>Allison comes out of the bathroom, smelling clean and minty. She takes the blankets from Stiles, placing them on the room\u2019s sofa chair, and makes a comfortable nest out of them. Stiles feels his tail wag, pleased.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t get rabies,\u201d he promises, unable to help himself from leaning into her fingers scratching his chin. She chuckles and wishes him goodnight, then steps over to the bed.</p>\n<p>Stiles hops onto the chair, snuggles into the blankets, and tries to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The birds wake Stiles again, obnoxious chirping long before the sun rises.\u00a0 Scott is snoring and Allison is curled next to him, breathing soft and steady.\u00a0 Carefully, he makes his way off the couch and through the cracked open door.\u00a0 It was Isaac\u2019s turn to leave food for him last night, so he\u2019s sure there\u2019s water and some dry cereal down there waiting for him in those stupid bowls. He creeps down the steps as quietly as possible in a house full of werewolves and pauses when he hears noise from the kitchen. He sniffs the air, the scent of lavender shampoo hitting him. As he wanders into the kitchen, he finds Erica sitting on the island as he expected, munching on a few crackers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, cutie,\u201d she grins when she sees him. Stiles rolls his eyes at the name she\u2019s taken to calling him, making his way to his food bowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not cute,\u201d he mutters, between licks of water. \u201cI\u2019m a lean, mean, fighting machine. Rawr.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course you are,\u201d she patronizes, pushing off the stool to kneel beside him. Her sharp nails dig into the skin of his back and his body shudders involuntarily in pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking bite you,\u201d he growls in irritation. She laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she says, using both hands to give him a good rub down.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t sure how he ends up lying on the floor with his belly exposed to Erica\u2019s scritches \u2013 it\u2019s possible he blacked out \u2013 but she knows just where to hit and it\u2019s so much easier for Stiles to just go with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he grunts, foot thumping obscenely against the ground. \u201cJust don\u2019t start cooing.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The face looking back at Stiles is orange and fuzzy, something he doesn\u2019t think he will ever get used to seeing reflected. Baring his teeth reveals four fangs that melt off into jagged little mountains toward the back of his jaw and, after spending the last part of his life surrounded by werewolves, they\u2019re not very impressive. He snarls at the mirror, just to see what kind of shape his face makes.</p>\n<p>\u201cScary!\u201d Isaac shouts as he passes by the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, go fuck yourself!\u201d Stiles returns with mock cheer.\u00a0 Scowling, he leans forward and opens his mouth to let his breath fog up the glass. When the mirror is sufficiently cloudy, he uses his nose to draw a poor approximation of a human face.\u00a0 Sitting back and looking at it just makes him feel worse.</p>\n<p>His ears twitch at the sound of hushed human voices, the murmur somehow louder and more distinct than the previous tones of casual conversation. Curious, he drops from the bathroom sink and lightly treads along the hallway to the top of the staircase, pausing when he's able to make out the noise more clearly.</p>\n<p>\"There has to be more that we can do,\" Scott is muttering, sounding almost like he's having as hard of a time as Stiles is with the new situation. Stiles gives him bro-points for the sympathy pains. Lydia clicks her tongue and huffs.</p>\n<p>\"We've gone to the local libraries, where I have <em>personally</em> poured over everything we've found. We have Deaton and the resources in New York working on it, and Derek's trying, too. I'm not sure what you think we can do unless you want us to all pile into the Mystery Machine and travel accross the country looking for answers.\"</p>\n<p>Scott grunts a a weak affirmation and the disheartening news is not exactly the way Stiles had hoped that conversation would end.</p>\n<p>Still, he does have to admit that he'd make an awesome Scooby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles has learned two very important things over the past three years about Allison Argent, and both are directly related to each other:</p>\n<p>Boyd, in spite of the incident several years ago when Allison nearly shot him to death, is currently failing to keep those things in mind. He smirks as he knocks her Jigglypuff off the virtual island in Super Smash Bros. for the final time, resulting in his victory.</p>\n<p>She smiles, nods, bites her bottom lip a little, and says, \u201cOkay, I think I understand now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles buries his head in Scott\u2019s shoulder for their next round, because managing his second hand embarrassment was never something he was good at.</p>\n<p>Over the cursing and laughter, Stiles hears heavy footsteps trekking up the stairs. With Boyd losing his dignity in front of the TV, Stiles realizes that it must be Derek, the only other person in the house with such a weighted gait. He moves away from Scott and jumps off the couch, trotting over to the stairs.</p>\n<p>When he gets there, he can still smell Derek in the air. He takes the steps two at a time and doesn\u2019t bother doing anything else but unceremoniously barging in.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s just on the computer, the TV on in the background, and it\u2019s a little bit of a letdown that he didn\u2019t catch Derek doing something embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d Derek asks without taking his eyes off the screen, and Stiles realizes that Derek probably heard him coming when his paw touched the first step. Being a fox apparently doesn\u2019t mean that Stiles is any closer to getting the jump on Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doing more research?\u201d he wonders, hopping over to the desk. The page on display is in the same strange language.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek retorts, clearly lying. Stiles scoffs, leaping onto the desk and then down into Derek\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout me? I am wounded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Even though the words are spoken gruffly, it\u2019s an idle threat. Derek merely shifts so that there\u2019s enough room for Stiles in front of the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what news are your \u2018contacts\u2019 giving today, huh? A recipe for woodland creature stew? The weather updates from Narnia?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek snorts. \u201cCloudy with a chance of annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up at him and grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know just how to flatter a girl, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles tries sleeping in Isaac\u2019s room again, on the spare bed that had been his initially.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t work. The restless movements from Isaac\u2019s side of the room keep him awake, his ears too sensitive to let the sounds go.</p>\n<p>He jumps off the bed and quietly exits the room, searching for a door that\u2019s open enough that he can sneak in.</p>\n<p>The only room that becomes a potential option is the master bedroom, and as amusing as Jackson\u2019s expression would be when he wakes up covered in fox hair, right now Stiles wants as little to do with Jackson as possible.</p>\n<p>Making a frustrated noise, he meanders down the stairs and heads to the couch.</p>\n<p>He feels lonely and a little cold, but at least it\u2019s quiet.</p>\n<p>He wakes up covered with a blanket and he\u2019s not sure where it came from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br><img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB02-fox-redeux2.jpg\" alt width=\"500\" height=\"296\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles.</em>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun is filtering through the trees in the backyard, creating patterns of branches and leaves that Stiles watches as they change in the wind. The porch is warm underneath him and he can hear the laughter of Erica and Lydia by the lake. Blowing out a heavy breath of air, Stiles lowers his head to rest on his paws.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what really sucks?\u201d he asks Scott, glancing over to his friend. Scott is in the middle of trying to piece back together a water gun he accidentally broke yesterday.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, man?\u201d he asks distractedly, tongue peeking out between his lips. Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorld hunger,\u201d he says flatly, staring at the boy. Scott doesn\u2019t look up, just makes a sound feigning interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has been friends with Scott for way too long to be fooled.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dumbass,\u201d he snaps, jumping to his feet. \u201c<em>Being a fox</em> really sucks. Jesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does get Scott to glance up, his expression apologetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, dude,\u201d he says, pausing only briefly before going back to his gun. He at least sounds like he means it.</p>\n<p>Huffing, Stiles circles around Scott, watching him as he works.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re even trying,\u201d he mutters. He throws himself dramatically onto his side and sulks. \u201cAllison and Lydia are going to kick your ass, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can at least take down Jackson and Erica,\u201d Scott reasons, messing with a screw. \u201cMaybe Boyd and Isaac.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, man,\u201d he counters, already knowing how their water gun war will play out. \u201cLydia will be teaming up with Jackson until she takes out everyone else. And then, like the master assassin she is, she\u2019ll turn on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott hums in thought, pursing his lips as he studies the pieces of his gun. With a small grin, he moves his gaze to Stiles, who perks up instantly at the mischievous edge to his best friend\u2019s expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d he whispers conspiratorially. Stiles pushes himself onto his feet with renewed enthusiasm, bouncing on his paws.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally, you\u2019re-ah talking some-ah sense,\u201d he says in an over exaggerated Italian accent. He\u2019s not really sure what he\u2019s going for, and neither is Scott, but they don\u2019t question it. Instead, they delve into strategy.</p>\n<p>Two hours later, when the war officially begins, Derek sits down next to him on the porch.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy money\u2019s on Lydia,\u201d Stiles offers, munching on the piece of watermelon Scott brought out for him. Derek makes a noncommittal sound, which Stiles sees as encouragement to keep going. \u201cAllison\u2019s got better aim, obviously, but she\u2019s probably going to overestimate or underestimate exactly where the water will go. Not as predictable as bullets. Lydia probably did all the calculations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek remains silent, but when Stiles glances up at him, he\u2019s got his head tilted toward Stiles even as he watches the pack race around the trees ahead. Stiles thinks that means maybe he\u2019s listening.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, I know you werewolves have got the speed thing going for you, but, dude, Scott can\u2019t shoot for shit, and Erica\u2019s not that great either. Boyd and Isaac at least know how to shoot real guns.\u201d</p>\n<p>A snort comes from Derek and Stiles frowns, looking over at him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he glowers. Derek shakes his head, leaning back on his hands. His lips are pursed, fingers drumming against the wood of the porch.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy own personal sports commentator,\u201d he says dryly, cocking an eyebrow in Stiles direction.</p>\n<p>Whipping Derek with his tail, Stiles mutters, \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>The battle ends exactly the way Stiles expected it would: Lydia betraying her boyfriend for an easy path to victory. Allison is a close third, an epic upside down attack from a tree branch earning her MVP status, and Scott actually makes it past Boyd thanks to Stiles\u2019 help. Isaac gets him in the end, though.</p>\n<p>By the time the group is making their way back to the house, all dripping with water except for Lydia, the sky is turning orange and pink and Stiles can hear the crickets waking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I were in there, it\u2019d totally be me and Lydia at the end,\u201d he says confidently, gnawing at the residual watermelon rind. \u201cI\u2019d kick so much ass. Take out Jackson guerilla-style so she\u2019d have no one to protect her. Man, it\u2019d be awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the images run through his mind, Stiles feels a faint bite of regret; he\u2019s sure once he\u2019s turned back into a human, he\u2019ll have a few more chances to participate in things like water gun fights \u2013 maybe. But this summer was meant to be about them all being together before college tore them apart, and Stiles hates that he\u2019s missing even a second of it.</p>\n<p>He tries to ignore the depressing thoughts and looks over to Derek for a distraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d make it farther than Isaac,\u201d he muses, going over the various scenarios in his head. Derek\u2019s the fastest and the best at stealth \u2013 even in the middle of the day \u2013 so there\u2019s no question that he would last the longest of the werewolves. Derek can also shoot, was taught by the Argents themselves, so he\u2019d be good on the offensive end as well. But Allison would probably catch him off guard; he\u2019d get cocky, she\u2019d use Lydia as a distraction and then do her move popping out from some fucking tree to soak his ass.</p>\n<p>Derek snorts again, which Stiles chooses to take as a sound of agreement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything going good?\u201d Stiles\u2019 father asks over the phone a day later. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard much from you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott is holding the cell up to Stiles\u2019 head, balancing it in just the right position where Stiles can speak into it clearly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah, dad,\u201d he replies, forcing out a casual laugh. \u201cEverything\u2019s going great. You should see Lydia in a bikini, she\u2019s like\u2014SHIT!\u201c Expectedly, something gets thrown at him for the almost remark. Unexpectedly, it\u2019s much more painful than he\u2019d anticipated. When he looks down he sees that it was Lydia\u2019s stiletto.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d the Sheriff says, concerned. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, fine. It\u2019s just raining shoes over here, you know how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p>\n<p>They talk for a short while longer, Stiles trying not to make his father suspicious by hanging up too quickly. As the Sheriff finally gets off the line, telling him to have fun, Stiles lets out a heavy breath of air.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, dad,\u201d he says depreciatingly to the dial tone, \u201cyour only child is a fox at the moment. No, no, yeah, I know.

Stiles listens as several plates are slid onto the wood and the bacon continues to sizzle on the stove.</p>\n<p>With a yip, Stiles drops down from the windowsill to race into the kitchen, making it there just as Boyd is pulling the bacon from the pan. He separates a few pieces into a bowl and slides the rest onto a larger platter.</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t find himself too disappointed that he\u2019s eating out of a bowl on the ground when it\u2019s filled with breakfast meat. He munches happily as everyone talks at the table, nestled in by Scott\u2019s feet. Far too soon, Stiles is left licking the bowl for the grease and last few crumbs and he can still smell uneaten bacon on the table above him.</p>\n<p>Stealthily, he creeps away from Scott, moving around until he\u2019s located the perfect angle. He slowly raises his head, peering over the edge. The bacon is only a few inches away from his snout, on the empty side of the table where all of the food has been placed. As he opens his mouth, slants his head to grab a piece, he freezes, feeling a steady gaze on him.\u00a0 Jaw still open, Stiles\u2019 eyes move directly across the table, finding Derek watching him with a cocked brow. Everyone continues talking around them.</p>\n<p>Unsure of how to take Derek\u2019s silence, Stiles cautiously continues his task, peering at Derek the entire time, even as his jaws close over a slice of bacon.</p>\n<p>Derek goes back to the newspaper article he was reading.</p>\n<p>Stiles is victorious until Lydia catches him and smacks him in the back of the head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mirror never lies; it\u2019s something Stiles figured out the hard way when he was going through puberty. The mirror tells the ugly truth, no matter how painful it is, in clinical, glaring detail.</p>\n<p>Currently, the mirror is telling Stiles that he actually is kind of adorable.</p>\n<p>And that he is still a fox.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles learned early on that being wet when covered in fur was nowhere as fun as being dry, despite Lydia\u2019s attempts to convince him that foxes love water. He also learned early on that all of his friends are dicks who find it hilarious to use their wolfy strength to throw a poor little fox-human into the lake while they\u2019re swimming.</p>\n<p>Which is why Stiles finds himself alone in the house, while everyone else is down by the water instead of hunting for ways to fix him. Lydia was right when she said that they\u2019ve got their resources working on it, that there\u2019s not much <em>they</em> can physically do until they hear back from Deaton or Peter - that they can\u2019t possibly go home without Stiles being human or their parents will definitely ask questions. The witch is gone, her burial ground is gone, and no amount of screaming or shouting for her has brought her back.</p>\n<p>Stiles knows all of this, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from feeling bitter.</p>\n<p>Skulking to the guest bathroom, Stiles pokes his nose through the door crack and pushes it open.\u00a0 His feet pad against the tile in the spacious room as he circles around the shower and heads toward the laundry basket. With a leap he\u2019s inside, curling up to nestle into the towels.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s kind of gross with them all being dirty, but they\u2019re just towels, and they smell like his friends.\u00a0 And as much as his friends are giant assholes, the scent of being surrounded by them makes him feel secure when he\u2019s got no one to snuggle up to.\u00a0 He blames his delicate fox sensibilities.</p>\n<p>Lydia just blames him when she pulls out chunks of red fur from the lint filter, Jackson bitching that the guest bathroom always smells like fox now, as if it\u2019s not entirely his fault.</p>\n<p>Huffing, Stiles rests his chin on his paws, nosing at a towel that smells like Scott. The basket\u2019s been emptied recently, so he can fit himself in with enough room to feel like he\u2019s hidden in a hole, and he closes his eyes to enjoy his private little space.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s startled awake by the sound of the shower running and a towel being thrown on top of him. It smells like a combination of Derek, sweat, and lake water, and when the shower door closes with a rattle, Stiles knows exactly what\u2019s happening. The problem, he guesses, with the bathroom always smelling like fox is that the bathroom <em>always</em> <em>smells like fox</em>, and so Derek must have no idea that he\u2019s actually in here.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t curse, just awkwardly moves around so he\u2019s not being suffocated by Derek\u2019s towel and tries not to make any noise that wouldn\u2019t be drowned out by the falling water.\u00a0 As long as he stays hidden, he can avoid an awkward moment for both of them.</p>\n<p>His plan is hit with a fatal flaw when, just around the time Stiles is wondering what could possibly be taking Derek so long, he hears a soft hitch in Derek\u2019s breath, sensitive ears picking up the sound.\u00a0 His first thought is that he just imagined it, or that maybe the water got too cold. When he hears another hitch in breath, his second thought is that, while the idea of Derek being an angsty shower crier makes perfect sense, the guy has been surprisingly good-humored lately (for him) and Stiles knows that Derek is terrible at hiding it when something is bothering him.</p>\n<p>Curiosity overpowers his need to stay hidden, and Stiles peeks over the lid of the basket. He\u2019s able to see just into the shower, through the glass door, that Derek facing away from him into the spray. When Stiles catches the repetitive motion of Derek\u2019s right arm, the elbow bent just so, he wishes he were human again so he could smack himself in the face for not going with the obvious option.\u00a0 He ducks down into the basket, feeling warm all over from embarrassment, the fur making it all the more uncomfortable.\u00a0 The breaths continue, still hitching, like Derek is trying so hard to be quiet, but Stiles can hear every choked back whimper.\u00a0 Stiles wonders if that means that Derek is usually loud, usually doesn\u2019t hold back. His mind wanders, because it\u2019s not as if he hasn\u2019t noticed Derek is stupidly attractive, but getting turned on as a <em>fox </em>is not something Stiles has ever wanted to experience, so he tries to stop the thoughts dead. It\u2019s hard when the towel still partially on top of him smells like Derek.</p>\n<p>A stuttered moan escapes, still not loud enough to be heard by anyone but Stiles.\u00a0 He knows it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s totally wrong, but whatever Derek has started doing must be enough to make his throat emit those breathy sounds, barely stifled groans, noises that make Stiles think of porn stars trying to make it good for the audience.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no audience here but Stiles, and Derek has no idea.</p>\n<p>Shifting again, Stiles raises his head high enough that he can see just over the basket\u2019s rim, and he has to hold back his own whimper. \u00a0Derek\u2019s other hand has slid back to his ass, and this time Stiles has a perfect view of the way it\u2019s working forward and back.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a giant leap for Stiles to figure out what Derek\u2019s fingers are doing.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s legs are spread, his thigh muscles taut and tight as he tries to find the right angle. When he does, he makes a noise that is going to haunt Stiles for the rest of his life, then rises up to his toes, entire body tensing in pleasure.</p>\n<p>Squeezing his eyes shut, Stiles dives into the basket, burrowing deeper into the towels, trying to find one that smells like Jackson to balance out the visuals, the sounds.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t move until after Derek has grunted his climax, until after Derek has let out a satisfied noise,\u00a0until after Derek has gotten out of the shower and toweled himself off, until after Derek has gotten dressed and fucking <em>hummed</em> as he fixed his hair because of his great fucking orgasm.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t move until after the bathroom door opens and the door to Derek\u2019s room clicks shut down the hall. Then he jumps out of the basket, races outside and throws himself into the chilly lake.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s trying to cool himself off or drown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Allison laughs, rubbing him down with a towel.\u00a0 He feels like a dog, and if Allison keeps acting like he is, he\u2019s going to bite her.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lying to himself; she\u2019s one of his saving graces during this hell and she gives great belly rubs. That doesn\u2019t stop him from glaring darkly at her.</p>\n<p>She puts on a feigned, exaggeratedly stoic face and nods, continuing to dry his fur. \u00a0Lydia mentions something about a blow dryer and he swears he will contract rabies just to kill everyone in this house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, what are you doing?\u201d Scott wonders, eying Stiles warily as he refuses to look away from the ceiling.

Derek shrugs, taking in another spoonful, still reading.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo don\u2019t eat cereal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giving a little foxy frown (Stiles still isn\u2019t really sure how emotions work on this face), Stiles chances coming closer. He leaps onto the table, but stays on the opposite end, trying his hardest not to look anywhere near Derek\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want hot dogs,\u201d he says.\u00a0 It sounds like a demand, he thinks \u2013 hopes \u2013 and not like nervous wavering. If he notices, Derek feigns ignorance. He grabs a pen by his bowl, marks the page in the book where he stopped reading and stands to make his way to the fridge.</p>\n<p>Stiles does not look at his ass and he definitely does not wonder how he never noticed how fitted Derek\u2019s jeans were before. Instead, he distracts himself by padding over to the book on Derek\u2019s side of the table. It\u2019s in a language he doesn\u2019t understand \u2013 a different one from the strange text he\u2019s been seeing during his research with Derek\u00a0 --\u00a0 and there are old, sketched pictures of things Stiles can\u2019t really decipher. He realizes that it\u2019s not one of the library books at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d he wonders, pawing at the page. He can\u2019t really feel sensation the same way as he can with human hands, the bottom of his paws meant to be thick and strong enough to make even rocky terrain bearable, but he can tell the paper is at least thinner than the average page of a book.</p>\n<p>Derek shuts the door of the microwave, a beep following before the muted humming signals Stiles\u2019 food cooking. Stiles hears him come back to the table, doesn\u2019t remove his eyes from the book, and feels Derek <em>lean over</em> behind him, almost pressed against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter sent this. Thought it might help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles squints at the pages, does not wonder how Derek smells so good for someone always running around and maiming things.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat language is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dialect of a werewolf language,\u201d Derek says simply. Stiles eyes widen and he turns his head to stare at Derek, who\u2019s looking back at him with his brow raised challengingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so stupid,\u201d Stiles says anyway. \u201cWerewolves don\u2019t have their own language.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the beeping of the microwave, Derek straightens up and walks to the appliance. As he\u2019s pulling the hot dogs down onto the counter he says, \u201cHow exactly did you think we recorded centuries worth of our history without hunters, humans, or anything else out there finding it and being able to understand it?\u201d</p>\n<p>If he\u2019s being honest, Stiles has never really thought about it \u2013 the fact that werewolves are their own little secret society and probably have their own history, their own stories and views of the world that need to be passed on through each generation without any potential threats being able to discover any of it. It doesn\u2019t make a werewolf language sound any less stupid, but it does make more sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still stupid,\u201d Stiles reiterates out loud, stomach growling as Derek brings the plate of food over to the table. He sets the plate down at a seat next to his own, instead of the floor, and Stiles makes a confused noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not actually an animal,\u201d Derek snaps, \u201cGet in the chair and eat like a normal human being.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels like maybe there\u2019s more baggage in that statement than he really wants to examine on an empty stomach, so instead he hops off the table into the chair and turns around to face his meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Derek smirks, and Stiles rips off a piece of hot dog in what he hopes is a threatening manner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watching Isaac die repetitively while he tries to play Halo is actually physically painful for Stiles. He sits there in tortured silence for a while, bored as he waits for Scott to come back from getting groceries, but at a certain point, enough just becomes enough. Jumping off the couch, he trots to the space behind the entertainment system and, using his teeth, yanks out the XBOX\u2019s plug.</p>\n<p>Isaac shouts a cry of dismay as soon as the power shuts off, and Stiles proudly comes around to the front of the TV.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No,</em>\u201d is all Stiles says, before darting into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A cheesy romance movie ends up being on tap for the night, and, as completely clich\u00e9 as it is, Stiles ends up getting sexiled from every paired up room in the house. Isaac is not an option, with the first attempt having not worked out so well (and also because Stiles is pretty sure Isaac still wants to pound him for the stunt he pulled that afternoon).</p>\n<p>It leaves only Derek\u2019s room or the couch for Stiles to call his home for the night, and Stiles has long since realized that something in his innate foxy senses prefers company to sleeping alone in a wide open space. He\u2019s sure it\u2019ll be fine as long as Derek keeps his clothes on.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look surprised as Stiles slinks his way in, pile of blankets between his teeth, dragging on the floor behind him.\u00a0 He mirrors the pointed look that Stiles throws him in an attempt to get him to put Stiles\u2019 blankets on the chair, and doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get on the bed,\u201d Derek sighs, reaching over to turn off the lamp. In the darkness, Stiles can see clearly as Derek\u2019s form shifts under the covers and Stiles is pretty certain that it\u2019s not a great idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no, dude, I\u2019m fine-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek grunts, tone impatient. His voice is muffled by his pillow, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ever seen Derek sleepy before.\u00a0 Tired and exhausted is a given, but the concept of Derek being <em>sleepy</em> seems foreign, even though he\u2019s completely aware the guy sleeps. Maybe.\u00a0 \u201cGet on the bed. You\u2019re not gonna sleep on a pile of sheets like a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but sleeping at the foot of the bed like a dog is so much better?\u201d Stiles snaps, backing up to park himself challengingly on his little nest. Derek doesn\u2019t sit up, so there\u2019s no real effect. Stiles huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo don\u2019t sleep on the foot of the bed,\u201d comes the mumble.</p>\n<p>The stupid fox part of Stiles\u2019 brain makes a compelling argument for how much better sleeping next to a solid form that makes him feel safe sounds, rather than sleeping alone on the floor. The rational part of Stiles\u2019 brain tells him exactly how unsafe it is, but then traitorously adds that a bed is so much more comfortable than a pile of sheets on the ground.</p>\n<p>Huffing again, Stiles pads over to the bed and leaps onto it, Derek barely moving from the slight bounce Stiles\u2019 landing caused.\u00a0 Just to be a pain, Stiles avoids the foot of the bed and goes further north. He pauses at Derek\u2019s hip, realizes he does not at all want to wake up to Derek\u2019s crotch or ass in his face if Derek turns onto his side during the night, and bypasses it to Derek\u2019s back.\u00a0 He contemplates just laying himself on top of Derek like a cat, but the bed does seem pretty damn comfortable, and he\u2019s not gonna push his luck.\u00a0 So instead, he continues to move up Derek\u2019s body, and finally settles on stretching out next to Derek\u2019s bent arm, Derek\u2019s hands shoved under his pillow.\u00a0 Stiles drops his head on his paws, blinking at Derek\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek groans, eyes remaining shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just thinking that you look like Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Stiles quips with a snicker. Derek does open an eye at that, peeking down at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me,\u201d Stiles bristles, shutting his eyes even so.\u00a0 He hears Derek snort and flicks his tail in irritation at the man.</p>\n<p>Stiles sleeps better than he has since being human.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he wakes up, the first thing Stiles sees is Derek\u2019s face.\u00a0 It\u2019s still lost in sleep, there\u2019s an imprint on his jaw from where Derek didn\u2019t take off his watch, and Derek\u2019s hair is mussed ridiculously.</p>\n<p>Ever since Derek began letting his guard down years ago, allowed himself to let people in and trust, he\u2019s become fully human in Stiles\u2019 mind, rather than the sardonic human-like wolf robot Stiles always saw him as. He still has some walls, still tries to put up a rough exterior, but he\u2019s become human to Stiles nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Now, Derek looks touchable in a way Stiles hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to experience.</p>\n<p>Not in the pervy sense that Stiles does not at all want to think about; he looks accessible, like someone who is going to wake up and smile and laugh and have a conversation and not feel like he\u2019s on some other plane of existence that Stiles will be able to catch glimpses at, but never quite reach.</p>\n<p>When Derek\u2019s eyes do open, they\u2019re bleary instead of immediately alert like Stiles would have expected, and it does nothing to hinder the mood.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at Stiles for a moment, mind obviously working though his expression stays neutral, and Stiles thinks the color of Derek\u2019s eyes when the morning sun is reflected in them is impossibly <em>stupid</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t crush you, did I?\u201d Derek croaks, voice throaty and raw from sleep (and also stupid). He asks it casually, like he\u2019s just making sure rather than being honestly concerned. Stiles shakes his head slowly, and with that Derek is sitting up and Stiles is suddenly glad he\u2019s covered in fur to hide the warmth he feels on his face.</p>\n<p>Derek yawns, runs his fingers through his hair, and glances around the room like he needs a moment to get his bearings. He probably doesn\u2019t, probably had this room and all possible exits and entrances, as well as everything that could be used as a weapon against him or by him, noted in his brain the second he walked in. \u00a0Something inside Stiles shifts when he wonders if maybe Derek is going through the motions because he can, because he knows he\u2019s safe, because he\u2019s not running, and because it makes those feelings real to him.</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that the first year they knew Derek, the barest creak from a mile away would have the man up and out of bed and ready to attack. \u00a0He\u2019s not sure why he suddenly feels guilty about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Stiles wonders, curling up even as Derek begins getting out of bed. \u201cYou begin your day with the blood of your enemies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek mimes a sarcastic laugh, grabbing his towel hanging from the back of the door.\u00a0 Instantly the images from days ago filter back into Stiles brain, and he hides his face in the folds of blankets.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, didn\u2019t you just, like, take a shower yesterday?\u201d he says, voice muffled in the dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of us take a shower more than once a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>The need to defend himself overtakes Stiles\u2019 embarrassment, and he sits up indignantly to retaliate. Derek is already gone.</p>\n<p>Stiles buries his face back in the covers.</p>\n<p>They smell like Derek and it doesn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s not that bad\u2026Well, I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely.</em>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tells himself that he can\u2019t hear anyone else moving around the house, that everyone else is still asleep, and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t leave Derek\u2019s bed. \u00a0Derek comes back smelling fresh and clean and Stiles does not look away from the TV he managed to turn on to see what kind of expression Derek is wearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis show will rot your brain,\u201d Derek snorts, and he sounds amused, ruffling the fur on Stiles head as he walks by.

Horror movies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like normal movies, Stiles,\u201d Derek drawls, tossing his towel over the back of the desk chair. He turns on his laptop, letting it boot up as he moves around the room to finish getting dressed. He puts a shirt on over his undershirt and lifts them both to slide on his belt. Stiles surreptitiously steals a glance at the defined hip bones that disappointingly get covered as Derek pulls his pants up and fastens the belt.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he challenges, looking away. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer, instead sitting down at the desk and logging in to his computer. Stiles gives it a minute, then realizes that Derek has no intention to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, are you avoiding the question?\u201d he laughs, jumping down from the bed so that he can leap up to the corner of the desk. Pursing his lips, Derek gives Stiles a sidelong glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding it. I\u2019m just not going to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man,\u201d Stiles cackles, the noise coming out as more of a hissing sound in his fox form, \u201cIt\u2019s something really embarrassing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He gets in between Derek and the computer screen. \u201cIt\u2019s My Little Pony, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018The Longer You\u2019re Obnoxious, The Longer You\u2019re a Fox\u2019,\u201d Derek says pointedly.\u00a0 Stiles pouts, hunching his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a buzzkill,\u201d he huffs. Derek rolls his eyes and slides his chair out, looking at Stiles expectantly.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, Stiles knows exactly what Derek just did in the shower and sitting in his lap seems more than a little awkward.</p>\n<p>On the other, Stiles loves researching with Derek because it makes him feel less useless.</p>\n<p>On the third hand -- which totally counts, because as a fox, Stiles kind of has four hands \u2013 Stiles just checked Derek out and didn\u2019t feel too bad about it, so he guesses certain sacrifices have to be made.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s the noble type, and all.</p>\n<p>Slowly, he slips down into the space between Derek\u2019s legs and maneuvers so that he\u2019s facing the computer.</p>\n<p>Derek scratches the back of his ear absently and Stiles isn\u2019t sure if he feels guilty or seriously fucked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB05-small.jpg\" alt width=\"600\" height=\"431\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They research for about an hour and a half, before Stiles gets an itch in his bones that he\u2019s beginning to associate with Derek and he needs to get away.

Erica echoes an affirmation and adds, \u201cGet the pink kind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need more Doritos,\u201d Boyd calls and Allison follows up with, \u201cSome fruit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson and Lydia are noticeably absent, the door to their room shut, and Derek makes no effort to go find out what they want.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to come with?\u201d he asks Stiles, nodding to the door.</p>\n<p>Stiles first instinct is to be offended; he\u2019s not a dog, he doesn\u2019t need to be taken on rides in the car. But when he considers the several instances where Derek has explicitly affirmed his position that Stiles is <em>not</em> an animal, the offer seems weirdly sweet, like Derek knows Stiles has been cooped up in the house and wants to give him a chance to get out.</p>\n<p>He gnaws on Scott\u2019s head again for good measure, then bounds off the couch and races pass Derek to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut this on,\u201d Derek says when they\u2019re in the car, shoving Stiles\u2019 red hoodie at him. Stiles hadn\u2019t even seen it in Derek\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m a fox,\u201d he laughs, \u201cFreeballin\u2019 all day and all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes, Derek turns the key in the ignition and the car begins to rumble pleasantly. Stiles\u2019 nose twitches as he watches the way Derek\u2019s neck becomes exposed as the man twists and arches to look out the rear window, backing the Camaro out of the long, curving driveway.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, exactly how long do you think it\u2019ll take before someone calls animal control on the guy with a fox in the front seat?\u201d Derek ventures with a mockingly conversational tone.\u00a0 Point to Derek, Stiles\u2019 mind supplies as he realizes that Derek might be right.\u00a0 The fact that Derek thought about it, had brought Stiles\u2019 hoodie just in the event Stiles wanted to go, makes Stiles feel kind of like when he\u2019s snuggled in clothes that smell like Scott \u2013 like he\u2019s obnoxiously warm and happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhhh, I see,\u201d he says instead of analyzing the emotion, or Derek\u2019s potential motives. \u00a0He uses his nose to find the appropriate holes and slips the hoodie onto his frame. The sweatshirt pools around him on the seat, the hood big enough that Stiles can barely see anything above his snout, but he guess he could probably pass for a normal dog now, so it serves its purpose.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that you\u2019re nothing but a pretty face,\u201d he quips, turning his head to what he thinks is Derek\u2019s general direction.\u00a0 Little pools of light come in under the hood, but other than that, it\u2019s darkness.</p>\n<p>Derek makes a noise that sounds eerily familiar to an actual laugh \u2013 no dry humor involved \u2013 and Stiles is at once disappointed and relieved that he can\u2019t see Derek to verify.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek is visibly conflicted, though he tries his best to hide it, when it comes to leaving Stiles in the car with the window cracked. Stiles understands, he can\u2019t go inside and leaving the car on would just attract attention. He promises Derek that he\u2019s not offended and Derek doesn\u2019t say that he\u2019ll be quick, but Stiles knows he\u2019s thinking it.</p>\n<p>He amuses himself by making everyone who passes by the car think they\u2019re hearing voices, speaking lowly when they\u2019re not paying attention, then panting like an innocent puppy, tongue out, when they turn around.\u00a0 One kid actually sees him, shouts to his mom that there\u2019s a talking dog in the Camaro, but of course she doesn\u2019t believe him. Stiles slides his paw across his neck threateningly anyway.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s back within fifteen minutes and Stiles can\u2019t say he\u2019s surprised; he\u2019s never met someone with as much focus as Derek.</p>\n<p>Also the guy has werewolf speed, so.</p>\n<p>As Derek opens the trunk and begins to load in the groceries, a middle-aged woman walks by, cooing at Stiles in the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, how precious he is in his little sweater!\u201d she squeals, hands folded up to her chest.\u00a0 She looks over at Derek. \u201cIs he some sort of collie mix?\u201d</p>\n<p>In the silence, Stiles can imagine Derek\u2019s blank stare before the man says, \u201cSure,\u201d and shuts the trunk with a snap.</p>\n<p>She smiles, stares at Stiles fondly, and Derek doesn\u2019t give her a chance to say anything else, briskly walking around the Camaro to get inside. As soon as he\u2019s in, the smell of food hits Stiles\u2019 nose, and he notices the bag Derek\u2019s sat in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Derek mutters, pulling out a plastic container, steam creating condensation on the sides. He opens it, releasing the scent even more potently in the car, and reveals a mass of steak tips, piled almost all the way to the top.</p>\n<p>Stiles gets that weird warm feeling again, blames the lack of A/C, and blurts, \u201cIt\u2019s poisoned, isn\u2019t it? You brought me along to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, nestling the container onto the seat in front of Stiles so that it\u2019s secure enough that it won\u2019t fall unless he breaks abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if you get any on my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snorting, Stiles ducks his head to bite at a piece, then sits up and turns his snout toward Derek to chew obnoxiously. He gets a hand shoving his face away for his efforts.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet inside the car as they drive, the only sounds being Stiles\u2019 munching and the low volume of the radio \u2013 a classic rock station, which Stiles decides would have been his first choice if asked what kind of music he thought Derek enjoyed listening to. The relative silence gives Stiles\u2019 mind a chance to wander, traveling to places and on paths better left alone. He lands on a specific thought, something that has been nagging at him in the back of his head for a while now, fixates on it until his mouth is working without permission.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, why are you being so nice to me?\u201d he wonders, licking the gravy from around his mouth. \u00a0Derek gives him a sidelong glance, then quickly returns his gaze to the road. \u201cI mean, not just this. All the researching and stuff. No one else is bothering to go that extra mile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one else can read werewolf,\u201d Derek retorts, taking a turn slow enough that he doesn\u2019t jar Stiles\u2019 food too much. Stiles still thinks a werewolf language is stupid, but he doesn\u2019t comment on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles huffs, because Derek is clearly avoiding the question. \u201cThen what\u2019s all <em>this</em>?\u201d He doesn\u2019t gesture around with his paw, because he doesn\u2019t want to risk knocking over the steak, but he thinks maybe his tone relays his meaning. While Derek doesn\u2019t speak, his fingers tighten imperceptibly on the steering wheel, and Stiles knows it has.</p>\n<p>The silence resumes and Stiles has long given up on waiting for an answer by the time Derek finally responds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like when people forget that you\u2019re human,\u201d he says flatly.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, it\u2019s Stiles turn not to reply, feeling the words twist like an ugly thing behind his ribcage. He tears at a piece of meat and swallows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even though it\u2019s Allison and Scott\u2019s turn to house Stiles for the night, and no one is actively trying to sexile him, Stiles follows Derek up the stairs when the man heads to his room. He slips in just before Derek closes the door, and Derek doesn\u2019t seem at all surprised when Stiles makes himself at home on the bed. \u00a0He turns on the TV and sets the remote down in front of Stiles, then moves around the bed to start getting undressed. Stiles flips to a random channel to distract himself from staring at Derek\u2019s slowly revealed body, not really registering what\u2019s on the screen until he hears Derek mutter, \u201cInconceivable,\u201d to himself in time with a voice coming from the speakers.</p>\n<p>He whips his head around without thinking, the shock enough to make him forget his original goal. Derek is just pulling on a t-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles gapes, not quite able to reconcile his thoughts in a way that makes sense to him. \u201cYou can quote <em>The Princess Bride</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek halts the adjusting of his shirt, eyes remaining glued to the hem for a long minute, like Stiles said some magic word and froze him in time.\u00a0 When he finally moves, his expression is pinched and Stiles does not miss the faint dusting of pink on Derek\u2019s cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura used to watch it all the time when we were kids,\u201d he mutters. \u201cShe loved it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can hear the, \u201cAnd so did I,\u201d in the way Derek\u2019s gaze avoids the TV, and is reminded of all the hours he\u2019s spent in front of <em>The Never Ending Story</em>, reminiscing about the times he would watch it with his mother \u2013 how it somehow made what was already his favorite movie even more precious to him.</p>\n<p>Nearing the bed, Derek reaches for the remote to change the channel, but Stiles knocks his hand away with his snout.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cNo, I want to watch it,\u201d he insists. He\u2019s not doing it solely for Derek \u2013 it\u2019s a great movie \u2013 but he kind of feels like he is when Derek looks at him in surprise, expression wary. \u201cIt features me, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Derek\u2019s stare goes blank, Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cYou know, R.O.U.S\u2019s? Rodents of Unusual Size?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFoxes aren\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>, shut up and watch the movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hesitates only for a second, before sliding into bed. He sits up against the headboard and pulls the blankets over his lap, leaving a space beside him that looks far too comfortable for Stiles to pass up. He bounces into the spot, the mattress shaking from the movement, and curls up with his tail around him. Derek makes a sound of amusement, fingers rubbing gently against the top of Stiles head.</p>\n<p>As the movie runs, Derek\u2019s caresses don\u2019t stop. Stiles eyes drift closed despite his efforts to stay awake, the attention mixing with the warmth he feels lulling him. He falls asleep to the sound of Derek\u2019s rumbling chuckles and the murmured echoes of lines from the film.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stealing bacon is much easier when he has an accomplice, Stiles realizes in the morning. The second his head crests the table, Stiles catches Derek\u2019s gaze. This time, however, the man doesn\u2019t just go back to reading the newspaper. Instead, he leans forward slightly and begins to ask Lydia \u2013 the closest to the plate of bacon \u2013 if she thinks she\u2019ll be able to work some of the spells in an old book Deaton gave her. She scoffs, turning fully away from Stiles and the bacon to lay down on Derek exactly how she\u2019ll be able to work <em>all</em> of the spells in the book.</p>\n<p>His friends are focused on the conversation between Derek and Lydia, totally distracted, and Stiles decides to go big or go home.</p>\n<p>Opening his mouth wide, he slides the bottom of his jaw under the slices, managing to shovel in the majority of the bacon before he snaps his teeth shut. Involuntarily, he makes a pleased noise, stilling when everyone looks over.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stiles</em>!\u201d Lydia screeches, reaching for him. He\u2019s too fast, bouncing off the table with his treasure secured, cackling as he runs down the hall.</p>\n<p>He turns a corner and slows, beginning to chew his prize.</p>\n<p>Derek has always made an excellent partner-in-crime.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB-bacon.jpg\" alt width=\"600\" height=\"307\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGrrr.\u201d Stiles wrinkles his nose, pressing the tip against the mirror.

That\u2019d be really anticlimactic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak it,\u201d he dismisses, like it\u2019s something that\u2019s supposed to be obvious. With a shrug, Stiles settles himself in deeper in Derek\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool. That makes it less stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious! Okay?\u201d he insists, \u201cI really wanna learn to read this bizarre wolfy language of yours.\u201d Dropping his head against Derek\u2019s chest, Stiles stares at the bottom of his chin. \u201cOr are my bicuspids not sharp enough to be worthy? Be honest, you can tell me if this new look isn\u2019t working for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leans up and nips at Derek\u2019s jaw in retaliation, definitely not thinking of how it\u2019d come off if he were human.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn idiot who will know how to read Werewolf,\u201d he agrees good-naturedly, awkwardly trying to elbow Derek\u2019s stomach. \u201cAh? Ah? Suck on that, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flicks Stiles in the ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he admits, shifting to sit straighter. It jostles Stiles, who tries to re-arrange himself without falling off. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tail smacking Derek in the face as he darts up, Stiles puts his front paws on the desk, excitedly leaning forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p>\n<p>A sigh escapes from Derek, tinged with a long-suffering edge to it, as he begins to explain.</p>\n<p>\u2018Werewolf\u2019 turns out to be a strange mix of pictograms and letters \u2013 or, if he\u2019s being specific, pictograms that <em>look</em> like letters. Letters that are some hybrid of Asian, Arabic, and Russian. Derek was right; it\u2019s complicated. Disguised as a fluid series of words in the traditional sense, each \u201cletter\u201d is actually a symbol with its own, specific meaning that changes depending on what it\u2019s grouped with.\u00a0 Hieroglyphics for a mythical race.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles guesses it really is a non-werewolf-proof way of concealing sensitive information, throwing off anyone who stumbles upon it. They\u2019d be sent in the wrong direction with almost any attempt to decipher the text, kind of like the text itself is booby-trapped.</p>\n<p>He has to give the wolves credit where it\u2019s due: It\u2019s pretty badass.</p>\n<p>Derek explains the concept of dialects, how it\u2019s similar to those of spoken languages; there are werewolves all over the world and sometimes symbols are drawn or translated differently.</p>\n<p>By the time the lesson is over, Stiles can make out the words \u201chunter\u201d, \u201chuman\u201d, \u201cwolf\u201d, and \u201cpack\u201d. He feels accomplished. Proud, even, when Derek sounds impressed.</p>\n<p>The sky has become darker outside the window and the finches are long gone. Stiles settles back into Derek, nestling himself into the crook of Derek\u2019s arm as it rests on his knee. He watches quietly as Derek continues to research, clicking on links sent to him by whoever is on the other side of the IM window.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that Peter?\u201d he hazards after a while, blinking as the bright illumination from the computer screen becomes the only source of light in the room, the sun setting fully outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek mutters distractedly, fingers moving quickly over the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Turning his face into Derek\u2019s arm, Stiles nuzzles into it, trying to hide himself from the monitor\u2019s glow.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him I hate him,\u201d he says tiredly.</p>\n<p>The fingers pause on the keyboard, and then Derek chokes back a laugh, something that sounds like he\u2019s genuinely amused but is trying not to be. If Stiles weren\u2019t so comfortable, he\u2019d be heading out the door to get away from the tickling warmth that floats down his spine at the noise.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just really comfortable, is all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A month passes and no one is any closer to finding a cure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying \"As you wish\", what he meant was, \"I love you.\"\u00a0And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.</em>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time Stiles gets sick from eating cereal, he thinks it must have been a bad batch. He stays away from it the rest of the day, nibbles on pieces of fruit Allison sets out for him, and has a few slices of the pizza they order for dinner. By the time night falls, he feels sluggish and achy, hot all over. He curls up with Scott on the couch, whimpering as his best friend scratches his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry you feel sick, buddy,\u201d Scott says, fingers moving down Stiles\u2019 back.\u00a0 It feels good, but as Stiles tries to shift closer, bury his face into Scott\u2019s thigh, it isn\u2019t enough. He whimpers again, just wanting the gross feeling to stop.</p>\n<p>Reaching across Scott\u2019s lap, Allison drops a reassuring hand on Stiles\u2019 neck. He appreciates the gesture, but it does little to soothe him.</p>\n<p>When Derek passes by a few minutes later, something tugs at Stiles internally and he lets out a pained whine. He hears Derek take a few steps back until he\u2019s behind the couch, looking down at the fox.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay,\u201d Stiles mutters, weakly pushing away from Scott to maneuver himself into the empty end of the sofa. Stiles keeps his eyes closed, he\u2019s not sure what \u2013 if any \u2013 looks are passed around between Scott and Derek. But within a few seconds, Derek is lifting him up and taking a seat on the cushions, holding Stiles in his lap.</p>\n<p>Some of the pain goes away, leaving him with just a tender feeling in his muscles instead. He nuzzles at Derek\u2019s hand, which obediently starts rubbing his back.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what it means that Derek can do this for him when Scott can\u2019t; he just knows that, in the moment, he doesn\u2019t want it to stop.</p>\n<p>He wakes up in the morning still feeling ill and it\u2019s decided that Derek will be the one to take him to see Deaton, Derek voted as the one most likely to be able to get in and out of Beacon Hills without anyone stopping him to chat.</p>\n<p>When they get into the car, Stiles doesn\u2019t get the hoodie treatment.

Stiles\u2019 feels distinctly violated after the examination.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew that cereal was bad,\u201d he mutters, laying down on the cold steel. Derek\u2019s fingers playing with his tail make it a little better.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Deaton agrees, putting away his instruments one by one into the drawers. \u201cIt was the cereal. And the pizza. And the brownies and candy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome again?\u201d Stiles says, lifting his head up enough that he can eye Deaton suspiciously. The doctor sighs and shakes his head, coming to stand next to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you\u2019re a fox now, as much as your brain doesn\u2019t think you are. And while you could get away with it at first, as your body becomes more used to being a fox-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs a diet for foxes,\u201d Derek finishes.

Derek\u2019s still got his fingers twisted in the fur of Stiles\u2019 tail.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two have bonded quite well during this,\u201d Deaton observes with a smile. Derek shoots him a dark look that Stiles doesn\u2019t really understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d Stiles shrugs, twisting himself so that he can bite at Derek\u2019s wrist instead. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t tried to throw me against a wall yet, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Deaton muses, something secretive in his tone. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re in any danger from Derek.\u201d He pauses and it seems like it\u2019s more for dramatic effect than anything else. \u201cAt least not in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up from where he\u2019s using his teeth to tug at Derek\u2019s shirt sleeve. He spits out the material to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you mean like he\u2019s gonna bite me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes,</em>\u201d Derek cuts in before Deaton can answer, glaring at the doctor warningly. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he means. Can we skip to helping Stiles not feel like shit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton\u2019s expression is smug for some reason, which increases the intensity of Derek\u2019s scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>It comes down to Stiles having to stay away from any processed human food, Deaton being lenient enough to allow Stiles to indulge once every few days if he can\u2019t hold off his craving. He gives Derek some vitamins and medication to help get Stiles on track and tells them to call in two days if Stiles isn\u2019t doing better.</p>\n<p>Stiles wishes that didn\u2019t imply that in two days he\u2019ll still be a fox.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t mind that he\u2019s adorable, he decides as he stands up on his hind legs in front of the mirror, tail wagging.</p>\n<p>There are worse things than being adorable.</p>\n<p>Like still being a fox.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pack is having another water gun fight and this time, instead of sitting beside Derek, Stiles is lying in his lap as they watch the group engage in mock warfare. There\u2019s this sort of restless sensation that feels a little like it\u2019s tearing at Stiles from the inside when he\u2019s away from Derek for too long, and Stiles could examine it but he won\u2019t. Instead, he just gives in and curls around Derek as much as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson\u2019s going to let Lydia trick him again,\u201d Derek predicts, letting Stiles partake in his new favorite activity of gnawing on Derek\u2019s hand. When a particular patch of skin gets raw, he merely gives Stiles a new area to mouth around.</p>\n<p><em>That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen</em>, Stiles wants to say, but he can\u2019t quite get the words out. He can feel the pulse of Derek\u2019s fingers, the rush of blood, and something like that sense of restlessness is wondering what would happen if Stiles were to just\u2014</p>\n<p>Derek winces, but doesn\u2019t jerk, doesn\u2019t even really make a sound. The metallic taste is already on Stiles\u2019 tongue before he realizes what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Jolting out of Derek\u2019s lap, Stiles stumbles away, horrified at what he\u2019s done. It\u2019s not bad, Derek just shakes out his hand and the teeth marks heal almost instantly; it\u2019s something a playful animal would do, which is what\u2019s making a repulsive shiver crawl along Stiles\u2019 back.</p>\n<p>Stiles is not an animal.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go now,\u201d Stiles says anyway, despite Derek\u2019s attempts at reassurance. He races back into the house, up to the guest bathroom, the room that always smells like fox, and hides himself in the towel basket. It\u2019s the one place Derek might not be able to find him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek is upstairs, Stiles can <em>feel</em> him, but aside from a concerned look Derek briefly threw him on his way up, he hasn\u2019t tried to initiate any sort of contact with Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t really sure if he\u2019s offended or relieved or thankful. Whatever he is, he\u2019s still acutely aware of Derek\u2019s presence even while sitting with Scott on the couch.</p>\n<p>Lydia drops beside him, pokes at his thigh, and he halfheartedly kicks at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop sulking,\u201d she demands, grabbing the remote from the coffee table to change the channel on the TV.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I was watching that!\u201d Isaac snaps. Lydia smiles sharply at him, waving the remote in her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes, Isaac sinks back into his beanbag chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sulking,\u201d Stiles grunts, turning his head into Scott\u2019s fingers as they scratch behind his ear. He closes his eyes and he knows exactly when Derek leaves his room to go to the bathroom. Groaning, Stiles rolls over onto his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she says, continuing to flip through the channels, lips pursed as she eyes the screen. Scott makes a few aborted movements every time she passes something he might be interested, like he thinks he wants to stop her, but then remembers who he\u2019d be going up against. Eventually, she settles on something about astrophysics on the SPACE channel that nobody wants to watch but her. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did \u2013 Derek wouldn\u2019t tell us what happened,\u201d she continues, \u201cBut you\u2019re overreacting because he\u2019s not even mad. So stop sulking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is only mildly surprised that Derek didn\u2019t mention the biting incident to the others; he didn\u2019t really think Derek would, figures it\u2019s not even a big deal for someone who\u2019s been shot by bullets and arrows on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The fact does nothing to make Stiles feel better.</p>\n<p>He sleeps at the foot of Scott\u2019s bed, tries not to be as fitful as he wants to be, and when he wakes up he\u2019s curled next to Derek, with Derek\u2019s arm creating a secure nest around him. He\u2019s not really sure how he got there \u2013 whether he sleepwalked or Derek came and grabbed him somehow without waking him up \u2013 but when he starts to shift, Derek cracks a tired eye open and mutters, \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles grouches. To show how begrudging he is, he waits all of three seconds before nuzzling his snout under Derek\u2019s chin and heeding the orders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one seems surprised when Stiles follows Derek downstairs in the morning.</p>\n<p>He hates every one of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Boyd had gotten Stiles a small, red ball as a joke, teasingly throwing it across the room and telling Stiles to go \u201cfetch\u201d. That had been several weeks ago, and while the angry claw marks on Boyd\u2019s thigh have long since disappeared, Stiles still gets a sharp pang of irritation whenever he looks at the ball.</p>\n<p>He also has recently started getting the urge to pounce on it.</p>\n<p>He watches with wide eyes as Allison absentmindedly uses her toe to roll the ball around on the floor in front of the couch, attention focused on the book in her lap. She pulls it in, then lets it go, the object travelling across the carpet. It doesn\u2019t get far, before Stiles leaps onto it, the plastic squishing between his teeth, his claws grabbing at it. He lets out a happy sound and his struggles throw him onto his back as he continues to attack the ball in his grasp. It slips out from between his teeth and goes flying and Stiles darts up to chase after it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to research fox mythology,\u201d Stiles announces as he gets into Derek\u2019s lap, the man only shifting to get comfortable under the new weight. Stiles peers at the screen and can understand only the word \u201chuman\u201d of all the text on the page Derek has up. \u201cI want to see what would happen if I became a werefox. Like, I wouldn\u2019t be affected by the full moon, right? I think that\u2019s pretty much just a wolf thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t argue with him, or tell him he\u2019s an idiot (which, to be honest, Stiles was kind of expecting); he just googles the requested fox mythology and allows Stiles to take the lead.</p>\n<p>Stiles figures he has enough to worry about without adding in Derek\u2019s new silent act, so he doesn\u2019t concern himself with wondering why Derek barely says a single word the entire time, and why his chest twists uncomfortably just from the aura Derek seems to be giving out. It\u2019s deeply pensive and distracted, like Derek can\u2019t even pull away from his thoughts enough to do more than go through the motions when Stiles asks him to type something or give the mouse a click.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t want to know, so he doesn\u2019t ask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles bounces around the kitchen, jumping up on his hind legs to block people from walking over him, get them to pay attention. He drops his paws briefly on the island, then pushes off the counter, darting back and forth in front of Scott as he tries to pass by.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna go outside!\u201d he yips, musical notes of the birds in the woods hitting his ear, giving him an edgy feeling of wanting to run, to <em>pounce.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you just went to the bathroom like an hour ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking his head violently, the motion moving all the way down his body, Stiles yips again, this time a more feral noise. His nerves feel constricted, like they\u2019re bursting with something powerful and itchy, and all Stiles can think is that the house is so <em>small</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no! I wanna go <em>outside,</em>\u201d he pleads, \u201cYou know, commune with nature. Paint with all the colors of the wind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone been giving the little guy sugar?\u201d Boyd chuckles, lifting Stiles up with a single hand. He tucks Stiles under his arm like a football, completely unaffected by the struggles and cries of indignation. Stiles bites at Boyd\u2019s bicep and the asshole doesn\u2019t even wince.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he just woke up like that,\u201d Scott shrugs, pulling out the apple juice now that he\u2019s free to get to the fridge. \u201cI heard him running around Derek\u2019s room when I got up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gnaws a line down Boyd\u2019s forearm, legs scratching anything he can reach as he thrashes and tries to get away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek finally sick of him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Using everything he\u2019s got, Stiles leverages his hind paws against Boyd\u2019s back and bicep, roughly yanking his body, wiggling to slide through the grip. He pops out behind Boyd, squawking as he tumbles into the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking a shower,\u201d he huffs, glowering at his friends upside down, the lower half of his body propped against the wall. \u201cHe can\u2019t get sick of me. You guys, I\u2019m adorable.\u201d He\u2019s finally come to terms with it.</p>\n<p>Flipping over to right himself, he chooses to ignore the incredulous snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, bro,\u201d Scott says as he approaches. He leans down to scratch at the top of Stiles\u2019 head. \u201cAllison, Jackson, Lydia, and I are heading back to Beacon Hills for the day to meet up with Dr. Deaton.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles halfheartedly snaps his teeth at Scott\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause if we run into your dad,\u201d Allison cuts in, bending low to get down next to them, \u201cthen Scott doesn\u2019t have to lie to him when he says you stayed back at the lake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles splutters, feeling betrayed by the one with fingers of gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, hey,\u201d he objects, jumping up to his feet. He feels jittery still, like those days when he had taken too much Adderall \u2013 or not enough Adderall \u2013 before he switched to his non-stimulant medication; he wonders if maybe Scott put too much of his Strattera into his food last night. \u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s side are you even on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eyebrows raising the slightest fraction, Allison stares at Stiles like she\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s joking.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott\u2019s,\u201d she says flatly, the corner of her mouth quirking up. \u201cI\u2019m on Scott\u2019s side. Of course I\u2019m on Scott\u2019s side.\u201d With a laugh, she cups Stiles\u2019 face in her hands and pulls him up to place a kiss on the top of his head. \u201cNo matter how adorable you think you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s pretty adorable,\u201d Isaac adds with a smirk, totally unnecessarily, and Stiles will remember this when he has opposable thumbs again.</p>\n<p>Not that he can do much to Isaac even when walking on two legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen this is over, you can all lose my number,\u201d he grumbles, narrowing his eyes when Erica \u2018aww\u2019s at him. His ears perk up as the bathroom door opens upstairs, fur rustling over his body when the scent of Derek\u2019s aftershave reaches him.</p>\n<p>Everything happening in the kitchen is lost to him, as Stiles experiences a rapid surge of that same giddy energy, manic and coursing and almost painful. He races up the steps, arriving just as Derek\u2019s sitting on his bed to pull on his sneakers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna go outside!\u201d Stiles tries again, flying at Derek\u2019s feet. He gnaws playfully at the shoes, staring up at Derek with wide eyes, tail pounding the floor behind him. Derek does a terrible job at looking more irritated than amused, and Stiles knows he was right.</p>\n<p>He is fucking adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo go outside,\u201d Derek retorts dryly, batting Stiles\u2019 face away so he can tie his shoelaces.\u00a0 \u201cScott can take you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flops dramatically onto his side, then rolls over to gaze at Derek imploringly.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott is going out for the day! And so is Allison!\u201d Whimpering, Stiles ducks his head down, dropping his chin onto his paws. \u201cEveryone else makes fun of me and I might have to give them rabies. No one wants that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, with a surprising amount of patience, \u201cWerewolves can\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my goddddd, shut up and just take me outside!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late!\u201d Stiles cries, bouncing to his feet. He hops around the room, arms extending to pounce on every little object lying on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go outside and you have to come because there are things that eat little foxies out there and sarcasm is my only defense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>Cackling, Stiles bounds out of the room, breaking into a run. Erica is there to open up the door for him when he gets downstairs, finally consenting when she hears Derek calling his name and knows that he\u2019ll be safe with Derek coming after him. He barks happily at her and darts into the yard behind the house, racing into the growth of trees just beyond. It feels exhilarating, like something is cracking open inside of him, and Stiles can see and smell and breathe in the world and it\u2019s so different than it was before; it feels like this is how it should be.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for Derek to catch up with Stiles. He can hear the werewolf approaching, leaves and branches crunching, the heavy pounding of feet on the ground. Stiles knows he can\u2019t outrun Derek even if he tries, but he doesn\u2019t slow down, his gleeful laughter echoing as Derek tackles him, scoops him off the ground so that as they tumble and land he doesn\u2019t crush the small animal. Derek breaks their fall, grunting in discomfort, and Stiles can\u2019t stop laughing, blood still hurtling through his veins. \u00a0There are claws in Stiles\u2019 side, just on the edge of painful, but they don\u2019t break skin; even when lying on the forest floor, panting as he stares up at the tree canopies like he\u2019s wondering why whoever is up there hates him, Derek remains in complete control.</p>\n<p>Pushing himself up to his feet, Stiles crawls up Derek\u2019s chest, looking down at the man\u2019s face with a grin. Derek glowers at him, unamused, and all it does is tempt Stiles\u2019 limbs to break off into another sprint.</p>\n<p>As if sensing the urge, Derek wraps his arms fully around Stiles, pulling him down to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay,\u201d he orders. It sounds like a terrible idea, like it\u2019s the last thing Stiles wants to do, and he\u2019s just about to break away when he catches movement out of the corner of his eyes. Unbidden, every muscle in his body freezes, and he\u2019s not sure what\u2019s happening, except that it feels like what\u2019s supposed to happen. Everything shifts to autopilot, as Stiles lowers himself to Derek\u2019s chest, gaze seeking out the rabbit he can smell somewhere up ahead.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he hears Derek say fuzzily, the words slurring in his mind. He compresses his body, tightens everything together, and slips out of Derek\u2019s arms easily. He can hear the animal munching on thistles, knows exactly where it is by sound and smell alone. Silently, he maneuvers over the landscape, his paws landing just where he needs them to for him to avoid detection, nose dragging on the ground to keep on the correct path. \u00a0Twitching ears become just visible over blades of grass and Stiles straightens, the calculations already in his head, already answered for him, just how far he needs to jump, at what angle, at what speed.\u00a0 His entire body lifts off the ground as he propels himself at his prey, a high arc that lands him exactly where he needs to be, jaws closing in around coarse fur, a rapidly beating heart against his tongue. As he applies pressure, he hears bones crunch satisfyingly, tastes the still warm blood that coats his teeth. When the rabbit finally stops moving, when Stiles\u2019 tongue can no longer feel the heartbeat, he drops his prey on the ground and begins to tear into it, devouring bone and chunks of flesh that still taste like life.</p>\n<p>Soon, there\u2019s nothing left but a few clumps of fur in a mass of red in the dirt, and he\u2019s still hungry, still needs to hunt. His next potential meal comes in the form of squeaks from a short distance away, and his brain supplies him with the knowledge -- a small group of field mice, just beyond the trees. He dashes toward where he knows the mice will be, navigating the land with ease. He has the clearing in his sights when a massive wolf steps out before him, howling, bellowing, demanding that the fox turn back around. The fox tries to sneak by it, off to its side, but the wolf meets him there with a menacing growl. Its eyes flash red, raising the fox\u2019s hackles\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks, staring up at Derek in confusion as the man stands in full Alpha mode, eyes glowing, features morphed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d he croaks, wondering why it takes effort to use his voice.\u00a0 Derek instantly melts back into his human self, looking concerned and focused on Stiles in a way that fills the pit of Stiles\u2019 stomach with bile.</p>\n<p>His mouth tastes weird \u2013 raw and rancid and <em>wrong.</em> When his gaze moves down to his paws, he sees the fur matted with blood \u2013 blood that he knows is not his own \u2013 and it all comes back to him.</p>\n<p>In more ways than one.</p>\n<p>Derek gently runs his fingers over Stiles\u2019 back as he vomits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I a monster?\u201d Stiles asks weakly, eyes following Derek\u2019s every motion as he scrubs the blood from Stiles\u2019 paws. The scent of the soap is grounding in how human it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ate a rabbit,\u201d Derek mutters, running the rag under the water.\u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t massacre a village.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods sullenly. His stomach lurches and twists as he watches the blood coat the sink, travel down the drain. He thinks of the way the betas all tensed when Derek carried him into the house, could probably smell the rabbit\u2019s death on him, and thinks he might throw up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I an animal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s response is instant.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>After placing Stiles down by the kitchen sink more gently than necessary when they\u2019d arrived back at the house, Derek had demanded everyone leave the room and had then disappeared upstairs. When he came back, he was talking on his cell phone, a new tooth brush in hand, and Stiles could hear Scott\u2019s voice on the other end.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d wondered how hard it would be to shove his snout into the drain and turn on the garbage disposal.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I becoming an animal?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time Derek hesitates. It\u2019s only a split second, would be completely imperceptible if Stiles were human. But he\u2019s not, and that\u2019s the problem.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026No.\u201d It\u2019s not convincing, not with the underlying layer of concern. He looks back at the metal of the sink and does not wonder if the clump that just washed out of his claws was a residual piece of rabbit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I do, can I be your plucky pet fox?\u201d he says casually, trying to lighten the mood, if only for himself. \u201cI\u2019ll be an awesome pet. I\u2019ll learn tricks. I won\u2019t pee on things unless you\u2019re a dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you\u2019re not turning into an animal.\u201d More conviction from Derek this time, but Stiles is sure it has more to do with Derek\u2019s frustration than his belief. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles appreciates the attempt but\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but what if we don\u2019t, man? I mean, what if there\u2019s nothing we can do, and I can never go home and see my dad again, and he\u2019ll have lost his son, and I won\u2019t even care because in a week I won\u2019t even remember his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says firmly, \u201cWe will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is not in a place where he feels like being patronized, the idea of what would happen to his father if he never turned back, if he lost himself again, only just hitting him as he speaks.</p>\n<p>Ducking his head, Stiles meets Derek\u2019s eyes and says seriously, \u201cDerek. But what if we don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek holds his gaze for a long moment, then looks down, scrubbing harder at the darker red on Stiles\u2019 orange colored fur. It hurts, but Stiles doesn\u2019t wince, just stares at the way Derek\u2019s shoulders are tensed, how he seems like he\u2019s trying to get himself under control.</p>\n<p>Finally, Derek glances up, his eyes dangerous, his voice grim and flat when he speaks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIf we don\u2019t, then I\u2019m gonna find that witch,\u201d he promises. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is silent as Derek grabs the tooth brush and rips open the packaging, but his heart hurts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles feels physically cleaner once his mouth and fur have been scrubbed to remove all traces of his kill, but he\u2019s not sure the taste will ever go away.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a part of him lurking in the shadows of his mind that doesn\u2019t want it to and that terrifies him.</p>\n<p>All the jokes he\u2019s made about the werewolves eating cute little forest animals, crunching the bones of their enemies, are suddenly not funny anymore.</p>\n<p>He wonders if this was what Scott felt like when he turned.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as cool as he thought it\u2019d be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The pit of despair!

There\u2019s a foul pressure in his chest whenever he thinks of the wrath in Derek\u2019s expression \u2013 that the rage was on his behalf.</p>\n<p>So he lies down next to Isaac in front of the TV, listlessly telling him what buttons to press to get through the water temple in Zelda. Isaac follows his advice, probably feels sorry for him, but it\u2019s better than the concern and flashes of fear that Derek gets when he looks at Stiles.</p>\n<p>Up until now, Stiles had been confident that, even with the increasing moments of shifting into something more feral, he\u2019d still eventually return to being a human. He\u2019s never lost himself like he did today, though, and now the future is far more uncertain.</p>\n<p>When he thinks about Derek, he realizes he\u2019s never once toyed with the idea of what might happen between them if he were to become human again \u2013 not even when he\u2019d fully expected that he would turn back to normal. He figures he had probably assumed that everything would just translate to his <em>Homo sapien</em> form, that he\u2019d still harbor a stupidly awkward crush on the guy and do his best to ignore it and hope it went away. It should be easier when he\u2019s not constantly curling up to Derek, or nestling in his lap, unable to use the excuse of being a small animal anymore.</p>\n<p>He wonders if that means he\u2019d no longer get the glimpses into Derek that no one else sees \u2013 the laughs and smiles of genuine pleasure in quiet moments, the way Derek loves reaching out and having something living next to him to touch, the way he can quote a 1980\u2019s romantic comedy from beginning to end. He\u2019s never stopped to question if Derek was only letting his guard down so fully because Stiles was a fox -- something Derek subconsciously translates to \u201cnot human\u201d for all of his insistences that Stiles isn\u2019t an animal -- or if it was something about Stiles just being <em>Stiles</em>.</p>\n<p>He lets his mind wander to thoughts of what would happen if today was a sign of some sort of deterioration, if it means that maybe he can\u2019t be changed back after all, will eventually become fully wild. He swallows thickly around the feeling of nausea. If he doesn\u2019t get changed back, he can\u2019t go home, can\u2019t hug his dad, can\u2019t go to college, can\u2019t drive his jeep. There\u2019s a path that he allows his mind to follow that leads to Derek and it feels clearer, no more detour signs posted now that it\u2019s something that he might have a chance of losing.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to lose those glimpses, those secret moments of intimacy, the way he\u2019s so familiar with Derek\u2019s body that he recognizes his stupid deodorant. He doesn\u2019t want to lose the feeling of Derek\u2019s ribcage expanding as he breathes underneath him, the way his very human heart beats in a steady rhythm in contrast to Stiles\u2019 own slightly off kilter tempo.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so much easier to be braver, Stiles thinks wryly, when having the things you love ripped away from you is such an enormous possibility. But he does feel braver in his head now, where he's human again and he tells Derek how he feels, tells him all the ridiculous things he loves about him, tells Derek he can still flick his ears and pet his head and teach him how to read stupid mythological languages, but that he absolutely cannot just go back to being just a friend with no deeper connection than repeatedly saving each other\u2019s lives. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles learned the hard way that you really don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s missing from your life. And while, if Stiles stays a fox, he\u2019ll probably never know what he\u2019s missing, the thought of not having it, not ever having it, is enough to make him walk away in the middle of Isaac\u2019s game to go find Derek.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s passing through the kitchen when Derek comes in through the hall and stops short when he sees Stiles, keys spinning in his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d Stiles frowns, trying to hide his disappointment. Derek rolls his eyes and holds up Stiles\u2019 hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he corrects. Stiles instantly brightens, tail wagging behind him as he follows Derek out the door to the Camaro. Once he jumps inside, he obediently squirms his way into the sweatshirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shrugging, Derek starts the engine. He turns on the headlights, the sun fading in the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles mouths a silent \u201coh,\u201d Derek\u2019s response clearing up nothing; it\u2019s obvious the man has a destination in mind. Rather than worrying about it, he curls up in the seat and spends his time enjoying the way he can hear Derek breath, the sounds of classic rock on the stereo. Whenever he would drive with Derek as a human, their silence was always companionable; now it teeters on the edge of intimate.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to lose this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles has kept his head down for the majority of the drive, hasn\u2019t been paying attention to the turns Derek\u2019s made. When the car finally idles, Derek putting it in park, Stiles feels something sharp rattle inside him as he sits up. A block away is his house, the kitchen light on, clearly visible in the darkness.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh\u2026What-\u201c he stutters, turning to Derek for an explanation.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known that losing my family was a real risk the last time I saw them,\u201d he says simply, watching the Stilinski house. \u201cEven if it was just when I was watching my mom water her garden as we drove away in Laura\u2019s car.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t give Stiles a chance to speak, just reaches over and opens the passenger side door for Stiles to get out.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything feels so immense about what\u2019s happening; the sensation hurts, wants to claw its way out of his skin. Swallowing, Stiles nods, carefully slipping out of his hoodie and dropping out of the car. He turns to look at Derek over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna leave me are you? Like, this isn\u2019t just some plan to get rid of me so that someone comes along and tries to shoot me and\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a pointed look and closes the door on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, rude,\u201d he huffs. \u201cTaking the hint!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sticking out his tongue at the car, even though he knows Derek can\u2019t see him, Stiles begins his trek to his house. The streets are empty, no one around to spot him and call animal control or scare him off, and Stiles just hopes that remains the case. Still, he speeds up his pace.</p>\n<p>As he climbs up the steps of his porch, he hesitates, unsure if he really wants to do this. When he looks back at the car, he can\u2019t see anything through the tinted windows, but he knows Derek\u2019s gaze is on him. He has no way of identifying what the expression would be, but it\u2019s encouraging all the same. Nodding to himself, Stiles continues the way up the rest of the stairs, before creeping up to the brightly lit window.</p>\n<p>He peers over the edge of the windowsill timidly, hoping to whatever god is up there that his father isn\u2019t facing in his direction; he\u2019s not, distracted by Scott\u2019s mom as she cooks him dinner.\u00a0 They\u2019re laughing, having what looks like a date night, and everything aches at the thought of Stiles not having this again, of reaching a point where he doesn\u2019t even care. The lines on his father\u2019s face are warm, he looks happy, and Stiles has trouble breathing. He remembers what his father looked like when they lost Stiles\u2019 mom, remembers how broken he was. He doesn\u2019t want to think about the expression he\u2019ll be wearing if Stiles never comes home.</p>\n<p>He hears someone come up behind him, and by scent alone can tell it\u2019s Derek.\u00a0 A hand rests on his back, Derek quietly says, \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d and Stiles has to tear his gaze away from his window with the knowledge that it might be the last time he sees his father.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s glad he got the chance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB-house-small.jpg\" alt></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They head to the Hale house with bags of junk food, the first junk food Stiles has been allowed in weeks, and the area is deserted enough that they can sit on the hood of Derek\u2019s car without worrying about Stiles being seen. The stars are bright little pinpricks in the sky, even with the glow from Derek\u2019s headlights filling the area, and the familiar terrain makes Stiles feel a little less alien.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t thanked Derek for what he\u2019s done \u2013 not just tonight, but since this whole ordeal started \u2013 and somehow he knows he doesn\u2019t have to. For years, he and Derek have had the ability to communicate things without words, like Stiles can also do with Scott. He never realized how big it was that he could have that same kind of understanding with Derek.</p>\n<p>Maybe his interactions with Derek over the past few weeks hadn\u2019t come out of nowhere after all.</p>\n<p>Leaning over, he digs his snout into the bag on Derek\u2019s lap and emerges with a mouthful of curly fries, looking up at Derek guilelessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have your own,\u201d Derek points out, tone dry.\u00a0 Stiles shrugs, chewing obnoxiously. When he swallows, he licks his lips with purpose.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously yours taste better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Derek echoes with a snort. He moves the bag off his lap and places it beside Stiles, so Stiles will have easier access to it, then finishes up his burger in a few more bites.</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d he says as he stands, wiping the crumbs from his jeans.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust hurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs, but Derek\u2019s not acting like anything is wrong, and Stiles\u2019 foxy senses aren\u2019t tingling, so he\u2019s not concerned about any immediate danger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, cryptic is not a good color on you, dude,\u201d he mutters, before digging in to the remaining curly fries. He finishes both his and Derek\u2019s portions quickly, then jumps off the hood as Derek crumples up the trash. In a matter of minutes, they\u2019re back in the Camaro and Derek is driving the bumpy path through the woods, down to the main road.</p>\n<p>This time, Stiles keeps his head up and remains alert, trying to deduce their destination. It rapidly becomes apparent within a few turns. Deaton\u2019s office becomes visible in the distance and Stiles can see Allison\u2019s car parked outside.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a breathy noise that he hopes sounds like a sigh and throws himself back into his seat as they park.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you were trying to cue me into the fact that you\u2019d be into some bestiality. I mean dinner under the stars?\u201d He pauses, feigning thought. \u201cIs it bestiality if you\u2019re part wolf? Anyway, man, super disappointing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t really sure what kind of a reaction he was expecting from Derek after his crass remark, but he\u2019s positive the choked coughing fit wasn\u2019t one of the potential options.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Derek tries to growl, the effect ruined by his constricted throat.</p>\n<p>Stiles gleefully rolls down the window and leaps out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His good humor is hampered by the grave looks that greet Stiles when he and Derek enter through the waiting room. Even Jackson looks worried.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no fix, is there?\u201d he states more than asks, surprised by how easily it feels like he\u2019s accepting his fate. His dad will be all right; he\u2019s got Scott and Momma McCall. He\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Deaton counters. He sounds cautious, but there\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019s lying, so Stiles perks up. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we still have an unlimited amount of resources to consult, which was fine before but now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a timer on me?\u201d Stiles supplies, putting it together himself. Deaton nods and Stiles subconsciously shifts so that he\u2019s leaning against Derek\u2019s legs. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Deaton admits. He eyes the physical link between Stiles and Derek in a way that Stiles isn\u2019t quite sure he likes. \u201cIt could be days, weeks, months. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. It just means now we have a new sense of urgency, not that you still can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek must have caught Deaton\u2019s gaze as well, because he gets down on one knee to scratch reassuringly down Stiles\u2019 back as he listens, his expression suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to try something,\u201d the veterinarian announces, before he disappears into the kennel. Scott has just begun to move over to Stiles, when Deaton returns with a familiar face. In his arms is a German Shepard puppy, one Scott lovingly named Scout, who had taken a particular liking to the wolves of the group. Deaton places the dog on the floor by Scott, who looks confused by Scout\u2019s presence, but leans down to pet him anyway.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t really sure what\u2019s going on, but he watches all the same as Scout barks excitedly, rolls over as Allison joins Scott in giving the puppy love.\u00a0 Lydia extends her hand to pat at Scout\u2019s head, but keeps her distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Deaton says after a moment. \u201cWould you call Scout over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes are narrowed as he glares at Deaton, and Stiles knows Derek is aware of what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>He wishes someone would tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, boy,\u201d Derek says with gritted teeth, like the words are being forced out of him. He doesn\u2019t stop running his fingers through Stiles\u2019 fur, actually starts pressing in harder.</p>\n<p>Scout bounds over happily, gets up on his hind legs and licks a sloppy trail where he can reach the bottom of Derek\u2019s face. He drops his front paws on Derek\u2019s raised knee and wags his tail.</p>\n<p>Stiles is not any less confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, could you come here for a bit?\u201d Deaton asks, giving nothing away. Derek\u2019s hand freezes on Stiles, holding him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he hisses. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, what-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Deaton admonishes, but there is a threat layered in the name. With tangible reluctance, Derek pulls away from Stiles, who looks at him questioningly. The man doesn\u2019t remove his gaze from Deaton.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Hunching his shoulders, Stiles warily begins to make his way to Deaton. He\u2019s only gone a few steps when he hears Scout bark excitedly at Derek, his ears hone in on the sound of the mutt rubbing himself against Derek\u2019s hand, his leg.</p>\n<p>His hackles rise and he whips back around, growling threateningly at the other animal. The mutt yelps, tripping over himself to hide behind Derek, pressing in close. Snapping his teeth, the fox lowers himself to the ground, back arching to appear more intimidating, showing his intent. The mutt lets out a whimper and darts to the other side of the room, trying to find safety with the other humans. The fox gives a menacing bark, a warning, and circles around his territory.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lifted into the air, brought against something solid, and the fox struggles until he\u2019s hit with the scent of curly fries and Sprite.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his lungs expand and constrict rapidly, it\u2019s impossible for him to breathe. He gasps for air, feels like he\u2019s drowning, and panic attacks are not any more fun when he\u2019s not a human.</p>\n<p>Derek gets him to the examination table, keeps a comforting hold on him as Deaton slides an oxygen mask over his face.</p>\n<p>He can hear Derek yelling at Deaton, Deaton\u2019s calm responses, and Stiles just wants it all to go <em>away</em>.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want this stupid mask; he wants his inhaler, his human inhaler. He wants his dad and his mom and he doesn\u2019t want to hear the anger in Derek\u2019s voice because he knows he doesn\u2019t deserve for Derek to care that much about him.</p>\n<p>It hurts, everything hurts, and Stiles pleads for it to stop.</p>\n<p>It does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Stiles opens his eyes, Scott is looking down at him worriedly, scratching behind his ear. He\u2019s in Scott\u2019s lap, and when Stiles looks around, everyone else is gone. Tiredly, Stiles bumps his head against Scott\u2019s chest, stares up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison took Lydia and Jackson back to the lake. Derek is talking to Deaton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Stiles gets out, throat feeling thick and scratchy.\u00a0 Scott laughs, gives a careless shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly reason I\u2019m pretty sure it is, is because we probably need Dr. Deaton alive to fix you.\u201d Scott grins slyly. \u201cAnd Derek seems pretty invested in that, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Groaning, Stiles buries his face in Scott\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re talking about it.\u201d A pause and then, \u201cStiles, he\u2019s your anchor, man. That\u2019s some serious stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not my anchor,\u201d Stiles mumbles, finding himself meaning it despite his using it as a diversion tactic. Scott scratches behind his ear again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my anchor either,\u201d he reminds Stiles, sounding stupidly logical. \u201cWe\u2019re still best bros.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles breathes in deeply, his chest still aching. \u201cI\u2019m gonna stay a fox forever and die a fox. Still wanna be best bros with a dead fox? I\u2019ll start to smell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poking Stiles in the side, Scott laughs. \u201cWell, Deaton thinks that as long as you stay with Derek, it\u2019ll give us more time. He\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s probably why you\u2019ve still been you for so long. You\u2019re constantly all over the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a hissing sound. \u201cDude! I said I don\u2019t wanna talk about it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Scott says, not sounding sorry. Grumbling to himself, Stiles turns more into Scott, trying to block out the harsh light of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I think I hate <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man, that\u2019s totally a \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I will rip out your jugular and watch with glee as it heals so I can do it all over again. Like I\u2019m the king of your own personal <em>Dante\u2019s Inferno</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott has the nerve to chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drive back to the lake isn\u2019t as awkward as Stiles had anticipated it would be. The radio isn\u2019t off, the silence is only slightly tense, and Stiles feels more at ease with Derek at the wheel and Scott holding him close. He rests his head on Scott\u2019s shoulder and stares out the passenger side window, counting down the mile markers</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they get back to the lake house, the lights are off and everything is quiet. Once they step inside, Scott gingerly hands Stiles off to Derek, who takes Stiles with equal care, then seamlessly navigates through the dark house to head upstairs.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t follow, looks lost in thought like he has been since he stepped out of the operating room with Deaton.</p>\n<p>Stiles smacks Derek\u2019s shoulder with his head, snapping the man back to the present.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want anything?\u201d Derek asks with a start, stepping over to the fridge. Stiles shakes his head and throws his neck over Derek\u2019s shoulder, staring into the dark living room. He hears Derek open the fridge and pull something out, but doesn\u2019t really care much about what it is. He closes his eyes, ready for the day to end.</p>\n<p>Derek carries him through the house and upstairs to his room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do want something, actually,\u201d Stiles says just as Derek is laying him down on the bed. Derek hovers over him, looking concerned, always looking so fucking concerned lately, and a hysterical laugh bubbles out of him because when he thinks about asking for a kiss, just to throw it out there, he realizes that he\u2019s a fucking fox. He\u2019s a fox and Derek is at least mostly human and if Stiles stays a fox he will never get the chance to try and blame it on alcohol or exhaustion or the moment or a joke or whatever bullshit would eventually spew out of his mouth after he pulled away. Derek would stare at him, wouldn\u2019t believe him, and Stiles would dart away before he could get a rejection.</p>\n<p>Instead Stiles croaks, \u201cCan you put <em>The Princess Bride</em> up on your computer?\u201d</p>\n<p>From Derek\u2019s expression, he clearly believes that Stiles has cracked; he\u2019s closer to the truth than he realizes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says regardless, instantly moving to the desk so he can search for a stream of the film, of course he does. Because behind the gruff and tough and scary alpha act and the dry sarcasm and the silent manpain, he is actually stupidly fucking sweet. Stiles closes his eyes and congratulates himself for waiting so long to pick up on that little tidbit.</p>\n<p>He falls into a light sleep, only waking up when the bed moves as Derek slips under the covers. He doesn\u2019t open his eyes, had no plan to actually watch the movie. He just thought that if he\u2019s on a timer, if his days being conscious of his life and who he is are numbered, he\u2019d like to be able to enjoy the experience of being wrapped in Derek\u2019s scent while the memorable lines are spoken in the background.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Stiles wakes up in the morning, his first conscious thought is that he\u2019s still a fox. His next is that at least he hadn\u2019t escaped in the middle of the night to go live with his kind, cut off from civilization and modern plumbing.</p>\n<p>Derek is breathing next to him, still asleep, and Stiles is reminded every time he looks at the man of that great big fucking \u201cif\u201d.</p>\n<p>He knows so many things about Derek now. Things that are totally useless and mean absolutely nothing, but that Stiles still prays that someday he\u2019ll have a chance to take on the Derek trivia game and kick ass with his new knowledge. When he can wake up and pour Derek cereal that has way too much milk in it, remind Derek before he goes to sleep to take off his watch so it doesn\u2019t leave a mark on his face because he sleeps with his cheek pillowed on his hands, change the radio station in his jeep to classic rock whenever he gives Derek a ride.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always known that Derek is a good guy, learned that early on. From the beginning, Derek seemed to take his wolf powers as a gift; one that he felt responsible to use as a way to help people \u2013 any people \u2013 who were in danger, like some kind of hairy Spiderman. \u00a0Stiles has known that Derek puts everything he is into keeping those he cares about safe, making sure they\u2019re ready to take on anything that could hurt them. Stiles has known that sometimes Derek likes to sneak away and put on his sunglasses and drive a little too fast down back roads to release some of the tension.</p>\n<p>But now Stiles knows that Derek\u2019s trust is earned just by being quiet, by being a companion that doesn\u2019t judge him, that can sit with him when there\u2019s no need for words. He knows how brutally serious Derek is about taking care of people who rely on him, an exhausting amount of emotion put into it, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure how Derek has any of it left for himself. He knows how to tell when Derek is honestly annoyed and when it\u2019s just for show, just by the angle of his mouth. He knows that even though Derek has a laptop, he prefers using an external mouse for some reason, and that he can touch type unless he has to write out numbers. He knows the lines of Derek\u2019s hands, the scars on them that Derek doesn\u2019t talk about, because the only reason for them not to have healed is if they had been laced with wolfsbane. He knows that Derek\u2019s lashes touch his cheek when his eyes are closed and that he doesn\u2019t snore, but that sometimes he mumbles.</p>\n<p>He knows all of this and more and they mean nothing and they mean so much and all Stiles wants is a chance for this knowledge not to have been wasted.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s supposed to stay by Derek, it might be what\u2019s keeping him human, and Stiles uses that excuse to watch Derek as he sleeps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy.

Derek doesn\u2019t say anything about it, just rubs Stiles\u2019 head as he stands, and leaves to go to the bathroom. He comes back with his towel draped over his shoulder, and a tray of breakfast for the both of them.</p>\n<p>It actually physically pains Stiles that Derek didn\u2019t detour back to the room to drop off his towel after his shower before going downstairs to get Stiles food \u2013 that Stiles was that much of a priority.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really obnoxious, did you know that? Like, oh my god,\u201d he mutters, throwing himself back into the sheets dramatically. Derek purses his lips, raises his brow, but doesn\u2019t respond, most assuredly used to Stiles\u2019 dwindling sanity by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you so much,\u201d Stiles whines, trying to suffocate himself with a pillow that smells like the asshole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time they finally make it downstairs, everyone has gathered in front of the big screen TV in the living room for a movie. He and Derek had spent most of the day watching television, Stiles afraid that if he strayed too far from the security of the room, he would lose himself and not be able to change back. His fears are irrational, he knows they are, knows Derek thinks they are, but Derek never actually says anything \u2013 never even implies it \u2013 and wow, Derek is the worst and Stiles might take out a chunk of his face so that Derek knows how much it hurts for Stiles to want him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Derek make fun of people for less. Snort derisively, judge with a single glance. He doesn\u2019t want to think about what it means that Derek is being so generous in this case.</p>\n<p>Derek passes on the movie for the both of them and they head out to the porch, which Stiles\u2019 knows is Derek\u2019s way of telling him it\u2019ll be okay. They\u2019re outside, and Stiles still has the mind of a human, and it\u2019ll be okay.</p>\n<p>Stiles is reassured for the time being, but not convinced, as Derek takes a seat on the steps. Stiles follows suit, lying down in a way that allows his chin to rest on Derek\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>If it won\u2019t be okay, he thinks he should at least spend more time with everyone else \u2013 with Scott, and Boyd, and Allison, and Isaac and\u2026 just everyone. But as painful as the concept of losing all those little things he\u2019s grown to appreciate about Derek is, it pierces an even bigger hole inside of Stiles to think about having all knowledge of all of his friends ripped away from him. Lydia\u2019s shrewd smile; Allison\u2019s inner badass; Erica\u2019s love of corsets, leather, and Saturday morning cartoons. The fifteen years he\u2019s known Scott, known everything there is to know about him. It\u2019s so much easier to just avoid it all, feign ignorance on the situation and pretend, like Derek is pretending, that everything is going to be okay -- that he doesn\u2019t need to soak up as much as he can before it\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go be with them after the movie,\u201d Derek says to break the silence, because somehow he knows, of course he knows. And he suggests it like it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world, just like saying it\u2019ll be okay seems so easy for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they smell like fuckwaffles and assholes,\u201d Stiles mutters, glowering up at Derek, wondering if the man always knew him this well or if it was just a recent development from all the time they\u2019ve been spending together. \u201cAnd as a fox I have a very sensitive nose, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Derek says dryly, \u201cAnd what do I smell like?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Like your stupid deodorant, and soap, and the dark, and warmth,</em> Stiles does not say.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a douchebag.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCute.\u201d Derek flicks his ear and Stiles playfully snaps his teeth at the finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right, I\u2019m fucking adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>They haven\u2019t talked about it \u2013 Derek being Stiles\u2019 anchor. Derek is clearly aware of it, but he hasn\u2019t said anything, hasn\u2019t even started acting differently. \u00a0Stiles isn\u2019t sure what that means; he wonders how long exactly Derek has known. Evidently he had figured it out even before Deaton\u2019s little experiment, and Stiles isn\u2019t used to being the last to put the puzzle pieces together.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly sure how anchors work \u2013 he knows in the case of Scott and Allison, it\u2019s love. He\u2019s got an agonizing feeling that it\u2019s the same in his situation, and it\u2019s something he definitely does not want to think about. Not when he can\u2019t do anything about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura and I used to quote <em>The Lion King</em> as kids when we\u2019d lay outside the house at night,\u201d Derek offers, squinting up at the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cFireflies stuck in that big bluish black thing?\u201d Stiles grins, rolling over so that he\u2019s looking up at Derek, the back of his neck braced on Derek\u2019s leg. \u201cYou guys were big movie fans, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed out except for school until we were old enough to control our transformations. Had a lot of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches the way Derek\u2019s jaw sets, tight as he remembers his sister.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can forgive Peter for what he\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Derek snaps, and Stiles might hear the way the wooden step splinters from the grip Derek has on it. \u201cThe second he stops being more useful to have on our side than not, I\u2019m going to rip his throat out a second time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 probably not gonna happen,\u201d Stiles laments, fully realizing Derek\u2019s dilemma. When perpetually in a war with the world, you don\u2019t get the luxury of turning away allies.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek spits out, like the word is a foul taste in his mouth. Wanting to change the subject, do something to get rid of the tensed shoulders, squared jaw, Stiles sits up and bounces off the porch.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, speaking of fireflies, I bet there are some around here somewhere,\u201d he says with an excited hop. Derek raises his brow, but stands with Stiles, shoving his hands into his jean pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to go see fireflies?\u201d he asks skeptically. Stiles scoffs, prancing in a circle around Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a fox. I like to chase things,\u201d he says seriously. He stops behind Derek and headbutts the back of his legs to get the man moving. Derek takes a step forward, but doesn\u2019t go further than that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what we\u2019re trying to avoid?\u201d he says reasonably, and, yes, okay, it is. But Derek needs cheering up and somehow that seems more important to Stiles in the moment. He presses his head against the inside of Derek\u2019s knees again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t need your sass right now. I wanna go see the fireflies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Letting himself be pushed, Derek finally begins walking on his own, slightly behind Stiles, and lets Stiles lead him around to the back of the house. When Stiles looks over his shoulder, Derek is typing something into his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re googling ways to seduce a fox, man,\u201d Stiles says casually, \u201cJust get me more steak tips.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks a strange mix between horrified and completely unsurprised that Stiles would say that, but doesn\u2019t glance up from his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking up ways to bury the body,\u201d he says just as lightly. Stiles sticks his tongue out at Derek as he waits for him to catch up so that they can walk at the same pace.</p>\n<p>The sound of feet hitting the ground as they race toward him hits his ears suddenly, but he has no time to turn and look before he\u2019s tackled.</p>\n<p>Erica\u2019s perfume is the only thing that keeps him from freaking out and clawing at the weight around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he gasps, his heart pounding as she lifts him into her arms. Behind her, Stiles can see the rest of the group joining them. He shoots a dark look at Derek, but the man appears completely unapologetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing trying to hunt down fireflies without us?\u201d she counters. Stiles pulls back to look at her flatly, but she just grins and kisses the top of his snout.</p>\n<p>He sighs dramatically and allows himself to go limp in her arms, a dead weight. She rolls her eyes and hoists him into a position that\u2019s easier to carry him in.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t miss how Derek makes sure to stay close to her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They find the fireflies over a ridge about a mile through the woods, their little pack laughing loudly and shoving at each other like the group of obnoxious teenagers they are.\u00a0 Stiles walks alongside them, occasionally darting between them to join in.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice, he thinks, and he\u2019s thankful Derek invited the others now. He wants to remember his friends just like this.</p>\n<p>Scott is the first to spot the flickering lights over the horizon, a sound of awe escaping as he stops dead. Stiles runs into him, is about to yell at the boy, but cuts himself off when he sees the field as well, the glow of fireflies littering the grass below.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is disgusting,\u201d Jackson groans, ruining everything about the moment. Lydia elbows him. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s disgusting. The only thing down there is a bunch of bugs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA true romantic,\u201d she sighs. Stiles does her the favor of biting Jackson\u2019s ankle, dashing off before Jackson can retaliate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little shit!\u201d Jackson shouts after him as he races down to the field.\u00a0 He feels energetic and excited, bursting with something that\u2019s less primal and more gratified. Derek catches up to him, just in case, and Stiles isn\u2019t worried in that moment about changing, but he still wants Derek near.</p>\n<p>He plays around with the lightning bugs, pouncing, catching them in his paws, trying not to feel too much like a cat.\u00a0 The laughter he hears from his friends is infectious and he never wants to let that sound go. When he looks over his shoulder, Derek is sitting on the grass, legs outstretched and leaning back on his hands as they balance him from behind. He\u2019s watching the pack dance around in the lights, slipping and sliding where the ground is muddy, tackling each other, giving piggy back rides. He looks content, proud even, and maybe a little in awe. It\u2019s an expression Stiles hasn\u2019t seen on him before. When he stares at Derek, he gets the feeling that Derek is savoring the moment just as much as he is, like maybe Derek never imagined he\u2019d get to experience his world not engulfed in flames, or what it was like to have a family again and truly believe he could be happy.</p>\n<p>Sinking low into the grass not at all like a real fox would do (and he is more than okay with that), Stiles gets ready to attack. He knows Derek is completely aware of where he is and what he\u2019s doing even without looking, but that doesn\u2019t stop Stiles from taking a flying leap onto Derek\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Derek allows himself be taken to the ground with a grunt, letting loose a long-suffering sigh as he looks up at Stiles. Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need something?\u201d Derek drawls, a few lights flickering over his face. Stiles had every intention of saying something smarmy and ridiculous \u2013 something about how marvelous Derek looks by candlelight \u2013 but he\u2019s caught by the green glow and how it makes everything softer, like when Derek is asleep. Except, right now, Derek is wide awake and watching him.</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Stiles fights the urge to do something stupid like lick into Derek\u2019s mouth. Derek frowns, tensing when he realizes something is wrong, which would kind of be sweet if Derek wasn\u2019t actually the problem \u2013 or at least part of it.</p>\n<p>Stiles whimpers, feeling something break.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d he says quietly, not even sure if he\u2019s referring to his house or something more.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t tell him he can\u2019t go home, doesn\u2019t tell him to suck it up or ask Stiles to elaborate, or even change his expression.</p>\n<p>He just runs his hand over Stiles back and says, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB03-fireflies-small.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"599\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter calls with news a week later, when Stiles can feel nature clawing at his insides, tearing at his mind, at his chest, even when touching Derek.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a summoning spell they can use that will force the witch to make herself known and keep her trapped long enough that they can at least talk to her. They\u2019ll need Deaton to help locate some of the ingredients, it might take a bit longer, but it\u2019s the first real lead they\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>Stiles stares blankly at Derek\u2019s computer screen as Buttercup is forced to marry Prince Humperdinck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 words start being vocalized as growls by the time the majority of the ingredients are found. He\u2019s still him, can still think, emote, and control himself with his human consciousness; he thinks it doesn\u2019t really matter when no one can understand him.</p>\n<p>By the time they\u2019re waiting on the last ingredient, Deaton has given Derek drugs to administer to Stiles. They keep him tired, make him spend most of his day sleeping, and Stiles is okay with it. If he\u2019s sleeping, barely awake, he\u2019s not wishing the meat he\u2019s swallowing was covered in fresh blood. The animal in him remains dormant.</p>\n<p>Time passes weirdly after that. Stiles has no sense of day or night or how many hours or weeks or months it\u2019s been. Derek wakes him up to eat, takes him outside to go to the bathroom, and then he loses himself in the darkness again.</p>\n<p>When the summoning spell is ready, they take Stiles out into the forest where the initial confrontation took place. Derek sets him gently on a tree stump, and goes to help Scott and Lydia prepare.</p>\n<p>Stiles remains asleep through it all, misses it entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds out later that it was incredibly anti-climactic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The witch stares blankly at the small group of teenage werewolves and humans, looking as though she\u2019s trying to come up with a plausible reason for them to have brought her here. She squints when they try to refresh her memory, pushing Jackson out in front of them and explaining his misstep onto her ex-husband\u2019s grave.</p>\n<p>Her lips purse as she considers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201dshe says finally, hands dropping down to her hips, fingers tapping against her beaded dress. \u201cWhich husband, again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek reminds himself that disemboweling her will get them nowhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one that was buried here,\u201d he growls instead, gesturing emphatically to the ground they\u2019re standing on. Her eyes widen as if maybe that turned a light on in her brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! You mean Aldridge?\u201d She snorts, a stifled cackle. \u201cRight, right. Okay, yes. I remember you. Somewhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rubbing the spot where pressure is building behind his skull, Derek lets Scott take over.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well\u2026\u201d he begins. Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cWhen Jackson <em>accidentally</em> offended you back then\u2026 You kind of turned my best friend into a fox.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and points out the sleeping animal. The witch looks bemused.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI mean, maybe I did. That sounds like me when I\u2019m having a rough day, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek snarls, hands clenching into fists. The witch gives him a sidelong glance partnered with a dismissive wave of her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do you want me to do about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhm,\u201d Scott tries, looking stunned by her response. Shaking his head, he clears his throat and straightens his spine, putting on a brave face. \u201cChange him back?\u201d His act fails when his voice raises an octave at the end, and even more so when he tacks on a hurried, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>The witch shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott falters, her answer taking the fight out of him and replacing it with confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cO-\u2026What?\u201d</p>\n<p>She repeats her shrug, bringing a hand up to inspect her nails.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t really care one way or another what species your little friend is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026 like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d she echoes with a scoff. \u201cYou ripped me out of the middle of my vacation in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. If it keeps you from ever contacting me again in your adorable desperation, then I\u2019ll turn him back and make him a king.\u201d</p>\n<p>The expression on Scott\u2019s face says that he\u2019s actually considering her offer, probably thinking about how cool it would be to be best friends with a king. Allison steps in front of him and intervenes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d she says, placating. \u201cJust making him human again will be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d the witch sighs and her eyes glow, her mouth moving without a sound leaving her lips. When she finishes, Stiles is still a fox. Derek takes a menacing step forward, grunting when he suddenly feels restrained, unable to move.</p>\n<p>The witch shoots him a dark look, her palm open and facing him. \u201cCalm down. The spell will wear off in a few hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Isaac wonders, glancing around the clearing as if he\u2019s missed something. The witch rubs the bridge of her nose and mutters something about, <em>\u201cWerewolves, ugh.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Contact me again and the earth will open below your feet and swallow you and everything you love,\u201d she says disarmingly.</p>\n<p>And then she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Lydia lets out a low whistle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is this a kissing book?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u2013</em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/foxprints2.jpg\" alt width=\"650\" height=\"65\" align=\"middle\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up feeling dizzy, aching all over.\u00a0 He rolls onto his stomach, burying his face into the pillow, and pauses when he registers his head taking up more surface area than he\u2019s used to.</p>\n<p>Groaning, he pushes himself up. He keeps his eyes closed, squeezes them, and prays to every god that may or may not exist that the sensation of his fingers spreading on the mattress isn\u2019t the same painful fantasy he\u2019s been experiencing since Deaton started him on the drugs.\u00a0 As he finally pries his eyes open, he slowly brings his gaze down to what he hopes are his hands, letting out an amazed cry when he sees human skin instead of fur.</p>\n<p>Relief floods into Stiles so sharply, so overwhelmingly, and excruciatingly, that he loses his breath, feels like he might vomit, like he\u2019s dizzy and he just wants to curl up and sob because he has no idea how to properly emote anything that he\u2019s feeling.</p>\n<p>He does cry, heavy, wrecking movements making him quake, keep him from being able to breathe.\u00a0 He can go home to his dad, he can play lacrosse in college with Scott, he can watch Lydia conquer the world and Isaac finally learn how to play a fucking video game.</p>\n<p>He can touch Derek with sensitive fingers that will truly appreciate the curves of bone and muscle through skin and the stings of stubble, rather than with thickly padded paws.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he gasps, forcefully pushing himself up. He wipes his face on the arm of the shirt he\u2019s been put in, ignores the way tears and snot stick to the material.</p>\n<p>With a painful sense of desperation, Stiles spills out of bed, stumbling on legs he\u2019s not used to as he sprints out of the room. He almost trips going down the stairs, catches himself on the railing, then continues his race down. Feet skid on the wooden floorboards as he takes a sharp turn into the living room, almost falling over as he comes to a stop in front of his friends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0They look up at him warmly, expectantly, and Jackson only barely rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>Scott comes in for a hug, grinning the widest of them all, but Stiles ducks out of it, dropping to his knees to slide on the floor until he\u2019s in front of the couch where Derek is sitting. The man looks at him in bemusement, cocking an eyebrow, and Stiles pants, trying to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I need to know. This past\u2026however long it was,\u201d he wheezes. \u201cWere you like that with me because you felt bad for me or because it was more than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can <em>hear</em> the silence in the room, but he doesn\u2019t look away from Derek\u2019s eyes as they go wide, surprised, shocked. Stiles knows Derek\u2019s expressions by now, has watched them even when Derek didn\u2019t know what he was showing on his own face.\u00a0 And Stiles knows from the panicked edge to Derek\u2019s stare that he had assumed that everything would go back to normal after Stiles became human again. That Stiles would leave his intimate spaces and go back to being a buddy and they\u2019d never speak of the way Derek held him when he was scared, took care of him in ways that made Stiles\u2019 heart hurt, shared with him so many secret moments, anchored him. It angers Stiles, pisses him off, that Derek would have been okay with that. After all the time Stiles had spent just praying to any god that would hear him to not let him lose what he\u2019d found with Derek, Stiles can\u2019t understand how Derek would be able to let it go so easily.</p>\n<p>Without waiting for a response, Stiles grabs Derek\u2019s hands in his own, staring up at him seriously.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t care how crazy he looks to the others; he knows none of them can be surprised by any of this.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me to do something,\u201d he demands, clutching Derek\u2019s fingers tightly, loving how he can feel the ridges and the scars. Derek stares at him like he\u2019s not sure if Stiles came back wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cJust\u2026tell me to do something. Anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of Derek\u2019s mouth twitches and his apprehension grows.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Derek</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lydia groans. \u201cJust tell him to stop being ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glances up at her briefly, then back down at Stiles. He motions his head toward Lydia, implying that he\u2019ll go with her question.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t think he can roll his eyes any harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Great. Now <em>say it.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Huffing, Derek yanks his hands away, dropping them on his thighs. He rubs his palms against his jeans, stares at Stiles suspiciously, and then says, \u201cStiles, stop being ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is sure he looks manic with the grin that suddenly spreads upon his face. He rises up with a jolt, Derek looking more and more concerned for Stiles\u2019 sanity, and it just fills Stiles with a sense of exhilaration because he\u2019s human and he\u2019s allowed to appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he murmurs, resting his hands on the back of the couch, arching slightly so that he\u2019s hovering over Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes snap to his, realization dawning visibly. He starts turning white in a way that Stiles thinks might be dangerous, his eyes flickering to the hushed group of people surrounding him. Stiles kind of feels like a dick doing this in front of everyone, knowing that however much Derek let his walls come down for Stiles, he\u2019s nowhere near that stage with their friends. He feels a little like he\u2019s betraying the trust he built with Derek, but he\u2019s spent too long watching Derek and needing Derek and not being able to act on it, wondering if he would ever get the chance.</p>\n<p>He shifts to block Derek\u2019s view of the others, a poor attempt at giving Derek the illusion of privacy. \u00a0Derek\u2019s fingers are curled on his thighs, tense like the rest of his form, and he looks pained and angry at the same time.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t about to step away and say he was just kidding, because he means this, really means this, has had emotional breakdowns over this; he <em>is </em>close to giving Derek his space, when Derek sullenly quotes Princess Buttercup.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou mock my pain,\u201d he mutters like he really believes it.</p>\n<p>Which is stupid as hell, because if Derek thinks that Stiles is playing with him, then he clearly does not understand anchors as well as he thinks he does and needs to take a trip back to werewolf school.</p>\n<p>Stiles grins ruefully, bringing a hand down to rest it reassuringly on Derek\u2019s shoulder</p>\n<p>\u201cLife is pain, Highness,\u201d he recites. \u201cAnyone who tells you differently is selling something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look any less embarrassed, or any less pissed off, but his expression does morph from anxious to something a little closer to skeptical.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound too bad\u2026\u201d he begins warily, and Stiles feels a thrill go up his spine when Derek continues to play along. \u201cI\u2019ll try and stay awake.\u201d The last words are said as a mumble.</p>\n<p>Stiles knows that their friends are watching, probably getting off on this, the sickos. He knows they\u2019ll never let him and Derek hear the end of this, he knows Derek is pissed. But he also knows the hesitance, the quotes used, can only indicate how very much Derek feels the same. That it wasn\u2019t just empathy making Derek become something Stiles felt he could cling to.</p>\n<p>And so Stiles really doesn\u2019t give a shit about anything else.</p>\n<p>Beaming, he reaches down to yank at Derek\u2019s hands and, surprisingly, the man comes, standing up to his full height before Stiles. Stiles releases Derek and slowly, cautiously, giving Derek time to pull away, he brings his fingers up to curl around the back of Derek\u2019s head, angling it just right.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour vote of confidence is overwhelming,\u201d he grins, surging forward to finally get his kiss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The End.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u2013</em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>The Princess Bride</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB04-kiss-small.jpg\" alt width=\"700\" height=\"906\">\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\"That was, uh,\" Jackson coughs, breaking the stunned silence as Derek and Stiles try to see whose tongue can go deeper down the other's throat. \"That was really nauseating.\"</p>\n<p>Erica smiles and punches him in the kidney.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://dauntingfire.com/tw-rbb1/RBB-reading.jpg\" alt width=\"550\" height=\"247\">\n</p>"
