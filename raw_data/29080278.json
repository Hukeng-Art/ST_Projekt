  "notes": "<p>Hi, thanks for giving this fic a go &lt;3</p>\n<p>Before you continue, make sure you've read the tags. I've had a comment or two about a specific trope I've used etc, and I've done my best to tag everything so if you see something you dislike, this fic probably isn't for you.</p>\n<p>That isn't to say 'don't like don't read'. Everyone is welcome to read my fics, but at the end of the day this fic is almost entirely crack and something I've written for fun, so it will differ from canon, and there will be characters I make the butt of the joke. This is just a pre-emptive warning, and it does not mean that I dislike those characters or believe that the way I've written them is how they actually are in canon.</p>\n<p>Also if I haven't tagged something you think needs to be tagged, go ahead and let me know! I think its super important people know what they're getting into.</p>\n<p>With that said, I hope you enjoy! &lt;3</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>so it's been a while. I've just done two 48 hour exams a week apart and I'm finally done (almost) with this year of uni! This means that I'll be able to update a little more often. It also means that this chapter is largely unedited because I really wanted to post it and I finished my exam two days ago.</p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoy! &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Nezu ships Erasermic :-)</p>\n<p>so this one is a little shorter than usual, but I couldn't get it out of my head and I had to write it :-)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Izuku wasn't trying to murder All Might, I just forgot that in canon he was completely out of time (so in this fic I guess he wasn't entirely out of time) &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Is... is this a semblance of plot?</p>\n<p>shorter chapter today but I hope you like it! &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>There's been some confusion so I'm just gonna mention here that Mirio isn't actually a traitor and Aizawa isn't actually expelling him. Aizawa is just being a drama queen because he's figured out who was supplying Izuku with his intel.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Yes, the kid that got expelled was absolutely Mineta.</p>\n<p>Aizawa 100% jumped on the first excuse to expel him.</p>\n<p>I actually accidentally first posted this chapter to one of my super angsty serious fics. Oops....</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I honestly do not know. It just happened.</p>\n<p>hi! long time no see, I got pretty overwhelmed by life in general and lost track of the comments and everything, but things have calmed down so I've been able to reply to them all and finish this fic. I hope you enjoy the chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this silly fic of mine! It's been great while it's lasted but I thought it was time to bring it to rest. thank you for all the support I've had throughout it, despite the long time between updates! you've all been amazing! &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://marcellebelle.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to tumblr</a>\n</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a Tuesday.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a <em> Tuesday. </em> Things don't happen on Tuesdays. They just <em> don't. </em>Tuesday is, and always has been, the least eventful day of the week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So <em> why </em> is there a <em> thing </em>happening?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Eraserhead!\u201d The vigilante, small and green, and looking distinctly unlike his namesake, pipes up brightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa Shouta, also known as Eraserhead the pro hero, stares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> am,</em>\u201d the vigilante insists. \u201cI know pros aren\u2019t supposed to have the same codenames as each other, but <em> I\u2019m </em>not a pro. So it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> not </em> okay. Eraserhead\u2014the <em> real </em> Eraserhead\u2014is an <em> underground </em> hero. Civilians don\u2019t <em> know </em> what Aizawa actually looks like, so when this little demon helps them out, calling himself by that name, <em>Aizawa\u00a0</em>ends up getting the credit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Essentially, Eraserhead-the-vigilante is getting away, near flawlessly, with acts of vigilantism.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> almost </em> ingenious. Except for the part where the little terror thought Aizawa just <em> wouldn\u2019t notice </em> the pay rise he\u2019s been getting due to numerous accounts of heroism that he\u00a0<em>hasn't performed.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy intel says you like logical ruses,\u201d the kid, because there\u2019s no way he <em> isn\u2019t </em>a goddamn <em>brat</em>, explains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And intel? What <em> intel? Which one of his students\u2014?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cThis </em>isn\u2019t a logical ruse,\u201d Aizawa is feeling more than a little irate. \u201cYou\u2019ve stolen my identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo I haven\u2019t!\u201d the hellspawn waves his hands in a flurry. \u201cYou can\u2019t just call dibs on a <em> name, </em> Eraser! Imagine if I went around demanding that new mothers <em> not </em>call their child Izuku because it\u2019s my\u2014\u201d he cuts himself off, hurriedly clamping his mouth shut, \u201c....oops.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Well. </em>That was easier than expected. Apparently the kid likes to talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo yeah, anyway, I gotta go. My mum wanted me back by\u2014oh <em> shit.</em> I mean\u2014just forget I said\u2014<em>anyway, </em>bye Eraserhead!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the problem child vanishes suddenly and without any prior warning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa has a sudden urge to bang his head against a wall for three hours straight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On a damn <em> Tuesday. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Problem child.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa has a headache.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The headache is standing three feet away from him, balanced on the edge of the rooftop with a bottle of spray paint in one hand and a tub of glitter in the other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa raises a single eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The headache shifts guiltily. \u201cI swear this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa raises his <em> other </em>eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so <em> maybe </em> it <em> is </em> what it looks like, just a little, but he <em> deserves it!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In all honesty, though Aizawa doesn\u2019t know exactly <em> what </em> Endeavor did to deserve having his agency redecorated so\u2026 <em> vibrantly, </em> he doesn\u2019t doubt the validity of the vigilante\u2019s claim. Endeavor\u2019s always got his hands stuck into <em> something </em> shady, and Aizawa can probably list a number of possible grievances the kid could be talking about off the top of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat may be so, but you <em> signed it, </em>problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa isn\u2019t <em>certain,</em> because of the brilliant green mask the brat sports, but he thinks the kid might actually be glaring at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Eraser; and I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith your <em> vigilante </em> name.\u201d <em> Damn it, </em>Aizawa needs a drink. Or coffee. Preferably both. He\u2019ll probably end up at a bar before morning, at any rate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell <em> obviously.</em>\u201d There\u2019s an eyeroll there, Aizawa just knows it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly going to expose my real identity, was I? That would just be <em> stupid.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if he hasn\u2019t <em> already </em>exposed half of his damn identity to Aizawa. He just needs a family name, now, though something tells him he\u2019s not going to get it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And speaking of <em> identities... </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to think it was <em> me.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, nobody will actually believe that Aizawa spray painted his hero name in bright pink letters on the front of Endeavor\u2019s agency, but he\u2019ll <em> definitely </em> be interrogated over it, and that means <em> time </em> and <em> energy </em> and <em> paperwork. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the fact that clearing his name of this will mean implicating the child in front of him, which will also mean bringing Endeavor\u2019s wrath down on a <em> teenager, </em> and Aizawa wouldn\u2019t wish <em> that </em> even on the most irritating of his students, let alone on a kid who\u2019s obviously just trying to do a bit of good, even if he <em> is </em>going about it in the wrong way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d The <em> good kid </em> points at him lazily. \u201cSounds a lot like a <em> you problem</em>, Eraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s final thread of patience <em> snaps, </em>and he takes a step forward. \u201cYou little\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, is that Endeavor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa whirls around to nothing but empty air. He knows that if he looks back he\u2019ll find the same thing; there\u2019s just no use trying, at this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knows he should probably call it in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> But </em>he also knows that there\u2019s an all-night bar three blocks from here. Mic is always up for a drink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he <em>needs\u00a0</em>a fucking drink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll call Tsukauchi in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter-school team up, Eraser, whaddya say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYes.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\u201cShouta,</em>\u201d Mic whines, like the child he is. \u201cC\u2019mon, man. I wanna meet my nephew!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa slams the drawer he\u2019d been rifling through shut with a loud bang. \u201cI said no,\u201d he pauses momentarily as Hizashi\u2019s words catch up with him. \u201cAnd he is <em>not </em>my kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I think you might\u2019ve said something,\u201d Mic saunters up to him, a shit eating grin spanning the entire width of his face. \u201cBut all I\u2019m hearing is <em> denial</em>, Eraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa folds his arms, hellbent on sticking to his guns. \u201cNo means no, Mic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear you down by the end of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa. Good luck with <em> that.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot <em> believe </em>you talked me into this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hush, you,\u201d Mic waves a hand vaguely in Aizawa\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019d have come either way, dude. I don\u2019t usually get the chance to work underground, y\u2019know! My quirk\u2019s a little <em> loud, </em> I guess\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d Aizawa cuts off his babbling, hissing like a disgruntled cat from their perch on the edge of the rooftop. \u201cI only said you could patrol with me. We\u2019re not hunting for vigilantes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYou\u2019re </em> not hunting for vigilantes,\u201d Mic amends. \u201cI totally am. I\u2019m super hyped to meet one of my little listeners!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of your\u2014\u201d Aizawa turns, suspicion suddenly flooding through his system as he glares at his friend. \u201cHow do you know he listens to your show?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mic <em> freezes. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh no. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Aizawa grinds out, in equal parts dread and honest-to-god <em> fear. </em>\u201cDid you <em> do, </em>Yamada?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dread, because knowing Mic, the answer could range from mildly amusing to utterly <em>disastrous.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fear, because knowing the <em> vigilante </em> in question, disaster is almost a given.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> may </em> have let slip on air that I was patrolling tonight with a certain unnamed underground hero, and that if there <em> were </em> any copycat vigilantes running around, I\u2019d be happy to sign an autograph for them,\u201d Mic squeaks at the look Aizawa directs at him. <em>\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> bribed </em>the kid? And that still doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe called into my show,\u201d Mic shrugs, smiling a little guiltily. He <em> better </em> feel guilty over this. \u201cHe\u2019s so adorable, Eraser! And you were right, by the way. He really <em> is </em>a hero fanboy. He was super excited about the autograph, it would\u2019ve been cruel not to turn up after all that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get a name?\u201d Aizawa demands, before realisation hits him like an oncoming train, \u201cWait, he didn\u2019t use my hero name again, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mic actually makes a bit of a face at that, \u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d he replies, somehow managing to make it sound like a bad thing. \u201cCalled himself <em> Deku, </em> if you can believe it. Assured me that he <em> was </em>the vigilante, said he was thinking about getting himself a scarf.\u201d At this, he aims a sly look towards Aizawa, before his expression sobers again. \u201cA little concerning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa considers the kanji in the kid\u2019s given name, the only one he really has for the vigilante... aside from his <em> own, </em>anyway. \u201cHe told me his name was Izuku,\u201d he says, fatefully. \u201cFirst time we met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mic grimaces. \u201cKids can be so cruel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because what kind of a nickname is <em> useless? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody deserves to be called that, least of all his problem child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frustrating, maybe. Chaotic, <em> definitely, </em>but useless?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa huffs, \u201cWhatever. So you invited him for an autograph. How does he even know where we\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Eraser!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa slowly turns around, pain suddenly pulsing between his temples.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upon catching sight of both their faces, the kid brightens visibly, the rabbit ears sewn to the top of his green hoodie bobbing almost comically as he bounces on the balls of his feet. \u201cPresent Mic! You came!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI sure did, little listener!\u201d Mic holds out a hand and the kid fearlessly skips over to high-five it. \u201cI love the costume, bud, seriously! But where\u2019s that scarf you said you were going to wear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The brat shrugs apologetically, \u201cMy friend\u2019s still making it,\u201d he waves flippantly. \u201cShe\u2019s nearly finished, but trying to get it to float has been a trial. We\u2019re almost there, though!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Trying to get it to float? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is he really\u2014?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Mic says brightly, patting the kid on the head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t encourage him. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa nearly says it, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except, after Mic\u2019s revelation\u2014maybe the kid <em> needs </em>a bit of encouragement?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No. <em> No. </em> He is not encouraging a teenager to commit identity theft, no matter <em> what </em> his tragic past might be. That is absolutely <em> not </em>happening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, um,\u201d the kid shifts on his feet, suddenly nervous. \u201cYou said you\u2019d sign my notebook for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI sure did!\u201d Mic reaches into his jacket pocket. \u201cHow do you feel about gel pens, little listener? I\u2019ve got strawberry, kiwi, and bubblegum scented with me tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa thinks there might actually be <em> stars </em>in the kid\u2019s eyes, \u201cWould kiwi be okay? It\u2019s just, green is my favourite colour!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s<em> gushing. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The worst part about all this is that Mic is <em> gushing too. </em>\u201cThat\u2019s so awesome bud! I love green! It matches my eyes, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy gasps. \u201cMine too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A notebook is produced and a signature scribbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa mistakenly thinks that this is <em> the end. </em> That he can <em> go home, </em>and sleep, and try his hardest to forget everything that happened tonight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Eraser, could you maybe sign it too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t already?\u201d Mic squawks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would\u2019ve asked before, but he keeps trying to arrest me,\u201d the brat explains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem awfully sure that won\u2019t be happening tonight,\u201d Aizawa mutters drily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it won\u2019t,\u201d Mic assures, and Aizawa <em> would </em>contradict him, but there\u2019s a razor-sharp look of reckoning in his eyes that he\u2019s hesitant to cross. \u201cEraser, strawberry or bubblegum?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It must be karmic retribution when the kid pipes up with \u201cBubblegum!\u201d at the same time Aizawa responds with a begrudging \"Strawberry,\u201d that would put even his least enthusiastic students to shame.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! Looks like it\u2019s\u00a0<em>bubblegum, </em> Shouta!\u201d Mic tosses him the pen. \u201cYou can get closer, kid. Eraserhead won\u2019t try to <em> arrest you, </em> I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid still looks unsure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa sighs, holding out a hand. \u201cWhat he said, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem child scuttles forward, looking more skittish with every step, holding out the notebook. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, this page if that\u2019s alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And okay, Aizawa didn\u2019t actually want to make the kid <em> scared </em> of him. It\u2019s just that vigilantism is at best an illegal hobby, at worst a\u00a0<em>dangerous, </em>illegal hobby, and he doesn\u2019t want the boy\u2019s life to be ruined over a misplaced sense of youthful justice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And <em> maybe, </em> he\u2019s beginning to regret his earlier approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The notebook has been opened to a double page spread displaying a drawing that, if he isn\u2019t mistaken, is of <em> him\u2014</em>and it\u2019s <em> good, </em>and annotated apparently, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>That\u2019s </em>not information that should be publicly known.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa taps the page. \u201cJust <em> how </em>do you know the limits of my quirk, Problem Child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just analysis,\u201d Problem Child tells him, as though this is all perfectly normal, \u201cI watch villain fights, and yours are always really cool. You fight practically quirkless!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Practically quirkless. </em>What odd phrasing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa shakes himself. It\u2019s unnerving, but he doubts this information will fall into the wrong hands. The kid doesn\u2019t seem like the type. <em> Still though\u2026 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go around spreading this kind of info,\u201d he demands, signing the diagram hastily. \u201cEspecially any analysis you do on pros, kid. A lot of people could get hurt if the wrong villain gets hold of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no!\u201d the brat waves his hands frantically. \u201cI would never, Eraser, I promise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Aizawa huffs, pressing the notebook back into the child\u2019s hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t it past your bedtime or something, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s honestly an understatement, given that the sun is due to rise in a few hours. He deliberately ignores the smirk spreading rapidly over Yamada\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh yeah, I probably should be getting home. Mum will be waking up soon. Thanks Eraser! Thank you, Present Mic! It was so cool to meet you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was awesome to meet you too!\u201d If anyone <em> could </em> match the brat\u2019s ridiculous levels of energy, Aizawa supposes that it <em> would </em> be Mic. \u201cCan I get a <em> yeah </em>for the road?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d The kid throws a fist in the air before <em> vanishing.\u00a0\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably his quirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t <em> believe </em> you tried to arrest that angel,\u201d Mic\u2019s onto him in a <em> flash. </em> \u201cOh my <em> god, </em>Shouta, he\u2019s so precious!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stabs a finger at him, \u201cThat,\u201d he says, severely. \u201cIs because <em>you </em>were here. He\u2019s never that well behaved when it\u2019s just <em>me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell we know why <em> that </em>is,\u201d Mic cackles loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re so totally his dad, Shou!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa scoffs. \u201cNo way. He\u2019s such a problem child. Imagine dealing with that on a full-time basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like him,\u201d Mic goads. \u201cI\u2019ve known you <em> too long, </em>Eraser. You can\u2019t hide from me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Aizawa protests, uselessly. If only he believed his own words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m hearing from you?\u201d Mic gets in his face, and Aizawa quickly regrets every life decision he\u2019s ever made.<em>\u00a0</em>\u201cDenial, Shouta. This is <em> denial. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, when you said you were going to make your own capture scarf, I was under the impression that you\u2019d know how to use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to have one like yours, Eraser! There was no point if it didn\u2019t function at least similarly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa scowls. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how mine works\u2014and that doesn\u2019t matter anyway. You should know how it functions. <em>You </em>were the one who <em>made it.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI actually wasn\u2019t,\u201d the problem child admits, gracelessly trying to free himself again. \u201cMy friend made it for me. It honestly would have been <em> fine, </em> it\u2019s just that she gets a little trigger happy when she decides something needs\u2026 <em> improving. </em>She likes her inventions to have her signature style you know? To build her brand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa eyes the blades currently pinning his problem child halfway up the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the knives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d the kid huffs, getting a little red in the face as he struggles to keep himself upright. \u201cAmong\u2026 other things. But everything else still works! It\u2019s just that the knives are supposed to be retractable. I guess that mechanism broke though\u2026 but she still makes great support gear! You should give it a try sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Aizawa lies, making a mental note to keep his capture weapon as far away from this kid\u2019s <em> friend </em>as humanly possible. \u201cYou need some help, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d the kid says meekly. \u201cI\u2026 might be a little stuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa arches an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t use your quirk to get down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, one that lasts a little too long, before the kid asks oddly, \u201cYou think I can use my quirk for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve used it to get out of all sorts of other ridiculous situations. That vanishing act you pull, it\u2019s some kind of teleportation quirk isn\u2019t it? It can\u2019t be invisibility, because your clothes disappear too,\u201d Aizawa feels relatively confident in this explanation, because he can\u2019t think of anything else it could be. He likes to think he\u2019s a reasonable enough person that his theory has at least some merit to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d the problem child hesitates. \u201cUm, yes\u2014yes that\u2019s my quirk, but I can\u2019t use it to get down because\u2014\u201d he glances around wildly as though someone in this deserted back-alley might jump in with a helpful explanation. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t work when\u2026 I\u2019m stuck to walls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise I can\u2019t get down!\u201d The kid cries, looking a little panicked at Aizawa\u2019s dubious expression. \u201cI really do need help, Eraser. Please don\u2019t go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, kid,\u201d Aizawa soothes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to just leave you here.\u201d Stuck to a freaking wall, of all things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> How </em>is he constantly getting himself into these situations?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa throws his scarf, hooking it onto a pole sticking out from under the guttering and hauling himself up the wall until he\u2019s level with the child. He tugs experimentally at one of the blades lodged into the wall, and then considers the tangled mess of the copycat capture scarf\u2014the kid wrapped firmly inside. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to cut it, problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid is visibly upset by this. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t another way,\u201d Aizawa interrupts, not unkindly. \u201cI can\u2019t untangle you without pulling those knives out, and they\u2019re wedged too deep into the brickwork for that. Your friend did a pretty good job of making them extra sharp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s like that,\u201d the kid sniffles miserably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa is used to having to cut his own weapon to get out of a tight fix, but he supposes that without a steady income from his vigilante work, it\u2019s probably going to cost the child to get it repaired. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says sympathetically, pulling a short knife from his belt. \u201cHold onto me while I cut it, okay? It\u2019s a long way to fall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t too far really, but the kid is a little too wrapped up to get into a good landing position, and a broken ankle is probably the last thing he needs. It\u2019s the last thing <em> Aizawa </em>needs too, because Recovery Girl gets a little testy about being woken up in the middle of the night for an impromptu healing session. She\u2019ll probably be different if it\u2019s a kid he\u2019s dragging to her, but he\u2019s received far too many lectures over the years about his recklessness in the field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the kid says, and reaches for Aizawa\u2019s shoulder as the hero raises his knife, cutting cleanly through the white rope binding the child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid almost falls, but he manages to hold on long enough for Aizawa to grab him, wrapping an arm around his middle for good measure. \u201cClimb onto my back,\u201d he grunts, the strain of holding the both of them up with one arm making him shake slightly. \u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult, but they manage to get into a position in which Aizawa is gripping his capture scarf with both hands, while the kid clings steadfastly to his back like a tiny, teenaged spider-monkey. Aizawa quickly climbs down, letting the kid drop to the ground, and then helping him untangle the mess of white rope.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child eyes the end result forlornly. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so upset that you cut one of her babies in half.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Right,\u201d Aizawa decides not to give that one too much thought. \u201cAre you going to be alright from here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid glances back up at him, \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he says, still sounding a little unhappy. \u201cThanks for helping me, Eraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Aizawa says gently, reaching out to put a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have to cut my own weapon all the time. You\u2019re trying to be like me, aren\u2019t you? I think you\u2019ve pretty much nailed it here, problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The smile he receives is almost blinding. \u201cThanks Eraser!\u201d The kid chirps brightly, darting forward before Aizawa can say anything in return and wrapping his thin arms tightly around the hero\u2019s middle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa startles, before relaxing. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kid.\u201d He pats the child\u2019s head, \u201cMaybe you should test the next scarf before you take it out with you. What do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid lets go, stepping back and grinning sheepishly at him. \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d he promises. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Eraser!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you, kid,\u201d Aizawa gives his head another pat. \u201cTry not to get in too much trouble, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid shrugs, \u201cNo promises.\u201d He takes another step back, before vanishing into the shadows of the ill-lit alleyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa sighs, glancing up at the remainder of the kid\u2019s capture weapon, fluttering ever so slightly in the soft night breeze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His kid is such a problem child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nine in the morning and Nezu is looking positively gleeful. That\u2019s the only way Aizawa can think to describe him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Aizawa!\u201d The principal waves him over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so chipper?\u201d Aizawa feigns boredom, his pulse thrumming rapidly as he blinks languidly, eyes half-lidded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou noticed!\u201d Nezu exclaims in delighted surprise. \u201cTell me, do you know of anyone who goes by the name of Midori?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t. \u201cNo,\u201d he hedges, because this could go in a number of directions, and about half of those will likely be present in his nightmares tonight. \u201cI can\u2019t say I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Nezu admits. \u201cI\u2019ve combed the quirk registry database multiple times and I cannot find a single individual who fits the profile I\u2019ve been building.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking,\u201d Aizawa is going to regret this line of questioning, he just knows it. \u201cExactly<em> why </em> have you been building a profile on them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Nezu smiles. (Aizawa shudders, chilled, as though someone just walked over his grave.) \u201cI\u2019ve finally found a worthy chess opponent online! We\u2019re currently tied for wins\u2014though I have to admit, their play style is <em> ingenious. </em>Thoroughly unlike anyone I\u2019ve challenged before. I\u2019ve been wanting to ask them to tea for quite a while now, but they\u2019re proving exceptionally difficult to track down. Actually\u2014\u201d he pauses, before giving Aizawa a considering look. \u201cDo you have hero work beyond your usual patrols at the moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa does not like where this is going. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says, unnecessarily. Nezu likely asked already knowing this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect! Just what I need\u2014some eyes on the street. I\u2019m employing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already employed by you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, but this is a private matter,\u201d Nezu replies, sagely. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right of me to use UA resources in such a way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to interrogate a network of low-level crime syndicates about this chess prodigy?\u201d Aizawa clarifies\u2014because when Nezu says \u2018eyes on the street,\u2019 that is what he <em>really </em>means. \u201cYou do<em> realise</em> how shady this sounds, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlas, I have already exhausted every legal avenue\u2014there is nobody with that name who fits the parameters, so I have decided to broaden my reach to society\u2019s underbelly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it couldn\u2019t be a <em> pseudonym?\u201d </em> Aizawa demands, mostly as a last ditch attempt to <em> get out of this. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already taken that into account,\u201d Nezu sighs, perturbed. \u201cA dead end, unfortunately. I suspect my parameters are missing something <em> vital. </em>That is where you come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Aizawa is grasping at straws now. \u201cDoesn\u2019t asking a UA teacher to do this violate UA's code of professional ethics?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn seven places,\u201d Nezu agrees cheerily. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you double your hourly salary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa isn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t need the money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about a favour then?\u201d Nezu tilts his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking into the identity of that new vigilante, haven\u2019t you? The one using your hero name as an alias?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa has long given up on trying to figure out exactly <em> how </em> Nezu knows these things. He hasn\u2019t even told the <em> police </em>that he\u2019s investigating the kid, for all that they\u2019ve been soliciting his assistance with the capture. He has no doubt Nezu has been sitting on this information since the very beginning, waiting for exactly the right moment to leverage it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Just because Nezu has him cornered fair and square doesn\u2019t mean Aizawa is going to make it <em> easy </em>for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d Nezu\u2019s smile is disarming. \u201cI had the thought that we could perhaps help each other, Eraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa narrows his eyes suspiciously. \u201cYou want me to track down your\u2026 playmate\u2014who is, in all likelihood, a villain, in exchange for\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUncovering the vigilante\u2019s identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do <em> that, </em>but you can\u2019t figure out who this Midori is yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu waves a paw dismissively. \u201cVigilantes almost always leave substantive evidence, if you know where to look. I\u2019ll notify Tsukauchi\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa says immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause in which Nezu simply stares at Aizawa, before a strange light begins to dawn in his beady eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the police involved?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re <em> already </em> involved, and Nezu likely knows that. It\u2019s less that Aizawa doesn\u2019t want them involved, and more that he doesn\u2019t want them to be <em> Nezu\u2019s </em> brand of involved, because that will end up with the kid arrested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa should also probably <em> tell </em>the principal that the vigilante is a kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa?\u201d Nezu prompts, looking more delighted by the second, as if this conversation has just taken a turn in a <em> very </em>entertaining direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a child,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cThe vigilante\u2014he can\u2019t be older than thirteen or fourteen <em> at most. </em> I want legal immunity for him and a place in the hero course when he\u2019s old enough, provided he discontinues all vigilante activities. If you can promise me that, I\u2019ll look for this Midori.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu is quiet for a moment. \u201cI can only promise that if you catch him before the police do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Aizawa says, determination flooding through him. \u201cI\u2019ll get through to the kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can only hope,\u201d Nezu replies solemnly, though his eyes are sparkling. \u201cOh, what a <em> turn </em> this has taken!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only once he\u2019s back safely in his office that he allows himself to <em> shudder. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midori must be a truly terrifying individual, to catch the attention of <em> Principal Nezu </em> in this way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thought of dealing with <em> two </em>of them\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t enough caffeine in the <em> world. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa catches sight of the kid on his evening patrol.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEraserhead!\u201d The child bounds over to him, entirely void of self-preservation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t consider you a threat.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that Aizawa <em> is </em> a threat\u2014but he\u2019s surprised at the immediate trust the kid puts in him, considering that he <em> had </em> been a threat not so long ago, at least in the kid\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little concerning,\u00a0<em>na\u00efve, </em>even, but what else could he reasonably expect from someone so young?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid throws his thin arms around Aizawa\u2019s middle\u2014because apparently that\u2019s a <em> thing </em>now\u2014beaming brightly up at him. The mask obscuring the upper half of his face doesn\u2019t hide his brilliantly green eyes, which practically shine with hero-worship.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn it, Aizawa doesn\u2019t <em> deserve </em>this kid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem child,\u201d he pats the kid lightly on the head. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out a deal for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> This </em>is apparently cause for suspicion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d The child narrows his eyes, taking a step back as he does so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHang up your vigilante costume, and I\u2019ll get you immunity and a place in the UA hero course for your entry year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s better just to rip the bandage off. Aizawa considers this to be one of those times\u2014there\u2019s no use stumbling incoherently around the topic. Any convincing can come after, if he even needs to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid <em> scoffs. </em>\u201cI can\u2019t be a hero, Eraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> That </em> takes Aizawa by surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re already a hero, kid. You just need a license to make it official.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid flinches, his eyes wide. \u201cI\u2014you really think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa is officially <em> concerned.\u00a0</em> \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m\u2014\u201d the kid breaks off, flinching again, before dropping his gaze to the gravelled rooftop. \u201cI <em> can\u2019t </em>be a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Aizawa drops into a crouch, reaching out to grasp the kid\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy do you think that, kid? Did someone say that to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because why else would a young boy who clearly, <em> clearly </em>wants to be a hero, turn to vigilantism? Aizawa can think of few other reasons, none of which are good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid starts to <em> cry. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Aizawa says softly, using the only name he has for the child. \u201cI can\u2019t help you unless you <em> tell me, </em> kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d the kid whispers. \u201cEveryone says that to me, because my\u2014my <em> quirk, </em> uh\u2014it d-doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s everyone except\u2014<em>except</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Except me, </em> Aizawa thinks grimly. Quirk discrimination is a very real thing, unfortunately. The nickname <em> Deku </em>comes to mind, and with it a flash of rage. \u201cThey\u2019re wrong to say that,\u201d he says, his hand tightening on the child\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou catch criminals on the daily, kid. That\u2019s proof enough, I think, no matter your quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what if\u2014\u201d the kid swallows audibly, his voice trembling. \u201cWhat if I d-didn\u2019t <em> have </em>a quirk, Eraserhead-san?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares, \u201cBut you do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid vanishes on the regular, in plain sight. That\u2019s a quirk, right? That has to be\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d the kid laughs bitterly. \u201cI really, <em>really </em>don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2014Aizawa is blindsided, because this doesn\u2019t make <em> any </em> sense. The kid <em> has </em> a quirk. He\u2019s <em> seen it</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or has he? Was that not a quirk? He\u2019s pretty sure the kid\u2019s friend is some kind of support genius. There are other things too\u2014the nickname <em> Deku, </em> the pervasive nervousness, the idolisation of the <em> one hero </em> who fights <em> practically quirkless, </em>in the kid\u2019s own words\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> God, </em>how hasn\u2019t he seen this before?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid is staring at him, something almost resigned in his eyes, as though he\u2019s waiting\u2014for rejection, Aizawa is willing to bet, because kids are cruel, <em> people are cruel</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tugs the kid towards him, wrapping his arms around the tiny frame. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, problem child,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a quirk to become a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid<em> stiffens,</em> before burying his face into Aizawa's jumpsuit and <em> clinging, </em> his cries turning to heart-wrenching wails as he sobs. \u201cThank you, Eraserhead\u2014<em>thank you so much.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem child is late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t late by <em> much. </em>Not for a teenager, anyway. Twelve and a half minutes hardly warrants the rapid thrumming of Aizawa\u2019s pulse, nor the roiling of his gut\u2014but still, something seems off. It just isn\u2019t like the kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s even less like him to be late for an appointment at a <em> hero </em>school.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku Midoriya. Aizawa\u2019s problem child, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Nezu\u2019s <em>chess</em> <em>prodigy.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa hadn't been sure whether to laugh or cry when the child revealed his full name, because of <em>course. </em>Of course the kid is Midori.\u00a0The absolute\u00a0<em>chaos</em>\u00a0the boy emits had practically guaranteed it, and\u00a0<em>why\u00a0</em>hadn\u2019t he considered such a thing earlier?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then again, a small part of him is just relieved his boss isn\u2019t having nefarious meetings with any beasts of the underworld.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That he knows about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s saved from riding this rather cynical, dark and frankly alarming train of thought by the kid careening wildly around the corner and sending the both of them flying into UA\u2019s hefty defences.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d The child wails, eyes wide in horror and rapidly filling with tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Eraser, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa shakes his head, and the kid cuts himself off abruptly. The man pushes himself to his feet, wincing a little. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been hit with worse things than a five foot tall teenager covered in sludge, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wait.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Has the sludge always been there?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God <em> damn </em>it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Why </em>is it always this kid?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d he begins, slowly, measured. \u201cYou have half a minute to tell me <em> exactly </em> why you\u2019re late, and there <em> better </em>be an addendum explaining the sludge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t tack on the <em> or else. </em>That\u2019s implied\u2014and from the boy\u2019s expression, he gets it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d the kid starts, and then stops, his eyes wide, his skin ever so slightly pale. \u201cI\u2019m, um, I\u2019m not sure I can tell you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. Oh <em> no. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you being threatened?\u201d Aizawa demands sharply, cold fear flooding through him at the possibility. \u201cBlackmailed? Kid, we have ways of dealing with that sort of thing, I promise you, you <em> can </em>tell me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d the kid shakes his head rapidly. \u201cNo, Eraserhead-san, it\u2019s nothing like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid trembles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Fine,\u201d they don\u2019t have time for this. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t over, kid. We\u2019re going to have <em>words</em><em>\u00a0</em>later, understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid nods furiously. \u201cY-yes, Eraserhead-san.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa sighs. \u201cNone of that, kiddo,\u201d he rests a hand on top of the child\u2019s unruly mass of curls. \u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble, alright? It\u2019s going to be okay. The principal just wants to have a chat with you about your enrolment here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy brightens, throwing his arms around Aizawa\u2019s waist and beaming up at him. \u201cThanks Eraser!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa pats his head, before gently detaching the baby spider-monkey-limpet. \u201cC\u2019mon kid,\u201d he pointedly doesn\u2019t mention the patches of sludge now smeared across his hero costume, taking the child by the hand and leading him through the metal gate. He studiously ignores the growing feeling of unease in his gut as he manoeuvres through UA\u2019s sizable maze of corridors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Principal Nezu greets them both with a wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Principal\u2019s office usually contains a large, ebony desk, a custom-made plush armchair outfitted with a number of sizing options and another, slightly less comfortable chair for any guests or wayward students.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Usually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, besides the normal desk and chairs, there are two comfy looking sofas, plumped to perfection, and placed strategically either side of a brand new ebony coffee table. On top of the table, there is a steaming pot of freshly brewed tea and three UA mugs, with specially made coasters, decorated with the principal\u2019s own pawprint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Principal Nezu, Aizawa realises with a special brand of dawning horror, is trying to <em> impress </em>the kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d Nezu waves a paw towards the sofa closest to the overly-wide doorway, \u201cWelcome, Midoriya, to UA High School!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid is staring, bug-eyed at the sentient little critter, in apparent shock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa nudges him. \u201cKid,\u201d he hisses sharply, because you <em> don\u2019t </em> mess around with UA\u2019s principal\u2014and you <em> definitely </em>don\u2019t stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry Aizawa-kun,\u201d Nezu\u2019s smile is still friendly, <em> thank god, </em>as he grins at his two guests. \u201cMidoriya-kun has every right to be overwhelmed right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This seems to shake the kid out of his daze. \u201cS-sorry, Sir,\u201d he stammers frantically. \u201cI d-didn\u2019t m-mean to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, nonsense,\u201d Nezu gestures again towards the tea and sofa set. \u201cPlease, have a seat. We have a lot to discuss, do we not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks, \u201cI\u2014um\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa takes the opportunity to nudge the kid along, settling down beside him on one of the nice, new sofas the principal picked out. Call him what you want (and Aizawa can think of a few choice words) but Nezu has taste.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t miss how the child immediately shuffles closer. The kid is nervous, if the way he won\u2019t stop fidgeting is anything to go by. Nezu\u2019s sharp, gleaming gaze is probably not helping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa squares his shoulders. The kid clearly hasn\u2019t told his mother that he\u2019s doing this\u2014though he definitely, <em> definitely </em> should have, and that\u2019s something they\u2019re going to talk about later\u2014but the fact of the matter is, <em> Aizawa </em>is the kid\u2019s advocate here, and his only defence against the machinations of a slightly evil genius.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s up against <em> Principal Nezu. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu takes the seat across from them both. \u201cTea?\u201d he asks, though there isn\u2019t <em> really </em>a choice here, and it\u2019s just as well that the kid gives his shaky consent. \u201cNow,\u201d the principal begins as he watches the child take a hesitant sip. \u201cI imagine Eraserhead has told you a little bit about why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cUm,\u201d he stammers. \u201cI\u2014um, he said s-something about being enrolled here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t mention anything else?\u201d Nezu\u2019s narrow gaze cuts to Aizawa, beady eyes sharp as he stares unblinking at the underground hero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be a nice surprise,\u201d Aizawa says tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid glances furiously between them, anxiety clear in his wide, green eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa pulls him against his side. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad, problem child,\u201d he soothes gently, while desperately trying to ignore the principal\u2019s knowing gaze. \u201cNezu has a few questions he\u2019d like to ask you. But if you feel uncomfortable, just say so, alright? Everyone in this room just wants what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Nezu agrees cheerfully. \u201cAll in your own time, Midoriya-kun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares at the principal. Nezu is being suspiciously accommodating towards this child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yes Sir,\u201d Izuku\u2019s smile is shaky but a little brighter than before. \u201cYou can ask. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Nezu grins. \u201cSo, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Midoriya-kun, but Eraser here tells me you don\u2019t have a quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And there it is. The child flinches into Aizawa\u2019s side, his face falling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers tremulously. \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry, Sir, I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d he breaks off with a small sob, eyes brimming with tears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> This kid is so close to breaking, </em>Aizawa thinks painfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu\u2019s smile slides off his face, and for the first time ever, Aizawa thinks he sees a glimmer of worry in those black eyes. \u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t, Midoriya-kun,\u201d he says gently. \u201cWe don\u2019t tolerate quirk discrimination in this school. You have my word that you won\u2019t be treated unfairly over your quirk status.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This, of course, makes the kid cry harder, tears spilling down his flushed cheeks and pooling under his chin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa presses a tissue to the child\u2019s face. How many have rejected him over something he has no control over? In a society that defines a person\u2019s worth by their quirk, is it any wonder that someone born without might be perceived as not having any worth at all?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thought of his problem child being called something as disgusting as <em> worthless\u2014</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-kun,\u201d Nezu says icily. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would you perhaps write me a list of all the people who have discriminated against you over your lack of quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa meets the principal\u2019s eyes and gives him a short nod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seems they\u2019re on the same page, for once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>A few hours later\u2026</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-kun, do you by any chance go by the name of Midori?\u201d Nezu asks eagerly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem child gasps, his eyes bright. \u201cWait.

Clearly, he\u2019d expected Aizawa to drop the matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clearly, he doesn\u2019t know Aizawa all that well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Aizawa prompts, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid deflates, muttering something under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Aizawa folds his arms and glares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d The child yelps. <em>\u201cOkay, </em>jeez.

He narrows his glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got attacked,\u201d the problem child explains guiltily. \u201cUh, the sludge villain? The one on the news, it sorta\u2026 used me as a skin suit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d Aizawa says tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid laughs nervously. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay, because All Might saved me! Except, he kinda left super quickly and I had a question I wanted to ask him, and so I grabbed on and kindatookaridewhenhejumped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child isn\u2019t really smiling anymore. \u201cHe said that I couldn\u2019t be a hero without a quirk. I still believe you though! Don\u2019t worry. It just took a while to get down from the roof, so I was late to the meeting.

But he told me I couldn\u2019t be a hero and my body moved before I could think!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The front door of the flat looks almost exactly like every other door in the apartment complex.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Almost, because there\u2019s a hatched grate bolted into the wood halfway down. It appears partly open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leans over to look through, curiosity overtaking him, only to stumble immediately backwards in alarm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the other side is an eye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A very <em> green </em>eye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a squeak from behind the door and frantic pattering, and a quiet <em> click, </em>before\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa yelps as the ceiling above him gives way, something light but weirdly sticky falling over him. The thing tightens around him abruptly, and when he tries to move his arms he finds he can\u2019t, almost toppling as he overbalances.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A <em> net. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opens slowly then, and Aizawa finds himself staring, stunned, at a stout, green-haired woman. She\u2019s a little older than him at a glance, wide-eyed and rather soft around the edges, and if Aizawa walked past her on the street he probably wouldn\u2019t clock her as a threat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If it weren\u2019t for the assault rifle currently pointed directly at him, that is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> This, </em> Aizawa realises, with no small amount of dread, <em> must be Izuku\u2019s mother.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hole in the door is probably for the rifle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d She demands, sharply. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You should know, I have a license to use this in any and all situations I deem a threat to myself or my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Eraserhead,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cA pro hero. I\u2019m a representative of UA. The principal asked me to come here specifically to talk to you about your son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She narrows her eyes. \u201cEraserhead,\u201d she repeats. \u201cDo you have identification?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my front pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She shuffles closer, making sure to keep the rifle pointed at his chest. It would be a kill shot, if she fired. Once she\u2019s in reaching distance, she flicks her hand and a knife flies through the air from somewhere within the apartment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa thinks of the problem child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, this entire interaction explains\u00a0<em>so much.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She uses the knife to slice the net around his pocket (and <em> only </em>his pocket, the rest is still clinging to him like glue, hindering any movement he might try to make) withdrawing his ID card with his hero name and photograph. She puts the card between her teeth, digging around in her own pocket until she comes up with a tiny, UV torch, which she then proceeds to use on both sides of the card.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A satisfied kind of smile comes over her, and her posture relaxes minutely. If Aizawa weren\u2019t a trained pro, he probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed, but he is and he does, and he lets himself relax too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEraserhead!\u201d Izuku\u2019s mother says brightly, as she slices through the remaining netting, helping Aizawa brush it from his jumpsuit. \u201cHow wonderful! You\u2019re Izuku\u2019s favourite hero, you know. Why don\u2019t you come in, and we can talk more about this over tea. Izuku mentioned someone might be over from UA, but he refused to tell me anything else. He\u2019s such a stubborn boy, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa <em> does </em>know, but he also probably shouldn\u2019t by her standards, and so he just hums noncommittally, blinking a little at the complete one-eighty the woman just pulled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s used to <em> Izuku\u2019s </em>brand of insanity though. This, though a little alarming, honestly pales in comparison.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is, of course, an assumption he\u2019s forced to revisit as soon as he crosses the threshold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He clears his throat. \u201cAh, Midoriya-san, this is a lovely place you have here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman waves him off, \u201cJust Inko is fine, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. \u201cIn that case, call me Shouta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko smiles at him, offering a plate she swipes from the side of the kitchen counter. \u201cWould you like a cookie, Shouta dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman bustles off to make the tea and Aizawa immediately takes the opportunity to snoop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing he\u2019d noticed as he entered was that the walls of the apartment are lined with an impressive assortment of weaponry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second thing he\u2019d noticed was that the few spaces the arsenal doesn\u2019t extend to are covered in a number of Eraserhead posters\u2014ones he <em> definitely </em>hasn\u2019t had commissioned. There\u2019s a replica of his capture weapon (possibly the problem child\u2019s new model) lying innocently on a plush looking armchair. A pair of green goggles that look suspiciously like his own, besides the colour, hang precariously on a lampshade.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a terrarium in the corner of the room. Beside the terrarium rests a tranquiliser gun, along with a placard bearing the words: <em> Golden Dart Frog. Deadly Poisonous. DO NOT TOUCH. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t touch the dart frog.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko chooses that moment to re-enter. \u201cOh!\u201d She wanders over, \u201cI imagine you\u2019re a little curious about some of this stuff.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little curious is probably an understatement. He hesitates, \u201cWhy\u2014why <em> do </em>you have an arsenal in your apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko leans back a little, looking at him appraisingly. \u201cTsukauchi <em> did </em>say you were trustworthy,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cOnce you know, you won\u2019t be able to take it back though. You\u2019ll be a target.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa tenses. \u201cAre you a target?\u201d he asks. \u201cIs Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko nods, her forehead creasing. \u201cYes,\u201d she answers softly. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> To protect Izuku. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko hums. \u201cMy ex-husband,\u201d she tells him, \u201clikes to visit sometimes. It always helps to have an arsenal or two around him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa almost doesn\u2019t want to ask. \u201cAnd the frog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it all depends on the quirks he has on the day. Golden dart frogs are incredibly poisonous. They\u2019re usually a pretty safe bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThe quirks?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, determinedly, a hard glint in her eye as she meets his own troubled gaze. \u201cTell me, Eraserhead, have you ever heard of a villain named All For One?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere, at an unknown location that may or may not be an abandoned warehouse in the district of Kamino Ward, a supervillain shivers, feeling entirely as though someone just walked over his grave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Mum, what\u2019s for dinner\u2026\u201d the problem child trails off, blinking at the underground hero currently sitting on his couch. \u201cOh. Hi Eraser!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Inko says sweetly from her perch on the opposite sofa. \u201cEraserhead-san and I were just having a chat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout UA?\u201d Izuku asks, casually snagging a cookie from the plate Inko had set out earlier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this, the boy pales. \u201c...Other things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Inko hums. \u201cWhat did I tell you about vigilantism, Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> told </em> her?!\u201d The problem child rounds on Aizawa, his eyes wide with what can only be betrayal. \u201cEraser, <em> how could you?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku!\u201d Inko scolds. \u201cThat is <em> not </em>how we speak to guests. He was right to tell me. We\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Mum, I\u2019m almost sixteen!\u201d The kid whines. \u201cIt\u2019s not <em> fair.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not almost sixteen,\u201d Inko folds her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re not even <em> fifteen </em> yet.

No vigilantism until you\u2019re <em> at least </em> sixteen, we\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a glitch in the universe. There has to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gods, Aizawa is not getting paid enough for this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku mutters something he definitely <em> shouldn\u2019t </em>be saying under his breath, if Aizawa is hearing correctly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Inko frowns severely down at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid pouts, widening his eyes. \u201cI just wanted to protect you, Mum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa can see her caving. In all fairness, he thinks <em> he </em>would be caving in her position. The kid has a mean puppy-eyed stare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Izuku,\u201d Inko sighs softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to protect me darling.

There\u2019s a <em> traitor </em>in their midst.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only me,\u201d the traitor says quickly. \u201cMy mum made cookies, and I thought I\u2019d bring some over\u2014\u201d he falters suddenly, eyes widening in horror. \u201cAh, Aizawa-sensei, what\u2014what are <em> you </em>doing here\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Aizawa </em> is currently in the middle of remembering the very first time he met the problem child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMy intel says you like logical ruses.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How could he <em> forget? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter. There\u2019s only one thing to do. One clear solution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToogata,\u201d he says, as severely as he can manage with the way the world seems determined to spin. \u201cYou\u2019re expelled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then, with as much dignity as he can muster, he staggers over to the Midoriyas\u2019 soft leather couch and passes out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes on Inko's soft leather couch with a pulsing headache.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei!\u201d There\u2019s a child fussing over him, hands waving in a panicked flurry. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t <em> mean </em>to make you pass out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, Toogata,\u201d he rasps, batting away another pair of hands hovering over his hairline. When his vision focuses, he can see the boy they belong to\u2014fluffy, green curls and emerald eyes, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYou.</em>\u201d Aizawa growls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEep!\u201d The child springs backwards with a dexterity that <em> should not </em>be surprising at this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh, Eraserhead-san,\u201d A stout woman, just as green, snags the kid by the back of his hoodie like a naughty puppy. \u201cYou look a little better, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... Midoriya-san,\u201d Aizawa manages, trying his best to school his features into something vaguely non-threatening and not at all murderous.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Inko,\u201d she waves him off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all this, I really am. I thought I\u2019d taught him better than, well... <em> this.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What she means by this, precisely, Aizawa doesn\u2019t know. Quite frankly, he\u2019s probably better off not knowing. He doesn\u2019t <em> want </em>to know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, go on and feed the frogs,\u201d Inko pushes her son gently in the direction of the vivarium. \u201cMirio sweetheart, why don\u2019t you help him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Toogata grins brightly, because apparently he sees absolutely <em> nothing </em>wrong with this whatsoever. \u201cSure thing, Mrs Midoriya!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a sweet boy,\u201d Inko sighs. She purses her lips, before turning to face Aizawa, her hands finding her hips as she narrows her verdant eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not <em> really </em>expelling the poor child, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t have. From the look on the woman\u2019s face, it\u2019s the only acceptable answer anyway. \u201cNo,\u201d he responds. \u201cThat was\u2026 a poor attempt at a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it <em> really?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he winces and wishes for the ground to swallow him up. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d she shakes her head, her posture loosening as she glances up at him, an easy smile stretching across her face. \u201cNo need to look like that, Eraserhead-kun. I don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> No. But your son does. Don\u2019t ask me how I know. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t say that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m still taking in\u2026 everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Your son is a menace and I\u2019m beginning to see why. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t say that either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You\u2019ve raised a weapon and you did it to protect him because</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world really is out to get him,\u201d Aizawa whispers, before he\u2019s even realised he\u2019s speaking out loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko\u2019s eyes clear, and she nods. \u201cNot the world,\u201d she says, and there\u2019s something sad there. \u201cSomething worse, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. I\u2019ll protect him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think you can?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa shrugs. \u201cSomeone has to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"He'll kill you,\" she warns, and suddenly they're not talking about Izuku anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa shakes his head. \"He won't,\" he swears. \"Not before that child is <em>safe.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko gives a soft huff, amused and resigned all at once. She takes his hand and shakes it once, firmly. \"Agreed.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa learns one crucial thing that day: <em>Operation take down All For One\u00a0</em>has a\u00a0<em>group chat.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAizawa-</em>kun\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No way. I called dibs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot call dibs on someone <em> else\u2019s </em>homeroom\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Nezu. Anything but this. I\u2019ll do anything, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu sighs, pouring himself another cup of tea as he fixes his beady eyes upon the frazzled man sitting across from him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve already made the decision. Besides, you have an established mentorship with the child, and the boy clearly idolises you. Do you really believe that Vlad would be able to foster the same potential in such a bright young mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa grimaces. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what <em> you </em>are for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI </em>am the Principal of this school. It would be a conflict of interests to take on a homeroom, nor would it be conducive to the learning environment if I were to lose such a significant amount of time taking roll-call. I will however, be taking on the boy for some private lessons\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Aizawa mutters sourly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut during homeroom Class-1A will be your responsibility to mould into fine young heroes! I know you can do it, Aizawa-kun. I\u2019m expecting great things from this year's cohort, I assure you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nezu\u2019s definition of <em> great things </em> is likely to be significantly different to <em> Aizawa\u2019s </em>definition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Aizawa murmurs in abject sorrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the problem child <em> must </em> be in this <em> particular </em>class? You can\u2019t shuffle him into Vlad\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand. In respect to that, I would like to express my deepest and most sincere regrets about the situation, Eraser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c....This is the <em> worst.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about an expulsion on the first day of class? Even for you, this seems\u2026 unnecessarily harsh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that. The problem child threatened a coup if I didn\u2019t expel the kid. I had no choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... You believe he would have followed through?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... You think he <em> wouldn\u2019t?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the most part, the staff room is somewhere Aizawa can let his guard down. Well, Present Mic and Midnight are two extremely persistent fixtures in his life that he can\u2019t seem to rid himself of, and who take great pleasure in pestering him at all hours of the day, but apart from that, it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s<em> generally </em> quiet, the other occupants busy with marking or relaxing after their own hellish classes, and Aizawa can <em> usually </em>nap in peace, which helps to make up for his night patrols. All in all, he considers it somewhat of a sanctuary on the busier school days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the second day of the first term, and there\u2019s already a swarm of reporters outside the main entrance. Aizawa fights his way through the crowd, before reaching out and snagging one particularly zealous cameraman by the tie. \u201cWhat the <em> hell </em>is going on?\u201d He snaps, shaking the man a little for good measure. \u201cWhat are you all doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man looks suitably terrified. <em> Good. </em> There are already children getting half-trampled by the crowd, and a few of them are looking a little panicked. Present Mic is somewhere in there, redirecting the reporters and fishing a few kids out of the swarm, but this shouldn\u2019t be happening in the <em> first </em>place, and Aizawa is going to put a stop to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might!\u201d The man squeaks frantically. \u201cWe just\u2014we just want to get a picture of All Might!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might isn\u2019t <em> here.</em>\u201d Aizawa growls. God, that guy breeds trouble even where he\u2019s nowhere in sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell...\u201d the man shifts. \u201cThere was an official notice from the HSPC that All Might would be teaching here, just this morning! So, uh, no disrespect Sir, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa scoffs and lets go of the man\u2019s shirt, pushing him back into the crowd. \u201cEveryone who doesn't have a student ID, out!\u201d he roars, letting his hair float up and his eyes glow bright red. It\u2019s a side effect of his quirk that sometimes proves more useful than erasure itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowd clears pretty quickly, after that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Uncle Nezu, you <em> promised.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa watches as the principal sets his teacup delicately in its saucer, before rounding the desk and climbing onto the couch beside the pouting problem child. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Midoriya-kun. It seems my paws are tied this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I <em> have </em>to go to his class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku scowls mutinously, looking like he\u2019s about to say something before he just\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stops.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then, a frightful smile begins to stretch across his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I\u2019m looking forward to it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa is suddenly extremely glad he\u2019s not All Might.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three hours later, Aizawa arrives at the teacher\u2019s lounge to the rest of the teachers crowding around one of the couches. As he walks closer, he begins to hear something that sounds suspiciously like\u2026 sobbing?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He demands, worry spiking through him. Everyone here is a hardened pro-hero, it would take a lot to make <em> any </em>of them cry\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the crowd parts like the red sea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might is shivering violently in his shrunken form, tears pooling under his chin. His eyes are glazed over, and he\u2019s muttering something as he rocks back and forth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until he spots Aizawa, that is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere really are demons in our waking realm,\u201d he whispers, turning white, then puce, and then an alarming shade of green.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa watches as the man keels over in a dead faint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem Child. What. Did. You. <em> Do?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid smiles brightly, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what you mean, Eraser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa is about to reply when Uraraka and the youngest Iida brother stop beside them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Midoriya! Same time next week?\u201d Uraraka asks brightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah! I can get you in contact with Mei if you want your own scarf? She\u2019s ironed out all the flaws now! Or, well, most of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that sounds great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the two of them fall into conversation, Iida turns solemnly to Aizawa and murmurs, head bowed reverently. \u201cMy lord. I am\u2026 honoured to be in your presence. I apologise for the lack of offerings on the class\u2019s behalf. If we had only known\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Iida,\u201d Izuku grabs the taller boy\u2019s arm. \u201cWell Sensei, we best be off! See you tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then all three of them dip into a low bow before the problem child begins to drag his friends away at an alarming speed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem Child! Get <em> back here!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku Midoriya. <em> Why </em>is every single student in the school boycotting All Might\u2019s lessons?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem child in question smiles benignly. \u201cHmm, I have no idea why they\u2019d do something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s eye twitches. \u201cHe\u2019s been moping around in the staffroom <em> all day.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem child arches a green eyebrow. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s <em> annoying. </em> I haven't been able to get decent sleep since this started.\" That\u2019s Aizawa\u2019s <em> napping space, </em> damn it. \u201cYou will fix this, problem child, or I will personally see to it that you are <em> expelled.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku Midoriya says. \u201cDo you all remember the three maxims?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, mon ami.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are they? Repeat them back to me.\u201d The green haired boy folds his hands behind his back as he walks up and down his line of troops.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEraserhead is our one true lord, Eraserhead will bring justice to us all, All Might\u2014\u201d the soldiers seem to falter at this one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku narrows his eyes. \u201cDo not let societal propaganda blind you to the truth! Recite the third maxim. Speak it loud and clear!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might is a false idol!\u201d The soldiers cry. \u201cHe pales in comparison to our lord, Eraserhead! We will not allow his wrongful teachings to sully our minds!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku leans back smugly. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soon, Nezu won\u2019t have a <em> choice </em> but to fire the number one hero, and without All Might pissing Aizawa off, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll expel Izuku. Hell, he\u2019ll probably <em> thank </em>him!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all falling into place.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is there a picket line outside Nezu\u2019s office?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t you ask the picketers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. Half of them fainted on <em> sight </em>upon seeing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d the problem child says thoughtfully. \u201cAnd what did the rest do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Aizawa sucks in a shuddering breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c....

Please, accept this gift as my offering to you.\u201d Then, he backs away, paws still clasped reverently, before fleeing down the corridor faster than Aizawa has ever seen him run.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Aizawa whispers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhat.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMIDORIYA!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>The whispers in the underground run rampant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Haven't you heard?

It's an odd look on him. \"I am going to do what I always wanted to do, before all this quirk malarkey got in the way.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kurogiri sounds nervous when he says slowly. \"And what would that be, Sir?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I,\" All For One says grandly. \"Will become a botanist.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kurogiri stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Well, I was hoping for a bit more enthusiasm than that!\" All For One sniffs. \"I thought you would support my dreams no matter what, Kurogiri!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I do, Sir, it's just... a botanist.<em>... really?\"</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Why do you\u00a0think I fell in love with Inko in the first place! With hair like that, she reminded me so much of the hobby I had to abandon when I took up villainy. In fact, I'd like you research any relevant college courses and apply to them all on my behalf.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'll... see what I can do, Sir.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's crazy,\" the news reporter is saying. \"I mean, villainy in Japan seems to have just stopped overnight! Some have attributed this phenomenon to a mysterious individual known as <em>the Dark Lord Eraserhead.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's not fair,\" Izuku moans. \"I mean, I save Japan from the evil clutches of villainy and\u00a0<em>this\u00a0</em>is the response I get?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No vigilantism before you're sixteen, Izuku,\" Inko says calmly, from where she's lovingly cleaning her favourite bayonet on the plush leather sofa. \"We've been through this. You're not going to get out of your grounding just because you saved the world one time, okay? You'll just have to go to the mall with your friends another day.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"So unfair,\" Izuku grumbles. \"I bet Dad would let me go. I fixed the staffroom issue for him. He's free to nap all he wants, now.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares hard at the little girl on his doorstep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Greetings, Dark Lord Eraserhead,\" she says, clutching a candied apple in her sticky hands. The caramel seems to have made its way onto her forehead and into her hair as well. The horn peaking out of the wavy stands seems to have been spared, though Aizawa doesn't know how long that will last.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"That's not my name.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It is.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's\u00a0<em>not.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Is too!\" The girl's face screws up, her red eyes filling with sudden tears</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uh oh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay!\" Aizawa holds his hands up in surrender. \"Okay, fine! That can be my name. Just... just don't\u00a0<em>cry.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl sniffles, rubbing her eyes before smiling tremulously. The candy apple falls to the floor in the process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Crisis... averted?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Great,\" Aizawa exhales forcefully. \"Now, what do you want?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The little girl sucks in a huge breath, clenching her tiny fists and squeezing her eyes shut as she yells, \"I've come to be your successor so that I can one day take over the underground in your name!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>ALL MIGHT RETIRES!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>All Might, the former number one hero, has announced his resignation, citing the reason that he's \"too old for this shit!\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>More details on page 4.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Izu-kun,\" Shouto Todoroki says slowly, carefully. \"You do know what this means, don't you?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles adoringly at the boy beside him. He doesn't know how he managed to get such a wonderful boyfriend, but he knows that he'd do just about anything for him. Like, literally anything. \"It means that we succeeded, Shoucchan.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouto shakes his head gravely. \"It <em>means\u00a0</em>that my father is now the number one hero.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku understands at once. \"We'll fix this,\" he says, staring out at the skyline of Musutafu. He can hear the sounds of war drums echoing in the distance. Or perhaps it's the steady thrumming of his own heartbeat. He is in love, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Either way....</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry, Shoucchan. I have a <em>plan.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">THE END</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
