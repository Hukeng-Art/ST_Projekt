  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs Bakugou, like, your secret sugar daddy or something?\u201d Kaminari asks.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou promptly spits out his tea.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDude, gross!\u201d Kaminari yelps, flinching away as Eijirou coughs and slams a fist into his chest to clear his windpipe.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he rasps, still trying to clear his throat. Thankfully they're on break so the classroom is mostly empty, but the students that had stayed are staring at them and he grabs a napkin to wipe up the mess. \u201cWhere did that even come from?\u201d he asks, lowering his voice. Next to him, Kaminari shrugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, and Eijirou glances across the room to where Bakugou is sitting. He has his head phones in and hasn\u2019t even looked up at the commotion. Eijirou breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cJust seems like ever since Kamino, he\u2019s always buying you stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat- that\u2019s not even-,\u201d Eijirou splutters, shifting his attention back to Kaminari. \u201cKamino doesn\u2019t even count. You know how he is, man, that was just his way of saying thank you for the rescue.\u201d But before Eijirou can finish, Kaminari is already shaking his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI didn\u2019t see him giving money to anyone else,\u201d he says, and when Eijirou opens his mouth Kaminari bulldozes right over him. \u201cBesides, didn\u2019t he pay for your lunch yesterday?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow did you-\u201d Eijirou starts and then cuts himself off, flushing. But Kaminari\u2019s already heard him and shoots him a knowing grin before craning around in his seat to wave Sero over. Eijirou panics, frantically miming at Kaminari to keep quiet but the boy pays him no attention.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSero, isn\u2019t Bakugou Kirishima\u2019s sugar daddy?\u201d he asks as soon as Sero sits down.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sero blinks. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At that, Eijirou grins, shooting Kaminari a smug look and Kaminari face palms. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says, dragging out the words as he runs his hand through his hair, \u201cyou\u2019re telling me you really haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d But Sero only looks confused and Kaminari groans. \u201cThe night vision goggles? The lunches?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGuess it\u2019s just wishful thinking on your part, dude,\u201d Eijirou starts to say, but Sero interrupts him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat\u2019s this about lunches?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNothing!\u201d Eijirou yelps, trying to physically insert himself between the two, but Kaminari just shoves a hand into his face so he can address Sero.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBakugou\u2019s been buying Kirishima lunch,\u201d he says, leaning over like he\u2019s sharing government secrets. \u201cI only saw it once but who knows how long it\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOnce,\u201d Eijirou sighs, \u201cthe answer is once.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He doesn\u2019t mention the vending machine snacks or arcade tokens Bakugou had bought him the day before. It doesn\u2019t matter either way - Kaminari and Sero still don\u2019t look convinced.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou isn\u2019t sure why it\u2019s such a big deal - it\u2019s not like food and tokens amount to much in the long run. Walking back to the dorms with Bakugou he tries to think back to the lunch incident, analyze it from a different perspective.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It hadn\u2019t seemed that weird at the time. They had been waiting in line in the cafeteria, Bakugou a step ahead of him as they picked their entrees and side dishes off the serving line, and Bakugou had bought his lunch. He hadn\u2019t said anything, just whipped out enough money to pay for the both of them while Eijirou had been waffling over the desert options. By the time Eijirou had made it to the cashier, she was already moving on to the next person and Bakugou was yelling at him to hurry up.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou paid for me?\u201d he\u2019d asked as he sat down and Bakugou had looked at him like he was an idiot. Eijirou laughed. \u201cThanks dude! Next time is my treat.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then Bakugou had glared at him, told him to shut up and eat, and that had been it. Just a friend buying another friend lunch. Nothing to write home about.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But now that Kaminari and Sero are freaking out about it, he realizes that he never did pay Bakugou back. That was pretty unmanly. He grimaces.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Bakugou barks. Eijirou jolts. While he\u2019d been lost in thought, they\u2019d made it back to the dorms and now Bakugou is standing on the steps, looking back at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, guilt pooling in his stomach. Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrow and Eijirou tries to think of some way he can pay Bakugou back without triggering one of his ego\u2019s many landmines. \u201cJust- do you want to get something to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe just had lunch two hours ago and you\u2019re already hungry?\u201d Bakugou asks and Eijirou frowns.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d he says. Truth be told, he actually is a little hungry, but there\u2019s no point in trying to treat Bakugou to food if he\u2019s already full. He looks down, brows drawing together as he mulls over his options, and above him Bakugou sighs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he grumbles as he stalks back down the stairs, grabbing Eijirou\u2019s shoulder and spinning him around as he passes.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Eijirou asks but Bakugou doesn\u2019t say anything, staying silent all the way to the Kiyashi-ward shopping district. The streets there are lined with shops and restaurants and Eijirou can\u2019t help but look around. He can see everything from bookstores to boutiques to game centers, and for once Bakugou isn\u2019t yelling at him to hurry up, content to let him browse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And even though Eijirou has no idea what had made Bakugou decide to bring him here, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to pay him back so he doesn\u2019t question it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the storefronts catches his eye and he nudges Bakugou. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you needed some more weights?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou looks at the place, then back to Eijirou. \u201cThought we were here for food, Shitty Hair,\u201d he says, but he immediately switches tacks, leading the way into the store. Inside is a plethora of sports gear and they weave their way to the fitness section in the back, Eijirou eyeing the price tags as they go. Any one of the dumbbells or medicine balls could easily make up for what he owes, and he grins, idly looking over the selection as he waits for Bakugou to make a choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As he wanders farther down the aisle, he spots a set of wrist and ankle weights and thinks of Midoriya and the way he\u2019s always training to get stronger even when they\u2019re in class. But even while he looks them over, he knows he won\u2019t be able to get them and pay Bakugou back at the same time. So he gives them one last longing look before setting them back on the rack. Maybe he can come back and get them later when he has a little more money.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he glances up, Bakugou is looking at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not his usual scowl, more thoughtful and considering than irritated. The expression softens his face and Eijirou grins. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, wandering closer, \u201cfind something you wanted?\u201d And Bakugou is still looking at him but his brows are drawing together now, like he\u2019s trying to figure something out.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhy\u2019d you put them back?\u201d Bakugou asks. When Eijirou just blinks at him, he rolls his eyes and juts his chin to indicate the weights set.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Eijirou says, eyes sliding away to the right. He can\u2019t say that he doesn\u2019t have the money for them, then turn around and buy whatever Bakugou\u2019s getting - he\u2019d immediately know something was up. So he just shrugs and says, \u201cWrong size.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou squints at him. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole goddamned rack of them and none of them are your size?\u201d Eijirou stares at him like a deer caught in the headlights - or his own lie - and Bakugou growls, stalking over to the weights. \u201cWhat\u2019s your size?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Eijirou hadn\u2019t really thought this far ahead and doesn\u2019t know how to respond because there\u2019s no way his size isn\u2019t in that rack. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, dude, I didn\u2019t really want them anyway,\u201d he tries to say, but Bakugou shoots him a glare so sharp it cuts him off.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSize,\u201d Bakugou bites out and Eijirou rattles it off.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou grunts, rifling through until he finds the correct one, but instead of giving it to Eijirou he just walks off. Eijirou stares after him, confused, and it takes him a second to follow but by the time he catches up, Bakugou is already paying at the register.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s cool, I got it,\u201d he says, scrambling to pull out his wallet, but Bakugou just shoves the bag into his chest on his way out of the store, crumpling the receipt in his hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat the fuck do you want to eat?\u201d he grumbles over his shoulder.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou stares down at the weights set in his arms and tries to make sense of whatever\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTakoyaki,\u201d he blurts.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou\u2019s in the common room scrolling through google search results for \u201csugar daddy\u201d when Sero finds him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDoes this mean what I think it means?\u201d he asks, plopping down on the couch next to him and Eijirou sighs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe went to Kiyashi-ward,\u201d Eijirou mumbles, and when Sero waves a hand at him, he continues. \u201cHe bought me weights... and takoyaki... and yakisoba.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sero, bless his heart, doesn\u2019t laugh or say \u201cI told you so.\u201d He just nods and scratches his chin, and Eijirou is suddenly so grateful that it\u2019s Sero and not Kaminari that found him. Kaminari is one of his best friends but he\u2019s not exactly sensitive or tactful and the last thing he needs is someone immediately poking fun.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like that?\u201d Sero guesses. Eijirou gives a little shrug.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d he says, running a hand over his face, \u201cI guess I just feel guilty. He keeps buying me things but won\u2019t let me treat him back. Feels like I\u2019m taking advantage of him.\u201d He gives an explosive sigh and waits while Sero thinks over a response.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, did you find anything useful?\u201d Sero finally asks, skimming through the search results, but Eijirou shakes his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMostly a bunch of porn,\u201d he admits, and when Sero laughs it helps ease the tension from his shoulders rather than making him defensive.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHand me that,\u201d Sero says, still smiling, and Eijirou gives him the computer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what to search.\u201d He switches around some of the search terms, making them more specific and adding a few search commands, and this time the search results are more helpful, ranging from personal anecdotes to scientific research. He hands the computer back and Eijirou marvels at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat kind of black magic-\u201d Eijirou says and Sero laughs again, shoving at Eijirou\u2019s face before leaning over his shoulder to read along with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most of the articles say the same things: that the benefit for the sugar daddy is in the satisfaction from seeing their baby using the items they\u2019d bought for them. There are other benefits too, usually romantic and - Eijirou blushes - sexual in nature, but that seems to be the main gist of it. Eijirou frowns, considering.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou is definitely attractive, and he\u2019d be lying if he said his eyes hadn\u2019t lingered in the locker rooms occasionally, but it had never occurred to him that Bakugou might like him back. He\u2019s not even sure if Bakugou is really aiming to be his sugar daddy or if he\u2019s just treating him out of some misplaced sense of obligation.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But when he says as much, Sero just looks at him. \u201cWhen has Bakugou ever felt obligated to do anything?\u201d he asks, and Eijirou has to agree with him. It is pretty rare.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But still. He needs more proof.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wears the weights to school the next day.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019re heavy but slim enough to fit perfectly under his uniform, only peaking out whenever he stretches his arms. They\u2019re actually a great workout - Eijirou will have to thank Midoriya for that - but the real reason he\u2019s wearing them is to see Bakugou\u2019s reaction. If it\u2019s true that the reward for a sugar daddy is satisfaction, then he\u2019ll have to put it to the test. So he lets his blazer pull back ever so slightly throughout the day, flashing glimpses of the weights for Bakugou to see.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The effect is immediate.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou watches him all day. Eijirou had intended to shoot furtive glances his way to study Bakugou\u2019s behavior but he doesn\u2019t even get the chance with the way Bakugou is constantly staring at him. Sero definitely sees it too, but when Eijirou catches his eye all he does is raise his brows and shrug.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s definitely proof of something as far as Eijirou is concerned. He can feel the blond\u2019s gaze like a physical pressure on his cheek and it\u2019s distracting. The longer it goes on, the redder he gets, and the redder he gets, the more Bakugou stares. By the end of the day his face is the same color as his hair and Aizawa-Sensei is sending him out of the classroom to see Recovery Girl.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>what are you going to do?</b> Sero texts him as he makes his way down the hall.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou wishes he had an answer.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s nothing physically wrong with him, of course, but Recovery Girl still stares at him suspiciously when he leaves her office. At this point classes are already over and he heads back to his dorm room to drop off his stuff. He needs to go find Sero, maybe figure out a game plan with him, but when the elevator doors open on the second level, Bakugou is waiting by his door.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He jumps.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAbout fucking time,\u201d Bakugou gripes, crossing his arms. He\u2019s already changed into a tank top and sweats and his muscles bulge against his broad chest. \u201cYou gonna let me in or what?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou swallows. \u201cSure, man,\u201d he says easily enough, pretending not to notice the way Bakugou\u2019s eyes zero in on his wrist as he opens the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He goes inside and Bakugou trails after him, hands in his pockets. Eijirou feels jittery but he can\u2019t pinpoint why. Bakugou\u2019s been in his room plenty of times before but for some reason the air feels too close this time, like having the two of them in here together is taking up all the space in the room. He tries to shake off the feeling.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks and Bakugou\u2019s eyes flick up to him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t come in here now?\u201d he snarks and he\u2019s right, normally Eijirou would have no problem. He needs to quit acting so weird or Bakugou\u2019s going to notice. So he just laughs and makes himself comfortable on the floor. After a moment, Bakugou relaxes and sits next to him. \u201cThe fuck did Recovery Girl say?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust to keep hydrated,\u201d Eijirou says, \u201cbut otherwise I\u2019m all good.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>Bakugou nods like he was expecting as much.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow are the weights?\u201d he asks a moment later and it\u2019s so casual that in any other circumstance Eijirou wouldn\u2019t have noticed it. But he\u2019s hyper aware of the way Bakugou is shifting next to him, thumbing at Eijirou\u2019s sleeve before grasping his wrist and weighing it in his palm.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThey\u2019re great,\u201d he rasps, and Bakugou\u2019s smile is slow and dark, his eyes like banked coals.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGood,\u201d he says. Eijirou watches his mouth form the word and feels his own tongue wet his lips. Bakugou\u2019s grip tightens on the weight and it feels like the air in the room is tightening too, pulling them closer and closer to a line Eijirou really, <em>really</em> wants to cross.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He clears his throat. \u201cI really like them,\u201d he says. Bakugou hums, his hand pushing back Eijirou\u2019s sleeve to see the way the weight looks against his skin, and Eijirou rambles on. \u201cThey\u2019re a great workout. I feel like I\u2019m working every muscle in my body. Now I know why Midoriya does this-\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugou asks. Eijirou\u2019s mouth snaps shut. \u201cDid you want these because of fucking Deku?\u201d His pleased look is quickly devolving into anger and Eijirou wants to slap himself for being so stupid. \u201cYou trying to impress him or some shit? That goddamn shitstain of a nerd?!\u201d He shoots to his feet and Eijirou scrambles after him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo! I mean, well yeah, technically I got the idea from him-\u201d he says but Bakugou is already leaving, slamming the door so hard behind him that the walls shake.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou sighs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fuck.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou doesn\u2019t talk to him the whole next day.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He had kind of expected as much but it still hurts when Bakugou straight up turns his head away and sticks in earphones at his greeting. It stuns everyone watching into a silence that\u2019s only broken when Midoriya - the angel - hurries to return the greeting instead. That, in turn, unleashes a tirade of expletives so strong that it practically singes Eijirou\u2019s eyebrows. He\u2019s almost glad when Iida starts yelling for him to get to his seat.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d Kaminari asks when he sits down. Sero smacks him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI messed up,\u201d he groans and next to him Ashido leans in.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs this about the sugar daddy thing?\u201d she whispers. Eijiriou glares at Kaminari who at least has the decency to look guilty.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnybody else you\u2019ve told about this?\u201d he hisses. Both Ashido and Kaminari shake their heads and Eijirou breathes a sigh of relief and sinks into his desk. That, at least, is one less worry to deal with.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s the only break he gets for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For some reason the universe feels the need to pair Eijirou with Midoriya for every conceivable class assignment. During field exercises they spar together. During English, Present Mic pairs them up for group work. They even end up sitting next to each other at lunch.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And it\u2019s not that Eijirou hates Midoriya - far from it, he thinks the guy is awesome if a little skittish - but every single time they\u2019re together he can feel Bakugou\u2019s gaze spearing him like a lance. And he knows it\u2019s even worse for Midoriya. The dude is trying so hard not to focus on the killer aura emanating from Bakugou that he can barely pay attention in class - and coming from someone as academically enthusiastic as him, that\u2019s saying something.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou tries to help him out as much as he can - after all it\u2019s unfair for him to suffer for something he literally has no part of and doesn\u2019t even know about. But everything he does blows up in his face. When he calls Bakugou out, Midoriya ends up getting the brunt of his rage. When he tries to alleviate some of the tension and make Midoriya laugh, Bakugou turns murderous. Midoriya\u2019s too nice to outright tell him to his face but Eijirou can see the look in his eyes begging him to just stop.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So Eijirou feels like shit the whole day, not only because Bakugou still refuses to acknowledge his existence, but also because he can\u2019t even spare Midoriya from the fallout of his weird sugar daddy relationship that he hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d had until yesterday.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He groans as he drags his feet back to the dorms, Sero, Kaminari, and Ashido beside him. Ashido pats his back.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBakugou was extra blasty today,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNothing!\u201d he whines. But when she just stares at him, he caves and puts his face in his hands. \u201cHe thinks I wanted one of his gifts to impress Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ashido whistles while Kaminari just winces. \u201cNo wonder he was giving Midoriya the stank eye all day,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo what do you do when your sugar daddy\u2019s mad at you?\u201d Ashido asks, a finger to her chin.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As one, she and Kaminari look at Eijirou. Eijirou, in turn, looks to Sero.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sero blinks. \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCome <em>on</em>, dude, you\u2019re the one with the black magic. You gotta help me!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s Google search terms, not magic.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou <em>gotta</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOkay!\u201d Sero rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cLet\u2019s come up with a game plan.\u201d Ashido, Kaminari, and Eijirou all cheer and Sero shakes his head, leading the way into the dorms.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019re heading to the elevator, about to take it to the fifth floor when Shouji stops them. \u201cEijirou,\u201d he calls, and they all stop as Eijirou breaks off from the group. \u201cThere was a package for you. I left it in front of your room.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cReally? Thanks, man!\u201d he says, smiling. Shouji nods and goes off to join Tokoyami in the common room and Eijirou rejoins his friends to head to the second floor instead.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the doors open, he immediately sees the package. It\u2019s bigger than he was expecting, and Kaminari, Ashido, and Sero all trail after him as he moves to open it. Inside is a hoodie, red and black and with a vintage design that\u2019s reminiscent of Crimson Riot\u2019s hero costume. There\u2019s no name on the address but they all immediately know who it\u2019s from.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGuess we don\u2019t have to come up with a game plan after all,\u201d Ashido says. Eijirou shoots her a confused glance. \u201cDon\u2019t you know? When your sugar daddy sends you clothes, what he\u2019s really saying is\u2019Let me take those off.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou\u2019s never felt more exposed in his life.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He feels this on a physical level - somehow Ashido\u2019s convinced him that wearing the hoodie and nothing else was a good idea, and the fabric only just covers his crotch - but also on an emotional level. He knows what to do but he\u2019s not mentally prepared yet. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever be mentally prepared.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a few minutes of silent sweating and psyching himself up, he leaves his room and knocks on Bakugou\u2019s door.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No response.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He knows Bakugou is in there - Kaminari and Sero had taken the liberty of confirming that by talking through his door until Bakugou had exploded at them to shut up. But the longer he stands in the hallway, the more paranoid he gets that the elevator is going to ding open and someone will see him standing around outside of Bakugou\u2019s door half-naked.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He takes a deep breath and tries again, tacking on a \u201cBakugou?\u201d for good measure.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Still nothing.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s debating the merits of knocking a third time when Bakugou\u2019s door swings open.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat the fuck do you-\u201d Bakugou snarls then stops, wide eyed.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou fidgets, his fingers playing with the hem of his jacket, and Bakugou\u2019s gaze follows the movement.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cUm. I got your gift,\u201d Eijirou tries when the silence stretches out. He had been anticipating yelling or door slamming or explosions but this non-reaction is more than he can handle. Bakugou still doesn\u2019t say anything, just lets his gaze roam, and Eijirou\u2019s almost as red as his jacket now but he refuses to give up. \u201cI like it. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He says the last bit quietly, mouth almost hidden in the jacket collar. He looks up through his lashes just in time to see the way Bakugou\u2019s smile uncurls, dark and promising. His teeth glint in the light. Eijirou shivers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGet in here,\u201d Bakugou rumbles, but he doesn\u2019t wait for Eijirou to move, just reaches and pulls him forward.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou stumbles inside, almost falling against Bakugou\u2019s chest. The door clicks shut behind him and he swallows.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI- um...\u201d he tries, but it\u2019s hard to think. Bakugou\u2019s hand is still fisted in the hem of his jacket, dangerously close to resting on Eijirou\u2019s bare thigh, and Bakugou uses it to maneuver them farther into the room, eyes never leaving Eijirou\u2019s face.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou like it,\u201d Bakugou says, and it\u2019s not really a question but Eijirou nods anyway.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s soft,\u201d he rasps, then clears his throat quietly. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou hums. His free hand wanders up to his sleeve, smoothing along the fabric from wrist to elbow, like he needs to check for himself. Eijirou watches him do it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd you wanted to show me?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This time it is a question and Eijirou hesitates. Now seems like as good a time as any to bring up the sugar daddy thing but he\u2019s unsure how to do it without sounding like a two bit porn star. He settles for, \u201cYou bought it for me, so I wanted to wear it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust for me?\u201d Bakugou asks. His hand spreads wider on Eijirou\u2019s hip.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou shifts, face on fire, but he nods.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He sees the exact moment Bakugou realizes he isn\u2019t wearing any underwear.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou\u2019s mouth falls open on a breath and he sits back on his bed, pulling Eijirou between his legs. His hands curve around to grip Eijirou\u2019s ass and he never realized how big Bakugou\u2019s hands were until he feels the warmth of them bleeding through the fabric.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAbout fucking time,\u201d he says and his voice is harsh. \u201cYou better know what the fuck you\u2019re getting into, Shitty Hair, or I\u2019ll tear you to shreds.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His fingers dig into Eijirou\u2019s ass and he gasps. \u201cI know. I promise, Bakugou, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before he even finishes, Bakugou\u2019s pulling him into his lap, practically manhandling him and Eijirou\u2019s already breathless.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFucking cocktease,\u201d Bakugou swears, breathing hard and fast against Eijirou\u2019s throat. He pulls him down into a kiss and Eijirou immediately whines at the hot slide of Bakugou\u2019s tongue against him, licking into his mouth like he owns it. He angles his head to get deeper, hands grabbing at Bakugou\u2019s neck so he can keep him close, grinding down against him so he can get some fucking relief. He\u2019s hard under his jacket - he knows Bakugou is too, he can feel him straining through his sweats - and the fabric feels <em>so good </em>against his balls.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShow me,\u201d Bakugou slurs against his lips. He groans when Eijirou rolls his hips, hands sliding down to grip his ass and pull him down harder. \u201cLet me see you unzip it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou nods. The last thing he wants to do is break this kiss but the way Bakugou\u2019s using him, fucking up against him, turns him on so much he thinks he might die. So he pulls back, reaching up to yank down the zipper.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSlowly, goddamn it, fucking do it slow,\u201d Bakugou growls.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So Eijirou does - puts a hand on Bakugou\u2019s knee and leans back so he\u2019s stretched out and on full display. The jacket hem pulls up a bit as he moves and Bakugou swallows.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou want a show?\u201d he asks, rolling his hips as he drags the zipper down, slow enough he can feel the zip hit each metal tooth. Bakugou\u2019s eyes follow the movement, drinking in every inch of exposed skin. \u201cWant me to call you daddy too?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s only half teasing but Bakugou isn\u2019t teasing at all when he answers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes, fuck yes,\u201d he whispers, mouth falling open on a moan. Eijirou\u2019s dick twitches.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The front of Bakugou\u2019s sweats are already wet and it slicks against him as he grinds down even faster. \u201cDaddy,\u201d he says, tasting the sound of it in his mouth. It feels almost like a question, but Bakugou fucks up harder against him, clawing at him to keep him in place, and the next one comes out breathless, more obscene.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cLouder,\u201d Bakugou growls. \u201cI wanna hear who the fuck you\u2019re grinding on.\u201d He leans forward and mouths up Eijirou\u2019s chest to his throat and <em>bites</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShit, oh my-\u201d Eijirou pants, arching his neck to give Bakugou more space. He can\u2019t even finish the sentence, mouth falling into an \u201co\u201d as Bakugou\u2019s dick thrusts against him just right. His thighs are shaking, it feels so good, and he\u2019s going to come in the next two seconds if they don\u2019t stop right now. \u201cStop, Daddy ah-! Stop please, you\u2019re gonna make me-!\u201d His balls are already drawing up, back arching, and he didn\u2019t think he was a screamer but he\u2019s going to be so loud.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou\u2019s hand shoots out lightning fast, wrapping around him and squeezing. \u201cGet on the bed,\u201d he says and the look in his eyes says he\u2019s going to tear Eijirou apart.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou gulps. The jacket fans around him as he moves to lie down, and he feels exposed again - almost completely naked while Bakugou still has all his clothes. It\u2019s embarrassing but he likes it, wants to feel more of it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then a few seconds later Bakugou slides between his spread thighs, slick fingers prodding at his hole.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGod,\u201d he groans, licking down Eijirou\u2019s thigh and dangerously close to his dick. He works in a finger and Eijirou bites his lip, clenches down until he can feel every movement spark along his rim. \u201cWanted to fuck you in that stupid jacket the moment I bought it. Wanted to feel it against me while you bounced on my dick.\u201d Eijirou moans, writhing against the sheets as Bakugou grinds inside him, rolling his finger against his walls. Bakugou mouths at him, moving down to nip the skin between his leg and hip. Eijirou jumps and Bakugou grins. \u201cGot off thinking about it. Twice.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d Eijirou whines. But Bakugou just slips in another finger and drags his tongue over his balls.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBeg for it,\u201d he says, panting hot and heavy on him, and Eijirou keens.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh god- Daddy, please!\u201d He almost screams it but he couldn\u2019t care less about who might hear them. \u201cSuck me, lick me, I don\u2019t care, please just-\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou sucks his balls into his mouth, rolling them around on his tongue, and Eijirou\u2019s toes curl. He wants to memorize the way Bakugou\u2019s head looks, nestled between his spread thighs - wants to memorize the feel of his hair brushing over his cock. His fingers are massaging inside him, pushing hard enough that Eijirou\u2019s hips are sliding on the bed, and then he finds that sweet spot and fire burns up Eijirou\u2019s spine. Bakugou licks at him, swallows him down, and Eijirou digs his feet into the mattress trying to get closer to Bakugou\u2019s mouth. But Bakugou holds him down while he plays with him, sucks him like a vacuum, and finally Eijirou can\u2019t take it anymore.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he groans, \u201cI\u2019m ready, come on.\u201d He grabs at Bakugou\u2019s shoulders and tugs at him, and Bakugou complies, licking a long stripe up Eijirou\u2019s dick as he moves up.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cImpatient,\u201d he says, smirking. But he doesn\u2019t waste any time rolling on a condom and lining himself up. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking ruin you,\u201d he pants, and his breath fans over Eijirou\u2019s ear like a promise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou whimpers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first thrust is so good he has to bite his sleeve to keep from screaming. Bakugou\u2019s <em>thick</em> and the stretch is just on the right side of painful, an ache that makes his dick twitch.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>But Bakugou\u2019s face is even better.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s staring, memorizing the way Eijirou\u2019s face looks biting down on the fabric even as he fucks in deeper, grinding hard when he bottoms out. And Eijirou loves the attention, wants to drive Bakugou crazy, so he plays it up, looking up from under his lashes as he mouths at the sleeve until it\u2019s slick with spit.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHarder, Daddy\u201d he breathes.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJesus fucking Christ,\u201d Bakugou swears and his hands latch on Eijirou\u2019s hips like a vice, holding him down while he fucks him into the mattress.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou screams.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou\u2019s hips are slamming against his ass and they\u2019re so close that he can feel his nipples dragging along Bakugou\u2019s chest, his cock squished between them. \u201cYou want harder?\u201d Bakugou hisses, voice stuttering he\u2019s moving so fast. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to feel your fucking legs after I\u2019m done with you.\u201d Eijirou muffles his moan in his sleeve and Bakugou leans forward to bite at it too, licking and mouthing at it until feels like they\u2019re kissing.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou\u2019s chest heaves and there are spots dancing in front of his eyes but he still snakes his free hand down to grip Bakugou\u2019s ass, pulling him closer and feeling the way the muscles clench with every thrust. His skin is slick with sweat and Eijirou has to dig his nails in to keep his grip. Bakugou snarls, fucks him even harder, and Eijirou knows he\u2019s less than five seconds from coming.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShit,\u201d he says and it\u2019s hardly more than a whisper because he can\u2019t get any air in his lungs. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna fucking pass out.\u201d He can feel Bakugou\u2019s sweat dripping on him, can feel his balls slapping against his ass, and he doesn\u2019t even care that he\u2019s about to come untouched. And Bakugou lets go of his hip so he can pull Eijirou\u2019s hand away from his mouth and down between them.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCum on it,\u201d he pants, pushing the sleeve against his tip as he breathes against his lips, \u201c<em>cum on it</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou eyes roll up into his head and he cums, clenching down hard as he streaks the sleeve with white. There\u2019s so much it\u2019s soaking through the fabric and Bakugou watches every second, even as his own orgasm punches him in the gut, thrusts stuttering as his mouth falls open on a curse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Eijirou\u2019s right. He does pass out.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">x</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he wakes up, the jacket is zipped up again and he\u2019s lying on Bakugou\u2019s chest, legs straddling his waist. One of Bakugou\u2019s hands is resting on the back of his thigh, stroking up and down in time with their breathing. Eijirou shivers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d he rasps. His sleeve is tacky with cum and he blushes but doesn\u2019t bother getting up - he\u2019s too comfortable and if Bakugou wanted him to move he would have said so by now.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFew minutes,\u201d Bakugou grunts, scrolling through his phone. His fingertips stroke along Eijirou\u2019s inner thigh, brushing designs into the skin, and instead of feeling seductive it feels possessive, like Bakugou just has the right to touch wherever he pleases now. Eijirou smiles.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat was...\u201d he starts but he can\u2019t find the right words so he just trails off.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bakugou gets it though, a pleased hum vibrating his chest as he smirks down at Eijirou.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eijirou blushes. \u201cSo...am I your sugar baby then?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It feels even more embarrassing saying it out loud but Bakugou doesn\u2019t bat an eye, going back to his phone.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThought that was fucking obvious,\u201d he growls. His hand traces up until it circles just under Eijirou\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Eijirou says and snuggles into his neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They lie there for a moment, just feeling each other breathe, until finally curiosity overcomes him and Eijirou props his head up.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he asks and Bakugou\u2019s smirk grows even wider. He tilts the phone so Eijirou can see.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe clothes I\u2019m going to fuck you in next,\u201d he purrs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>"
