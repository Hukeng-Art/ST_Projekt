  "text": "<p>Wei Wuxian wakes up in a body that isn\u2019t his that has four curse marks on his arm in a place he doesn\u2019t know. His thoughts are shaky and fractured. He looks at the array he\u2019s woken up in and the notes scattered around and understands that whoever did this acted too soon, that they should have waited a couple more months if they wanted the celestial alignment to be perfect, but they didn\u2019t, and now he\u2019s panicking and confused and he doesn\u2019t think, only feels. There's a thrumming in his chest that almost feels like a golden core, then doesn't, back to emptiness, and the sensation of it leaving over and over again is going to drive him mad if he's not already.</p>\n<p>He breaks out of the miserable little room with ease and runs without thinking of the direction, all his emotions too close to the surface, like they wouldn\u2019t have been if this Mo Xuanyu had just waited a little longer.</p>\n<p>This is how he finds himself sneaking into Lotus Pier, stumbling to the main hall, freezing and dirty and not totally sure how he made the journey, and not coming back to his body until there are fingers around his wrist and his brother\u2019s furious eyes are glaring at him. \u201cWho are you? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re alone, almost, a teenager in Jin colors standing to the side with his sword drawn, but Wei Wuxian can\u2019t focus on that now. \u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d he says, voice cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, I,\u201d he wilts, pressing his head to Jiang Cheng\u2019s shoulder, and for some reason he lets him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to come back and everything <em>hurts</em>.\u201d Not physically, although he\u2019s not doing great there either, but deeper, in his bones and his chest.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, then, \u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull your blow this time,\u201d he begs. \u201cIt hurts so much, didi, just make it stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he says again, and there\u2019s the anger, but it\u2019s not alone, mixed with grief and outrage and a tenderness that he never thought he\u2019d hear again, \u201cyou came home.\u201d</p>\n<p>He really can\u2019t be blamed for passing out then.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jin Ling has heard a lot of terrible things about Wei Wuxian, has watched his uncle torture and rage against every demonic cultivator he\u2019s come across, so he\u2019s unprepared for his uncle\u2019s reaction to the real thing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s even more unprepared for the discovery that Wei Wuxian\u2019s golden core is now in Uncle\u2019s chest, but at least he\u2019s not alone in that. It all comes out after that, when Wei Wuxian wakes up and Uncle confronts him about his lack of golden core, and the whole truth comes tumbling out of his mouth, his eyes so wide and his body trembling like he\u2019s not even sure of what he\u2019s saying, and then he passes out again, and \u2013</p>\n<p>And it makes it very hard to hate him, is the thing, especially when he wakes up again and is more settled and horribly embarrassed and smiles at Jin Ling like he\u2019s the most precious thing in the world even when calling him a brat. Uncle and Wei Wuxian have several more arguments behind closed doors after that, and slowly the tension Uncle has always carried around starts to ease, and, well.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling likes him, this other uncle he\u2019s been taught to hate, who\u2019s not what anyone thought he\u2019d be or like the stories he\u2019s been told, now that he can see how Uncle loves him so much even when he tries to hide it behind rage, now that he sees Wei Wuxian can read Uncle easily, like no one but Jin Ling has seemed to ever be able to do.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The problem, Jiang Cheng decides one week after Wei Wuxian\u2019s return, is that they\u2019re hiding two different people. Wei Wuxian, obviously, who is in another person\u2019s body and so should be able to keep his identity a secret easily enough unless he does something stupid. But they\u2019re also hiding Mo Xuanyu, who ran away from his family and who people will certainly notice and recognize.</p>\n<p>He digs out a chest of A-jie\u2019s things, stuff she hadn\u2019t taken to Jin Tower because she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to use them. He\u2019d never been able to get rid of them, and figures that this will cover all the things that get tangled in his throat whenever he tries speak them out loud.</p>\n<p>He drops the chest in front of Wei Wuxian and says, \u201cHere. This should work.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has four curse marks and a soul that isn\u2019t settling quite right into his body, which is an uncomfortable experience, and a golden core that keeps disappearing, which is a horrifying one. It's there, most of the time now, except for when it's not. Personally, he\u2019s never much cared for his body, or the things associated it, which Jiang Cheng knows and is probably why he\u2019d suggested disguising him as a woman. If he were like Jiang Cheng, or Jin Ling, or most people, that would be a problem, or grating, or stressful, or whatever. But Wei Wuxian is Wei Wuxian, and that\u2019s true whether he\u2019s wearing a dress or called a boy or a girl or answers to Lady or Master, so he\u2019s not much bothered about it either way. He\u2019d never expected his apathy about his body to be tested to the point where he\u2019s literally in another person\u2019s body and he\u2019s not pleased about it. He also doesn\u2019t love answering to a name not his own, but Jiang Cheng calls him A-Ying, which helps.</p>\n<p>He wants his body to be <em>his</em>, not someone else\u2019s. He hopes this body will feel more like it belongs to him once they figure out how to get his soul settled.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the Jiang library is any use. In spite of containing the largest library on demonic cultivation, which Jiang Cheng keeps under lock and key and only three people know about. Apparently he confiscates any books the demonic cultivators he captures have on them, but it\u2019s all utterly useless since it\u2019s all just derivative of his own work.</p>\n<p>He founded demonic cultivation in three months and no one else has had an original thought in thirteen years. \u201cAlthough,\u201d he tells Jiang Cheng, \u201cI suppose the good ones are the ones you don\u2019t catch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a cheery thought. Shut up,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, absently feeding spiritual energy into him while frowning at a scroll.</p>\n<p>They have to figure something out. Mo Xuanyu\u2019s body wasn\u2019t particularly strong, especially compared to his last one, but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be as weak as this. But things aren\u2019t <em>settling</em> properly, probably because the ritual was done about two months too early. Which means the optimal time to fix, it will be then, which is only a couple weeks away from now, and he\u2019s no closer to figuring out how. \u201cWe should try the Gusu Lan library. I actually figured out most of the theory in their library while I was supposed to be working on lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you near the Lans,\u201d Jiang Cheng says bluntly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks of Lan Zhan without meaning to. He knows that Lan Zhan hated him in the end, and the beginning, but that there was a middle bit there where he thinks they did alright.</p>\n<p>He misses him. He wants to see him. Maybe this is the only way he\u2019ll be able to see him, wearing a face that doesn\u2019t seem to be quite his own, under the disguise of a lady from the Yu mountains and not as himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to figure this out, I don\u2019t think we have a choice,\u201d he says honestly.</p>\n<p>His brother scowls but, for once, doesn\u2019t argue.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen has heard rumors that Jiang Wanyin has been courting a young lady, some new addition to the Jiang clan from the same place his mother was from, but since that goes against mostly everything he knows of Jiang Wanyin, he dismissed it. After granting Jiang Wanyin\u2019s request to come to Cloud Recesses to make use of the Lan library for a research project and to iron our several details for the upcoming cultivation conference, he decides that may have been a mistake. Jiang Wanyin doesn\u2019t show up alone.</p>\n<p>Not that Lan Xichen had expected him to show up alone, exactly, since he\u2019s a sect leader here on official business, and that always involved some sort of retinue, but it\u2019s who he shows up with, exactly.</p>\n<p>There is a young woman. She walks at his side, as if they\u2019re equals, her voice low and raspy but bright. She has dark brown wavy hair that she wears mostly down, only two strands on either side pulled back from her face, no ribbon in her hair although there\u2019s one around her throat. Her robes seem familiar to him, although he can\u2019t place why. She\u2019s too skinny, which isn\u2019t an aesthetic observation so much as a medical one and she has her hand on Jiang Wanyin\u2019s arm as they climb. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Jin Ling is walking directly behind her, his brow furrowed. Should she slip and fall, he\u2019ll be able to catch her easily.</p>\n<p>Her chatter stutters to a stop when they get closer and her dark grey eyes meet his squarely. \u201cZewu Jun,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says, giving him a slight bow that the woman echoes. It\u2019s telling that the disciples and Jin Ling don\u2019t bow until she does. \u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your library!\u201d the woman pipes up, a large grin stretching across her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t we at least get the introductions out of the way before you embarrass me?\u201d Jiang Wanyin snaps harshly.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen startles but the woman just laughs. \u201cYou just make it so easy, A-Cheng!\u201d He hasn\u2019t heard anyone call Jiang Wanyin that since his sister\u2019s death. Before he can formulate any sort of response to this, she bows to him again and says, \u201cI am Wu Yingtai. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Zewu Jun. Thank you for your hospitality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s distracted enough that his mouth is speaking mostly on its own. He recognizes her robes.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re Jiang Yanli\u2019s. Jiang Wanyin has given his beloved sister\u2019s clothes to this woman.</p>\n<p>Maybe he <em>is</em> courting her.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows that Jiang Wanyin is here with some of the Jiang disciples. That he\u2019s here on actual business and so that one of his disciples can make use of the Lan library, all proper and acceptable, but it still makes him burn. He elects to take his meals at home rather than the deal with that, which he can get away with doing for everything but dinner.</p>\n<p>His mind is on the upcoming meal which is why he doesn\u2019t notice someone running by and then running into him. They bounce off his side and he reaches out automatically, his arm curling around a concerningly slim waist to keep them from falling to ground. \u201cOh shit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d says an unfamiliar voice with a familiar cadence that leaves his whole body cold and makes his arm tighten without his permission. He looks down and equally shocked grey eyes stare up at him. \u201cLan \u2013 um, I mean, Hanguang Jun, I was just, um. Hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>He abruptly realizes that this is entirely improper. He\u2019s holding her against his chest. He lets go of her and takes several steps back. \u201cHello. I apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her nose scrunches up and there\u2019s a deep ache in his chest. \u201cThat was totally all my fault, don\u2019t apologize. You saved me from tripping and getting mud all over me! Although maybe that would be an improvement on the ink, A-Cheng is going to give me such a bitchy look about this, which, whatever, I\u2019ll be able to get it out later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at her less closely, mentally stepping back so he\u2019s not getting lost in details that may be similar but are not the same. It\u2019s a disservice to pretend otherwise. She does indeed have ink staining her hands and her sleeves, and drops of it across the bottom of her robes, somehow. Her clothes are a pale lavender and there\u2019s a silver lotus bell in her belt. \u201cYou\u2019re with the Jiang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm? Oh yeah, of course, me and Jiang Cheng are friends.\u201d There is something in the way she says that, like it\u2019s not a lie but not the whole truth, but he\u2019s entirely uninterested in Jiang Wanyin\u2019s business so he doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no running in Cloud Recesses,\u201d he says instead.</p>\n<p>She blinks at him then bursts out laughing, a bigger sound than it seems like could come from her small body. \u201cAh, Hanguang Jun, my apologies. Shall I copy the rules a hundred times to make up for this grand transgression? I was only trying not to be late to dinner. I lose track of time when I\u2019m researching.\u201d</p>\n<p>This woman is strange. She\u2019s not inappropriate, exactly but she\u2019s far too familiar with him. Not technically crossing any boundaries, but people do not talk at him like this, warm and joking. No one has spoken like this to him in thirteen years and abruptly he hates her with a ferocity he knows is unfair and misplaced, but he doesn\u2019t have anywhere else to put it. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says, cold and too brusque, moving past her and not offering to walk her to the dining hall like he would have if she were anyone else, if she had not committed the grand and unknowable offence of reminding him a little bit too much of Wei Ying when he hadn\u2019t been prepared for it.</p>\n<p>He will simply avoid her. It won\u2019t be difficult, surely.</p>\n<p>Except, perhaps it will. She arrives several minutes after him, her hair a disarray and her face pale, but instead of going to sit with the other Jiang disciples at the lower tables, she drops in the empty seat between Jiang Wanyin and Jin Ling. \u201cSorry, sorry! You don\u2019t have to yell at me, I already know the lecture. Look, I\u2019m not late, am I, Zewu Jun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin\u2019s mouth thins into a sharp line, but he says nothing, while Jin Ling bites on the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not, Lady Wu,\u201d Xichen says, formal but with a lilt to his voice that mean he\u2019s genuinely amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re letting me paw through your books, you have to call me Wu Yingtai,\u201d she scolds, and her breath is still coming too quickly. It should have evened out by now, and her face is still pale rather than flush. Lan Wangji feels guilt squirm uncomfortably in his stomach. She is not in good health and had not been truly discourteous to him. He should have escorted her here.</p>\n<p>She turns to him. It seems as if his rudeness is going to have consequences, but now that only seems fair. She\u2019s not some random Jiang disciple, is clearly of some import to be seated with them at Jiang Wanyin\u2019s side, and he\u2019s quite sure his failing is about to be pointed out in front of everyone.</p>\n<p>But instead she only smiles at him, teasing and warm, and says, \u201cSee, Hanguang Jun? You didn\u2019t have to run to make it on time. Don\u2019t you that know running is forbidden in Cloud Recesses?\u201d</p>\n<p>His lips part in surprise. She should be angry at his rudeness, but instead she\u2019s teasing him.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin pinches the bridge of his nose and grinds his teeth together. \u201cA-Ying, <em>please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bell sounds for the beginning of the meal and she whispers, \u201cNo talking during meals, A-Cheng,\u201d before picking up her chopsticks.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin is furious while Jin Ling is delighted.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji faces forward and does his best not to notice her. He feels his brother and uncle\u2019s gaze on him, and doesn\u2019t want to know what\u2019s there, so he does his best to ignore that as well.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s partially successful.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai leans over to put several pieces of her meal onto Jin Ling\u2019s plate, who glares before leaning over and scooping half his rice into her bowl in retaliation. The bowl isn\u2019t meant to hold one and half servings of rice, so it makes a bit of a mess, but Wu Yingtai only looks fond.</p>\n<p>She eats her food slowly, but not in a way that lends itself to elegance or manners. Her lips twitch into an almost grimace several times and Lan Wangji wonders if anyone thought to tell her of the food here. Even eating slowly, she puts her chopsticks down before everyone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying, you have to eat,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says, speaking low enough that his voice doesn\u2019t carry further than their table. Uncle twitches, but it\u2019s an important enough sentiment that he doesn\u2019t interrupt. Lan Wangji remembers how slight she had felt against him and, against his wishes, finds himself agreeing with Jiang Wanyin.</p>\n<p>She smiles and shakes her head, pressing a finger to her lips to remind him of the rule.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying,\u201d Jin Ling says, and Xichen and Uncle raise their eyebrows in unison, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? You ate when we were in Lotus Pier.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks around at them and her shoulders slump. Her face is vaguely apologetic when she whispers, \u201cAh, it\u2019s just hard to, well, this bo- my body doesn\u2019t like to eat food that doesn\u2019t \u2026 taste good.\u201d She glances at his brother and says, \u201cSorry Zewu Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face goes thunderous. He silently does what she\u2019d done for Jin Ling, moving food from his plate to hers. It takes Lan Wangji a moment to realize that Jiang Wanyin is seeing what food is missing ftom her plate, what she\u2019d found palatable enough to eat, and giving her his own portions. Jin Ling seems to figure it out a beat later, because he begins doing the same. Wu Yingtai begins waving her hands over her plate to dissuade them, but they simply move around her, and she gives in.</p>\n<p>She buries her face in her hands, face red, but her smile covers half her face when she lowers them.</p>\n<p>It takes Lan Wangji another moment to realize he\u2019s staring. He pointedly looks down at his own plate and doesn\u2019t look up again until the meal ends.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to leave Lan Wangji alone,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, pacing in Wei Wuxian\u2019s rooms. Wei Wuxian almost points out that, considering how late it is, this is really only going to fuel the rumors that Wu Yingtai and Jiang Cheng are courting, but since he\u2019s not even sure if his brother has heard those rumors, decides to let it lie.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs, stripping off the day\u2019s robes so he can work on getting all the stains out. \u201cI know, I know, I didn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s just automatic!\u201d He pauses. \u201cDo you really think he still hates me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is quiet for a long time, enough that Wei Wuxian is almost nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t think he hates you,\u201d he says finally. \u201cHis actions of the past thirteen years don\u2019t really match up with that of a man who hated you. But I can\u2019t read him, not really. I\u2019ve never been able to. I don\u2019t want to have to fight the whole Lan clan, A-Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hides a smile. Sometimes, Jiang Cheng pretends to slip up and calls him A-Ying when they\u2019re alone together.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to call him on it any day now, as soon as it stops making his chest feel so warm.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Jiang have been here a week the first time Sizhui meets Lady Wu outside of a formal setting.</p>\n<p>He and Jingyi are sitting under a tree, working on a night hunt proposal, when there\u2019s a crash, someone saying, \u201cOh, fuck,\u201d from nowhere, and then a young woman literally falling out of the sky onto their laps.</p>\n<p>Jingyi gets kicked in the stomach but Sizhui ends up with her back against his chest, her hair over his shoulder. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lady Wu blinks up at him, leaves in her hair, talisman paper crumpled in her fist and a brush tucked behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop meeting Lans like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you fall out of a lot trees?\u201d Jingyi wheezes, rubbing his stomach and glaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, all the time,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cIt turns out I don\u2019t have the upper body strength I used to, so it\u2019s really the only way to get down.\u201d She lifts an arm as if to demonstrate and Sizhui is alarmed to realize it\u2019s shaking. \u201cYou\u2019d think it would have been getting up that would do it, since that\u2019s objectively harder, but I suppose that\u2019s the thing about limits, huh? Sometimes it\u2019s not the hard stuff that trips you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jingyi stares. \u201cWhy were you up in the tree in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust needed a place to think, really,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to find a quiet place to think in this place!\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a couple seconds of staring to notice her twitching lips. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d he decides.</p>\n<p>She laughs and stuffs the talisman paper in her robe. \u201cI am joking. Thank you very much for being here! I\u2019m grateful to you for cushioning my fall. A-Cheng and A-Ling would have thrown a fit if I\u2019d broken something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui contemplates having to tell Sect Leader Jiang that his \u2026 whatever Lady Wu is had been injured and says, \u201cI\u2019m grateful too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lady Wu snorts and pokes his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s not that scary, I promise, he\u2019s really a big softie.\u201d</p>\n<p>By silent, mutual agreement, he and Jingyi don\u2019t respond to that because there\u2019s no response they could give that wouldn\u2019t break some sort of rule. \u201cLet us take you to the healers, just in case,\u201d Sizhui says.</p>\n<p>Since she\u2019s lying on top of him, Sizhui feels how she tenses at that suggestion. \u201cAh, thank you, but I\u2019m fine, really. We don\u2019t need to go making a fuss. What are you kids working on? Maybe I can help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you a cultivator?\u201d Jingyi asks. Sizhui should probably scold him, but he wants to know too.</p>\n<p>She hums and makes a face, finally shifting off of them to lean against the tree trunk. \u201cOf a sort. I used to be stronger. If you want to get up and fight, I won\u2019t last very long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight you,\u201d Sizhui says hastily. \u201cWe\u2019re doing night hunt proposals for Master Lan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheoretical or actual?\u201d she asks, leaning forward in interest. \u201cPunishment or reward?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheoretical and punishment,\u201d Jingyi sighs. \u201cMaster Lan thought we were too reckless on the last night hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em>were </em>too reckless on the last night hunt,\u201d Sizhui corrects. When his father had gotten the report, his eyes had pinched briefly like only happened when he was worried and then he\u2019d had Sizhui take his meal in the Jingshi rather than with the other disciples.</p>\n<p>Lady Wu smiles, tilting her head back. There are dark bruises under her eyes. \u201cYes, Lans are a notoriously reckless sort. Tell me about this night hunt. Both the real one and the theoretical one. I like the implication of being too reckless, it means there\u2019s an acceptable amount of recklessness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it is a night hunt,\u201d Jingyi says in what he probably thinks is a reasonable tone before launching into the story.</p>\n<p>Lady Wu is a good audience. She follows along and never looks bored, asking questions that show she\u2019s really listening. She\u2019s clever too, her insights strange and sideways and brilliant, nothing Sizhui would have thought of even though they make total sense. He can tell Jingyi agrees, his eyes wide as Lady Wu sketches out the ideal array for their theoretical night hunt, not just showing them but explaining the theory behind each bit of it as she draws it, not a reference book in sight.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure it matters that Lady Wu can\u2019t fight with a sword. It seems like she has half the world\u2019s cultivation knowledge at her fingertips.</p>\n<p>The sun is starting to dip below the trees by the time they run out of paper and Lady Wu seems just as disappointed as they are that they can\u2019t continue. \u201cDinner\u2019s soon,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk you to the dining hall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou miss one meal,\u201d she gripes, but obligingly gets to her feet. She seems fine now, but Sizhui can\u2019t get the memory of her shaking out of his head, so he offers her his arm anyway. She smiles, crooked and small but, he thinks, real, and says, \u201cYou Lans are so sweet,\u201d before taking his arm.</p>\n<p>He smiles when she leans into him, continuing to trade talisman ideas back and forth with Jingyi. He can\u2019t explain it, but something about Lady Wu almost feels familiar. Safe, even, like how he feels around his father. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji enters the library, sees Wu Yingtai pulling books off the shelves, and resolves to come back later. Just as he turns to leave, she jumps to try and grab a book slightly out of her reach, but manages to unbalance the whole shelf just enough that it tips forward.</p>\n<p>The image of her small, frail body crushed underneath the heavy bookshelf flashes through his mind and he\u2019s moving without thinking, but he\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p>By the time he\u2019s there, reaching out a hand to steady the bookshelf, she\u2019s drawn a quick talisman in the air and flicked it forward, freezing the shelf in place, half fallen.</p>\n<p>She blinks, looking up at him, surprised to suddenly find him by her side but not startled. \u201cHanguang Jun, are you alright?\u201d She follows his hand, sees it hovering right in front of the talisman, and she\u2019s grinning at him, brighter than the sun. \u201cAw, were you coming to help me? So kind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have an impressive knowledge of talismans,\u201d he says instead of addressing that, carefully moving the bookshelf back into its former position.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I prefer not to be completely useless,\u201d she says, and her tone is still light but something about it makes him flinch. \u201cTalismans aren\u2019t dependent on a strong golden core, just your memory and imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes whole hours pass without him thinking of Wei Ying, but usually not much more than that. He doesn\u2019t understand why thinking of Wei Ying while looking at this woman hurts the way it does, like jabbing a bruise rather than merely pressing on it. He endured thirty three lashes, he can handle this.</p>\n<p>He took his own lack of control out on her once. He will not do so again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>She steps closer to him, until they\u2019re nearly chest to chest, and its a struggle not to put distance between them once more. He should, he knows, but something about the way she\u2019s looking at him feels like a challenge.</p>\n<p>He does not rise to bait easily, but for some reason he doesn\u2019t want her to see him falter. \u201cAh, Hanguang Jun is so tall,\u201d she whines, curling her hair around her finger and pouting her lower lip, a look that is not altogether displeasing but would be utterly distasteful if she wasn\u2019t clearly two seconds away from laughing at herself. \u201cWon\u2019t you stay and help me pick books off tall shelves? I\u2019m so little, Hanguang Jun, I need a big strong man to help me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way she\u2019s biting her lower lip almost hard enough to draw blood ruins even the illusion of seriousness. \u201cI will retrieve Sect Leader Jiang for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan \u2013 Hanguang Jun!\u201d she gasps. It\u2019s the second time she\u2019s slipped up on his title. He would not mind if she called him Lan Wangji, especially when she insists that he call her Wu Yingtai, but it feels like a form of surrender to tell her that. \u201cYou would leave me here all alone? What if another bookshelf tries to kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t attack unless provoked,\u201d he says blandly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s completely unprepared for the bright peal of laughter that elicits from her and he feels his face softening without his permission. Not many people are willing to laugh at him, not like this, genuinely rather than as an attempt to manipulate him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so funny Hanguang Jun,\u201d she gasps, wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cYou really won\u2019t stay and help me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He did make her walk to the dining hall alone when they met and she\u2019s clearly capable of hurting herself if left alone in the library. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai\u2019s smile does something to the space underneath his breastbone.</p>\n<p>He wishes it didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t know if wants to laugh or cry or simply lay his head on his desk and pretend none of it is happening. The last approach seems the most appealing, but it\u2019s the one that Uncle has taken, which means it\u2019s probably off the table for him.</p>\n<p>Wangji doesn\u2019t seem to have figured it out yet, but for the first time in a long time someone has gotten under his skin. It would be delightful news, a welcome relief from thirteen years of heavy grief, if not for one thing.</p>\n<p>The woman that has caught his brother\u2019s attention is Jiang Wanyin\u2019s fianc\u00e9.</p>\n<p>No one has said that, of course, no official announcements have been made and no one has caught them doing anything inappropriate. But at this point an official announcement seems almost superfluous.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin gives her the food off his plate. They spend long hours alone together. The Jiang disciples treat her with the utmost respect despite her not holding a specific position within the clan or even being powerful enough to carry a sword. Jin Ling refers to her as his <em>aunt</em>. If that weren\u2019t enough, seeing them together more than does it. Jiang Wanyin has never met a positive emotion he couldn\u2019t express through harsh, loud criticism, sure to scare off anyone but his nephew, but she only laughs at him and pats his arm, darting out of the way when threatens to strangle her.</p>\n<p>They love each other, clearly and obviously, and Lan Xichen believes in different circumstances he would be capable of being pleased for Jiang Wanyin\u2019s happiness.</p>\n<p>But Wu Yingtai has caught more than just Jiang Wanyin\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>Wangji keeps looking at her, keeps spending time with her, and it may seem like such small things to people who do not know him, but Lan Xichen knows him.</p>\n<p>There is no way for this to end well.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin knows of the time Wangji spends with Wu Yingtai because she, to her credit, does nothing to hide it. Jiang Wanyin goes stormy and furious, as he always does around Wangji, but Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t believe Jiang Wanyin has figured out that Wangji feels anything but polite courtesy for Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>If he had, Lan Xichen imagines that all of Cloud Recesses would have heard of it.</p>\n<p>When a request for aid comes in for Mo Village, it seems a perfect thing to send his brother and the juniors on, so they can at least spend one dinner where without Wangji\u2019s attention straying to Wu Yingtai every few minutes.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian considers it a bit of good luck that Lan Zhan and the nosiest of the juniors get sent off on a night hunt just when they need to attempt an array powered by demonic cultivation in the middle of Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure this is going to work?\u201d Jin Ling asks. \u201cIt looks like a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ling!\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, then looks down at the array that Wei Wuxian is busy drawing in his own blood, and says, \u201cHe does have a point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s the expert here?\u201d he demands, leaning back to survey his handiwork. \u201cHonestly, I get no respect around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, respected elder brother,\u201d Jiang Cheng intones, \u201cwhat the fuck is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorts, but just says, \u201cIt should fix what Mo Xuanyu did,\" rather than getting into a technical explanation that neither of them could follow. Well, Jiang Cheng could, maybe, but it would either confuse or frighten Jin Ling, so he doesn't bother.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill it make you less sick?\u201d Jin Ling asks, not quite able to hide his worry under his scowl.</p>\n<p>He pokes him hard in the cheek and he doesn\u2019t even try and break his hand. He really is worried. \u201cYes. This body isn\u2019t exactly strong on its own, but it\u2019ll be better, after.\u201d He\u2019s made it stronger these past couple months, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s impossible to tell thanks to the botched demonic cultivation soul transfer.</p>\n<p>He makes his brother and nephew stand at the edge of the room, checks that the moon is the perfect position in the sky, and activates the array.</p>\n<p>Three of his four curse marks disappear, something he can tell isn\u2019t related to the array at all, but he doesn\u2019t have the time to worry about it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>In between the events of Mo Manor and the Dancing Fairy statue, Lan Wangji has almost entirely forgotten that the Jiangs are leaving today, has almost forgotten about Wu Yingtai\u2019s presence in the Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s rudely reminded of it when he rushes to the Mingshi just in time to see his son violently shoved out of the doors along with a half dozen other disciples, all of them nearly barreling into Jin Ling and Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already rushing forward, but the doors have started to close. Wu Yingtai reaches for Sizhui then narrows her eyes and pulls back. She draws a talisman in the air with quick, precise movements, shoving her hand forward and causing the doors to freeze in place. It\u2019s the same one she\u2019d used in the library.</p>\n<p>She jumps into the Mingshi and his heart jumps to his throat. If a dozen disciples and his uncle aren\u2019t enough to subdue the ghost sword, then Wu Yingtai, with her weak golden core and poor health, stand no chance at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying!\u201d Jin Ling screams, reaching for his sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your uncle,\u201d she commands, no trace of softness or teasing in her voice.</p>\n<p>She dispels the freezing talisman. \u201cDo not,\u201d he starts, but then it\u2019s too late, the door slamming shut just as he sees the ghost sword heading for her back. There\u2019s a bitten off scream that must be Wu Yingtai and his hands are on the door, ready to shove it open by force, but then there\u2019s a fission of energy around the Mingshi and the wood burns beneath his hands, forcing him back.</p>\n<p>He looks at the red welts on his palms in disbelief. This isn\u2019t the ghost sword. This is Wu Yingtai. She\u2019s just locked herself inside with the malevolent sword spirit. He tries to break through her barrier and fails, no matter how he tries to shatter it. He\u2019d probably be impressed if he had the room underneath the thrum of panic in his veins. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s powerful, it\u2019s that it\u2019s complicated, which means he can\u2019t brute force his way through it. He tries to focus on the thrum of the barrier around the Mingshi, looking for a weak spot, but none makes themselves obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of the way!\u201d He looks up and Jiang Wanyin is beside him, scowling and furious and scared underneath all of that. \u201cStop that, it\u2019s not a barrier, that won\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>He steps back, having it bite his tongue to keep from contradicting him.</p>\n<p>Some of that mush show on his face because he snorts even as he drags his fingers through the air in what looks like a nonsense pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s not a barrier, it\u2019s a lock. It needs a key.\u201d Jiang Wanyin flicks the nonsense talisman forward and it dissolves. When he shoves the door open, nothing stops him.</p>\n<p>They both step inside, hands on their swords. Wu Yingtai is standing between Uncle and the ghost sword, her hands bloody, talisman paper fluttering around the floor, and her grey eyes burning. \u201cZidian!\u201d she shouts, a talisman held between her fingers.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. The purple whips arcs out in front of them with a crackle of power as she sends the talisman forward, both their actions perfectly in time so Zidian strikes the ghost sword just as the talisman touches it. There\u2019s a bright flash of light and when it fades the pressure of resentment energy lifts from the air, making it suddenly easier to breathe, \u00a0and leaves the ghost sword floating gently in the middle of the room, docile for the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying, what the fuck?\u201d Jiang Wanyin demands.</p>\n<p>She grins and there\u2019s blood on her teeth. \u201cWhat, was I supposed to let the kids handle it? They\u2019re babies, A-Cheng, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes and any response he\u2019d have to that is cut off by Jin Ling running to her. She lifts her arm just in time to catch him against her side, letting him bury his face into her shoulder. \u201cAunt Ying! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, sorry A-Ling, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d she says, rubbing a soothing hand down his back.</p>\n<p>He pushes her away and rubs at his eyes. \u201cWho said I was scared? I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks to Jiang Wanyin and they share a warm, exasperated glance. \u201cOf course not, A-Ling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle is finally getting to his feet, a disciple on either side, and Lan Wangji should go to him but he can\u2019t bring himself to move, can barely make himself breathe. He feels as if he\u2019s holding onto his control by his fingertips and he\u2019s afraid any sudden movements will cause it to snap.</p>\n<p>The junior disciples are filling the room. Sizhui and Jingyi don\u2019t maintain a respectful distance, instead rushing towards Wu Yingtai in a way that\u2019s not dissimilar to Jin Ling. \u201cLady Wu, are you alright?\u201d Sizhui asks, his face creased in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should think before you act!\u201d Jingyi shouts, breaking eight clan rules about propriety at once. \u201cWhat if something had happened to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>They know her. Somehow in her past two weeks in Cloud Recesses, Wu Yingtai has found time to become familiar with his son and Jingyi, to the point where they feel comfortable enough approach her instead of politely hanging back. That isn\u2019t necessarily unusual for Jingyi but is for Sizhui.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you to call me my name,\u201d she scolds gently, folding her sleeve over her bloody hands so she can reach forward and wipe away the blood at the corner of Sizhui\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m fine boys, really, there\u2019s no need to cause a fuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think of it really, but one moment he\u2019s breathing carefully through his nose and the next his hand is wrapped around the wrist of the hand that she\u2019s not using to clean his son\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji!\u201d Jiang Wanyin snaps, Zidian sparking up his arm. \u201cGet away from her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, A-Cheng,\u201d she says absently, meeting his gaze without a hint of fear but plenty of concern. \u201cIs everything alright, Hanguang Jun?\u201d</p>\n<p>He lifts her hand up between them. There\u2019s a thick cut across her palm that\u2019s still sluggishly bleeding. Had she grasped the sword by the blade? Was that the cry of pain he\u2019d heard from her? Foolish. \u201cYou should not have interfered. It was not your place.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes, obstinate and arrogant and not <em>listening</em>. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t mean to get involved in clan business or whatever, but I wasn\u2019t just going stand there and watch! I\u2019m weak, Hanguang Jun, not useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, so weak,\u201d Jingyi mutters sarcastically, glancing at the ghost sword. Sizhui elbows him without looking at him.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai absently tucks a strand of Sizhui\u2019s hair behind his ear, coming dangerously close to touching his forehead ribbon. His son doesn\u2019t even flinch, though Jingyi does. She turns to face him fully, putting her other wounded hand on top of his. She\u2019s still bleeding, making a mess of both of them, but it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t even notice. \u201cCome on, relax, it\u2019s not a big deal. I was just trying to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tightens his grip, too firm, enough that he knows he\u2019ll leave behind bruises in the shape of his fingers on her skin. His rage isn\u2019t justified. The blood pounding in his ears and the fury under his skin is out of proportion to her actions. He hasn\u2019t been this angry since \u2013 since \u2013</p>\n<p>She stumbles as he yanks his hands back, turning and walking out of the Mingshi, walking away from her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun!\u201d she calls out, but he doesn\u2019t pause and he doesn\u2019t look back.</p>\n<p>Of all his faults, Lan Wangji has never considered disloyalty to be among them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cShe saved my life,\u201d Uncle says to him as they watch the Jiangs leave Cloud Recesses. Wu Yingtai leaves as she came, walking by Jiang Wanyin\u2019s side, although the cheeriness in her voice doesn\u2019t ring as totally genuine. Wangji had refused to leave the Jingshi to bid their guests goodbye and Wu Yingtai had sulked, begging to be allowed to go and apologize, which Lan Xichen had been forced to refuse.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin had been furious at Wangji\u2019s slight against Wu Yingtai in a way he\u2019d never truly gotten worked up about Wangji\u2019s disrespect when it was directed at himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cHer insights into the ghost sword\u2019s origins were impressive,\u201d he says. A weak cultivator she may be, but her wider knowledge of cultivation and her talisman skills more than made up for it. Between that and her cheerful temperament, she\u2019ll surely make an excellent wife to Jiang Wanyin.</p>\n<p>He dreads receiving that invitation. The whole main Lan family will be expected to attend something as high profile as a sect leader\u2019s wedding and it will be difficult to explain Wangji\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe likes her,\u201d he says helplessly. Wangji enjoys the company of so few people that even that would be remarkable, but this is something he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever see again, something he hasn\u2019t seen even a hint of in the past thirteen years.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s there again, like Wangji is fifteen years old again and just discovering what want is. It\u2019s desire and protectiveness and affection too overwhelming to be anything but painful.</p>\n<p>Sizhui likes her too. It\u2019s <em>almost</em> perfect.</p>\n<p>Uncle\u2019s lips press together. \u201cShe is not his to like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen has no response to that, because of course Uncle is right. Wu Yingtai is obviously if not publicly engaged to Jiang Wanyin. There\u2019s nothing to be done about it.</p>\n<p>Maybe she and Wangji can at least be friends, one day.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gives into the urge to look behind him back up the steps to Cloud Recesses. He knows it\u2019s dangerous, that there are too many things about him that threaten to give his true identity away, that clearly Lan Zhan despises him as much as ever, but he can\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>He hopes he sees Lan Zhan again soon.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is worried.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Wei Wuxian\u2019s ritual managed to fix whatever Mo Xuanyu had gotten wrong so he\u2019s more firmly settled in his body, so Mo Xuanyu's core is finally stable if weak, and he's stronger than he was and steadily gaining weight, the bruises under his eyes finally fading.</p>\n<p>The bad news is there\u2019s still one curse mark across his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this kid\u2019s deal was,\u201d Wei Wuxian says moodily, slumped over the table in his rooms as they work their way through the third bottle of wine. His brother\u2019s tolerance isn\u2019t quite what it was in his previous body, but it\u2019s not far off either. \u201cCouldn\u2019t he have left some clear instructions? Here\u2019s a hit list, thanks so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even end up killing them,\u201d he points out. Lan Xichen had told them the events behind the ghost sword, which had explained the three missing curse marks but just made the whole thing even more baffling. \u201cIf this kid was a good enough demonic cultivator to summon you, he probably could have killed his family on his own too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian snorts. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like he did a perfect job of the whole summoning me part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he did that part fine. It was the binding part that tripped him up, and it\u2019s certainly more than I could do.\u201d He had no interest in demonic cultivation, now or ever, but he\u2019d been fourth in their classes at Cloud Recesses, right behind Jin Zixuan. He wasn\u2019t an idiot.</p>\n<p>His brother nods grudgingly, pulling his leg to his chest so he can rest his chin on his knee. \u201cWhat if the fourth mark is for a good person? His family seems as if they were terrible, I might have been killed them and not felt too bad about it, but what if he didn\u2019t have a good reason for the last one? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to undo the curse mark without it killing me anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne problem at a time,\u201d he says sharply then takes a long sip of wine.</p>\n<p>Thirteen years ago he\u2019s acted thoughtlessly and sent his brother tumbling over a cliff, killing when he\u2019d only meant to injure.</p>\n<p>If the fourth mark is for someone Wei Wuxian can\u2019t bring himself to kill, Jiang Cheng will do it for him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d killed his brother once. He\u2019d killed Wei Wuxian after A-jie had died to save him, dishonoring her sacrifice. What sin could be worse than that? Whose life could be more precious than that of his brother who their sister had died for?</p>\n<p>What wouldn\u2019t he be willing to do in order to ensure one of his worst mistakes remains undone?</p>\n<p>Very little.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jin Ling can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s glad that Wei Wuxian is accompanying him on the night hunt or if he\u2019s annoyed by it. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby, you know,\u201d he mutters. He\u2019s thirteen, and a good cultivator. He\u2019d more than old enough to go on night hunts on his own, especially ones like these. It\u2019s probably a poltergeist if it\u2019s anything.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hums, flipping a dagger absently over and under his hand. His new golden core isn\u2019t strong enough for him to wield a sword and he can\u2019t carry his flute around outside of Lotus Pier, so he\u2019s taken to carrying daggers. He\u2019d claimed not to have fought with them often, but from what Jin Ling has seen of his spars it didn\u2019t look that way. \u201cI wasn\u2019t night hunting alone at your age, A-Ling. Besides, I need to take a break from researching before I go mad. You wouldn\u2019t deny your poor uncle a bit of break, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Ling ignores the question to say, \u201cYou were with Uncle, it\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slides the dagger back into his sleeves, tighter against his wrist than his normal billowy ones just in case they came across trouble. He claimed that he didn\u2019t like large sleeves getting in the way when he was fighting, but he still had his hair mostly down, and Jin Ling thought that had to be worse. Wei Wuxian said he was too impatient for any of the complicated feminine styles, but personally Jin Ling thinks that extra couple minutes would have been worth it just to get the hair out of his way. \u201cYour grandfather followed us on all those hunts, actually. He didn\u2019t tell us until we were older, obviously, we would have been pissed if we knew at the time. But he hid and watched us, just in case we needed help. I\u2019m just doing it out in the open. I prefer not to sneak, I\u2019m not all that good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lie, but Jin Ling doesn\u2019t focus on that. Sometimes he feels like he\u2019s learned more about his family these past couple months than in the past thirteen years. Wei Wuxian talks casually and frequently of people Uncle only mentions when he's desperately sad or drunk or some combination thereof. It\u2019s nice to hear about people in a way that isn\u2019t so heavy, to just know something about his grandfather without feeling like the information is being handed to him covered in blood. \u201cWell if he didn\u2019t interfere, then you shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles at him, warm and fond. Jin Ling is used to reading Uncle\u2019s affections in hundred different ways, but it\u2019s nice that Wei Wuxian\u2019s is so easy, so obvious and plentiful. \u201cI won\u2019t, A-Ling. Unless something goes terribly wrong, it\u2019ll be like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, right. He swallows anymore complaints, because Uncle <em>has</em> been worried over how much Wei Wuxian has up late researching and what little he\u2019s found, so it\u2019s probably worth the trouble of keeping Fairy at home and letting Wei Wuxian tag along if it gives him a break. He\u2019s probably, possibly more useful than Fairy on a night hunt anyway. \u201cWhatever, Uncle Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Sizhui is the highest ranked disciple here which means he can\u2019t panic. He has to be calm and clear headed and he has to get them out of here. But the fog is thick and there\u2019s something in the sky and now the Ouyang disciples are looking at him, thick faced but obviously afraid, and he doesn\u2019t know how to tell them that he doesn\u2019t know what to do.</p>\n<p>The ominous tapping isn\u2019t around anymore, at least. He thinks that\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Jingyi mutters out of the corner of his mouth, quietly enough that no one else hears him. Jingyi can be quiet when he wants to be, which is almost never. \u201cWe\u2019re just lost, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>He presses his lips together. He can\u2019t unsay something, after all, and he doesn\u2019t want to argue about this. He doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to be strong for Jingyi in the way he does for the other disciples, but that doesn\u2019t change that he wants to be.</p>\n<p>When they come across two figures in the mist he draws his sword and viciously stuffs down his fear. Then a familiar voice calls out, \u201cAre those Lans I see or ghosts? It\u2019s hard to tell in all this mist.\u201d</p>\n<p>His knees nearly go weak with relief. Wu Yingtai is here, Jin Ling at her side with his hand on his sword and an uncertain scowl hovering around his mouth. She\u2019s dressed similar to how she was at Cloud Recesses, her hair down and a thick purple ribbon around her throat, but her robes are sturdier and darker, a richer purple than the pale lavender she\u2019d worn, and the sleeves are trim against her wrists.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Wu!\u201d Jingyi says, slipping back into formality in his surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou first,\u201d she says cheerfully but in a way that leaves no room for argument. Sizhui fills her in as quickly as he can while trying not to self examine too much.</p>\n<p>It makes sense for him to be relieved that she\u2019s here. She\u2019s older than them and knows far more about cultivation than they do and is quite good at talismans. But true as that may be, she\u2019s not a strong cultivator, and the way her mere presence has softened the edges of his fear makes no sense at all.</p>\n<p>She frowns, tapping her bottom lip, her eyes far away. \u201cAunt Ying?\u201d Jin Ling asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange,\u201d she says, but if she\u2019s worried, she doesn\u2019t look it. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for us all to get lost in this mist. We should stick together.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea that they wouldn\u2019t stay together, that Wu Yingtai wouldn\u2019t stay and help them, hadn\u2019t even occurred to him. It should have, she\u2019s a Jiang disciple and under no obligation to assist a Lan or Ouyang night hunt, but it hadn\u2019t. Maybe that doesn\u2019t mean anything. Clearly his trust hadn\u2019t been misplaced, after all.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re quiet as they walk, all of them tense but her. She walks as if this is any other stroll through a town, even though it\u2019s empty and everything\u2019s closed and thick mist is everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook!\u201d Ouyang Zizhen shouts, already drawing his sword.</p>\n<p>They all turn and Sizhui feels the bottom of his stomach drop out.</p>\n<p>Two dozen fierce corpses are stumbling towards them. That\u2019s too many. They\u2019d each have to fight multiple fierce corpses at once, in this mist, where they can as easily hurt an ally as they can an enemy. Everyone frantically pulls for their swords anyway, because they\u2019re certainly not going to die without a fight, but Wu Yingtai raises a lazy hand and says, \u201cHold.\u201d</p>\n<p>They pause, waiting. He wonders if they would all have as easily obeyed any senior that found them, or if it was something special about Wu Yingtai that got such easy obedience. He\u2019s inclined to say it's the latter, but he thinks he might be biased.</p>\n<p>She sketches a talisman in the air, one Sizhui doesn\u2019t recognize, then snaps her fingers. The talisman dissolves and the fierce corpses freeze in place. He only has a moment for the relief to sweep through him before they break through whatever spell she\u2019s cast and start moving again. \u201cAh,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying,\u201d Jin Ling says, clearly not as quietly as he intends, \u201ccan you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she says, cutting him off. Jin Ling scowls but nods even though she\u2019s not looking at him, still watching the slowly approaching corpses. She pulls out a sheaf of talisman paper from her robe and leans over, casually slicing her finger on Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s blade before he can pull it away from her. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to get close to them instead, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Jingyi says flatly. \u201cLet us-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Hack at them with your swords?\u201d She\u2019s teasing them. Surely things can\u2019t be that dire if she\u2019s teasing them. \u201cTheir flesh is already dead. What do you think your steel will do?\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t sound quite right. \u201cWe have cultivation blades. Surely the spiritual energy will destroy them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpiritual energy does break them down, eventually,\u201d she allows, eyeing the rapidly approaching fierce corpses with what he feels like might not be the appropriate amount of concern. \u201cBut it would take a concentrated strike to do more than irritate them. Frankly, no one here has the power for that kind of approach.\u201d She looks over her talismans with a critical eye. Seemingly satisfied, she sticks her bleeding finger in her mouth then reaches out to poke Jin Ling in the forehead with it. \u201cStay here. If I die, run.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Ling\u2019s eyes widen in alarm. Sizhui can feels his doing the same. \u201cAunt Ying!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to die, relax,\u201d she says, laughing as she heads <em>towards</em> the angry mob of fierce corpses. \u201cSo serious!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we stop her?\u201d Jingyi asks anxiously. \u201cShe\u2019s not even carrying a sword!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing, shut up,\u201d Jin Ling snaps, but he\u2019s gripping his sword hard enough that his knuckles have turned white.</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t want to stand there doing nothing. Wu Yingtai\u2019s movements are confident and unflinching, but he can\u2019t help but remember the way her hands had shaken after she\u2019d fallen from the tree.</p>\n<p>When she gets close, she casts the same talisman as before and when she snaps her fingers the fierce corpses come to a halt. It hadn\u2019t lasted long last time and it doesn\u2019t look like she expects it to last this time either. She quickly darts between the corpses, slapping talismans onto them and then getting out of range. As one they take a shuddering, flinching movement and Sizhui is certain that it hasn\u2019t worked, that Wu Yingtai\u2019s plan has failed and they\u2019re going to have to come up with something else.</p>\n<p>Then she smiles and snaps her fingers once more. The fierce corpses turn on each other, as if they no longer see them all standing there. They descend on each other with a savagery that turns his stomach, dead flesh falling to the ground in handfuls while those who\u2019d had tools start slicing through their fellow fierce corpses blindly.</p>\n<p>Jingyi swallows. \u201cI thought you said steel wouldn\u2019t work against them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I?\u201d she asks cheerfully. It\u2019s hard to tell in the mist, but he thinks maybe she\u2019s paler than she was before. Talismans rely more on construction than power to make them work, but he doesn\u2019t think whatever she just did could have been easy. If it had been, everyone would be doing it, and he\u2019s never even heard of talismans that can be used against fierce corpses. \u201cProbably I just meant that steel wouldn\u2019t do much good if the wielder is dead before they can make use of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s standing in front of them again, smiling and perfectly relaxed, and Sizhui doesn\u2019t even register that something is wrong until Wu Yingtai\u2019s back is to them, two daggers he hadn\u2019t seen her carrying crossed in front of her to halt the blade of the sword inches from her face. She\u2019s <em>fast</em>. He\u2019s still processing it when the masked man who\u2019d attacked her ducks backwards, which means he\u2019s barely paying any attention when he hears the strong chords of a zither. A bolt of concentrated spiritual energy lands in front of them, obliterating the last of the fierce corpses and pushing the masked man away from them.</p>\n<p>Sizhui recognizes his father\u2019s spiritual energy and doesn\u2019t slump down in relief, but only because it would be undignified.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun!\u201d Wu Yingtai calls out gleefully, waving her daggers in greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d Jingyi asks excitedly, turning his head frantically. The rest of the disciples do the same, as if it will make A-die appear out of thin air.</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t see him through the mist. But Wu Yingtai knows he\u2019s there anyway, able to pick up on his presence through his spiritual energy alone when even the other Lan disciples hadn\u2019t been able to.</p>\n<p>Strange.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have much time to think on it before A-die lands in front of them. Jingyi is coughing and a terrible scent enters his nose, but Sizhui is having a hard time focusing on that. Instead he meets his father\u2019s gaze evenly, hoping he doesn\u2019t look as out of sorts as he feels. This night hunt has gone so sideways, not even just poorly, but weird, and he\u2019s eager for it to be over.</p>\n<p>The question in A-die\u2019s eyes is obvious so he shakes his head and says, \u201cNo one\u2019s hurt. Lady Wu protected us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo formal? You\u2019ll break my heart,\u201d she says, but instead of coming out as a whine it\u2019s almost absentminded. She\u2019s looking over A-die\u2019s shoulder and she says, \u201cI\u2019ll countdown for you, hmm, Hanguang Jun?\u201d Sizhui has no idea what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cThree\u2026 two\u2026 two and a half\u2026 one!\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die swings in place, sword first, neatly deflecting a blow from the masked man. The force of it sends him to the other side of the street.</p>\n<p>How had she done that? Sizhui hadn\u2019t even been able to see the masked man. Had A-die really listened to her or had he also sensed something that Sizhui couldn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou take care of him, I\u2019ll take care of the kids, yeah?\u201d she offers.</p>\n<p>A-die\u2019s eyes glance over them, lingering on Jingyi who\u2019s struggling to stay upright. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoison, I know.\u201d There\u2019s a wave of shocked cries and Jingyi\u2019s fingers dig into his wrist. \u201cIf you want to take the kids, I suppose I can fight that guy, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll last long.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die shakes his head. \u201cI should not have attacked them. You had the situation handled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai flushes, maybe. It\u2019s hard to tell with all the mist. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, how could you know? It\u2019s an easy enough fix. You do your thing, I\u2019ll do mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d A-die says, then inclines his head slightly more than Sizhui has seen him to do anyone outside of a conference or official meeting. \u201cThank you, Wu Yingtai.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and goes after the masked man before she can reply. She\u2019s definitely blushing now.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying,\u201d Jin Ling hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight! Right, let\u2019s go, we have to go,\u201d she says, making shooing motions with her hands, which is possibly a more threatening gesture than she thought it\u2019d be since she\u2019s still holding the daggers.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is worried things have gotten slightly out of hand, although he\u2019s less worried than he was before Lan Zhan showed up. Even if he did accidentally give some of the kids corpse sickness, but Wei Wuxian can cure that easily enough. He would have had a much harder time fighting the masked man out there without resorting to some very obvious demonic cultivation.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling loudly complains about making the congee, but he knows it\u2019s just because he\u2019s scared, so he doesn\u2019t bother to scold him all that much for it. There will be time for lectures on manners when they get out of this mess. Preferably from someone who isn\u2019t him, since there\u2019s no way Jin Ling will take him seriously. He knows him too well for that.</p>\n<p>Maybe he could get Lan Zhan to do it. He\u2019s always had a good face for scolding.</p>\n<p>The almost dead ghost girl doesn\u2019t seem to fit in with the rest of this town. There\u2019s something <em>wrong </em>here, more than the obvious, and it\u2019s bothering him that he can\u2019t put his finger on it. The kids are cured and no one\u2019s hurt and he knows they should just wait for Lan Zhan to finish fighting the masked guy \u2013 another piece of this already odd puzzle that doesn\u2019t fit quite right \u2013 but as the minutes tick by his restlessness sours into worry. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he orders the kids. \u201cI\u2019m going to check on something. Don\u2019t do anything until I get back.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIf something walks through that door that\u2019s not me or Hanguang Jun, strike first and ask questions later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome<em>thing</em>?\u201d Jingyi squawks indignantly.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t answer him, closing the door behind him and resisting the urge to put up some protection talismans. He wasn\u2019t that much older than they are when he fought in a war, after all.</p>\n<p>That makes him want to go back there and cover them in protection talismans, actually. These kids have probably never even killed another human being, not one that wasn\u2019t cursed or possessed or dead already.</p>\n<p>He wants to keep it that way, if he can.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take him long to find Lan Zhan, but when he does, fury licks up his bones, like he\u2019s on the battlefield once more. He wonders if this is a nightmare, but he thinks if were, it would hurt more.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is fighting three to one. The masked man, and Xue Yang, who should be dead but isn\u2019t, and the fierce corpse of Song Lan, who isn\u2019t alive but should be. Lan Zhan is holding his own, but it\u2019s a struggle. If something doesn\u2019t tip the fight in his favor soon, they\u2019re going to be in trouble.</p>\n<p>He reaches for his quiankun pouch, where Chenqing lies waiting, but he hesitates. He can\u2019t. If Lan Zhan sees him with Chenqing, he\u2019ll know, but he doesn\u2019t have anything else. He <em>could</em> do it through whistling, but that\u2019s almost as much of a tell as using Chenqing. It\u2019s not like there are exactly a lot of people who could manage musical cultivation with just their voices, especially not up against demonic energies.</p>\n<p>Of course if it comes down to his secrets or Lan Zhan\u2019s life, it\u2019s no choice at all, but there has to be something else, some other solution to this than \u2013</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>The Lans. He has a whole bunch of little Lans back there.</p>\n<p>He runs, even though he shouldn\u2019t, even though he\u2019ll be even more useless if he gets corpse poisoning, but this is important. Every moment he wastes is another moment where Lan Zhan could get hurt. He bursts back into the room, chest heaving, and demands, \u201cWho brough an instrument?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s face scrunches in confusion, which would be funny in different circumstances.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstruments. A xiao would be preferred, but I\u2019ll take literally anything.\u201d A dizi would be excellent, but he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s considered too lowborn for the Lan elders. \u201cExcept a zither.\u201d He may be a genius, but he\u2019s still a mortal man. Trying to make thirty four strings obey him on the fly is asking a little much of himself. Then again, if it\u2019s his only option, he\u2019ll manage.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us have progressed enough to be allowed to take our instruments on night hunts,\u201d says one of the Lan disciples, and he bites back a frustrated scream. That\u2019s probably a logical thing to regulate when they\u2019re not in the middle of a war, but it\u2019s really inconvenient for him right now.</p>\n<p>Jingyi elbows Sizhui in the side, who winces as he edges away from him, but says, \u201cI have.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an embarrassed flush across his cheeks. Wei Wuxian would pinch them if he had the time. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches into his quinkun bag and pulls out a guqin. Not a xiao, but it only has seven strings. He can work with that.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian moves to grab it, but hesitates. He can feel from here that it\u2019s not quite a first class spiritual tool, like Lan Zhan\u2019s zither or his dizi, but it\u2019s close. \u201cCan I? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a wave of horrified reactions from the other Lans, but he ignores them. It\u2019s not their opinion that matters right now. Sizhui\u2019s nod is firm, but he looks uncertain. \u201cIf it\u2019ll let you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lifts it into his hands. There\u2019s a current of warmth between his palms, but no pain, and the strings each pluck themselves as if in greeting. \u201cThank you. Stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is almost impressed at how so much has gone wrong so quickly. He\u2019d been fighting the masked man fine on his own, but then assistance had come in the shape of what he\u2019d thought was Xiao Xingchen, blinded but no less deadly for his lack of sight. But then he\u2019d started talking about needing help with a soul, saying he needed a demonic cultivator\u2019s help, which had been strange and unsettling enough all on its own.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019d asked for Wei Ying and Lan Wangji had known that this was not Xiao Xingchen. He\u2019d come across the man, once, years before. Xiao Xingchen had mourned Wei Ying, his martial nephew. He\u2019d squeezed Lan Wangji\u2019s hands with a sympathy that had been so warm it stung, the only person who\u2019d ever looked at him and both recognized his grief and hadn\u2019t pitied him for it. That man would not mock him for his grief by demanding he hand over Wei Ying, as if that were even <em>possible. </em></p>\n<p>He\u2019d attacked, not a killing blow. If he was wrong, he\u2019d apologize appropriately. But he hadn\u2019t been. The person in front of him had peeled off Xiao Xingchen\u2019s face like a second skin, dropping it to the ground, and then he\u2019d had Xue Yang in front of him.</p>\n<p>Then Song Lan and the masked man had appeared, and he doesn\u2019t understand how all these pieces fit together, isn\u2019t sure what exactly is happening, but he doesn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. He should have killed the masked man when he had the chance, but he\u2019d been more interested in beating him into submission so he could interrogate him, and that had been a mistake. The masked man wasn\u2019t a danger to him, but now that Xue Yang and Song Lan are here, Lan Wangji has to consider the idea that this is a fight that he could lose.</p>\n<p>He dismisses the thought as soon as he has it. If he falls here, then others will be in danger. His son is here. The other juniors are here. Wu Yingtai is here. If he dies here, then they\u2019ll surely follow, and that\u2019s unacceptable.</p>\n<p>The first notes are so faint that he barely registers them. Then Song Lan stumbles, allowing him just enough room to cut him across both thighs.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s senses widen and he realizes there\u2019s music being played, energy trembling through the air. He can\u2019t afford to panic but his heart is in his throat as he ducks underneath Xue Yang\u2019s swing. Only one of the juniors has clearance to bring their instrument out of Cloud Recesses. He doesn\u2019t know where Sizhui could have learned this composition, the notes almost familiar but not quite like anything taught in the standard curriculum, but mostly he wants him as far away from this fight as possible.</p>\n<p>He turns, but instead of his son, Wu Yingtai is on her knees with Sizhui\u2019s guqin in front of her. That\u2019s something he\u2019ll have to hear about later, if there is a later. Even Jingyi doesn\u2019t touch his son\u2019s guqin these days, enough of his spiritual energy having settled into the instrument to make it inappropriate. She\u2019s far enough away not to be in immediate danger, but still too close to comfort. Her playing is shaky, her fingers clearly unused to the instrument as they stumble across the strings, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ineffective. He\u2019s never heard Rest played this <em>aggressively </em>before.</p>\n<p>The music slams into Song Lan, who\u2019s face twists into something between confusion and pain. His movements slow to a stutter, his limbs moving jerkily as if they\u2019re no longer under his control and it\u2019s easy for Lan Wangji to move the battle away from him. He doesn\u2019t follow, still caught in whatever Wu Yingtai has done to him. Rest isn\u2019t supposed to work like this, and now that he\u2019s listening he realizes it\u2019s not <em>exactly</em> Rest, although its very close. Lan Wangji manages a slash across the masked man\u2019s chest that would have been a killing blow if he had moved a hair\u2019s breath slower. As it is, red blood blooms across his chest, his grip on his sword faltering. He cocks his head to the side then disappears into the effects of a transportation talisman.</p>\n<p>Just like that, the fight is once more in his favor. Xue Yang is back by Song Lan, but for some reason he\u2019s staring at Wu Yingtai with a look Lan Wangji can\u2019t explain and doesn\u2019t like. \u201c<em>You!</em>\u201d he hisses, darting forward sword first.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai blanches, but her focus is still on Song Lan and her playing doesn\u2019t falter even as Xue Yang raises his sword above his head.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll die. Xue Yang is going to sever her head from her body and she\u2019ll be dead, her blood staining his son\u2019s guqin. Lan Wangji moves faster than he ever has, putting himself between them, and raises his sword to stab it through Xue Yang\u2019s chest, piercing his heart. Xue Yang dies with a snarl on his lips and surprise in eyes.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai is screaming. He means to turn, to assure her that everything is going to be okay, but he can\u2019t move and then her skinny arm is around his waist, slowly easing him to ground, for some reason.</p>\n<p>He tilts his head, looking down to see a sword sticking out of his stomach. \u201cAh,\u201d he says, and it comes out breathier than he\u2019d intended, a gasp more than a word.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em> was that?\u201d Wu Yingtai demands, kicking Xue Yang\u2019s corpse away from them and using her free hand to yank Bichen out of his chest. She doesn\u2019t clean his sword before sliding it back in its scabbard, but he supposes that it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Her hand is frantic against his back, then soothing as it rubs in a slow circle. \u201cOkay, well it didn\u2019t go through you, so there\u2019s that at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asks, breathing through the pain.</p>\n<p>She pauses in trying to push him down on the ground. \u201cAm <em>I</em> hurt? Are you fucking with me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Song Lan is still a threat, and she\u2019s stopped playing, so he could come over and attack her at any moment. If he\u2019s going to die, he wants to die knowing that everyone is safe.</p>\n<p>He tries to force himself to his feet and she lets out a sound that he thinks might count as a snarl. She grabs his shoulders and shoves him down onto his back, the move jostling him enough that the pain which had seemed distant is suddenly very present, forcing out a low grown that he clenches his teeth together in an attempt to suppress.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what was that?\u201d she asks snippily. \u201cCan you repeat it for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>In other circumstances, he\u2019d wouldn\u2019t allow himself this, but the pain has rubbed his control raw. He can\u2019t quite stop his mouth from pulling into a smile. Most people would be panicked in this situation, he thinks. She\u2019s mostly angry.</p>\n<p>Anger looks good on her.</p>\n<p>She stares at him for a moment, mouth open, before muttering, \u201cYou\u2019re so weird.\u201d Her hands are gentle as they press around his stomach. He breathes in and out carefully, attempting to let the pain pass through him. He turns his head, trying to figure out where Song Lan is, but she\u2019s blocking most of his view. \u201cThis could be worse, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she scowls. \u201cI have some medical training, okay, I had this friend who \u2013 well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him see,\u201d he says. He reaches up to grab her hand, ignoring the slickness of his blood covering it. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>She lets him hold her hand, her eyebrows pushed together. \u201cLet who see what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Sizhui see me die,\u201d he says. It\u2019s getting harder to talk, but he thinks that comes out clearly.</p>\n<p>If she was angry before, she\u2019s furious now. He thinks her grip on his hand would be painful if he had the capacity to feel pain anywhere besides his stomach. \u201cWho the fuck said you were allowed to die?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot remain here. The masked man is still here, as well as the fierce corpses. I cannot move with a sword in my stomach and as soon as you remove it I will bleed out,\u201d he says. He has a strong golden core but even he can\u2019t out heal blood loss. \u201cEither leave me here or finish it quickly and get the juniors to safety. One of the men wore the face of another, so you must trust no one, as they could be someone else. You can come back for my body when it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only thing they can do. He tries not to think of his uncle, of his brother, of his son who\u2019s not quite fully grown.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll get to see Wei Ying soon. There\u2019s that, at least. Perhaps dying is not so terrible if it means he gets to see Wei Ying again. He\u2019ll be able to tell him about their son.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai pulls out a piece of talisman paper, using his blood on her hands to sketch a design into. He hopes it\u2019s something that will kill him quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen this is over,\u201d she says fiercely, \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches up to grip the handle of the sword and yanks it out in one hard, smooth motion. His vision goes black and he feels her slapping the talisman against his wound, then there\u2019s a painful heat and the sizzling of flesh.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s too unprepared to muffle the scream that rips itself from his throat. Her hand is cool against his cheek and then it all goes black.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He should have just used Chenqing. At least then Lan Zhan would have known not to get in the way, would have known that Wei Wuxian could be deadly enough with seven strings that he didn\u2019t need to stupidly take a sword to the gut.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t leave Lan Zhan here alone, bloody and unconscious and still faintly smoking, but he told the kids not to leave. He sends a paperman to Jin Ling, trusting his impulsive nephew to follow it and for everyone else to be too responsible to let a thirteen year old go running off on his own.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t pulled his left hand back quickly enough from the talisman and it aches, the skin red and tender. He\u2019ll still be able to play with it if he has to, but it\u2019s not going to be pleasant.</p>\n<p>Song Lan is still standing there, unmoving, and he\u2019s itching to investigate, to figure out what the hell is going on with everyone in this town, but Lan Zhan comes first. His face is slack now, at least, which is better than the pained grimace. It\u2019s like being back in the Xuanwu\u2019s cave when they were kids, except he thinks they\u2019re in a slightly better position this time around.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not. He doesn\u2019t just have an injured Lan Zhan to take care of, he has a couple dozen juniors to protect from someone who\u2019s injured but still alive and, going by what Lan Zhan said, has the ability to change faces.</p>\n<p>The juniors come storming around the corner. Everyone but Jin Ling stops short at the sight of them, the Lans gaping at the sight of Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling doesn\u2019t give a shit, bless him. \u201cAunt Ying!\u201d He falls onto his knees next to him and grabs his arm, tugging on it in a way that makes him wince, but Jin Ling\u2019s so freaked out that he can\u2019t bring himself to scold him for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says soothingly, reaching out to pat his shoulder. \u201cGood job on following the paperman, that\u2019s what I wanted you to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a wet, choked gasp from next to him and he turns to see Sizhui standing there, eyes wet and mouth trembling.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, no,\u201d he says, wrapping his burned and throbbing hand around Sizhui\u2019s forearm. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, and we\u2019re going to keep him that way, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s,\u201d Sizhui starts, then stops, dropping down on his other side. He reaches for Lan Zhan\u2019s hand, finding his pulse with shaking fingers. He swallows and bows his head, pressing the back of Lan Zhan\u2019s hand against his forehead and knocking his ribbon out of place, not that he seems to notice. He stays like that for a moment, taking two slow breaths, then carefully lowers Lan Zhan\u2019s hand back to the ground. When Sizhui turns to him, there\u2019s an earnest determination there that pulls a smile from Wei Wuxian, despite everything. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>The other juniors surround them, the Lans too pale at the sight of Lan Zhan but all of them equally resolute.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian loves these kids.</p>\n<p>\u201cFind a cart, we can\u2019t carry him without aggravating his wound. Be quick, and careful, one of the men he was fighting got away. Ignore Song Lan \u2013 that fierce corpse over there \u2013 we don\u2019t have the time to deal with him now.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to outright kill him if he doesn\u2019t have to. He wants answers first. \u201cIf you see someone, anyone, send up a flare and I\u2019ll come to you. Understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Two Lans and one of the Ouyang disciples go off in search of a cart.</p>\n<p>First a cart, then an inn where he might be able to actually protect them, and then they\u2019ll have to send out messages for help.</p>\n<p>He swallows, letting his gaze drop to Lan Zhan, to his ruined robes and hair and the shallow rise and fall of his chest.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan just has to keep breathing. Wei Wuxian will do the rest.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He wakes up in an incredible amount of pain, but considering he hadn\u2019t expected to wake up at all, it seems a petty complaint.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s partially upright, leaning against a wall, and Wu Yingtai\u2019s arms are around him and her hair is in his face. She leans back, tugging on something that causes his breath to hitch in pain, and then she\u2019s looking at him. \u201cOh no, I was hoping you\u2019d sleep through this,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks, taking stock of their surroundings. They\u2019re in a room, likely rented. He\u2019s shirtless and pressed against her as she winds bandages around his torso and, even considering the circumstances, he can\u2019t stop the flush of heat along his ears. She\u2019s so close, closer than she\u2019s been since the first time they met, when he\u2019d held her body against his to keep her from falling.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth but she presses her fingers against his lips, shocking him into silence. Her skin is soft and he has clamp down on the impulse to bite her. \u201cEveryone\u2019s okay, you\u2019re the only one stupid enough to get hurt. I put up wards and as soon as I\u2019m done with you, I\u2019ll go out and keep watch. Sizhui and Jingyi are out there right now, but I told them to yell for me if anything happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s harder than it should be to turn his head towards her, pulling away from her touch so he can speak. He thinks possibly the decision backfired, because now her fingers are pressing into his cheek and he\u2019s looking straight at her, their faces far too close. He\u2019d been prepared to die and join Wei Ying and instead he\u2019d woken up in Wu Yingtai\u2019s arms. The shame is at war with exhaustion, with how she\u2019d protected the juniors and come looking for him, with how she\u2019d saved his life and is here now, smiling at him while trying to keep him alive. This would be easier if she were less \u2026 if she were just <em>less</em> than this.</p>\n<p>He thinks Wei Ying would have liked her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep watch,\u201d he says, bracing himself against the wall to get to his feet. He can feel his golden core already at work at healing the wound and she and the juniors need a break.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d she says cheerfully then slaps a talisman against his chest.</p>\n<p>The last thing he feels before being pulled into unconsciousness is her hand coming up to cradle the back of his head as it tips back, narrowly preventing him from smacking it into the wall.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When the Jin messenger butterfly lands on his desk, Lan Xichen thinks it\u2019s from A-Yao. But the message has Sizhui\u2019s seal and is written by Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>He barely has the presence of mind to inform his uncle before summoning four senior disciples and stepping onto his sword. They\u2019re safe enough for now. Wu Yingtai is intelligent and has a couple dozen skilled juniors at her disposal. She\u2019ll set up some sort of rotating guard duty, she won\u2019t leave their backs open. He\u2019s sure they\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>They have to be fine.</p>\n<p>The journey should take twelve hours by sword. They make it there in ten and it\u2019s the middle of the night when they land in front of what could generously be called an inn. Lan Xichen tries not to resent the speed of the senior disciples. He would have gotten here faster on his own, but this isn\u2019t the type of situation he should enter alone, no matter how much he wants to be by Wangji\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>The innkeeper takes one look at them and points up the stairs with a trembling hand. \u201cThey\u2019re up there. Be careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>He <em>wants</em> to go rushing up the stairs but he pauses. That\u2019s not the reaction he expected. \u201cWhat do you mean, my lady?\u201d</p>\n<p>She flinches, looking down. \u201cThat woman \u2013 we \u2013 they already paid. She said they\u2019d clean the walls before they left.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of that makes sense but it does shove his heart up that couple extra inches into his throat. There\u2019s no use standing here trying to guess what she means. They\u2019ll just have to see for themselves.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen goes up the stairs first but stops abruptly when he gets to the top. No wonder the innkeeper had been terrified.</p>\n<p>The hallway is narrow and short with only three rooms on each side. Talismans line the wall along with talisman markings directly on the wall and floor, drawn in a substance that\u2019s glistening a little too brightly in the candlelight to be ink. He can feel the fission of power from here, almost like heatwave that\u2019s just out of reach. These are powerful wards. He thinks they might even be more powerful than the ones that encircle Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai is kneeling in the center of the hallway, just behind the barrier line. There are deep bruises under her eyes and her robes are covered in dark stains. She has one hand poised over a stack of talismans and the other above a swirling talisman line along the wall. All of her fingers have barely healed cuts across them.</p>\n<p>Her grey eyes are stone. It sends a chill down his spine.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he should have expected this. Perhaps it was foolish of them to think Jiang Wanyin, the son of the Violet Spider, would be content with a woman who\u2019s merely beautiful and clever. Perhaps they should have known that she\u2019d also be deadly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d assumed she\u2019d use the disciples to keep them safe. Perhaps that was foolish too, to think that the woman who\u2019d sealed herself in with the ghost sword would allow children to protect her, would hide behind them instead of placing herself in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu Jun,\u201d she says, her voice absent any trace of the warmth he\u2019d become accustomed to hearing. \u201cApologies for the precaution, but it seems as if we\u2019re avoiding a man who can take others\u2019 faces for his own.\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for him to respond to that, instead raising her voice and calling out, \u201cSizhui!\u201d</p>\n<p>The door closest to her slides open and his nephew steps out. His clothes are rumbled and the skin around his eyes is pulled tight, but he\u2019s whole and unharmed and it becomes that much easier to breathe. Sizhui\u2019s face slackens in relief when he sees him, but he only takes half a step towards him before freezing and tensing once more. \u201cZewu Jun,\u201d he says respectfully. \u201cWhat did my father give me for my tenth birthday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour guqin,\u201d he answers, but instead of relaxing his nephew tenses even more. He shakes his head and Wu Yingtai\u2019s hand twitches toward the incomplete line of the talisman. He assumes he doesn\u2019t want to know what happens when she completes it. \u201cSizhui, he did, right in front of,\u201d all of us, he thinks but doesn\u2019t finish. There were too many witnesses, it was too easily known for that to an acceptable question to confirm he\u2019s not an imposter. He wasn\u2019t there for this part but he knows it\u2019s true. \u201cHe gave you spiritually charged strings from his own guqin.\u201d It was the type of gift that would only be acceptable between family and had happened when they were alone in the Jingshi. He\u2019d only found out later.</p>\n<p>Sizhui\u2019s shoulders slump and he rests a hand on Wu Yingtai\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p>She finally takes her cold eyes off him to look at Sizhui. He doesn\u2019t flinch from her gaze and she nods once, dropping her arms. She sketches out a talisman in the air too quickly for him to follow and flicks it forward. The hum of power disappears from the air and she slumps forward with a groan, rubbing her forehead.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen expects Sizhui to rush for him, but instead he drops down next to Wu Yingtai and wraps an arm around her shoulders, tilting her so she\u2019s leaning against his chest. \u201cAre you okay? Will you sleep now? You should have let us keep watch!\u201d He turns his head and shouts, \u201cJin Ling!\u201d</p>\n<p>That sounds as if Wu Yingtai, with her thin frame and weak golden core, has been sitting there refusing to rest and poised to strike since they arrived at the inn the day before.</p>\n<p>She reaches up to pat his arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t make such a fuss.\u201d Her voice is back to being warm but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever quite forget the way she\u2019d looked at him at first, as if his death were a foregone conclusion and she just hadn\u2019t yet decided how best to go about it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s too young to have fought in the war, but the way she\u2019d looked at him had almost seemed familiar, had almost seemed like something he\u2019d once seen on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>All the doors open, the juniors pouring out into the hallway. They step aside for Jin Ling, who\u2019s scowling at he holds out his hands. \u201cCome on, Aunt Ying. Backup is here and you need a nap.\u201d He\u2019s trying to tease but he\u2019s too worried for it to come out properly.</p>\n<p>She presses her lips together then looks up at Lan Xichen, a question in the tilt of her head. He nods. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep guard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d she mutters. She sketches out another talisman, flicking it against the wall. He flinches at the burst of flame as all the paper talismans turn to ash and the blood is scorched off the wall, ensuring that neither him nor his senior disciples will have the chance to study whatever it is she\u2019d done. She places her hands in Jin Ling\u2019s, and no matter how formidable she is, she\u2019s still too thin, although perhaps less so than when he saw her last. Jin Ling doesn\u2019t even struggle to pull her to her feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun first, then I\u2019ll sleep,\u201d she says. Jin Ling rolls his eyes but doesn\u2019t argue, although he does keep a firm hold of her arm. Sizhui pushes open the door to the room he\u2019d been in and Lan Xichen swallows before stepping inside.</p>\n<p>Wangji is lying on his back, stripped to just in his pants, his hair undone but his forehead ribbon still in place. The tight bandages around his torso are clearly from his robes, but he immediately focuses on the talisman on the center of his chest. He doesn\u2019t recognize it, but before he can snap at her, Wu Yingtai says, \u201cThe asshole tries to stand up and keep watch, what was I supposed to do? Dealing with him finally gave me sympathy for \u2013 for my own doctors.\u201d</p>\n<p>He notices her stumble over her words, but can\u2019t bring himself to care about it. He only has eyes for his brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cSizhui,\u201d Wu Yingtai says. His nephew nods and leans over to press his hands against Wangji\u2019s shoulders. She yanks off the talisman and Wangji's eyes fly open. He tries to push himself up, but Sizhui keeps him flat on his back. \u201cAh, Hanguang Jun, are you always this bad at listening? Don\u2019t move!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stills, turning his head in their direction. Wangji\u2019s eyes meet his but he passes over him to focus on her. \u201cWu Yingtai. You need to rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the person who didn\u2019t get stabbed, I don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d she says. She steps away from Jin Ling to sit next to him on the bed and Sizhui lets go of Wangji. She flattens her hands against the bandages across Lan Zhan\u2019s stomach, carefully watching his face. He only raises an eyebrow at her and she hums before picking up his wrist, pressing her fingers against his pulse. Lan Xichen can\u2019t quite believe Wangji is letting this happen, is letting her touch him like this and not even flinching away from it. She sighs, adjusting her grip so she\u2019s holding his wrist but not letting go of it and Wangji doesn\u2019t try and make her. \u201cAh, Hanguang Jun, your golden core is so strong! You\u2019ll probably be alright to fly home in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks to you,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai flushes and Lan Xichen feels his heart sink. This can\u2019t be happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of that! You saved me first, after all, even if it was a really dumb thing to do.\u201d She gently puts Wangji\u2019s hand on his chest, giving his wrist a light squeeze before pushing herself to her feet.</p>\n<p>She sways and both Wangji and Sizhui reach out to steady her, but Jin Ling wraps an arm around her waist and glares at them. \u201cCome on, Aunt Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Does that glare seem worse than before? More possessive? Does Jin Ling know that Wangji is in love with his uncle\u2019s fianc\u00e9? Lan Xichen can\u2019t tell.</p>\n<p>He waits for the door to shut behind them to reach out and grasp his brother\u2019s shoulder, his tongue thick in his mouth as he tries to think of what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Wangji says, reaching up to cover his hand with his own. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>His breath leaves him in a rush, the fear and adrenaline of the past twelve hours leaving him exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever it is that needs to be said doesn\u2019t need to be said tonight. For tonight he can sit with his brother and his nephew and just be grateful that he didn\u2019t lose either of them.</p>\n<p>That he has Wu Yingtai to thank for that is too complicated of a feeling for tonight, so he sets it aside until morning.</p>\n<p>If only she weren\u2019t engaged to Jiang Wanyin.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t want to leave.</p>\n<p>The Lans are escorting the Ouyang disciples home, just in case, but Wu Yingtai and Jin Ling aren\u2019t coming with them, and it\u2019s not <em>fair</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait until Sect Leader Jiang gets here?\u201d he asks as they\u2019re all gathered in front of the inn. They\u2019re supposed to be saying goodbye but he \u2013 it just seems wrong, is all. Wu Yingtai looks better after getting a couple hours of sleep and changing into clean robes, but surely that\u2019s not enough to recover from all she\u2019d done? What if the masked man comes back and she has to face him alone?</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai laughs and reaches out to smooth the line between his eyebrows. He sees his uncle startle out of the corner of his eye but can\u2019t bring himself to be embarrassed. He wants to lean into her touch and has to hide the harsh sting of disappointment when she pulls her hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so much, Sizhui. Yunmeng is further away than Gusu, he\u2019ll be here soon, and Hanguang Jun needs to see an actual healer.\u201d</p>\n<p>His father is frowning and Jingyi is practically vibrating. Ouyang Zizhen wrings his hands together as he asks, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling okay? You used a lot of blood.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>At least he\u2019s not the only one worried about her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>fine</em>,\u201d she insists. \u201cGo on, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you again. You\u2019ll be attending the cultivation conference in Lanling next month with your father, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says glumly before he brightens. \u201cOh, will you be there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Ling crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cOf course she\u2019ll be there. What kind of question is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t normally attend the cultivation conferences. He wonders if his father will mind if he goes to this one.</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes and then bows to them, kicking Jin Ling in the shin until he does the same. \u201cThank you, all of you. We wouldn\u2019t have made it out with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They bow in return, A-die deeper than their positions demand, but she had saved his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it out without you!\u201d Jingyi protests.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s laughing as she straightens. \u201cWe saved each other, how about that? I think it makes us even.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die hums then says, \u201cThank you, Wu Yingtai.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I just say, Hanguang Jun?\u201d she demands, putting her hands on her hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d he corrects, his eyes warmer than Sizhui can remember them being in, well, maybe ever. He doesn\u2019t think his father has ever requested someone be <em>less </em>formal with him before.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai\u2019s mouth hangs open for a moment before she\u2019s giving him a blazing grin, one that puts all her former smiles to shame. \u201cAlright, Lan Wangji. If you insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really be okay?\u201d he asks and doesn\u2019t realize how tight his voice sounds until everyone\u2019s turning to look at him. \u201cI just \u2013 it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re,\u201d he pauses, face burning. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her grin softens and she steps forward. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s being pulled into a hug until her arms are around him and his face is pressed into her shoulder. He clings to her, probably too tightly, but she doesn\u2019t pull away, only holds him all the tighter. \u201cSuch a sweet boy! Of course you\u2019ll see me again, stop worrying. I can take care of myself, all right? Take care of Lan Wangji for me until then, clearly he can\u2019t do it himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>His laugh is too watery, but she doesn\u2019t call him on it, just pinches his cheek when he steps back. It should irritate him, being treated like a little kid, but instead it just makes him smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Jin Ling shouts and then they\u2019re all looking up to the sky.</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang descends on his sword, glower clearly visible.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai tenses, reaching into her sleeve, but then he lands, Zidian sparking up his arm in irritation, and he shouts, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? What the fuck kind of message was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>She relaxes again and says, \u201cOh good, it\u2019s you. Unless they killed you and stole your face and managed to convince Zidian to listen to a new master, but that last part seems really unlikely.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face scrunches. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d He grabs Jin Ling and yanks him over to his side, shaking him. \u201cDid you do something stupid? Are you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Ling sighs, not even resisting the manhandling. He reminds Sizhui of a kitten being picked up by the scruff of its neck by its mother. \u201cNo, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai is laughing as she walks over to them, putting her hand on Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s arm. \u201cA-Cheng, come on, he did a great job! I\u2019ll tell you all about it on our way to Yi City.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are we going to Yi City?\u201d he demands, frowning. \u201cWhat about you, are you hurt?\u201d He lets go of Jin Ling to tilt Wu Yingtai\u2019s face back. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says dryly before smirking. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but I nearly got my head cut off. Luckily Lan Wangji was there to save me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji, huh?\u201d he mutters darkly. Sizhui sees his uncle flinch and he can\u2019t think of why. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s intimidated by Sect Leader Jiang, even when he\u2019s angry.</p>\n<p>She nods very seriously. \u201cHe saved my <em>life</em>, A-Cheng.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang presses his lips together then turns to A-die and bows. \u201cThank you for protecting A-Ying, Hanguang Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>His father blinks then inclines his head.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai cackles, hanging off Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s arm and elbowing him in the side. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it! So diplomatic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it back, he should have let you die,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s not looking at them anymore, instead frowning down at her in a way that doesn\u2019t really look angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late!\u201d She waves at them. \u201cBye Lans and Ouyangs! Don\u2019t get into any more trouble without me!\u201d She winks at them the grabs Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s hand, trying and failing to drag him down the street. \u201cA-Cheng, let\u2019s go! Weird stuff was happening and I want to figure it out, come on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang doesn\u2019t budge an inch for a moment before sighing and shaking Wu Yingtai off, although he does start walking down the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was really weird,\u201d Jin Ling says, nudging himself forward so he\u2019s walking between her and Sect Leader Jiang.</p>\n<p>Sizhui turns around to step onto his sword, trying to convince himself that the feeling in his chest isn\u2019t jealousy.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t do a very good job of it.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re nearly at Jin Tower and Lan Wangji knows his brother is going say something before he opens his mouth. He\u2019s been sending him sidelong glances the whole way to Lanling, so it\u2019s hardly been subtle, and Sizhui and Jingyi have dropped back far enough that they shouldn\u2019t be able to overhear them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d he starts.</p>\n<p>He waits, but Xichen says nothing further. \u201cBrother,\u201d he sighs, \u201cit\u2019s fine. I am used to wanting what I cannot have.\u201d</p>\n<p>The skin around his brother\u2019s eyes tightens and Xichen reaches out to grasp his forearm, a quick touch that Lan Wangji barely has the time to feel before it\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying was never his to begin with, even if he\u2019d thought that maybe they could belong to one another one day, it hadn\u2019t mattered. He\u2019d died. Lan Wangji had wanted and not had Wei Ying since he was fifteen, longing and grief and regret making themselves a home in his chest.</p>\n<p>This is familiar, but simpler too. He will always love Wei Ying. He will never move on from the love of his life. The idea is preposterous.</p>\n<p>However. Wu Yingtai has a shrieking laugh and clever eyes and he thinks that he could love her too, given the chance. He thinks that perhaps he already does, that perhaps he fell for her like he fell for Wei Ying. Instantaneously, the moment she smiled at him in the middle of Cloud Recesses, too close and not close enough. \u00a0</p>\n<p>She is not his to love, like just Wei Ying wasn\u2019t his to love. But this ache is sweeter. He may feel how he feels about Jiang Wanyin, but he clearly loves Wu Yingtai, just as clearly as she loves him. Getting to watch her live a full and happy life with another man will not hurt him the way Xichen is worried about.</p>\n<p>It will be a privilege.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d give anything for Wei Ying to still be alive, to be able to see him happy and in love, even if it wasn\u2019t with him. The idea of Wei Ying alive in the world is aching and sharp against his sternum. To have attended his wedding, to be able to meet his children, to sit across from him at a cultivation conference and see his smile \u2013 it would mean everything to him, to have that with Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>How can he feel any less for Wu Yingtai? He will live off her happiness with Jiang Wanyin as if he\u2019s surviving of inedia, making a grand meal out of nothing he can consume, and it will be enough.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng cannot <em>believe</em> he let himself get talked into this. Wei Wuxian would have been one thing, but even Jin Ling had begged him to help. He could deny one of them but both was a trial even for him. Not that Jin Ling had stuck around to deal with the consequences. He\u2019s going to have to have a conversation with Jin Guangyao about absconding with their nephew when Jiang Cheng is trying to teach him a lesson.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s making good progress,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells Song Lan as he\u2019s crouched over Xiao Xingchen\u2019s corpse, which is currently covered in specialized lure talismans. \u201cHopefully by the time we get back he\u2019ll be finished gathering, but I really don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t guarantee anything. I\u2019m kind of making this up as I go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Song Lan says quietly with his newly repaired tongue courtesy of Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019s enough that you\u2019re trying. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing that Jiang Cheng has a thirteen year long history of not allowing anyone in Wei Wuxian\u2019s room. A-Qing had been hard enough to explain to everyone and she\u2019s actually alive. Song Lan at least seems <em>mostly</em> alive.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen, on the other hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean making it up?\u201d Jiang Cheng grumbles. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls a face. \u201cNo, how many times do I have to tell you? Wen Ning wasn\u2019t actually dead, just <em>mostly</em> dead. All I had to do was make his body something that could hold onto his soul. This is the <em>opposite</em> and much harder.\u201d Skepticism is a strange look on his brother\u2019s face and Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t like it. \u201cXue Yang, the absolute creep, has done a very good job of repairing and preserving Xiao Xingchen\u2019s body, but now I\u2019ve got to try and lure the remainder his spiritual cognition into one place and then get it to stick to his body. Honestly, it\u2019s closer to proper necromancy than anything else I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea that everything else his brother has done somehow doesn\u2019t count as proper necromancy really doesn\u2019t do anything to comfort him. \u201cGreat. Come on, can we go now? We can\u2019t be late and we\u2019re going to be if we don\u2019t leave <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan\u2019s lips almost twitch into a smile before settling back into a smooth line. Jiang Cheng wishes he could blame it on a lack of fine motor control with his partially dead body, but he knows that his inability to smile is directly linked to Xiao Xingchen. Although he had made a passable attempt at it when faced with A-Qing, the girl who tried to save Xiao Xingchen, who tried to save the juniors in Yi City.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right, yes, we can go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, drawing a couple more talismans in the air before giving a satisfied nod and clapping Song Lan on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re almost to the dock where the rest of the disciples are gathered when Jiang Cheng reaches out and grabs Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist. \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brother stops, frowning as he turns to face him. \u201cA-Cheng?\u201d</p>\n<p>He almost doesn\u2019t do it, because he knows his brother well enough that this will hurt at least as much as it helps, but he\u2019s not sure what else to do. \u201cWe\u2019re walking into a situation where we don\u2019t have all the information.\u201d Nie Mingjue\u2019s headless body and Xue Yang and a ghost sword and Wei Wuxian\u2019s resurrection are all connected and have to make some sort of sense, but they haven\u2019t been able to figure out how or why. The only thing they\u2019re sure of is someone is playing with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll protect you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, only half mocking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what he\u2019s afraid of.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour golden core isn\u2019t strong enough to use a sword, everyone will know who you are soon as you use Chenqing, and your daggers don\u2019t do you much good until someone is too close to you,\u201d he says. \u201cWhoever is behind all this will probably be there. No one who isn\u2019t part of the world of cultivation politics would even know enough to orchestrate this, never mind do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, soft and not even a little mocking, \u201cit\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows. He doesn\u2019t have to do this. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s planning to let Wei Wuxian go running off into danger on his own anyway. He could accept his brother\u2019s word and not push.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t pushed before and by the time he\u2019d tried to hold onto his brother he was already out of reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he says. Wei Wuxian raises an eyebrow but holds out his hand. Jiang Cheng grabs his wrist with one hand and presses their palms together with the other.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flinches and tries to pull back, but Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t let him. Zidian comes to life, slithering from his hand to wrap around Wei Wuxian\u2019s. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want \u2013 you can\u2019t! Your mother wouldn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother is dead,\u201d he says bluntly, ignoring the sharp ache with years of long practice. \u201cI\u2019ve been Zidian\u2019s master for over fifteen years and I want you as safe as I can make you. You can give it back to me after we leave.\u201d Zidian is curled around Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and Jiang Cheng lets go, moving his hands to press against his brother\u2019s back, where the scars from his mother\u2019s whipping had been in his previous body. \u201cZidian hasn\u2019t been Madame Yu\u2019s spiritual tool in a long time. It\u2019s mine. It won\u2019t hurt you. It will obey you. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks down at Zidian for a long moment then swallows before looking up at him. His eyes are bright and Jiang Cheng resists the urge to look away, to let his temper snap just so he has a reason to change the subject. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d He scowls. \u201cWho else? You and Jin Ling are all the family I have. Zidian wouldn\u2019t betray me by letting either of you come to harm. You\u2019ll be able to wield it as easily as our nephew can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Wuxian looks down at Zidian, flexing his hand, then he beams as throws himself forward, clinging to him and shouting, \u201cOh, A-Cheng, you do care!\u201d</p>\n<p>The trade off for having his brother back is, unfortunately, having to deal with him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen is bowing to Jin Guangyao when Jingyi hisses, \u201cLook, look, there she is!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji stiffens but doesn\u2019t turn around. Jin Guangyao tilts his head to the side and Lan Xichen huffs a laugh. \u201cWu Yingtai,\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>His face clears, the skin around his temples twitching like he\u2019d roll his eyes if they were alone. \u201cOh, good, I\u2019ll finally get to meet her. A-Ling is quite taken with her as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Lans!\u201d a familiar voice calls out excitedly and Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t bother to hide his smile. \u201cLan Wangji, Lan Wangji, are you ignoring me? What shameful behavior from the notorious Hanguang Jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen turns, which means the rest of them are able to as well. Wu Yingtai is wearing new purple silk robes embroidered with silver lotuses, her hair in its customary style of mostly loose around her as she waves at them. There is, however, a silver ornament in her hair that Lan Xichen vaguely remembers Jiang Yanli wearing during her stay in Cloud Recesses. Jiang Wanyin sighs deeply, shooting her an irritated glance, but the retinue of Jiang disciples behind them are biting their cheeks to keep from laughing.</p>\n<p>They finish the climb up the steps, and Wu Yingtai is pink cheeked but not winded, and its such a contrast to the way she\u2019d struggled to climb the steps to Cloud Recesses just a few months ago. Whatever her health problems may have been, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re improving. She\u2019s not as frighteningly skinny as she used to be either.</p>\n<p>Sizhui is the one to break away, which Lan Xichen hadn\u2019t been expecting. He crosses the space between them but freezes when he gets in front of them, like he hadn\u2019t even realized he was moving in the first place. Jiang Wanyin raises an eyebrow but Wu Yingtai laughs, easily folding Sizhui into her arms. \u201cMy sweet boy coming to greet me properly! Making up for your father\u2019s poor manners, I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWu Yingtai,\u201d Sizhui says, embarrassment turning his ears red, but he doesn\u2019t pull away from her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here! Even if it\u2019s all going to be frightfully dull, I\u2019m afraid, these things always are. You\u2019ll have to keep my company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui pulls back to look at her face and whatever he finds there causes him to beam. \u201cI would love to.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles and curls an arm around his shoulders, steering him back over to them. Jingyi is shifting his weight in a way that\u2019s not quite bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cWu Yingtai! You\u2019re here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she says agreeably, but her smile is warm. It warms even further when her eyes land on his brother. \u201cLan Wangji, are you ignoring me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d he asks, perfectly polite, nothing in his voice or face to show he\u2019s being anything but completely sincere.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai scowls and points at him. \u201cLan Wangji, are you saying I\u2019m loud? That I\u2019m improper? That I lack decorum?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not say that,\u201d he says. His voice doesn\u2019t fluctuate at all. It doesn\u2019t dip into something more familiar or raise into a mocking tone.</p>\n<p>She laughs at him, eyes sparkling. \u201cI\u2019m going to remember that, Lan Wangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says. He sounds exasperated, but not angry. Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t understand. Even if he can\u2019t tell that Wangji is flirting with Wu Yingtai, surely he can tell that she\u2019s flirting with Wangji, and yet he doesn\u2019t shout or yank her away. He\u2019s glaring, but that\u2019s a rather mild reaction from him, all things considered, and hardly means anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right, right, sorry!\u201d She squeezes Sizhui\u2019s shoulder and then lets go to walk with Jiang Wanyin to stand in front of Jin Guangyao. Wu Yingtai bows just seconds behind Jiang Wanyin, so close together that he can\u2019t be certain that it was even on purpose. Maybe she meant to bow at the same time as him, even. The Jiang disciples wait a beat before following suit, mirroring their sect leader and Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>\u201cSect Leader Jin,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says formally, \u201cthank you for the invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an uncharacteristic moment of silence, then Jin Guangyao says, \u201cAh, yes, I \u2013 yes, of course. Be welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an odd, strangled note to Jin Guangyao\u2019s voice that Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s heard before, even during the war, and he looks at him in alarm. He\u2019s too pale, staring at Wu Yingtai with wide eyes. Lan Xichen follows his gaze to her face, and doesn\u2019t see anything remarkable, but then his gaze dips a little lower to her outstretched hands and he sees what Jin Guangyao must have.</p>\n<p>The motion of bowing has pulled her sleeves up past her wrists. On her right hand is Zidian.</p>\n<p>He stares, for a moment so surprised he can do nothing else. Jiang Wanyin has made no official announcement, but perhaps he feels as if he doesn\u2019t need to. At this point, it would only be insulting. How could anyone look at Wu Yingtai and doubt her position?</p>\n<p>She\u2019s wearing new robes of silk with the Jiang colors and symbol, she has Jiang Yanli\u2019s ornament in her hair, and she has Jiang Wanyin\u2019s spiritual tool on her wrist. Jin Ling has been the only other person to wield it since Yu Ziyuan\u2019s death, except now it\u2019s on Wu Yingtai\u2019s hand. Zidian is a first class spiritual took, not a piece of jewelry. While Lan Xichen would not hesitate to hand over Liebing to Wangji if he had need of it, it\u2019s not something he would do casually. If it had belonged to his mother, he\u2019d be even more reluctant to let others handle it.</p>\n<p>Yet there Zidian is, on Wu Yingtai\u2019s hand as if it\u2019s always been there, as if it means nothing at all, when of course it means everything.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen supposes it won\u2019t be long until they\u2019re referring to Wu Yingtai as Madame Jiang.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says after a moment, looking at Jin Guangyao strangely. The Jiang head inside. Jingyi and Sizhui take a step after them, intending to follow, before they remember that they can\u2019t enter the main hall until after he and Wangji do.</p>\n<p>He looks towards his brother, but he remains as serene as ever. Whatever his feelings he may be having about Wu Yingtai wearing Jiang Wanyin\u2019s spiritual tool, he\u2019s pushing them down enough that even Lan Xichen can\u2019t read them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was weird, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters, walking close enough to Jiang Cheng that their sleeves brush against each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, shut up,\u201d he says automatically before scowling and admitting, \u201cA little bit, yeah. But it\u2019s impossible for him to know it\u2019s you, and if he\u2019d recognized you as Mo Xuanyu, he would have done something more than look a little surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s true enough. \u201cMaybe he was caught off guard by my beauty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s married to someone much prettier than you,\u201d Jiang Cheng retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrettier than <em>me?</em>\u201d he demands, laying a hand across his chest. \u201cImpossible!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes, but anything he has to say to that off is cut off by his favorite nephew yelling, \u201cAunt Ying!\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins as he turns, arms already open to catch his nephew against his chest. \u201cA-Ling! Have you been good? Did anything interesting happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says and doesn\u2019t clarify which question he\u2019s answering. He lowers his voice to ask, \u201cIs everything okay back home?\u201d</p>\n<p>It warms him that Jin Ling calls Lotus Pier home even though he\u2019s the Jin sect heir. \u201cAs well as can be expected, although no real change yet,\u201d he says, knowing that he\u2019s really asking after Xiao Xingchen.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling pulls a face but just nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ling, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turns to see a beautiful woman in golden robes so elaborate that she has to be the sect leader\u2019s wife. \u201cAunt Su,\u201d Jin Ling says, \u201cthis is Aunt Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face clears and she inclines her head. \u201cAh, the infamous Wu Yingtai. I\u2019ve heard so much about you from my nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all lies,\u201d Wei Wuxian says confidently.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng pinches the bridge of his nose while Jin Ling sighs.\u00a0 \u201cA-Ying. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSect Leader Jiang,\u201d Qin Su says formally, which is <em>weird</em> because they share a nephew. Then again Jiang Cheng\u2019s\u2026 everything doesn\u2019t really invite closeness. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you attending these conferences with someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sounds sincere, but Jiang Cheng\u2019s face clouds over anyway. \u201cWell, you better get used to it,\u201d he snaps, \u201cA-Ying isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian starts, sighing, but Jiang Cheng just glares at her before going off to harass someone on the other side of the hall, dragging a sighing Jin Ling along with him. He <em>isn\u2019t </em>going anywhere, and he\u2019s hardly going to give up his chance to help lead the Jiang like he\u2019d wanted to and couldn\u2019t in his previous life, but no one outside of the clan is going to understand that little temper tantrum. He turns back to Qin Su and offers her a shallow bow, \u201cPlease, excuse us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, and instead of being offended there\u2019s a fond smile in the corner of her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see he\u2019s found someone like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh no, she thinks that \u2013 well, fuck. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Qin Su gives her a tolerant, sisterly glance that makes Wei Wuxian want to die. \u201cI understand. It wasn\u2019t like that between A-Yao and I either. I\u2019d love to introduce you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not,\u201d he starts, and really doesn\u2019t know where to go from there without mentioning that Jiang Cheng is his brother, so he changes tracks and says, \u201cThank you, that\u2019s really nice of you, but I actually already promised my company to someone else.\u201d He looks around the room and luckily Sizhui is already staring at him, a look on his face that Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t understand and doesn\u2019t have the time to categorize.</p>\n<p>He waves him over and Sizhui appears with gratifying quickness, Jingyi hot on his heels. \u201cWu Yingtai?\u201d Sizhui asks, stepping so close to him that Wei Wuxian has to lean back to get enough space between them to take his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promised we\u2019d keep each other company,\u201d he says to Qin Su.</p>\n<p>She appears perplexed, but her smile remains entirely genuine. \u201cOf course. We\u2019ll speak later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d he says, which is a complete lie, although he keeps his fake smile in place until her back\u2019s turned.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a miracle that anyone makes it through these in one piece, either physically or emotionally.</p>\n<p>He uses the hand that\u2019s not holding on to Sizhui to reach out and tug on Jingyi\u2019s hair. \u201cHow\u2019d you get roped into attending? Usually only the senior disciples are forced to attend this crap, unless Zewu Jun is getting creative with his punishments.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI volunteered,\u201d he says, ducking away from her hands. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be rubbing elbows with the sect leaders with Sect Leader Jiang?\u201d</p>\n<p>His shudder isn\u2019t exaggerated in the slightest. \u201cA-Cheng is fine. I\u2019ll interfere if he draws Sandu, otherwise he\u2019s on his own. Why don\u2019t you introduce me to everyone here who isn\u2019t the worst? Ouyang Zizhen is supposed to around here somewhere, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui smiles up at him, so sweet and warm that he has to resist the strange urge to pinch his cheeks.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps half his attention on Wu Yingtai without really meaning to. He sees Qin Su approach her and is far from surprised. The three major sect leaders have remained unmarried for over a decade, so she\u2019s probably eager to make friends with the future wife of a sect leader, especially when that sect leader is Jiang Wanyin. The Jin and the Jiang are close allies less because they genuinely like or respect each other but because of Jin Ling. Qin Su likely sees it as her and Wu Yingtai\u2019s duty to deepen that connection and foresees Wu Yingtai being the same kind of wife to Jiang Wanyin that she is to Jin Guangyao.</p>\n<p>He doubts that\u2019s going to come to pass.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai avoids everyone of import the whole night, instead spending most of her time with the juniors except for the few times that Jiang Wanyin looks genuinely furious, and then she slips away just long enough to say something foolish and ridiculous, shifting everyone\u2019s attention off of Jiang Wanyin and onto her. They\u2019re horrified but Jiang Wanyin\u2019s scowl softens to something that Lan Wangji thinks might count as fond.</p>\n<p>He notices Nie Huaisang\u2019s eyes on her for most of the night, an uncharacteristic intensity to his gaze as he glances at her over his fan, and Lan Wangji can\u2019t help the curl of amusement in his chest. Possibly he\u2019s just curious about Jiang Wanyin\u2019s fianc\u00e9, since they used to be friends. Possibly he finds Wu Yingtai just as compelling as Lan Wangji does.</p>\n<p>The night is coming to a close by the time he finds himself across from her once more. He and Xichen are discussing the schedule for tomorrow, the official start of the conference, when a laughing Wu Yingtai is dragged over to them by a delighted Jingyi and mortified Jin Ling. Sizhui\u2019s mouth is pressed together in a tight line, an expression that Lan Wangji recognizes from his own face. He\u2019s trying to appear angry but he\u2019s just amused. Ouyang Zizhen is holding his head in his hands and it\u2019s actually a fairly impressive to display of cultivation that he\u2019s able to navigate around the hall with his eyes covered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying is in time out,\u201d Jin Ling declares, his face red. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they\u2019re going to ask rude questions, then they\u2019re going to get rude answers,\u201d she says carelessly. Her smile is bright and unrepentant and at once reminds him of Wei Ying and is still entirely herself that he feels as if his heart is being carved out of his chest. He still has to push down the urge to smile back at her. \u201cZewu Jun, Lan Wangji, it seems as if you have no choice but to entertain me, as I\u2019m currently being held hostage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a terrible situation you\u2019ve found yourself in,\u201d Xichen says gravely, his lips curled up in the corners.</p>\n<p>\u201cZizhen!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang shouts, making a spectacle of himself as he stomps his way over to them, grabbing everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cStop bothering everyone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ouyang Zizhen drops his hands and hides behind Wu Yingtai, who just rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not,\u201d Wu Yingtai says. \u201cWe met at that night hunt in Yi City, I\u2019m sure you heard about it? You must be so proud of him, your son is very impressive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is pretty sure that mostly what Ouyang Zizhen did was follow Wu Yingtai\u2019s directions without screaming, but considering how many of the juniors hadn\u2019t managed to do that, perhaps it is an impressive feat.</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin is staring at them from across the room, a scowl that almost looks concerned on his face. He abandons his conversation to head their way, which is unfortunate and confusing. Sect Leader Ouyang is hardly a threat to Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Wu,\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang gruffly, inclining his head. \u201cThank you for your assistance on that night hunt. I\u2019m told I would be down a son and several disciples if you hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d</p>\n<p>She waves a hand dismissively, as if she\u2019d hardly done anything at all. \u201cOh, I really didn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo it for praise,\u201d Jiang Wanyin interrupts as he stops at her side, standing closer to her than he has anyone else all night. \u201cA-Ying was of course fulfilling her duty as a senior disciple of the Jiang.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. Jiang Wanyin wants to ensure that her graciousness doesn\u2019t give Sect Leader Ouyang the impression that the Jiang aren\u2019t keeping score, because Jiang Wanyin very much is.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenior disciple,\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang repeats, his gaze briefly dipping to down to where Zidian is on Wu Yingtai\u2019s hand. \u201cRight. Well, clearly you\u2019re good with children, if even my dishonorable son will listen to you. You\u2019ll make a good mother to your own gaggle of kids. I can barely handle the one!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sees Wu Yingtai blush properly for the first time since he\u2019s known her and he thinks he forgets to breathe. Her voice is wistful when she says, \u201cDo you really think so? Three\u2019s a good number, I think, so at least that many. A-Ling could use some cousins.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin rolls his eyes, but there\u2019s something soft and fond in his face. Their children will be a force of nature, he thinks, with Jiang Wanyin\u2019s temper and Wu Yingtai\u2019s fearlessness.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what do you think of that, Sect Leader Jiang?\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang asks, a teasing lilt to his voice. \u201cHow many do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin blinks, genuinely taken aback. \u201cWhat? None. Jin Ling was enough for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, awkward beat of silence, while they all stare at him and Jin Ling slowly turns red. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t understand. Jiang Wanyin needs heirs, and his fianc\u00e9 clearly wants to have children, why would he put his clan at risk like that? Why would he deny her?</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t quite help the curl of resentment. Wu Yingtai wants to have children with him. Why wouldn\u2019t he want such a thing?</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Wanyin!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang shouts. \u201cHow can you treat your fianc\u00e9 so cruelly?\u201d Lan Wangji can\u2019t believe he\u2019s being forced to agree with Sect Leader Ouyang. \u201cLady Wu will surely leave you if you refuse to give her children!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai immediately covers her face with her hands, Jiang Wanyin turns an unhealthy shade of grey, and Jin Ling scrunches up his nose and says, \u201cGross.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin takes a deep breath. \u201cYou \u2013 how dare you \u2013 why would you\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t neglect your marital duties!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang says authoritatively. \u201cMy wife becomes quite cross if I\u2019m neglectful! It\u2019s an important aspect of a healthy marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ouyang Zizhen makes a strangled sound then echoes Jin Ling, \u201c<em>Gross</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI AM NOT ENGAGED TO A-YING!\u201d Jiang Cheng roars, facing rapidly going from grey to red. \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO MARITAL DUTIES!\u201d He reaches for his sword, seemingly barely restraining himself from unsheathing it. The rest of the hall has gone quiet, everyone\u2019s attention on them.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai\u2019s shoulders are shaking, her face still covered. Is she crying? Has Jiang Wanyin\u2019s denial of their relationship moved her to tears?</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Sect Leader Jiang, just because you haven\u2019t made a formal announcement doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us can\u2019t tell,\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang chides. \u201cYou\u2019re both so obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not nor will I ever be engaged to Wu Yingtai!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting! Spew any more filth and I\u2019ll cut out your tongue!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai lifts her head, and there are tears down her cheeks, which makes Lan Wangji cold, but then he sees that there\u2019s also a grin stretching across her face.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s laughing. She\u2019s laughing so hard she\u2019s crying, only able to stay upright because of the grip an alarmed Sizhui has on her elbow. \u201cA-Cheng,\u201d she gasps, \u201cdon\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t you want to make and h-honest woman out of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he says furiously. \u201cAs if anyone could! Who would want to marry you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sees Xichen turn to him out of the corner of his eye and for the first time in his life considers the merits of fratricide. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai is still having trouble getting her words out between her giggles, but she turns to Sect Leader Ouyang and says, \u201cA-Cheng and I are dear friends, but we\u2019re not involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d he blinks. \u201cYou \u2013 you sit on the Lotus Throne. You wear his sister\u2019s clothes and jewelry. You lead the disciples. You\u2019re carrying Zidian. You are more than a dear friend. How do you explain that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my <em>heir</em>,\u201d Jiang Wanyin snaps, still so appalled at all of this, although now he\u2019s edged past being flushed with embarrassment to being green around the edges. It can\u2019t be healthy for him to turn so many different colors so quickly.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai startles. \u201cI am?\u201d</p>\n<p>A Jiang disciple slaps a hand over her face in the crowd while several more let out exasperated sighs. Lan Wangji might be able to find humor in that at another time, but for now he\u2019s barely able to process it, still so focused on what\u2019s happening in front of them. It can\u2019t be. She and Jiang Wanyin are engaged. Everyone knows. They\u2019re so obvious with each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else would you be?\u201d he asks, something about him a challenge and a warning, which Lang Wangji doesn\u2019t understand at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d she says, \u201cright, good point. I guess I didn\u2019t really think about it? But there you go, I\u2019m A-Cheng\u2019s heir, not his fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin makes a retching noise and says, \u201cI refuse to discuss this anymore,\u201d before turning on his heel and walking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle, wait,\u201d Jin Ling calls out plaintively, scurrying after him. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me with them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ling!\u201d Wu Yingtai shouts, but he doesn\u2019t even glance back at her, and it sets her off on a new round of giggles.</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Ouyang throws her look that\u2019s faintly alarmed and bows at all of them before dragging his son away in the opposite direction that Jiang Wanyin and Jin Ling had gone.</p>\n<p>When she settles, she has an arm around Sizhui\u2019s shoulders, her hair ribbon having come loose in the commotion so it\u2019s all a wavy mess. \u201cThat was fantastic. Did you see his face?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t make his own face work properly, all of it too numb to force a smile or proper words to come out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re truly not engaged to Sect Leader Jiang?\u201d Xichen asks. Lan Wangji refuses to turn to see his brother\u2019s expression.</p>\n<p>She blinks, genuinely taken aback. \u201cZewu Jun! I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d heard those rumors. Doesn\u2019t your clan have a rule against gossiping?\u201d Her lips thin as she presses them together and Lan Wangji would be alarmed if he couldn\u2019t tell she was doing it to suppress her laughter. \u201cDid you think we were engaged when we were at Cloud Recesses? We spent so much time alone together! Didn\u2019t you think it was terribly scandalous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my place to judge,\u201d Xichen says diplomatically, which of course means yes, he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a gentleman,\u201d she says, still teasing. \u201cA-Cheng is very dear to me, but no, we\u2019re not engaged. Nor am I engaged to anyone else! Rumors are such nasty things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to be?\u201d Sizhui asks, looking up at her with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>Betrayed by his own son. He\u2019s finally starting to get the appeal of entering seclusion.</p>\n<p>She tilts her head to the side, considering. \u201cI never really thought about it, I suppose. I wasn\u2019t just messing with Sect Leader Ouyang, I do want children again, so a spouse seems like they\u2019d help with that sort of thing. But I suppose that\u2019s up to A-Cheng. Since I\u2019m his heir, my marriage is his problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Lan Wangji speaks without thinking and regrets it as soon as the words leave his lips. There\u2019s no good answer to the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain what?\u201d Wu Yingtai asks.</p>\n<p>He means to change the subject, but Jingyi says, \u201cYou said have children <em>again</em>. Are you already married? Do you have kids now? Where are they?\u201d He looks around, like kids will appear out of nowhere, coming to run and cling to her skirts.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches her face, sees the way her smile almost slips before stretching wider than it was before and how her eyes focus on something they can\u2019t see, and he knows that look. He\u2019d seen it on Wei Ying\u2019s face so many times as he hid his hurt under his smile. He hates being the reason for it on Wu Yingtai\u2019s face as much as he\u2019d hated being the reason for it on Wei Ying\u2019s. \u201cHad, I suppose. Just the one. He was nearly four when \u2013 well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Jingyi is horrified, his face scrunched up like he\u2019s about to start crying, and Wu Yingtai\u2019s soft laughter sounds entirely genuine as she reaches out to smooth the line between his eyebrows. \u201cNone of that, okay? It\u2019s in the past now. I wasn\u2019t ever married, it wasn\u2019t like that. He was just mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xichen opens his make to say something, something sympathetic and appropriate that will hopefully do something about the hollowness in the center of his chest, but Sizhui says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Wu Yingtai. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches out to pinch Sizhui\u2019s cheeks, her whole body language relaxing into something a little less fraught. \u201cYou remind me of him, you know? You\u2019re sweet, just like he was. I like to think if he\u2019d been able to grow up, he would have grown into a young man just like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui flushes even as his eyes darken, as if her grief is his own, and as usual a flood of fondness for his son fills all the empty spaces inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything,\u201d she says, and her pain has softened, replaced by a tender sort of longing. \u201cNot a single, terrible moment of any of it. Those terrible moments are far too precious to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome things,\u201d he says, and he can\u2019t stop himself from speaking for some reason, the memory of Wei Ying on a rooftop with two jars of Emperor\u2019s Smile hanging from his fist sitting beneath his tongue, \u201care worth losing if that\u2019s the price to pay for having them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai\u2019s eyebrows rise and her mouth parts before curving into a smile. Her grey eyes are warm as they look into his and for a moment he forgets he\u2019s standing in front of his brother and his son, he forgets that he\u2019s in the middle of the Jin banquet hall, and all that exists is Wu Yingtai looking at him, is her seeing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, the only person in the world in this moment, \u201cexactly.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng may not be the most observant person in the world, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s managed the past thirteen years being a sect leader by being totally oblivious. Besides, it doesn\u2019t take much to notice if he\u2019s going to be so obvious about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t have left her with them,\u201d Jin Ling says, squinting. \u201cDid you see Hanguang Jun\u2019s face while you were yelling? You know, he was acting weird with her in Yi City too. Are you going to do something about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>If even <em>Jin Ling</em> has noticed, then clearly something has to be done about it.</p>\n<p>It also means that perhaps he and Wei Wuxian have to reexamine several things that happened during the war, but that\u2019s for later tonight, when they\u2019re alone.</p>\n<p>But regardless of where or if it goes anywhere, there\u2019s something that should be made clear.</p>\n<p>He waits for Lan Xichen to be alone before coming to stand next to him, eyebrow raised. \u201cSect Leader Jiang,\u201d he greets, but there\u2019s tension around his eyes that shows he\u2019s already expecting the conversation they\u2019re about to have.</p>\n<p>\u201cSect Leader Lan,\u201d he says. He considers for half a moment approaching this tactfully but decides against it. If they wanted to be proper about this, Lan Wangji shouldn\u2019t have looked at his brother like that. \u201cWu Yingtai is a treasured member of my clan. She\u2019s going to <em>remain </em>a treasured member of my clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pretty sure the second he tells Wei Wuxian that Lan Wangji is interested in him and actually gets the idiot to <em>believe </em>it, he\u2019ll insist on coming clean. Jiang Cheng wants these boundaries made clear before that happens. He just got his brother back and he\u2019s not giving him up to Lan Wangji. Either because Lan Wangji is just terrible about expressing his feelings and <em>also</em> liked Wei Wuxian before his resurrection or because he hates him and wants him dead. He\u2019s not willing to lose his brother again, either through death or marriage.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t do him the disservice of pretending to misunderstand, at least. \u201cShe did say that her marriage would be up to your discretion.\u201d Jiang Cheng just raises an eyebrow, waiting. Lan Xichen sighs. \u201cThis is, of course, all theoretical. How would you feel about Wangji marrying into your clan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t gape but it\u2019s a near thing. This isn\u2019t really how he thought this conversation would go. He was honestly expecting them to mutually agree to allow their brothers to living in sin since neither of them would be willing to give them up. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious. He\u2019s the Second Jade of Lan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d Lan Xichen says quietly, looking right at him with a grief that Jiang Cheng hadn\u2019t expected and doesn\u2019t know what to do with. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been happy in thirteen years. I think that he could be, with her. Once I put something else before my brother\u2019s happiness and I regret it every day. I won\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThirteen years,\u201d Jiang Cheng echoes. That almost sounds like \u2013 but surely if Lan Wangji had cared <em>that much </em>he would have said something \u2013</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen\u2019s lips twist into a rueful grimace. He visibly hesitates for a moment, then says, \u201cThis is not the first time I\u2019ve contemplated the idea of Wangji joining the Jiang clan. Under different circumstances, I believe we would have had this discussion already.\u201d</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t be having the conversation that he thinks they\u2019re having. \u201cI thought Lan Wangji hated my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>He startles, then says, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve heard you refer to Wei Wuxian as your brother.\u201d Fuck. \u201cNo, of course not. Wangji never hated him. Far from it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unbelievable. Of course it would be asking too much for Lan Wangji to have ever communicated that in any sort of obvious way. Wei Wuxian may be an idiot, but he\u2019s pretty sure his brother would have noticed a love confession.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is saved from having to come up with some sort of response to this nonsense by Qin Su storming into the banquet hall, an older woman trailing behind her with her eyes lowered. \u201cJin Guangyao!\u201d she shouts, her voice pitched to fill the room even as it trembles. Everyone falls instantly silent. \u201cYou <em>knew</em> I was Jin Guangshan\u2019s daughter and you married me anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen\u2019s eyes widen. Jiang Cheng frowns and pinches the skin of his wrist. If he\u2019s in the middle of a dream right now, that would explain several things.</p>\n<p>The doors burst open. A scarred woman stumbles into the banquet hall and announces, \u201cI was there the night Sect Leader Jin killed his father!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling, please,\u201d Jin Guangyao starts, but is cut off by a dark figure bursting in through the window and heading straight for Qin Su.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s, somehow, impossibly, Wen Ning.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, reaching for Sandu. \u201cThis is a nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>By the time Lan Wangji has wrapped his hand around Bichen, Wu Yingtai has rushed to stand in front of Qin Su, once more using herself as a shield and putting herself in harms way. He gets the impression that if he plans to stick around her then this is something he\u2019s going to have learn to anticipate.</p>\n<p>He intends to get in front of her, to put a stop to Wen Ning, but Wu Yingtai pulls her arm back and Zidian sparks up her wrist then unfurls behind her. She arcs it forward, the purple crackling whip coming down in front of her and then snapping forward off of her wrist. For a moment Lan Wangji worries that she\u2019s lost control of it but then it hits Wen Ning in the center of the chest, the whip wrapping around his torso and restraining him in place.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai doesn\u2019t look away from the paralyzed Wen Ning as she gestures to a group of the Jiang disciples and orders, \u201cProtect Qin Su.\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t hesitate, two Jiang cultivators surrounding Qin Su, hands on their swords, but Lan Wangji isn\u2019t focused on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Wu Yingtai says, addressing the banquet hall as she takes confident steps forward. \u201cI\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji risks a glance around. The Jiang disciples have pushed themselves to the front, acting as a loose barrier to keep everyone back and away. He wonders if they knew to do that or if Wu Yingtai gave them some sort of signal that he missed.</p>\n<p>He slowly steps closer. Her gaze briefly flickers towards him, but she doesn\u2019t tell him to stop. Instead she\u2019s focused back on Wen Ning. He expects her to reach for her daggers, for her talismans, but instead she steps so close to Wen Ning that there\u2019s barely any distance between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d she says, low enough that her words are clearly meant for the fierce corpse she has restrained rather than all the people around her. She places one of her hands on his shoulder, using it for balance as she goes to her tip toes and carefully reaches into Wen Ning\u2019s hair. She runs her fingers across the back of his scalp, and then her hand comes to a stop and a complicated look crosses her face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve seen this before. It\u2019s okay, you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She yanks and a thick, bloody needle falls from the back of Wen Ning\u2019s head. He snarls, jerking away from her, his barred mouth coming dangerously close to her neck.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai doesn\u2019t flinch, just removes her hand from his shoulder to cup his jaw, her thumb making soothing stroking motions against his cheek. \u201cI know, I know. This sucks, huh? But its going to be okay. I\u2019m going to make it okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pulls out another large, bloody needle, almost more like a spike, but Lan Wangji barely notices it clatter to the ground. He\u2019s seen this before. Looking at her now, he\u2019s back in the Burial Mounds, Sizhui in his arms as Wei Ying performs a miracle while he\u2019s useless and his throat is closed in fear as Wei Ying shows a tenderness to a fierce corpse that Lan Wangji has never seen before or since.</p>\n<p>Until now.</p>\n<p>A third, final needle falls to the ground and Wu Yingtai pats Wen Ning\u2019s chest, saying, \u201cThere, lets give that a few hours for the effects to wear off, yeah? It\u2019ll be \u2013 uh, yeah, Lan Wangji?\u201d</p>\n<p>Once again he hadn\u2019t intended to move, but here he is, Wu Yingtai\u2019s wrist in his hand, both of them so close to Wen Ning and so far away from everyone else. She confused again, and its like being back in the Mingshi again, except this time he knows why he\u2019s holding onto her, why he can\u2019t let her go.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s <em>impossible</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he breathes, soft enough that no one else can hear him.</p>\n<p>She flinches.</p>\n<p>He tugs her forward, so she\u2019s pressed against him like that day she ran into him, and curls his other arm around her waist. He lowers his head so he can speak directly into her ear. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>She breathes out, shuddering in his arms, then mutters, \u201cLan Zhan. Not here.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns his face to bury it in Wei Ying\u2019s hair, attempting to hide his smile from everyone else.</p>\n<p>Explanations can come later. For now, Wei Ying is alive, and in his arms, and that\u2019s enough.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen takes a moment in the middle of everything happening to be grateful that he and Jiang Wanyin had discussed the situation already.</p>\n<p>His reserved, proper little brother is curled around Wu Yingtai, his face pressed into her hair. He thinks they\u2019re speaking, but he can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, can only see the possessive way Wangji\u2019s arm is pressed against Wu Yingtai\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>Wangji lifts his head and for a moment Lan Xichen is certain that Jiang Wanyin is correct and this is some kind of dream or hallucination. He\u2019s smiling. His brother is <em>smiling</em>.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai looks up at him and seems to get caught in that same smile that\u2019s stopped Lan Xichen cold. They stare at each other for a long moment, and there\u2019s some yelling between Qin Su and the newly arrived woman and Jin Guangyao, and people are turning to that since it\u2019s apparently more interesting than the neutralized fierce corpse, but Lan Xichen can\u2019t look away. Wu Yingtai\u2019s face turns \u00a0bright red and her mouth drops open. She licks her bottom lip and Wangji\u2019s eyes dip briefly to watch her mouth. Jiang Wanyin makes an outraged noise at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wu Yingtai starts, then blinks several times. She reaches out a hand, almost touching his brother\u2019s cheek, but doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d he hums, then tilts his cheek so it rests in her palm.</p>\n<p>She turns an even deeper shade of red and then shifts to hide her face in Wangji\u2019s chest, a change that his brother seems more than fine with, if the way his smile twitches at the corner of his mouth is any indication.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever seen Wangji smile quite like this. Surely it\u2019s worth losing him to the Jiang if it keeps that look on his face.</p>\n<p>Then several of the things Jin Guangyao is being accused of sink in and he snaps his head around, thrusting himself into the fray.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be true.</p>\n<p>Can it?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Jiang disciples aren\u2019t letting anyone pass, keeping up the honor guard even as people converge around Sect Leader Jin. Jingyi is tugging at his sleeve in a way that would be irritating from anyone else, but Sizhui knows how fidgety Jingyi gets when he\u2019s nervous.</p>\n<p>He walks up the nearest Jiang disciple, opening his mouth to give some sort of explanation as to why they should let him through, but he doesn\u2019t need one. She steps aside for him easily and raises an eyebrow at Jingyi but sees the way he\u2019s clutching to Sizhui\u2019s sleeve and lets them both pass.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s because they know he\u2019s Hanguang Jun\u2019s son. Maybe its because they\u2019ve seen him spend most of the night with Wu Yingtai. Whatever the reason, he\u2019s grateful for it. He knows accusations of incest and patricide should probably be the more pressing concern, but there are plenty of important, powerful people here, his uncle among them. They\u2019ll figure it out and all he wants to do is find his father and his \u2013 and find Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>He stops short in front of them, wary of the fierce corpse, but Wu Yingtai brightens when she sees him and says soothingly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to look like that! Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d She steps away from A-die, flinging out her hand so Zidian slithers from around the fierce corpse to settle back around her wrist.</p>\n<p>Jingyi takes in a loud, startled breath as if he\u2019s about to yell, but the fierce corpse doesn\u2019t move, just continues standing there with a strangely blank look on his face. He still inches halfway in front of Sizhui anyway, hand half raised in the direction of his sword even though he\u2019s clearly terrified, and sometimes Sizhui loves his best friend so much it threatens to suffocate him.</p>\n<p>He nudges his elbow into Jingyi\u2019s side and moves to stand beside him. \u201cWu Yingtai, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>She taps her bottom lip, looking toward where everyone is converged, where Qin Su and the other woman are speaking that\u2019s mingled with an awful lot of yelling. \u201cI have no idea, but I bet Nie Mingjue\u2019s head is around here somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>What.</p>\n<p>Sizhui turns to A-die, in case that makes any sort of sense to him, but he just looks to Wu Yingtai and raises an eyebrow. He remembers how he\u2019d looked before, smiling with her in his arms, and Sizhui hopes that\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t have a logical, sensible explanation, he hopes his father just did it because he wanted to and Wu Yingtai let him for the same reason. But, unfortunately, they have more important things to worry about.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we found his headless body in Yi City,\u201d she says, like that\u2019s some sort of acceptable explanation. \u201cSomeone is clearly pulling some strings with this whole mess and Nie Mingjue is involved, somehow, so I bet his missing head is around here. I think it\u2019s connected to the ghost sword too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d A-die looks at the fierce corpse. \u201cWe cannot leave him behind to go looking. He\u2019s in no state to defend himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai\u2019s eyes widen and then she\u2019s beaming, tugging on A-die\u2019s sleeve in a way that reminds him of Jingyi. \u201cOf course we can\u2019t! I could have a couple disciples look after him but I don\u2019t want him to wake up with me gone again.\u201d Another use of the word again that makes no sense, but Sizhui elbows Jingyi in the side before he can question it. \u201cI could speed up the process, maybe? Otherwise it could take a few hours. But he should be able to come back to himself at his own pace!\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die nods, but says, \u201cDo you think it will be less jarring for him for his awareness to come back slowly rather than all at once, considering?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks around at the chaos they\u2019re surrounded by and grimaces. \u201cOkay, good point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about. Awareness? Back to himself? This is a fierce corpse. They don\u2019t have any awareness! By the uneasy way Jingyi is shifting his weight next to him, he\u2019s thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai motions them away then pulls a blank slip of talisman paper from her sleeve and one of her daggers, pricking her finger to draw out a complicated design that Sizhui quickly loses the ability to follow.</p>\n<p>Then she slaps it against the fierce corpses forehead and takes a couple hasty steps back.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t hate him!</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows there\u2019s a lot going on right now, and that really shouldn\u2019t be the most important bit, but his mind keeps wandering back to it. When he\u2019d pulled back, Lan Zhan had looked happy, even though he knew who he really was, had looked happy <em>because </em>he\u2019d known who he really was!</p>\n<p>Maybe thirteen years had been long enough to mellow Lan Zhan out about some of the things Wei Wuxian had thought he\u2019d hated about him. Maybe he should have guessed that, actually. The kids use his lures. Someone had to teach them.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could possibly be more important is standing in front of him, is Wen Ning, who\u2019s as alive as he was before and not a pile of ash somewhere like he\u2019d been told. It\u2019s good, but it hurts too, an ache in his chest that he can\u2019t do anything about. Wen Ning, like Jiang Cheng, like Jin Ling, has spent the past thirteen years without him, and Wei Wuxian hates that. But there\u2019s nothing he can do about it now.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning\u2019s face spasms and his fingers spread wide. This would be easier if Wei Wuxian could take out Chenqing and guide him out of this, but he\u2019s pretty sure there\u2019s no level of Jin scandal which would keep people from noticing that.</p>\n<p>He stills and Wei Wuxian takes a half step closer, ignoring the way Lan Zhan\u2019s hand twitches in his direction even as it sends a thrill up his spine. \u201cA-Ning,\u201d he croons, just like Wen Qing used to call him, and then wonders if he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He\u2019s just gotten used to it, in this body with this identity, gotten used to being affectionate with the people he cares about.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning\u2019s head snaps towards him, eyes bright and aware even as his eyebrows push together. That awareness is enough and Wei Wuxian closes the distance between them, holding Wen Ning\u2019s hands between his own. They\u2019re cold, of course, but he doesn\u2019t let that bother him. Wen Ning\u2019s a lot taller than him now and Wei Wuxian has to tilt his head back to look at him. He stares at him for a long time, long enough that the pitch of the yelling rises and falls several times before his lips quirk up at the corners and Wen Ning says, \u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t!\u201d he laughs, the relief making him giddy. Wen Ning recognizes him, of course, always. He goes on his tip toes and gives him a hug, partly just because he wants to, but also so he can whisper into his ear, \u201cI\u2019m going by Wu Yingtai. A-Cheng and Lan Zhan know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels Wen Ning nod, a barely there motion. He steps back and doesn\u2019t have the time to be relieved before Jingyi shouts, \u201cHey! Back off! Are you her husband? Because I\u2019m pretty sure you being dead means you\u2019re not actually married anymore!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slaps a hand over his face. \u201cJingyi!\u201d Sizhui yelps.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Wen Ning hums. \u201cIs he yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Wei Wuxian a minute to realize that Wen Ning is talking to him and he drops his hand to glare at him. \u201cHey! I wasn\u2019t that bad!\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Lan Zhan and Wen Ning\u2019s pointed silences are really unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve seen Nie Mingjue\u2019s head around?\u201d he asks, trying to get them back on track. \u201cAlso, what happened to you? I thought you were dead!\u201d Both Sizhui and Jingyi raise an eyebrow at the same time. \u201cMore dead. Really dead. He knows what I mean, you two be quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>The humor drains from Wen Ning\u2019s face, some of his old anxiety making an appearance as he wrings his hands together. \u201cYing-jie,\u201d okay, clearly there\u2019s still some humor buried in there, \u201cit\u2019s Jin Guangyao and Su She.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares, then prompts, \u201cWhat about them? What did they do? Something about Qin Su being his sister and him maybe killing Jin Guangshan? Honestly, I\u2019m not too concerned about the latter, it couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy, and the former is \u2013 well, gross, but I\u2019m happy to leave figuring out what to do about that to the other clans and not get involved in it at all, for once.\u201d Of course, Jiang Cheng is going to have an opinion, and actually, shit, this is going to affect Jin Ling, so he supposes he cares a little bit.</p>\n<p>He scans the room for his nephew and find him at Jiang Cheng\u2019s side, so he turns back to Wen Ning, confident that there\u2019s no safer place he could be.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, raising a hand to his forehead. \u201cI haven\u2019t been \u2013 aware \u2013 really, while they\u2019ve been using me,\u201d they all flinch at that, \u201cbut I think maybe your talisman did something. Nothing bad!\u201d he hastens to add at whatever he sees in Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cBut I remember some of it. Maybe a lot of it? And Jin Guangyao and Su She are there are a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui looks around then says, \u201cSect Leader Su is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all startle at that, everyone looking around the room, but Sizhui is right. Su She isn\u2019t here. This is the biggest scandal since \u2013 well, since Wei Wuxian was the one causing scandals. Why would he leave? What possible reason could he have to leave?</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he\u2019s sneaking around with a head somewhere, I\u2019m going to feel so smug about this,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, pulling a stack of papermen out of his sleeve. He sets a dozen of them to life and commands, \u201cFind Su She.\u201d</p>\n<p>They flutter away and Wei Wuxian rubs his chin, considering. They have some time, probably, unless Su She is just outside the door lurking like a creep, which Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t exactly put past him.</p>\n<p>He reaches out, turning Wen Ning around and making a disproving sound. \u201cA-Ning, really, your hair is a mess.\u201d Wen Ning raises a hand like he\u2019s going to do something about it and Wei Wuxian smacks it down, reaching out to finger comb his hair into some semblance of order. What he wants to do is cling to Wen Ning a little bit and find out exactly who\u2019s responsible for hurting him these past thirteen years and then remind those people <em>exactly</em> why he\u2019d been giving the title of the Yiling Patriarch. But that is, of course, a spectacularly bad idea, so he doesn\u2019t do that, and instead contents himself with this. He pulls the ribbon out his own hair, which really isn\u2019t doing him any good anyway, and slips Shije\u2019s ornament into his sleeve. \u201cAh, A-Ning, can you, I don\u2019t know, squat or something? You\u2019re so tall!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning makes a breathy sort of sound that he thinks counts as laugh and then drops onto one knee. Wei Wuxian quickly pulls his hair in the half bun that he\u2019d favored before the Burial Mounds. He stands back up and smiles down at him. \u201cNow Ying-jie\u2019s hair is a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says dismissively. \u201cNow, once we find Su She-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts, and Wei Wuxian has no idea what he\u2019s talking about until he steps behind him and gathers his hair in his hands. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t leave it loose like this. It\u2019s not proper.\u201d</p>\n<p>He means to make a joke about how he barely keeps it up as is and he\u2019s not exactly known for being proper, but the words die in his throat. Lan Zhan is warm and close and knows exactly who he is but is here anyway. He pulls his hair up into a high tail, just like he wore during his first life, and Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers scrape against his scalp as he smooths it out. Jingyi chokes and Sizhui says, voice higher than it was before, \u201cUm, A-die, are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan says calmly, tying off his hair then stepping back.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t understand their reactions until he does, until he looks at Lan Zhan and sees his bare forehead. His mouth drops open and he raises a hand to run careful fingers over the ribbon holding his hair up, his fingers brushing across the plated cloud secured right in the center.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s forehead ribbon is in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he breathes, using his familiar name without thinking. Jingyi squeaks while Sizhui\u2019s eyes light up, but he\u2019s mostly focusing on Lan Zhan, who just looks \u2013 <em>satisfied</em>, as if his name on Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips and his ribbon in his hair is all he\u2019s ever wanted.</p>\n<p>But that can\u2019t be right.</p>\n<p>Can it?</p>\n<p>He really wishes they weren\u2019t in the middle of several crises right now.</p>\n<p>One of the papermen flutter back into the room, tugging on his collar, sufficiently distracting him from everything else. For a moment. He and Lan Zhan really need to talk, or something, when this is all sorted out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good, he\u2019s found him.\u201d Wei Wuxian wants to go running out after him now, who knows what he could be doing, but he\u2019s pretty sure if he does that his brother will kill him and he\u2019ll mean it this time. He motions two of the Jiang disciples over, who peel away immediately. \u201cHere, follow this. Apprehend Su She and bring him back here, but be careful, he might be up to something. Don\u2019t do anything stupid, just wait for me if it looks dangerous. I\u2019m going to speak to A-Cheng and then I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They nod and the paperman goes sailing down the hall, leading them out of the main hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs, adopting the name Jiang Cheng calls him rather than using a name that doesn\u2019t really belong to him. He is <em>not</em> having any emotions about that. They don\u2019t have time for that right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick, and they\u2019re fine, I trained them myself,\u201d he says. It was a lifetime ago, of course, but it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cJust stay here for a second, I\u2019ll be right back and then we can go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns but nods and Wei Wuxian heads towards the center of the fray.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It happens because of an accident.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng sees Wei Wuxian pushing his way through the crowd, Lan Wangji\u2019s headband in his hair for some reason, but it\u2019s hard to keep his attention on him while Jin Guangyao become paler and more restless in the center of their circle. Qin Su is towering over him despite her small stature, incandescent in her rage, and Sisi stands at her side, less overpowering but no less righteous. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d even go so far as to say he and Jin Guangyao are friends, but they do share a nephew, and if Jin Guangyao had been distant when it came to raising Jin Ling, he\u2019d at least been there. He\u2019d let Jiang Cheng raise Jin Ling at Lotus Pier over protests that it wasn\u2019t proper for an heir to one sect to be raise in another.</p>\n<p>However, the sick feeling in his stomach is telling him that was less about what was best about Jin Ling, less about letting his mother\u2019s family have a claim to him, and more about finding a loosened relationship between Jin Ling and Lanling to be advantageous rather than something to avoid.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng wants to send Jin Ling away, he doesn\u2019t want him to have to hear all these terrible things about the man he\u2019s called uncle, but where could Jiang Cheng send him? Clearly Jin Tower isn\u2019t as safe as he thought it was and his own disciples have their hands full.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is nearly to their side when someone shouts and moves forward, jostling Wei Wuxian and shoving him into the center of the crowd. He regains his balance quickly, shooting the man who\u2019d shoved him an irritated glance.</p>\n<p>Jin Guangyao moves so quickly that Jiang Cheng barely has the time to realize what\u2019s happening and he wastes precious seconds reaching for Zidian before remembering it\u2019s currently wrapped around his brother\u2019s wrist, and he\u2019s too late. Jin Guangyao stands behind Wei Wuxian, his sword held to his throat. \u201cI know you have something to do with this,\u201d he hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Ying!\u201d Jin Ling cries out and Jiang Cheng grabs the back of his nephew\u2019s robes, yanking him back when he tries to run towards them.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is surprised for barely a moment before his expression settles into irritation. Jiang Cheng glares through his fear, ignoring the way his heart is beating too fast. His brother meets his gaze squarely, not a hint of fear there, but that\u2019s not as reassuring as he thinks it is.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has never been afraid of the things that terrified Jiang Cheng, after all.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen had believed that the situation couldn\u2019t get any worse, but its clear that it has. Jin Guangyao has his sword pressed against Wu Yintai\u2019s throat, enough that it\u2019s broken skin, if only barely. Additionally, in the ten minutes since he\u2019s left his brother\u2019s side, it appears that he\u2019s proposed, if his ribbon in Wu Yingtai\u2019s hair is any indication.</p>\n<p>Jin Guangyao is holding a sword to throat of the woman Wangji loves.</p>\n<p>He barely survived losing Wei Wuxian, and now there\u2019s no child to give his brother a will to live. He doesn\u2019t know what losing Wu Yingtai would to do Wangji. He doesn\u2019t want to find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother,\u201d Wangji says, voice low, at his side when he hadn\u2019t been a moment ago. Sizhui and Jingyi are right behind him, the terror they\u2019re failing to hide twisting his stomach into knots. Wen Ning doesn\u2019t appear to be in the room anymore, which is concerning, but he honestly doesn\u2019t have it in him to care just now.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yao, what are you doing?\u201d Qin Su demands. \u201cHaven\u2019t you caused enough trouble? Unhand Lady Wu this instant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you to command me?\u201d Jin Guangyao laughs, short and bitter. \u201cYou\u2019d be nothing without me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen flinches, but Qin Su only curls her lip back into a snarl. \u201cWithout you, I\u2019d still have been Jin Guangshan\u2019s child, apparently. Something we have in common.\u201d There\u2019s another round of disgusted muttering around them, but Lan Xichen only has eyes for the way Jin Guangyao\u2019s sword digs a little bit deeper into Wu Yingtai\u2019s skin. She still doesn\u2019t flinch.</p>\n<p>To think when he\u2019d first seen her, he\u2019d thought she was a delicate as glass. This woman is made of steel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Jin Guangyao snarls, and it takes him a moment to realize he\u2019s talking to Wu Yingtai rather than Qin Su. Wangji tenses at his side while Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face goes blank. Jin Ling goes even paler than he had been and Lan Xichen finds enough room to be confused underneath everything else he\u2019s feeling.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai rolls her eyes. \u201cDo you, Sect Leader Jin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour name isn\u2019t Wu Yingtai,\u201d he hisses. \u201cYou\u2019re Mo Xuanyu!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of perfect stillness as everyone\u2019s confusion becomes nearly a physical thing. Mo Xuanyu? Jin Guangshan\u2019s mad bastard son?</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai breaks it by throwing her head back and laughing, the sound big enough to fill the whole banquet hall. It makes the sword slide against her neck, deepening the wound, but it also cuts off the ribbon wrapped around her neck. It slides to the ground, revealing a telling bump at in the center of her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d she says, her voice low and amused somehow reminding him of when he saw her kneeling in the inn hallway surrounded by talismans, \u201cam not Mo Xuanyu.\u201d</p>\n<p>She flicks her wrist up and Zidian comes to life, wrapping around Jin Guangyao\u2019s sword, and Wu Yingtai yanks it away from her, spinning out of Jin Guangyao\u2019s grip in the same motion. Zidian curls back onto her wrist as Jin Guangyao raises his sword and she reaches into her sleeve. Maybe for her dagger, maybe for a talisman, but it\u2019s not going to be enough. Jin Guangyao isn\u2019t the best swordsman, but he doesn\u2019t have to be, not when he\u2019s so close. A dagger or talisman won\u2019t be able to stop his blade and she\u2019s going to die.</p>\n<p>Several people move at once, he and Wangji and Jiang Wanyin, but none of them get there first, none of them get there in time.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling does.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling, who excels at archery, who\u2019s always been at his best when he\u2019s had a target to hit. He hasn\u2019t moved from his place at the edge of the crowd, but his hand is outstretched and empty.</p>\n<p>His sword is sticking out of Jin Guangyao\u2019s chest, having flown through the air with the force of Jin Ling\u2019s throw and landed precisely where he\u2019d aimed it.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen raises his gaze a little higher. He sees Jin Guangyao\u2019s sword has been stopped above Wu Yingtai\u2019s head. She\u2019s holding a dizi. It\u2019s black, with red markings, a cheerful red lotus charm on the end, and it\u2019s managed to stop a cultivator\u2019s spiritual blade mid swing rather than shattering underneath it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Chenqing.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s holding Chenqing.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d said that she wasn\u2019t Mo Xuanyu. That doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s Wu Yingtai.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ling!\u201d She shoves Jin Guangyao back, not even waiting to watch him crumple to the ground. Jin Ling is pale and shaking and everyone else is frozen.</p>\n<p>She pulls Jin Ling into her arms and he goes easily, hiding his face in her shoulder and using it to muffle his sobs. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t trying \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it, I just couldn\u2019t let him hurt you, Aunt Ying I didn\u2019t mean it\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says soothingly, rubbing a hand up and down his back. \u201cIt\u2019s alright A-Ling, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re okay and I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s moved until he\u2019s already kneeling next to Jin Guangyao, his robes ruined by all the blood. He takes his friend\u2019s hand, feeling numb, because even if it\u2019s true, even it\u2019s all true, there\u2019s so many other things that have been true too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to kill him,\u201d Jin Ling sobs, so loud, the only sound in the banquet hall besides Jin Guangyao\u2019s labored breathing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! Aunt Su, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ling, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Qin Su says soothingly as she walks to her husband\u2019s side. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d Her hand wraps around the hilt of Jin Ling\u2019s sword and Jin Guangyao closes his eyes even as Lan Xichen takes in a breath to say something, to stop her, but Jin Guangyao\u2019s hand covers his and he doesn\u2019t. \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Qin Su yanks the sword out of Jin Guanyao\u2019s chest only to plunge it back into his neck.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t look at husband, at her brother, as he dies, instead looking around the room with her spine straight and sure. Lan Xichen can\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t let go of Jin Guangyao\u2019s hand even as it goes limp, even as his pulse speeds up, flutters, then disappears entirely.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is mostly focused on his crying nephew, on Jiang Cheng hovering anxiously over him, on the way Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes haven\u2019t left him during this whole mess. There\u2019s also a burning sensation on his arm that he\u2019s only felt three times before, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to push his sleeves back to check, but he\u2019s pretty sure Jin Guanyao\u2019s death has gotten rid of his last remaining curse mark.</p>\n<p>But the rest of him is focused on Qin Su. He really hadn\u2019t been expecting that.</p>\n<p>She swallows and tilts her chin up. \u201cDeath would have been the sentence for the least of his crimes. Do any disagree?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang pokes his head out through the crowd, fanning himself aggressively. \u201cWhatever you say, Sect Leader Jin!\u201d</p>\n<p>She startles for the first time, her eyebrows rising. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re entitled to the position twice over, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asks, half hiding behind his fan. \u201cAs Jin Guanyao\u2019s wife and Jin Guangshan\u2019s remaining child. Unless Jin Ling wants to claim it, of course. He\u2019ll still be the heir after Qin Su takes the position, I think? Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks down at his nephew, who shakes his head, still refusing to leave the safety of his arms. He doesn\u2019t look at Nie Huaisang, but he wants to, several things falling into place in his head. It\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d be able to prove it. But remembers how clever Nie Huaisang had been when they were kids, and how well he\u2019d hid that cleverness. <em>Someone</em> has to be pulling on all these strings.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, pulling him back to the here and now, and his relief mirrored in his brother\u2019s face. Fourteen is far too young to be clan leader, even under less traumatic circumstances, and maybe <em>technically</em> it should go to him anyway, but if Qin Su is willing to take the position, the Jiang will support it happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Wu! Lady Wu!\u201d The crowd parts, and the two disciples he\u2019d sent after Su She dart through. He\u2019s concerned up until he sees Wen Ning behind them, holding a gagged and restrained Su She in one hand and Nie Mingjue\u2019s head in the other. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>They both see Jin Guangyao\u2019s corpse at the same and turn to him with equally accusing expressions. It\u2019s completely inappropriate, but Wei Wuxian has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Ghost General!\u201d Sect Leader Yao screams, which is echoed by more people, and really, he\u2019d appreciate it if everyone could get a grip for two seconds.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, turning to him. \u201cUh, yeah? Are you just noticing that? He was here earlier!\u201d He turns back to Wen Ning, then concedes, \u201cI guess he did look more generically fierce corpse like before I combed his hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Sect Leader Yao shouts. \u201cIt can\u2019t be controlled by anyone but the Yiling Patriarch! It could kill us all!\u201d</p>\n<p>His face must be doing something, because Jiang Cheng steps forward to take their nephew into his arms, freeing Wei Wuxian to turn to Sect Leader Yao. He\u2019s still holding Chenqing and he twirls it in his hand, like he had so often during the war. \u201cFirst of all, Wen Ning is not an <em>it</em>. Second of all, if you need the Yiling Patriarch here to make you feel safe, well,\u201d he shrugs, pulling his lips back into a grin that he\u2019s been told isn\u2019t comforting at all.</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Yao\u2019s eyes catch on Chenqing and he takes several stumbling steps back, paling. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, exasperated.</p>\n<p>A couple of them had definitely noticed the flute anyway. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan, don\u2019t look at me like that! Sect Leader Yao is scared of A-Ning, I\u2019m trying to reassure him.\u201d No one\u2019s screaming, at least. He hopes it\u2019s because of shock and not because they don\u2019t find him intimidating anymore. How disappointing! Who knew all it would take to not be considered a legitimate threat would be wearing his sister\u2019s clothes? He should have tried that during the war. \u201cNow, give me Nie Mingjue\u2019s head and someone take Su She\u2019s gag off. We\u2019re getting to the bottom of all this once and for all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang\u2019s face is mostly covered by his fan, but Wei Wuxian has gotten up to too much mischief with him in his youth to miss the satisfaction lurking in the corners of his eyes. Interesting.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Sizhui is having a really weird day.</p>\n<p>Jingyi\u2019s hand is fisted in his sleeve, wrinkling it and causing his collar to be tugged slightly to one side, but he can\u2019t bring himself to pull away. It\u2019s comforting, grounding, and he thinks he needs that right now. A-die isn\u2019t exactly hovering over Wu Yingtai \u2013 Wei Wuxian \u2013 but he\u2019s pretty close.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian performs Empathy on Nie Mingjue\u2019s head, which Sizhui would have sworn was impossible if he wasn\u2019t seeing it done in front of him. Wei Wuxian weaves another tale of treachery and murder and then they interrogate Su She who confesses to even more, and it\u2019s a lot, for today, and Jin Ling keeps crying, stopping and starting again several times through everything. He\u2019s doing it silently now, but that\u2019s somehow worse. Wei Wuxian notices every time and reaches over to wipe his tears away with his \u2013 her? Jin Ling keeps saying both Uncle Ying and Aunt Ying but Sect Leader Jiang had referred to Wei Wuxian as his brother, so his, maybe \u2013 sleeve, even when he\u2019s not looking at him. It\u2019s a really terrible thing to be jealous over, so Sizhui shoves it down and does his best to ignore it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all very dramatic and interesting, but instead of any of that, his attention keeps wandering to Chenqing. Wei Wuxian is still holding it in his hands and there are little indents along one end. For some reason it makes Sizhui\u2019s jaw ache whenever he looks at it, and the Ghost General should be a terrifying sight, but there\u2019s something almost \u2013 if Sizhui had seen him on the street somewhere, he might have thought they\u2019d met somewhere before.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t really understand anything that\u2019s happening. Not the whole Jin Guangyao murder conspiracy \u2013 that\u2019s being laid out rather nearly in front of everyone \u2013 but the rest of it.</p>\n<p>Wu Yingtai is Wei Wuxian. The Yiling Patriarch. But Sizhui doesn\u2019t feel afraid or disgusted or any of that. How could he? Wu Yingtai had saved their lives and never been anything but friendly and helpful and kind. Which meant that Wei Wuxian had saved their lives and never been anything but friendly and helpful and kind. A-die\u2019s forehead ribbon is still in his hair and A-die seems content to leave it there. He\u2019d been genuinely surprised when Sect Leader Jiang had said that he and Wu Yingtai weren\u2019t engaged, which means sometime between then and now, he\u2019d figured out that Wu Yingtai is Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>He thinks it was before A-die gave him his forehead ribbon. He hopes it was, anyway.</p>\n<p>The night finally starts to end. Su She is taken to the cells underneath Jin Tower, Jin Guangyao\u2019s body is lifted away to be prepared for whatever last rites are given to traitors and murderers. Qin Su directs everything with a brisk efficiency that Sizhui doesn\u2019t remember seeing from her before, but it\u2019s hardly like he\u2019s been paying attention.</p>\n<p>Uncle doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s doing well, pale with his hands clenched tightly behind his back. Qin Su hardly seems phased by her husband\u2019s death, but considering she\u2019d dealt the killing blow, even if it had only been to alleviate Jin Ling\u2019s guilt, he supposes she wouldn\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019ll mourn later, in private, when her fury ebbs. Or, considering what Jin Guangyao had done to her and their son, maybe she won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Everyone is emptying out of the banquet hall when he and Jingyi make it back over to A-die and Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling is exhausted, leaning fully against Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s side in a way that he\u2019d be embarrassed about normally. Sect Leader Jiang is holding his sword for him. He hadn\u2019t wanted to touch it after Qin Su had tried to hand it back to him, and Sizhui knows that\u2019s not something that can last, but understandably no one seems interested in pushing it tonight. A-die only looks away from Wei Wuxian to send concerned glances to Uncle, but it never lasts more than a second before his gaze is pulled back to Wei Wuxian once more.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian notices him first, a huge grin immediately overtaking the bottom half of his face. \u201cSizhui, there you are! I know I said these things were boring, but wow, this sure showed me, huh?\u201d He reaches out a hand toward him, then freezes, something uncertain coming over his face as he almost but no quiet touches him.</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t want that. He understands it even less then when he thought he was Wu Yingtai, but Wei Wuxian still makes him feel safe, still feels familiar. He steps closer, tucking himself against Wei Wuxian\u2019s side and pulling his arm over his shoulders like he\u2019s wanted to do for hours, and says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. I was scared, earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian softens and reached out to pinch his cheek. For a moment he\u2019s very small and gets the embarrassing urge to cling to his leg, like he hasn\u2019t done since he was very small, and even then he\u2019d only done it to A-die. \u201cNo need to be scared! I\u2019ve been in far worse situations than that.\u201d He frowns, because that\u2019s not a good thing, but Wei Wuxian rubs his thumb between his eyebrows until his forehead relaxes. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d A-die says abruptly, staring at them with a strange expression on his face. \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks. \u201cOkay, Lan Zhan. What is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die opens his mouth, then closes it again, pressing his lips together.</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang rolls his eyes and says, \u201cAlright, you have fun with that. A-Ling and I are going to bed. A-Ying, you better be in your bed when I wake up tomorrow or so help me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks. \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang goes red and Jin Ling\u2019s lips twitch into something that might be a smile. But it drops just as quickly. \u201cUncle,\u201d he whines, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in my rooms,\u201d Sect Leader Jiang says, which seems like the sort of thing that would invite another argument, except Jin Ling relaxes and gives a relieved nod. \u201cAnd when we go home to Lotus Pier, you\u2019re coming with us. Aunt Su doesn\u2019t need you getting underfoot while she\u2019s cleaning all this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words sound harsh but for some reason they pull a real smile out of Jin Ling.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squeezes Sizhui\u2019s shoulder then lets go of him to step in front of Jin Ling, taking both his hands in his own and bending just enough to look him in the eye. \u201cThank you for saving me, A-Ling. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes, but mumbles, \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian and Sect Leader Jiang exchange a fond glance then Wei Wuxian shoos them away, \u201cAlright, go, get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sect Leader Jiang glares at A-die for a moment before steering Jin Ling down the hall towards where the Jiang are staying.</p>\n<p>Uncle lays a hand on Jingyi\u2019s shoulder, \u201cCome on, we should be getting some sleep too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jingyi ignores Uncle, reaching out to grab Sizhui\u2019s wrist. His eyes are wide and he tilts his head to the side, waiting, and Sizhui\u2019s hit with another wave affection for his best friend. He knows if he gives Jingyi any indication that he\u2019s not okay with this, that he wants him to stay, he\u2019ll tell their clan leader to shove it and take any punishment that results from it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, twisting his hand in Jingyi\u2019s grip so they\u2019re hold each other\u2019s forearms. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jingyi stares at him for a long moment, clearly looking for any indication he isn\u2019t being totally honest, but he mustn\u2019t find any because he nods and squeezes his arm before letting go. He turns to Wei Wuxian and punches him in the shoulder. \u201cYou need to be more careful! Just because you\u2019re the Yiling Patriarch doesn\u2019t mean you can be so reckless! Demonic cultivation can\u2019t put your head back on your neck!\u201d He pauses, frowning. \u201cRight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, reaching out to tug on the end of Jingyi\u2019s ponytail, who yelps and jumps away from him, glaring. \u201cRight! Thank you, Jingyi. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jingyi scowls then falls into step next to Uncle as they walk out of the banquet hall, giving him a suspicious glance. \u201cMaybe we should stop by the kitchens first. You\u2019re kind of pale, Sect Leader Lan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJingyi,\u201d Uncle sighs, but the warmth and exasperation tinging his voice is more emotion than he\u2019s showed in the hours since Jin Guanyao\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning rubs the back of his neck and says, \u201cI\u2019ll, um, be on the roof, I suppose? Just call if you need me, Ying-jie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns. \u201cYou can stay in my room, A-Ning, you hardly need to spend the night on the roof.\u201d Both Wen Ning and A-die raise an eyebrow at that, which makes no sense until Wei Wuxian says, \u201cOh, be quiet, it was different when I did it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d A-die says, cutting off what sounds like the beginnings of a familiar argument, \u201cWen Qionglin may accompany us. This concerns him as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning and Wei Wuxian share a baffled glance, but he only says, \u201cAll right, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die nods then turns and walks down the hall. After a moment they all follow. Sizhui studies the tense line of his father\u2019s shoulders, trying to figure out the cause, and coming up with nothing. There\u2019d been plenty of horrible things that had happened tonight, but none that could quite explain A-die\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p>He leads them to his room, shutting the door behind them and staying with his back to them for a long moment. Then he turns around and smooths hand hands down his robes, a nervous gesture that Sizhui\u2019s never seen from him. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian prompts, a frown on his face that says this is strange to him too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe child you mentioned earlier,\u201d A-die says, looking at the space over their shoulders. \u201cThe one that was yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s face creases in pain again, but then he says, \u201cA-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Sizhui says, surprise and warmth unfurling in his chest. Wei Wuxian is familiar with A-die and Sizhui wants him to be familiar with him too.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, turning to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he repeats, uncertain. \u201cYou said my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Wen Ning whispers, and he shouldn\u2019t be okay with a fierce corpse referring to him like that, with the Ghost General using his birth name, but he is, for some reason. It sounds right in his mouth even though Sizhui can\u2019t explain it.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches out, grabbing his hand with a bruising grip, but Sizhui doesn\u2019t pull away. He\u2019s looking him in the face even as he says, \u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t \u2013 is he really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSizhui,\u201d A-die says gently, \u201cI told you I found you on a battlefield, and that\u2019s true. But I did not tell you which one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t let go of his hand, but he does reach up a trembling hand to cup his face, running his thumb over his cheek. \u201cMy little radish. You\u2019ve grown.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s small again, suddenly, and the sun is bright and dirt is being piled on top of him while people laugh, and a gentle voice is telling him that it will help him grow, and the voice is different but the warmth is the same. He covers Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand with his own and his voice comes out thick when he says, \u201cYou planted me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted you to grow up big and strong,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s smiling, but he\u2019s crying too. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted, more than anything else, and you \u2013 look at you! As sweet and strong and perfect as I could have hoped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was already perfect when I got him,\u201d A-die says quietly. \u201cBecause of you. He got it from you, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath then turns and looks to Wen Ning, so Sizhui does too, and his face is scrunched like he\u2019d be crying if he could. \u201cWen Ning, look! It\u2019s our A-Yuan, all grown up.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more memories, faded and fuzzy, but Wen Ning looks the same and it\u2019s a little bit easier to make the connections. He remembers cold hands balancing him carefully on his hip and someone spoon feeding him soup. \u201cUncle Ning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian steps away, which is terrible, but then Wen Ning is there, pulling him into a careful hug, gentle and light like he\u2019s convinced Sizhui is going to push him away, so he throws his arms around Wen Ning\u2019s neck and holds on extra tight. Wen Ning\u2019s shoulders are shaking, but his grip becomes a little firmer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cYou saved him. You saved A-Yuan, and raised him, and \u2013 thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d A-die says. \u201cHe was your son. He was the only part of you I had left. I couldn\u2019t save you, but I could save your son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur son,\u201d Wei Wuxian corrects gently. Sizhui wouldn\u2019t have said that anything in his life was <em>wrong</em> before this, but now it feels right, something settling inside him that he hadn\u2019t even known was out of place. \u201cAre you saying \u2013 Lan Zhan that really sounds like \u2013 I don\u2019t want to assume\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning lets go of him so he can cover his face with his hands and Sizhui would laugh if he wasn\u2019t worried about ruining the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d A-die sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing my ribbon. I want you to <em>keep</em> wearing it. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ning,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and then there\u2019s a cold hand covering his eyes.</p>\n<p>Sizhui laughs and when several moments later when Wen Ning cautiously lowers his hand, Wei Wuxian is in A-die\u2019s arms, looking up at him with a soft eyed adoration, a look that A-die is returning. Their lips look a little bruised, which Sizhui is going to do his best not to think about, because gross.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s face crumples and Sizhui barely has the time to be worried before he says, \u201cLan Zhan, I can\u2019t leave the Jiang, especially with everything that just happened. I need to stay at Lotus Pier with A-Cheng and A-Ling. I can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to,\u201d A-die says. \u201cI\u2019ve regretted not staying at your side for thirteen years. I wanted to follow you then, and didn\u2019t. Let me do it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mouth drops open. \u201cDo you mean it, Lan Zhan? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d he says. \u201cIf joining the Jiang means I get to keep you, then I\u2019ll do it gladly. You don\u2019t need to come to Cloud Recesses. I will go to Lotus Pier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tugs him down again, but he only kisses A-die\u2019s bare forehead, where his ribbon would be if it wasn\u2019t in Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair. Then he looks to Sizhui, a question in his eyes that it seems like he can\u2019t bring himself to say out loud.</p>\n<p>Sizhui doesn\u2019t even need to think about it.</p>\n<p>He crosses the distance between them, tugging Wen Ning along with him. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cI just got you back, I\u2019m not giving you up. Besides,\u201d he adds brazenly, \u201cI was yours first, Xian-ge.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s face lights up, but Sizhui frowns, because that\u2019s not quite right. \u201cBaba,\u201d he amends, which is better, then \u201cA-niang,\u201d which is just as good.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Baba says, looking around all of them with bright eyes, him and A-die and Uncle Ning. \u201cYou\u2019ll all come to Lotus Pier, and A-Cheng and A-Ling will be there, and I\u2019ll have all my family in one place for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-die leans down and then Uncle Ning covers his eyes again as A-niang pushing himself up on his tip toes and Sizhui groans, but doesn\u2019t mind, really.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to have to figure out some sort of way to get on Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s good side. He\u2019ll have to ask if calling him uncle will help or not.</p>\n<p>If Jingyi isn\u2019t given an open invitation to visit Lotus Pier, which will now contain almost all of his favorite people, there will never again be peace in Cloud Recesses.</p>"
