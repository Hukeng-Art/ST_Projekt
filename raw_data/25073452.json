  "text": "<p>His father had given him very explicit instructions before he got on the train. He was to make friends with Harry Potter, no matter what. After his initial failed attempt, and considering Potter\u2019s family history and the company he\u2019s keeping, it\u2019s clear that he can only end up in one house.</p>\n<p>The hat is barely settled on his head, and Draco\u2019s thinking,\u00a0<em>GRYFFINDOR GRYFFINDOR GRYFFINDOR</em></p>\n<p><em>You don\u2019t have to shout</em>, the hat mutters,\u00a0<em>Now what would you do in Gryffindor? You\u2019re a Slytherin, boy, from your cunning mind to your ambitious heart. There\u2019s nowhere else for you.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gryffindor!\u00a0</em>he thinks, stubborn, because his father told him to do something, and he\u2019s going to do it. Shedding a snake skin to lumber under a lion fur comes with its own advantages, surely.</p>\n<p><em>And what will you do if young Mr. Potter doesn\u2019t end up in Gryffindor?\u00a0</em>it asks,\u00a0<em>What will you tell your father then?</em></p>\n<p><em>None of your business,\u00a0</em>he thinks.\u00a0<em>I\u2019m a Malfoy and a Slytherin asking to be sent to the lion\u2019s den, surely that means I have enough courage to qualify?</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause, far too long, and then,\u00a0<em>I suppose it does,\u00a0</em>right before it shouts, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall\u2019s eyes are huge behind her glasses, and Draco has to give the hat an impatient shake before she startles and takes it from him.</p>\n<p>Pansy is glaring at him something awful, and he blows her a kiss as he walks to the Gryffindor table. Blaise at least looks amused. He hesitates when he gets to the end because there\u2019s not exactly a lot of friendly faces staring at him, and the formerly open spaces have seemingly all closed up in the time it\u2019s taken from him to walk over. For the first time, it occurs to him that this might have been a mistake.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Longbottom says, face red as he scoots down on the bench. \u201cY-you can um, sit next to me. If \u2013 if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>His automatic response is to sneer, but it freezes on his face.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in enemy territory, masquerading as one of them. He needs friends otherwise this isn\u2019t going to work, needs to act like one of them or they\u2019ll never buy it, needs to act chivalrous, whatever that means. It probably means not sneering at people who are trying to help him, regardless of them being near-squibs from families that hate his.</p>\n<p>He smooths his face out. \u201cThank you, Neville,\u201d he says courteously as he takes the offered seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Er, uh, you\u2019re, um, y-you\u2019re welcome, D-Draco,\u201d he says, smiling nervously.</p>\n<p>Draco returns it. They\u2019re going to have to work on that stutter, and his speech patterns in general. Having a friend that\u2019s an embarrassment isn\u2019t going to do him any good, after all. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A moment later, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor, and ends up seated across from him, glaring. It\u2019s not even a very good glare. Clearly he hasn\u2019t had enough practice, or possibly a good enough teacher.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to be roommates, Harry,\u201d he says pleasantly. \u201cIsn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hm, okay, that glare is pretty good, actually. One of the Weasley twins sounds like he\u2019s having some sort of fit from the effort it\u2019s taking not to laugh, so maybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He ends up taking the bed between Neville and the wall, and this is another moment where he questions the wisdom of his choices. \u201cDid Gryffindor hate his students?\u201d he asks mournfully as he unpacks his trunk.</p>\n<p>Neville smiles, because he actually understands the joke, while Ron bristles and everyone else just looks confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco has a catty answer on the back of his tongue but ends up biting it back instead. He can\u2019t be like his father now, in this moment, sneering and domineering and forcing respect out of everyone he meets. He has to be his mother, blending and changing and cajoling her surroundings until they suit her. \u201cThe Slytherin dorms are two people to a room, and if there\u2019s an odd number then someone gets their own,\u201d he says. He was planning on sharing his room with Blaise. Either Vincent or Gregory would have been good too, but of course they wanted to room with each other. Theo was kind of intense, and possibly wanted to kill him, so they were all fine with letting him have his own room.</p>\n<p>Blaise and Theo will get on fine though, even if Blaise ends up having a lot less fun without Draco as a roommate. Although it\u2019ll be quieter.</p>\n<p>Which brings him to his second point. \u201cHow am I supposed to get any studying done here?\u201d he asks mournfully. \u201cYou lot don\u2019t seem the studious type.\u201d</p>\n<p>Is he really going to have to study in the library, where everyone can see him? No, that simply won\u2019t do. He\u2019ll have to find someplace else. It\u2019s a big castle, surely there\u2019s an unused room somewhere.</p>\n<p>Dean says, \u201cNow you sound like my mother,\u201d and Seamus cracks a grin too.</p>\n<p>Ron and Harry are glaring at him. \u201cStudying?\u201d Ron repeats in disgust. \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Is this a trick question? \u201cBecause we\u2019re at a school? To learn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Ron mutters, shaking his head as he crawls into his bed and takes out a pack of exploding snap before even bothering to unpack, a game which everyone else quickly joins. How does he expect to get ready in the morning with all his things packed away? Unless he plans to get up early, but something tells Draco that he\u2019s just not the type.</p>\n<p>Whatever. Befriending Harry Potter is second to his primary goal, which is graduating the top of their year. After he finishes his clothes, he goes on his books, but the amount he brought is just far too many to fit on the small shelves the Gryffindor\u2019s get. He would have had a whole bookshelf to himself in the Slytherin dorms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Neville whispers and points to his own empty shelf. \u201cY-you can, uh, put them there. I-if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. He\u2019s getting tired of saying it already but puts the rest of his books on Neville\u2019s shelf anyway.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re still playing when he finishes, and no one invites him to play with them, and he can\u2019t risk Neville doing it. He draws the curtains around his bed and pretends to go to sleep, listening to them laugh and play and get to know each other just a couple feet away, and thinks about how he could be hanging out with his own friends right now, but instead he\u2019s here, listening to all the fun he\u2019s not having.</p>\n<p>The first spell he\u2019s going to learn here is the silencing charm.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Draco wakes up before all the other boys the next morning and gets ready silently, doing his best not to wake everyone up. He hopes this is just because they stayed up late the night before, but he\u2019s not counting on it, and he mourns the loss of Blaise as his roommate. They\u2019re both early risers, so they would have woken at the same time and gotten ready while chatting and made their beds with the same impertinent flicks of their wands. They were planning on it, were looking forward to it, and now, well.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s most of the reason he\u2019s being so considerate as to not wake any of his dormmates. He doesn\u2019t exactly want an audience this morning.</p>\n<p>Draco puts on his red and gold tie, smooths his hand over the lion crest across his chest, hoists his book bag over his shoulder, and goes down to the great hall.</p>\n<p>The Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables are basically empty this early in the morning, but there are a fair amount of Slytherins, and the Hufflepuff table is nearly full. He detours from his own table to go to the Slytherin one, stopping awkwardly in front of the first years. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise is frowning and Pansy looks like she wants to rip his head off with her bare hands. Her being here is a bad sign, because she\u2019s not an early riser, which means she\u2019s here specifically to yell at him. Greg and Vinny wouldn\u2019t get out bed early for love or money so he\u2019ll have to wait to hear whatever opinions they have about his house.</p>\n<p>Daphne, his least favorite chess opponent but currently the best person in the world, leans around them to grin at him. \u201cGet a bit lost last night, didn\u2019t you Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, I can explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot believe,\u201d Pansy hisses, \u201cthat you\u2019re abandoning us so you can cling to Harry Potter\u2019s coattails.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s not like he would be friends with them if they were stupid. \u201cOkay, one, I\u2019m not abandoning you, Slytherins and Gryffindors have like all their classes together anyway and I promise I\u2019ll still double check all your homework,\u201d she looks slightly mollified at that, so at least some of her anger was related to her projected academic loss, \u201cand two, if anyone\u2019s riding on anyone\u2019s coattails, it\u2019s Harry on mine. You know he didn\u2019t even know he was a wizard until a couple weeks ago? It\u2019s like giving a baby a wand just to see what happens.\u201d He may have closed his curtains, but he hadn\u2019t gone asleep right away, and he was up more than long enough to overhear Harry talking to the others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDad was so mad when we did that to Lucas. Mum thought it was funny, though,\u201d Pansy muses.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was funny,\u201d he says, because it was. Lucus, barely a year old, had turned the whole east wing of the manor yellow, and hey, now his parents know for sure he isn\u2019t a squib, so really they were doing them a favor. \u201cCome on, you know what my dad told me to do. I\u2019m just following orders.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise finally relents, shoulders drooping. \u201cI\u2019m sharing a room with Theodore for seven years! It was supposed to be us, Draco!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco thinks back to the many conversations they\u2019ve had about how Theodore is possibly a psychopath, and the five boys he\u2019s forced to share a small space with, and says, \u201cBlaise, believe me when I say, I think I envy you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise tries to raise an eyebrow, trying to look as cool and aloof as his mum, but he doesn\u2019t quite manage it, biting his bottom lip to stifle a laugh and failing.</p>\n<p>Some of the uneasiness he\u2019s been carrying around settles. He\u2019s not doing this alone. Even if all of Gryffindor hates him forever, he still has his friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cOI, MALFOY!\u201d He turns, wide eyed, and one of the Weasley twins is waving at him. He cups his hands around his mouth, even though the great hall isn\u2019t nearly full or noisy enough to justify it. \u201cYOU\u2019RE AT THE WRONG TABLE!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Pansy says, \u201cI think the consequences of your actions are punishment enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes and elbows her before throwing a quick smile at Blaise and Daphne and going over to the Gryffindor table.</p>\n<p>His table.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Severus and McGonagall keep whispering at mealtimes and looking at him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very distracting.</p>\n<p>He stays after the next potion class, waving Neville along when he tries to wait for him. He hesitates, clearly pulled between wanting to get as far away from Severus as quickly as possible and not wanting to leave Draco alone with him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Neville is so endearing it\u2019s painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, I promise,\u201d he says. Neville shoots him one more worried look then hurries out the door.</p>\n<p>Draco shuts the door then turns to his godfather and crosses his arms. \u201cOkay, what gives?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus doesn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand him. It\u2019s one of the reasons Draco like him so much. He never acts like that Draco is less intelligent than he is. \u201cMinerva is worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Does she think I\u2019m going to curse one of her precious lion cubs in their sleep?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed,\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>are one of her precious lion cubs, thanks to your father\u2019s idiotic instructions.\u201d His godfather hadn\u2019t been pleased about Draco not being in his house. \u201cShe\u2019s worried that you\u2019re having trouble making friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have plenty of friends,\u201d he says, and he does. There are all his friends in Slytherin, and Susan Bones has latched onto him as a study partner. He\u2019s known Lisa Turpin and Sue Li since he was a toddler, and they\u2019re just as annoying and friendly as they\u2019ve ever been. They\u2019ve already talked about how they can break into the school\u2019s broom closet to get some flying in before their first official lesson, which seems like a waste for anyone who\u2019s not a muggleborn. Who doesn\u2019t know how to ride a broom, honestly.</p>\n<p>Severus is unmoved. \u201cShe\u2019s worried that you\u2019re having trouble making friend in your house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Neville,\u201d he says. \u201cI think maybe the Weasley twins too, but they might just be acting friendly with me to piss Ron off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lavender is nice too, but she\u2019s nice like she\u2019s keeping all her options open and may decide to be mean later and hasn\u2019t yet made up her mind, so he\u2019s a bit wary of her.</p>\n<p>Severus only raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. Stop staring at me in the great hall, it\u2019s not helping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware your housemates being close minded little brats is a judgement on them and not you, right?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Draco smiles. He almost hugs him, but he knows Severus hates it. He endures it sometimes, as he considers it his duty as his godfather to hug him occasionally, but he\u2019s never thrilled about it. \u201cHey, that\u2019s my house you\u2019re talking about. Watch it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus just rolls his eyes and sends him on his way.</p>\n<p>Draco nearly walks right into Neville as he steps out of the potions classroom</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d he asks, looking around at the deserted hallway.</p>\n<p>Neville shrugs, but gives him a once over, like he\u2019s looking to see if he\u2019s been maimed in the last couple minutes. \u201cEr, n-nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late for charms,\u201d he says, hopelessly fond in spite of himself.</p>\n<p>He may not have the quantity of friends he\u2019d like, but the quality is rather excellent.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Draco hadn\u2019t thought that his first friend in their year besides Neville would be\u00a0<em>Hermione Granger</em>, of all people. He\u2019d thought she was kind of embarrassing and way too high strung, personally.</p>\n<p>But there was one positive thing about her that\u2019s rather undeniable.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s\u00a0<em>brilliant</em>.</p>\n<p>He keeps bumping into her in the library, since he still hasn\u2019t scoped out a good part of the castle to hide away and study in. Clearly he can\u2019t do it in his dorm or the common room, since everyone is\u00a0<em>loud</em>. There are plenty of Gryffindors who study in the common room and he doesn\u2019t understand how they do it, he can barely hear himself think in there most days. Maybe he should ask Percy. Draco never sees him studying in there, so surely he\u2019s found a better spot to do it in? But it\u2019s also possible he doesn\u2019t study at all and just absorbs his knowledge through osmosis, so maybe he wouldn\u2019t have any advice to offer.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pity he can\u2019t just spend a couple hours a day hiding away in the Slytherin common room. Well, he could, he\u2019s known where it is for years and it\u2019s not like his godfather is going to care if he\u2019s there, even if his tie is red and gold. But he can\u2019t do that, because if people just think he\u2019s a Slytherin in Gryffindor, then they\u2019ll treat him like a Slytherin, and this whole thing is pointless.</p>\n<p>Which means he spends a lot of time in the library with Hermione Granger.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine, they\u2019re doing a great job at ignoring each other, up until a shadow falls over his reading light and he looks up to see her scowling at him. \u201cAre you almost done with that? I need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s pointing at the book he\u2019s reading, which is an advanced tome on the healing properties of various magical insects. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way this can be relevant to anything she\u2019s reading. It\u2019s barely relevant to him, they just have a potion with acromantula hair coming up, and he knows Severus is going to grill him with as many too complicated, ridiculous questions as he can think of. Just because Draco\u2019s his godson doesn\u2019t mean he takes any less joy from taking points from Gryffindor, and he\u00a0<em>expects</em>\u00a0Draco to know the answer, unlike everyone else who he\u2019s mostly just harassing. An unfortunate side effect of receiving potion lectures as bedtime stories since before he could speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d she insists. \u201cThis recipe for a vanishing potion doesn\u2019t make any sense, and I think it might if I read that. Can you just give it to me when you\u2019re done?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyebrows push together. \u201cWhat recipe are you looking at? It\u2019s a straightforward potion.\u201d It\u2019s actually the same potion he\u2019s reading this book for, but the brewing is hardly complicated. It\u2019s a first year potion, after all.</p>\n<p>Her scowl deepens. She stomps over to her bag, pulls out their potion book, then flips it open to a page she\u2019s bookmarked and drops it front of him.</p>\n<p>Merlin, she\u2019s so dramatic.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the beginning of beautiful friendship filled with arguing over every bit of academic minutia they come across and Neville trying and failing to keep the peace between them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>On one hand, Draco is excited about their first flying lesson, because flying is brilliant. On the other hand, their first lesson is sure to be incredibly boring, because it\u2019s basic stuff like getting a broom to listen to you and not falling off. Still, flying is flying.</p>\n<p>Both the Gryffindors and Slytherins are assembled on the field, and instead of talking to his friends in Slytherin, he finds himself in the unenviable position of having to\u00a0<em>reassure\u00a0</em>Hermione, who looks like they\u2019re somewhere truly terrible, like history of magic, rather than a flying lesson. \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d he tells her, \u201cAll you have to do is not fall off. Right, Neville?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville jumps then looks down at his shoes. \u201cO-oh. Um. I\u2019ve never f-flown before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s not thrilled with his stutter. They\u2019d been working on that. \u201cNeville! Why not?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m clumsy. Gran said I\u2019d c-crack my head open.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bloody hell. \u201cDidn\u2019t your uncle push you down the stairs to see if you were a squib and you just bounced down like you were made of rubber?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers, looking a little green at the memory.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why would you crack your head open if you fell off your broom?\u201d he demands. He\u2019s aware that\u2019s not exactly how it works, that possibly his wandless magic wouldn\u2019t save him if he\u2019d fallen on his head, but it\u2019s the principal of the whole thing. He turns to the rest of the Gryffindors. \u201cYou\u2019ve all flown, haven\u2019t you? Not you, Harry, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks offended at that for some reason, which, really, he was raised by muggles, why would he have flown before?</p>\n<p>Ron, Dean, and Lavender nod, but Seamus and Parvati shake their head. Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says, turning back to Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ve been flying for years and it\u2019s not that hard. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed she will, Mister Malfoy,\u201d Madame Hooch says from right behind him, and he only doesn\u2019t jump due to his cousin Luna thinking it\u2019s the funniest thing ever to hide behind things to try and scare him at family dinners. \u201cNow, everyone stand next to a broom, put your dominant hand over it, and say Up! Be very firm!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUP!\u201d says a chorus of voices. Every broom on the Slytherin side rises smoothly into their riders\u2019 hands. His, Harry\u2019s, and Ron\u2019s do the same, but Dean, Seamus, Lavender, and Parvati have to say it a couple more times to get their brooms to float begrudgingly into their hands.</p>\n<p>Neville\u2019s just turns over sullenly and Hermione\u2019s doesn\u2019t react at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to be firm,\u201d he hisses. \u201cThe broom can tell if you\u2019re scared, so you can\u2019t let it know. If you could stop being scared, that\u2019d be good too, but lying about it might be easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should worry less about your classmates and more about yourself, Mister Malfoy,\u201d Madam Hooch says, her eyes narrowed in disapproval. \u201cYou\u2019re holding your broom with the wrong hand. Have you been doing that incorrectly for years as well?\u201d</p>\n<p>His face burns and he goes to switch hands, but Hermione says hotly, \u201cHe\u2019s left handed! You said to summon it with your dominant hand, not your right hand. If you\u2019d wanted him to summon it with his right hand, that\u2019s what you should have said.\u201d It\u2019s easily the rudest Draco has ever seen her be to a professor. She scowls and puts her hand over her broom. \u201cUp!\u201d</p>\n<p>It jumps promptly into her hand this time, probably afraid that if it didn\u2019t, she might yell at it too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Madame Hooch says, suddenly not looking at him, \u201cvery good, Miss Granger. Mister Longbottom, if you would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville swallows, pushes his shoulders back, and says, \u201cUp!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment when nothing happens, and then the broom slowly rises into his hand.</p>\n<p>Draco doesn\u2019t cheer because that would be kind of lame of him, but he smiles when the other Gryffindors do.</p>\n<p>Then they\u2019re just hovering a couple feet off the ground which, boring, but he can kind of see the point of it when half of his house seems unsteady on their brooms. Except, of course, something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re only supposed to be a couple feet off the ground, but Neville keeps rising.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Longbottom!\u201d Madame Hooch shouts, \u201cStop that and get down here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville panics and grabs the front part of his broom, pushing down, which is of course is the worst thing he could have done. It sends him shooting upward way too quickly, and Draco rushes after him. He doesn\u2019t think about it, he just goes, and he\u2019s familiar enough with a broom that he can maneuver it thoughtlessly. He\u2019s nearly caught up to Neville, already reaching out a hand to steady his friend\u2019s broom, when Neville loses his balance and falls.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>one thing</em>\u00a0Draco had told him not to do!</p>\n<p>He dives for him, but gravity is faster than he is, and Neville is screaming. Draco grabs the handle of his broom tightly in one hand and jumps off his own broom, reaching out to grab Neville\u2019s hand. He\u00a0<em>feels</em>\u00a0Neville\u2019s shoulder pop out when he catches him, but there\u2019s not much he can do about it. He\u2019s holding both his and Neville\u2019s weight with just one hand, and it\u2019s pretty much all he can do not to drop him as they gently float the last dozen or so feet to the ground.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until Neville is standing and Draco\u2019s feet touch the ground that he can hear everything around him, that he hears his classmates shouting or notices Madame Hooch\u2019s pale face as she looks Neville over, prodding delicately at his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go to Madame Pomfrey for that dear, nothing for it, come along now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He should have caught him sooner.</p>\n<p>Neville offers him a watery smile and says, \u201cBetter my shoulder than my head, Draco. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour gran may have had a point,\u201d he says, rubbing the back of his neck. Actually, his shoulders are kind of sore too, but not enough for him to go to Pomfrey about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Malfoy,\u201d Madam Hooch says, and great, he\u2019s going to get a lecture about flying when he wasn\u2019t supposed to, \u201cthirty points to Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still blinking in confusion when she turns and shuffles Neville towards the castle.</p>\n<p>Everyone is staring at him, and usually he loves being the center of attention, but not like this. Blaise throws something into the air and catches it again. \u201cLongbottom dropped this. Fancy a game?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s confused for a moment before he sees it\u2019s a Remembrall, one of Neville\u2019s gifts from his grandmother that seemed to cause him more grief than not. He grins. \u201cOh, yeah. Definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to you!\u201d Ron says crossly.</p>\n<p>Draco rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it\u00a0<em>back</em>. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s using it right now, is he?\u201d And actually, if they manage to accidentally break it during the game, all the better. It\u2019ll give Neville one less thing to worry over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to fly without the instructor here to supervise,\u201d Hermione says disapprovingly, because nothing gives her as much joy as ruining his fun.</p>\n<p>He nods seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but consider this \u2013 Hooch isn\u2019t here and it\u2019ll be a great practical learning experience. Also, she never\u00a0<em>said\u00a0</em>that, you just know that because you read Hogwarts, A History, so it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t seem convinced, but doesn\u2019t continue arguing, so he\u2019ll count that a win.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlytherins versus Gryffindors?\u201d Theo proposes.</p>\n<p>No, because he can already here all the snide comments he\u2019ll get from his housemates about him being on the wrong team. And he wants to win, and all the Slytherins have way more flying experience than the Gryffindors. \u201cGirls versus boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Pansy says. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. There are nine of you and six of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit out,\u201d Vinny volunteers instantly. He hates flying. \u201cI\u2019ll be referee.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione is clearly pissed that that hadn\u2019t occurred to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll play on the girls\u2019 team,\u201d Draco says. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be seven against seven. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy narrows her eyes, then says, \u201cOkay, deal. Rules?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise tosses the Remembrall into the air again. \u201cLet\u2019s play catch. You can\u2019t hold the Remembrall for more than five seconds and no spells while we\u2019re in the air. Winner is whatever team has the Remembrall when Hooch gets back. Getting caught breaking the rules is an automatic loss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looks pleased at the last bit at least.</p>\n<p>Hermione and Greg are hovering on the perimeter just in case it comes their way, but aren\u2019t interest in chasing it, which is fine because the teams are still even. It quickly becomes clear that this is mostly a competition between him and Harry.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s the best at throwing it, but Harry\u2019s scarily good at catching it, especially considering this is his first time a broom. Harry always catches it if anyone but Draco throws it, so the girls\u2019 strategy just becomes getting it to Draco and then flying way wider than anyone else can throw. Obviously he feels bad that Neville got hurt, but this is way more fun than the typical first flying lesson, although unfortunately they\u2019re all a little too good to drop the Remembrall and not have someone catch it, so that part of his plan doesn\u2019t work out.</p>\n<p>Vinny had been on the lookout for Madam Hooch, so he hadn\u2019t noticed a tabby cat sitting on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Draco blames him when McGonagall makes Harry the youngest seeker in a century.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only a little bit mollified when McGonagall says she would have offered Draco a chaser position if one had been open.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Ron made Hermione cry and the only thing that stop Draco from hexing his face off is Neville\u2019s hands gripping his elbow, tugging him down the hall and away from them. \u201cSleep with one eye open tonight, Weasley,\u201d he hisses, finally letting Neville drag him away.</p>\n<p>Ron scoffs but Harry is frowning, so maybe he\u2019ll knock some sense into Ron so Draco doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>It takes a while, but they track her down in the girls\u2019 bathroom closest to the Slytherin dorms. He can hear her crying still, and actually, maybe he doesn\u2019t care what Harry does about it, Ron\u2019s face is going to have a standing appointment with his fist for making Hermione cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Neville calls out as they hover by the doorway. There\u2019s no one around because everyone\u2019s at the Hallow\u2019s Eve feast, so Draco doesn\u2019t actually have a problem with ducking into the girls\u2019 bathroom to drag Hermione out, but Neville had said that wouldn\u2019t help, and he is the resident expert on breakdowns. \u201cRon\u2019s just a jerk, everyone knows that. Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he even say?\u201d Draco asks.</p>\n<p>Neville glances at the door then whispers, \u201cHe called Hermione an obnoxious know-it-all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seriously?</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is an obnoxious know-it-all!\u201d he shouts, swatting Neville away when he tries to cover his mouth. \u201cAre you joking? You hear that Hermione? You\u2019re annoying and obnoxious and a huge pain, you\u2019re a brown-nosing know-it-all who\u2019s never happy unless you\u2019re the smartest person in the room!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Neville groans, still trying to shove his hand over Draco\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>He dodges Neville\u2019s frantic hands. \u201cDo you hear me? Are you listening? You\u2019re an obnoxious know-it-all, and that\u2019s why I like you! If you were any less annoying, we wouldn\u2019t be friends!\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville finally stops trying to smother him, at least. There\u2019s a long pause, then Hermione says, watery but still loud enough for them to hear her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d he confirms. \u201cI like that you\u2019re rude and mean and you think people are dumb. I like your arrogance and your anger and how you\u2019d rip McGonagall\u2019s throat out if you thought it would get you higher in the class rankings. I like that you\u2019re reading your way through the whole damn library and that you don\u2019t need a dictionary to do it, and I like how much you <em>care</em> about dumb things like rules because someone has to, and it\u2019s not going to be me!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long moment of silence, and then Hermione\u2019s in front of them, her eyes red and tear tracks on her cheeks, but she\u2019s smiling again, and that\u2019s all that really matters. Then the blood drains from her face and she grabs onto the front of both their robes, yanking them inside the girls\u2019 bathroom, hissing, \u201cThere\u2019s a troll behind you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I know he\u2019s awful to you, but that\u2019s still not a very nice thing to call Professor Snape,\u201d he says, but he doesn\u2019t put much heat into it. Severus really is awful to her. He\u2019s gotten a little better since she\u2019s obviously became Draco\u2019s friend, since he plays favorites and his godson is obviously one of his favorites, but not by much. Then there\u2019s Neville, but he\u2019s not sure how much of that Draco can really blame on Severus. Neville can turn the easiest and safest potion into a bubbling catastrophe ready to explode, all on accident, and when Severus is worried he just yells louder. Draco had elected to be Neville\u2019s partner a little bit because Neville is his friend, and a lot because if he didn\u2019t stop Neville from nearly blowing up his cauldron, Severus was going to have a stroke in the middle of class.</p>\n<p>Hermione slaps his arm. \u201cNo, you idiot, a literal troll!\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks at her then peeks out the door.</p>\n<p>Merlin.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s actually a troll.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming this way,\u201d he says, too panicked for his voice to come out as anything besides completely monotone. \u201cLike, straight for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Hermione demands.</p>\n<p>He stares. \u201cI don\u2019t know! Why would I know that? I\u2019ve never seen a troll before. Haven\u2019t you <em>read </em>about them or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d she says, \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s very useful. They\u2019re very strong, resistant to magic, and love the taste of human flesh. They\u2019re also attracted to bad smells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville covers his face with his hands. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die. Then Gran is going to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe can\u2019t kill you if you\u2019re already dead,\u201d Draco points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoken like someone who\u2019s never met Gran,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Hermione yanks them both into a stall as the lumbering gets closer. \u201cOkay, but really, does no one have any good ideas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly have a bad smell spell handy,\u201d he says. \u201cI <em>do</em> have some dungbombs, but they\u2019re in my trunk, so not much use here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Quirrell fight a lot of theses?\u201d Neville whispers. \u201cDid he ever mention how?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re silent for a moment, then Draco says, \u201cHypnoses, I think, but I don\u2019t know how to hypnotize a troll.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a giant smelly troll smashing a club around and they\u2019re too busy scrambling around the small bathroom trying not to die. They figure out pretty quickly that it\u2019s at least really, really dumb. They scatter and two hide while one distracts it, then they switch, trying to keep in confused and swinging it\u2019s club not at them long enough for someone to show up.</p>\n<p>When Ron and Harry run inside, Draco realizes he should have been more specific. He was hoping more for a professor. Like his godfather or his head of house.</p>\n<p>The troll raises its club over its head and Harry and Ron are obviously too dumb to <em>run</em> and Draco\u2019s going to watch his whole reason for joining Gryffindor get spattered into a human pancake right in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWingardium leviosa!\u201d</p>\n<p>The club slides out of the troll\u2019s hands and Draco turns to look at Neville, who\u2019s red and sweating and more scared than Draco\u2019s ever seen him, but he\u2019s holding the club aloft, out of the troll\u2019s reach. Then he slashes his arm downward, and the club goes the same way, hitting the top of the troll\u2019s thick skull with enough force that Draco hears something crack. He doesn\u2019t think it was the club.</p>\n<p>The troll goes tumbling to the ground and Draco has to scramble out of the way to avoid being crushed, but then it\u2019s just the five of them standing around a troll with a pool of blood growing beneath its head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you two idiots doing here?\u201d Draco asks scathingly as he presses his shoulder against Neville, who\u2019s pale and shaking but <em>standing</em>, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we \u2013 we were looking for you! We heard there was a troll in the dungeon and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Hermione snaps. \u201cRemembered I was here but instead of doing something useful like, oh I don\u2019t know, grabbing a professor and telling them, you decided to come down all on your own? Fat lot of good that did us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry puts his hand on Ron\u2019s shoulder before he can open and his mouth and make everything worse, as he\u2019s so good at doing. \u201cWe just \u2013 we wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco is so completely, incandescently mad that it\u2019s a really good thing that McGonagall, Severus, and Quirrell choose that moment to arrive, because if they hadn\u2019t Draco would have cast one of the jinxes his mother taught him that he\u2019s definitely not supposed to know about yet.</p>\n<p>Hermione lays out everything that happened, and predictably everyone\u2019s pissed at Ron and Harry, which, like, what did they <em>expect</em>? If Neville hadn\u2019t been so quick, not only would they have gotten themselves killed, but they would have gotten them killed too, since they were too busy being worried to grab someone competent to help them. He still winces at the amount of points McGonagall takes from Gryffindor because hey, that\u2019s his house too.</p>\n<p>McGonagall\u2019s announced that she\u2019s going to escort them back to the common room when Severus says, \u201cMister Malfoy, one moment if you please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione and Neville are nervous, but Draco just shoos them away. He should probably tell them that Severus is his godfather if this keeps up, but he doesn\u2019t want them to feel bad for disliking him or for them to think they can\u2019t get mad at him around Draco.</p>\n<p>He waits until they\u2019re definitely alone before turning to Severus, opening his mouth to ask a question he never gets to voice. Severus grabs him and crushes him to his chest, holding him so tightly for a moment that it\u2019s almost painful. Draco doesn\u2019t even get the chance to return it before Severus pushes him away and looks him in the eye. \u201cIf something happens to you, your mother will kill me. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened to me!\u201d he protests. \u201cI was just waiting for Hermione so we could go to the feast. How did a troll get into the dungeon anyway? It\u2019s not like they can just walk through the front doors!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Severus says, his concern falling away into something colder, but Draco knows it\u2019s not directed at him. \u201cIt can\u2019t.\u201d Draco raises an eyebrow but Severus just shakes his head and squeezes Draco\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you back to your common room so I can be sure you won\u2019t get into any more trouble on the way there. Have you started on the essay that\u2019s due next week yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s due <em>next</em> <em>week</em>,\u201d he points out, but actually he and Hermione has worked out the outline yesterday.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Dean and Seamus are carefully, pointedly not taking sides in the whole thing, and Harry probably would have been willing to let it all go if Draco had been, but he <em>isn\u2019t</em>. They\u2019d been stupid and their stupidity had nearly got everyone killed. So he and Neville are kind of fighting with Harry and Ron, and on one hand he\u2019s never been further from his goal of becoming Harry Potter\u2019s friend, but on the other hand he doesn\u2019t <em>care</em> because Harry and Ron could have gotten his actual friends hurt, and he doesn\u2019t care for that at all.</p>\n<p>The girls are all on their side, because Neville singlehandedly taking out a troll has made him kind of notorious in a way he hates but Draco thinks is hilarious. He\u2019s lived his whole life as kind of notorious, he\u2019s the son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. He spends a lot time trying to show Neville how to just smile and ignore people, which is a very important skill for a notorious sort of person. If Harry wasn\u2019t being such a jerk, Draco would teach him too, but he is so he\u2019s on his own.</p>\n<p>Things definitely aren\u2019t improved after Harry and Ron become convinced that Harry\u2019s broom was cursed during a quidditch game, which Draco supposes is theoretically possible, but they think that his godfather did it, which definitely isn\u2019t possible. Draco threatens to hex their skin off if they don\u2019t keep their terrible ideas to themselves. Severus is unpleasant sometimes and kind of mean to a lot of people, but he\u2019s <em>Draco\u2019s godfather</em>, so if people want to hate him they have to do it based on one of his many personality flaws, not based on crap that he hasn\u2019t even done.</p>\n<p>The one good thing about all of this is that he\u2019s more or less successfully intermixed his two main friend groups. Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t exactly <em>huge </em>fans of all his Slytherin friends, but they can all hang out without getting into a fight that escalates past a dull roar, which he thinks is very responsible of them. Blaise and Neville are even proper friends, and he\u2019s pretty sure Hermione and Daphne are well on their way. Pansy still doesn\u2019t care for either of them, but she and Lavender Brown sit next to each other during every shared class and spend it whispering to each other and giggling, so Draco\u2019s willing to call it all a win.</p>\n<p>The year is coming to a close, and he\u2019s no closer to being Harry Potter\u2019s friend than when it started, which is a bit of a disappointment, but he hadn\u2019t counted on Harry being so unlikable. He still has the next six years, after all, and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019ll find him and Ron a lot more tolerable after a summer apart, and maybe they\u2019ll even manage to be friends next year.</p>\n<p>He keeps on thinking that until Hermione is shaking him awake in the middle of the night, her eyes wide as she says, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Neville, come here. I don\u2019t know if we should go to Pomfrey or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco automatically looks to the bed next to his, but it\u2019s empty, and so is Ron and Harry\u2019s. His heart sinks. That can\u2019t mean anything good.</p>\n<p>He follows Hermione downstairs and find Neville stunned which is just \u2013 great, that\u2019s what it is, just perfect. \u201cFinite incantum!\u201d he snaps, and he\u2019s not actually that good at this spell, but the magic must sense how angry he is because it doesn\u2019t argue him, undoing the stunning jinx with little fuss. Neville comes awake slowly, shaking his head and blinking until his face clears a little. \u201cNeville, are you okay? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>His teeth are chattering, which isn\u2019t a good sign. Just how long had he been laying down here before Hermione noticed him? What was Hermione doing up in the middle of the night anyway? \u201cI \u2013 Ron and Harry woke me up when they were leaving, and they were talking about going to the third floor corridor, and then \u2013 then, uh,\u201d he trails off, forehead creasing in confusion.</p>\n<p>Draco wraps an arm around his shoulders, \u201cHey it\u2019s okay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has been stunned way too long. Nothing a competent medi-witch can\u2019t fix, he thinks. He hopes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake him to the hospital wing,\u201d Draco orders Hermione.</p>\n<p>She glares. \u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to the third floor corridor and hex our precious housemates\u2019 faces off and then drag them back here so McGonagall can kill them,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one that was mad at them for going off on their own instead of getting a professor?\u201d Hermione protests.</p>\n<p>Draco rolls his eyes. \u201cReally, Hermione, come on. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s going to be a <em>troll </em>there. I\u2019m just going to get them back.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He\u2019s an <em>idiot</em>. Hermione\u2019s going to kill him, or worse, never let him live this down.</p>\n<p>Why did he jump down the trap door to avoid the angry three headed dog? Why hadn\u2019t he gone for the door he\u2019d came in? Okay, it was because the trap door had been closer and it seemed the choice that would most likely end with him not being dog food.</p>\n<p>Except now he\u2019s waist deep in devil\u2019s snare and really hopping he\u2019s remembering Neville\u2019s excited chattering about this plant accurately, because otherwise he\u2019s not going to be capable of remembering anything for very long. \u201cLumos!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ow.</p>\n<p>He rubs his side, looking up at the squirming nest of devil\u2019s snare. Well, unfortunately, no other way to go but forward. Harry and Ron <em>better</em> be around here somewhere.</p>\n<p>The next is a room full of enchanted keys, of all things, and well there\u2019s a <em>locked door</em> and a <em>broom</em>, it\u2019s not exactly hard to figure out what he\u2019s supposed to do here, and really, what in Merlin\u2019s name is going on? Is this some sort of obstacle course for the seventh years or something? Except if it is, it\u2019s going to need some serious redesign. Draco is brilliant and determined to be the top of their class if he has to crawl over Hermione to do it, but he\u2019s also a <em>first year</em>. If he can get past even one of these things, then it\u2019s not going to be a match for the seventh years.</p>\n<p>He finally catches up with Ron and Harry when he steps onto a huge chessboard and snaps, \u201cWhat do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>A piece moves off the board and Ron shouts, \u201cDraco! What are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I doing here? What are <em>you</em> doing here? You just left Neville stunned on the ground! You\u2019re lucky Hermione found him when she did, you idiots. We\u2019re going back right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Harry says, so grim and serious and adult sounding that Draco\u2019s protest dies on his lips. \u201cDraco, we can\u2019t, Voldemort\u2019s here, and he\u2019s after the philosopher\u2019s stone, and we have to stop him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you have to play now,\u201d Ron adds, glancing across the chess board. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re the queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cThis is insane! If Voldemort is really here \u2013 and he\u2019s supposed to be <em>dead</em>, might I add \u2013 then what do you expect to do against them? Why, and I\u2019m really getting sick of asking you this, didn\u2019t you get a <em>professor</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe tried,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cMcGonagall didn\u2019t believe us and Dumbledore\u2019s gone. We didn\u2019t have anyone else, and we can\u2019t just let him win.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bites back the retort burning on his tongue. If they\u2019d come to him, he could have gone to Severus, and his godfather would have listened to him. Even if didn\u2019t believe him, he would have at least checked. But he and Harry aren\u2019t friends, so there\u2019s no reason for Harry to come to him with this, so no way Draco could have gotten his godfather to handle it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cNot that I\u2019m saying I think Voldemort is really here either, because come on, look at the defenses they set up, they have not Voldemort level. But okay. I\u2019ll play along. And then when we\u2019re done with whatever all this is, we go back to the common room and you tell Neville that you\u2019re sorry. Deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Harry glance at each other then nod at the same time. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bloody hell. This night has turned into such a mess.</p>\n<p>He takes the place of the queen and follows Ron\u2019s instructions, and seriously, can\u2019t they see how wrong this is? Ron\u2019s a fantastic chess player, Draco can\u2019t deny that, but he\u2019s not the <em>best</em> chess player, not by a long shot, not yet even though Draco\u2019s pretty sure that he will be in the future. What kind of defense set up against Voldemort could be beaten by anything but the best? A first year should not be able to beat this chess game. A seventh year shouldn\u2019t be able to beat it. It should take someone as shrewd and calculating as his own mother to get them through this game, but Ron is doing great, Ron\u2019s winning, which should really tell them everything they need to know.</p>\n<p>They win the game, but Ron doesn\u2019t quite move fast enough from an enchanted chess piece\u2019s downward swing, getting grazed by the side of the stone sword and falling to the ground with a groan.</p>\n<p>As soon the king throws down his crown, he and Harry are running towards Ron. He\u2019s not bleeding but he\u2019s got a huge bump on the back of his head and his eyes are glazed over, and great, that\u2019s two housemates with brain injuries tonight, that\u2019s just perfect. \u201cWe have to get him to the hospital wing now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s terrified, his hands cradling Ron\u2019s face, but he still shakes his head. \u201cNo. Not until we get the philosopher\u2019s stone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco can\u2019t believe this. \u201cYou really think Voldemort is down here, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying!\u201d he shouts, emerald eyes narrowed in anger. \u201cWhy would I lie about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He just rubs his forehead and says, \u201cCome on, help me prop him up against the wall. My aguamenti is pretty shoddy, but I should be able to get enough water to use the freezing charm, which I\u2019m pretty good at.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asks, just staring at him.</p>\n<p>Draco makes an improvised ice pack and gently eases it against the back of Ron\u2019s head. \u201cWell, if you really think you\u2019re facing something as dangerous as Voldemort, you can\u2019t go alone. So Ron\u2019s just going to have to wait until we have this philosopher\u2019s stone, although why there\u2019d be one in Hogwarts at the end of this obstacle course I have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me?\u201d Harry asks.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s getting a little tired of his incredulity. \u201c<em>Yes</em>. Now let\u2019s go. The sooner we finish this, whatever it is, the sooner we can get Ron to the hospital wing.\u201d Which is where Hermione is already, he hopes, because he\u2019s equally hopeful she\u2019ll have told Madame Pomfrey where the three of them ran off to, so that someone will come after them. Hopefully his godfather, but at this point he\u2019ll take pretty much any competent adult.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Harry says even as he rushes after him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turns on his heel to glare at him. \u201cOf course I like you! I\u2019ve been trying really hard to like you all year, you just keep ruining it by being an idiot!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry blinks. \u201cUh. Well. I like you too. Even if you\u2019re kind of awful sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m </em>kind of \u2013 okay, you know what, we don\u2019t have time to have this argument right now,\u201d he decides. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room contains an unconscious troll, and Draco makes an uncomfortable connection. \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think it was Voldemort who came through here. I think it was Quirrell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be a good thing, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry asks, frowning at him.</p>\n<p>Draco shakes his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think the troll that got in during Hallow\u2019s Eve \u2013 Quirrell should have been able to stop it, shouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s what he\u2019s famous for after all. Troll hunting. But he didn\u2019t. He fainted, of all things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry says, eyes flickering to the next set of doors. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to come with me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was saying!\u201d he shouts. \u201cStop telling me to go back, I\u2019m a Gryffindor just like you, and I\u2019m not leaving you alone, got it? We leave together or we don\u2019t leave at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes widen then his whole face softens into a smile. \u201cOkay. I got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says shortly, and then strides through the doors.</p>\n<p>The fire that jumps up on either side is really ominous. The riddle isn\u2019t too hard to figure out, which is just one more thing that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Draco loves Severus\u2019s riddles and logic games, his godfather has been using them to entertain him since he was a kid, and Draco knows for a fact he\u2019s not as clever as his godfather, and there\u2019s no way he should be able to figure this riddle out, not if it\u2019s meant for a fully trained adult and not for a kid. But he does, even when he rereads it a couple times to make sure he\u2019s not going to accidentally poison them, he can\u2019t see how the answer can be anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s only enough for one,\u201d Harry says.</p>\n<p>Draco rolls his eyes. \u201cDo you think Professor Snape came down and refilled the vial between whoever is ahead of us and now? It\u2019s automatically replenishing, I\u2019m guessing. You go first, and I\u2019ll follow. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll go back and help Ron, but I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious that Harry is afraid, but he just gives one sharp nod before downing the potion and stepping forward through the flames.</p>\n<p>It takes several long, agonizing minutes for the potion bottle to refill itself, but as soon as it does Draco\u2019s knocking it back and following Harry through the wall of flames.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Quirrell is trying to strangle Harry but he\u2019s also possibly on fire and there\u2019s a face jutting out of the back of Quirrell\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>It seriously been like five minutes.</p>\n<p>He takes a page out of Neville\u2019s book and shouts, \u201cWingardium leviosa!\u201d He jerks his wand away from Harry and Quirrell goes flying, hitting the wall and then falling to the ground. He\u2019s still smoking. There\u2019s screaming still, which is kind of awful because his whole face is ash, and his body\u2019s sitting up in jerky, unnatural movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d He rushes for him and grabs him under his arms, hauling him upright. \u201cWe have to go! Now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake this,\u201d Harry says, and Draco feels him slip something into his front pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t let him have it. Go, I\u2019ll distract him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco is going to strangle him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you!\u201d He grabs Harry\u2019s hands and runs, except there\u2019s nowhere to run to, which isn\u2019t that just fantastic? Now they\u2019re standing in front of this weird ornate mirror, but when he glances at it he doesn\u2019t see his reflection. He sees the only thing he wants right now.</p>\n<p>He sees the hospital wing, Neville laid out in bed with Hermione and Madame Pomfrey on either side of him, except they\u2019re not looking at Neville, they\u2019re looking right at him, their faces pale with horror.</p>\n<p>It gives him an idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose your eyes and trust me,\u201d Draco orders. Thankfully Harry doesn\u2019t question him, and Draco really hopes this works otherwise he\u2019ll probably just end up knocking him out. He shoves Harry into the mirror, but he doesn\u2019t hit it, instead going through it and popping out the other side in the hospital wing. Whatever is left of Quirrell is shambling towards him, and he should follow Harry though, but instead he meets Madam Pomfrey\u2019s eyes and says, \u201cWe left Ron a couple rooms back, he needs help!\u201d</p>\n<p>Pomfrey doesn\u2019t ask for any more information, doesn\u2019t hesitate, instead she reaches out for him and Draco shoves his hand through the mirror, just enough to grab her wrist and pull her though.</p>\n<p>\u201cBehind me, Mister Malfoy,\u201d she says briskly.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t have to tell him twice. She\u2019s the scariest person at this school. If she can\u2019t handle the terrifying thing using Quirrell\u2019s body, then no one can.</p>\n<p>\u201cPomfrey,\u201d rasps a voice that\u2019s definitely not coming from the ashy remains of Quirrell\u2019s face. \u201cSo confident, to face me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shudders, but doesn\u2019t flinch, and raises her wand. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have attacked my children,\u201d she says fiercely. \u201cIncendio!\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of Quirrell\u2019s body burns.</p>\n<p>A screaming shadow comes racing towards them and she cuts her wand down in front them. \u201cDisperget!\u201d</p>\n<p>The shadow breaks apart, passing over them harmlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mister Weasley?\u201d Pomfrey asks sharply. \u201cThat\u2019s only temporary. We want to be gone by the time he reforms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d his throat is dry and he has to swallow twice before he can continue, \u201cthis way.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walk back through the potions room and the one with the unconscious troll and find Ron more awake than Draco had left him, still holding the icepack to his head. His face creases in alarm as soon as he sees them. \u201cIs Harry\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Draco says immediately. \u201cRight now we\u2019re more worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite right, Mister Malfoy,\u201d Pomfrey says.</p>\n<p>Ron slumps back in relief and actually smiles at him, the first real smile Draco\u2019s ever gotten from him. It\u2019s kind of brilliant, actually. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Even though Draco insists he\u2019s fine, she still makes him sit and wait to be checked over, which sucks because she makes Hermione go back to the dorm, and Draco would really, really like to go with her. Pomfrey had the philosopher\u2019s stone, no one had been permanently hurt, and he wants to go to bed. Harry and Ron, after the application of several healing charms, are fed some dreamless sleep so the rest of the healing can do it\u2019s work in peace.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it looks like you managed to get through this ridiculousness mostly unscathed,\u201d she says, wordlessly healing all his scrapes and bruises with quick, efficient flicks of his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this mean I can go back to my dorm now?\u201d he prods. All he really wants to do is sleep for a week, or at least until the start of the end of year feast, but he\u2019d rather do it in his own bed.</p>\n<p>She sighs, but runs another diagnostic spell over him and says begrudgingly, \u201cI suppose, if that\u2019s what you really want.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already pushing himself to his feet when the door to the hospital wing slams open and Severus hurries inside. \u201cPoppy, have you seen,\u201d he catches sight of Draco and freezes before snapping, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t hide behind Pomfrey, but only because he\u2019s pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t protect him. \u201cNo! I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d just released Mister Malfoy to go back to his dorm if you\u2019d like to accompany him,\u201d Pomfrey says dryly, looking at Severus with the same looks that\u2019s a mix of indulgent and unimpressed that she gives the students.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Severus says stiffly and then glares at him until he walks over to his side. \u201cThank you, Madame Pomfrey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco thinks it\u2019s pretty unfair that she stood in between him and Voldemort without flinching but she\u2019s perfectly willing to let his godfather murder him.</p>\n<p>As soon as the hospital wing door close behind them, Draco says, \u201cLook, I really didn\u2019t know about all that stuff, or the philosopher\u2019s stone or whatever. I thought the third floor corridor was forbidden like the forbidden section of the library, full of stuff we\u2019re not supposed to use or look at, but not anything inherently <em>dangerous</em>. I would have gone to you if I\u2019d known it was going to be all,\u201d he waves his hand, struggling to find the words, and settles on, \u201cridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d Severus sighs, and he sounds exhausted, more tired than he\u2019s ever heard him. He steps closer and he\u2019s expecting a slap upside the head or possibly for him to grab him by the shoulders to try and shake some sense into him. He\u2019s not expecting Severus to bend down and pull him to his chest, holding him until Draco hugs him back, throwing his arms around his godfather\u2019s neck and pressing his forehead into his shoulder. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, biting his lip to keep from crying, because what\u2019s the point of crying now? It\u2019s all over and everyone\u2019s fine, there\u2019s nothing worth crying about. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus lets him go but keeps a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI know. Just \u2013 don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning on it,\u201d he says instead of saying that he won\u2019t, because he gets the idea that if he starts hanging around Harry this kind of thing is just going to keep happening to him. \u201cYou know, this is two hugs in one year, that\u2019s kind of a lot for you. Are you doing okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrat,\u201d he says, but it comes out fond, and they resume their work towards Gryffindor tower.</p>\n<p>Draco almost lets the silence last, but he has too many unanswered questions. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he says, squeezing his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was all this about? Those challenges were too easy. They didn\u2019t keep us out, never mind Voldemort. What was the point?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus is quiet for a long moment, but when Draco looks up, he seems contemplative rather than upset. \u201cTell me about the challenges.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does, quickly outlining what the were and how they got past them.</p>\n<p>By the time he\u2019s done, Severus isn\u2019t contemplative anymore. He\u2019s furious. \u201cThose weren\u2019t the challenges we set up. Fluffy was as intended, you all got lucky with that one, but the devil\u2019s snare was meant to go straight for the throat. Whoever landed through shouldn\u2019t have had the time or the air to cast a lumos charm. It wasn\u2019t meant to suffocate, it was meant to snap the intruder\u2019s neck. The was no broom in the key room. The only way to get they key was to know the very specific incantation required to summon the correct key, or manage to fight off all the wrong keys that would by busy attacking the intruder, and they\u2019re sharp, Draco, they\u2019re only keys on one side. They\u2019re knives on the other. While Mister Weasley is very gifted, Professor McGonagall is a grandmaster chess player, and she designed that board. You\u2019re right, he never should have won. And I didn\u2019t leave any sort of juvenile riddle to go with my potions. If whoever was there didn\u2019t already know the correct bottle, they would have had to figure out the antidote based on smell alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>That gives him more questions than he answers. \u201cBut \u2013 why would someone make the challengers easier? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus doesn\u2019t say anything for a long moment, then, \u201cAre you and Mister Potter friends now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco wrinkles his nose and then shrugs. \u201cI think so? We\u2019re friendlier, at least. As long as he and Ron apologize to Neville. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I think he\u2019s going to need you by his side,\u201d he says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know to question things. You do.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason the way Severus says that makes a shiver go down his spine and he walks half a step closer. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not going to answer my question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says, as they stand in front of the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. \u201cBut you should keep questioning things anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good at that,\u201d he says, but interrupts himself midway with a yawn.</p>\n<p>Severus smiles and pushes him towards the portrait. \u201cGo to bed. I\u2019ll write your parents to them know you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, mangling it around another yawn. He gratefully walks to his dorm, ignoring the sun that\u2019s just beginning to peak over the horizon. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s asleep the moment his head hits the pillow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Harry and Ron do apologize to Neville the next day, who graciously accepts, and Hermione huffs at them and starts berating them for not researching everything more thoroughly, which thankfully they seem to understand means she forgives them too.</p>\n<p>Draco thinks they might all actually be friends now. Seamus and Dean just seem relieved the interhouse fighting is over.</p>\n<p>His Slytherin friends mob him the second they see him, demanding details about everything that happened last night, and he laughs and promises to tell them everything on the train ride home, but if he doesn\u2019t get back over to his table then the feast won\u2019t start.</p>\n<p>He sits in between Hermione and Neville with Ron and Harry across from them, and it feels good. It feels right.</p>\n<p>When Dumbledore starts awarding ridiculous, inflated points Draco just rolls his eyes. It\u2019s nice he doesn\u2019t want Gryffindor to feel so bad about being so badly behind everyone else, but as the numbers keep getting higher, everyone shifts uncomfortably in their seats. Surely he\u2019s not \u2013</p>\n<p>Draco sees red, and not just because all the green and silver banners have turned to red and gold. Some of the Gryffindors are happy but most just seem confused, the Ravenclaws are all looking down at their table, the Hufflepuffs are pissed, and the Slytherins \u2013 the Slytherins are devastated. Dumbledore starts clapping and everyone else follows suit, but very few people actually seem pleased about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d Draco hisses, louder than he\u2019d intended.</p>\n<p>Ron frowns and then says, \u201cYou know what, Draco? You\u2019re right.\u201d He gets up out of his seat and hurries down the table. He taps the twins on the shoulder then goes over to Percy.</p>\n<p>Fred and George glance at each other then follow their younger brother. The four brothers have a quick, whispered conversation and then Percy stands up, clears his throat, and says, \u201cHeadmaster Dumbledore, there are a few more last minute points to be tallied.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice easily cuts across the hall and everyone falls silent. He has to be using a sonorous to do that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so, Mister Weasley?\u201d Dumbledore asks, not sounding quite as warm as he had before.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Percy says, raising his chin. He turns to McGonagall, hesitates and then looks at Severus, before shaking his head and directing his attention to the space between them. \u201cProfessor Sprout. While their intentions were good, three students did go out after curfew. Being out after curfew is typically a fifteen point deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco knew that Percy was smart, but this is past smart and into brilliant. Sprout is the head of Hufflepuff. She can\u2019t let this whole farce stand. Or if she does, she\u2019s not worthy of her house.</p>\n<p>Sprout stares at Percy for a long, tense moment, then glances over at Dumbledore who\u2019s looking at her over his half moon glasses. Her mouth flattens into a frown and then she turns back to Percy and says, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely correct, Mister Weasley. Forty five points from Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough.</p>\n<p>Fred stands next to Percy and says cheerfully, \u201cMe and George are the ones that broke into your greenhouse and stole the dried mandrake root.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou-!\u201d Her eyes narrow. \u201cForty points from Gryffindor. And you\u2019ll be spending the first quarter of next year in detention growing me fresh mandrakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re the ones that let go of that dungbomb in the corridor outside of your class,\u201d George says, equally cheerful. \u201cSorry about all those fubberworms and daisies dying. We really didn\u2019t know that would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty points from Gryffindor,\u201d Sprout continues. \u201cAnd you can add harvesting flubberworms with Hagrid to your detention roster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco doesn\u2019t start cheering, but it\u2019s a near thing.</p>\n<p>Slytherin is in the lead again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sprout says, \u201cit seems we redecorated a bit preemptively.\u201d She takes her wand from her sleeve and waves it across the hall, the banners turning back into silver and green. \u201cIt seems as if Slytherin has won the house cup.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cheering from the whole hall is deafening.</p>\n<p>He takes back every uncomplimentary thing he\u2019s said about the Weasleys. It turns out that they\u2019re wonderful, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Hogwarts Express is cutting through the countryside and Draco is seated in a compartment with his favorite people, Pansy, Blaise, Daphne, Neville and Hermione all pressed together. He\u2019s just started telling everyone about the mess with the forbidden third floor corridor when there\u2019s a knock against their compartment door before it slides open. \u201cRoom for four more?\u201d Ron asks cheerfully. He\u2019s standing there Harry and the twins, all of them smiling at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe literally don\u2019t,\u201d he says, but he knows that he\u2019s smiling too.</p>\n<p>The twins scoff and George pulls out his wand. \u201cLook kids, I\u2019m going to teach you the wonderful art of expansion charms. There\u2019s more than enough room for all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>George ends up being sort of right, but even with Hermione and Blaise elbowing him from either side, Draco can\u2019t bring himself to mind.</p>\n<p>This year may have had its bumps, but well, it looks like he\u2019d made the right choice after all.</p>\n<p>It turns out being a Gryffindor isn\u2019t all bad.</p>\n<p>Except next year he really needs to focus on finding a quiet place to study. Of the many not-bad things about being a Gryffindor, the loud common room isn\u2019t among them.</p>"
