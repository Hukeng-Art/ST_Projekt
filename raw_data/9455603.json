  "text": "<p>based off of <a href=\"https://notbecauseofvictories.tumblr.com/post/59813337776/leupagus-jaaaaaaaaaackfrost-frostlands\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> tumblr post</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung had already had a pretty weird day. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His mother had called this morning and said she and Taehyung\u2019s dad were on their way to Hawaii for a three-week vacation, <em>just like that</em>, without even inviting their dearest son; at work Taehyung caught his boss snogging the new barista against a box of coffee beans, and then said boss <em>confessed</em> his love to Taehyung a few minutes later with tears streaming down his face. <em>Then</em> an old high school classmate had called and invited Taehyung to her <em>wedding</em>, and Taehyung had this brief existential crisis where he wondered how and when he reached the age where his friends were getting married. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So, really, being cornered into a dark alley by a vampire on his way back home from work was probably to be expected. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire was surprisingly gentle with pressing Taehyung into the brick wall, both of them hidden from view behind a large pile of trash. Taehyung stared into his startling red eyes and thought, <em>ah, so this is how it ends</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis has been a weird day,\u201d Taehyung blurted out. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire blinked, opening his mouth and licking over his protruding fangs. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI\u2019m just very thirsty. I promise I won\u2019t take much.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, uh, go ahead?\u201d Taehyung uttered, because honestly he had no idea what else to do in this situation. By all means, the vampire wasn\u2019t hurting him <em>yet</em>, but Taehyung didn\u2019t really want to test what happened if he tried to escape. Maybe the vampire wouldn\u2019t <em>kill</em> him if he didn\u2019t try to resist. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire nodded and surged forward, lips ghosting over the side of Taehyung\u2019s throat. \u2018<em>This is the most action I\u2019ve gotten in months,</em>\u2019 Taehyung thought briefly before the vampire actually bit him, and then he winced because it <em>really</em> fucking hurt. Young adult novels made this process seem a lot more sexy. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung through he was going to be stuck here for a while, sucked dry by this pretty attractive vampire, but then said vampire suddenly flew back as if he had been burned, and he <em>gagged </em>on the mouthful of blood in his mouth. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUh.\u201d Taehyung brought his hand up to his throat with a grimace; the wound on his neck stung. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d the vampire exclaimed, spitting out Taehyung\u2019s blood on the ground. Taehyung wasn\u2019t sure if he should feel offended, because it was obvious he didn\u2019t taste that good. On the other hand that might have saved his ass from a relatively freaky death. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with your blood? You taste <em>horrible</em>!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung brought his hand in front of him and stared at the blood coating his fingers in confusion. \u201cWell, I - I\u2019m anemic?\u201d Taehyung guessed, because that seemed like the most reasonable explanation. \u201cThat might be why. Never thought about this scenario happening before when I forgot to take my meds.\u201d Fainting, sure, that was always a scare if he forgot his iron supplements, but Taehyung never considered what a horrible meal it made him for thirsty vampires. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Not that he even <em>knew</em> about vampires, but that was another conversation entirely. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou should have <em>told</em> me that, <em>holy shit</em>!\u201d the vampire exclaimed. He rubbed his tongue with the palm of his hand, and the expression on his face was downright <em>pitiful</em>. \u201cThat\u2019s the <em>worst</em> blood I\u2019ve <em>ever </em>had, why the fuck don\u2019t you take anything to fix\u2026 whatever gross thing is happening in your body?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI - well I <em>forget</em> my iron supplements sometimes, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your business Mr. Vampire.\u201d Taehyung squinted through the darkness. \u201cSorry I taste like shit?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou should be sorry,\u201d the vampire grumbled, and it sounded like he was actually <em>sulking</em>. \u201cNow I need to find someone <em>else</em> to drink from and honestly it\u2019s such a hassle because you humans usually scream too much.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow,\u201d Taehyung stated, still not really grasping the situation. \u201cThough afterlife you got, buddy.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire glared, red eyes moving to Taehyung\u2019s neck. \u201cYou should wrap that up,\u201d he voiced. \u201cAnd take your fucking supplements.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung watched as the vampire dried his mouth with the fabric of his t-shirt (it was white - how inconvenient) and then stalked out of the narrow alley. Bringing his hand back to his neck, Taehyung stared after him, heart in his throat and wound throbbing, not sure what to do next. Was he supposed to just walk back to his empty apartment like this and forget it ever happened? Wasn\u2019t the vampire supposed to erase his memories or something, or at least have Taehyung swear to secrecy?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He kind of expected the vampire to return for him, maybe kill him. Hadn\u2019t Taehyung seen too much already? The vampire couldn\u2019t possibly think it would be wise to just <em>let Taehyung go</em>, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Honestly Taehyung wasn\u2019t even sure how he got himself home that night, but he remembered standing in front of his bathroom mirror and tending to the puncture marks on his skin. It didn\u2019t hurt that much now that the initial shock was over, but Taehyung still wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to process what had happened. A part of him wanted to believe what happened tonight was just some weird hallucination he was having due to stress, but the wound on his neck was too real. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><b><em>hey wheein do you believe in vampires</em></b>, taehyung messaged to his best friend after taking three pain-killers and bandaging up the wound on his neck in hopes he wouldn\u2019t bleed out on his sheets. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><b>what the fuck i was sleeping you useless paperclip</b>, wheein sent in reply. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">taehyung: <b><em>no I'm serious - do you believe in vampires?</em></b></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">wheein: <b>buffy isn\u2019t real taehyung</b></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>\u2018It\u2019s best to forget about what happened that night</em>,\u2019 Taehyung thought one week later, right before the same vampire appeared before him again in front of Taehyung\u2019s apartment complex. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He was wearing sunglasses and had an umbrella over his head to screen himself from the harsh<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>autumn sun, but Taehyung could easily recognize him. It wasn\u2019t every day you met and almost got drained dry by a vampire after all; the guy had left quite an impression. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung wondered what the hell he had done wrong in his past life to deserve this.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you taking your supplements?\u201d the vampire asked as Taehyung openly gaped at him, placing a protective hand over the mark on his neck that was still healing. He knew for a fact he certainly shouldn\u2019t talk to the person who had previously been trying to eat him, so Taehyung kept his mouth shut in defiance.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">What was one <em>supposed</em> to do in this situation? Run? Scream? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire frowned when Taehyung remained quiet. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell?\u201d the vampire pressed, voice harsh this time, and Taehyung flinched.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI - no, I forgot?\u201d he squeaked, looking around them with shaking eyes. They were on a pretty crowded street, right outside Taehyung\u2019s apartment block, and the vampire surely couldn\u2019t bite him <em>here</em>, but that didn\u2019t mean Taehyung wasn\u2019t cautious. Maybe if he screamed loud enough, the vampire would be scared at the commotion. \u201cLook - can you just leave me alone? I obviously taste horrible, I don\u2019t understand why -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung\u2019s speech got cut off as the vampire pulled a box of <em>iron supplements</em> out of his coat\u2019s pocket (he was wearing a lot more clothing today, covered from head to toe in jeans, a turtleneck sweater and even <em>gloves</em>) and handed it to Taehyung. \u201cHere, you should take this,\u201d he said seriously, and Taehyung didn\u2019t know what else he could do but comply. He had a similar box inside his apartment, but he forgot to take them too often. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you always care about your meals this much?\u201d Taehyung voiced, shaking the pill box. \u201cWhat does it matter? I mean - shouldn\u2019t you just kill me? Don\u2019t I know too much or anything?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was the vampire\u2019s turn to look confused. \u201cKill you?\u201d he voiced. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to kill you? I mean, I don\u2019t have to kill anyone to just drink a little blood, and us vampires have rules, too. I was just going to drink a little because my supplier was late, but I couldn\u2019t even have one <em>sip</em> of yours because you taste of fucking despair.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThanks,\u201d Taehyung stated. \u201cI\u2019ll take it as a compliment, since that means you can\u2019t drink from me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust - just listen,\u201d the vampire said hurriedly. \u201cJust take your fucking meds okay? I have this friend, too, he\u2019s really good with diets and could probably help you put up a dietary plan with high iron intake. You really should take care of yourself, you\u2019re disgusting.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Thanks</em>,\u201d Taehyung said again, furrowing his brows at the <em>showering compliments</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI mean - I mean your blood is,\u201d the vampire corrected himself, \u201cyour blood is disgusting. Your face is very attractive but that doesn\u2019t really help when you are rotting on the inside.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung snorted. \u201cSays the guy who is <em>actually dead</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire sighed, and Taehyung stepped back when he moved forward and put a gloved hand on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder, as if <em>comforting</em> him. \u201cListen,\u201d he started, slowly pulling his sunglasses down to show off his startling red eyes. \u201cI put on 100 SPF sunscreen to come give you this. I will check up on you in one week, and if you\u2019re not taking them regularly by then I will actually kill you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung gulped. \u201cA-are you allowed to do that?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo,\u201d the vampire said after a pause, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be mad. And I <em>bite</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Slouching a little, Taehyung gripped the iron supplements tighter in his hand as the vampire stepped out of his space with a slightly forced smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t move to the city to get a bloodsucking babysitter,\u201d Taehyung found himself saying, and the vampire shrugged his shoulders. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTough luck. You should have taken your supplements from the beginning and this would never have happened.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung grimaced at that. The anemia might have saved him the first time, but it also made the vampire <em>return</em>. And in the <em>weirdest</em> way possible. He couldn\u2019t believe a vampire was nagging at him to take his pills, even his <em>mother</em> didn\u2019t bother him much about that anymore. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, right,\u201d the vampire said as he was backing away, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cKim Taehyung,\u201d Taehyung said, and then immediately regretted it. \u201cShit, why did I tell you that?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCommon curtesy, Taehyung-ssi,\u201d the vampire scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m Jeon Jeongguk. See you in a week.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung shouldn't have been surprised when Jeon Jeongguk the vampire showed up outside the cafe he worked at exactly one week later. It was dark out, so he was wearing a white t-shirt and ripped jeans, and if it wasn\u2019t for his blood-red eyes Taehyung could mistake him for a normal-looking teenager. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">One that previously tried to drink Taehyung\u2019s blood, of course. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI should not have underestimated you,\u201d Taehyung said, frowning as Jeongguk shoved his hands in his pockets. It was very cold outside, autumn biting at your cheeks, but Taehyung supposed vampires had no sense of temperature. Jeongguk\u2019s bare arms did not seem particularly affected by the cold wind. \u201cOf course you would show up again, you stalker.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you,\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding insulted. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for you, and whatever stuff is flooding through your veins is obviously not it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung narrowed his eyes at the vampire, shifting on his feet. \u201cYou just want me to taste good.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat, too,\u201d Jeongguk admitted casually. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCreep.\u201d Taehyung slipped past the vampire and started walking in the direction of his apartment. It was quite a long walk, and Taehyung didn\u2019t take the bus because the bus cost <em>money, and so did the subway.</em> Not unexpectedly (but certainly unwanted) Jeongguk the vampire followed him; he walked close to Taehyung, a mere step behind him and saying nothing, yet his presence was clear as day. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung turned his head, a little put off by Jeongguk\u2019s silence. \u201cExactly what do you think you are doing?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk blinked. \u201cFollowing you home.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d Taehyung stopped, and so did Jeongguk, but he also bumped slightly into Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. They were about the same height, but Taehyung didn\u2019t doubt Jeongguk was a lot stronger than him, being <em>supernatural </em>and all that. Basically he had no chance actually trying to escape from this overbearing bloodsucker. \u201cAre you following me so you can drink me dry in my own home?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Jeongguk stated. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can just climb through your window and attack you while you sleep. You need to invite me inside.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung stored that information away to the back of his head for later use. He was safe in his own house, which meant Jeongguk couldn\u2019t reach him if he just decided to stay inside. Maybe he should just <em>hibernate </em>until the vampire grew tired of him<em>. </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess you don\u2019t sparkle, either?\u201d Taehyung guessed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI burn. It hurts like hell, but it\u2019s not necessarily lethal.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung nodded. So Jeongguk was a pretty traditional vampire, then, not the kind that appeared in bad fiction. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked, curiously, because honestly, if Taehyung was going to be followed around like this he deserved to know some vampire trivia. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTwenty.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow long have you been twenty?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Jeongguk groaned in distaste at the reference. \u201cI\u2019m twenty. I turned nineteen a little under a year ago, five days before I was made into a vampire. I\u2019m very new at this.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Taehyung stated, looking him up and down. \u201cThat\u2019s so lame, what the fuck. You\u2019re a vampire and I\u2019m still <em>older</em> than you? Holy shit you are possibly the worst vampire I could have befriended?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI will bite you,\u201d Jeongguk threatened, fake smile on his lips. His skin was very pale - though it didn\u2019t look unhealthy - but his lips were cherry red, like they were stained with blood. Taehyung wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were. His fangs weren\u2019t really visible now, a lot smaller than Taehyung remembered them to be. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung brought his hand to his neck where Jeongguk had bitten him last, taking a tentative step away from the vampire. \u201cYou\u2019re not biting me again,\u201d he said, attempting to sound a lot more confident than he actually was. Jeongguk may be <em>younger</em> than him (that was still weird, Taehyung first thought he was <em>ancient</em>) but he was also a <em>supernatural being</em> and honestly Taehyung didn\u2019t know exactly the extent of Jeongguk\u2019s powers just yet. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m going to bite you to check if you have been taking your supplements,\u201d Jeongguk said. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo. No, you\u2019re not. I promise I will be taking my pills but you are not biting me.\u201d He frowned at the look Jeongguk gave him. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk enough for you to do that again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to bite you when you are <em>drunk</em>,\u201d Jeongguk said, as if the notion offended him. \u201cI prefer my food relatively conscious.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung gaped at his words. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even go around biting people without their consent, you stupid bloodsucker!\u201d he hissed. Jeongguk brought his hand to his chest dramatically at the insult. \u201cYou said you have a supplier or whatever so it\u2019s not like you <em>need</em> me - if you want to bite me so badly you should at least take me on a date first!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung honestly meant the last thing as a joke, but Jeongguk looked like he considered it as soon as the words left Taehyung\u2019s mouth. \u201cA date?\u201d Jeongguk looked him up and down, and Taehyung suddenly felt very naked under his gaze. Vampires didn\u2019t have x-ray vision, right? \u201cWell, sure, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was joking.\u201d Taehyung turned around, and the worst part was that he could feel his ears redden; Jeongguk was in front of him within a split second, having probably used vampire super-speed or something to cut him off. Taehyung grimaced at the smug look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m not dating a fetus vampire just so he can check if I\u2019m taking my iron supplements.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk smiled. It still looked fake. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up in front of your place some time next week. Do you have work on Saturdays?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung spluttered. \u201cN-no, but -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGreat, see you then. Remember your pills.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung almost forgot about the date. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His week had been hectic, between late shifts and morning classes, and honestly Taehyung was too worn out to think about <em>vampires</em>. He had planned to just sit inside and watch reruns of dramas for the evening, maybe tell Wheein to come over with some ice cream, but then he went to take out the trash and saw a very familiar vampire standing outside his apartment complex\u2019 door. Jeongguk was wearing a nice pair of jeans and a white shirt - honestly, Taehyung thought white was a very unfortunate color to wear for someone who drank blood - his eyes a darker shade of red than the last time they had seen each other. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s eyes trailed over Taehyung\u2019s appearance as he exited the building, gazing over his pajama pants and torn shirt, eyes eventually stopping at the bag of trash in his hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLove your purse,\u201d Jeongguk said, sarcasm dripping from his voice, \u201cis it the new fall collection?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck off,\u201d Taehyung groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll just - I\u2019ll be right back, I just need to change. Do you want to come inside?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">One second, and Taehyung realized his mistake. The shit-eating grin that spread across Jeongguk\u2019s face was infuriating, and Taehyung wondered how many sins he had committed in his past life to deserve this. He had not intended to invite the vampire inside, but his mother had raised him to be a polite boy, and he hadn\u2019t thought things through. Being nice was just a natural thing to Taehyung, and now it got him in a very sticky situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <em>Shit. </em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDamn it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk snorted. \u201cHow do you fuck up that badly?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s my speciality,\u201d Taehyung deadpanned, screaming on the inside. \u201cJust stay here, okay? Be a nice <em>bloodsucker</em> and don\u2019t come inside my apartment just because you <em>can</em> now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou invited me inside,\u201d Jeongguk reminded him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m withdrawing that invitation.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t work like that, Kim Taehyung.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung <em>knew</em> that. He had been exposed to enough vampire media and was more than unhappy about the outcome of his own stupidity, because he should know better. He should never let his guard down around Jeon Jeongguk. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust - stay here.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged his shoulders and said he would wait, said he <em>wasn\u2019t going anywhere</em>, but also made sure to tell Taehyung he was a very impatient person. Taehyung resisted the urge to flip the vampire off as he threw his trash bag in the bin and then ran back up into his apartment. Sure, if Taehyung had been a smart person he could have just <em>stayed home</em> and refused to come out again, but now he had invited Jeongguk, a vampire, inside his apartment complex. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>I Was Too Polite And Accidentally Invited A Vampire Into My Home, </em>an autobiography by Kim Taehyung. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Not that Taehyung actually thought Jeongguk would <em>hurt </em>him. The vampire was weird and oddly devoted to taking care of his meals, but Taehyung was usually a good judge of character and nothing about Jeongguk said he was actually <em>dangerous</em>. Sure, Taehyung knew he should be a little cautious, but mostly because he had no idea <em>when</em> Jeongguk was actually planning on drinking his blood. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It hadn\u2019t been pleasant the first time, so Taehyung assumed it wouldn\u2019t be the next time, either, but he was slowly coming to terms with the fact that the vampire was <em>not</em> going to give up. The sooner Taehyung accepted his incoming fate, the better.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung threw on something decent that was in the clean part of his closet; a nice yellow sweater and a pair of wide-legged pants. It would do, because Taehyung wasn\u2019t <em>dolling up</em> for some lackluster vampire, especially not one that was trying to drink his blood. His hair was decent, he smelled nice, and he wore his <em>nice</em> Converse, even. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Before exiting his apartment, he left a small post-it note on his coffee table, just in case Jeongguk actually decided to kill him; Wheein had a spare key to his flat and at least she would find out why Taehyung was gone. Of all people she deserved to know, though knowing her she would find some way to resurrect him and then kill him again for being so <em>stupid</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Taehyung announced as he closed the door to his building shut. It didn\u2019t look like Jeongguk had moved an inch from his original position, feet planted on the ground and looking oddly <em>normal </em>where he was scrolling through his phone under the light of a lamppost. The vampire looked up and even gave Taehyung a tiny <em>smile</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you taking me somewhere dark and deserted to dispose of my body?\u201d Taehyung asked when approaching the vampire. He shrugged on the grey coat he had brought with him, because contrary to Jeongguk\u2019s clothing choices, it was freezing outside. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Jeongguk snorted, shoving his phone in his pocket, \u201cI\u2019ll buy you dinner first.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung narrowed his eyes suspiciously. \u201cReally?\u201d he drawled, crossing his arms in front of his chest in defiance. Jeongguk lifted one, unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy me dinner?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah?\u201d Jeongguk shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung wasn\u2019t buying it. The vampire was too insistent, like taking care of Taehyung <em>actually</em> mattered to him. Like this was <em>actually</em> a date. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you bite me just because you\u2019re buying me food,\u201d he stated. \u201cI\u2019m not that easy.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFigured as much. Let\u2019s go somewhere we can both enjoy ourselves, then.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk motioned for Taehyung to follow him, and Taehyung hesitatingly did as he was told. The streets were buzzing with college students escaping their dorms for a night out, and to anyone else it might look like Jeongguk and Taehyung were just on their way to a party, too. Colored contacts were in anyway, maybe people just thought Jeongguk had a very peculiar sense of fashion; no one really gave them a second glance.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat is this\u2026 <em>place</em> you\u2019re taking me to?\u201d Taehyung tryingly asked when they had walked a while in silence, Taehyung always making sure to be a small step behind the vampire so he wouldn\u2019t lose<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>sight of him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA bar,\u201d Jeongguk replied. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, they sell human food too.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Too</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung grimaced. \u201cIs it like\u2026 a <em>vampire bar</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cKind of,\u201d Jeongguk shrugged. \u201cThe people who own it are blood suppliers, so they run a sort-of establishment where they make drinks suitable for vampires as well. It\u2019s a <em>no human feeding policy</em> there, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me biting your neck on the dance floor or anything.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy would I want to dance with your dead ass?\u201d Taehyung scoffed. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m a good dancer?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He hadn\u2019t exactly expected that answer. Giving the vampire a quick once-over, Taehyung tried to imagine Jeongguk dancing under blinking lights in a club, but honestly he couldn\u2019t really see it happening. \u201cAlright, whatever you say. I\u2019m still not going to dance with you,\u201d Taehyung decided, looking away when he realized he might have been staring a little too long. \u201cSo - are the people who own this place vampires?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shook his head. \u201cNah, that wouldn\u2019t be a very good establishment, I think. They\u2019re human. Mostly.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow does that work?\u201d Taehyung asked, honestly curious. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you vampires easily be able to steal from them, or whatever? Kill them, even? And what do you mean <em>mostly</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Leading Taehyung down from the main street towards a cafe-district, Jeongguk started explaining. \u201cMost vampires respect these guys, because they get them cheap blood and give them a place to hang out, so they don\u2019t dare to do anything in the bar. Having a supplier is the best way to survive in the modern world as a vampire. It was different before, but vampires have evolved a lot, too, you know?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The streets were pretty quiet in this area, but Taehyung still thought it was weird how openly Jeongguk could talk about things that were supposedly <em>fiction</em> without being cautious. \u201cHow is it now, then? Compared to the stories I\u2019ve heard in books?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll explain more when we get inside,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there, but let us sit down before I give you a whole vampire lecture.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Shrugging, Taehyung only followed as Jeongguk led him towards a set of steep stairs he might as well have missed if they hadn\u2019t been pointed out to him. They led to what looked like a basement apartment, guarded by a blonde girl with reddish brown, kind-looking eyes; the sign above the door behind her read \u2018Bar Soleil\u2019 and Taehyung wondered if all vampires had a very ironic sense of humor. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey, Momo,\u201d Jeongguk greeted the girl by the door, lifting his hand to give a short wave as they walked town the narrow steps. She smiled in return, looking over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder to give Taehyung a once-over. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHello,\u201d she said, softly, a small smile forming on her lips. \u201cIs this your friend? He smells nice.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung gulped, and wondered how fast Jeongguk would catch up with him if he started running now. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk stated, and Taehyung could practically hear the disgust in his voice. \u201cThe taste is a total disappointment though. He\u2019s anemic.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh.\u201d Momo scrunched her nose up. \u201cEw.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre Yoongi and Jimin in?\u201d Jeongguk asked when Momo moved to open the door for them. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust Jimin,\u201d Momo said, sending a short, kind smile when Taehyung passed by her as quickly as possible. \u201cHave fun, you two.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung <em>did</em> doubt he would have any sort of fun surrounded by vampires who apparently thought he <em>smelled nice</em>, but he gave her an attempt of a polite smile in return, though he expected it looked pretty forced. Jeongguk waved him inside the bar, and Momo closed the door behind them. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The bar wasn\u2019t as dark and dungeon-like as Taehyung expected. It had grey brick walls and floors, vines and fairy lights hanging from the roof, booths and tables in dark wood and soft r&amp;b (Taehyung supposed Zion T. was a vampire favorite) was playing over the speakers. Taehyung admitted it had a nice mood, though he usually was more fond of the fast pace of clubs than quiet bars. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s go to the bar,\u201d Jeongguk said, pulling Taehyung gently by the upper arm. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a drink, and you can order some food, too.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Taehyung voiced, a little distracted at the sight of two burly vampires arguing over a heated game of Uno in a booth close to them. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Behind the intricately carved bar stood a rather short guy with silver hair; he was mixing up some metallic blue concoction for the girl sitting in front of him, and Taehyung swore her skin glittered a little under the dim fairy lights. She turned her head a little, and Taehyung stared in fascination at the glowing rhinestones embedded into her cheeks; her eyes were completely pink, with no pupil or whites. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe\u2019s a faerie,\u201d Jeongguk helpfully said when he noticed Taehyung\u2019s questioning gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to her, she might be able to play you into some century-long slave contract. Faeries are tricky bastards.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung was just surprised there were <em>more</em> things than vampires. Honestly vampires were enough excitement for him, he didn\u2019t need <em>faeries</em> on his list of New Things To Be Terrified Of. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say this is a vampire bar? Are faeries allowed here, too?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen one here before.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe\u2019s family, Jeonggukie,\u201d the silver-haired guy behind the bar said when Taehyung hopped onto a bar stool, as if he had heard their entire conversation. He looked too young to be running a bar, much less one that dealt with bloodthirsty vampires on a daily basis. He looked like he should be sitting next to Taehyung in college. \u201cMy sister-in-law.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe\u2019s Yoongi-hyung\u2019s sister?\u201d Jeongguk asked. Taehyung had no idea what was going on, simply looking between Jeongguk, the bartender and the faerie with interest. \u201cThey look nothing alike.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHalf-sister,\u201d the faerie answered, voice smooth. \u201cOn the good side, obviously.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The bartender rolled his eyes lightly at her reply and slid the glowing blue drink towards her. \u201cHere you go, Hani,\u201d he said, grinning when she gave a small, appreciative nod. \u201cNow, Jeongguk - what can I get you and your\u2026\u201d the bartended paused, looking Taehyung up and down, \u201chot date?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin-hyung,\u201d Jeongguk said, clearing his throat, \u201cthis is Kim Taehyung. Taehyung, this is Park Jimin. He owns the place.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh,\u201d Jimin said in realization, \u201cyou\u2019re the anemic kid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Turning his head towards Jeongguk, Taehyung gave the vampire his best deadly glare, in hopes that Jeongguk\u2019s already dead body would decompose. \u201cYou talk about me a lot, you creep?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA little,\u201d Jeongguk huffed, but he looked a little embarrassed, almost. \u201cI asked what you needed if you were anemic. Jimin-hyung bought the iron supplements.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung clicked his tongue, turning slowly back toward Park Jimin. \u201cGive me one tequila sunrise, please.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Ouch</em>, Taehyung.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">After looking through the menu Taehyung also ordered himself some fried chicken - they didn\u2019t have <em>garlic chicken</em>, oddly enough, which was a shame because it\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s favorite - Jimin mixed a Tequila Sunrise for Taehyung and a <em>Bloody Mary</em> for Jeongguk. The look Jimin sent Taehyung across the bar told him he should not try to have a small sip of Jeongguk\u2019s drink, even if it was just to taste, and Taehyung realized there might be some <em>actual</em> blood in it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A part of Taehyung really wanted to know what sort of odd ingredients Jimin had to work with behind the bar, when his customers were vampires and faeries and God knows what else. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeongguk said after they had finished half of their drinks and Taehyung was ripping through his first chicken leg. \u201cHit me with the questions. I\u2019m sure you have a lot of them.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Truth was, Taehyung didn\u2019t really know how to start. \u201cUh,\u201d he uttered, taking a tentative bite of his food. He had a lot of questions on the way here, but now he couldn\u2019t even think of a single one. \u201cI - uh - you said I smell nice?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <em>Great job Kim Taehyung. You go Kim Taehyung. </em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. That was why I tried to drink from you to begin with, because you smelled really good. I\u2019m surprised no other vampire has ever tried to drink from you before, especially since Momo said the same thing.\u201d Jeongguk grimaced lightly. \u201cToo bad your smell is false advertising for the real deal.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung groaned. \u201cFuck off. I am taking my supplements now, almost regularly.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"Almost,\" Jeongguk repeated, mockingly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"Listen, you,\" Taehyung grunted, pointing an accusing finger in the vampire's direction, \"old habits die hard. I'm generally very bad at remembering stuff like that, and I have been doing very well these past weeks. Don't you dare question me.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lifting his arms in defeat, Jeongguk let a small smile play on his lips, one that wasn't particularly scary but more adorable.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"So.\" Taehyung cleared his throat. \"Vampires. Faeries. Any other creatures I should be wary of when walking home in the dark?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk leaned a little back in his seat. \"Well, there are werewolves, but they're practically domesticated. They're good at taking care of newly shifted wolves and newborn vampires, though, so they usually handle that deal. There are witches, but they mostly make potions and do magic that hides and helps us supernatural folk rather than harm humans.\" Jeongguk looked like he was thinking. \"Merfolk. In the river. They're like faeries just in water, I advice you not to get involved.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. \"How can you guys even keep hidden?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"Most of us have old magic,\" Jeongguk said, sounding a little proud. \"Faeries just look like normal humans to most because of it, and magic makes us easy to miss in a crowd or easy to forget. I'm sure you've experienced that, with nearly forgetting me a few times?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung thought back, to how he had felt like he'd been busy the whole week with no time to think about anything supernatural. He didn't feel like there was any magic behind it, but that was probably the point. Jeongguk had been a small, vast memory that Taehyung only remembered briefly when seeing the wound on his neck, but he hadn't really dwelled on the topic of vampires a whole lot.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"I can always see you, though,\" Taehyung frowned. \"Your eyes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">At that, Jeongguk did look surprised. \"Really? They're always red to you?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung nodded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Before Taehyung could grasp the situation, Jeongguk cupped his face, and Taehyung let out a small squeal as Jeongguk carefully scrutinized his face. \"Does my magic not work on you?\" Jeongguk wondered, turning Taehyung's head a little. \"That's weird.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"M-maybe my anemia makes me immune,\" Taehyung tried to joke, but Jeongguk was too close for him to feel comfortable.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"Har har.\" Jeongguk let go of Taehyung's face and took a sip from his drink with a frown, red eyes narrowed into slits.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung rubbed his cheeks, feeling them heat up a little which was Very Unfortunate, and cleared his throat awkwardly. His fried chicken laid forgotten on the bar counter.\u00a0\u201cIs that why you walk around so easily? Because your magic makes you easy to miss?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. I was uneasy about it first, too,\u201d Jeongguk nodded, \u201cbut my Sire quickly assured me most humans wouldn\u2019t even notice if i stepped out right in front of them in broad daylight.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. \u201cYour <em>Sire</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe one who made me,\u201d Jeongguk explained simply. \u201cHe is a lot older and a lot more interesting than me, so if you actually want to know how the whole dynamics of vampires he\u2019s the one to ask, not me. The only reason I\u2019ve managed so well is because him and his mate have been taking good care of me after I was turned.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo\u2026 why did he turn you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk gave him a deadpan look. \u201cWhy do you <em>think</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Oh. Right</em>. \u201cAh. Sorry about your death?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. It was an accident, and Namjoon-hyung just happened to be at the right place at the right time.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cOr wrong place, I guess. Depends on how you look at it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow do you look at it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m okay with it. It\u2019s not the worst thing, being a vampire. There aren't really any hunters around anymore, and most of us are just\u2026 peaceful. No drama. Just immortality. Which might suck, in the long run, but I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d He slumped forward a little, picking at the rim of his glass. \u201cI\u2019m taking things as they come, at the moment. I\u2019m still Jeon Jeongguk, for now. Still alive. Sure, it\u2019s going to be a pain later, explaining to my parents why I\u2019m not getting any older but - it\u2019s better than them thinking I\u2019m dead. I think.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHm.\u201d Taehyung supposed it wasn\u2019t that bad. Sure, eventually everyone Jeongguk knew would die and he would still be the only one alive, but he supposed thinking too negatively when you were immortal was a bad thing as well. \u201cI guess it won\u2019t be too bad, you\u2019ll have a lot of time to learn new stuff. Do you sleep?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, sometimes,\u201d Jeongguk nodded. \u201cLike, if I haven\u2019t had anything to drink in a while I get tired quite easily. I take a lot of naps during the day. And during summer.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you do, then? As a vampire?\u201d Taehyung asked. \u201cI mean, beside stalking me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk looked just a little bit flustered. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>stalk</em> you, I keep tabs on you every now and then to check whether you\u2019re doing okay. You know; taking your meds, staying alive. That human bullshit.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou mean you watch over me so that you can eventually drink my blood, when I taste good enough?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBasically,\u201d Jeongguk admitted. Taehyung grimaced. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I follow you around everywhere or something, I have shit to do too. I have classes, and work. I mean - my whole undead life doesn\u2019t revolve around you, you\u2019re not that special. You just smell nice.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung blinked. \u201cAnti-climatic. I was expecting you to tell me you were in love with me or something.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCalm down there, Bella Swan.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">With a grimace, Taehyung aimed and kicked Jeongguk as hard as he could in the shin. It probably didn\u2019t hurt very much, because Jeongguk barely flinched. \u201cWhat did you <em>expect</em>, you overgrown <em>leech</em>. You\u2019ve been obsessed with me or something! Are you just going to leave me alone as soon as you\u2019ve had a bite of me or what?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s generally the plan, yes.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned, crossing his arms over his chest and turning up his nose. \u201cThen what\u2019s the point of telling me all of this? Why tell me about everything if you\u2019re just going to leave when all of this is over?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThought it would be better that way, honestly,\u201d Jeongguk said. \u201cI mean - I\u2019m not planning on dragging you into mingling with vampires and werewolves, but you already know we exist, so the best I can do is assure you we don\u2019t really hurt anyone. Most of us, anyway. I mean - there are always assholes, no matter what species, but Jimin usually handles those cases before humans get suspicious.\u201d He shrugged again, and Taehyung hated that he kind of made sense. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my shitty self-control to have you walking scared around Seoul for the rest of your life. I\u2019d feel guilty.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019d feel guilty,\u201d Taehyung repeated, deadpan expression on his face. \u201cYet you plan on drinking my blood.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYep.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFantastic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s eyes brightened, wide grin spreading across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2014\u201d he leaned close to Taehyung, so close his cherry red lips were nearly touching his ear, \u201c \u2014<em>fang</em>tastic.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 I hope you burn on a stake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein found Taehyung in the university library, nose buried between the pages of <em>Vampire Forensics: Uncovering the Origins of an Enduring Legend</em>. She bumped down next to him, brows raised to her hairline at the multiple titles of vampire literature scattered around the table. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat sort of kink have you gotten yourself into <em>now</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung briefly looked up from the passage he was reading to give Wheein a small look. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it involves biting,\u201d he voiced, and pulled down the collar of his turtleneck to show his best friend the bright pink scar forming on his neck. \u201cLike, lots of it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein\u2019s expression was a mix of disapproval and even more disapproval. \u201cAren\u2019t you about ten years too late to have a Twilight phase, Kim Taehyung?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe doesn\u2019t sparkle, I\u2019ve already discarded Twilight.\u201d Taehyung waved his hand absent-mindedly. \u201cJust nod along please, and pretend like you believe me. It makes everything about ten times easier for both of us.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFine,\u201d Wheein huffed. \u201cWho\u2019s <em>he</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung said, because at no point had Jeongguk asked him to keep <em>whatever they had</em> a secret. Hell, Jeongguk had willingly taken Taehyung out to answer all his questions about vampires and werewolves. \u201cHe\u2019s the vampire that bit me. He was going to drink my blood but apparently my anemia makes it taste like shit, so now he\u2019s made it his mission to \u2014\u201d Taehyung paused at Wheein\u2019s slack jawed expression, \u201c\u2014 he wants to drink my blood, is honestly all you need to know. He wants to drink my blood, I accidentally invited him into my house one time so now I\u2019m not even safe in my own home, and he\u2019s very attractive. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>What</em> part of that is <em>unfortunate </em>to you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung grimaced. \u201cAll of it, I guess.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein pulled a book titled <em>Vampires and Science</em> out of the large pile of literature on the table. \u201cOkay; I have no idea why you <em>would </em>be lying about this, so I\u2019m just going to assume this vampire obsession isn\u2019t caused by you having been high for the last three weeks. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s real \u2014\u201d she opened the book at a random page, \u201c\u2014 if so, you should probably stay at my place.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMh, probably,\u201d Taehyung agreed. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that he isn\u2019t going to leave me alone until he gets his teeth in me, but I\u2019d rather it didn\u2019t happen while I\u2019m sleeping in my own home.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe said he was going to leave you alone?\u201d Wheein asked. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung nodded. \u201cYep. Promised, even.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein snorted loudly. It was obvious she didn\u2019t believe a word Taehyung was saying, but she was at least kind enough to just go along with it. Taehyung really appreciated it. Wheein was great. Taehyung wondered if Jeongguk had a friend like her that he would have to leave behind eventually. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cApparently, many people think vampires pump blood with their skeletal muscle,\u201d Taehyung said, eyes scanning over the text in his book. He had been here for two hours already, just reading, even though it was stupid. He <em>knew</em> where Bar Soleil was, and could probably go there for more answers than these books could give him. \u201cDo you think that means they can get hard?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Wheein stated, furrowing her brows. \u201cIs it important? Do you plan on <em>banging</em> the vampire before he sucks you dry?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung shrank in his seat, cheeks growing warm. \u201c<em>I\u2019mjustcurious</em>,\u201d he mumbled unintelligibly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCurious if the vampire is good in the sack?\u201d Wheein questioned, looking far too amused. \u201cPlease sort you priorities, Kim Taehyung.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease lower your voice, Jung Wheein.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein sat back, looking smug, <em>Vampires and Science </em>resting on her knees. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just <em>text</em> the vampire and ask if he can get it up or not? Why you gotta pretend like you read serious literature for it if you can just sext him about it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t have his number,\u201d Taehyung mumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShame.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung slammed the book shut, staring intently at the dark paperback cover of it. He didn\u2019t know <em>why</em> he was just waiting for Jeongguk to pop up like he always did when he knew where to go to get answers. Sure, he wasn\u2019t certain just how safe it was to walk into a vampire bar while <em>not </em>accompanied by a another vampire, but Jeongguk had assured him they had a non-feeding policy there, right? Maybe the bartender \u2014 Jimin? \u2014 could answer more of Taehyung\u2019s questions. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked Wheein, who was now <em>actually</em> reading the book she had picked out of the pile. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAround 8 PM, why?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned, tapping his fingers against the table. \u201cVampires are awake at 8 PM, right? They should be?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein made a noncommittal should \u2014 <em>I guess</em> \u2014 and Taehyung rose to his feet, pulling his bag and jacket with him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Wheein asked. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTo get some answers.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHello, Taehyung!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Momo was standing outside Bar Soleil, friendly smile in place and red eyes glinting under the blinking sign above her. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey, Momo,\u201d Taehyung greeted, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cUhm \u2014 are you okay with me going inside? I was wondering if, uh, <em>Jimin</em> was in, maybe?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin\u2019s inside, so you\u2019re more than welcome! Are you taking your pills?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJeongguk told me you\u2019re taking medication to make your blood taste better!\u201d Momo chirped, cradling her hands under her chin and peering up at Taehyung, cutely. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you to do for him, Taehyung, I wish I had a human friend like that!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cYes. Friend. Great.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The bar looked the same at this hour \u2014 just a little bit more brightly lit \u2014 light pop playing over the speakers. There were no customers at the moment, but Jimin was still behind the bar, silver hair and golden skin unable to miss. Taehyung made his way over, awkwardly gaining the bartender\u2019s attention while loudly clearing his throat. \u201cH-hello, Jimin?\u201d he said, and Jimin looked up from where he was cleaning a fancy glass. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s face split into a grin. \u201cYeah, of course! Taehyung, right? Tequila sunrise!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI - it\u2019s Monday \u2014\u201d Taehyung started, but really, when had that ever stopped him before? \u201cYeah, uhh - one tequila sunrise, I guess.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGot\u2019cha!\u201d Jimin voiced, winking at him. \u201cNice of you to stop by, is Jeongguk not with you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHm? No - no, I just - I was bored. Decided to stop by to make sure I hadn\u2019t just\u2026 <em>imagined</em> this whole place up.\u201d Things shouldn\u2019t make sense, not logically, but Taehyung had the scar on his neck as proof of Jeongguk\u2019s <em>vampirism</em>. He\u2019d <em>seen</em> the faerie girl last Saturday, and she definitively wasn\u2019t human, so honestly Taehyung had no doubt in his mind Jeongguk was telling the truth about everything. He was just trying to figure out how he could think <em>less </em>about it. Whatever magic trick Jeongguk had pulled the first times to make Taehyung\u2019s mind drift off of everything that had to do with the supernatural didn\u2019t seem to be working anymore. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin finished making Taehyung\u2019s drink in record speed, and after sliding it over to Taehyung he pulled out a cold beer from underneath the counter and made himself comfortable on the opposite side of Taehyung. \u201cSo,\u201d Jimin said, eyes twinkling. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. I know you must have questions, and I\u2019m sure Jeonggukie didn\u2019t answer all of them.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung hesitated, because honestly he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he was most curious about. \u201cAre you\u2026 human?\u201d he eventually asked, not sure if it was rude or not. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYep,\u201d Jimin confirmed. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid all of this \u2014\u201d Taehyung gestured wildly around him, \u201csurprise you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, boy \u2014 Jeonggukie didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Jimin laughed, as if Taehyung had said something very funny. \u201cI <em>am </em>mortal, but I was born into this world. The supernatural one, that is. Except I was kind of born to kill vampires, not help them get their monthly blood supply.\u201d Taehyung felt his mouth drop, and Jimin giggled at his expression. \u201cI\u2019m a hunter. My family all are, anyway, and I\u2019m trained well and know exactly how to effectively eradicate bloodsuckers and mangy mutts, but \u2014\u201d he shrugged, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s not really needed. Supernaturals have been blending in with society for a long time, and the only ones I have to get rid of are the ones who turn rouge. And those are far and few in between.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow,\u201d Taehyung stuttered, not really knowing what more to say, \u201cI guess I feel kind of safe here, knowing that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t feel safe with Jeongguk?\u201d Jimin asked, amused. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. \u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Well, I know he wouldn\u2019t really hurt me, and I trust him on that, but I also know he only follows me around because he wants to drink my blood and stuff.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou sad about that?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Taehyung immediately protested, ears turning red. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. There\u2019s more to me than <em>blood bag</em>, you know. He only shows up like once every week to check if I\u2019ve taken my supplements, not really talking to me but still invading my private space, and now he\u2019s saying he\u2019s going to disappear as soon as my blood tastes good? I mean \u2014 that\u2019s kind of shitty of him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Very</em> shitty,\u201d Jimin agreed, lips curling into a sly smile. \u201cYou <em>like</em> him.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI \u00a0\u2014 I think so?\u201d Taehyung uttered, his face turning warmer by the second. \u201cI mean - we don\u2019t really know each other, apart from the whole thing with him courting me with unlimited iron supplements.\u201d He huffed, because honestly it was infuriating. Taehyung liked Jeongguk about equally as much as he was annoyed with him, which was a great deal. Jeongguk was <em>interesting</em>, and Taehyung at least wanted to know more about him before parting ways. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I actually like him or if he put some weird vampire spell on me, but him trying to drink my blood in that alley was the closest I\u2019ve been to a cute boy in like five months.\u201d Taehyung frowned at his own words. \u201cDoes that make me sound desperate?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust a little,\u201d Jimin assured him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about it. I\u2019m sure Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know you better \u2014 you just have to tell him you want to. The boy\u2019s dense, but I can tell he likes you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung could have guessed that, honestly. Why else would he be following Taehyung around with bullshit excuses. \u201cHow do I even get to that conversation, though?\u201d he wondered. \u201cLike \u2014 \u2018I know you\u2019re just in it to drink my blood but can we get to know each other first? Maybe make out?\u2019\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It looked like Jimin was about to reply, but then the entrance to the bar opened, another customer appearing for an early Monday drink. At least Taehyung supposed so, until he saw the shift in Jimin\u2019s expression; his face lit up like a fucking Christmas tree, eyes sparkling at the sight of the new arrival. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A pale guy with dusty pink hair and lazy, light-brown eyes approached the bar; he was carrying a large cardboard box without much difficulty, and Taehyung noticed how the guy\u2019s pierced ears were sharp \u2014 like an elf\u2019s \u2014 and his cheekbones dusted with glitter. Taehyung assumed he was a faerie from his appearance alone. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The faerie placed the box on the counter without acknowledging Taehyung, immediately greeting Jimin with a soft, barely-there smile. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, voice deeper and raspier than Taehyung had expected. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Hello nurse</em>,\u201d Jimin grinned cheekily, leaning across the counter to cup the pink-haired man\u2019s face and kiss his nose. \u201cHow was work?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHm,\u201d the man grunted, rolling his eyes lightly \u2014 probably at Jimin\u2019s <em>nurse</em> comment. Taehyung noticed that he was indeed wearing simple, blue scrubs under his thick coat. \u201cIt was okay. Boring. I got this week\u2019s supply, though, should be enough for all the orders we\u2019ve gotten in.\u201d He pulled Jimin in, pecked his mouth and both his cheeks; Taehyung felt like he was intruding on something very, very intimate. \u201cWho\u2019s the human? Friend of yours?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHis name\u2019s Taehyung,\u201d Jimin said, and Taehyung sat up a little straighter in his seat, locking eyes with the faerie. \u201cHe\u2019s Jeonggukie\u2019s friend.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The faerie looked genuinely surprised. \u201cJeongguk has friends?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin snorted at that comment. \u201cI guess he does, now. He brought Taehyung here last Saturday, when you were working your night shift. They\u2019re cute together.\u201d He smiled smugly as Taehyung felt his cheeks redden. \u201cThis is Yoongi, by the way. My <em>darling</em> boyfriend. He works as a nurse at Hanyang Medical Center.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh \u2014 <em>oh</em>, that\u2019s how you get the blood!\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, like it wasn\u2019t obvious. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yoongi lifted one eyebrow, sharing a small look with Jimin that Taehyung didn\u2019t know what meant. \u201cI\u2019ll go store these in the back, and then I\u2019ll go take a nap before the midnight hours set in,\u201d Yoongi said, pulling the box back into his arms. \u201cNice meeting you, Jeongguk\u2019s <em>friend</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung watched as Yoongi moved to the back of the bar, Jimin throwing a flying kiss after his back. \u201cIs he \u2014 he\u2019s a faerie, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHalf,\u201d Jimin corrected. \u201cHis mom\u2019s a faerie, but his dad was human. Needless to say, he\u2019s not the most popular at family reunions. For multiple reasons.\u201d Jimin shook his head, lightly. \u201cHe\u2019s significantly more human than his siblings, and faeries aren\u2019t exactly known for being\u2026 <em>pleasant</em>. They don\u2019t understand human emotion or compassion, and they can\u2019t lie, either. Their magic is old and tricky and can lure you into centuries of slave contracts without them <em>actually</em> telling you blatant lies. They\u2019re very persuasive bastards.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow. They sound\u2026 great?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin giggled, taking Taehyung\u2019s now-empty glass off the counter. Taehyung hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d finished it. \u201cAs I said, Yoongi is a lot more good-natured than the rest of his family. Though it was immensely difficult to court him, I\u2019ll admit.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened as Jimin reached over and lightly pinched his cheek. \u201cCompared to him, Jeongguk is a walk in the park. Vampires are simple. So don\u2019t worry your pretty little head around it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Somehow, Jimin\u2019s words of comfort did actually help. Sure, he wasn\u2019t as human as Taehyung had hoped, but it was enough to know he wasn\u2019t the only mortal in this weird, weird world. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have one more question,\u201d Taehyung said when he declined Jimin\u2019s offer of another tequila sunrise, <em>on the house</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAsk away.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Biting his bottom lip, Taehyung pulled his phone out of his coat pocket and \u2014 hesitatingly \u2014 handed it over to Jimin. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you happen to have Jeongguk\u2019s number?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[to: count draculame] </b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; hey can vampires get hard<br> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><br> <b>[from: count draculame] </b></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; ?????? who the fuck is this</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[to: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; who do you think do you seriously have any other friends</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; i went to bar soleil and got your number from jimin</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[from: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; \u2026. this is taehyung isn't it</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; you went to bar soleil to get my number</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; just so you can ask if vampires can have sex??</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[to: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; yeah</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; it was really eating me up, im very curious</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[from: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; ????????? of all things</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; we can, but,,,, why is that a thing you were curious about</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[to: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; idk i feel like it might come in handy in the future to know </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; whether or not you can get it up</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <b>[from: count draculame]</b> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; ???????????????</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; what do you mean</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; taEHYUNG??????</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; HELLO???</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou moved.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk was leaning against the entrance of Taehyung\u2019s university, blending effortlessly into the crowd with his ripped jeans and leather jacket. He looked so good Taehyung had to remind himself to breathe for a short second. Weak.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTemporarily,\u201d Taehyung corrected him, stopping in front of the vampire and shoving his hands in his pockets.

A shy lil\u2019 bean.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 how much did you talk with Jimin, exactly?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung only grinned in reply. Obviously, they hadn\u2019t talked too much during Taehyung\u2019s spontaneous visit to Bar Soleil, but Jimin had given Taehyung his own number as well as Jeongguk\u2019s and told him to text whenever he could. It turned out they had a lot in common, and Jimin was very easy to talk to, even over text. It was better to talk to him about inquiries regarding vampires rather than bugging Wheein too much \u2014 Taehyung could tell she was reaching the end of her patience now that the exams were right around the corner. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you \u2014 wanna go somewhere?\u201d Jeongguk asked, nervously shifting the weight on his feet. \u201cOn \u2014 uh \u2014 on a date?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung willed himself not to grin widely. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018my entire undead life doesn\u2019t revolve around you\u2019, hm?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk rolled his eyes, and Taehyung guessed that if vampires could blush, Jeongguk\u2019s face would be a little pink by now. According to Jimin Jeongguk <em>did</em> get easily flustered when people were obviously flirting with him (apparently it happened a lot at Bar Soleil) and Taehyung had decided to test it out. If Jeongguk was persistent on hanging around him for a while, Taehyung might as well make it fun and enjoyable for himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jeongguk said. \u201cBut it could revolve a <em>little</em> bit more around you, I guess. It wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow!\u201d Taehyung gasped dramatically. \u201cWhat character development!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShut up.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s voice had no real bite in it, a tiny smile playing on his lips. He grabbed Taehyung by the sleeve his sweater, pulling him along. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere you can eat. Anything you want?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung grinned. \u201cSomething with garlic?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Now</em> you\u2019re just being an asshole,\u201d Jeongguk snorted. \u201cIf you have nothing smart to say, let\u2019s just go to a caf\u00e9. I\u2019m craving coffee.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou drink coffee?\u201d Taehyung frowned. \u201cYou can still consume human shit?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk grimaced. \u201cNot yet \u2014 not food, at least. I can drink things like coffee, tea, soda; but I can\u2019t eat human food. It\u2019s going to take some time for me to teach my stomach to keep it down, apparently. But it is possible \u2014 I mean, my Sire\u2019s mate is a chef and everything. They go on dinner dates all the time.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd\u2026 How old are they?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Like\u2026 five-hundred?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you saying you won\u2019t be able to eat food in, like, hundreds of years?\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, gasping dramatically. \u201cWow. That\u2019s truly tragic.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, the worst part of it. But then again I\u2019m never actually hungry, either. Just thirsty for human blood and all that jazz.\u201d He shook his head, like it really wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, but Taehyung couldn\u2019t imagine going a whole year without the taste of barbecue or seafood. <em>Man</em>, that made him sad. \u201cStill - I can drink coffee, so let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s find someplace nice.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They ended up taking the subway to Insa-dong, to a caf\u00e9 that sold one liter iced americanos for 3000 won. \u201cWhy the fuck would I need one liter iced americano?\u201d Jeongguk argued, but he got one anyway, for them to share. Two straws any everything, real <em>romantic</em>. Taehyung tried not to think too much of it, because Jeongguk was still a vampire and he wasn\u2019t sure how wise it was to date one. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Taehyung said when they\u2019d found a nice spot inside the caf\u00e9, huddled into a corner and far enough away from prying eyes, \u201ctell me the best thing about being a vampire. Like \u2014 really sell it to me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSeriously?\u201d Jeongguk laughed. \u201cYou want me to sell you <em>vampirism</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cCome on. Lay it on me, convince me being a vampire is like, the <em>coolest</em> thing.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk grinned widely, showing off his weird mix of bunny-like front teeth and sharp fangs. \u201cWell \u2014 where do I start?\u201d He leaned back in his chair, and it looked like he was really thinking it through. \u201cOkay; all-nighters,\u201d he started, \u201call-nighters are like, no problem. You wont be tired as hell the next morning if you decide to stay up all night \u2014 or day, in my case \u2014 watching anime. When I was still a fledgling \u2014 a newborn, I guess \u2014 Namjoon didn\u2019t allow me out of his apartment. I basically just spent two weeks marathoning One Piece and drinking out of blood bags.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung nodded, taking a long sip of his coffee. \u201cVampirism equals more anime \u2014 got it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m sure it will also help me during exam season,\u201d Jeongguk added, \u201cwhich reminds me \u2014 I now have <em>time</em> to learn all the shit I want. Like, I can finish my business degree first since my parents want me to, but then I can do art like <em>I</em> want to, because I have time and Namjoon and Seokjin are backing me financially. Also living forever means at some point you\u2019re gonna earn lots of money. At least Namjoon is, like, <em>filthy</em> rich.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, \u201call the main leads in dramas who are supernatural \u2014 My Love From The Stars, Goblin; they\u2019re all rich, right? So I guess it\u2019s an immortal thing. Do you guys live in, like, a castle or something? A really big mansion?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, we live in Gangnam.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh.\u201d Taehyung deflated. \u201cA castle would have been cool. If I was a vampire I\u2019d have a castle.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shrugged, lightly, leaning forward to take a sip of their gigantic coffee. It was a little watery, and definitively not the best coffee Taehyung had, but he didn\u2019t really care. He didn\u2019t come out for the coffee anyway. \u201cI think Namjoon-hyung and Seokjin-hyung lived in a castle before, but they said something about it being a bother to maintain,\u201d Jeongguk explained. \u201cI can understand that, you know. 500 years of household chores probably does something to you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuh. I guess that\u2019s true.\u201d Taehyung rested his head in his hands, watching Jeongguk as he took another sip of their shared coffee. Their eyes met, and for a second Taehyung thought, <em>wow, he\u2019s really fucking handsome</em>, before the vampire looked away. \u201cAnything else?\u201d Taehyung asked, just to keep the conversation going. It was already painfully obvious Jeon Jeongguk the vampire was attractive, and even more obvious that Taehyung was stupidly attracted to him. That didn\u2019t mean Taehyung needed to <em>think</em> about it at all times. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell \u2014 it\u2019s quite fun showing up at the gym and lifting as much as those really muscular bodybuilding bros. You know, seeing their surprised faces fills me with joy.\u201d Jeongguk sighed. \u201cOther than that \u2014 well, there are a lot of small things. I don\u2019t get tired as quickly, got more energy to do the shit I want. Did I tell you I teach dance classes?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung blinked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The most Jeongguk had said about dancing was that he was <em>supposedly good at it</em>, but Taehyung had heard that from guys in the club right before they brought out the <em>whip</em> and <em>naenae</em>. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were <em>that</em> good of a dancer? Do you teach, like, kids?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cElementary kids, middle schoolers. The other instructor is a werewolf, so \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJesus Christ, those poor kids!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was very noticeable, the way Jeongguk <em>flinched</em>, shoulders rising and face twisting into an uncomfortable grimace. \u201cAh,\u201d he uttered, \u201cp-please don\u2019t say that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung said, honestly surprised at Jeongguk\u2019s behavior. \u201cSay what? Jesus Christ?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He flinched again, and Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh shit \u2014 is that a <em>thing</em>? Like \u2014 the name of God can actually hurt you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot <em>actually</em> hurt us,\u201d Jeongguk mumbled. \u201cCrucifixes can, but hearing\u2026 <em>the name</em> \u2014 it kind of just makes us very uncomfortable and a little bit nauseous. We can\u2019t say it, either.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuh,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cI guess we know what our safe word is.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung mimicked, feigning an innocent smile. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s cheeks puffed up in a manner that certainly did not scream \u201cbloodthirsty vampire\u201d. He looked annoyed. \u201c<em>Taehyung</em>,\u201d he seethed, lips curling over his fangs. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2026 <em>say</em> that and expect me not to ask questions! And \u2014 and you need to explain what you meant with that text, too!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung tilted his head to the side. \u201cWhat text?\u201d he asked, trying his best not to laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was fun watching Jeongguk so frustrated. Taehyung felt a smile creeping onto his lips, because he could only imagine how much the vampire would be blushing if it was physically possible \u2014 </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was faint, but Taehyung could see the <em>slight</em> hint of a pinkish hue on Jeongguk\u2019s cheeks. He gaped, stood up in surprise, and leaned over their small table to cup Jeongguk\u2019s cheeks. His skin was cold, but not <em>dead-</em>cold, more \u2018<em>I\u2019ve been outside for a few hours in the snow\u2019</em>-cold. \u201c<em>Woah</em>!\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, pinching Jeongguk\u2019s skin. Jeongguk made no apparent move to resist Taehyung\u2019s ministrations, merely sat there with wide eyes as the human examined his face. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing! You can blush?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cO-obviously,\u201d Jeongguk said after a short silence, hands coming up to grab Taehyung\u2019s wrists \u2014 he pried Taehyung\u2019s fingers off his face. \u201cIf my blood can rush to my dick it can also rush to my face, you <em>idiot</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That made sense, obviously, but Taehyung had never thought of it. Before he could realize what he was doing, Taehyung\u2019s eyes dropped to Jeongguk\u2019s crotch area. \u201cOh, right,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Taehyung looked back up, Jeongguk was staring at him, red eyes gleaming. He was still holding onto Taehyung\u2019s hands, and suddenly Taehyung felt a little vulnerable, realizing how <em>easy</em> it would be for Jeongguk to actually hurt him. Jeongguk seemed to be staring at his neck, and Taehyung gulped audibly. \u201cYou're taking your pills, right?\u201d Jeongguk suddenly said, licking his lips, and then \u2014 before Taehyung could even think of a reply \u2014 he was leaning in.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Oh shit. Shit</em>. <em>He\u2019s going to bite me\u2014</em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJeongguk \u2014!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk did not bite him. Instead, the vampire pressed his lips softly against Taehyung\u2019s, so gently Taehyung might have mistaken it for an accident. It obviously wasn\u2019t, however, since Jeongguk did it again, and <em>again</em>, and Taehyung slowly but surely felt his eyes slide close, enjoying the gentle press of Jeongguk\u2019s lips against his own. It was just kisses, and they were in public, but despite that it filled Taehyung with <em>warmth</em>. Which was <em>weird</em> considering Jeongguk\u2019s lips were a little cold and chapped. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Public</em>,\u201d Taehyung managed to say, voice uncharacteristically weak, \u201cwe\u2019re in public, Jeongguk.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk barely moved away, face still impossibly close and red eyes focused on Taehyung\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019d rather we go somewhere private?\u201d he asked. \u201cMoving fast there, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cY-you\u2019re the one who kissed me out of nowhere!\u201d Taehyung spluttered, face probably a matching hue with Jeongguk\u2019s eyes at this point. \u201cI thought you were going to bite me and suck me dry in the middle of this coffee shop! Then I\u2019d never \u2014 I\u2019d never, you know, see you again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Jeongguk's eyes widened.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Ah, shit</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou \u2014 you wanna see me more?\u201d he asked\u00a0asked, brows furrowing. \u201cL-like this?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, you fucking idiot,\u201d Taehyung said, rolling his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t even know <em>why</em>, but I want to see you again. I don\u2019t want you to just keep tabs on my medicine intake and drink my blood and then leave like you said you would. I wanna get to know you. And maybe \u2014 and maybe kiss you more. Like this.\u201d Taehyung licked his lips and closed the distance between them again, placing a small kiss to the corner of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth. \u201cT-that\u2019s okay, right? There aren't any special dating rules between vampires and humans?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk shook his head, quickly, adorable smile on his face. <em>Shit</em>, he was so <em>cute</em>. \u201cSo \u2014 you want to go on another date with me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung sighed. \u201cYes. <em>Yes</em> I want to go on another date with you, Jeongguk. You\u2019re oddly charming.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at the still-grinning vampire. \u201cIt\u2019s not some weird old magic you\u2019re working on me, is it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNah, I\u2019m just that great,\u201d Jeongguk bragged. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable, that you\u2019d want some of this <em>sexy vampire sugar</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung snorted, pushing Jeongguk\u2019s head back with his index finger. \u201cYeah, keep telling yourself that, little <em>leech</em>.\u201d Still, he couldn\u2019t help but beam at how <em>happy</em> Jeongguk looked, nose all scrunched up from how much he was smiling. The part of Taehyung that had seen too many vampire shows and read too much fiction warned him this was a horrible idea, that he would get his heart torn to shreds both figuratively and literally. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The bigger part of him really just wanted to bone the hot vampire. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Priorities</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else,\u201d Taehyung said, immediately standing up from his seat before his thoughts could catch up to him. \u201cThere is this place nearby called the Love-Labyrinth. I believe there are a few dark corners there good for making out.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">visit my <a href=\"https://hwasuga.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> to scream about lack of updates (don't actually)</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m dating a vampire.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung stretched over Wheein\u2019s lap, groaning loudly as the reality of his own words hit him; he palmed his face in his hands and peeked at his best friend through the gaps between his fingers. She gave him an unimpressed look in return. \u201cHelp me, Wheein. I\u2019m a walking <em>cliche</em>. I\u2019m oddly attracted to him and now I can\u2019t stop \u2014 I can\u2019t stop thinking of his stupid face.\u201d Taehyung hadn\u2019t even been able to focus at all during class today, only managing to doodle tiny vampires in the margins of his notebook. He had the fresh memory of Jeongguk\u2019s fangs nibbling softly at his lips running through his head on repeat. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUsually that\u2019s what it\u2019s like the you have a crush,\u201d Wheein grunted in reply, flicking Taehyung\u2019s forehead. \u201cIs he at least hot?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo hot,\u201d Taehyung groaned, trashing his feet a little in defiance. He hated admitting it. Hated admitting how sickeningly attracted he was to a stupid, fetus vampire. \u201c<em>Why</em> am I this pathetic? I didn\u2019t ask to be dragged into some mediocre fan fiction. It\u2019s <em>exam season</em>, I really don\u2019t need this!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSuck it up, Kim Taehyung.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry, bad choice of words?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>I\u2019d love to suck him</em>, Taehyung thought shamelessly, but he managed to keep himself from actually saying it out loud. As good of a friend Wheein was, Taehyung assumed she didn\u2019t want to know about his bedroom fantasies. She was also only now slowly coming to terms with the fact that Taehyung <em>wasn\u2019t </em>joking about the whole vampire thing, and that was more than enough support for the moment. Taehyung imagined it was difficult being his friend sometimes. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung sighed again, snuggling into the fabric of Wheein\u2019s cozy sweater. \u201cHe\u2019s cute. And hot. But he\u2019s a <em>vampire</em> and honestly I should fucking <em>know better. </em>How desperate am I for a good lay to divulge in something slightly reminiscent of necrophilia?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Taehyung</em>,\u201d Wheein wheezed. \u201cOh my God, please don\u2019t think of it like that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d Taehyung pouted. \u201cI\u2019m doomed. What if I <em>actually </em>start to like him, like \u2014 <em>like</em> like him? He\u2019s charming and all that, and physically he\u2019s like 126% my type. And since he\u2019s a vampire with enhanced strength and all that he could probably fuck me up against a wa \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Enough</em>,\u201d Wheein cut him off, placing a hand over Taehyung\u2019s rambling mouth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you actually <em>get </em>to the bone zone with your hot vampire boyfriend before you start to think about the feelings-aspect of it? Right now it sounds mostly like a crush \u2014 infatuation, maybe \u2014 and lust. Like, you\u2019re fond of him but mostly the idea of him. Is that right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. It didn\u2019t sound completely right. Not when he got a funny feeling in his stomach every time Jeongguk smiled so hard his fangs were showing. <em>Shit</em>. \u201cI guess,\u201d he lied, clearing his throat awkwardly. \u201cI just \u2014 now I have even more shit to worry about. Exams, getting my blood sucked \u2014 and now <em>feelings</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThough life you got there,\u201d Wheein snorted. \u201cJust take it easy, okay? Concentrate on your exams for now, keep in contact with your vampire boyfriend, and then you can talk this over once you have more time. I mean \u2014 if there is <em>anything</em> you guys have it\u2019s time, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTrue,\u201d Taehyung said, but somehow that didn\u2019t make him feel better. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein carted her fingers through Taehyung\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Taehyung. Now \u2014 please get off my lap. I have an essay in sociology that is due in 22 hours and I haven\u2019t even started it yet.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWant me to go get you some energy drinks?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wheein batted her eyelashes. \u201cPretty please?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Nodding, Taehyung patted his friend\u2019s head rather harshly. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll go out and get some refreshments for you. Start that paper, the snacks will be a reward for what you get done. I\u2019m going to do get my coat.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Reward</em>,\u201d Wheein snorted. \u201cIf anything this should be you paying back to me for having to listen to all your drunk ramblings thorough the year. I didn\u2019t <em>need</em> to know about your vampire fantasies, or dreams of being sandwiched between several Monsta X-members \u2014 yet here we are.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFine. Whatever. I\u2019ll be back with your <em>payment</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Pulling on his coat \u2014 the autumn sun was harsh today, and the air crisp and cold \u2014 Taehyung tailed out of Wheein\u2019s small apartment to the closest convenience store. It was only a few hundred meters down the road, right next to a bakery, and Taehyung had been there one too many times after getting piss drunk at Wheein\u2019s place. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung politely greeted the prepubescent boy behind the counter and walked straight to the snacks aisle, surveying the different options. He knew Wheein\u2019s favorites by heart at this point, and was about to grab a bag of dried squid when his phone rang. <em>Count Draculame</em> flashed on his screen, and Taehyung answered it embarrassingly fast. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding panicked. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. \u201cUhm \u2014 I\u2019m at a convenience store? Buying snacks?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Where</em>, Taehyung?\u201d Jeongguk stressed. \u201cI need to know <em>where</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He supposed something was wrong, because Jeongguk really didn\u2019t sound like he was joking. \u201cIt\u2019s in Yongsan, close to the international school,\u201d Taehyung said, \u201cwhat, do you want the exact address or \u2014?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, I\u2019ll find you,\u201d Jeongguk said. \u201cStay where you are.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung exclaimed, but Jeongguk had already hung up. \u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em> you stupid bloodsucker.\u201d He stared out the windows on the front of the store, and true enough the sun was shining. It was definitively not ideal weather for Jeongguk to go <em>anywhere </em>outside. Why was he even <em>awake</em> at this hour? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung made sure his phone was on the loudest sound setting before slipping it back into his pocket, turning back to the task at hand. He grabbed a few bags of crisps and moved towards the drinks section, contemplating sitting down in the small dining area with some instant noodles to wait for Jeongguk. He didn\u2019t know <em>how</em> fast a vampire could run exactly (or where Jeongguk even was at the time of the call), but the vampire had sounded very desperate so Taehyung was going to follow orders for once. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung grabbed a box of cup noodles and paid for all the snacks and drinks, and just as he sat down in the tiny seating area by the microwaves and kettles, Jeongguk stormed in. He was wearing a cap, sunglasses and a mask, body fully covered in clothing and hood pulled up over his head; as far as Taehyung could see there was basically no visible skin on him yet Jeongguk smelled a little bit <em>burnt</em>, and Taehyung wrinkled his nose as Jeongguk crashed down in the chair next to his. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk pulled off the face mask and sunglasses, quickly, and looked at Taehyung with obvious distress. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWha \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHug.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There was no time to protest before Jeongguk pulled him in for an embrace, squeezing Taehyung as close as he possibly could while they were still sitting on the spindly chairs. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jeongguk muttered, lips barely brushing over Taehyung\u2019s ear. Taehyung shuddered. \u201cI woke up to a scare.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d Taehyung frowned, burrowing his face into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder to hide his oncoming blush. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin called. There\u2019s a rouge vampire loose in the city.\u201d Jeongguk sighed deeply, pulled away slightly to look at Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t spotted anywhere near this neighborhood but \u2014 I was still worried. It\u2019s stupid. But \u2014 but if you\u2019ll let me, can I just stay with you until the immediate threat is taken care of?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung felt warmth wash over him at Jeongguk\u2019s pleading expression, and he couldn\u2019t really bring himself to protest. Sure, Jeongguk was probably overreacting and Jimin surely had the situation under control, but Taehyung \u2014 Taehyung liked that Jeongguk worried. That he cared enough about Taehyung to have ran out in the <em>scorching sun</em> to make sure he was okay. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He still smelled weird though, and Taehyung only noticed why when he got a good look at Jeongguk\u2019s hands. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s hands without gloves. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShit, Jeongguk!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire\u2019s hands had obvious burns and blisters on them, and Taehyung made a sound of terror because <em>holy shit</em> it looked painful. He carefully grabbed Jeongguk\u2019s wrists, making sure not to touch the burnt areas, inspecting them carefully. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he hissed, shooting Jeongguk a sharp glare. \u201cYou should have worn gloves, you idiot!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll heal \u2014\u201d Jeongguk started, but Taehyung was having none of it. He stood up from his seat and stomped towards the teenage cashier. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you have any bandages or something?\u201d Taehyung asked, the cashier jumping at how sharp the tone of his voice was. \u201cFirst aid kit? My <em>stupid</em> boyfriend managed to get himself hurt.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The poor convenience store employee stuttered out a <em>I think we have a first aid kit in the back I\u2019ll go get it</em>, and ran to the back of the store, through a door that said \u2018staff only\u2019. It was obvious he was just a little bit terrified of Taehyung, because he returned in less than 20 seconds, green first-aid kit in his hands. \u201cThanks kid,\u201d Taehyung said, grabbing it out of the cashier\u2019s grip. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He slammed the first-aid kit onto the table in front of Jeongguk, opened it, and started pulling out the necessities for taking care of burns; some antibiotic ointment and bandages. Taehyung once worked at a summer camp and had to take first aid class, so he could probably handle a sunburnt vampire. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHands on the table,\u201d Taehyung instructed. Jeongguk was staring dumbly at him. \u201c<em>Now</em>, idiot.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk did as he was told, but Taehyung could still sense the vampire staring intently at him. Taehyung tried to ignore it and pulled out a bottle of water he\u2019d bought from the bag of snacks by his feet. \u201cThis might sting,\u201d he said, before pouring cold water onto the blisters on Jeongguk\u2019s hands. The vampire sharply hissed, and Taehyung turned to see Jeongguk\u2019s fangs biting into his bottom lip, eyes turning a startling red. <em>Well</em>, Taehyung thought, <em>I guess it\u2019s really painful. </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey,\u201d Taehyung said, softly, after looking over his shoulder and making sure the cashier wasn\u2019t meddling in their business. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s gonna hurt, but you\u2019ll handle it, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk nodded, quickly, and Taehyung took that as a sign to pour more cold water onto the vampire\u2019s hands; Jeongguk groaned this time, less vocal, and then he dived forward and hid his face in the shoulder of Taehyung\u2019s ugly alumni sweatshirt. <em>Hurts, </em>he muttered, but Taehyung kept his resolve and continued pouring, knowing the cold water would soothe the nasty burns on his hands. It wasn\u2019t an ideal place to nurse burns, but it would have to do for now. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He managed to carefully dry the vampire\u2019s hands before dabbing some ointment onto the burns, Jeongguk now fully pressed up against his side and nuzzling into the crook of Taehyung\u2019s neck. Taehyung didn\u2019t even <em>think</em> about how close Jeongguk\u2019s teeth were to his throat at this point, fully immersed in the task at hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, bandages,\u201d Taehyung said, grabbing for the gauze, \u201calmost done, Jeongguk.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMhm.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wrapping Jeongguk\u2019s hands carefully in bandages, it turned out, was a simple task. Jeongguk had stopped whining and hissing at this point, saying that the pain was slight. Apparently he healed fast, but never <em>this</em> fast, so Taehyung felt oddly proud as he looked at his finished work; Jeongguk\u2019s hands and fingers were almost completely covered by the bandage. \u201cThere we go,\u201d Taehyung said, and he watched as Jeongguk removed his head from Taehyung\u2019s shoulder and stared down at his fingers. \u201cAs good as new.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Jeongguk said, expression soft, and then he put his chin back on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re great.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI sure am,\u201d Taehyung said, staring at the mess on the table. They would have to really clean this up before leaving, because water was dripping onto the floor and there were bits of bandage everywhere. \u201cSure you would have done the same.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOf course,\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice rumbled, and Taehyung could practically hear grin on his lips. It amazed Taehyung how quickly Jeongguk could go from <em>pissy vampire-baby </em>to <em>piece of shit</em>. He felt Jeongguk shift, and then his lips pressed against Taehyung\u2019s cheek, and he <em>giggled</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung narrowed his eyes and turned just slightly to look at the vampire; Jeongguk had a shit-eating grin on his face, as expected. \u201cWhat?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou called me your boyfriend.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung\u2019s heart stuttered. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cD-did I?\u201d he said, quickly. \u201cSlip of the tongue.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Aha</em>. You, know, I\u2019d love to slip my tongue \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Quiet,</em>\u201d Taehyung stressed, looking towards the cash register, where the unfortunate employee was very obviously doing everything in his power <em>not</em> to stare at them. Taehyung sure hoped Jeongguk\u2019s <em>vampire sugar</em> would help the guy forget everything that happened in this convenience store today. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to still be in <em>pain,</em> dickhead.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk only laughed, slipping his arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist and hugging him close, to the point where Taehyung thought Jeongguk would actually pull him into his lap. He made a strangled sound, not knowing how to hug Jeongguk back in this position; the vampire was snuggling his face into the crook of Taehyung\u2019s neck again, and this time Taehyung was <em>very</em> aware of how close Jeongguk\u2019s fangs were. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re great, Kim Taehyung,\u201d Jeongguk muttered against Taehyung\u2019s skin. \u201cThe best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung did not trust himself to reply, but he thought Jeongguk was pretty great, too. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>from: [count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; my sire wants to meet you</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>to: [count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; no</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>from: [count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; ???? what? thats rude, taehyung, he really wants to meet you</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; so does his mate</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>to: [count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; im not ready to meet your parents</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>from: [count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; they\u2019re not my parents taehyung</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>to: [count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; okay fine</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; im not ready to meet your vampire daddy</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>from: [count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; please don't ever refer to namjoon in that way ever again</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As soon as Taehyung\u2019s exams were over \u2014 and Jeongguk\u2019s, apparently \u2014 the vampire did convince Taehyung to come meet his sire, with the promise that Jimin would be there as well. It was a <em>get-together</em>, Jeongguk said, and Taehyung grimaced at him, because honestly he wasn\u2019t all that stoked about meeting Jeongguk\u2019s vampire-parents. Vampire-benefactors. Whatever Jeongguk wanted to call them. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know,\u201d Taehyung complained when they were taking the elevator to the penthouse of a gigantic apartment complex in Gangnam, \u201cthis means I\u2019ll go through the <em>bullshit</em> of meeting your parents <em>twice</em>. Because you have <em>two</em> sets of parents.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cNamjoon and Seokjin are <em>not</em> my parents, Taehyung, please calm down,\u201d he said, and Taehyung grimaced at him in the gigantic mirror in front of them. The mirror Jeongguk didn\u2019t even show up in. \u201cIf I take you to meet my <em>actual</em> parents I\u2019m pretty sure <em>I\u2019ll </em>be the nervous wreck, because I haven\u2019t actually met them face-to-face since I was turned.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve avoided your parents for a year?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk muttered. \u201cI\u2019m an asshole, I know.

Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Taehyung slid his hand into Jeongguk\u2019s, squeezing it quickly. \u201cBut for now \u2014 let\u2019s deal with the vamps, yeah? I mean, you might grow tired of me and my pungent blood so fast I won\u2019t ever have to meet them.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The elevator dinged open. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Jeongguk said, and Taehyung ignored the rapid beating of his heart as Jeongguk pulled him out of the lift. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The penthouse apartment was gigantic, the elevator leading them straight into a wide hallway with a staircase, chandelier hanging from the roof of the second floor. Taehyung stared in awe, nearly tripping over himself when Jeongguk told him to take his shoes off. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHello! Welcome to our lair!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung looked up from where he was putting on the adorable guest slippers \u2014 they had little bat faces on them! \u2014 Jeongguk offered him to see a tall, dimpled man walk towards them down the grand staircase. He was dressed in clothing certainly unsuited for this century, and Taehyung thought he looked like some king. A vampire king. \u201cUhm \u2014 hello,\u201d he greeted, a voice reminding him in the back of his head that this guy was, like, ancient. Definitively old enough for Taehyung to have to bow 90 degrees. So he did. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh \u2014 no need to be so formal!\u201d the vampire said, taking Taehyung\u2019s hand suddenly and shaking it. Taehyung heard Jeongguk sigh loudly from the side. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! I may be old, but I\u2019m down with the kids.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Oh boy</em>,\u201d Jeongguk whispered, and Taehyung blinked at the smiling, regal vampire, trying to process those words. <em>Down with the kids</em>. \u201cTaehyung, this is my <em>sire</em>, Namjoon. Namjoon this is Taehyung, my \u2014 my \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Taehyung finished, when Jeongguk looked at him with an expression that said \u2018<em>what the fuck do I introduce you as\u2019</em>. \u201cBoyfriend, possible bloodbag. We\u2019ll see where the future leads.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Possible bloodbag</em>,\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s sire \u2014 Namjoon \u2014 repeated, frowning. \u201cI hope he isn\u2019t forcing you into anything you do not want, Taehyung. If you\u2019re going to be Jeongguk\u2019s subjugate, then that\u2019s very nice of you, but make sure every feeding is on <em>your</em> terms, okay?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Namjoon-hyung</em>,\u201d Jeongguk whined. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung was confused. <em>Subjugate</em>? \u201cUh \u2014 thank you for your concern, sir, but Jeongguk hasn\u2019t even really\u2026 <em>fed</em> on me yet.\u201d Though, Taehyung would admit, he was thinking more and more about it these days. He was wondering if it would hurt as much as he remembered it to, and if Jeongguk was going to just do it when he felt Taehyung tasted good enough. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he had been very good at taking his meds lately to prepare for it, but he hoped Jeongguk was going to give him at least a warning. He wasn\u2019t <em>against</em> the idea anymore, but there were things he needed to know. \u201cI\u2019m anemic, sir, so I don\u2019t \u2014 taste good. Working on it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk\u2019s arm snuck around Taehyung\u2019s waist, pressing a kiss to Taehyung\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure you taste great, Tae,\u201d he voiced. \u201cI mean, I hope. Won\u2019t bite you until we\u2019re sure, though.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMhm,\u201d Taehyung hummed, willing down his blush. \u201cUh \u2014 thank you for inviting me, sir.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The older vampire smiled, looking very non-murderous for a vampire that was supposedly 500 years old. \u201cOh, it was my pleasure. Jeonggukie has been talking about you non-stop, so we couldn\u2019t wait to actually meet you. Why don\u2019t you join us in the dining room? Seokjin should be done with the food by now, and the other guests have already arrived.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">With Jeongguk\u2019s arm still around him, Taehyung followed Namjoon towards the right, into a dining hall. The chandeliers seemed to be a running theme, and there were old-looking paintings on the wall and a myriad of potted plants situated around the room. In the middle was a long dining table, dressed with blood-red tablecloth; the food on the table looked positively mouthwatering, and Taehyung was very happy he hadn\u2019t eaten at all today. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin was there, and so was his faerie boyfriend Yoongi, the two of them talking animatedly to a guy with tanned skin, orangey-blond hair and startling yellow eyes. When he laughed loudly at something Jimin said and his mouth opened wide, Taehyung got a good look at his sharp canines.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou already met Jimin,\u201d Jeongguk started as they sat down, and Jimin sent Taehyung an exaggerated wink from the other end of the table. Taehyung did a double-take at him, and wondered how he hadn\u2019t seen the obvious scars on Jimin\u2019s face before. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have to introduce you again. That\u2019s \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI met Yoongi, too, actually,\u201d Taehyung said, trying not to stare too obviously as Jimin rolled up the sleeves of his sweater and exposed more scarred skin; bite-marks, claw-marks, <em>lots</em> of them. \u201cLike, very briefly, but we met.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yoongi nodded, as if to confirm this. \u201cYeah. Jeongguk\u2019s only friend. I remember you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Hyung</em>,\u201d Jeongguk complained. Yoongi grinned, looking very satisfied with himself. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Jeongguk continued, motioning towards the unknown guy with the yellow eyes. \u201cThis is Hoseok, the family dog.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Rude</em>,\u201d <em>Hoseok</em> said, eyes gleaming with mirth. \u201cDon\u2019t mind the mosquito, cutie, he\u2019s just being pissy because he <em>totally</em> knows werewolves are far superior to vampires.\u201d Jeongguk mumbled something about <em>can\u2019t believe you\u2019re saying this in a vampire\u2019s home</em>, but Taehyung was too excited to care at the moment. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf?\u201d Taehyung asked. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hoseok was grinning wide. \u201cI <em>know</em> right?\u201d he said, giving Jeongguk a knowing smirk. \u201cSee, Jeonggukie? Even your friend knows I\u2019m better. <em>Suck it</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung felt like there might be some rivalry between them \u2014 some sort of competition he didn\u2019t know about \u2014 because soon enough Jeongguk\u2019s arms were around his waist again, chin propped onto Taehyung\u2019s shoulder and lips impossibly close to his neck. It was like Jeongguk <em>knew</em> this particular position got Taehyung extremely flustered. \u201cTae,\u201d he whined, kissing just below his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m still the coolest, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cT-the coolest,\u201d Taehyung uttered, cheeks flushed. He tried to push the clingy vampire off. \u201cVampires are the best. <em>You\u2019re</em> the best.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That seemed to have been the answer Jeongguk wanted to hear, because he let Taehyung go and moved \u2014 more or less \u2014 into his own seat. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yoongi clicked his tongue, pink eyes fretting between them. \u201cFriends, huh?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The food was spectacular, all of it prepared by Namjoon\u2019s mate, Kim Seokjin. Apparently he owned several restaurants around Seoul, and Taehyung assumed that would be the vampires\u2019 main source of income. He just thought it was very fascinating that someone who didn\u2019t <em>need </em>to eat had decided to become a chef. \u201cYou know, you learn to appreciate food a lot more when you don\u2019t need it,\u201d Seokjin said. Taehyung had deemed Seokjin the responsible one, since Namjoon had already managed to knock over two glasses of wine during their short time together. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was kind of funny. Namjoon was hundreds of years old yet he was clumsy as hell. <em>Fearful creature of the night</em> indeed. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk was the only one not eating, sitting next to Taehyung sipping blood out of a plastic cup. He used a straw, even, to <em>be polite to the guests</em>, but Taehyung felt a little bad for him. It looked like he really wanted to eat beef and <em>jjigae</em> and everything else with the rest of them, and instead he was stuck with some mediocre O positive. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is amazing, as usual,\u201d Jimin told Seokjin, mouth full of food. Yoongi grimaced from the side, told him to <em>take it easy, you aren\u2019t healed yet</em>, while pressing a careful hand to Jimin\u2019s stomach. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He must have gotten hurt tracking down the rouge vampire Jeongguk talked about. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Jeongguk voiced Taehyung\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThe rouge?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTook him down, obviously,\u201d Jimin said with a grin, pride evident in his voice, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park. It was an experienced vampire, not just a fledgling the werewolf aides had lost track of. He got a few good scratches and bites in \u2014 but of course I handled it. Worst thing is just that while I\u2019m healing, mister <em>grumpy pants \u2014</em>\u201d Jimin good-naturedly bumped Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, \u201cwon\u2019t let me wear my magic. Which is probably why Taehyung keeps looking at me like he\u2019s seen a ghost.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung spluttered when the attention suddenly turned to him. \u201cN-no!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI just \u2014 I was just worried, it\u2019s a lot of scars!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yoongi scoffed, \u201cyeah, and he\u2019s proud of each and every one of them.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA warrior bears his scars with pride, <em>honey</em>,\u201d Jimin teased, effectively making Yoongi roll his eyes again. Their relationship was interesting, honestly. Taehyung really wondered how a half-fairy ended up dating a vampire slayer. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry, Taehyung, Yoongi takes good care of me. I\u2019m not hurt, and the only reason I use magic to hide the scars is because they frighten the vampires a little. The ones that show up at the bar, I mean. Most of them know I\u2019m a hunter, but seeing the scars makes it kind of more real, you know?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung didn\u2019t really know, but he nodded anyway. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you took care of it,\u201d Namjoon spoke, \u201cyou hunters make it better for us who try lead normal lives.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGot your back, Boss Vamp,\u201d Jimin winked.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was cool. <em>Jimin</em> was cool, because Taehyung didn\u2019t really want to imagine what his meeting with Jeongguk had been like if vampires weren\u2019t relatively peaceful. Actually, if Namjoon wasn\u2019t your friendly neighborhood vampire, if he hadn\u2019t been there when Jeongguk had his accident \u2014 Taehyung still didn\u2019t know exactly what kind of accident it was \u2014 then Jeongguk would have been dead. Taehyung would never even have met him if he hadn\u2019t been turned by <em>upstanding citizen vampires</em> Namjoon and Seokjin. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The thought made him sad, very suddenly, and he turned to look at Jeongguk, who was grinning widely at something Namjoon and Seokjin were talking about. He looked carefree, <em>young</em>, and while the fangs were a clear indicator he wasn\u2019t just some normal guy, Taehyung was just <em>happy</em> he was there. Happy Jeongguk wasn\u2019t dead. Happy Jeongguk had cornered him in that alleyway trying to drink his blood, so that Taehyung had the chance to get to know him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Shit</em>, Taehyung thought. <em>I\u2019ve already gone and fallen for his stupid, bloodsucking ass. </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou okay?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk was staring at him, looking just a little bit worried. Taehyung snapped out of his daze, shook his head and sent the vampire a smile that hopefully said <em>I-am-fine-and-I-did-not-just-realize-I-am a-little-bit-in-love-with-you. </em>\u201cYeah, just spaced out for a bit,\u201d Taehyung said, taking a deep breath. \u201cA little tired, that\u2019s all. My Chinese literature exam kicked my ass.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah?\u201d Jeongguk didn\u2019t look to convinced. \u201cYou sure? You look a little \u2014 upset?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYour face has that effect.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Wow</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk dropped the subject, then, and they finished their meal not saying another word. Seokjin said there would be dessert as soon as everyone was feeling up for it, and ordered Jeongguk to show Taehyung around the house in the meantime. As much as Taehyung really wanted a house tour however, he wanted some time alone with Jeongguk more. They hadn\u2019t really seen each other the last week, and that realization of <em>Jeongguk could have been fucking dead</em> hit him very hard. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He just really wanted a hug. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is my room,\u201d Jeongguk said, sounding very much like a nervous teenager while saying so. He had pulled Taehyung up the grand staircase in the hallway to the second floor and entered the first room on their left. His room was a lot less <em>vampire</em> than Taehyung expected; there were no windows, obviously, only posters of IU and BigBang on the walls, and a boring desk with a laptop on it. There was no coffin, either. Only a queen-sized bed with bland, blue bedsheets. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuh,\u201d Taehyung voiced. \u201cI expected more.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 more what?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know? More of a <em>dark lair</em>, I guess. Stone walls. A coffin for you to sleep in.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk snorted. \u201cCoffins are extremely inconvenient. And claustrophobic. And not at all ideal for sexy times.\u201d Taehyung supposed he could see that. He wasn\u2019t all that tempted at having sex with his hot vampire boyfriend in a coffin. \u201cNot even Seokjin likes them, and he\u2019s ancient,\u201d Jeongguk added. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat about Namjoo \u2014 ah!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Suddenly pulling Taehyung down with him, Jeongguk fell down on the soft bedsheets; Taehyung made a slightly embarrassing sound as Jeongguk winded his arms around Taehyung\u2019s shoulders and snuggled him into his chest. Taehyung was kind of happy he could hide his reddening cheeks in Jeongguk\u2019s white t-shirt. \u201cHm \u2014 Namjoon is a special case,\u201d Jeongguk started to answer Taehyung\u2019s question, \u201cyou know those hipster kids, who only listens to indie bands and wears thrift shop clothing and only eats organic? Thinks they\u2019re all special because they still appreciate the <em>classics?</em>\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUgh, yeah.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s Namjoon. Just with vampirism.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, wow.\u201d Taehyung made absent patterns on Jeongguk\u2019s chest. \u201cHe\u2019s kinda lame.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTell me about it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung pressed his lips together, and then he moved up and rested his elbows in Jeongguk\u2019s chest. <em>Oof, what the fuck, dude</em>, Jeongguk mumbled, but Taehyung cut him off with a short kiss. \u201cStill wanna thank him,\u201d Taehyung said quietly. \u201cNamjoon.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2018Cause he saved you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk turned silent, red eyes boring into Taehyung\u2019s; he raised his hand and ran his fingers through Taehyung\u2019s fringe. \u201cYeah, he did.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat happened, really?\u201d Taehyung pressed, because it felt like the place and time to discuss this. \u201cHow did you\u2026 die? You said it was an accident, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire looked sheepish, all of a sudden. \u201cYeah \u2014 yeah, it was an accident, kinda. And it was stupid, but I don\u2019t really regret it, you know?\u201d Taehyung really didn\u2019t. \u201cAh, of course, you don\u2019t know,\u201d Jeongguk continued, voice turning small. \u201cSo \u2014 I used to do a lot of night deliveries about a year ago, and I was out like, after midnight on my vespa \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung snorted. \u201cA vespa.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Shut up</em>. Anyway, I saw this kid, probably a high schooler, and he was cornered by a few thugs and stuff. I\u2019d taken a few boxing classes, thought I could handle them and save this kid, but you know \u2014 they were three guys with knives.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh my <em>God</em>.\u201d Jeongguk flinched. \u201cShit, <em>Jeongguk</em>, you\u2019re an <em>idiot</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI <em>know</em> you\u2019re an idiot, but that takes the cake!\u201d Taehyung frowned deeply at the small, flustered smile on Jeongguk\u2019s face. \u201cDid the kid get away, at least?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk nodded. \u201cYeah. He managed to run away and I got stabbed a lot. And then Namjoon found me bleeding out in an alley. He said my last, dying breath was inspiring so he decided to turn me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDunno. Never asked.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung hummed, staring down at Jeongguk; he looked kind of silly from this angle, and Taehyung wanted to bring out his phone and take a blackmail-worthy photo of the vampire and his several chins. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But his own tears<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>kind of stopped him from doing just that. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh shit. Shit, Taehyung, why are you crying?!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d Taehyung sniffled, hurriedly sitting up and covering his face with his hands. Shit, he was really sobbing at this point, tears flowing down his cheeks like crazy. \u201cYou f-fucking <em>idiot</em>! How could you g-go ahead and do something so stupid? Why the fuck d-did you have to go and play <em>h-hero</em>, h-huh?\u201d He smacked Jeongguk\u2019s chest, the vampire releasing a slight grunt. \u201cYou could have died for real! What if Namjoon hadn\u2019t been there, huh?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Grimacing, Jeongguk rubbed the spot where Taehyung punched. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve thought about that myself,\u201d he uttered. \u201cI <em>know</em> it was stupid, but at this point there isn\u2019t really anything I can do to change it. I\u2019m not dead, Tae. Thanks to Namjoon I\u2019m not.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut you <em>could</em> have been!\u201d Taehyung stressed, leaning down to cup Jeongguk\u2019s face in his hands and forcefully squish his face together. \u201cI could have never met you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire looked surprised at those words, and he hurriedly \u2014 flustered \u2014 avoided Taehyung\u2019s gaze. \u201cI \u2014\u201d Jeongguk started, voice cracking, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be this upset upon realizing this? I mean, I kind of already thought you\u2019d given this some thought, so I wasn\u2019t expecting you to\u2026 cry.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung fumed. \u201cYou\u2019re my <em>boyfriend </em>you useless bloodsucker, <em>of course</em> I\u2019m upset thinking about the way you fucking <em>died</em>. I <em>like</em> you.\u201d Slowly he leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to Jeongguk\u2019s nose. \u201cI\u2019m sure you put some sort of magic spell on me. I can\u2019t believe you made me fall for your lame, undead ass.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMhm.\u201d The smile on Jeongguk\u2019s face was bright and childish and fucking <em>adorable</em>. \u201cI really like you too.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou better.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sitting up straight again \u2014 more like <em>straddling</em> <em>Jeongguk\u2019s hips </em>\u2014 Taehyung sniffled, and dried the last few tears remaining on his face. \u201cHey,\u201d Jeongguk said softly, lifting his hand and softly caressing his cheek. \u201cI like you lots. And m\u2019not dead. Not <em>that</em> dead, at least.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk pulled him down again, and Taehyung pressed his face against the side of the vampire\u2019s neck, and Jeongguk threaded fingers through his hair. Then, unexpectedly, as Taehyung grew very comfortable and a little drowsy, Jeongguk\u2019s body started shaking with laughter. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung mumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted you wet in my bed.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 fuck off.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[to: count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; so i\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 what exactly DID you say to namjoon that made him change you?? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[from: count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; idk, must have been pretty groundbreaking</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[to: count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; or lame</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; like</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; \u201ci cant die I'm still a virgin\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt; haha im joking</span><br> <br> &gt; jeongguk??</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; omg are you really</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[from: count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; FUCK YOU IM NOT</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Taehyung started, dumping a myriad of blankets onto his couch. \u201cI have Netflix, so we can watch movies, but I also own like every episode of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and every Harry Potter movie ever made, so we have a ton of options.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jeongguk was standing in Taehyung\u2019s miniature kitchen, popping them (Taehyung) popcorn. With their schedules being pretty much free and their relationship dwelling into the Serious Zone, Taehyung had invited Jeongguk to stay the weekend at his place. Of course, Jeongguk could have entered Taehyung apartment at any time since he moved back (Wheein got tired of him after a week), but because he was a Good Vampire, Jeongguk did not. Instead he waited until he got an actual invitation. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It would be a lie to say Taehyung wasn\u2019t a <em>little</em> excited to have Jeongguk over for so long. Of course he would be, because at this point Taehyung just really enjoyed Jeongguk\u2019s company. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m okay with, like, everything,\u201d Jeongguk said. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched Harry Potter, though.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung froze with the remote in his hand, slowly turning to look at the vampire. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s blasphemy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re part of a <em>magical world </em>yourself holy shit that\u2019s \u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI \u2014 I mean, I guess \u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s a <em>sin</em>, Jeon Jeongguk. I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t watched <em>Harry Potter</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Rolling his eyes, Jeongguk pulled the bag of popcorn out of the microwave. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, rummaging through one of Taehyung\u2019s small cupboards on the search for a big enough bowl, \u201cI guess we\u2019re watching it now, so you can educate me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou <em>bet</em> we are.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung had seen Harry Potter many times before, but despite the great replay value, he couldn\u2019t find himself to focus this time. Sure, it was cute watching Jungkook get all interested and excited about one of his favorite series of all time, and Taehyung thought it was hilarious seeing Jungkook\u2019s annoyed expression when he said there were no vampires in the films, just werewolves. But Taehyung didn\u2019t actually want to just watch a movie tonight, he realized.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As soon as Taehyung finished half the bowl of popcorn, he decided it was a little unfair that he was here, stuffing his face with delicious snacks while Jungkook couldn\u2019t eat food again yet. Taehyung had been taking his supplements, he hadn\u2019t had dizzy spell in months, and maybe he didn\u2019t want to admit that he was doing it more for Jungkook than himself, but that\u2019s exactly what he did was doing. He was still scared, he really was, but not really for the same reason any more. Taehyung was more scared about Jungkook not wanting him around after drinking his blood than the pain. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">(The pain was still an inevitable thing to be scared of too, of course.)</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook tore his eyes away from the movie - they\u2019d barely made it halfway through the second film, and Taehyung could tell Jungkook was already quite into it. \u201cHm?\u201d he uttered, immediately looking back to the screen, where there had been another unfortunate petrification. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung swallowed, thickly. \u201cWant some snacks?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook snorted, rolled his eyes. \u201cCan\u2019t eat popcorn. You know that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Putting the popcorn aside, Taehyung took a deep breath before hurriedly straddling Jungkook\u2019s lap. The vampire made a small noise of surprise, hands moving to Taehyung\u2019s hips by instinct to stabilize him. \u201cUhh - what the -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWasn\u2019t talking about popcorn,\u201d Taehyung mumbled, one arm winding around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. He leaned forward, elated at the surprised expression on Jungkook\u2019s face. He supposed Jungkook hadn\u2019t expected him to be this forward. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI -\u201d Jungkook\u2019s red eyes widened as Taehyung reached up and pulled the collar of his shirt down to bare his neck, \u201c- you - you seriously mean -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, if you\u2019re thirsty...\u201d Taehyung mumbled, feeling the color rise in his cheeks. \u201cIf you want to try and see how it tastes again, then - then I\u2019m willing to -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook surged forward, latching his lips onto Taehyung\u2019s, the kiss soft and chaste yet a little rushed and desperate. Taehyung hummed, because God he loved kissing Jungkook. He loved when Jungkook held onto him, hugged him, pressed kisses against his skin and looked at Taehyung like he wanted to spent his entire immortal life with him. He didn\u2019t feel like he deserved the affection and obvious feelings Jungkook harbored for him, but Taehyung still liked him \u2014 <em>fuck</em>, he liked him <em>so much</em>. Maybe Taehyung wasn\u2019t ready join the life of vampirism yet, but he wasn\u2019t about to just throw away a relationship he was genuinely interested in trying to make work. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou serious?\u201d Jungkook asked, staring up at Taehyung with glittering eyes. He looked so happy. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou sure?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung nodded, hurriedly, ignoring the warmth spreading in his chest at the smile on Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cCome on, you knew I was gonna agree at some point, so -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just - I wanted to make sure to get your permission this time around, since - since I practically tried draining you without your consent the first time we met. Uhm - I\u2019m - are you absolutely sure, then?\u201d Again, Taehyung nodded, not trusting himself to speak. \u201cOkay - okay, just - let me go get something real quick, okay?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung barely had time to blink before Jungkook flipped him onto the couch, onto his back, and ran towards the hallway to get his jacket. Jungkook zoomed back with a small handful of bandages and a bottle of some weird, glowing liquid. Narrowing his eyes, Taehyung stared suspiciously at the items. \u201cYou were expecting this to happen, weren\u2019t you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The vampire bit his bottom lip. \u201cAt - at some point, yes? I just wanted to make sure we were prepared when, you know, we were gonna do it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou sound like we\u2019re about to have sex.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c... you wanna have sex?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNow?\u201d Taehyung spluttered, because honestly he didn\u2019t think about Jungkook drinking his blood as something very sexy. It had hurt like hell the first time, and he wasn\u2019t expecting it to hurt any less just because they knew each other now. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shook his head, quickly, looking very flustered. \u201cN-no, not now! I mean, it\u2019s probably going to leave you a little light-headed since it\u2019s the first time, and it\u2019s not going to be ideal to fuck you with blood pouring out of your neck -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot ideal,\u201d Taehyung repeated. \u201cReally, Kook?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s, uhh - it\u2019s just that it gets better, you know, if you allow me to drink from you more times. Like you body will get used to it, is all! And we don\u2019t have to - I mean - if you don\u2019t -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung sighed. \u201cI want to have sex with you, you idiot,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cBut maybe not while we\u2019re doing this? Maybe later?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Nodding, Jungkook nervously sat down on the couch next to Taehyung again, Taehyung propping himself up on his elbows. He watched as Jungkook put the bandages and the mystery liquid on the coffee table, next to the bowl of popcorn. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he dared to ask, pointing towards the glowing bottle. There was a label on it, but the language was unfamiliar to Taehyung. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. It\u2019s some ointment. I got it from a witch friend of mine,\u201d Jungkook said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to heal vampire wounds faster, and numb the pain pretty quickly, too. I picked it up because - because I don\u2019t want it to hurt.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung quirked one eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care about my pain that much the first time,\u201d Taehyung commented. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat was different,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, playing with his fingers in his lap. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in love with you then.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung felt his heart-rate pick up, and he was pretty sure Jungkook could hear it too. \u201cOh,\u201d he stuttered, voice embarrassingly high-pitched. \u201cI \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 t-thank you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was quiet for a while, the only sound in the room being the movie playing in the background. Taehyung was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on it at all, not after this; especially not if Jungkook was speaking the truth about the whole <em>you\u2019re gonna get lightheaded\u2014</em>thing. \u201cSo \u2014 you going to suck me or what?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 <em>what</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy <em>blood</em>, Jungkook. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d Ah, Taehyung loved when his big vampire boyfriend blushed. Filled him with absolute <em>glee</em>. \u201cI\u2019m not immortal, get a move on.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook didn\u2019t even bother trying to act annoyed. \u201cOkay. Yeah, fuck, I\u2019m actually really thirsty, so \u2014 don\u2019t mind if I do?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He was fumbling with his words, which was insanely adorable. \u201cAlright. How do you want me?\u201d Taehyung smirked, because he knew how this sounded in this situation. \u201cOn my back? Arms above my head? What <em>is</em> the optimal sucking position?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose,\u201d Jungkook grunted. \u201cYou want a blowjob too?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot from <em>you</em>,\u201d Taehyung sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m not letting these \u2014\u201d he leaned up, put a finger between Jungkook\u2019s lips and pressed it against one of his fangs, \u201c\u2014 anywhere near my penis, Mr. Vampire.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook sighed. \u201cAlright. No blowjobs. Sad face.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not saying <em>you\u2019re</em> not getting any blowjobs,\u201d Taehyung said, leaning back against the armrest of the couch. He sent a wink in Jungkook\u2019s direction, though it kind of failed and he ended up just blinked weirdly. He was too nervous to pretend to be very suave in this situation. \u201cJust not now. I really don\u2019t like the idea of mixing blood and sex, Jungkook.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGot it. Well, then.\u201d Taehyung swallowed a squeak as Jungkook moved to loom all over him. <em>Fuck</em>, he was so fucking hot. \u201cHere I go,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, licking his lips slowly as he leaned down to Taehyung\u2019s neck. \u201cJust lie still, baby.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung didn\u2019t even dare to nod, going completely still as he felt Jungkook\u2019s mouth on his neck. He expected it to happen fast, but Jungkook hesitated, barely breathing over his skin. \u201cSlap my arm if you want me to stop, okay?\u201d Jungkook said, pulling away briefly to give Taehyung a serious look, the joking atmosphere suddenly completely vanished. \u201cOr \u2014 just, say the stupid safe word you came up with. You remember it, I \u2014 you\u2019re absolutely sure, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Taehyung groaned, getting annoyed. Jungkook\u2019s stalling was making him more nervous. \u201cJust \u2014 just get on with it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook breathed in, leaned down again, and placed his mouth against Taehyung\u2019s neck. He didn\u2019t beat around the bush this time, and Taehyung winced as the sharp fangs pierced his skin. It <em>hurt</em>, it really did, and Jungkook\u2019s body was pressing him into the couch, preventing him from moving much. \u201cYep,\u201d Taehyung mumbled, \u201cthis is as painful as I remembered it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It felt like Jungkook was moving away because of his words, so Taehyung hurriedly circled his arms around the vampire and pulled him closer. \u201cJust <em>drink</em>, Jungkook. I can handle it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook hummed, sucking against the wound; it stung, but not as much as the actual bite had, Jungkook\u2019s tongue sweeping out to lick over his neck every now and then. It still wasn\u2019t comfortable, but the bite itself had been the most painful thing. It took a surprisingly short time for Jungkook to eventually pull away, his lips stained red with Taehyung\u2019s blood and eyes dark red and hooded. \u201cFuck,\u201d he murmured, leaning down and briefly licking over the open wound, \u201cyou taste really good, now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cY-yeah?\u201d Taehyung whispered, fingers threading through Jungkook\u2019s hair. The vampire groaned, sucked at the wound one last time, and then sat back up. He\u2019d ended up between Taehyung\u2019s legs at some point, and Taehyung was lying if he said the thought of Jungkook between his legs for a completely different reason didn\u2019t turn him on immensely. \u201cYou finished?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nodded, quickly. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t wanna take too much. It would be boring if you ended up lethargic for the rest of the weekend because I couldn\u2019t control my thirst.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung felt himself grin. \u201cWhat a considerate mosquito.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI will punch you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just gave you my <em>blood</em>, Jungkook, be a little nice,\u201d Taehyung huffed. \u201cIt hurt. Take care of me. Be a good fucking boyfriend.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s eyes were suddenly filled with panic. \u201cOh, <em>shit</em>, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 let me just \u2014\u201d the vampire hurriedly leaned over towards the table, grabbing the bottle of ointment and the bandages. He leaned down and licked away any excess blood from Taehyung\u2019s neck \u2014 Taehyung squeaked at this \u2014 and then dripped a bit of the liquid into the wound. The ointment was cooling, but didn\u2019t hurt, seeping into the wounds; Jungkook might have gone a little overboard, applying a little too much. He wrapped Taehyung\u2019s neck with the utmost care, asking every other second how he felt, and when he finished, he pressed a soft kiss to the bandaged wound. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere,\u201d Jungkook muttered, smile sliding onto his lips. \u201cLet me go brush my teeth, and we can make out.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay!\u201d Taehyung grinned. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook paused when he started moving away, eyes widening as he stared down at Taehyung. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Blinking, Taehyung reached up to poke the vampire\u2019s nose. \u201cWhat?\u201d he uttered, feeling more vulnerable under Jungkook\u2019s scrutinizing gaze than he had felt with his teeth in his neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re \u2014\u201d Jungkook bit his lip, \u201cso cute?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou sound surprised? I\u2019m super cute, you\u2019re such a lucky vampire,\u201d Taehyung smiled. \u201cCome on, go wash your mouth. I want kisses. Lots of them.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Jungkook promised, jumping off the couch at an incredible speed. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung <em>did</em> feel a little dizzy, he did, but it was nothing too bad. He had expected a lot worse, and was pleasantly surprised at the aftermath of the whole thing; the wound wasn\u2019t throbbing with pain like the last time Jungkook had bit him, and while it had hurt it hadn\u2019t been unbearable. If Jungkook was speaking the truth about it getting less painful each time, Taehyung was going to consider letting Jungkook drink from him again. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook was back after a full five minutes, having apparently spent a lot of time making sure his mouth was clean and smelled nice and he had no blood on his face. Immediately, he crashed on top of Taehyung, hugging onto him and pressing kisses against his jawline. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Jungkook asked, voice sweet and red eyes gazing at him softly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMhm,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cDid I do good? How\u2019d I taste?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo good,\u201d Jungkook groaned, \u201cman, it\u2019s the best blood I\u2019ve ever had. But I think that\u2019s just because it\u2019s <em>you</em>, you know?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung snorted. \u201cMy blood tastes amazing because you\u2019re in love with me? Really? You\u2019re going to throw away all my hard work at making myself tasty for you, just like that? Give me a little credit.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook just laughed loudly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAlso,\u201d Taehyung added, trying to move the arm that was trapped under Jungkook\u2019s body, \u201cyou\u2019re <em>so</em> fucking heavy. Like \u2014 <em>fuck</em>. Get off me, dead weight.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook grunted, and suddenly Taehyung found himself flipped around, laying top of the vampire\u2019s chest. \u201cThis better?\u201d Jungkook asked softly, and Taehyung hummed as an answer, eyelids drooping as soon as Jungkook started playing with his hair. \u201cYou can rest your eyes a little, I\u2019ll wake you up when I have to change the movie.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet me sleep through two movies and I\u2019ll blow you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c\u2026 fucking <em>deal</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, so, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to ask.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It was 6 AM. Jungkook groaned. \u201cNow?\u201d he mumbled, staring at Taehyung with tired eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Taehyung said. \u201cI\u2019ve seriously been wondering about something.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung sprawled himself all over his naked boyfriend, Jungkook grunting loudly when Taehyung straddled his dick abashedly. \u201cWhat\u2019s a subjugate?\u201d Taehyung asked, curiously; Jungkook blinked in surprise. \u201cNamjoon mentioned it before, and I think you said something about it, too?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Rubbing his eyes, the vampire sat up against the headboard, hands trailing to Taehyung\u2019s waist, and then to his ass. Taehyung wriggled a little on top of him. Yeah, Jungkook was guessing Taehyung wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to sleep without at least one more round. He had showed up expecting a movie marathon, damn it. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 what I was kind of hoping you\u2019d be for me,\u201d Jungkook admitted, as Taehyung leaned down to plant a wet kiss to his mouth. The vampire hummed against his warm lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a human that\u2019s promised to devote themselves to a vampire, so that the vampire will only drink from them. It\u2019s a\u2026 kind of intimate thing, most vampires with human lovers see it as a\u2026 confirmation of their relationship, I guess.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Taehyung uttered, grinding down teasingly. Jungkook hissed. \u201cThat\u2019s cute. Are there lots of vampires who dates humans?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Jungkook grunted, \u201cyou\u2019re really not that special, Tae \u2014 <em>fuck</em>, you really want to fuck <em>again</em>?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung whined. \u201c<em>Yes</em>. It\u2019s the sexy vampire sugar, honey, I can\u2019t help it.\u201d He giggled, and Jungkook couldn\u2019t help but do the same, hands grabbing a little harder at Taehyung\u2019s ass. \u201cBut what do you mean <em>not special</em>? I\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s happened to your short, undead life.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook sighed, tilting his head to connect their lips in a short, sweet kiss. \u201cYou really are.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The human\u2019s cheeks turned a brilliant red at that, as if he hadn\u2019t expected Jungkook to agree. \u201cMh \u2014 so, you want to only drink from me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nodded. \u201cYeah. I was gonna ask about it, eventually, but I guess you beat me to it.\u201d Jungkook trailed kisses down his boyfriend\u2019s jaw, to his neck, breath ghosting over the bandage. They\u2019d changed it once already, and the wound was healing nicely thanks to the ointment, but Jungkook wasn\u2019t about to drink from him again anytime soon, no matter how good he tasted. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a process, though; some magic, a bit of biting, and a very detailed contract. I\u2019m not going to ask you to go through with it unless you \u2014 unless you\u2019re sure you want to stay with me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m already sure of that, but \u2014\u201d Taehyung said, making Jungkook\u2019s cold heart stutter, \u201c\u2014 I guess, I can see where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung stilled a little above him. The mood wasn\u2019t ruined, not really, Jungkook was still horny as fuck right then, but he decided assuring his boyfriend was the best thing \u2014 before they went on with the horizontal tango. \u201cThere is no rush, Taehyung,\u201d he said. \u201cLike \u2014 you don\u2019t have to decide shit like that in years, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll age, though,\u201d Taehyung mumbled. \u201cNot to sound like Bella Swan here, darling, but I really don\u2019t want to be with you when I\u2019m a wrinkly 80-year old.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook laughed heartily. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We have anti-aging potions for a reason. Witches live for centuries thanks to them. Most subjugates don\u2019t get turned unless they really want to, either, you really don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuh.\u201d Taehyung furrowed his brows. \u201cThat\u2019s very convenient.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shrugged. \u201cWitches come up with shit like this all the time; as I said, you\u2019re not the first human to have fallen for a vampire, and anti-aging potions are in high demand. Faeries are also immortal, you know \u2014<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>and you think Jimin is really as young as he looks?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened, and it looked like he was about to ask just how old really Jimin was, but decided against it last second. \u201cYou know what \u2014 I don\u2019t think I want to know. Instead \u2014\u201d the human jumped out of Jungkook\u2019s lap, and Jungkook felt oddly cold for someone who didn\u2019t really react to temperature changes, \u201c\u2014 I\u2019m gonna get some lube. This ass ain\u2019t gonna fuck itself.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook grinned as Taehyung sent him some exaggerated and extremely unsexy fingerguns. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll be here, trying not to fall asleep as the sun rises.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m still gonna ride your dick into the sunrise.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFucking hell, Taehyung.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[to: count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; did you ever ask namjoon about why i could see through your magic? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[from: count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; oh yea</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; he said you probably have ancestors who are witches</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; or shamans</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; nothing extraordinary</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[to: count draculame] </b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; :(((( thats so lame</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; this whole \u201cyou\u2019re not special\u201d is really becoming annoying</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; i wanted to be magic </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>[from: count draculame]</b>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">&gt; the only thing magic about you is your tongue</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">(<strong>bonus!!</strong>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">(\u201cOkay, so \u2014\u201d Taehyung linked arms with Wheein, leading her towards the school gates, \u201c\u2014 I\u2019m definitively in love with \u2014 and dating \u2014 a vampire.

They had both had their last classes today \u2014 Wheein finishing her final hand-ins \u2014 and Taehyung\u2019s best friend was in a considerably better mood than she had been in the last time he tried to pry the Vampire Bullshit (her words, not Taehyung\u2019s) on her. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you got laid?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Taehyung nodded, \u201cnothing dead about his dick.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Grinning, Taehyung pulled her through a mass of crying freshmen. \u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d Taehyung tugged Wheein a little closer. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a vodka bottle to crank open and celebrate, but \u2014 my boyfriend is waiting by the gates, and I know you don\u2019t actually believe he\u2019s a vampire, but it\u2019d mean a lot to me if you\u2019d meet him anyway.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Blinking, Wheein turned towards the school entrance, eyes scanning over the crowd. \u201cIs it the really pale one in a shirt that says \u201c<em>suck it up</em>\u201d?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 definitively him.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Huh</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung eyed her interested expression with suspicion. Jungkook was walking over to them, sunglasses on despite the cloudy, chilly weather, dressed in a sleeveless top and ripped jeans. He looked so <em>good</em>, damn it, but also definitively not dressed for the temperature. \u201c\u2026 what?\u201d Taehyung uttered, when Wheein just continued staring.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m saying this as a lover of tits,\u201d Wheein eventually declared, putting her hands on Taehyung\u2019s shoulders and staring at him seriously, \u201cI\u2019d been offended if you <em>didn\u2019t </em>tap that.\u201d And then she twirled towards the approaching Jungkook, putting on her biggest, dimpled smile; it was brighter than the fucking sun, so Taehyung understood why Jungkook suddenly flinched. \u201cHey!\u201d Wheein greeted. \u201cYou\u2019re the vampire boyfriend!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook hesitated, lifting his sunglasses slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWheein, this is Jungkook. Jungkook, this is my best friend Wheein,\u201d Taehyung introduced them. Jungkook went for a handshake, but Wheein just awkwardly patted Jungkook\u2019s shoulder instead. She was staring a little too intently at Jungkook\u2019s red eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh boy \u2014 lovely meeting you,\u201d Wheein babbled, \u201cTaehyung has told me lots about \u2014 your eyes are <em>super red</em> \u2014 about you, uhh\u2026\u201d She swallowed when Jungkook tryingly smiled at her. \u201cThose are definitively fangs. Great. Fantastic \u2014 uhh, I \u2014 I have a date? Yeah, with like three bottles of soju. Very nice meeting you, Mr. Vampire, please don\u2019t kill Taehyung, like, ever.

She disappeared quickly in the crowd, and Taehyung pouted after her, disappointed at the abrupt leave. \u201cI was going to ask her to eat some food with us,\u201d he complained, \u201cand maybe get a drink. <em>Hmpf</em>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook put an arm over his shoulders, leaning in to kiss Taehyung\u2019s cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t be too upset, Tae. People handle the whole <em>vampires are real</em>\u2014thing in different ways. Let her come to terms with it, and we\u2019ll take her to Bar Soleil when she\u2019s ready.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Huffing again, Taehyung crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cAlright.
