  "text": "<p>So, it didn\u2019t start out like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of <em> The Bat </em>. So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead:<br><br>\u201c <em> The Batman can fly, you know, I\u2019ve seen his wings.\u201d </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At almost twenty, and with a sense of humor so skewed into left field that only an outfielder who could fly would be able to catch, Batman retired that night and went straight to Alfred and asked if his suit could be modified?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred listened to the request, leaning against the computer in the cave under the house. He listened, laughed twice at the absurdity of it all, and said he\u2019d get started on something right away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s how Bruce took to the streets a week later, his simple weighed cape now designed and fitted into something he can hook at his collarbones, and drape down into a true terrifying image of <em> the night.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It actually made some criminals confess on the spot, seeing Bruce in his new cape, they pissed themselves, threw up their hands, and walked to the police station all on their own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred was laughing the whole time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, as one does when encountering a boon, Bruce makes improvements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred was always more of a designer, one that could make an ensemble look terrifying, but Bruce was always more of a <em> practical </em>kind of guy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weighed ends, with some fiberglass ribbing on kevlar sheets, the cape became his most iconic look, covering him in the darkness and just solidifying his appearance of a <em> myth </em> . The people on the streets whispered about meta-humans, about a man with wings that carried him to crime, a man, a <em> bat </em>, a something in between.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was useful for gliding as well, the thumbs unhooking from his collar with a finger twitch, the electromagnet disengaging and allowing the cape, the <em> wings </em> to flare around him catching air and slowing down the fall. When the fighting needed to happen, down and dirty and rough and rumble, the kevlar flare was perfectly fine to drape around his shoulders, but when it needed to the cape hung limp behind him to keep his hands free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Word got around that the Bat didn\u2019t use his wings for fighting, that they hung limp and dead behind him as he tore into the criminals with his bare hands.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now the flare of his cape didn\u2019t scare the criminals nearly as bad as it once did, now that they knew what to expect from it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could probably rig them to snap open\u201d Lucius says one day, looking over designs to improve what will eventually become the final designs of the batmobile, six months after the first cape had been transformed into the appearance of leathery wings. \u201cThe fiberglass fingers he\u2019s sown in there could probably be rigged to move if you do it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce just looked up from the display, eyes catching the glare off Lucius\u2019s glasses in the low light of an office after hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucius mines a punch, a terrible one, \u201cThe Batman, I mean.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce raises a perfectly manicured eyebrow, he discretely moves the designs he was working on over to another tab, and opens up a new whiteboard on his tablet. He passes over both his tablet and his stylus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucius takes both, grinning wide and excited.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prototype only grows from there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With addition after addition, tweak after tweak, the suit grows better with each night out, the kevlar gets replaced with something a little lighter, a little more advanced, a little more flexible, a\u00a0 little stronger. Bruce grows another year, and with time his familiarity with Gotham\u2019s streets grow, as does Gotham\u2019s familiarity with him, the Bat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The criminals whisper about a bat that became man, a man that has the wings of a devil, or something similar. The wings can glide him down long distances now, the grappling hook shoops him up an illusion of flight so seamless that people swear they can hear wingbeats at night when they walk the street.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes people feel safe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce controls everything with gestures, fine tuned sensors across his hands and up the back of his neck, pressed against the base of his skull. A twitch of his pinky flares them wide, enough that he can knock a grown man out when caught by surprise. The thumbs that are normally used to secure the cape to him have hooked claws that can tear and grip, with fine tuned control Bruce has used them to hang onto the sides of buildings. With a simple head tilt he can make them loom, with a twist of his hand he can flatten them tight to his back, a fist makes them slowly rise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The membrane keeps him warm during the winter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <em> almost </em>twenty one when Richard Grayson comes into his life, barely nine years old with wide blue eyes and a weak smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A flying Grayson, <em> grounded </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick, as the little bundles prefers to be called, figures out Bruce is the Batman by following his father down into the cave, hands grasping at the space Bruce should be, slipping down stone steps not made for children to navigate on their own. Dick looks up at the display case that serves as a display for the cowl and frowns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Batman really could fly.\u201d Dick whispers into Bruce\u2019s chest, he\u2019s been scooped up and held tight when he was discovered. \u201cI thought he could <em> fly </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bruce, holding onto a child who's just as lost in this world as he is, makes a <em> promise </em>. A promise to his kid, a promise to the people who paint his symbol across the allies, a promise to the people who think Batman is something a lot more than he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Bruce two months to figure out <em> how </em> to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another four to actually get off the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick watches, wide eyed as always and with glowing, <em> growing </em> glee. Unmasked and unrestrained. Dick Grayson was born to be off the ground, he keeps climbing on things higher than Bruce\u2019s heart can take. He knew it was going to just be a matter of time, but Bruce catches his little menace out and about in his old acrobat uniform, on the streets and with a vibrant coloring against the dark brick of Gotham\u2019s buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick keeps escaping into the night, a brilliant smile as he dances across rooftops, jumps and soars in a way Bruce never did, even with wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin, Dick calls himself, the same name his mother gave him, with his family colors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce tries, he <em> tries </em>, to keep his son safe and warm in their home, to keep Dick off the streets and unscarred.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo keep me grounded!\u201d Dick screams, the echoes of his little yell dance around the very top of the stalagmites in the batcave, he\u2019s looking up at his father with tears in his eyes and his little eyebrows scrunched together so painfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to fly with you!\u201d Dick beats against Bruce\u2019s chest- it\u2019s only midday and they both were exercising in the cave, allowing the thick mats to catch them as they fought and did flexibility exercises, but their talking turned into a discussion which turned into a fight, as it always did when this topic got brought up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce holds Dick close, close against his chest and trying to imprint every bit of this memory into his mind. Bruce knows he can\u2019t win, he can\u2019t hold out against his baby boy like this. This is the moment when Bruce makes his child something unforgivable, something that's just going to be painful and hurt in the long term.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick cries again the very next weekend when Bruce shows him the harness. This time, Robin is going to officially join the team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The harness is simple, it's just like Bruce\u2019s own and is hidden underneath layers of protective armour. It\u2019s not noticeable to a regular eye, and traces down the back, around the chest, over the shoulders and the hips. It\u2019s made to mimic the muscles that neither of them have, they\u2019re not <em> actually </em> birds or bats, no matter what the people in the news are saying, the people on the street. They\u2019re normal humans who have the best cover they possibly can because everyones looking for a man with bat-wings who has taken in a fledgling with wings of red, gold, and green.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s lighter, smaller, able to go farther and fly higher. Agile in the air like Bruce can\u2019t comprehend or mimic. Dick jumps off buildings like he was made to, he\u2019ll jump off people and into the sky with a manic gleeful scream. The people who watch a child spread his wings and <em> jump </em> panic for a moment or two, but they quickly realize that this <em> Robin </em> is no slouch. A quick menace who is just as likely to kick you in the face as look at you, Robin dances on the ground and in the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grows, Dick does, and so do his wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They go from a simple feathery design to a more complex one, short flight feathers for maneuverability, adding a tail soon into the mix for better control. Blades get added to the primary flight feathers, the first few get full length ones but the inner primaries just get additions to the very tips- not all of them blades either. Some get a few <em> surprises </em> that make the criminal population of Gotham think twice. Batman\u2019s own wings get more dexterity, their membrane gets thinner, allowing a longer wingspan, and Dick paints the inner membrane a yellow to black ombre on a day off school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s very little to confirm that they even exist in the media, all of the so-called pictures are just grainy blobs of fast moving objects. The only people who can give any kind of real <em> description </em>are the ones who have a VIP fast pass to Arkham- all they do is rant and rave about clipping those damnable wings. No newspaper worth anything is printing what they preach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to picture Dick with the Robin wings than without.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their fighting style evolves in strange ways, from the weight and balance. Their reach is astronomically long now, the sensors in their suits grow more and more nuanced, they have an entire sign language system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More strange people emerge around the world, some meta, some gods, some aliens. Some a mixture. Superman is something untouchable given human form, technology from space seems almost like magic sometimes, hell there\u2019s <em> actual magic </em> in some cases. The freaks sometimes help one another out, vigilantism patching together and very solidly ignoring the law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a few meetups in Gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s not stupid, if there\u2019s something he can\u2019t hande he\u2019ll absolutely contact somebody else whos dressing up in pyjama\u2019s and breaking the law on a nightly basis. Sometimes, it\u2019s easy enough to send an encrypted email to whatever hero needed it. That caused some paranoia early on. Apparently it was \u2018rude\u2019 to just reveal identities through deduction and then help them out with some information.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anybody figured out who Bruce was and helped him out with information, Bruce would probably let the guy be on his team- it\u2019s a wicked series of leaps and bounds to figure out his own identity, or if Robin and him are even real or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick loves meeting new people, getting to smile wide at the strangers who swing by and occasionally help- or occasionally need help. There\u2019s whispers about a gathering of heroes like this, an overviewing force to look after the whole planet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce thinks about it, but right now everything\u2019s just a little too new, a little too fresh. It\u2019ll be a while before people get used to this new world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBatman.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman tucks Robin against him, the man is thinner than Clark would have thought, tall though. He stretches over his child like a moth to the flame, the child goes happily into the waiting wings of his father, giggling slightly as he does so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark tries not to make it a habit to come and visit them, these two particular brand of meta-humans protect their nest like it\u2019s been beaten into them to do so. The Batman is named aptly, Clark took one look at the guy and nearly bolted back to Metropolis the first time they had encountered one another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man looks like something out of an old horror movie, all bluff and buster and deadly. The wings aren\u2019t something that look inviting, or even very comfortable on this blustering cold night in the middle of January.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But they look wickedly beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark hates himself for thinking that, but when the man strands before him, holding onto his child like a little fledgling and tucking the Robin into the folds of his wings on a dark rooftop overlooking Gotham city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuperman.\u201d Batman responds back in kind, head dipping in greeting. The leathery bat-wings move with him as natural as breathing, there\u2019s armor on them, around the fore-arms and across his shoulders, the paneling tight around vulnerable spots in the man\u2019s physique. Superman can see the spots where tears and rips have been repaired throughout the wings- scars only barely hidden and healed underneath a covering of yellow faded paint. \u201cWhat brings you to Gotham?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman sets down on the roof, letting gravity hold him down to earth. His own cape feels light as it brushes against his knees, is it rude to have a cape on when talking to winged men? Neither of them have capes- well Robin does, but it covers his back and attaches to the boy's tail. Batman\u2019s wings are just like a bats, they\u2019re wide and attach all the way down to his knees, no cape needed to protect him from the elements or to keep him hidden away in the darkness. The thumbs hold onto one another right at the base of his throat, the sharp talons are dipped in some kind of metal, they reflect in the low light of Gotham's Streetlights, hooked together like some strange mimicry of a pinkie-swear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten word that Luthor\u2019s getting shipments from your docks.\u201d Superman literally overheard it during lunch, he was irritated to be interrupted while Louis and him were having a bitch session.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman sighs, just a minute reaction, but the slight relaxing of his shoulders means that Robin can wiggle free of his fathers grasp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin always smells faintly of dye and excitement, sometimes soft warm leather that his father leaves on his boy when Robin bursts out of Batman\u2019s grasp. The little kiddo has <em> got </em>to dye his wings in a vain attempt to keep his identity safe, like Batman coloring the ends of his inner wing a yellow and coating everything else in a matte black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin barrels into Superman\u2019s knees, hugging tightly around Superman\u2019s waist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf <em> course </em>Luthor is.\u201d Batman\u2019s still hovering close to his ward, but he\u2019s not stanced up for a fight anymore, it\u2019s as relaxed as Superman ever sees the man. \u201cAnything dangerous on those shipments?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust guns.\u201d Superman confirms, he ruffles Robin's hair, careful not to touch anywhere near the kiddo\u2019s back. Last time Clark had clapped a hand on a shoulder a little too close to his wing <em> both </em> of Gotham\u2019s vigilanties had frozen solid and Clark had to beat a hasty retreat before the two of their hearts had gone back to normal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman sighed, motioned Robin back to himself with a twitch of his large leather wings, the fingers flaring straight for just a millisecond before relaxing back into their naturally tight state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin disengages, giggling. \u201cBye Uncle Kal!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid\u2019s wings flare in perfect time with his fathers as the two take off from the sloped Gotham roof. While Batman\u2019s wingspan is breathtaking, Robin still looks to be growing into his, half the length but with twice the flare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark waves to them as they go check out the information given to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark tries to be respectful and not to stare as Batman uses his body to the ultimate of its abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark \u2026 is going to have to try that whole \u201c<em>not</em> <em>starting</em>\u201d thing another day.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman forms the justice league with Wonder Woman and Superman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t correct them when they begin his introductions with <em> \u201cBatman, metahuman </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick keeps up the acrobatics -even without the winged additions- enhancing them, teaching Bruce new tricks in and out of the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two of them dominate Gotham for four long years. Dick\u2019s almost fourteen, turning so in a few weeks, when a little spitfire tries to steal the tires right off the batmobile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy is slip thin, shoulders too broad for his body and his ears sticking out to match. Wild curly dark hair- black in the grimy back streets of gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce takes him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not as Batman, god no, Bruce makes sure that little Jason Todd gets sent to a good school for troubled children.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t go well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce keeps updates on the kid, a small section of screen on the batcomputer is constantly checking up on how that little spitfire is doing. He\u2019s abrasive, full of a heart of white hot gold. Dick notices, because how could he <em> not </em> . Dick goes in and out of the troubled scoool checking up on it, shutting down more criminal startups but simply <em> existing </em> in the same space- the school was sketchy as all hell but with frequent visits they kept themselves in line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has red hair, when he\u2019s under fluorescent lights.\u201d Dick tells Bruce. \u201cDark red, almost black. When you just look at him, but under those visiting lights his hair is so <em> red </em> B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce wheezes, softly. He doesn\u2019t need to know this about the kid. He doesn\u2019t need to know that there\u2019s a child out there who can use his help. A child out there who could flourish under the tutelage of both Dick and himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick laughs at Bruce, at the efforts. \u201cJust adopt him, <em> jeeze </em>.\u201d Dick\u2019s hanging upside down on his gymnastics equipment, harness on to get used to a new rig. The specialized feathers are made to hold a new weight and be used for a new range of mobility. Undyed yet- still that off white color. There\u2019s blades in there, sharp and new, ready to cut through the armor of Gothamite villains. With the undyed synthetic feathers the shine of the metal shows through easily- too bright- much too bright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d Bruce says, he\u2019s working on kata\u2019s without the suit on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick just tilts his head, his face isn\u2019t even red no matter how long he hangs upside down. He looks like a strange owl, his hair all messy like this. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce gestures all around him, the cave, the secrets they live in. \u201cYou\u2019re my son, I can\u2019t just \u2026 I can\u2019t just <em> grab </em> another one. It would be unfair to you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It turns out, yes you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason is ten, when Bruce adopts him. Takes him from that school who was definitely up to something underhanded and brings him home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick was right, he does have red hair under the right lights- the harsh fluorescent of the government building where they sign adoption papers at and through a pure sunny day in the gardens of the manor- but the paparazzi flashes show him as \u201c<em> the second black haired son </em>\u201d of a billionaire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes to it like a duck to water, the books he has access to, the schooling and tutors and stability. There\u2019s the initial stumbling period of mistrust but there\u2019s nothing like walking home after a long day at the office and seeing Dick and Jason doing handstands in the front hall- laughing at one another and trying to kick the other down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, like his brother before him, Jason takes a too-close look at the grandfather clock in the study and tumbles down the secret system of twinding tunnels that are easier to get lost in than to navigate correctly to the bottom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He catches Dick and Alfred down there, Jason catches Dick who\u2019s been benched for a leg injury but who\u2019s still leaned over the feathers of the Robin suit, touching up the places where the dye has lost its vibrancy over the weeks of Gotham\u2019s back alley adventuring. Hands covered in a dark green as Dick gets into his gear repair. Alfred is taking great care in meding and polishing the batarangs, making sure that when his charge and his grandson do truly reckless things at night they have equipment that won\u2019t fail them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason screams, loud and bone-chilling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also runs forward, uncaring that the cave floor is slick and slippery and not meant for running, His brain is trying to piece together that his brother is Robin- which makes his father Batman- but those two have <em> wings </em> and they\u2019re <em> angels </em>-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tackles Dick, crying, because he doesn\u2019t understand. Alfred tries to calm the boy down, to instill some sense back into his mind. Jason can\u2019t hear it, it\u2019s such a jarring revelation. He thinks that somehow, someway, Robin has lost his wings, forever grounded. There\u2019s nothing worse than this, Robin\u2019s magic, Robin\u2019s an angel that\u2019s blessed Gotham in it\u2019s darkest time. If there\u2019s no Robin anymore then-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason, red faced and blotchy with his too wide shoulders and his ears that stick out, <em> cries </em>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce comes in early for the night, because of a frantic call by his oldest telling him he needed to come back <em> now </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman comes in so fast that the batmobile isn\u2019t even through stopping before Bruce is ripping out, running to grab ahold of his baby boy and comfort him. He doesn\u2019t have the words, the perfect parental soothing speech, all Bruce can do is grip Jason tightly and hug the boy till he stops shaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soft explanations, soft words, Bruce can\u2019t get any gentler but he wishes he could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason demands to be able to help.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce says <em> no </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child.\u201d Bruce tries, pleads, holds Jason\u2019s calloused hands in his own on the cold stone cave floor while dressed up in a glorified halloween costume. He is aware of this irony. He doesn\u2019t flinch when it\u2019s pointed out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDick\u2019s hurt.\u201d Jason points out, infuriatingly calm when normally he\u2019s so easy to rile up. Blotchy red still in the face from his tears. \u201cHe\u2019s also a kid- he was <em> younger </em> than me when he started.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce inhales, he\u2019s mentally counting to five-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso you can\u2019t <em> stop </em>me, B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mentally counting to <em> ten </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick is very wisely not saying a damn thing, he has been moved to the time-out chair for not <em> locking the cave </em> correctly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Bruce breaks in less time than it took him for Dick, mostly because within two hours of being asked not to crimefight Jason\u2019s stolen from the old costume case and is wiggling into an old pair of Dick\u2019s wings that have been long since hung up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTeach me <em> how </em> Dickie.\u201d Jason demands, he\u2019s climbing onto the obstacle course with no regards to his own safety. Dick is having heart palpitations watching another member of his family attempt to soar with no safety net.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Get down!\u201d Curse a lucky knife, getting Dick right under his knee. He can\u2019t follow Jason up there, he can\u2019t keep the little bastard <em> safe </em>. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking idiot!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason rolls his eyes, and Dick\u2019s going to <em> really </em>kill him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to work them!\u201d Dick is hobbling over as fast as he can to the foam pits that sit beneath the flight range.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTeach me!\u201d Jason <em> jumps </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick fishes his stupid idiot brother out of the foam square pit- cursing at him the whole time the both of them are flailing about trying to get back to solid ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They come to an agreement- Jason stays down for the day so that Dick can teach him <em> on the ground </em> how to control the mechanisms that control it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce ignores it, he <em> does, </em> he tells Jason not to fight crime, he allows his children their fun in the cave as long as they keep safe and stay over the foam pits for safety. Alfred monitors them when they\u2019re both in the cave, a watchful guardian. Dick\u2019s leg heals, and because his children want to cause as many problems as they <em> possibly can </em> all while giving Bruce grey hairs over it as soon as Dick\u2019s cleared for normal levels of activity again <em> both </em> of the little assholes are pushing one another to do tricks that are flashy and dangerous and\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Admittedly, a little cool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, a lot of cool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bruce already has a Robin, he can\u2019t justify it to the city about getting a <em> second child </em> into this mess. Gordon already gives him strange looks when Robin trails along after him, hiding in Batman\u2019s cape, right under the membrane and peaking out whenever there\u2019s a break in conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin says it keeps him warm, hidden up under there, but Bruce knows better. The synthetic feathers keep in heat just as well as the membrane, the cold unyielding winters of Gotham\u2019s coastal bay get icey and into the negatives, so Bruce isn\u2019t going to oppose some quality closeness with his older son. Even as the time goes by and what was once an easy fit, hiding Robin away in his wings, now that Dick is bigger the maneuver to encase him in Batman\u2019s safety gets more and more technical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soon enough, Dick grows out of the mantle of being Robin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for it.\u201d Dick says, almost truthfully, Bruce can see the strain of teenage rebellion around the corners of his eyes, the way that they keep disagreeing while on the field. Dick\u2019s not fifteen yet but he\u2019s not in his fathers shadow anymore, not all the way escaped from it yet but <em> getting there </em>. Edging closer and closer to the light to be his own thing, his own experience, his own hero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t want to let him go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick leaves, for New York, for the newly formed Titans, for his own life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing takes to the streets with black and blue wings, vibrant colors on the underside, pale and inviting and blue in a way Robin wasn\u2019t. Stripes of light flashing clear sky underneath the inky darkness of night. Jason dumps black glitter into the wings before Bruce gifts them to him-spreads it out while the black dye is still drying so that the wings shine like stars when nightwing takes to the streets of Bludhaven for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing laughs, laughs and laughs when he sees them. Because he inherited his sense of humor from Bruce and the image of a bunch of bad guys trying to get <em> glitter </em> out of their hair is just too good to pass up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick still comes home, but not nearly as often anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The press speculate why the older teenager isn\u2019t under Bruce\u2019s direct care anymore. Not a soul in Wayne Manor comments on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason asks, cautiously over the phone one night while talking to his older brother, if he can be the Robin in Gotham now. Please, <em> please </em> . Robin\u2019s needed, he\u2019s an angel, Robin has to dart across the streets and show the people that there\u2019s still <em> hop </em> e <em> . </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sour taste in Dick\u2019s mouth, overlooking New York, overlooking Bludhaven, overlooking a position that he thought was his and his alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick doesn\u2019t like it, but says <em> yes </em>anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s already been practicing for months, has taken self defense lessons from both Bruce and Dick and even Alfred when called for it. Jason had none of the acrobatic skill that his older brother did, none of the innate flexibility or the bravery for high flying jumps. Jason was better at brute force, straightforward thinking, and sheer tenacity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cN never broke his wings like this.\u201d Batman says, exasperated and amazed all at once. \u201cHow do you keep <em> breaking </em> them?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin shrugs, one wing hangs limp and awkward on one side and the other expresses so flawlessly it's almost like he really was born with wings. He hisses, the wing has sensors that attach to multiple places on them, when something is wrong it lets out small electric snaps to let the wearer know what exactly was weak or broken with the wing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mad Hatter sits with handcuffs on, half asleep due to the knockout gas. He had gotten two good hits on Robin before Robin had punched the man into unconsciousness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sighs, and crouches down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Jason\u2019s wings out of commission, he\u2019s a grounded bird. Dick didn\u2019t break his own method of flight nearly as often- not that he didn\u2019t break the things once or twice- but Jason seemed to shatter the bones in his wings on a bi-monthly basis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes the hint, he\u2019s done it enough times that it\u2019s not new anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tries to fold the wings, but it's a loss cause, he just gets more notifications across his palms that the wings are compromised and not to try and let them hold weight. He lets out another hiss, the sensors must be truly going nuts if he\u2019s this affected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman stays completely still as tiny hands grasp ahold of his back. Jason hisses and whines the whole time- Mad Hatter had hit Robin\u2019s collar bone pretty bad, it might be broken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason climbs aboard, slipping his hands around his fathers throat and tucking his knees up into Bruce\u2019s sides the little bird fits like a glove into the divot between Bruce\u2019s shoulder blades, flattened down and carried easily. It\u2019s a maneuver that\u2019s good for holding onto his little fledglings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They fly away, jumping into the night after sending out an alert to the police to come pick up Hatter from where he lay in an abandoned apartment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hatter takes a note, thinking about how the little bird had screamed when Hatter had taken a cane to his collar bone- winced and hissed and limped into the big bat's arms. The break had been clean across the wing, Hatter had been sure of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had incapacitated the boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hatter tells a tale in Arkham, about how \u2026 <em> delicate </em> a little bird's bones were.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t often that Clark gets to team up with Batman like this, the full force of all three metahumans from Gotham arriving to help out the teams of heroes to save the earth from some kind of wild threat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s always stiff in the presence of other heroes he\u2019s not as familiar with. He keeps his wings around him like a safety blanket, like the world's strangest kind of cape. The wings twitch and move and sways with B\u2019s breath and motion, it\u2019s like black living velvet draped across a man who\u2019s pure controlled grace. The man's heartbeat doesn\u2019t move a hair above forty-five beats a minute unless one of his children gets a little too close to danger. Robin still isn\u2019t used to being around anybody but his family, so he sticks close to Batman</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s still not a full adult yet, but he\u2019s older than the little Robin. He stomps into the watchtower off of the javelin with excited glee. When the three of them are called they all huddle close, pressed into one another's plumage and speaking a language Clark can\u2019t even begin to comprehend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let alone <em> speak </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing still rushes forward, something in his chest giggling low and soft and jumps onto Clarks shoulders- \u201cUncle Kal!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy is black and blue now, with those same short quick wings that make him impossible to catch mid-air. There\u2019s a new dye pattern, midnight ink black which caught the light and shimmered iridescent and a midsky blue streaked through it. The black feathers seem to \u2026 \u201cAre you covered in <em> glitter </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin laughs, nothing at all like his older brother's little giggles, but full on physical belly laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Duh yeah </em>.\u201d Nightwing flares his wings, showing off his vibrant colors. \u201cExtra fine!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also <em> covers Clark with glitter </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEugh!\u201d Clark isn\u2019t that put off by it- he\u2019s known Nightwing for years now and this is by far not the first kind of stunt pulled by the little prankster. There\u2019s not that much glitter that falls from Nightwings wings, a majority of it sticks to the feathers and keeps the shimmering star effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin gets attacked much the same way as Clark did, with Nightwing rushing over all at once in a bundle of limbs and feathers. Robin has wings that are a little bigger than Nightwings were at that age, they\u2019re longer, thinner, made for endurance flight. Dyed in a similar way to Nightwings old color scheme, a paler yellow underside to a red and green flashy display on the backs. Matching no known color of any natural bird.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark \u2026 did a lot of research on bats after his first few times he met Batman. The research on birds was mostly asking google at 3 am if bats had a habit of adopting outside of their own species.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bats do\u00a0 sometimes adopt isolated or abandoned babies from their colony, if you were curious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the other members of the Justice League whispered in low tones that Batman had taken in two birds who were kicked out of their nests, so to speak. Parents didn\u2019t want to keep metahumans, especially ones that have such visible mutations, it's highly likely that the two boys had been abandoned and Batman snatched them up, hiding them away under his wing to let them grow up loved. They\u2019re similar looking, the boys are, but not in a way that could indicate any real close relation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman still taps the tips of their tails to get them to lay off of one another, to stop trying to lightly maim one another, Nightwing and Robin respond immediately to their father\u2019s physical gestures, reaching out with their own primaries and pressing them to both Batman and each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark spots the knives that they have hidden away along the feather\u2019s spine, thin razor sharp blades used for utility and defense when the boys spread their primaries. Batman doesn\u2019t have anything like that so visible, just the gleam of metallic claw covers at his throat. There\u2019s sleeping venom laced on that metal, and Clark wants to see those claws in action, just once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also might want to climb up the Batman like a tree and see how warm it really is in the man's embrace, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright it might be here and there but Clarks is going to be <em> professional </em> about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mission requires both stealth and an isolated island off the coast of some small country in the caribbean. The island has kryptonite weapons- stolen right under Luthor's nose-, and only wants to relax its anti-aircraft missiles when they can visibly see Wonder Woman on the news. It means it's a great, well, absolute most <em> ideal </em> mission to send somebody like Batman and his brood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The flights are going to be long, longer than gliding around and short little flights in Gotham are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearly an hour by <em> plane </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark feels terrible asking them, but it\u2019s essential to stop a deranged scientist trying to make phones turn against the general population and drave people mad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman answers with no hesitation to how <em> long </em> he can fly for- \u201cThree hours, non sustained. I\u2019ve never tried continuous streamlined flight before.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both Nightwing and Robin look nervous, they glance at one another for not even a second before they go back to perfectly still statues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can make guesses, Batman\u2019s wings aren\u2019t made for long overseas flight like Robin\u2019s are shaping up to be- bats have a whole different way of moving compared to birds- they\u2019re much better at quick sharp turns and ducking around foliage, Batman can\u2019t fly as long due to injuries, Batman is telling the league his absolute limit for flight, there\u2019s a whole host of options that Clark can think of. It\u2019s terrible to assume something in this line of business, however.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a whole lot more economical to ask the boys later on, when they\u2019re not in Batman's direct line of sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing likes to talk, to chat, and to mingle with other heroes. It doesn\u2019t take long before Nightwing has darted off into somewhere to talk to his friends- the ones that he doesn\u2019t get to see that often due to distance. Robin\u2019s a little harder to separate from his boss, since Robin\u2019s still young, young enough that the older heroes look at both him <em> and </em> Batman with barely concealed scorn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the founding members of the League don\u2019t think it's right for Robin to be in a cape and tights. They question Batman\u2019s integrity for allowing the kid so close to danger at all. The\u00a0 initial Robin has led the way for more and more \u2018Boy Wonders\u2019 to start popping up- some heroes are <em> very </em> against it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark has to admit he\u2019s done the same sometimes, asking himself why he still gravitates towards a mysterious meta who won\u2019t show his face, won\u2019t tell anybody his name, and won\u2019t even relax enough to take off his gauntlets at the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Batman does something stupid and self sacrificing and lonely. He\u2019ll say something that makes something just creep into his voice, his scent, and it makes Clark want to walk over and embrace the man. Tell Batman that he\u2019s not alone in this thing anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can just pull on his own memories of being different and scared when he was still growing up, and that was all with a normal looking exterior.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing that would obviously or outwardly make him a unique or nonuniform human mould. Clark\u2019s got a little bit of hiding to do when his joints don\u2019t move or line up exactly like a human's should, when his pupils are hexagons instead of circles, but there\u2019s nothing like a winged individual would experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman finally does leave his Robin to his own devices, Batman has to talk shop with Diana- about making sure Wonder Woman is on a TV appearance at the same time that Batman\u2019s trying to do the infiltration, all while making sure that Robin is safe here in the watchtower while him and Nightwing did the mission- so Robin gets left with the computers to toy with and Clark to talk too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, there were other supers to talk too, but there\u2019s also the fact that Clark wants Plastic Man <em> nowhere near </em> a child. Hawk Girl was okay, but was also more apt to give Robin a mace than actually talk to him, J\u2019onn was with Diana and Batman in the war room, Green Lantern was here somewhere, but also wanted to avoid talking to anybody under 30 like the plague.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s just Clark, Shazam, and Robin overlooking the watchtower's observation deck. Shazam is the one technically on duty right now, but Robin sits in the seat rather awkwardly and looks around the whole world with satellites.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through the lenses, one can just barely see the outer ring of Gotham\u2019s vigilante\u2019s irises. It\u2019s the only way to possibly track where any of the three Gothamites are looking, and even then it\u2019s sometimes not a good indicator depending on the light. Robin\u2019s eyes dart all over the place, constantly trying to watch the world below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThree hours, is that a time you can match?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin looks from the window to Superman. \u201cYeah? Nightwing too. It\u2019s our maximum time limit though, we always stay within two hours to be safe.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s trained you all to have a maximum flight limit?\u201d Shazam\u2019s got one hand on his hip and it's cocked out. Leaning against the console like you\u2019re <em> not </em>meant to. Shazam and Flash tend to lean on buttons pretty much all the time, even if it\u2019s against watchtower rules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin just looks confused, the flexible mask polymer follows the line of his eyebrow as he scrunches them up. \u201cUh, what?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shazam shrugs awkwardly \u201cIsn\u2019t that kinda- Doesn\u2019t that make Batman sound like-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA total dictator?\u201d Robin\u2019s smirk is back now, the kid leans as far back in the chair as he possibly can with his wings hanging over the side. Clark lets the kiddo go as far back as he can, it\u2019s nothing like his older brother and Nightwing\u2019s habits of physically trying to do handstands on the furniture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The shine of the earth makes it so that the entire room is cast in a soft, warm light, it\u2019s as dark as it gets in the observation room and the massive lights they use for gatherings have been turned off to save on power. It\u2019s a quiet moment between three people, with all the illusion of privacy and safety that comes with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin sighs, a smile on his face, \u201cIt\u2019s to keep us safe. I\u2019ve fallen out of the air more times than I can count. I run out of steam mid-jump and I fall to my death. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark tries his best not to wince, it\u2019s reality but Batman could sugar coat it a little bit to his kids. Robin clearly sees the facial expression his \u2018Uncle Kal\u2019 makes and rockets to a picture perfect posture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as we make it look like, you don\u2019t probably realize because both of you can just sit suspended but it takes a lot of training to get up in the air! It\u2019s all about wing loading\u2019 and aspect ratio- god the lectures i\u2019ve heard about that- We have to make our own lift when we\u2019re not ridin around Gotham and that's just even more draining-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shazam throws his hands up- \u201cWoah woah! It\u2019s okay we\u2019re not accusing you of anything here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s accent comes out when he gets heated, Jersey streets through and through. \u201cSounds to me like you don\u2019t trust none of us to realize the limitations of our own equipment.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t refer to yourself as <em> \u2018equipment\u2019 </em>dude, it makes you sound so weird.\u201d Shazam and Robin are now one on one, totally ignoring that Clark is even in the same room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two of them seem to talk in circles for a while or two, Shazam trying to get Robin to admit that maybe Batman trains him a little too hard while Robin\u2019s holding on to his own ground on the fact that if he wasn\u2019t as prepared as Batman's training made him then he\u2019d be dead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have powers like you.\u201d Robin says so carefully, like he\u2019s trying not to yell. \u201cTo make it as heroes Nightwing, Batman and I need to work, like, three times as hard.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have wings!?\u201d Shazam gestures to the way the two feathered limbs skew over the handrests and push feathers out of their place and into an disarray.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that statement, the door to the war room opens, and Batman steps back out into play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s preparing the final equipment check before the mission, Jason helps with the sensor check by using his own wings to press against parts that make the haptic feedback buzz against Dick\u2019s back. There\u2019s twenty four sensors from the back of his neck all the way down and across his shoulders, four on each palm, and two that sit right underneath his pectorals. Each one of them will give haptic buzzes that vary in pressure and when the area has been broken or unusable they send out small ignorable shocks- literally repurposed from a children's toy- every ten seconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re charged up and ready to go- the wings are- they\u2019re made to last three hours on a portable battery that\u2019s hidden underneath the down on a person\u2019s back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason does the calibration testing quick as ever, flashing out with his own wings, his own arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It looks like a spar to the outside observer, a flare and flash of capes and feathers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Dickward.\u201d Jason asks as he slams his primaries against Dicks\u2019 own. The name is as much of an insult as it is a quick way to get Dicks attention. It\u2019s also the only part of that sentence spoken in english. Bruce is having them work on Mongolian and Thai this week. Jason has an atrocious accent. \u201cI had an interesting conversation today.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick blocks with his own hidden blades, the haptic on his right lower shoulder buzzes, level three of five. \u201cOh? I\u2019ve had interesting conversations too. Did you hear the hottest gossip?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason huffs, and twirls, lashing out with a kick which Dick braces with the forewing. Palm, upper pinky side, level four of five, Jason\u2019s getting stronger in those kicks of his. Good for him. \u201cI heard that Shazam thinks we <em> actually </em>have wings.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason also\u2019s getting better at his Mongolian, good for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait a fucking second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShazam thinks <em> what </em>.\u201d Dick\u2019s too surprised, he goes back to his native Romani instead of the Thai he was speaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For that, Jason flashes out a kick to Dick\u2019s shins. Dick takes it, that's the punishment for forgetting what they\u2019re meant to be speaking in- a free shot for whoever hears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy- for some reason- thinks that we <em> actually have wings </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick doesn\u2019t know what the hell Jason\u2019s on about. \u201cWhat the <em> fuck </em> do you mean.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Jason and Dick have a good laugh together. Jason explains, in great detail, and Dick can\u2019t keep his giggles contained. It explains so much, like why the entire Justice League was so damn worried about whether or not Nightwing would \u2018make the trip\u2019 or not. Why nobody ever seemed to ask them about how cool their technology in their capes were, <em> why everybody is always so careful </em> when talking to Dick or Jason. It's hilarious, it's somehow nearly impossible to comprehend. \u201cWe\u2019ve <em> got </em> to have taken off the capes some time or another.\u201d Dick gasps laughing. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they <em> actually </em> assume we\u2019re the same as Hawkman or something, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turns out, the Justice League actually truly believes that the vigilantes of Gotham are metahumans. That the wings they wear aren\u2019t just fancy accessories for a billionaire's crime fighting spree. Uncle Clark and Aunt Diana, who come to talk to Batman, Robin, and Nightwing about having a carrier to the midway point of the mission before letting Batman and Nightwing fly on their own, confirm it when Dick asks some very specific questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick looks at Batman, eyes wide and amazed behind special concealing lenses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce has gone stock still, carefully holding himself in a way that Dick can recognize as surprise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Back at the batcave, after a successful mission in which the worst injury was a broken index finger from Bruce, the man actually loses his entire shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick is heaving with the laughter of keeping it in the entire time. Jason is screaming about how nobody <em> knew </em> , how Batman was <em> so secretive </em> that people assumed that the three of them were-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMeta-human!\u201d Jason screeches to the ceiling. \u201cThey think that we\u2019re not all just regular guys! They think that we have powers! How are we going to be cooler than Green Arrow, <em> if nobody compares us! </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce just laughs harder, the bastard that he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey oughta <em> know </em> how much effort we put into this!\u201d Jason fails his arms, gesturing to the haptics that are still across his entire torso. The cape, when taken off, gets taken off in three parts- the wings, the tail, and the thin shirt of haptics underneath. Batman\u2019s cape has a little bit of a difference, being that his wings are based on, well, <em> bats </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s taken off the whole costume, he\u2019s just in an after save-the-world ensemble that\u2019s soft and easy to wear. Comfort all the way. The undersuit is comfortable, sure, but it\u2019s definitely got electronics in it and isn\u2019t washed as often as it <em> should be </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The three of them can\u2019t even believe it, that the League has been under such an assumption for the entire time they\u2019ve known each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, also, none of the Gotham vigilantes want to <em> reveal </em> that they\u2019ve been inadvertently lying to \u2026 well ... <em> everybody </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes a nosedive close to Joker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Too close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Joker\u2019s grabbed him, dragging kicking and screaming into the darkness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing Jason does is activate the emergency beacon, then the second one, then the third one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wrist watch gets taken immediately, Joker rips it from him with a cry of manic glee. The magnetic clasp on the watch doesn\u2019t give way easily, or immediately, but Joker still manages to tear the metal and make Jason bleed. The second beacon is the communicator, which is torn from his ear with vengeance- ow, by the way. There was a reason that every member of the Wayne family had an earring, and now that the com link has been torn from his very delicate cartilage he\u2019s gonna have to put the damn thing in his <em> left </em> ear while his right one heals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The third was the only one not found.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because the third emergency beacon was right at the base of Jason\u2019s spine, hidden away by both feathers, down, a battery, a backup emergency air supply, and haptic buzzers. It\u2019s a patch of nearly invisible plastic that echoes his exact location to Batman, to Bruce, to <em> anybody </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reason why it wasn\u2019t found is that Harley, when searching him for them, didn\u2019t want to fully undress a fourteen year old \u201c<em> freak \u2018a nature </em> \u201d. Joker also claimed all rights to little Robin\u2019s wings, forbidding anybody else to lay a <em> damned hand </em>on them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joker breaks his right leg, then the left. Tibias, not fibias. Thank god for small miracles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One femur, his left one, Joker wasn\u2019t strong enough to shatter his right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harely left at day two of the torture, she only threw up twice. Pussy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joker then skipped his torso completely, the mad man jumped right to the place where the stiff bone of the cape came from his shoulder, The deranged villain went right into a rant, a tirade rant about the <em> Batman </em> and <em> mortal enemies </em> and <em> arch nemesis </em> and all other kinds of maniacal bullshit. Joker also threw in a good few lines about airline food.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While beating Jason\u2019s skull in, for a treat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because he was crazy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Joker traveled up the cape\u2019s lightweight ribbing- the \u2018<em> bones </em>\u2019 so to speak. He broke the material in pieces and bits, shattering it under a crowbar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason made sure to give out little whimpers whenever the man seemed like he needed some confirmation he was doing a real good job of the whole \u2018break Robin\u2019 thing. The pain was excruciating, yes, but it was also just confined to his legs, which could be ignored with very specific mental willpower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After four days of nonstop pain, Bruce barrelled through the ceiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick grabs Jason with no hesitation, Nightwing is in through a window, scooping up his younger brother, and back out again in seven seconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s benched from Robin, he\u2019s wheelchair bound for the next half year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s mad about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got to go through PT as well after that, so he\u2019s not going to be Robin for a long while yet. A grounded bird.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everybody knows it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The villains don\u2019t try a <em> damn thing </em> after Jason\u2019s been brought home. Safely cradled in Nightwings arms, a <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842872003412623360/898808342363930695/DickJasonFakesWings.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">photograph</a> had been leaked onto the internet, from someplace high in the streets, of Nightwing holding onto a bird with broken wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The picture is beautiful, in a way that\u2019s horrific. A visage of war, of an avenging angel in black and blue with a father\u2019s wrath behind him caked in glorious golden flames. Wings spread, flared, dark and dangerous with those blue streaks turned red in the lighting of the explosion behind him. Hair flared out, sparkling the same kind of starry night as the reflecting specks in his wings. Nightwing looks like death, like Lucifer falling from grace on wings of black midnight starry skies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s crying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin lays in his arms, limp and broken, fallen open with his throat thrown back and exposed. The wings of pale gold flare out around him like a halo of purity, like the magic has been seeped from his bones, from his feathers. There\u2019s blood on the bottom of those pale golden feathers, splattered from crowbar hits, the suits ripped and torn and underneath it all is just a boy, both of them are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The photo is beautiful, breathtaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t give anything away. It\u2019s dark enough that no details in either boy's face are shown, just their postures, their sorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only confirmed picture of any one of the three vigilantes of Gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody <em> dares </em> commit a crime in Gotham for nearly a week after the release, the leak, of the photograph. They\u2019ve all heard the state in which Joker was returned to Arkham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The clown\u2019s <em> alive </em>, and that\u2019s about all he has going for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick runs back to Bludhaven, he\u2019s back nearly every night to sit outside of Jason\u2019s door and listen to his brother breathe. Just to make sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce patrols every night anyway, with a vengeance almost unheard of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s killing himself, taking rises that he shouldn\u2019t be, ruthlessly pursuing anybody who comes <em> close </em> to hurting another human being.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t sleep, but sometimes he sits with Dick at Jason\u2019s door when the sun\u2019s just beginning to rise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason decides to be productive, and uses his newfound time in the day to both track down whoever might have taken that picture of him and Dick (creepy stalker much? what was the agenda of whoever did this?) and work on arm exercises when he can\u2019t stand to look at the screen anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hunts down the original source- a single reddit account that was created two days after the incident, it has one picture, and it\u2019s been submitted to three subreddits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Jason digs a little more, finds the email address the reddit account was linked to, and jumps from there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The email address was made only an hour before the reddit account- just a random assortment of numbers that are most likely randomly generated. The email\u2019s <em> only </em> been used to open one single reddit account, there's no other attachments to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While that\u2019s running- Jason\u2019s also looking at who could possibly get a camera to take the picture (there\u2019s a lot of photographers in Gotham) and what kind of camera it could be. How far away the photographer had to be to take this particular photo, a diameter of the scene had been taken into account and from there maybe street cameras may have picked something up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Bruce see\u2019s him working on the batcave\u2019s computer he makes a noise in the back of his throat. That\u2019s a noise that makes Jason perk right up, it\u2019s Bruce\u2019s \u2018putting together information\u2019 noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what you got, B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at cameras? A stretch of a connection.\u201d Bruce has a cup of coffee in his hands and dark bags under his eyes. He lays a hand on Jason\u2019s shoulder and squeezes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA stretch, sure, but a connection nonetheless.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can find a way to be discrete about it- the neighbor\u2019s into photography last I remember. He might be able to help you.\u201d Bruce takes another sip of his coffee. He\u2019s got a massive bruise across his ribs and his hip has been sprained.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have <em> neighbors </em> ?\u201d Jason can\u2019t recall ever seeing another house out here. He did Robin shit out in the yard, what if somebody <em> saw </em> him?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce blinks, he removes the coffee from his lips and looked down, a blank look of polite confusion. \u201cOf course we have neighbors? It\u2019s not possible <em> not </em> to have a neighbor in Jersey.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re literally on hundreds of acres? It\u2019s <em> very </em> possible to not have neighbors.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cHave Alfred call the Drakes, ask about the cameras. It\u2019s easier to get an expert's opinion than to learn everything on your own.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks again at the thousands of cameras that could have taken this shot- the millions of possibilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Alfred to make the call.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason sits in the living room, he\u2019s been doing nothing but sitting recently. His broken legs aren\u2019t very conducive to walking all around the place. He can hobble around very lightly, but there\u2019s limits on his mobility that basically means he\u2019s stuck at the manor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least he\u2019s got some cool facial scarring out of it- a busted lip and eyebrow have almost healed into a full blown scab. There\u2019s a rather unfortunate haircut to accommodate the stitches on his head where Joker had cracked it right open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s the day that the neighbor, Drake, is coming over to talk about cameras. Alfred had set up the entire thing yesterday, and the poor butler hadn\u2019t seemed very happy afterwards. He had been polishing the silver in the nice dinning room for hours afterwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now Jason\u2019s curled up with a nice collection of romantic literature, a soothing tea, and a blanket while he waits. His wheelchair sits by the couch, if he wants to bother with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It turns out, having Robin training is actually great in times like these- he can brace up his legs on something that rolls and crawls with his hands. It freaks the absolute hell out of Dick when his brother sees it- but it's faster than getting in and out of a wheelchair every time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The time ticks over to noon- the neighbor should be here in fifteen minutes. Jason can just picture what the guy\u2019s gonna look like. Something from one of Wayne\u2019s Gala\u2019s, or maybe a fat cat that sits so pretty in a political seat? Slick and dark haired with a smarmy smile or an older genuine man who won't give up his money for anything?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason reads two more chapters. Finished two cups of tea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred walks into the room, all perfect posture and raised brow. \u201cYour guest is here to see you, young master.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks up from reading a beautiful piece of gothic prose, already putting on his fake smile for the man who-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a kid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half behind Alfred, a kid who is maybe eight or nine years old. Dark hair and eyes so pale ice blue that any color just blended into the whites. Jesus christ it was like looking at a walking, animated zombie. The kid was pale, shaking slightly, and the only flash of color on his thin self is the fucking <em> blue tie </em> he\u2019s wearing. Grey sweater vest, white collared shirt underneath, black slacks, black shoes, ice cold blue silk tie, and a black backpack with some kind of school logo on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh this is sad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is \u2026 this is sorta pathetic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred bows, the man\u2019s eyebrows are pulled into <em> displeased </em>, and heads out of the room leaving the door open to keep an ear out on the conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick was in New York, getting the degree he was meant to, and Bruce was at work. There\u2019s only three people in this whole wide house, but the neighbor kid\u2019s stiff and still like he\u2019s going to face a gauntlet of attacks from all sides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know all about cameras right?\u201d Jason asks, because honestly this kid needs to unwind just a little bit before Jason\u2019s back starts to hurt from looking at him. \u201cI\u2019m Jason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid nods, once twice three times, so ridged and practiced that Jason is vividly reminded of Bruce. The kid pulls his backpack from behind his little self and just \u2026 hands it over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason doesn\u2019t take it, just looks at the slight shake in the kid\u2019s whole body. He looks like he's expecting to be <em> hit </em> goddamn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The neighbor kid doesn\u2019t know what to do when Jason won\u2019t take the bag, clearly, but he\u2019s also clearly too nervous to do anything more than hold out what Jason assumes is his camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, dude.\u201d Jason asks, blunt as he possibly can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrake, Tim Drake.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the <em> fuck </em> are you this nervous, Tim.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the poor kid breaks down into tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ugly, terrible gasping sobs, the tears are freakishly silent underneath the little intakes of hiccuping breath. The kid\u2019s still holding out his backpack but it\u2019s shaking so bad at this point that Jason has to take it from him. Drake immediately slams his hands onto his eyes to cover up the waterworks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The backpack comes unzipped with Jason throws it down between them, reaching out and putting both his hands on Drake's shoulders to try and calm him down-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pictures spill out of Gotham at night, with the neon signs blurry in the background and <em> shots of Batman and Robin in the fore.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In focus, and in stunning color, pictures from the pre-incident of Jason jumping off buildings and hiding under Bruce\u2019s cape. Pictures of Bruce alone in the Batman cowl, posing dramatically on the gargoyles like he <em> denies </em>that he does. Nightwing, much less pictures of Dick\u2019s blue and black suit and cape from just how rare Nightwing is in Gotham proper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s also pictures of Dick as <em> Robin. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason lets go of Drake, lets the kid step back and curl further into himself, and dives for the photos that spill glossy on the floor between them. Jason can\u2019t go far off the couch but the pictures are just right at the edge of it all. Closeup shots from below, the capes spread out far reaching to catch air from above. Robin, <em> Jason </em>, kicking a mugger in the face with a wide impish grin, followed up by Batman\u2019s brutal crime spree he\u2019s been on recently. There\u2019s backdrop silhouettes and full black and white artful poses of displays of picturesque violence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s hundreds of pictures here, all 8 by 10s. No fingerprints on any of the surfaces, all of them bundled together with loose string in some kind of filing order.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks up from the damning evidence, sharp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake, the neighbor boy, has stopped verbally making noises but still drips tears down his thin cheeks. He stands like he\u2019s on death row, thin shoulders squared as tough as they can be but still shaking with the force to be silent and still.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred races in, as fast as Jason\u2019s ever seen him, and <em> demands </em> to know what\u2019s wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce comes home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The phone call with Alfred has left him ruffled, the butler had called Bruce\u2019s personal line, demanded him to get to the manor <em> now </em> and hung up without another word.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce had been out the door before anybody could even ask him where he was going.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He drove like hell was on his heels, going through downtown traffic at near ninety then once removed from the congestion of other cars Bruce slammed the pedal all the way down. The car wasn\u2019t made to do over one-forty but Bruce was gonna push it till he couldn\u2019t anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door was already opening as Bruce ran up the stairs, Alfred stands as stauch as he ever does but his eyebrow has been pushed to its limit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a child in his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce blinks as he rushes inside, Alfred steps out of the master\u2019s way like a true trained gentleman but Bruce traces the scene in front of him like a trained detective.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason, crawling around half on and half off a longboard, frozen in the doorway of a living room. Jason looks uninjuried- well, no <em> new </em> injuries at least- and Alfred holding onto a toddler with one hand. There\u2019s no disarray in the house, nothing outwardly wrong with the situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s happening?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred shifts a fraction, allowing Bruce to recognize the neighbor boy curled up and red in the face from crying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he okay? Alfred what <em> happened </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk your son, Master Bruce.\u201d Alfred is about as furious as he can possibly look, he\u2019s been mad ever since the phone call last night to the Drake residence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t want to make Alfred <em> more mad </em> so he does as instructed and looks at Jason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason is doing his best to scoot around the polished wood floors with one cast propped onto a skateboard and the other one in a repurposed kidde skate that had been a gag-gift from Dick years and years ago. The kid scrambles back into the living room with his hands, and Bruce has to give Dick some credit about the comparisons between Jason\u2019s preferred movement while injured and the \u2018<em> Ring </em>\u2019 horror movie. Jason lets his torso drop to the ground to throw up his hands, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce throws <em> his </em> hands in a gesture to where Alfred is cradling a crying toddler.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason flips him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce does <em> not </em> flip Jason off in return, because Bruce is both a respected father and twenty eight years old. Bruce <em> does </em> give a very rousing glare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d Jason does a pushup and begins to scramble back into the living room. They\u2019ve had to remove nearly all the rugs in the bottom floor to allow Jason easy access to roll around. \u201cI asked like <em> two </em> questions and the kid broke down!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred follows Jason, crisp steps clicking with the heels, so Bruce does the only reasonable thing and follows both out of the foyer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s pretty fast rolling around at shin height, so when Bruce gets fully into the living room Jason is already handing over a black backpack that Bruce doesn\u2019t recognize.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking inside, all Bruce sees are- \u201cPhotographs?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches inside and pulls out a bundle of about ten or so. There, right on the top, blazed across the night sky of Gotham\u2019s art deco skyline, is Bruce dressed up like a bat and posing dramatically off those gargoyles near fifth ave. Holy shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sits down on the couch, slamming himself down and picking up more of the hidden photographs from the depths of the small black backpack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason claws his way up, onto the couch and then half in Bruce\u2019s lap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you take these?\u201d Bruce asks Drake, looking up finally to the neighbor's kid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a minute, but eventually \u201cY-Yes Mr. Wayne sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake finally looks up from where he\u2019s been tucked away in Alfred\u2019s embrace. The kid is so <em> little, </em> oh my god, all jerky movements and stuttering looks. Alfred does set the boy down, gentle and easy before correcting his jacket from it\u2019s rumpled state. Bruce remember\u2019s Timothy Drake from functions and Gala\u2019s, faintly from his mother and father\u2019s mentions of him and more so from seeing him roam the outer banks of such events like children are meant to. The Drakes have been good people, they donate annually to charities and they normally show up to the christmas ball once a year. Bruce never personally talked to Timothy, but see\u2019s the boy with a camera more often than not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks out of his depth and is haltingly awkward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t blame his son, he feels the same way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d He\u2019s trying to find a way to phrase this delicately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d Timothy asks, small and soft. \u201cThat I took all those pictures of you? I got the call and I gathered them all up- so you could destroy them or wha-whatever. Please just don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That makes Bruce\u2019s blood <em> freeze </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason sums it up like he normally does, by shouting \u201c<em> WHAT!? </em>\u201d into the rafters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you figure out our identities?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After they calm Tim down from thinking he was walking into his <em> own execution </em> at the hands of the Batman and his brood, the kid was relatively fine to speak too. They had to make it very clear that Tim wasn\u2019t going to be hidden away in Arkham or sent to the ends of the world for knowing a secret he shouldn\u2019t. They\u2019re also pretty sure Tim doesn\u2019t believe them when they say he\u2019s okay, he\u2019s fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim bites his lip, Jason wants to hit him to break that habit already, the kid already has a scar there. \u201cIt, I dunno it was easy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason picks up one of the photographs, a picture of Dick as Robin doing a graceful backwards leap off a building with wings spread and Batman behind him with the same, and shows it to Tim. He then points at where Dick is currently sitting, upside down, in sweatpants too big for him eating doritos with one hand and flipping through the collection with the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason makes sure he\u2019s seeing it right- and yeah he is. Dick came by in an absolute rush about twenty minutes ago. Alfred had called him too but it takes time to get from one city to another. Now the oldest brother sits in borrowed-from-their-father sweatpants and an old basketball jersey, nothing at all like the photographs of Robin and Nightwing that dance so gracefully through the air and across buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to explain this one to me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim bits his lip harder, but other than the white spot on a white complexion Tim has no outward sign that he\u2019s uncomfortable. \u201cRichard Grayson is one of the three people in the entire world who can do a quadruple somersault. The other two are in China, I looked them up, they\u2019re professional gymnasts.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t know that, by the looks on his face Bruce didn\u2019t know that either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A beat of silence, Tim looks around but nobody interrupts him so he continues. \u201cRobin did one, one time. I saw it. No cape to help, the mugger had cut something and the cape wasn\u2019t functional anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s ears go ruddy red, just the very tip of the curve of them. <em> The bastard knew </em> , he <em> knew </em> he was talented in a very specific way and proceeded to <em> show off as Robin anyway. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was years ago.\u201d Bruce cuts in. \u201cWe had to redesign the whole hydraulic system because of that incident, you couldn\u2019t have been more than five or six.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I was five.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason catches his brother's eye, Dick\u2019s skin is just a little too dark to blush with a traditional pink but the very tips of his ears turn brilliant scarlet \u201cYou let a <em> five year old </em> catch you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick throws a dorito, \u201cHe\u2019s been trailing you the entire fucking time! <em> No </em> room to talk!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason eats the dorito off the floor. \u201cHe got pictures of <em> you </em> first, you moron.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce makes a gagging sound, \u201cJason we\u2019ve talked about this, please don\u2019t eat food that's touched the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically the first pictures I have of are Batman.\u201d Tim says, underneath it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick throws <em> another </em> dorito. \u201cThen this is all <em> B </em>\u2019s fault.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stretches over to eat that one too. \u201cYou were the one who couldn\u2019t <em> not </em> show off, dickwad!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t eat off the floor!\u201d Bruce physically has to pick Jason up to prevent him from grabbing at the nacho chip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I have something to show off, you <em> brute </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason rips himself out of Bruce\u2019s loose hold to attack his brother. It\u2019s mostly Jason using his core to filing himself as far as he can, but Dick both catches Jason and <em> these fucking hands </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick and Jason proceed to slap the shit out of one another, screaming every insult they knew in every language they could recall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being Batman\u2019s kids, they could recall <em> a lot.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce just sighs, deep from his soul like he does when somebody\u2019s keyed the batmobile. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this, Timothy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid squeeks. \u201cNo worry Mr. Wayne. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you told <em> anybody </em> about this?\u201d Bruce can recall Timothy\u2019s parents bragging that their child had won some basic photography awards in his age demographic, but if Timothy had released any of these photographs before he would have been national news. Hell, he must have released the one single one that was out there now, making headlines and causing the police of Gotham all kinds of grief about \u201callowing\u201d children to patrol their streets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir! No Mr. Wayne I would never.\u201d Tim looks up at Bruce with his pale eyes and pure truth in that way young children generally are. \u201cIt\u2019s not my secret to tell!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason bites his older brother, Dick howls and pinches Jason\u2019s ear, trying to get Jason off his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you told not a single soul, not your friends or parents?\u201d Bruce hates laying into a child but it\u2019s essential that he knows exactly who knows what they shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have friends Mr. Wayne.\u201d Tim says evenly, with a smile. \u201cWhen my parents are home I\u2019m like all children should be, so I haven\u2019t told them either.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t even know how to <em> begin </em>to answer all that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes his teeth out of Dick\u2019s arm to ask- \u201cWhat the <em> fuck </em> does that mean?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick yanks Jason\u2019s ear harder, nearly toppling his younger brother off the couch. \u201cLanguage!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason asks the same question again, this time in Cantonese. Dick smacks him in the stomach for being smart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew you Dickie!\u201d Jason flings his own arm out to smack his brother back. \u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018like all children should be\u2019?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim scoffs, just a blink in his blank facade \u201cSeen and not heard, is how children should be. It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s like a basic saying?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason and Dick look morally offended at this, but at least they\u2019re not attacking one another anymore. Bruce\u2019s face is <em> very </em> blank right now, so blank that it\u2019s horrific. All three crime fighters have nothing to say to that, because none of them have <em> ever </em> been seen but not heard. They\u2019re either loud and proud or not there at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think I bet you\u2019re horrifically offended at young Master Dick and young Master Jason.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred causes nearly all of them to jump, Bruce is the only one not spooked. The butler\u2019s carrying a tray full of chilled water bottles and pretzels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir, not at all.\u201d Tim accepts a water bottle from Alfred when the man puts the tray down. \u201cI look up to them very much sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce watches, in real time, as both of his boys visibly puff up in pride. Of course those two peacocks are responsive to positive words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce makes a note to himself that he\u2019s about to see a lot of this kid in the upcoming days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim excuses himself after a polite and appropriate time of an hour and a half, but Jason pretty much refuses him leaving, asking all kinds of questions about <em> how </em> Tim had kept up with Batman and Robin during their nightly patrols.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Tim explains, the more he talks and the more relaxed he feels the more words come out. He still moves and talks like he figured out how to be human from pictures alone, from one pose to another with little in between. \u201cI figured out your patrol routes and stationed myself at good vantage points to catch good shots. I only move three or four times at night.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which makes <em> Bruce </em> worried that his patrol routes are that easy to follow. If somebody can track his patrol routes that means he can be ambushed which is <em> not </em> what he wants to hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll humans have to have a routine, especially one as meticulous as you, so I figured you have to have some kind of schedule that was both designed to be unpredictable but easy enough for a Robin to follow and remember.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s <em> right </em>. Bruce, on his own, never had a plan or routine because he was mostly reactionary. Something happens and he shows up to deal with the problem. Robin, both Jason and Dick, had to have a specific routes and routines to follow- outside of extenuating circumstances- to both make them vaguely visible to the people of Gotham, have an effective patrol route, and have an easy time remembering what they were meant to be doing and where they were meant to go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which brings around questions from Jason again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick only contributed to a few questions here and there, the questions he did ask however were pointed and thought provoking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim finally goes home after four hours of interrogation- he says he'll just walk back over but Alfred <em> insists </em> on driving the very tired child home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce, Dick, and Jason say goodbye, promising Tim once again that they\u2019re not going to do something drastic because he knows the secret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce, after the door is closed, heads <em> immediately </em> down to the cave. Dick follows right behind, very much ignoring his brother\u2019s demands of help down the slippery uneven staircases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce goes and pulls up every <em> scrap </em> of information available to him about the Drake family-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake Industries, mostly a medical production and supply company with some research on the side, was an active participant in things like Doctors without Borders and research into vaccines for areas in need. It\u2019s a huge company, making millions of dollars a quarter, and the CEO and his wife are constantly on the move trying to help the world be a better, healthier place. They\u2019re not often in the news, only when something truly groundbreaking in their vaccine or cancer research labs occur, but the latest news article on the two heads of the Drake family is that they were last heard of on a small island in French Polynesia trying to help children with cleft palettes born into low income families.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was almost four months ago. There\u2019s been nothing newsworthy since.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason manages against all damn odds to show up halfway through a background check on the Drake's finances, and a check to make sure Tim has no hidden account where he\u2019s been getting strange money transactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you keep getting down here? You literally can\u2019t walk.\u201d Dick demands, looking over Bruce\u2019s shoulder. Dick stands on the right of Bruce, but also is extra enough to balance on the armrest and twist across Bruce\u2019s space to look over Bruce\u2019s left side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Tenacity </em> , Dickie. <em> Tenacity. </em>\u201d Jason\u2019s still in two massive casts, one that goes up all the way to his hip joint, and the other that goes up to right under his knee. He can barely move his pelvis, but his arms still support him fully- since the Joker never bothered to break them. He won\u2019t tell either Dick or Bruce that he\u2019s using the uneven walls and bouldering down without any leg support.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d worry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason asked Alfred to keep a few skateboards around the house to grab and use to roll around on. Alfred had denied him and had purchased two wheelchairs. Jason then asked Dick to do it instead without telling anybody and then <em> Dick </em> was the one who had to suffer the glare of a disapproving Alfred.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick still is mad about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Jason grabs a board, puts it under his hip and long cast, then rolls over to the mainframe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he gets all the way over Jason uses Dick as a climbing wall and hauls himself right into Bruce\u2019s lap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not getting income from anything they have not accounted for on their taxes.\u201d Bruce ignores the child wiggling his way into a comfortable position in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll have to do a more thorough search later, but nothing in the preliminary passes are coming up red.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAny secret accounts under their name?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce loves both of his sons very much, but he does have to push Dick\u2019s head out of the way to reach the screen. \u201cNone besides the usual ones.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason perks up- \u201c<em> Usual </em> ones?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMost people who have more money than they know what to do with have a few offshore accounts.\u201d Dick answers, then makes a face that's a little disgusted with himself for knowing that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir son has an account that\u2019s getting income, but either it\u2019s an allowance or a holding account for when he\u2019s older.'' Bruce does a few more clicks, \u201cI think it\u2019s his allowance, there\u2019s transactions in there for food and for camera equipment, mostly. Some other miscellaneous stuff like computer games and the like.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few more clicks through, a couple of programs running to just make double sure that there\u2019s nothing fishy going on, and Bruce moves on from financials. There\u2019s no mention anywhere in the news about the Drake\u2019s son, but there are mentions of Timothy at charity events and galas once in a blue moon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis parents, are they still out of the country?\u201d Dick asks, his eyes are going over some miscellaneous information thrown onto a smaller screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wiggles forward, grabbing a hold of the mouse. Bruce lets him navigate back to a credit card bill that was of no consequence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He clicks on a line from last night, a bar tab for two.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0In Morocco.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it's a mistake?\u201d Bruce says, mostly to himself, but he\u2019s already seriously doubting that claim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The credit card is in Jannet\u2019s name, and it\u2019s one that gets them airplane miles everytime they buy something. It\u2019s <em> also </em> been used pretty extensively in a slow crawl through Eurasia recently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been no flags of fraud on this account.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck the last time this card had been used in America- in Gotham.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Six months ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve all discovered what I\u2019m mad about.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred\u2019s at the entrance of the cave, he\u2019s got his hands clasped behind his back. Jason peaks over Bruce\u2019s shoulder at the sound, Bruce can\u2019t look behind him due to two wiggling teenagers but Dick makes a full turn. \u201cYou <em> knew </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had strong suspicions ever since I called the residence. It was the housekeeper that answered, she transferred me to-\u201d and here Alfred actually brought up his hands to finger quotes- \u201cquote, \u2018the only one who lived there\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A scoff. \u201cShe was horrid, couldn\u2019t even answer the phone properly.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning Tim wakes up, makes sure that he\u2019s still alive and breathing, and gets out of bed. The housekeeper wasn\u2019t going to be back for another week so he\u2019s got enough time to use his homemade darkroom, go online and check up various leads he\u2019s been looking into, and-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock on the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim huffs, irritated. The stupid camera lense came too early and now he\u2019s gonna have to go and sign and deal with the mail lady that hates him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t bother brushing his hair, it lays flat enough anyway and he\u2019s not meeting the queen, nor does he lace up the shoes he shoves his feet in. The mail lady hates his guts anyway so she\u2019s not gonna bother to even fuckin\u2019 smile for her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The knock comes again, she must be using the big ornate door knockers that Jannet hates people to use because they scuff easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim ambles over from where he was gonna eat his breakfast of cold pizza all the way over to the front door. The mail lady knocks three more times because she\u2019s an impatient asshole who doesn\u2019t think Tim is a valid person to hand packages too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim throws open the massive front door with all the force his little nine year old self can muster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The glare quickly morphs into blank surprise- it\u2019s <em> Jason </em>at the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason, who\u2019s sitting in a wheelchair with Alfred right beside him. \u201cWe\u2019re kidnapping you.\u201d Jason says, very apropos of nothing. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim looks down, he\u2019s wearing a Gotham Knights shirt that\u2019s a decade older than him and twice as big- his father\u2019s, and just boxers. Not even socks. He hasn\u2019t eaten, or brushed his hair, or \u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not ready.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason rolls forward, Tim tries to take a step back to give him room enough to maneuver freely. Jason\u2019s older, he\u2019s a whole lot bigger, and it takes him no effort at all to snag the collar of Tim\u2019s oversized shirt and <em> yank. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t make a noise, but he does lash out at the sudden movement, too taken by surprise to suppress his \u2018fight\u2019 reaction to stressors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s too good to be seriously hit by a reactionary swing though- with the hand not hauling Tim into his grasp Jason smacks away both the punch and the kick. Tim gets put rather haphazardly into Jason\u2019s lap before Jason pops a wheelie and turns on a dime. \u201cAlfred, the car!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re on steps!\u201d Tim tries to wiggle out of the situation he\u2019s found himself in but Jason\u2019s already got a hand on the back of his neck and it\u2019s rock solid. There\u2019s not going to be breaking out of this grip anytime soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred, the poor man, is just walking down as easy as you please while Jason has a wheelie popped and screams \u2018<em> For Valhalla!\u2019 </em> before ramming the stairs at full speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a miracle that they don\u2019t flip or topple, Tim nearly climbs on top of Jasons\u2019 shoulders so as not to overbalance them both. Alfred has the car door open neatly by the time the two boys reach the bottom, Jason uses his superior size and strength to almost physically fully throw Tim into the backseat before he himself grabs the roof with both hands and swings himself in right beside his kidnappie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred closes the door, sharp and crisp. Tim\u2019s not sure how in the world it has come to this, but he\u2019s beginning to think that maybe the vigilantes' of this city really are going to kill him over this whole \u2018knowing the secret\u2019 thing. Jason seems pretty relaxed, but there\u2019s also the fact that he\u2019s been in higher stakes situations than getting rid of a nine year old who\u2019s next check in is in three months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Tim whispers to himself. \u201cI\u2019d be the easiest kid to kill in the whole world.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason \u2026 doesn\u2019t look enthusiastic about that statement, his face is very expressive. So is Dicks, now that Tim thinks about it. Is that a mask thing? Needing to exaggerate facial movements to get the expression across? Maybe Tim just has never seen a person so happy before? Too many variables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drive to the Wayne estate is filled with Jason\u2019s chatter, it\u2019s a whole twenty minutes between houses but it feels like nothing when Jason explains that Bruce and Dick are borth going to be home later in the day but for now they have the <em> entire house </em> all to themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s not sure exactly what's happening here, but he\u2019ll take it. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything very worthwhile today, not until tonight anyway when he was going to take the camera and sit at four prime locations to take some more sneak shots of Batman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he would turn them over to the Waynes, because now the Waynes know that he knows and is taking pictures of them all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh is that weird?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it weird to know I take pictures of you guys when you\u2019re in tights?\u201d Tim asks, because he's not sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred makes noise that sounds like a huff of air, quick and sharp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason, however, looks horrified- \u201c<em> Never </em> call the armour anything close to <em> tights </em> again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick comes home from college pretty often- New York is close to both Bludhaven and Gotham so it's not that far of a drive on a nice day. Dick also really does like to drive around. Yesterday he had cancelled all of his classes for the rest of the week to run to Alfred\u2019s distress call- today he\u2019s going with Bruce to make nice with the reporters and do any kind of damage control he possibly can with the Wayne image.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Either by damaging it and getting the Nightwing and Robin picture out of the media, or by doing some kind of wild charity work with Bruce and kicking gossip off the society rag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s looking to be some kind of public charity work, Bruce\u2019s set something up with his company while Dick hangs around and smiles wide and asks around about the news in Gotham- from both company employees and certain less than wholesome contacts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The streets are saying that Robinis dead, that Joker killed him and now everybody\u2019s paying for it. The rogues can all see the way Batman handles the criminals now, with broken bones and a wicked right hook. The media also can visit the medical ward of Arkham and take a picture of how the Joker hasn\u2019t even woken up yet. Harely Quinn is beside herself, she\u2019s been curled up in her cage in Arkham and hasn\u2019t moved more than to barely eat while she warns everyone else about her mistake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not making good news for Batman- or Gotham in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If people are afraid of Batman then the value of this city goes down, which makes crime rates go up, which makes everything just a little worse to try and make a living in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not always about punching the bad guy and heroically saving the day- it\u2019s mostly boring shit working with computers and knowing how technology interacts with one thing or another and intimidating muggers into dropping little old ladies purses. Almost eighty percent of Batman\u2019s job could be done sitting right here in the cave. The times when Riddler has a dirty bomb about to kill the entire damn state are few and far between- that shit\u2019s expensive on a good day and ludicrous to obtain on a bad one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick and Bruce go home at three o\u2019clock. They chat idly at the Starbucks near the main office as they wait for their coffee before they actually get into the car for the day- it\u2019s nearly forty-five minutes to get home to Wayne Manor and both of them want something to tide them over for the drive. Dick orders something fruity with sprinkles, sparkly and vibrant more so than anything else. Bruce gets something much more sensible and more resembling coffee. Loser.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two of them take only a few requested photos in line, before they head on home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred picks them up, like he normally does, the car this time is a classic thunderbird, the same color blue as Nightwing\u2019s symbol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good day at the office?\u201d Alfred asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI made Powers want to kill me again.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's true, Dick hates the man who rules financials with an iron fist, but Bruce has a special penchant for making Powers furious with seething rage over what amounts to basically nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA true use of that brain of yours, sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce barks a laugh, it\u2019s a sharp single one. \u201cHow\u2019s the house?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is well at the home front, Master Jason invited over a friend today. I made sure the two of them were properly taken care of for the day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Jason do his schoolwork?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I was even done with breakfast, I had told him in no uncertain terms that he was not to invite young Tim over before every bit of homework was done.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick raises an eyebrow, imagining what trouble Jason can get into with somebody smart enough to figure out their secret identities. Dick\u2019s brain supplies the fact that Alfred has to be gone for a <em> minimum </em>of an hour and a half to come and retrieve Bruce and Dick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which means Jason, in all of his mischievous rage, has been left <em> alone </em> with access to the fucking <em> batcave </em> with somebody that\u2019s going to absolutely enable him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh fuck no. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this dangerous?\u201d Tim asks, for probably the fourth time. Jason has ignored him since the first time Tim expressed hesitation on this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason swings around to look Tim in the eye- literally. They\u2019re on the top section of the training area- there\u2019s rows of metal bars off to one side that are wider than normal monkey bars by increments depending on which side one takes. The largest width is four feet of gap- the smallest is two. Jason hangs on the bars right in the middle of the two extremes, dangling nearly sixty feet above the foam fall pit. There\u2019s still netting midway up from when Dick used it last so the fall\u2019s not gonna make him complain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to swing around- a <em> lot </em> easier than walking is right now. Sure it makes the bruises on his ribs ache a bit but where\u2019s the fun in being totally perfectly alright.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s looking a <em> lot </em> more apprehensive about the whole \u2018race you across the foam pit\u2019 thing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a problem when we were on the lower levels.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a problem when we were at <em> the first level </em>. \u201c Tim calls out. \u201cI don\u2019t even think I can reach those bars.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJump.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s face is very impressively blank, it must be a rich person thing to look like you have no emotions behind it all. Jason\u2019s never been able to manage it, Dick\u2019s only good at halfway masking what he\u2019s thinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a stare off between them, Jason\u2019s wiggling his eyebrows hanging off a metal bar with chalk on his hands and a cast on both legs while Tim\u2019s still wearing the big t-shirt he slept in but with his little arms crossed and perfectly poised posture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a few moments of paused silence, pointed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim sighs, looks down at the layered foam underneath them- the netting that\u2019ll catch him if he falls. Jason takes the moment to start gaining momentum, he\u2019s gonna do something dramatic and stupid, but it\u2019ll look cool as hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes a backwards leap, throwing himself in such a way that he twists backwards mid-air and snags the next rung down. Tim jogs backwards one, two steps, then <em> runs </em>forward to take a running leap at the bars.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason makes it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Both of them yell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s fingertips just barely taps the bar, not nearly enough to grab ahold of anything. Jason see\u2019s the leap take a sharp arch and then head <em> straight down </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFall right!\u201d Is the only advice Jason can think of to scream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The aerial net does it\u2019s job, Tim thankful doesn\u2019t tense up or try and flip around, he falls perfectly onto his back with his legs and arms spread full eagle. The net dips, cradling the small body it\u2019s saved, but doesn\u2019t sag like it would for Bruce or Dick- Tim\u2019s a hell of a lot lighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay!?\u201d Jason calls down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gives a shaky thumbs up, still wheezing slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, thank god for that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim begins to move, wiggling along the netting to get back to the ledge. Jason\u2019s hands are beginning to sweat, he\u2019s gotta move or he\u2019ll end up wiggling along the net just like Tim is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s gotta get back to where he started- so he turns around and starts swinging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim makes it to the ledge that the netting is strung to- Jason makes it to the first rung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh he hasn\u2019t thought this through. His legs are broken, how the fuck is he going to get down from the bars?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will it be easier if he goes back two bars and falls into the net too? Nah that\u2019s gotta jarr the bone right? Fuck man Jason\u2019s not a doctor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s right at this moment that a soft \u2018<em> tick </em>\u2019 echoes along the cave walls- somebody\u2019s home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cJASON PETER TODD.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well this is just shaping up to be a great situation all around isn\u2019t it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWHERE ARE YOU.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce climbs up to where they are in the training area with a calculated grace. He snags Jason from where he\u2019s holding onto the bar by his son\u2019s waist and on the way down goes ahead and picks up Tim by the back of his collar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s been trained not to struggle, so he doesn\u2019t, goes limp in his father\u2019s arms and hangs as loose as he possibly can so Bruce has as much mobility granted when holding onto a whole person. Tim, however, had a natural instinct to struggle a bit against the hold, he wiggled and shifted- not trying to break the grip but definitely not making things easier. Bruce makes a note to train that out of hi-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce makes a note not to make notes about training the neighbor kid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s laughing at him, at everyone, leaning against the chair by the computer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred\u2019s upstairs, making dinner, the only one in this household who Bruce still likes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed a hand there, B?\u201d Dick asks, holding his arms out- Bruce passes him wiggly Tim. Dick takes the kid under his armpits and hauls him up. Tim doesn\u2019t make a sound but he does flash out with a sharp little kick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good instincts there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason remains limp, but Bruce can maneuver him with both hands now, flipping his son to his back, right between his shoulder blades. Jason grabs tightly around Bruce\u2019s neck and uses his slightly better leg to brace against Bruce\u2019s ribs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to go upstairs, yell at his stupid son for endagering both himself and somebody elses entire person, and eat dinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark has no real say in this meeting- it\u2019s mostly about the fate of some hero down in Florida who had just freakin snapped and decided to kill their whole rogue gallery. Clark\u2019s already set his vote down- jail time, with a mental assessment beforehand and removal from the justice league.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s not paying attention so hard he\u2019s got his phone out- texting something furiously and scowling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody bothers to tell him to put his phone away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even <em> Clark </em> wouldn\u2019t tell Batman to do something when the man has that look on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash is trying to look on the bright side, so is Wonder Woman. But Martian Manhunter\u2019s also pushing for full removal and jail time. \u201cI looked into their mind.\u201d J\u2019onn is saying, trying to lay it out again for everyone. \u201cIt was not mind control and it was not the work of another. They made a conscious decision to do this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark had seen the footage, from both the rampage and the follow up interview from the league and the police. He might have had a rather black and white outlook on the world but this was something that was rather black and white, wasn\u2019t it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman taps his phone a little harder, his scowl a little deeper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whenever Clark wears gloves he can\u2019t ever get his phone to work right- thank god he doesn\u2019t have static fingerprints or else he\u2019d have to wear the things all the time to keep his secret identity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a weird thing to learn, when he looked into his fake birth certificate when he was seven and compared his fingerprints at the time for his science class. When they didn\u2019t match he did his own testing over the course of a few months and it turns out that the way his skin grew and regenerated it made his fingerprints both unrecognizable as human and not static enough to use as an identifier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s scowl lessens a tad, just a quirk that wouldn\u2019t be recognizable to anybody without Clark\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn, Batman has a good jaw. It\u2019s strong and square with just a little bit of stubble that usually is taken care of with a very in character precision. Batman\u2019s bottom lip is pink, very pink, and a lot thicker than his top one. It\u2019s the only part of Batman\u2019s face Clark has ever seen- the man lines most of the rest of his suit in lead- so it\u2019s probably the most relevant of Clark\u2019s musing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, that and Batman\u2019s wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark thinks way too much about how Batman looks underneath that suit of his. Are the plates covering real muscles that really look like that or is it a stronger kind of padding underneath the trim waist and strong shoulders? Batman has thinner shoulders than any other founding male member, the thinnest waist too, but he beats out everyone else on thighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark thinks it's because Batman uses his legs so much in combat- Clark\u2019s seen Batman choke a man out just using his legs before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Clark had seen that mauver pulled he had almost wanted to say something to Batman about not needing any air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this for two hours now.\u201d Wonder Woman\u2019s voice cuts through the daydreams. Clark pops right back into the conversation, half focused on it this whole time anyway. \u201cWe need to come to a decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark moves his vote- anonymous and through the tablet in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone else does the same, quick as each member wants to weigh their options about the case. Batman was practically done before the voting even started- it took Wonder Woman the longest to think about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The votes go in,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jailtime, removal from the League, mental assessment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Six to One. <br><br>Movement to go forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re done with that decision-\u201d J\u2019onn very pointedly moves his head so he\u2019s clearly looking at Batman. \u201cWhat has kept you so distracted, friend?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman doesn\u2019t even look up. \u201cFlock problems.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can feel his blood freeze. The other members of the League go stock still. Flock problems mean that Robin or Nightwing is having issues and with the recent media <em> frenzy </em>not a soul on the tower doesn\u2019t know that Robin is either dead or halfway to it. Batman has been rather tight lipped about it, he\u2019s taken a while off of League business to deal with his personal family problems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, this is the first meeting Batman had been back to since that horrifying picture had shown up on every single news feed in the country.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone at the table <em> knew </em> Robin, knew him and his smiles and his excitement and his energy when he was at the watchtower with his father. Nightwing was young, but he had <em> made </em> it. Made it to adulthood and out on his own, survived being <em> Robin </em> and made it out into something that could fly on his own. Out of Batman\u2019s wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin, the second one, never did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody here knows if the kid is <em> alive </em>, life support, perfectly fine, dead or anywhere in between.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So now the whole table has gone as still as if Captain Cold froze them all solid. Batman sends another few texts, his phone has one of those crazy privacy screens that mess all kinds of hell with Clarks vision even when he's looking right at them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to bring it up, but everyone also wants to know something, anything, about the <em> flock problem </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark gives people another ten seconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not a soul moves to speak first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fine then, time to put those public speaking classes to good use!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to know, Batman.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Public speaking classes have failed him!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he <em> alive </em> at least?\u201d Clark doesn\u2019t want to beg but he\u2019s willing. \u201cYou have to give us something here, we\u2019re all sitting on eggshells here. Let us know if he\u2019s doing okay if we can visit, if <em> he </em> can visit us. Does he need <em> help </em>? He's a child, Batman-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Batman clicks his phone off, not a sound from either the action or the button press itself. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t realize that he\u2019s only <em> almost </em> fifteen? That I sent a child out into the streets and only by a total and utter miracle of misunderstanding that he came back to us at all? He\u2019s alive, he can\u2019t walk, I was the one who sent <em> my own kid </em> out into this bullshit only to have him cry my name into the communicator and beg me to save him before the Joker ripped it out? Do you not think I <em> understand </em> that my son is only a <em> child </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody dared to <em> breathe </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because what do you say to that?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin is alive, benched, probably for good. Is this enough information for everyone to be <em> happy </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the misunderstanding?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All eyes to Flash. The speedster has both hands on the table, fisted out in front of him with a steady heartbeat and a steady breath. Clark can hear the way Flash's heart always beats solid and heavy, there\u2019s no stuttering interruption in his surprisingly rather slow rhythm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody says a thing, so Flash says again- \u201cWhat was the misunderstanding that saved Robin\u2019s life.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaw tightening, Batman looks away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark watches the way his wings fold a little tighter to his sides, the thumbs against his throat twitching.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf this is a metahuman thing-\u201d Clark tries to say, but Batman throws up a hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone waits, they\u2019re willing to allow Batman time to phrase his words how he wants to be heard, to be understood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a grave misunderstanding of my children\u2019s anatomy- of mine as well.\u201d It\u2019s like pulling teeth, getting information from this man. \u201cJoker was aiming to cause us pain, to kill Robin after days of sustained torture, and he ignored more viable spots to do that in favor of trying to be \u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Unique.\u201d </em>\u00a0Is what Batman settled on. \u201cThe effort on the Joker\u2019s part was extensive, and saved Robin\u2019s life in the end.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark could read between the lines well enough, he wasn\u2019t an investigative reporter for nothing, at any rate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin was <em> grounded </em>, maybe for life at this rate. The picture had shown visible breaks in the wings, but Clark didn\u2019t have enough knowledge about that particular area to have made any real diagnosis- the picture was also dark, with sharp shadows, so it was impossible to make any real physical assessment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Batman I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d Wonder Woman touches a hand to Batman\u2019s, gentle and soft. She\u2019s got a worry line in his brow that only appears when she\u2019s truly upset with something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman stands, with all that coiled control he always does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he walks on his hands, out of the room, nobody bothers to try and stop him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s on his hands, in a handstand, maneuvering the best he can as he barrels after his brat of a housemate.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The manor is vast, but the rules of this game are simple- in the fact that nobody\u2019s allowed to leave the two bottom floors and nobody\u2019s allowed to ask Alfred for help.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick watches as Jason- also in a handstand- turns a sharp left into the formal dining room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dining room is only used for formal occasions of more than twenty people, when the manor has to hire extra staff to help for the night and they bring out the really nice table runners. The room likens itself to those old balls in historical movies, where the dinner scene crests and the music swells with the piano and the two love interests look at each other and swoon. All old warm wood and wall sconces that were once candlelight that matches the chandelier in which Dick has used as a trapeze before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s on the mantle of the fireplace- half climbed up to the very inviting rafters. He\u2019s <em> also </em> been using his arms and hands to move around but he\u2019s been given a huge head start and the ability to hide for his \u2018not a superhero\u2019 advantage. Jason and Dick have to keep moving at all times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick see\u2019s the easier target, and takes a hard turn from tracking down Jason to start climbing the mantle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you lead him to me!?\u201d Tim screams down at them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason falls from his handstand- just for a second to look up at the betrayal he had caused. \u201cThe tortures of the accused did not equal mine; as you are sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse will tear at my bosom, and will not forego their hold!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t quote shit at me! Help me!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason lets out a truly magnificent cackle and leaves poor Tim to his fate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s gonna get his ass later, the fucker, but for now he\u2019s got a sitting duck trying frantically to climb higher up to get to his only chance of escape- the rafters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick reaches Tim before he has any chance, snagging the frantic kid and then climbing down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pouts and complains but holds onto Dick\u2019s back anyway, accepting the loss with grace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Jason didn\u2019t lead you right to me then you\u2019d have never seen me.\u201d Tim sighs as they both shimmer on down to get back on the bare floors again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Dick would never have looked up into the rafters on his own accord- neither him nor Jason go up that high and hide in places that small and dark. \u201cSneaky sneaky.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s now a seeker as well in their game of total manhunt, a glance at the clock says they\u2019ve both got another two minutes to find Jason before the little bastard wins this round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alfred keeps the whiteboard in the off-limits kitchen. He\u2019s the only one to be trusted with the scores and the dry erase maker. Dick has two points- both wins by seeking. Jason has only one point, his also by seeking. Tim, <em> infuriatingly </em>, has three points by hiding alone- the little monster is way better than he should be at hiding in places no human body should be able to fit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick and Jason also aren\u2019t used to all his favorite hiding places yet, but they\u2019re <em> getting there </em>. Tim won the first two games, then the fourth, but hasn\u2019t won since.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick gets to the bottom of the fireplace and sets Tim down. Dick folds into a handstand with a fluid single motion, then takes off in the direction that Jason had left in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was fast, he\u2019s well trained and strong, but Dick\u2019s just a little older, a little better, and most importantly, <em> knew Jason. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the stairs- the little bastard\u2019s been bouncing between the two floors to have the most mobility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d Jason watches Dick race up from the first floor so he bolts up to the second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s faster, has had more experience with handstands, and most importantly has full motor control of all of his appendages. The rules might go against being able to run- but there\u2019s nothing about using your legs to <em> climb </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The staircase is a sharp u-turn style of stair, so Dick\u2019s easily able to hook his foot into the railing on the upper story and haul himself up with an ab curl of the century.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason goes down easy to Dick\u2019s larger weight, cursing the whole time he gets tackled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Jason wheezes from underneath. \u201cI really fucking hate you\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI expected this reception,\u201d said the eldest. \u201cAll men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t quote Frankenstien at me, I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d Jason huffs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick lays there for another few moments yet, he should hit the button on his watch to send an alert beep through the entire manor- letting both Tim and Alfred know the game is over and to reconvene. But it\u2019s comfortable to squish the life out of Jason, letting the brat get his comeuppance for being annoying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wiggles for another few seconds, but eventually he deflates and lets Dick\u2019s heavier weight press him flat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to let me up anytime soon?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if you keep asking.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A sharp wiggle, Jason\u2019s elbowing Dick in the spleen. Dick ignores it, as is his god given right as the older one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only another thirty seconds before they hear the approaching of little hands, and sure enough there\u2019s Tim, on unsteady and shaking hands, wobbling slowly through the hallways. Tim had only learned how to handstand a few days ago- he\u2019s small enough that it\u2019s mostly about balance and not weight so he has no hope of out maneuvering anybody anytime soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, Tim topples over as soon as he spots Dick and Jason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the kid just seems to say \u2018fuck it\u2019 and walk over normally before he sits back down again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I have to crush Jason too?\u201d Tim asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you <em> dare </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t dare, giggling, but he does lie down next to them anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you calling it quits lil buddy?\u201d Dick has to ask, laughing. \u201cTuckered out?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nods, yeah, his arms shake and it\u2019s going to be a few hours before he can do another round of handstand manhunt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They should probably go and get lunch from Alfred, but they\u2019re all too comfortable laying on an old rug on the second floor. Dick moves off of Jason's torso, putting himself between the two younger boys. The sunlight\u2019s warm and feels nice on their skin from where it filters through the stained windows, it's quiet here, away from everything and sequestered in the warmth of Bruce\u2019s home. It's safe here in a way it\u2019s not safe anywhere else in the whole world, a soft space when needed and a place where their edges can be filed into fine points. This place, within the breath of broken families that hover so quiet in the afternoon sunlight, is somehow a place of healing and discovery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A discovery of talents hidden, a healing from hurt not long ago inflicted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A discovery of secrets that should be kept quiet and a healing from bullets in the street.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick sits between two children who need something larger than themselves to follow, something to believe in during terrible times. Jason\u2019s already getting better while Tim is still taking his first steps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing is in New York with his team, trying to peel away the secrets from a tight-lipped group of scientists so they can reverse engineer some kind of bio-bomb that\u2019s going to be deployed in China next week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s in the cave, overlooking coms like he always does nowadays. Alfred\u2019s dusting off the trophy area, polishing the display case that holds the second Scarface.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce Wayne was at a gala tonight, something with crystals and white attire. It\u2019s at the Iceberg Lounge so Jason sits and listens to Brucie talk nonsense to people who make more money than god and run background checks on all the waitstaff and plus ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Iceberg Lounge is the perfect place for this winter wonderland formal, all snowflakes and seals, penguins and christmas trees, crystal chandeliers and wine glasses carved from clear ice in everybody\u2019s hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brucie\u2019s here for business tonight, so it\u2019s a balance between being smart enough to invest in and dumb enough to not pose a single threat. Bruce plays his part well, most people in the world above really do like Wayne Enterprises. Not only are Wayne Enterprises a global powerhouse, pulling in billions a year in pure revenue but the company\u2019s also well known for its glorious charity work and ability to pull nearly anything out of the hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce Wayne is approachable in ways other sponsors aren\u2019t, he\u2019s famous in a very specific way. He tweets out glamorous living shots and party\u2019s that sparkle, he\u2019s shown both doing work in soup kitchens helping the homeless and half naked at strip clubs on the pole and threatening to show more. He\u2019s strangely human, both in real life and in interviews but he\u2019s enough of a figurehead to admire and look to as a celebrity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also unfortunate that when he goes to places like this, surrounded by people who expect certain things from him, he can\u2019t just punch one of Joker\u2019s goons when they emerge from the crowd with a gun pointed to his Temple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce struggles just for show, gasping and throwing his hands up as the party begins to scream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDad!\u201d Jason watches the camera feed from Bruce\u2019s third button and the incredibly nice security cameras that are layered all over the place. \u201cDad, get out of there!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason clicks one of the screens to a news channel- making sure he can get updates from the outside as well, the news is not showing the story yet but it\u2019ll catch up in a few minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t struggle too hard, he doesn\u2019t want to get hit in the head and become disoriented, but he continues to constantly try and break free of the bonds they begin to wrap around his wrists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hits the emergency signal- he\u2019s getting every superhero team\u2019s attention he possibly can on this subject, <em> right the fuck now </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God if he was still able to be Robin this wouldn\u2019t be a problem! This would be perfectly fine and he\u2019d be at that gala busting heads within ten minutes! He\u2019d be <em> at </em> the gala with his father!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He flicks through the camera\u2019s again, trying to find anything or even <em> anybody </em> who could help- Selina Kyle maybe? Except she\u2019s not been invited to this stupid party, everybody\u2019s pretty much sealed in the same room where Bruce Wayne sits hogtied and handcuffed on top of the main table next to a tipped over crystal centerpeice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The League is saying that the emergency call is a low priority, eta nearly two hours, Nightwing hasn\u2019t responded at all but his team is at minimum four hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason <em> hates </em> that he\u2019s essentially desk-ridden, hates with all his heart that he can\u2019t be there to <em> save his fucking dad </em>-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camera\u2019s show the crowd in high definition, the small gathering of the elites all being held hostage by the <em> Joker </em>. The Joker himself is high and mighty, a deranged grin and a suit that\u2019s not only off color for the white out event but also out of season. The poor bastards also got a roaming medical supply after him, with an oxygen cannula and a bag of morphine. The man has crutches even with both his arms broken to the point of unsuitability. Hair wild and half saved off to show vibrant red stitches, the Joker\u2019s holding onto consciousness by pure insanity alone, and Harley Quinn is behind him to help move him around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Joker is demanding that everybody give him the donations for tonight or he starts killing people one by one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with the children!\u201d Joker cackles loud enough to be picked up through Bruce\u2019s earring com, holding the gun to Bruce\u2019s head and musing up Bruce\u2019s finely styled hair. \u201cOne at a time and then work my way through everybody! Poorest first!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s not panicking, he can\u2019t in situations like this, he\u2019s been <em> trained not to </em> in situations like this. He hits the button to activate the coms. \u201cB, respond to your communicator, damn it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s shoulders relax only a fraction of an inch. \u201cI would love to respond to you gentlemen\u2019s request- but sadly my company won\u2019t allow stuff like this!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goons are combing through the crowd, guns raised high and laughing gas contained on their backs, nobody opposes them when they go around searching people for valuables (nobody wears the good jewels to events in Gotham anymore, not unless the event is being held at Wayne Manor).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A goon grabs somebody, wholly picking them up by the neck. \u201cI got a kid to start with, boss!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s somebody that Jason <em> recognizes.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kicking and screaming, putting up a hell of a fight even though he\u2019s about three feet tall, it's <em> Timothy Drake </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank the lucky stars tonight, boss, they\u2019re bringing <em> Tim </em>to you.\u201d Jason snaps through the coms, already trying to come up with some miracle with the new player in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joker laughs, he twists and turns and fails out with his crutch with a mace, Harely catches the off balance man immediately. \u201cBring the kiddo up here! Bring him here!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gets taken to the main table, screaming the whole time. His struggle only seems to amuse the Joker and his gang, while the rest of the captive audience looks on in fear. Tim\u2019s parents- at least the people who he was taken from- are openly crying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gets put right in Bruce\u2019s lap, the goon just <em> tossing </em> the child up there with no care or delicacy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason thinks fast, and comes up with the best plan he\u2019s got.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, right now, get Tim to take your communicator.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Calm down,\u201d Bruce says loud and clearly to the room at large, hiding the message to Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, <em> give Tim your communicator. I have a plan! </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s clearly still wiggling, still too mobile to get any kind of tie on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sighs, the bags under his eyes are real and the exhaustion in his shoulders are heavy. \u201cI can\u2019t put another child in danger.\u201d The voice is barely a whisper, just a hint enough for the microphone to pick up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason can see on the camera\u2019s how Tim twists up to look at Bruce as he speaks- Tim is putting together the situation as fast as it's developing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, <em> trust me </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce closes his eyes, and prays for Jason to pull another miracle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Low again, just enough for\u00a0 a few words to pass between breaths. \u201cTim, do you have pierced ears?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim reacts in a flurry of movement that nobody can predict- not even the Joker Goon that\u2019s reaching to grab Tim\u2019s wrists to tie him up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim rips the single silver stud out of Bruce\u2019s right ear, no time to be careful just pulling straight down, and <em> bolts.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t make a single sound at the tearing the cartilage, the forceful pull doesn\u2019t even yank his head down. Bruce stays a perfect mask over the minimal pain that comes from having torn relatively unfeeling skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>People cry out at the flurry of movement, Tim\u2019s screaming bloody murder and crying out exactly like a kid his age is meant to, he kicks the goon square in the nuts with all the force he can muster and <em> bolts </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t stop running, even through the flash of surprised gunfire that his movement startles out of the goons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He breaks through the open doorway- his own panicked escape leading a good few of the high society making the same break for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>About ten people make it through uninjured, another four make it through taking visible hits on camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still about forty people to worry about- Bruce\u2019s camera feed isn\u2019t going to help much, but Jason still throws it to a screen so he can keep watch over it. The main camera\u2019s he wants to watch are the ones that have Tim on them, flying down the hallway at top speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason clicks on an open continuous line. \u201cTim! Tim, can you hear me?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim screeches to a stop behind a secretary's desk, sliding across the tile as a dozen others file to the elevator area in a mad panic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason watches as Tim grabs ahold of his own ear, dons the blank expression that means he\u2019s not playing a part anymore, and <em> slams </em> the earring through a non-pierced ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim! What the <em> fuck </em>!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have earring holes.\u201d Tim explains, wincing as he begins to poke around the secretary\u2019s desk. He finds a pencil, seemingly what he wanted, and rips off the eraser.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The eraser goes behind the earring as a makeshift backing, Tim\u2019s fingers are tipped with red where Jason can see them on camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Jas-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo real names on coms!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve used mine already!\u201d Tim snaps. \u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin!\u201d Jason\u2019s mind is working overtime. \u201cCall me Robin-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what the hell am I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s eyes catch Joker looking at the skylights of the Iceberg Lounge, twitchy and constantly scanning for the <em> real </em>ruler of Gotham-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call you <em> Placeholder </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce makes a note that he really should be wearing two earrings to formal events, two nice simple silver studs that both work as communicators. He\u2019s old enough now, probably, that it won\u2019t be seen as an \u2018act of stepping out\u2019 or whatever the newspapers had called his original earring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody\u2019s noticed the fact that his ear\u2019s bleeding, it\u2019s a rather small injury in the grand scheme of things right now. Harley gunned down the man who allowed Tim to escape, then shot the two guarding the door in the kneecaps for good measure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joker\u2019s furious that he has to rely on somebody else to be his movement, he\u2019ll never be able to pick his arms above waist high ever again, but at the same time he seems to be delighted that his heist is going so well even in his compromised state. Joker <em> does </em> keep looking to the sky, through the massive windows with what might be a hint of fear hidden in those empty depths of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking for Batman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce himself is relatively uninjuried, everyone else is relatively bored. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve never been held hostage at one of these things before. There\u2019s a betting pool if you know where to look for it about what high named celebrity is going to get kidnapped next-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick won a whole lot of money tonight, because he <em> always </em> bets that Bruce Wayne is going to get kidnapped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Bruce\u2019s own odds of being kidnapped are spectacularly low, actually, he\u2019s one of the least likely in all of america for how butt-numbingly famous he is.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The donations can\u2019t even be hand collected in an event like this- it\u2019s all mostly through digital donations nowadays and tracked through a projector screen showing the numbers up on the ice at all times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harley <em> screams </em>, high pitched and full of terror.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce mentally checks if he has the holster on his thigh which holds all the up to date personal antidotes on both Scarecrow\u2019s fear toxin and Ivy\u2019s lust dust. There\u2019s also some minorly out of date antidote for Joker gas, but there\u2019s a super good reason that he hasn\u2019t created the newest version of that and it\u2019s not procrastination no matter what Dick accuses him of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s because the Joker gas is hard to synthesize, that\u2019s all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All vials are there, but there\u2019s no undercut of earthen moss smell that curls around with fear toxin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It also helps that Bruce <em> knows </em> that Crane is definitely in Arkham and doing very well with their new bingo nights program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So why does Harley Quinn point a finger to the sky and cry out:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Its a fuckin\u2019 ghost! </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone looks up, thinking that this is just another part of the game. They\u2019ve all got a part to play here and if that part is serving an audience to theatrical megalomaniacs then they\u2019re going to be the best damn audience ever-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce nearly dies on the spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That can\u2019t be Jason, up there standing in the skylight back lit by the not-quite full moon. It can\u2019t be Jason, small and fragile and <em> clearly </em> not a full adult yet, the Gotham fog and dramatic distance make it hard to pick up details beyond the gasping, drifting, <em> ghost </em> of translucent tattered wings that spread around the dark outline. It can\u2019t be Jason, arms spread and dripping with dark liquid, blurry face covered in red when the lights from below light up the figure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be Jason, because that figure is standing on it\u2019s own two unbroken legs, thinner than Jason\u2019s broad shoulders and shorter by a good amount of inches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s mind gets over its vivid hallucinations of a ghost of his very much alive son, and puts it\u2019s massive brainpower to work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s up there, with Jason in his ear, and they\u2019re-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well frankly they\u2019re scaring the <em> shit </em>out of all the hired goons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everybody\u2019s seen the picture that Tim put out on the internet, with the bloody and limp body wrapped up in a brother's wing, they hear no scrap of information from any news site about Robin reappearing on the streets. Everyone\u2019s thought Robin has been <em> dead </em> this whole time, Bruce, Batman, had <em> let </em> them think Robin was dead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now there\u2019s a ghost above them all, small and fragile with wings made of gossamer shimmering fog.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I KILLED YOU! </em> \u201d The Joker screams up at the figure of a myth. \u201c <em> I BROKE YOUR WINGS! I WON!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harley\u2019s throwing the gun, screaming down at and with the rest of the grounded earth, \u201cI\u2019m <em> done </em> Mista J! I\u2019m fucking done! I saw that kid die once. I am <em> not </em> here to watch it again! This isn\u2019t <em> funny </em>anymore!\u201d She moves away from Joker, from the man she was supporting, towards the high table where Bruce is tied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goon\u2019s are high tailing it out of here, they\u2019re throwing in the proverbial towel, literal gun. The army of clowns has turned into a graveyard shift of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I KILLED YOU! </em>\u201d Joker\u2019s screams are dangerously maddening, even as he tips over and into his own insanity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is close enough to hear Harely say to herself, in almost a normal voice, \u201cMaybe this was never <em> funny </em>at all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hands on the ties, Bruce\u2019s eyes jerk from where Robin stands above them to right in front of him. Harely\u2019s got a knife in her prefered red and black, sharp and open right next to delicate unprotected arteries, Bruce panics for less than a second, already moving in an instinctive headbutt, but Harely\u2019s knife slices through the rough hewn ropes, not skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is free, nearly all the rest of the guests are fleeing, and Harely\u2019s got a glint in her eyes that means something terrible is going to happen soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce isn\u2019t going to be around to bear witness to it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d He tells her, already up and moving, already planning on how to get up to Robin as fast as humanly possible to grab him away from what\u2019s already in motion in the criminal underbelly of this city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harley doesn\u2019t acknowledge, she\u2019s already turning on her heel and <em> bolting </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wing\u2019s are made out of two curtains and what remains of a decorative centerpiece, held together with shining silver duct tape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s got a response from Nightwing, the guy\u2019s offworld and he\u2019s sort of <em> freaking out </em> about the situation. Jason sends an update the best he can and hopes that Nightwing doesn\u2019t have too many heart attacks between now and when he gets back. Jason\u2019s also already retracted League assistance- Batman is on his way up the stairwell right now, tearing through the floorplan like a madman with no regards to how many cameras there are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s just going to gloat to himself for a bit, halfway through the Iceberg Lounge\u2019s remote systems to delete some key footage of tonight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joker\u2019s writhing on the floor, Jason think\u2019s the man\u2019s pissed himself. There\u2019s only three goons left but most of the Gotham Elite have already either escaped or used their purses as weapons and beat down the unskilled thugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The people of Gotham have quickly learned that the Bat can\u2019t be everywhere, so the amount of people who know how to throw a punch or two in this city is astronomically high. There\u2019s nightly defense classes and the rate of people who are taking some kind of martial arts is through the roof. It\u2019s not strange at all that both of Bruce Wayne\u2019s children are occasionally seen at the GCPD taking courses with Barbra Gordon and her father.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing too, or else Bruce would have had to do a little more work to get those people to real safety down there instead of just bolting off into the night in <em> full display </em> of the cameras.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce bursts onto the roof, Jason watches through the camera that still is totally active in Bruce\u2019s button on his jacket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stands as tall as he can on an old box, the hastily put together ensemble includes a scrap of fabric across his eyes- a remnant of the torn tuxedo jacket that\u2019s been hacked at with a pocketknife. The whole \u2018Robin\u2019 costume has Tim\u2019s pants cut into four strips and used as the faux cape tied with a knot at the collar. A destroyed table centerpiece had been duct taped together and-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you wearing curtains?\u201d Bruce asks, he\u2019s already taking off his own tuxedo jacket. It\u2019s cold outside, too cold for this nonsense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tim and Jason say together, though Bruce can\u2019t hear Jason at all right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre- what are you using for blood?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason rolls his eyes, this is getting ridiculous; \u201cPlaceholder, take me out and give me back to B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim does, gets a bitten off-fingernail behind the stud and rips it out of his own ear with no thought or care. The bloody cartilage begins to bleed again, an open hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A second or two, B\u2019s voice filters through the coms. \u201cRobin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere I am, get everybody home as fast as possible. Report back.\u201d Jason clicks through another few security cameras to delete the footage of a small kid ducking into a janitor's closet with a verifiable mountain of craft supplies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFull report.\u201d Oh that\u2019s the Batman voice, all deep and growly. \u201cRight now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Bruce cam goes all funny, the fabric must be folded in on itself, but through the Iceberg Lounge itself Jason\u2019s already taking screenshots of Bruce holding up a bundle of his own jacket. This is blackmai- <em> payback </em> for all the times Tim took all those embarrassing pictures of Jason and Bruce.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were indisposed, because you don\u2019t want the world to know you\u2019re a badass for some reason, so my plan was basically \u2018make Joker piss himself\u2019 and cause enough of a distraction for the party to fall apart.\u201d Jason rambles out the report like he\u2019s been trained to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlaceholder has a pocketknife and the ability to take instructions really, <em> really </em> well, so we improvised! The stuff we stole from the party and the blood is fake, it\u2019s some kind of red sauce from the kitchen. I promise B, I was the eyes in the sky for the whole thing and made <em> sure </em> that nobody got close to any thugs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m headed to the cave.\u201d Batman\u2019s taken over the situation now, it\u2019s all in the growl of the voice and the posture that Jason can see through the security feeds. \u201cGet it ready for us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody\u2019s hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Robin. </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason rolls his eyes, and starts to turn on some protocols to allow quick access into the cave. \u201cAgent A\u2019s heard everything, he\u2019s headed towards the door.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s getting his face washed off by Alfred, sitting on a table in med-bay with his legs swinging and munching on some kind of sandwich. His parent\u2019s are already on a plane, they had called Tim once to make sure he wasn\u2019t dead and to tell him to look over the house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason is getting his ass fucking chewed out by a furious father, asking what the <em> hell </em> is wrong with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is very much not fair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s also trying to be there, but his connection is shaky at best and downright not connected at all at worst. He\u2019s somewhere with his team in <em> space </em>with that whole bio-bomb mission with Starfire and China but the connection is somewhere along the lines of \u2018potato-vision\u2019 or maybe \u2018filmed with a toaster\u2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, Nightwing\u2019s trying his best to be in the conversation but not only is it delayed by about fifteen minutes and it only catches every eighth word or so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Robin </em> is being asked if he still has a brian in his head, real time no delay and with every word crystal clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt saved your ass didn\u2019t it?\u201d Jason throws back at his father, all wicked quick and angry. \u201cWhy are you so mad if everyone\u2019s okay and the Joker\u2019s back in prison!?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re still <em> hurt </em> !\u201d Bruce is never loud, he never screams, but he does say things with such <em> force </em> to them, it makes something deep in Jason react viciously to it, like he's back in that rotting apartment years and years ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaon\u2019s blood goes cold, freezing him in place, wide eyes and a quick heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason gets wrapped up in strong arms, soft and gentle, a hand through his hair and an arm supporting him no matter what. Jason\u2019s panic, his worry, his desperation to protect, gets melted in a warm embrace and soft words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bruce tells him, spoken into his ruffled hair. \u201cI\u2019m so <em> sorry </em>Jason.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wraps his arms around Batman\u2019s neck, Batman will never hurt him, Batman saves the day, beats the bad guys- even this kind of bad guy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick rubs the back of his younger brother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s face is red, blotchy, ugly and wet. Dick knows this feeling, this horrendous feeling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m being <em> replaced </em>.\u201d Jason rubs his face in Dick\u2019s side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d Dick whispers, bringing Jason further into his lap. \u201cI wasn\u2019t, and neither are you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both at Dick\u2019as apartment in Bludhaven, all greys and blues and blacks in a way the manor was all reds and yellows and browns. Dick\u2019s got a pretty nice penthouse here, spacious windows that look over the city- a view all the way to New York, Dick always likes to joke. There\u2019s things here built for comfort, not for show or display like the manor always is. It\u2019s all expensive and modern, sure, styled with the help of some of the world's best interior decorators, but there\u2019s personal touches that dip in and out because there\u2019s nobody to <em> impress </em> here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick just brings over friends, his family, coworkers sometimes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no great big impressive parties here, this is secret, just for him and who he invites, and now it\u2019s a sacunatry away from what the Manor represents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason came in with an override code for Nightwing\u2019s own personal cave, driving one of Bruce\u2019s nice cars and speeding like he would when being Robin-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce had sat Jason down and explained, in excruciating, saddening detail, that Robin and Batman were <em> myths </em>, perpetrated by the talk of the criminal underbelly. That the reason why the rouges hadn\u2019t gone on terrible crime sprees was that they\u2019re funneling all that destructive creativity into trying to take down the myth that was Batman, the cape and cowl, not the man behind it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not a <em> man </em> behind a mask, it\u2019s just a mask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce Wayne would never be Batman, no matter how much Batman is Bruce Wayne. Batman will <em> always </em> be Batman, a shape in the darkness that swoops in to reclaim the day for the light. A symbol in the sky that everyone can blame, that everyone can look up too. Batman is nothing but an ideal, just like Superman\u2019s always going to be perfectly unobtainable, not that fallible man that the whole family has seen underneath the cape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A cape was a cape, a mask was a mask, an ideal an ideal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no \u2026 <em> person </em> underneath it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s just another myth, another ghost, another voice in the screaming nothingness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin was dead, a cape laid to rest, a person that was taken by the myth that the city whispered to one another. Nobody expected Robin to come back, to grow older, to be anything but light behind the dark bat in the symbol. Robin could be buried and no more kids needed to be hurt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until Joker was taken, screaming, back to Arkham, raving about broken birds rising from the grave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t <em> understand </em>, didn\u2019t want to maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick holds his little brother, murmurs low soft words into dark red hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to let go of the power that Robin holds. It\u2019s hard to willingly give the cape from one hand to another,\u00a0 it's even worse to have that cape taken without permission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s going to be expected out there now, going to be looked for and counted on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin needs to show their feathers to the streets of Gotham, a colorful angel that flies over the city skyscrapers telling the people that there\u2019s <em> hope </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin is magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Too bad that Jason\u2019s just got his magic wand taken away from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim didn\u2019t want to take it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t want to give it up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the Riddler demands Robin to show up to the games now, Ivy takes her lust dust out of the equation when a child is on scene, Penguin brings extra guards, expecting two people. Joker\u2019s going crazy, er, crazier trying to find out how Robin came back from the dead, Two-Face makes two person traps in anticipation of a coin flip-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick can\u2019t be here all the time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s not Bruce Wayne\u2019s kid, but he might as well be for the amount of time he\u2019s here now. Jason\u2019s healing at a rate that\u2019s stubbornly human, which is annoying, but even then he\u2019s the one who\u2019s overlooking Tim\u2019s training. Dick\u2019s in college, he\u2019s trying his best to be everywhere at once, but he does want a degree in criminology and he\u2019s not sacrificing grades to his night work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin makes appearances only sparingly, careful not to be in the line of fire without completing the training that lays before him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s on coms every night, he\u2019s looking to graduate highschool early and get into law maybe, maybe an english degree? He does love looking through books, thumbing the pages and thinking about the love that goes into each word chosen with such specific purpose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin gets trained with Jason\u2019s old wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nearly cries when they get put on his back, secured tight against narrow shoulders. He apologizes to Jason, apologizes for this whole situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no forgiveness here, not yet, there\u2019s just teaching, one Robin to another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s six months before Robin really does fly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heat of summer, with wing\u2019s so thin that they\u2019re mostly see-through underneath the spotlights and neon of the city\u2019s night lights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not as long as Jason\u2019s preferred style of pure intimidation, but nothing like Nightwing\u2019s short maneuverable ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick isn\u2019t a powerhouse, he\u2019s quick and light and built for twists and turns, he doesn\u2019t get hit because he\u2019s already ducked out of the way. Dick\u2019s main style of fighting is getting in, attacking twice, and getting back out before the opponent can retaliate. Strong, sure, but he\u2019s never going to drop people with one hit, Dick\u2019s made for movement, twists and turns and sharp angles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason is growing to be a brick shithouse, in opposition to his older brother. His frame has a whole lot of power behind it, he strances up and only has to hit people one time for them to get the memo. He\u2019s got strength in spades, easily packing on muscle and keeping it there. His time without use of his legs has built up his shoulders to something nearly as intimidating as Batman himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim, it\u2019s quickly discovered, is good at <em> enduring speed.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s fighting style lends itself to multiple breaks, Jason\u2019s all power all up front, Bruce\u2019s is technical without a single breath wasted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim never fucking stops <em> moveing. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s able to stand now, his cast got taken off month five into his recovery, but the physical therapy to get all the strength and coordination back is going to take time still.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But now that he can walk around, he can <em> train </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their fighting styles have been shaped by who\u2019s taught them, the people they battle, and the wings that they wear. Twirling, Dick uses his wings like they\u2019re a part of him for real. All whipped out feathers and hard metal rods that send shocks of electricity through anybody that they touch. Jason gets caught in the neck by Dick\u2019s dulled down blunt force primaries more than once, the air getting cut off from his windpipe with a gasp and he has to sit down for several minutes before he can get back up again. Jason is much more of a fan of using his reach to his advantage, the blockier heavier hitting fiberglass bones, the allua feathers, hitting Dick back hard as he can in the stomach and knees.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s got the shortest reach, but he\u2019s decided he\u2019s going to be a menace with <em> all of the weapons </em> hidden in his feathers. The kid goes down, and then Dick gets hit in the face with a collapsible metal bo staff. Jason dodges one swipe of a wing just to have Tim follow it up with a batarang that he threw behind his feathers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce fights like a monster, all movements with no waste and the power of a nuclear bomb behind heach strike, he\u2019s got the most mobility in his cape as well- Bruce doesn\u2019t like calling them wings- so he uses them with a <em> force </em> that\u2019s like a natural disaster. Each of the claw tips are heavy titanium, sharp, Bruce has trained himself to catch any spare bit of clothing and <em> pull </em> his victim to him- or tear a hole into their sides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tries out fighting with Bruce\u2019s setup, the flexible membrane without the feathers. He\u2019s thinking about his future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s already sketching up something new, some<em> body </em> new. Alfred\u2019s helping him. His time at the computer has unearthed a whole bunch of interesting street level crime that somebody like <em> Batman </em>could never deal with, underneath Nightwing\u2019s watchful eye. It\u2019s all street level, all simple exchanges that spiral out of control in ways that affect the big boys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Tim gets trained by his two previous incarnations, and Jason regains enough strength to get ready to put something in action that Bruce won\u2019t like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s spending his Friday nights like he always imagined he would spend them in the wild and crazy big city when growing up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in space, holding up a part of the watchtower as a man in a bat costume that\u2019s worth more than Clark\u2019s life sits and does repairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s leaning into Clark\u2019s thigh for support, a plasma torch resealing torn metal that got roughed up in a scuffle of an invading alien force.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, okay <em> invading alien force </em> was a bold kind of headline for what had actually happened, in that seven rouge space pirates had thought earth was easy picking for ruling and tried to break into and take over the watchtower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the monthly founders meeting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Diana had punched the biggest one hard into a console, scratching a huge gouge into the floor and shredding the underside, the aliens have been gathered up and taken by GL to the lanterns for trial while the rest of the founders are cleaning up and getting ready to go home for the weekend. Flash was great at buffing out scratches and general cleaning, but for all he\u2019s a hell of a lot faster than Clark the man\u2019s not nearly as strong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So now Superman\u2019s basically lifting up the sofa as the wife vacuums underneath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, okay, maybe not that simple-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop shifting around.\u201d Batman\u2019s voice comes from where he\u2019s pressed against the hard line of Clark\u2019s thigh, \u201cI\u2019m nearly done.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark doesn\u2019t know how any of this has happened? Genuinely he was doing so well today, he kept his mind occupied with thoughts of Louis lately, not his teammate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knew Louis, he knew her well as Clark and a coworker and a friend. He had been hanging out with her for years and they laughed together over dinner more than once. THey had friends in common and they were getting closer over the years they had been sharing the same space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can fit the amount of information he had on Batman on <em> one hand </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the man had the jawline of a god and a heart of gold. The way the man moved was something to behold for mere mortals and Batman\u2019s <em> mind </em> was astonishingly intelligent. God the man was all vicious muscle and wicked grace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can feel the steady, slow heartbeat of the man against his leg, and it\u2019s driving him sort of crazy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound of the plasma torch cuts off, and Batman moves from underneath the console with silent shuffles, tapping Clark\u2019s knee with a soft touch. \u201cI\u2019m getting out from under you now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laughter, from Flash. \u201cWow, Bats, is that how you talk to all of us or is Supes over here special?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman started to ease the console back down, making sure to do it as gently as possible as to not scuff up and dent the floor of the space station. They didn\u2019t need any weak spots up here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous, Flash?\u201d Superman calls back. \u201cThat I\u2019m B\u2019s favorite?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s already going to the controls on the console and making sure that the teleporter still works right. He\u2019s not answering the game around him, he never does get roped into banter like this unless he has a devastating line to drop on everybody.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Bats makes it a <em> secret </em> that he likes you the most.\u201d Flash says, walking on over at almost a normal pace. \u201cYou and Diana. Meanwhile Hal and I are scraping by on the fact we were here first to have any authority here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not true at all.\u201d Superman knows how versalite both Flash and GL are at this, they\u2019re not heros to underestimate. \u201cBoth of you are excellent team members who have a right to be at the head table.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash throws up both hands. \u201cNot as <em> excellent </em> as two gods and an angel, I\u2019m okay with being just a little fish in a big pond Supes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman shifts, the man\u2019s always sort of uncomfortable when people mention stuff like that around him. Clark decided a long time ago to help break those kinds of rumors- \u201cNot a god, Flash. You wouldn\u2019t call Shayera or Carter angels, don\u2019t call B one either.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash, clearly realizing his misstep here, winces. \u201cYikes, yeah, sorry. That- It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem man.\u201d Superman allows Flash to flash one more sorry expression before bolting off to go clean more disrupted parts of the tower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman relaxes a bit when Flash goes, his shoulders tick downwards just a little bit and his stance eases. Superman has seen the footage, Batman is most at ease with him and Diana, nobody else has seen the man without the intention to pounce.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t call you that if you were more of a man to them.\u201d Superman says he has also thought about this. \u201cA man with a name that\u2019s not Bats or Spooky or B.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> No </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I figured.\u201d Clark doesn\u2019t lean into the console, because he\u2019s not going to press a damn button before the all clear rings out. \u201cIt\u2019s to protect your boys isn\u2019t it? If we know <em> you </em> we know <em> them </em>, and that\u2019s a hell of a lot more dangerous isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fingers still on the holographic display still, just for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re smarter than anybody gives you credit for.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s used to that though, used to people underestimating his intelligence in favor of seeing his strength.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you all my identity for a various list of reasons, one of the top ones being my children.\u201d Batman\u2019s hands trail gently through the blue light of the hologram, moving information around but not editing it. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you because underneath all this I\u2019m not who you think I am. I\u2019m nowhere close.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a good man.\u201d Clark is quick to say, \u201cA good man no matter what.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman snorts what could be a laugh, but it\u2019s not quite right. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly as good of a man as you seem to think.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark takes a chance, just for a second. He grabs the wandering hand on the hologram, presses through the light display at just above what a human could move at naturally and links their fingers together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s gauntlet is warm leather, the pads of strong armor across the back of his finger and palm are hard underneath Clark\u2019s fingertips, the soft flexible material is gentle and soothing on Clark\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman doesn\u2019t pull away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t trick me, B.\u201d Clark says, trying not to scare away the ever flighty Bat. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in action, I know exactly what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for nothing in return. There\u2019s a reason why we all defer to your judgement when everything\u2019s on the line, there\u2019s nobody else I\u2019d rather follow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman doesn\u2019t sigh like anybody else Clark has ever seen, he simply <em> sags </em> for a moment, a war within himself between two sides. Faster than most people could fathom, Batman makes a decision. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly got a way with words, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s grip gets tight, locked and dangerous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alarm bells go off in the back of Clark\u2019s mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Batman\u2019s low rumbling register, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so good at your day job.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark goes stock still, his heart ticks up and his mind <em> screams </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman <em> knows </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman\u2019s identity isn\u2019t a known one, everybody in the League has had the option to keep their identity a secret, only files accessible after death have instruction on what to do with the body and even then Clark had made sure to put no identifying information on that- he was to be taken to his fortress in the arctic and from their his ship\u2019s AI and robots would know what to do with him. There\u2019s more secrets than truth in the lounge of this place, with most people preferring code names to actual ones. Superman wore no mask, but his face was nothing but another one in the crowd of thousands, there was nothing remarkable about him without the cape, there was nothing of any interest in his life, nothing but the side along reporter to Louis Lane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s emotions flash through him, surprised, awe, questioning, and <em> anger </em>. Betrayal, because Clark had never attempted to go through Batman\u2019s own life, respected the man enough not to look around at meta\u2019s with his particular disposition. Clark hadn\u2019t ruffled through the secrets of his teammates like-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s figured it out but has kept it to himself until he needed it, there\u2019s nothing that man does without thinking through it all first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark squints. \u201cAre you trying to get me mad at you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s three steps away within a half second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark blinks, his hand is still held up halfway through the holographic display. Batman <em> was </em> trying to incite an emotion, that\u2019s easy enough to figure out, it\u2019s easier enough to figure out that the emotion Batman was trying to rile up in Clark was <em> anger </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But why? Why would- \u201cYou wanted me to leave here with a certain opinion of you.\u201d Clark realizes. \u201c<em> Why </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lips pressed together, hard, hard enough to throw a scar on the left side up in a contracting purple color. \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark steps forward, following the path that Batman traces backwards- \u201cWhy would you want me to think any less of you?\u201d Superman is baffled, out of sorts, he doesn\u2019t <em> understand </em>. \u201cBats, B, help me understand.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s wings <em> flare </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark steps back now, to catch the whole sight in front of him, the sight he barely gets to see outside of missions or interrogations, the sight he wants to see a hell of a lot more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wide, imposing, nearly touching the glass on either side of the observation deck. The bones underneath the membrane show stark and obvious, delicate in a way that undermines Batman\u2019s strength. The way that they\u2019re built into, around, the suit\u2019s gorgeous, everything\u2019s been thought of and tailored to fit the exact curve of Batman\u2019s body. There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s been forgotten, been left to chance, been hidden away. The flare of the wings cover the sunlight behind them, allowing Clark to nearly see <em> through </em> the thin skin that allows flight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s beautiful, like this. His body is normally so hidden under his wings, his posture and expressions covered up by wings so tightly wound. Superman thanks Rao he doesn\u2019t need to breathe, because the air in his lungs escapes at the sight of this meta.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark <em> wants </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s lips pressed together even more, he folds himself back up within seconds of the flare, wrapped tightly up to his chin. He\u2019s curled in a way that\u2019s protected, that\u2019s hiding something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you fall for a lie, <em> Kent </em> .\u201d Batman says low and dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s the same exact reason why you don\u2019t simply let the reporter sleep with you, it would be <em> deceitful </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you <em> mean </em> ?\u201d Clark has to ask, has to <em> know </em>. Batman\u2019s always been a bit of a bastard about everything, but-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman strides forward, past where Superman stands still flustered and trying to catch his breath. He taps out a command on the teleporting console, and disappears in a jarring distortion of light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark sits with Louis in her home, late at night on a Tuesday with a gallon of icecream between them both and\u00a0 a sappy rom com on the TV. <em> Clark </em> is with Louis, not Superman, it\u2019s not a Superman kind of night, it\u2019s a cry in the bathroom while slamming down vodka at an alarming rate and trying not to drown in a bathbomb kind of night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rom-com is some kind of superhero spoof, it\u2019s hopelessly romantic, full of kisses and deep confessions and the ability for everybody to <em> talk </em> about their damn feelings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou musta been real hung up on this dude.\u201d Louis says around a mouthful of mint chocolate chip. \u201cTo be this broken up about it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em> confused </em>.\u201d Clark tells her, his own spoon twirling around, a baton leading armies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a whole lot of <em> confusion </em> to feel over a friend from the internet.\u201d Louis takes her spoon out of her mouth and passes the ice cream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking the ice cream Clark digs his spoon in, \u201cI don\u2019t get why he won\u2019t let me be real friends with him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The apartment is cozy, nice and warm, with too many blankets and too many throw pillows. It\u2019s all in blues and creams and whites, all personal photos up on the wall and plates that don\u2019t match. It\u2019s a real homey place, Clark, Louis, and Jimmy have all broken down on this couch before, over various things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell maybe he\u2019s a huge catfish and is scared that you won\u2019t like his real face?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I make it clearer that I don\u2019t care who he turns out to be?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis snatches the icecream back with her spoon, spearing it and dragging it close. \u201cWell, you say that he\u2019s uncomfortable about certain topics, maybe he\u2019s lying about things in that vein, so avoid those-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be <em> lying </em> about what he\u2019s uncomfortable about.\u201d Clark hasn\u2019t made any mentions about <em> who </em> he was talking about, so he can\u2019t just casually let Louis know that Batman was uncomfortable with any mentions of his very real wings. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good guess that it's more like- It\u2019s more like a person with acne uncomfortable with mentions of how it looks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis internet friend has admitted that he has acne but still won\u2019t meet with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s \u2026 <em> sorta </em> met with me?\u201d Clark has to figure out a better cover story for the Justice League. \u201cWe have dungeons and dragons sessions together.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis laughs, like she always does when D&amp;D comes up, but she always sobers up and gives pretty good advice. \u201cSmallville, are you in love with <em> him </em> or this dude's <em> character? </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Love? </em> \u201d Clark chokes on his bite of ice cream. \u201cYou think I\u2019m asking after <em> love </em> advice?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis nods, bobbing her head and tucking the blanket a little tighter to her chin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLouis, I\u2019m not gay-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever said <em> that </em> exactly-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with him!\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy have we had, like, <em> seven </em> sleepovers about your love life drama about this then?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were talking about our intrapersonal relationships!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis laughs even harder than she does about the dungeons and dragons thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Jason\u2019s going to try and be a crime lord.\u201d Tim says over a quick meal in the batcave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick has just taken a bite from the ham and cheese BLT sandwich which had been lovingly crafted by their quai-grandfather. Tim had timed this on <em> purpose </em>, the little shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t take a bite of his own sandwich, he\u2019s got a limited amount of time before he gets talked over, \u201cI think he\u2019s taking over the gang\u2019s in Crime Alley to instill his own rules onto them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick swallows, the sandwich really was just a mid-patrol pick up, to bring them back to the cave and relook over the entirety of Gotham for a quick forty-five minutes before potentially heading back out, depending on the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to explain that a little better, PH.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim winces a little bit at the nickname, but Jason\u2019s been calling him <em> \u2018placeholder\u2019 </em>since day one and it\u2019s a hard thing to shake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen him talking on the phone with people that I\u2019ve backhacked to trace to Crime Alley, and we\u2019ve heard rumors of that new player in the game.\u201d Tim finally takes a bite of his turkey and cheese BLT, his preferred version, and chews slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose.\u201d Dick accuses, he\u2019s only here for the weekend because Bruce has gone into a weird depressive slump and asked not to go on patrol for two days to get himself back in order.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An injured superhero is one who can\u2019t patrol, and a hero who can\u2019t patrol is useless. They\u2019ve all been whipped into knowing their own body pretty well, knowing when they can\u2019t be trusted to dart across rooftops or dodge bullets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim, the bastard of a Robin he is, just shrugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick sighs, he\u2019s gonna have to make everybody sit through various \u2018how to emotion correctly in a family\u2019 videos again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Again </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s widely regarded the \u2018<em> best </em>\u2019 in the family at personal relationships and emotional intelligence, but he\u2019s honestly just trying his damndest and recalling various wikihow articles every time somebody comes up to him with a furrow between their eyebrows and questions that nobody should ever have to answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sends these wikihow articles to everybody in the cave, marked priority, with pictures, but he gets the sneaking suspicion that this whole family just skims those damn articles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick sends a prayer to whoever might be listening up there. He\u2019s too cynical to believe in god, not traditionally at any rate, but he knows too many entities and magical forces that could technically count so it\u2019s better safe than sorry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick stands, since he\u2019s lost control of his life at this point, and heads on over to a well used corner of the cave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cave is as sprawling as it is deep, so there\u2019s multiple levels with multiple sections- the most used ones are closer to the level that the car comes in at (level B-6) and the one closest to the house (B-1). There\u2019s an area tucked away between the two on B-4 that Alfred works in more often than anybody else, but it\u2019s very specific towards tailoring, maintaining, and updating the suits. It\u2019s packed full of adjustable dress forms and testing area\u2019s for bulletproof fabric, there\u2019s four tables, two sewing machines, and various molds for remaking their domino masks, and a whole dedication to various feathers and dye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick grabs ahold of one of the fireman poles that have been installed around the place, it warms under his hands and he inputs the correct press of his fingers to get to where he needs to go, quick like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim follows along, teeter-tottering in Dick\u2019s family colors and borrowed wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick can see that Jason\u2019s been down here, because there\u2019s just the most minor hint of a mess along the leather rolls- Bruce can\u2019t sew without supervision and Tim puts things back to an Alfred level of neatness when in community spaces. Jason\u2019s never been perfect at replicating the standards that their butler has pressed into the manor and cave, but he tries his darndest. There\u2019s been life here, like everywhere else in the cave, but Dick didn\u2019t come here for confirmation, he can here for <em> revenge </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been locked away, hidden into the darkest depths of this area where only Nightwing ever strays too in any frequency.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s footfalls are silent, as he\u2019s been trained, but Dick knows that Tim\u2019s not going to stray easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Underneath three layers of lead-lined boxes, Dick pulls out a box that\u2019s no larger than a shoebox.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is to be used without anyone else\u2019s knowledge.\u201d Dick warns, as seriously as he can. \u201cNo matter what Jason is branching out to, and what his costume looks like-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick passes the box, Tim gets his little hands underneath the lid almost faster than Dick can hand it to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Glitter </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Microfine, made out of eco-materials that dissolve in water, bought in bulk, designed to shimmer and shine like starry diamonds against anything that it gets put on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blue and black jars are very close to empty, Nightwing uses them pretty much bi-weekly, or after heavy thunderstorms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your <em> duty </em> , as a younger brother, to <em> wreak havoc </em> on Jason's new designs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new Robin\u2019s thin, shorter than both previous iterations, paler and covered in freckles where Clark can see the kid\u2019s skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s been brought up with Nightwing to go over both integration in the younger generation and to work with the computers up here. When asked about the previous Robin both of Batman\u2019s brood got quiet, looking at one another and humming notes in certain tones that must have meant something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing informs Superman that Robin II is currently trying something new, and would be back soon, probably.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman\u2019s not super convinced about the situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But! With the third Robin sitting in the observation deck and looking over satellite images of his home city, now is the perfect time for Clark to observe the differences between this new one and the rest of Batman\u2019s babies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that the man has ever called the Robin\u2019s his children, just partners or associates. Robin\u2019s have never called the man dad, just \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018Bats\u2019 or any one of a variety of nicknames. They could be unrelated, they most likely <em> are </em> unrelated considering they all look different enough in the body shape and jawline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it's very clear to see that this group of meta\u2019s are a family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boys all had dark hair, with Nightwing having dark, dark, dark brown, Robin II having a red like curling wine, and this new one\u2019s got a true oil slick <em> black </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This one\u2019s wings are also weird, strangely translucent at the tips and dyed in faded pastel instead of the vibrant glow of the previous iterations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well okay calling them <em> weird </em> was probably not exactly politically correct here, so Clark vanishes the thought from his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid is also stock still where his brothers were energy incarnate, so Clark only inspects Robin at a prefuncuarty few minutes before being slightly creeped out and having to leave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He goes to visit where Batman is leaning against the founders table and talking with Nightwing. The two of them have visited at three thirty am EST, or according to the watchtowers universal time, about seven thirty. The <em> only </em> four people up here were Superman, who was on watch due to his lack of needing sleep, Batman, Nightwing, Robin, and Firestorm, acting as general backup and secondary watch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman and Nightwing had said the visit was only going to last about an hour, before the tower got buisier, trying to ease the concept of the Justice League to a kid that doesn\u2019t move for hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman waves, and Nightwing\u2019s face bursts into a smile and he gestures for Clark to come on over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything interesting out there?\u201d Nightwing asks, he\u2019s sitting <em> on </em> the table cross legged, wings laid crisscross behind his back and limp on the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing more than a few minor things. Nothing that\u2019s our business.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hum from Batman, soft and rumbling. Agreement, a sound that\u2019s only heard when B\u2019s in a good mood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything interesting with y\u2019all?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides from your disastrous accent?\u201d Batman\u2019s in a <em> very </em> good mood, he\u2019s almost smiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really going to make fun of <em> my </em> accent when you\u2019ve been known to slip into a distinct Jersey one?\u201d Clark huffs a laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing <em> cackles </em>, a full throttle one that\u2019s full of mirth and youth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have not <em> once </em> slipped into a Jersey accent.\u201d Batman\u2019s a little offended, Clark can see it in the squaring of his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve used every accent in America <em> but </em> the accent of the city you protect- while the second Robin might have spoken in dozens of languages but up here he\u2019s always sounded like you picked him up from the streets of Gotham.\u201d Clark lets his own midwestern accent drawl around his words like it would back home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing laughs <em> harder </em>. The boy\u2019s own accent has always been a mixture, much harder to pin down, faint around his vowels. He laughs so hard that his wings perk up and flare out behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman rolls his eyes- a feat that\u2019s hard to pull off without actually having eyes visible but Clark\u2019s known Batman for a <em> very </em> long time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They chat for another thirty minutes, all of the words kind and full of laughter, before it\u2019s time for the winged meta\u2019s to go home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason meets with the people he\u2019s been terrorizing through technology.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s wearing a thick leather jacket, padded in his shoulders and elbows, a full thick hood over a helmet that\u2019s <em> red </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The red\u2019s the only color on him, the rest is blacks and greys, he\u2019s meant to be eye-catching, meant to be vibrant in a way that\u2019s aiming for <em> terror </em> in a distinctly different way than Batman and Robin can pull off. A face covered in nothing but a mask of blood, a full helmet to protect his still-healing skull, a flash of red the same shade on his gloves as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To distinguish himself as a totally separate entity from Batman and Nightwing and Robin, he wears visible holsters on his thigh, all four loaded with pistols that shine in the lowlights of the streetlamps. To distinguish himself as related to them, he still wears wings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The villains that have gathered here <em> know </em> that he means serious business, that this is a new unknown player who\u2019s got blackmail on every single one of them. A player who wears a mask and whose voice is distorted with mechanical coldness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hasn\u2019t given himself a name yet, he\u2019s going to let the people name him. There\u2019s not been enough superheroes out there who have been <em> given </em> their names, most overcompensating assholes simply announce themselves as one thing or another.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em> does </em>, however, already have a backstory for himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason always wanted to be a theater kid, always wanted to play his part in a play and be an <em> actor </em> , memorize his lines and quote King Lear to his entire school. He never got to be apart of the drama club due to his previous role as Robin, so now before he turns seventeen he\u2019s going to go absolutely <em> buckwild </em> - the most perfect way to make these villains both scared of ever going against him and in a double win make the myth of <em> Batman </em> even more terrifying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes a step forward into the dim lighting, the warehouse\u2019s flickering lighting throws even small shadows into sharp relief, making every soft curve sharp. \u201cI see you all are smart enough to answer my summons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Robin </em>.\u201d The whisper starts up from the back, they echo forward through the crowd of low level villains and street thugs and drug dealers. These are the people who supply the big names in Arkham, these are the people who keep the city from progressing overall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Wrong </em> .\u201d Jason gets his voice as low as he can, dark, dangerous, and with a <em> promise </em> of the pain he\u2019s experienced. \u201c <em> Wrong </em> , Robin <em> died, </em>haven't you heard? Robin got its head beat in by a joke in a clown costume.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowd shudders as one, looking back and forth to each other and falling back onto the <em> myth </em> of what Robin should be, what Robin <em> is </em>. Robin is the single bright burst of light in this fucking city, a burst of light that can\u2019t go out-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo any of you know what Batman <em> is? </em>\u201d Jason asks the room at large, \u201cDo you know where he came from, crawling out of the depths of hell by grasping onto the light of this world?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room of drug dealers lean forward again, they\u2019re looking at Jason\u2019s cape, Jason\u2019s <em> wings </em> . There\u2019s no information on Batman out there, nothing more than observable, now that Jason stands before these people that indisputable fact has <em> changed </em>. Whispers start back up again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin\u2019s not an angel.\u201d Jason cuts that train of thought off immediately. \u201cRobin is a <em> decision </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He flares his cape, a new look and style, a new <em> color </em>. He steps into the dull light, just to show off a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The whispers cut off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some people actually drop to their knees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new wings are ragged by design, taken from one of Bruce\u2019s own stash; the things are very clearly not the soft fluffy feathers of Robin. Bent and broken and jagged ribbing makes the bones appear <em> wrong </em> and <em> uncanny </em> , like they should hurt, like an arm twisted the wrong way around. No armour across the top like what comes standard on any other member of their flock, just taunting in its bareness. Thin membrane, the yellow fade that\u2019s been Bruce\u2019s look since Dick had been eleven had been taken off to be replaced with <em> blackness </em>. There are feathers, all of them dripping with a dark almost red synthetic oil that Jason hadn\u2019t added himself, but they bunch up at the very back, the scapulars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the wings flare at full length- nearly eighteen feet- the remaining feathers that come from Jason\u2019s back <em> glow </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hellfire, embers, sparking up in a deep yawning echo of the fury and pain that benched Jason for <em> so long </em>. A burn of rage that used to be channeled through the rooftops of the buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks like a demon, a perfect showing of mankind's mistakes. Hubris personified.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Tim had come up to Jason, nearly in tears, covered in glitter, apologizing that he couldn\u2019t give Jason what he had given Dick, but he did add something special. Jason nearly killed the kid with the resulting hug, because he looks fucking <em> terrorfying </em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin is shaped by this city, a nest egg, a child given wings unbidden.\u201d Jason steps forward again, more drug dealers and low life kneal, bow their head and ask for forgiveness. \u201cRobin is shaped by this city, her people, taken underneath the wing of a creature who sees everything and all. Robin is a reflection, shaped by the people around it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin becomes what this world, what this city, what <em> you </em> make it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason snaps his wings back behind him, movement quick enough to kick up the dust here, in this abandoned unholy ground by the docks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin died, congratulations people of Gotham, you\u2019ve wasted an opportunity for another protector-\u201d Jason pulls out the gun on his thigh, aims at a predetermined spot in the crowd, and <em> fires.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve gained a <em> villain </em> instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Family dinners are usually pretty tame. They don\u2019t eat in the dining room, that\u2019s much too formal most of the time, so they eat in a loosely gathered circle on the kitchen island. The dinners range from somebody picking up fast food to Alfred trying out a recipe he wants to have fun with. There\u2019s very little expectation at family dinners, beside \u2018<em> be there </em>\u2019 when you could. The dinner\u2019s aren\u2019t even an everyday thing, just once or twice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s here today, which only happens when his parents aren\u2019t home and the housekeeper isn\u2019t looking for him. Dick\u2019s at college in New York, he\u2019s close to midterms so he\u2019s stressing out and living in the library with his friends. Bruce is here, as he always tends to be, but Alfred\u2019s back in England because of an uncle\u2019s death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The meal is a relatively simple one prepared by Jason and Tim before Bruce got home- spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad. The bread is a little bit crispy on the edges but the middle still tastes great, the meal is large enough to support a high activity lifestyle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a great opportunity for Bruce to get caught up with his children\u2019s lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I hear you\u2019ve started a minor religion.\u201d Bruce says to his middle- and yet only legal- child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason pulls a face, groaning. Tim busts out into pitched breathless laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t <em> mean </em> to.\u201d Jason says. \u201cI wanted to be dramatic-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin has <em> shrines </em> up on rooftops now.\u201d Tim gets out through his laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd drug dealers don\u2019t deal to anybody under 18 and they have to run their shipments through me first!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling you <em> Phoenix </em>.\u201d Bruce tells Jason with no judgement or inflection in his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason flushes, a proud blotchy red. \u201cFuck yeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason repeats the exact same sentiment in French, because Bruce has lost control of his children when he let the first one go out in tights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like that people are leaving out food for us now.\u201d Tim eats like a bird during large meals, but he eats <em> consistently </em> throughout the day, always snacking on food in easy reach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat roof food.\u201d Bruce and Jason say together, slightly out of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat roof food.\u201d Tim\u2019s still laughing a bit. \u201cI eat the sealed things then I pack away the baked snacks and bring them back to the cave to test and if they\u2019re not dangerous <em> then </em>I eat the roof food.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason demands to know which roofs have the good snacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce wonders how his life has come to this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really a demon?\u201d Kal-El asks Bruce the next meeting up in the watchtower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bruce says, ignoring how nearly the entire team is listening into this conversation. They\u2019re on break, fifteen minutes of getting some food and taking a bathroom break halfway through the four hour discussion about what to do with the world government pushback to the Justice League.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sorta humiliating to be asked this question by literal aliens and gods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing some interesting things from Gotham.\u201d Kal tries again, the man is infuriatingly midwestern sometimes, he works to pry information from people the same way grannies at Sunday church service would. \u201cSome interesting things that pertain to you. I\u2019d still like you if you were really a demon B.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce has, unsurprisingly, been hearing the same sentiment. Sometimes from people in high society who like to talk more than they think and sometimes from street level informants and sometimes from his children who send him memes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Commissioner Jim Gordon also sends memes, he has long since discovered that the Batman is just a tired father trying his best)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman seems to say it a little more sincerely, about the whole \u2018<em> would still like you\u2019 </em> bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t just raise a perfectly plucked eyebrow, due to the cowl, so he cocks his head in the unspoken question instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman, Kal-El, just leans closer to Bruce where they\u2019re leaning against the small kitchenette in the upper deck of the watchtower. He smiles, dashingly handsome and full of the great American dream. Fuck, why is Superman so attractive, the man\u2019s an alien who lucked out in looking so close to human he\u2019s able to get away with getting the awe and love instead of the fear that J\u2019onn gets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce hates that he\u2019s so attracted to Kal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce also knows that Superman\u2019s going to get information no matter how much Bruce tries to put this off, with slightly more irritation each time he attempts. So instead of pissing off his best friend, Bruce simply says: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what interesting things might be true, if you get rid of the peanut gallery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The peanut gallery makes noises as they all take dives to get out of the way and let Batman and Superman talk. Flash, Diana, Arthur, John, all scatter from where they\u2019re hanging out right around the corner of the kitchenette, all of them attempting to use their very shaky views on stealth to act like they didn\u2019t ask Superman to do this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal laughs, bright and brilliant as he watches the rest of the upper leadership of the League scatter as casually as they can. Bruce just huffs a breath of amused air through his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal cocks his own head, eyes half mast as he listens to his teammates move further away from where the two men stand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce trusts Kal enough to be truthful here, the man\u2019s got an honor streak like nobody else in the whole League. Soon enough, Kal straightens back up and focuses his eyes again, finishing listening to whatever he can hear when he reaches out with his hearing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all scattered to the winds.\u201d\u00a0 Superman says, \u201cTell me about this new information we\u2019re hearing screaming across the criminal underbelly.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clearly not a fan of having questions turned on him, Kal raises a brow, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re a demon from hell and have been raising little hellions from Gotham\u2019s soul.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> am </em> raising little hellions.\u201d Bruce admits that while technically the only hellion that belongs to him, fully, is the second one he half raised, but all three of those little assholes eat his food and sleep at his house so he <em> claims </em> them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal laughs, this time much more contained and sarcastic. \u201c<em> Actual </em> hellions, not just your wonderful kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou only like two of them-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that the most recent one creeps me out a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin\u2019s a perfectly normal human child.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t reassure me when you say it like that, B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t know how to make it more reassuring, he said it in very distinct and clear cut terms here. \u201cAll three of my children are normal human children.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman sighs, but he\u2019s smiling. \u201cBats, how are you so smart in everything else but terrible in reassuring me that you\u2019re just a regular metahuman instead of something that shimmied up from below?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman isn\u2019t sure how to convince anybody with certainty of anything, anybody could be any sort of strange thing and hiding it under a veneer of a human facade. Kal himself was hiding behind a human facade, so how can <em> Bruce </em> simply say something and back it up with proof of everything without giving away his identity?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bruce decks Superman across the face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman rolls with the hit, so as to not break Bruce\u2019s fingers. Appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman just looks milly perturbed. \u201cBatman, want to explain <em> why </em> you just did that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I was magic, I would affect you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is proud of his rather simple logic here, from one step to another. There was nothing to stop at and explain along the way. Superman was vulnerable to magic, not vulnerable to Bruce, therefore Bruce isn't magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman sighs fondly, with soft eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d Kal says, he\u2019s smiling. \u201cWhy did you run a fake story in your city then? For intimidation?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHood did.\u201d Bruce has to fight the urge to rub his eyes now, calling Jason by the most identifying costume feature \u201cHe thought it was brilliant, he laughs when the goons take dives off roofs to avoid us. Robin also is having a great time with all the shrines that have popped up on the rooftops and windowsills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur lives are crazy.\u201d Superman laughs, he throws an arm over Bruce\u2019s shoulder and gets close, he smells like ozone and fresh cut fields, sunshine and summer. \u201cBut even if there\u2019s a whole lot of crazy, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re in it together.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phoenix Hood (what a fucking cool name, thank you random street thugs and drug dealers) quickly takes over the low lying criminals in Gotham. He\u2019s still a crime lord, still oversees and overlooks the dealings of illegal substances and weaponry, but he\u2019s got an iron grip on everything that passes through the <em> formerly </em> worst part of Gotham. Park Row is being referred to more and more as <em> Park Row </em> and not crime alley.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drug dealers get basic benefits now, and a living hourly wage instead of a cut of their personal profits, which incentivizes them to not have to sell as much. Hood also offers night classes in his warehouses, from teachers who are willing and wanting some extra money on the side. Park Row blossoms as the lowest on the totem pole, the most poverty stricken in Gotham, and has a steady, constant influx of cash available. People fix up their apartments and cars, they get their kids things for school and buy better food. If Hood gets proof that their children are consistently at school then the hourly wage goes up by a whole dollar and a half, if the parents get into rehab facilities or addiction help clinics then the pay goes up another dollar. Hood also runs a daycare in an empty apartment he rents out and pays three local women to give the best care they can to the kids that aren\u2019t old enough for school yet. Money goes directly from what these people are doing into their own pockets, because Jason doesn't need to take from the top.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody sells to anybody under eighteen under pain of severe beatings via Batman, Robin, or Hood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason also has badgered Bruce into staging fake fights, fake <em> visible </em>fights. Hood loses sometimes, as when these fights happen Batman actually uses these moments as for real spars, but Jason wins sometimes too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phoenix Hood and Batman are pretty evenly matched in pure head to head brawl, Bruce is bigger, taller and stronger, but Jason is younger, can take a hit better, and can predict his fathers movements. Jason still has the barest edge in speed, but every fight it\u2019s more and more pure power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s all quick movements, his bo-staff lending itself well to his naturally jerky motions and whip quick twitches. Tim\u2019s fast as hell, as younger people tend to be, but if Jason gets one hand on Tim then the fight is <em> over </em> . It\u2019s a war of attrition between them, Tim can outlast but can\u2019t outright <em> win </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes sure that his underlings follow him like ducklings, sticking to the only boss on the street that can resist the terrifying figure that is Batman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They still scatter when they hear Robin\u2019s echoey laughters come from above, ready to point out who\u2019s been naughty and breaking rules. They run in fear when Batman lets his silhouette be seen in flashes of lighting, screaming to the rafters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim <em> loves </em> combing through looking for anybody who steps out of line, he loves diving into it and micromanaging the finest details. Jason likes the bigger picture stuff, the ground level changes, the way this is shaping the neighborhood and the way people react to it. These are his former neighbors, the people who used to look out for him, and he is improving their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason listens to the people under him, has no right hand men or trusted close allies but he tells people to input their complaints and then goes over those complaints every other night and then fixes what he can.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is proud of Jason, he tells Jason so at the cave one night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason thinks the old man is reading right off those wikihow articles that Dick sends them all at four in the morning but he\u2019s <em> trying </em> and that\u2019s all that matters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman has noticed that Batman is a hell of a lot happier these days. He\u2019s practically a proud peacock whenever somebody mentions how Gotham seems to be doing really well nowadays.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man is practically preening, he\u2019s so proud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course when Superman has to go to Gotham to inform one of the bats that one of Metropolis\u2019s rouges has gone, well, <em> rouge </em> he doesn\u2019t actually expect to see any real life preening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But right there, on a ledge smaller than Clark\u2019s shoulders sits three birdies in a line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing sits up front, criss-cross applesauce with his hands on his ankles left wing spread over the side into the dizzy fall dozens of stories up while his right is fluffed up and leaned against the brick with his midnight tail tucked under him in a habit nobody else shares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin sits right behind him, hands straightening and pulling out sticks from Nightwing's hair and feathers. Robin\u2019s got quick deft hands, he sits close and his own wings are spread in a similar way, Robin\u2019s tail is short and wide but it\u2019s tucked flat behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phoenix Hood sits behind his brothers, gloved hands red as blood and a full facial helmet. Clark recognizes him by smell more so than sight now, the sound of his heart\u2019s the same as it\u2019s always been- just a little on the larger size.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boys look like a <em> wreck </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood has a <em> whole new set of wings </em> . What the <em> fuck </em>? They look like Batman\u2019s do, leather bat wings with a thin membrane and black paint splashed up on the bottom, the few feathers that are left stick stubbornly to his back-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?!\u201d Superman is not afraid of scaring these three, they probably knew he was coming by the changes in the air, but he can\u2019t help but rushing to help a boy he considers his nephew. \u201cWhat happened to your wings?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wing membrane is ripped, torn a hole right at the bottom of the left wing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal smells <em> blood </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Uncle Kal!\u201d Nightwing chimes from up front. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting back from a fight with Poison Ivy. None of us are seriously injured.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood pulls back his wings, snapping them closed and tight to his torso like Batman himself tends to do. Hood has the same metal tips to the thumbs of his wings- but the blood isn\u2019t coming from his wings- the blood smell is coming from both Robin <em> and </em> Nightwing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark has to know more, so he asks \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood picks a twig out of Robin\u2019s pale feathers, Robin snags leaves out of Nightwing's hair. Nightwing responds for all of them: \u201cB took a bad fall two nights ago so he\u2019s cave-bound for another two days. Poison Ivy took her shot at ruling the city parks sprinkler system tonight and halfway through we got a surprise visit from Mr. Robocop all the way from your side of town, Supes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not at all what Clark wanted to hear about, and these assholes know it. Bat-training makes all of them <em> insufferable </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Oh shit they\u2019ve already encountered him then. \u201cMetallo got out of Stryker's and headed for Metropolis\u2019s border, I didn\u2019t hear about this till tonight, he escaped two days ago. I was coming here to warn y\u2019all\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin pulls out another few leaves out of his brother's feathers. Hood takes an entire stick out of Robin's secondaries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cConsider us warned.\u201d Nightwing\u2019s sarcasm is not appreciated here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you want to be warned two of you are bleeding then? Or should I leave?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold it right there, Uncle Kal.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman watches all three of them, Nightwing\u2019s got a finger up as a \u2018<em> wait a second\u2019 </em> gesture, eyes narrowed behind his domino mask. Robin\u2019s completely frozen, the only sound coming from him is a soft heartbeat, his hands clawed but unmoving in Nightwing\u2019s glittery plumage. Hood\u2019s already moving, hands pushing <em> through </em> the pale feathers in front of him and onto his brother's side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark floats, his cape billowing around him as the flock begins accusing one another of hiding injury. Nightwing yells at Hood, who yells at Robin, who doesn\u2019t say anything but furiously begins to rip away the last few remains of plants anywhere he can reach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood eventually presses hard against Robin\u2019s left hip, making the boy make a little gasp of air, then <em> both </em> brothers turn on Robin and begin to fuss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, get on.\u201d Nightwing demands, going from an easy siting into a more stable crouch. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to fly when injured.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cut from one of Robocop\u2019s stupid punches.\u201d Robin pushes Hood\u2019s hands away, but Hood\u2019s a lot bigger and is trying to inspect the injury. \u201cBarely a scratch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood\u2019s right hand finally grips on, fully holding the entirety of his brother's side- Robin hisses out in a sharp inhale behind his teeth. Clark can smell the fresh blood ooze out from behind Hood\u2019s gloves, the sharp spike of pain smell. That\u2019s not just a scratch, it\u2019s deep enough to freshly bleed a whole new gush when grabbed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin!\u201d Hood can clearly feel the blood, the shape of the wound through the wings via touch. \u201cThat is <em> not </em> a scratch!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid falters a little bit, wavering away from the touch. \u201cIt sure as hell hurts when you grab it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d Nightwing snaps- gesturing to his own back. \u201cGet on we need to bring you to the cave-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin says something in what sounds like Russian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smartass and climb on.\u201d Hood picks up the youngest by his armpits and basically shoves him onto Nightwings back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s still the tallest by a barest inch- he\u2019s about to be surpassed by Phoenix Hood- so as the tallest, the biggest brother, he allows Robin to climb up between his shoulder blades and settle down safely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark watches, he smells blood stronger when Robin moves. It doesn\u2018t smell like anything life threatening, it smells like a decent amount but not anything that would kill immediately. \u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d It was his villain that did this, so he\u2019s partially responsible. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fly while injured- then Nightwing you shouldn\u2019t be flying either.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood <em> dives </em> at his brother, \u201cYou we\u2019re gonna fly injured <em> with a passenger?!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin holds tighter, as if on instinct, as Nightwing dodges on a ledge that\u2019s sixty stories above the asphalt and thinner than a foot and a half. \u201cYou can\u2019t fly yet at all! What the <em> fuck </em> did you think I was going to do to get us all down safely to the car?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two older ones scrabble at one another, words spitting quick between multiple languages. They start in English, Clark mostly thinks for his own benefit, but tumbles into about three different passes before it slips back into English again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSafehouse on sixth.\u201d Robin hisses into Nightwing\u2019s hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll sew up there and spend the night and go to the cave in the morning.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All three brothers just give each other <em> looks </em>, back and forth for a moment before Nightwing sighs deeply. \u201cUncle Kal, We need a favor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The safehouse on sixth is perfectly functional. It's not anything special, in fact is so outstandingly not-special that it's that particular quality that Clark notices the most. The kitchen appliances are neither new or outdated, but somewhere perfectly in between, the whole place is in black and white with minor hints of blues and bronze that make the place feel like a home without anything actually having a personal touch. There\u2019s no dust but there\u2019s no smell that layers itself around, minor cleaning chemicals aside, it doesn\u2019t smell like any of the bats do- it's more like a very clean hotel room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not any personal pictures, just art pieces in bold colors that are on blank walls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a guest book when you walk in, right by the bowl for the keys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark carries both Robin and Nightwing, tucked under his arms, to the couch in the living room that sits on the sixth floor of a fifteen floor apartment building located in the smack middle of downtown Gotham. There\u2019s two soft couches, so each injured boy gets one each. Robin lays down with perfect stillness, but Nightwing flings himself around to be comfortable. Their feathers were strangely stiff when Clark held them, there was a give but it wasn\u2019t as much as downy chicken or duck would be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s injury is on his side, but Nightwing\u2019s is on his upper inner thigh- Clark\u2019s not going to get anywhere near that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood is coming with the car, Clark had dropped him off to drive the batmobile to wherever they can park it here, so Hood\u2019s going to swing by and do the medical touchups.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If- okay if Robin\u2019s not up and moving with a static kind of determination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Clark has to ask. \u201cYou\u2019re injured.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting the medkit.\u201d Nightwing answers for his brother, \u201cBut he <em> better </em> not try and stitch himself up!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did that one time!\u201d Robin calls back from where he\u2019s moving to what appears to be one of the two\u00a0 bathrooms. \u201cThe stitches held!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark follows the kid, Robin moves in such a dedicatedly stiff way that Clark\u2019s never seen a child act like before it\u2019s <em> so </em> weird. Robin\u2019s wings are tucked against his back, his tail folded and hanging to his ankles. Sure enough, in the bathroom under the sink there\u2019s a rather large medical kit- a quick glance inside shows how well it's stocked. Clack takes it, not allowing Robin to bend down and agitate his wound further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin heads back to the living room, Clark follows right after.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your injury, Nightwing?\u201d Clark has to ask, \u201cDo you need immediate attention?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSluggish shallow tear, I got it when your metal asshole showed up and surprised me- Ivy has thorns I wasn\u2019t careful of.\u201d Nightwing\u2019s always wiggling, his hands flash up to his neck to touch the hidden zippers in his suit. \u201cHelp me out-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark does <em> not </em> want to do this, but Nightwing\u2019s already got the zip flushed out. Clark sighs and begins to help Nightwing out of his tight fitted armour. The zipper is small and strong, it doesn\u2019t snag once as it goes all the way down to-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another zipper, two actually, on the back- on either side of the wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark pulls those down as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp Robin out of his own suit.\u201d Nightwing says after Clark gets those two other zippers as far as they go. The suit falls down around him, revealing a tight black second skin underneath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The black second skin underneath sucks itself to the body, revealing every line and every curve. There\u2019s lines that flow up and down and around the torso, flowing into the palm and the back of the neck. Random circles of what looks like some kind of electronic system across the boy's torso.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin has a similar setup, a zipper down the front with two in the back that go down and around his wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an interesting freckle pattern- more distinct than all of the kid\u2019s other splatter paint freckles and hidden by Robin\u2019s high armoured collar- right at the base of the kid\u2019s throat. It\u2019s like the constellation, Lyra, with the freckle where Vega is meant to be as a large almost black one in a sea of browns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s also wearing an undersuit, but his armour is also in two pieces and not one like his older brothers. The black undersuit has the same pattern as his brothers, a living skin of electronic signals that travel from neck to hip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can hear the roar of a car coming up within three blocks, Hood is close enough that these two can figure themselves out without Clark\u2019s immediate help.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHood is almost here.\u201d He informs them, even though he can hear the electronic buzz of a voice through the coms that they wear. \u201cDo you need anything else from me right now?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin immediately shoots something in Russian, which makes Nightwing laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark just raises an eyebrow, he doesn\u2019t speak anything besides English, Kryptonian, and highschool level Spanish. He\u2019s not incredible with languages, they escape him in a way that numbers just <em> don\u2019t. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I wanted to be invincible.\u201d Robin half mumbles into the couch he lays on, bleeding onto. \u201cIt would help cut back on these kinds of moments.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Clark could give it to others, he would have, he would give his abilities to the people he loves in an instant. If he could protect Batman from all the pain tha man carries he <em> would </em>. Batman carries the weight of the world on his winged shoulders and Clark wants to keep everything he can off that man\u2019s plate if only to make it easier for Batman to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The car parks downstairs, the engine cuts off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHood is here.\u201d Clark says to the empty house, the one that nobody permanently lives in but has a stocked medkit anyway. \u201cDo you have something that\u2019s actually physically possible for me to help with?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet Metallo off the streets?\u201d Nightwing asks, \u201cWe killed all of Ivy's plants pretty well but couldn\u2019t contain a villian used to dealing with <em> you </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sips carefully at the champagne and tries not to think about how much he wants to strangle the woman in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her laugh is annoying, pitched in a way that's clearly aiming for \u2018cute\u2019 but missing by miles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a grand opening of a hospital tonight, in Metropolis of all places, but since the hospital is funded by Drake Industries and Wanye is one of their investors he has to make an effort to look like he vaguely gives a shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim and Jason have taken off into the crevices of the night- Dick\u2019s not here right now to wrangle them so god help whoever gets caught up in their mischief. This is only the second large function the two of them have attended with knowing everything between them- the first one Dick was there to mitigate the injuries but now Bruce is fully expecting for somebody to lose a spleen tonight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The upside is that it\u2019s a small gathering of the upper class and more focused on the doctors who are going to work here and the research that\u2019s going to be funded here. This is going to be a huge cancer treatment center, for both Metropolis and her sister city Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman in front of Bruce laughs again, pitched nasally. Ugh. Terrible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce!\u201d A voice calls, breaking through the one sided conversation-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce turns, and sure enough it\u2019s Drake, Jack Drake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJack!\u201d Bruce smiles and turns his whole body, effectively telling the woman that he was beginning to become uninterested. \u201cA wonderful party, we haven\u2019t been on this side of the bay for <em> ages </em> it feels like.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack laughs, deep and full bellied. \u201cI figured Metropolis would need a hospital, considering how many radioactive rocks are flying around.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce has done the research himself, Kryptonite only has harmful effects if exposed to for years at a distance of less than a foot and a half. It\u2019s a rare enough mineral on its own- more pricey than jadeite- so it\u2019s not going to get any kind of passive collection. There\u2019s only person who has a comparable store of Kryptonite to Bruce himself, Lex Luthor. The only place to obtain samples of this shit is from meteorites, very <em> specific </em>metorities, so there\u2019s really nobody just casually walking around with the rock that can kill Superman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bruce has cultured a very specific public persona, \u201cThank god our weirdo in tights is just some random asshole.\u201d He waves dismissively as the laughs start up around him, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have to do anything special to put that guy down.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack holds out his champagne, Bruce toasts it, they both take a large drink from their flutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman snuggles closer, what the fuck was her name again? Mary-something?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only good thing about Superman is that he doesn\u2019t get kids killed.\u201d Drake snipes, low and vicious, the Drakes have been very vocal about their dislike of Batman ever since the photo that their own son took began to circulate across the media.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s okay with that, he didn\u2019t do this to make friends. Bruce understands and ignores the public opinion of himself. He didn\u2019t <em> allow </em> any of his Robins to get into the fray, they just ignored him saying \u2018 <em> no </em>\u2019 and ran into the fight. Bruce might have well trained them not to die and keep an eye on them if his children run headfirst into gang wars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of kids-\u201d Bruce gestures to where the kids are meant to be during this party- in a whole separate room. \u201cHow\u2019s your own doing?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce knows how Tim Drake is doing, Tim spends eighty-five percent of his time at the manor. It\u2019s just a shared talking piece between the two of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake looks startled, as if he\u2019s either surprised that Bruce remembers he has a child or the man has <em> just </em> been reminded that he has one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bruce throws another bone- \u201cYour son is a few years younger than my youngest, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack brightens up considerably. \u201cYeah, Timothy\u2019s about eleven-\u201d No. He\u2019s twelve, almost thirteen. \u201c- and your son is seventeen?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy youngest is, yes, he\u2019s looking at colleges now-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The conversation spirals into basic family talk between the two of them as the night goes on. The woman who thought that Bruce Wayne would be an easy lay tonight sulks off after she can\u2019t pull attention back to herself (she\u2019s <em> Dick </em> \u2019s age, which is a very hard <em> no </em>).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They move on from family talk to business, Jack is incredibly proud of his company\u2019s work in third world countries. Jack and Jannet are at heart good people, they try their best and they like to study history and archaeology on the side as their hobbies. They\u2019re expanding medical equipment to make it more affordable for people who don\u2019t have as much, they\u2019re revolutionizing wheelchairs and prosthetics and treatment for maladies and disabilities all across the board. Wayne is proud to be a sponsor for Drake Industries, they\u2019re making a real difference.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heir to Drake's medical equipment empire is also on the ceiling,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce catches the hint of movement in his periphery and glances up for a moment. The beautiful deep red-brown wooden beams in this venue are mostly to hang lights and banners on, but they\u2019re also now home to two teenagers with too much time and not enough supervision. How did they even get up there? The way Bruce see\u2019s would put him in plain view of the party at large, but clearly his two sons are hell of a lot sneakier than he is apparently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The party peaks at just as night begins to fall, and begins to wind down before the press gets released to enter the fray.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The press is vicious, and will do anything to get a story, so if these parties didn\u2019t allow the presses in at all they would find a way to wiggle in that was under the table and less than wholesome. The press is allowed in at the last two hours, so then the people who are having affairs know to go home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good point to leave himself, but Bruce has made several attempts to call his children down discreetly but they are up there sprinkling water onto guests and ignoring Bruce\u2019s attempts to wrangle them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is pretty sure it\u2019s water, or champagne.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>Bruce <em> hopes </em> it\u2019s water or champagne.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The press that gets to filter into the party is full of nicer well established names, not any of those no-name hopefuls that stand outside with cameras and desperate to get a quote. There\u2019s a few that mill around but most reporters go right to who they want to talk too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one that rocks right up to where Jack and Bruce have been chatting, a man who\u2019s just a hair taller than Bruce himself with wider shoulders and a broad smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His press pass rests on a suit that\u2019s not too gaudishly cheap but nowhere near the style and expense of the suits worn by the actual rich people. Black hair, darker than Bruce\u2019s own, with huge glasses. Jack Drake seems to know- or at least expected- this reporter's presence because Jack reaches out with a handshake and a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The press pass says \u201c<em> Kent - Daily Planet </em>\u2019, Bruce makes a note of it as the man asks to ask a few questions. As Superman asks to ask questions. Bruce had known Superman\u2019s fake name, had seen a picture of the man before in this identity, but watching in real life technicolor is strange and new.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack Drake allows it, telling Kent to ask any questions about the new hospital they\u2019re opening soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fairly standard set of questions, designed to get an in-depth look at how this new hospital is going to affect Metropolis and the surrounding areas and what kind of cancer research is going to be going on. It\u2019s a good round, Kent\u2019s obviously thrilled to be here and asking after this kind of information and Jack Drake is thrilled to be answering them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce just sips at his bubbling water and listens in, occasionally making a joke but mostly enjoying not being the one asked anything for once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks up about halfway through the interview, and sure enough there\u2019s no sign of either Tim or Jason up on the wooden beams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce scans the crowd, he doesn\u2019t see any child hanging onto their parents legs. Or even just hanging out in the mingling mix underfoot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce wishes desperately that he had drunk more than two champagne flutes tonight. If he was at least tipsy then he wouldn\u2019t even realize what kind of bullshittery those two can get up too unseen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost to the end of the interview with Kent - Daily Planet - Superman that the two show back up. Jason\u2019s hair is perfectly in place (the place where his skull was sewn back together after Joker cracked it has grown back a brilliant white-blonde, it draws attention when styled) and there\u2019s not a wrinkle in Tim\u2019s suit jacket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce claps Jason on the shoulder, discreetly dusting off the bit of dust right at the curve of Jason\u2019s jacket. Too tall for Tim to see naturally and just in Jason\u2019s blindspot. Tim doesn\u2019t come up above Jason\u2019s elbow but the two of them did a great job disguising the fact that they\u2019ve been up to something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only really obvious tell is- \u201cWhere are your ties?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither boy blinks, their bowties have disappeared, leaving their collar\u2019s open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim disengages from Jason and heads over to bump against his father\u2019s hip, all soft smiles and innocent blinking. Jason rests his own head against Bruce\u2019s own shoulder, linking their elbows together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh they\u2019ve done something dangerous, acting this sweet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kent blinks down at Tim, not focused on Bruce and his ward at all but entirely on the two Drakes in front of him. \u201cCute kid?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t hold back a snort of laughter. That\u2019s the exact tone of voice that Superman speaks to Robin in, Superman clearly isn\u2019t used to children and it shows in such obvious ways. The poor man is out of his depth with people under sixteen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It definitely doesn't help that Tim is particularly strange to interact with. Tim jerks his head up, staring at Kent with big, unblinking, pale eyes. There\u2019s no fluidity in Tim\u2019s movements, just a sudden pop from one to the next with no in between, it makes him a rather unsettling person to talk to if you\u2019re not used to it, the fact that he\u2019s so young only makes the uncanny factor that much more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kent wants to take a step back, his body language goes stiff and panicked when he looks down to see a child randomly and simply <em> there </em>. This is hilarious. Jason gives a little tug, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jason asks into Bruce\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m tired and Dick\u2019s gonna be at the house when we get back.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce downs the rest of his sparkling water. \u201cSure, call Alfred and get the car around.\u201d Jason bolts, he\u2019s gone faster than he normally darts out of these events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Jack Drake, Bruce gives a limp wave and bids his goodbyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not going to be anywhere near here when whatever the boys have planned goes off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is kinda panicking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sort of accidentally stumbled upon <em> Robin </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a second to even realize the kid was <em> there </em>. Which was terrifying to just look down and realize a whole extra person was there, Clark can count on one hand the number of people who can sneak up on him and having one appear in full technicolor life while not in a super suit is kinda jarring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark looked down when Jack Drake moved his arm, casually looking at the movement like all people tended to do when others moved around. It\u2019s a simple reactionary habit long since evolved into prey animals. Nothing strange about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until Clark had registered that there was a whole ass <em> child </em> there where a moment ago there was nobody at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus Chirst.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was nobody that could just very casually sneak up on super hearing, it was a certain kind of dedicated training to get away with it. While children naturally had lighter footfalls than adults, no untrained random individual would be able to startle Superman\u2019s senses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that, Superman had taken a good hard <em> look </em>at what he assumes is Jack Drake\u2019s kid, trying his best not to peel away and bolt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Clark notices that right at the base of the kid's throat, mixed in with the rest of the kid's freckled face, is a very distinct freckling pattern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lyra, with the bright star Vega a black pin in a field of brown stars in a sky of translucent white. The same mark that Robin had had sitting in the same position at the base of his throat, right in the hollow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Clark instantly flares his senses, taking in every single molecule that occupies the spaces around them. The kid smells like Robin does- kevlar, that non-newtonian fluid that hardens with impact that sits in the Batsuits, dye packets and old blood, warm leather and wet rock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But no <em> wings </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where the <em> fuck </em> are the wings. The pale colors and trailing feathers when he walks, the rustle of almost silent whistle of down, the <em> whole extra appendages </em> . People don\u2019t just gain and lose whole fucking <em> limbs </em> without serious complications from it. The boy doesn\u2019t smell like fresh blood- just an old wound from a week ago when Clark helped him to the safehouse. He moves with no pain, when he moves at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just \u2026 a perfectly normal child.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not a meta at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just, a normal human.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What the <em> fuck </em> is going on here?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack Drake ruffles his kids hair. Clark looks back up at the father and immediately takes him in too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wrong shape, this isn\u2019t Batman. It\u2019s too heavy in the hips and lower half without nearly the same width in the shoulders, not the same skintone- the kind of tan that very pale people get when out in the sun for an extended time, not the naturally darker color that Batman\u2019s jaw is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This man, the father of Robin, isn\u2019t Batman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Batman <em> was </em> here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the lingering scent of the man, both on Robin <em> and </em> Jack Drake, recent and new.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why the fuck was Batman here? Why the-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who was talking to Jack Drake while Clark was asking questions? It was a guy, tall, Clark had noticed the man was fit, low heart rate, but other than that he had been here to do a job and question Jack Drake about the new hospital he wasn\u2019t focused on much anything here besides basic information gathering, his thoughts were a million miles away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTimothy here gets his looks from his mother.\u201d Jack is saying, all smiles and chemically brightened teeth. \u201cBut his brains are all me, you got any of your own?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Timothy doesn\u2019t look much anything like Jack Drake, no reddish blonde hair and brown eyes and easy smooth movements. The kid\u2019s all Robin, through and through now that Clark is looking at him, Clark knows that all three of the Robin boys are smarter than most but Clark hasn\u2019t gotten the same idea about Jack during the interview.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark looks across the room to where Jannet Drake stands at the bar, a tall slim woman with black oil slick hair and translucent skin and freckles across her nose and shoulders. She\u2019s got a quick small smile and it's rumored that she\u2019s both the beauty <em> and </em>the brains of the whole medical company, no reporter can get anything out of her- Clark had tired earlier tonight but she had smiled brilliantly and blinked her pale blue eyes and had told Clark to go speak to her darling husband.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark had listened to her, because there\u2019s nothing Clark will listen to faster than somebody who is so incredibly sure of themselves and their place in the world telling him <em> exactly </em>what to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If their glare can flay him in four seconds flat, that\u2019s pretty incintiving as well, squared shoulders and a jawline like a knife, with a nice mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jannet Drake had fit Clark\u2019s type to a capital T- she had told him off with such a sly and slick force that Clark had pivoted and decided to try and pry information from the weaker link.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jannet, Louis, Lana, Batman. Clark sometimes thinks he's got a problem with who he takes a double look at, all people who can flay him open with a word and will put a hand on his chest and push him down even when they know they can\u2019t physically move him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any children of my own, sir.\u201d Clark answers Jack\u2019s question. He hasn\u2019t interacted with any children besides the ones the Justice League bring around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jack just laughs. \u201cMore trouble than they\u2019re worth, the little bastards, you gotta love 'em though!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that, Clark hears a sound from above.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A tinkling, glass sound, loud enough that it should be audible for a regular human. IT\u2019s a hell of a lot of glass sounds that are echoing around the ceiling and banging it against other glass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everybody in the entire hall looks up, some seventy odd people all distracted momentarily by the noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everybody but Robin, who ducks right under his father\u2019s very nice suit jacket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Champagne falls from the rafters, all at once, millions of raindrops of sweet smelling alcohol all falling down at once from every single piece of the wooden rafters that sit above the entire party. There must have been hundreds, maybe thousands of glasses filled to the brim with champagne up there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark lets it hit him, like all of the other screaming rich guests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s hair is full of champagne, he sits alone in his apartment looking at his laptop with a glare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s almost no information on the Drake Heir, Timothy, but Clark has done his best anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s minor mentions but not even a clear photograph, just slightly fuzzy ones that are years old of Jannet Drake holding onto her young son and smiling to the camera. Nothing definite, nothing that can be found legally <em> or </em> illegally. Clark digs up every single bit of information he possibly can, the only thing that comes up is nothing, but puff pieces and feel good articles every half a year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is Robin, and where Robin is Batman follows close behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark combs every <em> bit </em> of the Drake line, trying to find Batman through pure wit just like Batman did to him. The man\u2019s a father figure to all three of his boys but- clearly not biologically related but there should have been some kind of connection here. There\u2019s <em> nothing </em> . The kid doesn\u2019t even have <em> godparents </em> to look into, every housekeeper has been the wrong age range, there for too short a time period, or a woman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not anyone close to the family, there\u2019s no uncles or long lost brothers or friends that fit the profile. The Drakes are gone from Gotham more than they\u2019re in it-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark blinks. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Robin\u2019s in Gotham almost every night for patrol with two random days off a week. Hood and Nightwing are more sporadic, Nightwing mostly tied up with Bludhaven and Titans missions, the boy is rarely seen in his childhood stomping ground. Hood is off the books more than anything else, dealing with criminals either publicly by hanging them off buildings to scream into the night or privately by helping them get highschool diplomas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Robin is a constant pressure, a constant presence, at his fathers side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the Drakes aren\u2019t in the country, but their son is?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do they leave him alone at their home? A twelve year old boy all by himself? They can\u2019t be, there has to be something that Batman has set up for his child when the boy isn\u2019t being Robin-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark sighs, and begins to craft up permissions to send to Perry to get started on an article that nobody\u2019s going to like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce gets cornered at the watchtower, it\u2019s early enough in the morning that the tower is full of nothing but emptiness and Superman, <em> apparently </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce was up here for a routine maintenance check, easy enough to press the \u2018run\u2019 button on the watchtower computer and watch the world spin underneath you until the computer makes a noise to let you know it\u2019s all done then you make sure everythings okay and call it a day. Takes about three hours and a bit of boredom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s children have Gotham for a while, he trusts them not to blow anything up that doesn't deserve it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, he trusts Dick- no, there was that diamond store that the woman grabbed him inappropriately. He trusts Jason- no, there was that warehouse he got tortured in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim hasn\u2019t had anything terrible happen to him yet?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s the most likely to twitch to his toys during a fight however.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce might come back to some buildings razed to the ground, but he trusts the boys to keep it minimal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But now he\u2019s up at the watchtower, about 3 am EST, with Superman floating in front of him, arms bracketing him in on either side of the kitchenette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The red cape brushes like silk against Bruce\u2019s shins, it\u2019s a rather large cape made out of a material that Bruce has never been able to identify by sight alone. Kal\u2019s eyes from this close show just how alien he is, with hexagon pupils blown wide and blue eyes a color unlike any human alive, dancing back and forth with colors that shift when Kal eyes shift through his visible spectrum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know who Robin is.\u201d Kal whispers, low and soft and <em> confused </em> . \u201cI know who your son is by total mistake but I can\u2019t figure out <em> you </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce freezes, his blood goes cold in his heart. How did this happen? <em> How did this happen? </em> He\u2019s been so careful, about every single damn thing, his children most of all. \u201c <em> Were you looking </em>?\u201d He can\u2019t help but snarl out, his chest tight and panicked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bruce\u2019s mind is already coming up with a million errors, a million ways this has all gone so wrong, a million fucking ways that his family is now in <em> danger </em>. He\u2019s panicking, there\u2019s all these contingency plans that spring from his mind, all from the darkness in his heart that tells Bruce to work constantly, the voice that tells Bruce to make all those plans and comb over every single bit of crime scene to know every single bit of information.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t- he knows normally how to <em> deal </em> with the stupid fucking voice in his heart screaming at all hours of the day that he needs to be <em> doing </em> something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em> fuck </em> tipped you off?\u201d Bruce hisses, in his chest. \u201cHow do I make everyone <em> safe </em>again?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal\u2019s hands come up, Bruce stiffens all at once but goes back into his normal stiff posture when Kal\u2019s hands just slip around to hold Bruce\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt was a total freak accident.\u201d\u00a0 Kal says, then proceeds to tell Bruce <em> exactly </em> how everything had happened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A random chance at a party, a sight caught during an injury where the undersuit doesn\u2019t cover up their necks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s brain is immediately jumping on him to tell the boys to wear makeup while they patrol too, not just to cover up scarring during parties and photographs. Fuck. He <em> knew </em> his boys had spots- Dick\u2019s got moles and a beauty mark, Jason has scars more so than anything else, and Tim is head to toe covered with dots- but everything on his older boys were covered with their uniforms, their masks, shirts and jeans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s beauty mark under his left eye was always covered, so Bruce never asked him to cover it with makeup during patrols. Four years later, Jason\u2019s skin was free and clear besides a birthmark on his ankle, so Bruce had never worried about it. Four years after that Tim had come along, and after eight years of not being worried about the state of his son\u2019s skin while patrolling Bruce had simply added opaque armor to Tim\u2019s freckled legs and told Tim what he told the other two.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any scars needed to be covered, any bruises needed to be covered, anything that affected medical history needed to have a story. Public appearances made Dick sew up a massive cut on his ear and keep his hair long enough to cover it. Public appearances made Bruce crash a car on his property and rush Jason to an emergency room with the story of driving practice. Public appearances made it so that Bruce himself got airbrushed makeup across his scarred torso before he staged paparazzi getting shirtless shots of him at clubs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody remembered the distinct pattern of Batman\u2019s scar on his lip when Bruce had been fighting them. Nobody was chatting about Nightwing\u2019s scarred ear. Not a criminal alive saw a scrap of flesh on Hood, but there was no chatting about how sometimes Hood walked with a limp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The insane at Arkham didn\u2019t chat about how Robin had <em> freckles </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce knew. He had been keeping track of what they talked about during their incracations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the people at the Justice League had seen Bruce\u2019s whole family in brilliant white lights up at the watchtower, during meetings and gatherings and parties. Flash had commented on Bruce\u2019s scar across his lip- asking if it affected how he ate. Diana had <em> tsked </em> when Dick- in his last few months as Robin- had come in with stitches in his ear and his hair tied back to help it heal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour masks cover up nearly everything.\u201d Kal is saying, Bruce latches onto the words trying to keep his panic at bay. \u201cI only saw it because of crazy circumstances that are never going to be replicated again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be <em> sure </em> of that.\u201d Batman tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal squeezes Bruce\u2019s shoulders, brows furrowing, he looks so ready to argue, so ready to tell Bruce\u2019s broken brain that everything is alright not to worry about a thing. But then he relaxes his grip and looks down. \u201cI thought I was <em> sure </em> you had wings, but I\u2019m wrong about that too aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Fuck </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce surges forward, into the crook of Kal\u2019s neck, there\u2019s too much happening here on ground that\u2019s not Bruce\u2019s own. It makes his brain scream, panic, and surge for Bruce to find some kind of safety.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nowhere safer than Kal\u2019s arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman curls into a hug, allowing Bruce to take all the time he needs to quell the flare of desperate panic that beats against his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just- just fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce grips the fabric or Kal\u2019s cape, the alien silk beneath thick very human armoured gloves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to leave.\u201d Bruce says, quick and low so nobody can overhear him but Kal. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t talk about this here, his mind won\u2019t let him feel safe here, won\u2019t let him<em> breathe </em> here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal follows, easy as he ever does, like he <em> always </em> does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the kitchen they make their way to the teleporter, Bruce couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about finishing the updates right now, and Bruce taps in his own coordinates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal\u2019s breath catches, his blue eyes impossibly, alien, wide. \u201cB, you don\u2019t have to reveal yourself to me just because-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The zeta beam cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is sort of panicking. He screwed his eyes tightly shut when the zeta had gotten ahold of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman, whoever he was under the hood, had snagged him and dragged him somewhere presumably in Gotham where he had tapped out specific coordinates that weren't built into the teleporter. Batman\u2019s zeta let him out on the big Wayne building, like Clark\u2019s own let him out on the Daily Planet, but this was- this was probably Batman\u2019s <em> home </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t see anything through his own eyelids- not without conscious effort- but he could still hear, he could still smell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hear the way that the sound echoes around, high ceilings with many offshoots. Somewhere with tunneling lines of impossibly long winding chambers that had <em> animals </em> in the corners. Chittering animals that talked amongst themselves with layered amusement. Water, somewhere, a rushing river of freshwater and below that there\u2019s a mildly brackish bay, drops of water all around- distantly, constantly. The hum of electricity much closer, the whirring of air circulation, the temperature down here cooler than regular outdoor temperatures. There\u2019s sounds of <em> actual </em> wind, real life and sputtering in a way that\u2019s definitely not controlled by any kind of man made device.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the smell of blood, kevlar, and leather, the pounding heartbeat of his best friend, the sound of movement, a tug on his wrist to lead him forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The smell of food here, somebody\u2019s got some kind of baked goods close by, old blood from a sterile clean bleached area- medical bay?- general cleaning supplies, wet warmed stone. There\u2019s no smell of polished wood here, all metal alloys and glass. Amazingly clean in the lived in area, for how many bat\u2019s must live in this same cave system. The smell of dye and of chemicals and of people, there\u2019s two slow roaming heartbeats by what must be the computer, a heart a little on the larger side and a heartbeat that sticks slightly on every third <em> ba-thump </em>. Hood and Nightwing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB!\u201d Nightwing moves, the fabric on him doesn\u2019t sound like his uniform does- there\u2019s no sounds of leather pulling as he twists, just the soft rustle of cotton.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been had.\u201d Batman rumbles, low and deep from his chest, there\u2019s the sound of more fabric rustling and then when Batman continues with a \u201cI needed to have this conversation someplace more secure than the watchtower<em> . </em>\u201d There\u2019s no sound of electronics in his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is very happy to report that he won the bet between him and Diana, B\u2019s voice really <em> is </em> that deep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d Hood grumbles, his voice also isn\u2019t affected by the electronics he\u2019s been using recently, just his own regular rough cadence. \u201cNone of us are wearing <em> masks </em> B.\u201d <br><br>Clark screws his eyes shut a little tighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Robin?\u201d Batman asks. Stopping. Clark follows the stop, halting as soon as Batman halts his forward momentum. \u201cI need all of you down here for this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven A?\u201d Nightwing sounds worried. \u201cBoss what <em> happened </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2019s going to get revealed tonight if he\u2019s here or not, let the man stress bake.\u201d Batman says, then more movement. \u201cYou can open your eyes, Kal.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal shakes his head. \u201cI only figured out one of you- not everybody.\u201d He can\u2019t betray Batman\u2019s trust, it\u2019s been so ingrained into his head that it just keeps replaying on repeat. \u201cYou figured me out fair and square, but I haven\u2019t done the same to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A gasp, that\u2019s from Nightwing. \u201cHe figured out <em> Robin? </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been either of us.\u201d Hood agrees, \u201cWe\u2019re a sure shot to B, you figure out any of us and the game\u2019s over, but Robin\u2019s not publicly connected to the three of us. It\u2019s got to be Robin.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his parents.\u201d Nightwing informs the room. \u201cDinner- they\u2019re leaving tonight, just in town for a few hours while passing through.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark winces, he didn\u2019t want to believe that Robin really was left alone that often but from the very casual way that Nightwing spits the word <em> parents </em> Clark assumes that everyone is aware of the situation that\u2019s happening in Robin\u2019s real life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d he make us?\u201d Hood asks. \u201cJesus Uncle Kal, you can open your eyes. If B brought you down here and took off the cowl he clearly trusts you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Holy shit Batman took off his <em> cowl?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Clark has to ask, \u201cOnce I open my eyes and you introduce yourselves I can\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another sound of movement, Batman squeezes Kal\u2019s wrist. Hood laughs, Nightwing gives a giggle. \u201c<em> Introduce </em> ourselves?\u201d He whispers quietly to his brother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal opens his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks down at first, to see his own feet in the dim light of the cave. He slowly, <em> carefully </em> begins to look up to meet his best friends, his crushes, eyes catching Batman, backlit by computer screens and-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman is <em> beautiful </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Black hair, a patch of grey at his temple, blue eyes like the ocean at midnight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark doesn\u2019t think he can <em> breathe </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s got cheekbones to die for, his short hair is slicked back and pushed out of his face, but stray strands fall down around his forehead where they\u2019ve been disturbed by the cowl. God, Batman\u2019s got <em> ears, </em> which shouldn\u2019t surprise Clark at all but he\u2019s never <em> seen </em> them and there\u2019s a silver studded earring in both and they\u2019re pink flushed at the top. Batman has <em> eyebrows </em> , thick and dark and so perfectly manicured. It\u2019s Batman\u2019s <em> eyes </em> that catch Clark the most, all dark deep blue that just pull him under the ocean waves even further and make Clark want to lean forward and just-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman looks expectant, a small smile on his lips and one of those polished eyebrows quirked up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s never seen this man before in his life why would Batman look <em> expectant </em>, like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop and for Clark to jump up and gasp something ridiculous like the heroes in the movies always did when the veil between them was stripped away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But now that Clark\u2019s looking for something, Batman does sort of \u2026. No. No, that\u2019s not possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark looks at the two boys behind their father, the same height even with three and a half years between them, with their incredibly <em> distinct </em>faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Hood never showed his hair because that streak of white that follows his hairline is in the exact same place as Jason Todd\u2019s new looks that are all over instagram and twitter- it\u2019s become a trend. Nightwing has a mole right under his left eye, blue and shining with mischief and <em> exactly </em> like how Richard Grayson shows up in the news on fashion walkways and gala\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce Wayne- the very famous Bruce <em> fucking </em> Wayne stands tall wearing the Batman suit right in front of Clark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Wayne family who are constantly in the background of every news station, the royal family of America, their faces are on every single news outlet on every single moment of every single day. They\u2019re happy-go-lucky morons who tweet out things like \u2018<em> we\u2019ve run out of banana\u2019s for bread i will pay somebody 100$ right now </em> \u2019 and \u2018 <em> stupid positions we\u2019ve found out dad sleeping in a thread 1/27 </em>\u2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Wayne family, who might be handsome and fit, but <em> don\u2019t have wings </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHas anybody told you three you look <em> remarkably </em> like the Wayne\u2019s?\u201d Clark manages to squeak out, desperately hoping to be wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman- <em> Bruce Fucking Wayne </em>- just smiles wide, and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s pretty happy. His family had a nice dinner, his mother had kissed his head and told him to be a good boy, and his parents had left to go to Central America.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was always a good boy, never causing trouble and protecting the streets of Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He might have gotten a few broken ribs and has had three dental replacements and major damage to his liver and kidneys with all the poison, but he\u2019s been very good!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He puts his shoes away in the foyer, tucking them under Jason\u2019s and right next to Dick\u2019s. There\u2019s voices coming from the preferred parlor, Jason\u2019s loud laugh and Dick\u2019s softer giggles. It was just about time to head down to the cave for the evening to get patrols and look into the new shipment of drugs at the dock, but Tim\u2019s willing to go to where everybody was for now instead of heading right for the computer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room was one of the smaller parlors, and when Tim opens the door he sees Dick and Jason, pushed up together on the couch and sniping at one another, Bruce on the armchair smiling at-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who was this?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wearing Bruce\u2019s workout clothes, looking slightly awkward in clothes that are just a little oversized on Bruce but undersized on this new man-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman, this is Uncle Kal, sitting very casually on a loveseat and looking like he always does when Tim see\u2019s him- vaguely lovesick at Bruce.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Which is gross, ew, old people love.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason pats the couch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been had Timmy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s blood goes cold. They\u2019ve been <em> had? </em>\u201cBy whom? Do we need to go into lockdown protocols? Are they going to attack the manor?\u201d Tim hops up to sit next to Jason. If Superman is here then they\u2019ve been had by somebody real bad-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuperman played connect the dots with your freckles asshole.\u201d Jason tells him. \u201cWe\u2019re here to gently break the news to him that B\u2019s a rich bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick hits Jason in the arms, slugging him. \u201cThat\u2019s how you had to say it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uncle Kal winces, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that simple-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce cuts him off \u201cTim, we\u2019re going to get back to using waterproof makeup while on patrol, but for now don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t clasp his hands over his cheeks, it wouldn\u2019t do any good now anyway, but he feels the urge to hide away anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKal, has promised not to tell anybody in the League.\u201d Bruce says. \u201cOur identities are still fairly safe, we\u2019re going to update some of our contingency plans and talk about what this means going forward.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean <em> you\u2019re </em> going to talk about it with Uncle Kal while <em> we </em> go on patrol.\u201d Dick makes wild motions with his hands, gesturing between the older two men and the younger kids. \u201cJason and I did nothing wrong, we\u2019re taking Tim with us because we all sit at the kid table together, solidarity.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou haven\u2019t sat in the kids room during gala\u2019s in years.\u201d Bruce tells him. \u201cThis involves everyone, it\u2019s a family conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick stands anyway. \u201cYou can fill me in later.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Richard Grayson </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do dangerous things with criminals!\u201d Dick says, his hands up in the air. \u201cI am one semester away from graduation and twenty years old! I refuse to be full named here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to smooth over misconceptions before they can affect us on the field-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stands too, hands going under Tim\u2019s armpits and lifting him up with only a minor grunt. \u201cOnly one guy needed to explain everything, we\u2019re outta here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce was using his children as buffers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was easier to talk with them around, easier to talk in his own safe haven than someplace like the watchtower or in public.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s almost dawn, the sky\u2019s lightening over Gotham in the distance, all pinks and purples and hazy midnight blues. The huge bay windows let in every single hint of light from the forest outside, they had come up from the cave to make Kal a little more on even ground with everyone else. They also had to convince him that this house was under pretty constant barrage from surprise cameras so <em> Superman, Kal-El </em> couldn\u2019t sit and causally have a conversation in the middle of the Wayne manor without potential hitbacks from the media, so instead it had to be mild-mannered Clark Kent sitting on the couch and talking about what they both knew now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you let us believe for so long you were a meta?\u201d Super-<em> Clark </em> asks, very little emotion in his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce winces, he\u2019s not sure how much shows on his face, \u201cI never said I was a metahuman.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh that wasn\u2019t the right thing to say, as soon as the words are out Bruce wants to die a little. He holds up a single finger, <em> wait </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark allows the time, letting Batman find the exact words he wants to say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a practiced speech, this isn\u2019t the careless public persona where words don\u2019t <em> matter </em> . Bruce has to choose each word so fucking <em> careful </em>, each weighed with meaning, some of them not even English, there\u2019s thousands of words and all of them aren\u2019t right for this. LIfe doesn\u2019t give you second chances, once something is said it\u2019s out there and forever in somebody\u2019s else\u2019s mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bruce starts at the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It started as a joke, and evolved into something more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Batman had entered the Justice League it was already a well established part of the costume, the wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everybody had just <em> assumed </em> and Flash felt more at ease with Batman and other meta\u2019s than people like Superman and Wonder Woman and it was easier just to go along with the assumptions then to correct and explain and give away that he didn\u2019t just have a lot of resources to be well equipped but he also could design, make, and keep under wraps the fact he made single powered flight possible-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet I look weird to you without it.\u201d Bruce says, shifting his shoulders that always feel a little too light without the cape and cowl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark actually <em> blushes, </em> that ruddy red-purple color he turns when embarrassed. \u201cYou- uh- it\u2019s a change, but you don\u2019t actually look like <em> Batman </em> right now?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Raising an eyebrow, Bruce just waits for an explanation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark seems <em> really </em> embarrassed now, sitting in Bruce\u2019s soft clothes in his parlor and listening to the sounds of the forest outside wake up. \u201cYou look like a celebrity, so it\u2019s sort of weird to see you <em> not </em> in a magazine or on the TV. It\u2026 I know in my brain that you\u2019re my best friend of nearly ten years but my eyes are seeing ... \u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sighs, this is why he hasn\u2019t told anybody in the League. They wouldn\u2019t believe him, then once they did believe him they would freak out and treat him differently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing!\u201d Clark tries to back up, throws his hands palms up. \u201cI\u2019m just getting used to the \u2026 to seeing you without wings. Without the costume.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to seeing you without the big red <em> \u2018S\u2019 </em> either.\u201d Bruce had given the face in the file a good long look when he had first discovered- on accident- who Superman was underneath the cape. But he wasn\u2019t used to talking just one on one with no leather between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark huffs a laugh. \u201cWhat a pair we make, too used to Halloween costumes. It\u2019s weird to be able to look one another in the eye.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It <em> is </em> weird, for both of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce think\u2019s Clark looks smaller without the red alien silk cape around his shoulders, the instinctive puff of his chest and the confident stance. Clark and Kal-El are two separate ways of standing, of sitting, Clark curls in on himself and tucks his feet together, one over the other while Superman hasn\u2019t ever apologized for taking up too much space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it be better, if you knew how it worked?\u201d Bruce has to ask, that always made <em> him </em> feel better about things. He liked taking things apart and finding out why each part was what it was, filled into the blanks of his knowledge, eased the tightness in Bruce\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark smiles, weakly. \u201cA little bit?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is going to have a <em> heart attack </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman- <em> Bruce </em>, Clark knows B\u2019s name now and he\u2019s not over that fact yet- stands in the cave for the second time tonight. He\u2019s wearing such a thin black undershirt, the underlayer that has all those nodes and wires that bunched up around his waist just a bit and trailed up enough to see a sliver of skin before the soft sweatpants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is explaining, he doesn\u2019t meet Clark\u2019s eyes very often but that\u2019s okay. Each node apparently is a haptic sensor, relaying information across the entirety of Bruce\u2019s torso in varying degrees according to a complicated system of information that nobody but a man as fastidious as Batman would bother with memorizing and then training into three other people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce turns, his back facing Clark, brushing up the wisps of hair on his neck to really show off the system. He\u2019s still talking, rattling off numbers and ohms and how it was all connected and how far apart each haptic had to be to be recognizable. Clark has stopped paying attention, all focused on Batman\u2019s <em> back </em>, they\u2019re only two feet apart, Clark can see each swell of muscles underneath the skin, muscles that have never been seen before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The curve of B\u2019s spine, not hidden at all and exposed to Clark\u2019s hungry gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c-the haptics right at the base of my skull also acts as the activation and deactivation button, easily reachable. Want to turn on the haptics?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark swallows. \u201cSure?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce twists his head back, the viens in his neck stand stark, eyes such a fucking pretty color. \u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry! I want to, yes. Please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce blinks, slowly, before he twists back to expose the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark reaches out, using one hand to brush up the hair on the back of Bruce\u2019s neck like Bruce himself had done, and the other reaches out and gently as he can manage, presses the button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The button gives a soft pulse of vibration, then like a waterfall the rest of the haptics pulse out across Bruce\u2019s torso. Bruce shivers at the feeling, Clark is way too close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s lights on, pulsing through the suit a soft blue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor them to continue being active I need to put on the actual set within two minutes. The main battery pack is in the backpiece of the cape.\u201d Bruce\u2019 voice is quiet, it doesn\u2019t need to be loud when they\u2019re so close together. \u201cThey buzz when turning on and off to let me know if any of them are broken or in need of minor repairs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can hear the steady heartbeat, the heartbeat he can recognize and latch onto from anywhere on the globe if he wanted to listen for it, underneath a soft buzz of electronics. He can <em> feel </em> the soft pulse underneath his fingers that tangle up in Bruce\u2019s soft hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d Clark breathes, too close, way to close, holy shit is it hot in here?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce warms under his touch, just a little bit. \u201cIt was a personal project.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou managed to put yourself, as a regular simple human, through enough rigorous training that you got into a League of the strongest people in the entire world.\u201d Clark inches close, he hasn\u2019t removed either hand yet, \u201cI think that\u2019s really worth something a little more than just \u2018a personal product\u2019, B.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark laughs, finally gives in and leans as close as he\u2019s always wanted to lean. Presses his forehead right under the curve of Bruce\u2019s skull. It smells like <em> Batman </em> here, in a way that Clark has never allowed himself to explore before. Warmth, leather, the sharp spark of electronics, shampoo, hair gel, sweat, old expensive cologne, the kind of stuff made from real extract not just processed chemicals, and hormones underneath it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce leans back, humming softly deep in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I respect you more now than I did before.\u201d Clark tells him, into the back of Batman\u2019s neck, into his hair. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s hand twitches, it would be impossible not to notice the minute movement, just a hair before he actually shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking this so well.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark still isn\u2019t processing this correctly, still hasn\u2019t really accepted the fact he\u2019s been best friends with <em> Bruce Wayne </em> all these years. \u201cOh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sunk in yet.\u201d Clark informs B, aiming for humor. \u201cI must have the best luck <em> ever </em>, I have two billionaires who are obsessed with me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman- Bruce- <em> laughs </em>. Bright and deep without the muffling of all those electronics he normally has in that cowl of his. \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to Lex.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have much better hair.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark huffs, he uses every single bit of strength to pull himself away from Bruce\u2019s space. \u201cYou\u2019re <em> absolutely </em>right.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that he knows, Clark can tell that the wings aren\u2019t natural.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ticks of Batman\u2019s hands, the twitching, corresponds to some movements in his cape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a kind of stiffness that Clark never noticed before he has watched Bruce Wayne walk without it, the weight of responsibility, the weight of heavy armour on shoulders trained since birth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark keeps his secret, because Bruce asked him too, but it\u2019s something that he\u2019s in awe of still every time that B puts <em> trust </em> into Clark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time that Batman had asked Clark carefully to watch the door as he showered off the latest goo-themed monster, turning around and pulling up his short hair and tapping the zipper down the middle of his spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The way that sometimes, after a big battle, when it\u2019s just Clark in the room with him Batman will power down for a moment, clicking that power button and unhooking the claws from the hollow of his throat manually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0The way that when he gets injured now he\u2019ll allow Clark to get close to help treat him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark can\u2019t quite mesh \u2018<em> Bruce Wayne </em>\u2019 with his long term fascination, but he\u2019s getting there with every stolen moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce needs to get out a press statement about his new charity project- feeding kids across america by paying for their school meals- but his usual trusted press are wary of operating outside of the trusted realm of Gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne Enterprise is located all across the nation and in several other countries, it\u2019s just its home base is in Gotham. When Gotham runs out of safe locations to put places then of course Bruce expands outwards into other places, it\u2019s not like he <em> owns </em> the entire city. While he would love to put people in employment in his own city he\u2019s also helping Jason clean up Crime Alley with smaller, more local businesses and the easiest locations are snatched up from underneath his nose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he complains about this Jason and Tim simply high five one another and snicker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sets up the charity right across the bay without even really thinking about it, but now he\u2019s trying to find somebody that won\u2019t twist his words and bring up his boys and will just focus on the actual <em> news </em> instead of the gossip around his life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce leans back, there is <em> one </em> person who could help him here. It\u2019s sort of cheating, but it\u2019s not unprecedented.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kal had said he was working on something that had to pass Bruce\u2019s approval before he published it- but maybe Bruce could give him something easy to publish in the meantime?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches for his phone, sitting right beside the plate, and sends a message through an encrypted number.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cheating to ask a friend a favor like this, but it\u2019s the easiest way to do things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is getting laughed at by Louis again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman is <em> losing her mind </em> laughing, she\u2019s curled up on the couch, leaning into Jimmy and wiping away tears from her eyes. \u201cT-tell me again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark huffs, gently pressing his feet into her thighs to move her further into poor Jimmy\u2019s space. Jimmy\u2019s eating his too-thick milkshake and is half over the arm of the couch, while Clark\u2019s on the other side stretched out and telling his friends his woes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be mean about it!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis snorts another unattractive breath of laughter. \u201cOnly <em> you </em>, smallville, can have a life this wild.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not his most wild secret, that\u2019s definitely the fact he\u2019s an alien, but he lets Louis laugh at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really sweet that your D&amp;D friend finally revealed himself to you.\u201d Jimmy says, over Louis\u2019s head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis dungeons and dragons boyfriend, <em> who is also rich </em>.\u201d Louis is too happy about this. \u201cWho was so weird all this time because he was too rich and didn\u2019t want anybody else to feel uncomfortable about it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark blushes, bright ruddy over his ears, \u201cI did <em> not </em> phrase it like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sorta did.\u201d Jimmy says over Louis breathless wheezes. \u201cMore delicately, sure, but you pretty much said the reason he didn\u2019t want you to know his name was that he was a high society figure.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is about to snap back, tell his friends to lay off, when his phone rings on the coffee table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark sighs, he recognizes that particular ringtone, slightly different than his normal one. Somebody in the League is trying to get his opinion on something without using the emergency line. They\u2019ve all got dummy numbers tied to their personal phones so they can be contacted easily and without having to make some wacky excuse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis and Jimmy, unfortunately, are close enough that they can <em> tell </em> when Clark\u2019s got a particular ringtone he uses for his \u2018internet dungeons and dragons\u2019 friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis <em> lights up </em>, she reaches out to make a grab at Clark\u2019s phone- she\u2019s been drinking wine and she\u2019s a hell of a lot bolder four glasses in than she normally is- but Clark is much faster than either of his boozed up friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He glances at the unlisted number, focused on the last four digits- 0002, Batman -and picks up. \u201cHello?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell your friends we say hi!\u201d Jimmy calls, loud around his spoon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this your crush!?\u201d Louis screeches in happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark. Wants. To. Die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease ignore any words you might be hearing, These are my annoying coworkers whom I hate.\u201d Clark tells the silent line, both informing Batman that he\u2019s with people at the moment and his friends that they\u2019re being <em> assholes </em>. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell your annoying coworkers, whom you hate, I say hello back.\u201d Bruce\u2019s warm deep voice comes from the line. \u201cAnd I have a question about potentially being in civilian contact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark uses his foot to stop Louis from lunging over and stealing his phone right from his ear, she\u2019s way too excited about this. \u201cHe says hello back.\u201d He tells her and Jimmy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two of them fist bump, excited noises coming from their tispy brains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t hang out.\u201d Clark tells Bruce over the line, trying to be a little discrete about it. \u201cText me more information about it? I\u2019m kinda wrangling Louis and Jimmy right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a bitch session!\u201d Louis tries to talk as close to the phone as she can, but she\u2019s mostly still being deflected by Clark\u2019s legs. \u201cSmallville\u00a0 talks about how he wants you to <em> like-like </em> him-!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark hangs up, that is <em> enough </em> of that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The opening of a new charity isn\u2019t as fancy as some of the gala\u2019s are. Bruce is just dressed in a simple suit, no tuxedo in sight, with all <em> three </em> children in the main room and giving each other significant looks throughout the night. Tim\u2019s here \u2018on behalf\u2019 of Drake industries, a show of good faith between companies, while Dick and Jason are here to show \u2018the full force\u2019 of the Wayne Empire. They\u2019re the only four of any real status, everyone else is going to be working in the new charity, working with other charities and will help support this new one, or the press.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce smiles at another photographer, pausing for a moment to allow them to get a great shot of him at a beautiful venue in Metropolis overlooking the bay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Exhausting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce looks over the crowd again, these people are here to do good, to try their best, and help in the ways available to them. It\u2019s a much more exciting crowd than his normal parties hold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA moment, Mr. Wayne?\u201d A familiar voice says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce smirks, let\u2019s his head roll smooth and polished and seductive over to where the voice had come from. Sure enough, there\u2019s Clark Kent, fitting in much more nicely here than at their previous encounter. There\u2019s also, right by his side, a pretty woman whose smile is too sharp to be anybody but Louis Lane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is a little offended that Clark brought his co-worker, but Clark had also said that he might have to bring the woman along to something like this because she had smelt blood in the water and had gone through Clark\u2019s computer to find the files he was working on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bruce lets himself be petty, just a little bit. \u201cSure!\u201d Dazzlingly bright, with way too much emphasis on the end of the word. Bruce lets his eyes trali obviously over Clark\u2019s form, and his smirk grows wider. \u201cI\u2019ll give <em> you </em> a few moments, if you want them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark doesn\u2019t look impressed, but Louis seems unsure on how to move forward. Bruce puts on an aggressively blank face, domicile but with nothing behind the eyes that could indicate higher thought, he\u2019s put off more than one interview with this expression, more than one conversation by looking like he\u2019s never had a spark of thought at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark nods his head to a more private area, the balcony of the venue, overlooking the bay, Bruce smiles wide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The three of them disentangle from the crowd, Clark using his bulk to carve a path that Louis and Bruce follow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The balcony is beautiful, and empty. Just turning into fall there\u2019s a chill in the air that most people don't want to tolerate for more than a few minutes to get pictures of the bay and head back inside. The bay that separates Jersey and Delaware is expansive, you can see the lights of Gotham from here but make out none of the buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou picked somewhere pretty cold!\u201d Brucie tells them, slipping into the most annoying part of his persona he can, just to watch Clark\u2019s entire <em> body </em> wince. Hilarious. \u201cI thought this was headed somewhere <em> much </em> more fun than this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark rolls his eyes, \u201cI was here last time your children managed to sabotage the party, I still haven\u2019t gotten the champagne out of that shirt, so I decided not to risk an attack from above.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis jerks her head, from looking at Bruce Wayne to Clark. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce can\u2019t let his smile sharpen, no matter how much he wants to, \u201cLast time I was here there was only <em> Jason </em>here, Dick was in New York studying for something or other. He\u2019s doing great in his classes, studying to be one of those cop scientists.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis looked actually pained to be talking to this man. Clark looks like he\u2019s trying not to laugh. \u201cLouis, can you give us a minute?\u201d Clark asks her, all small town country smiles and dimples.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Louis agrees, \u201cI\u2019m just going to talk to a few people, the Drake boy, see you later.\u201d\u2019 With that she squeezes Clark\u2019s first two fingers and darts away from what had been shaping up to be a rather horrific conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When she goes back inside both men relax, just a little bit, and turn to each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever seen you do.\u201d Clark says, mildly horrified.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce huffs a laugh of air. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly helpful in my daily life.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to act like you aren\u2019t one of the smartest men alive on a daily basis?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sets expectations on my interactions at an all time low.\u201d Bruce has explained this three times, it\u2019s not hard to do it a fourth. \u201cI can say anything, do anything and nobody bats an eye. The stories the press run are ten minutes, at most, with no real quotes from me. My words don\u2019t <em> matter </em> when I\u2019m out here, like this. It\u2019s rather enjoyable.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An exhale, deep and rattling. Clark understands, he\u2019s one of the few people who probably does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked the Daily Planet to come here because you\u2019re a known person that I can say anything to and not have to worry about how my words will affect my company, my image, and my boys. You\u2019re not going to make my life harder without a damn good reason.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh now I feel bad.\u201d Clark\u2019s tone is full of humor, but there\u2019s an edge in his tone that\u2019s hard underneath it all. \u201cBecause I was writing up a draft that had the potential to make your life complicated, but I was going to delete it before Louis went through my C-drive and got into a holy rage-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like nothing.\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice is half hum; it's so low and breathless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark hesitates, \u201cI \u2026 might have written up a story about Robin getting abandoned by his parents for months at a time and how the upper crust of Gotham wasn\u2019t as beautiful as it appeared.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Well </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That could cause complications for him, but nobody can say that he isn\u2019t a huge part of his children\u2019s lives, and in fact-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPublish it.\u201d Bruce tells Clark. \u201cTim loves his parents, they don\u2019t hurt him, but having him put into my care- even just temporarily when his parents are gone- will ease everybodies worries right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s going to raise all holy hell, the teenager really did love his parents from the bottom of his heart, he wasn\u2019t left alone anymore when they were gone because he came to Bruce\u2019s house all the time. He technically had a room at the manor but would always run back over to his own home to sleep, arriving back in the morning to go to school with Jason or to go into the cave for training on the weekends. The story\u2019s going to be slammed down immediately, the Drake\u2019s have enough money and power to squash any allegations of neglect into the dust, but Bruce could absolutely casually mention to the Drakes that\u00a0 he\u2019s willing to look after their kid when the two of them are gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark raises an eyebrow, a look Batman has seen on Superman more than once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your story, both of them. Publish it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark publishes the story, Louis Lane as a co-writer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They win two awards for it, very prestigious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It gets buried artificially three days after it\u2019s published, sucked down the black hole that\u2019s the media powerhouse of the rich and famous. Nobody talks about it within the week- an abandoned child of Gotham, raised in riches, still managing to not get a single shred of sympathy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark considers writing another piece, about how Gotham City expects its children- all of them, rich to poor to black to white and every single thing in between- to grow up without a figure to guide them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Louis just tells him that Gotham would respond how it always does, they would look to the sky for that damnable Bat-Signal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another robotic uprising, courtesy of some crazed lunatic in eastern Europe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire League was called in, everybody all hands on board to help take down thousands of buzzing swarms of battle bots armed to the teeth with deadly weapons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce goes down, one of those robots take a suicide nosedive into Batman\u2019s wings and explodes into fiery-hot heat right at the base of the cape\u2019s wings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce says nothing but a soft grunt of pain, but Clark\u2019s entire mind <em> blanks </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spiraling down, Bruce grasps at the sky, his grapple had snapped earlier in the fight, his backup grapple had gotten damaged in the first fall. There\u2019s nothing below him but jagged rocky debris, hundreds of robots ready to tear him to shreds if he\u2019s too injured to keep going.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce falls probably fifty, sixty feet, not reaching anywhere close to terminal velocity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ground would still break his back if he hit it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Strong arms, a chest, curl themselves around Bruce\u2019s back, the feel of alien silk on the back of his legs. Superman can\u2019t just <em> stop </em> a fall, he has to slow down before stopping or reversing momentum so he doesn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce allows himself to fall into Clark\u2019s chest, rest his head into the curve of Clark\u2019s neck, hear the whisper of Superman fervently repeating over and over, \u201cI got you, I have you, I got you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman slows them down, Bruce\u2019s entire right side is full of popping shocks telling him that his right wing is out of commission, not able to be used.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t land, but Superman twirls them in such a way that he\u2019s holding onto Batman\u2019s thighs, one on either side of his waist, chest to chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Bruce rumbles out, \u201cWould have been a pancake without you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Superman leans close, nosing into Bruce\u2019s jawline and smelling that spike in adrenaline. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t <em> scare </em> me like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce slips a hand into his utility belt, grabbing one of his last EMP\u2019s. He tosses it over Superman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that for next time.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The watchtower technically has rooms for anybody to use, but they\u2019re mostly bunk rooms for large numbers to rest before the next round of whatever they were dealing with happened to attack them. There\u2019s only two rooms that have one bed in them- isolation rooms for dealing with potential infectious diseases or some kind of mind control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman had to tell everybody that he was <em> fine </em> , don\u2019t worry about his wings, he\u2019s <em> not </em> going to the medical ward. There\u2019s a huge meeting of everybody who had jumped at the call to battle, a debriefing that took several hours over multiple people delegating multiple teams. They had multiple injuries, with a few very serious ones, and one casualty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman grabbed Superman after everything had been dealt with, after hours of dealing with their own team, the government, the UN, and the public, and told everyone plainly under pain of <em> grievous injury </em>that if they had a question to talk to Diana about it- he was going to make Superman fly him home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark had followed after Batman, easy as he ever does, and only pipes up for a second after they pass the Zeta room. \u201cHey- aren\u2019t we- we just passed-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark shuts right up when his mental maps tell him <em> exactly </em> where they\u2019re going, a huge smile on his face and his steps speeding up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The iso-wards are soundproof, have various protocols in place, and can be locked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only one woman in the whole Tower who can override Batman\u2019s own codes, and she\u2019s not going to open the locked door without the entire world being on fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door to the iso-ward gets closed, locked, and the soundproofing goes up, the windows get blocked, and the temperature grows comfortable with a simple command Bruce barks as soon as he walks in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark is <em> on </em> him within nanoseconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me out of this suit.\u201d Bruce says into Clarks mouth, red lips brushing against one another as they talk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark does as he is told.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce really does look horrible, soot on his face and trailing his jawline, his right wing limp and the armour torn off, clearly broken in multiple places. There\u2019s chunks of Bruce\u2019s main armour that have also taken heavy blows, Bruce rips off his cowl and Clark is just taken <em> back </em> by the sheer beauty that hides under there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s own suit is easy to take off, pressing against his crest, but Batman\u2019s takes time to peel away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rough fabric makes Clark\u2019s skin shiver in excitement where they brush against one another, kissing as Bruce starts unbuckling, unzipping, and ripping himself out of the outer shell. His cape is a little tricker, Clark marvels at being able to peel away the system that anchors the thin leather wing membrane to Bruce\u2019s sides, down his back, all the way to his knees. It\u2019s like unwrapping a christmas present, like peeling a person out of lingerie, like getting your fingernails underneath a stubborn sticker and <em> pulling </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is full of scars, beautifully stark and pink across his weaponized body, but he\u2019s still able to flush so pink in <em> just </em> the right places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t put themselves into words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce hates words, how limiting they are, how they\u2019re never exactly right for what he wants them to be, how words can be used like double-triple-infinitely bladed weapons coming from directions he can\u2019t block.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clark finds he can wax on about what they are, what they can be, what they can be called, for pages and pages and pages. Clark\u2019s whole job is words and how they\u2019re strung together to make something more than themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have fights, they have makeups, they have sex. They kiss one another when they need reassurances that they\u2019re both alive, when they become overcome with emotion, when they get irritated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce doesn\u2019t want the media to find out about them, Clark doesn\u2019t want that either. They like being able to live relatively in peace, without the constant barrage of the press. Bruce likes having his kids where they are and not having to fight off more comments about him taking them in than he already does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd87\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you see that?\u201d Robin asks, pointing out over the rooftops of Gotham.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman squints in that direction, trying to see what Robin had caught onto.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s somebody pretty small on a rooftop, curled around what appears to be a bag and leaning up against an air conditioning unit. There\u2019s no rooftop access there, so the kid must have climbed the fire escape or something to get there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRunaway?\u201d Robin asks, \u201cThey look pretty haggard.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That they do, curled up tight and tired in the almost winter air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou continue on, catch up to where Hood is going to meet us at the docks. I\u2019m going to go check it out.\u201d Batman tells Robin, already moving to make the leap between buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin just gives a cheeky salute and takes off in the exact opposite direction, a whirl of grappling line to get some real height under him and the flurry of feathers beating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman moves silently, the distance between him and the child closes rapidly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a boy, maybe about seven or eight, with dark skin and darker hair. He\u2019s holding onto a single half full duffle bag with a tight grip, wearing-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>League of Assasin garments, Batman can see three hidden blades and five not-so hidden ones at first glance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not a runaway then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman lets his shadow be seen, flaring his wings wide and waiting for the child to actually drag his gaze over before moving forward again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not here to fight, clearly, from the posture and the way the clothing looks worn and stained, the dirt around the child\u2019s fingernails. He\u2019s <em> tired </em>, bone weary, exhausted and looking at Batman like a death sentence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman settles on the roof, wraps his wings around himself and waits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child is expecting him, clearly, it\u2019s why he\u2019s up here and oh-so visible. Who knows how <em> long </em> the kid has been hanging out on the rooftops of Gotham waiting to be noticed, Batman doesn\u2019t often patrol the same route. When Bruce lands, then doesn\u2019t move forward or speak, the child uncurls himself, stands as straight as what has probably been beaten into him to do, and begins to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother is Talia al Ghul.\u201d He starts with, and Bruce can see how strong the resemblance between the two are. They have the same grass green eyes, the same elegant nose, the same high cheekbones, the same curl to their upper lip, but the shape of the face, the shape of the eyes.... \u201cEight years ago she had the league collect the DNA of the Batman-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The shape of this child\u2019s eyes is his <em> own </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe made <em> me </em>.\u201d The child\u2019s got narrow shoulders but he throws them back away in an attempt to seem bigger than he is. \u201cThe grandson of Ra\u2019s al Ghul, the demon head of the League of Assassins and former heir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The words are spit out, Batman and Ra\u2019s have gone head to head before, Batman had thought that Ra\u2019s held some kind of respect for him but <em> apparently </em> not. This was a huge violation, but there\u2019s nothing that Bruce can do about it <em> now </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wanted me to be like <em> you </em>.\u201d The child continues, his shoulders start creeping up, defensively, Bruce is never going to hit him but he\u2019s seen how the League treats it\u2019s members. \u201cBut I was a f-failure-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce is moving before he consciously is aware of it. Faster than you can blink Bruce is scooping up the small child in front of him- <em> his own flesh and blood </em> what the hell- and pressing him into a bone deep hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child hisses, immediately begins to fail and curse and claw his little sharp nails along Bruce\u2019s armour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The League didn\u2019t know he was Bruce Wayne, Ra\u2019s had complimented him multiple times on his ability to fight, to move, to operate \u2018as a meta\u2019. If this boy was bred and born to be like him then the League must have been\u00a0 expecting a child to look like <em> Batman. </em>All winged fury and black shadows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Winged </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A factual point that this child is very much <em> not </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The League of Assassins had\u00a0 wanted a <em> bat, </em>not a boy, to raise and do horrible things with, to train up just like Batman himself and send in to kill people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Bruce has to ask, putting the child back down before the boy can reach for the knives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As much as the kid had put up a fuss, when Bruce peels away the boy unconsciously seems to follow his fathers embrace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He quickly seems to catch himself, however, because he resquares his shoulders and says with all the confidence in the world- \u201cMy name is Damian al Ghul, I am an experimental failure to recreate the Batman, and I was sent away before my grandfather killed me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
