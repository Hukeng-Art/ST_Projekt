  "text": "<p>Life, Jimin thinks, is a bitch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One moment you\u2019re a young, confident gay, and the next you\u2019re spilling the contents of your beer all over yourself because you\u2019ve walked right into the couch while gawking at your best friend\u2019s younger brother. You know, the one you thought was really cute but in the he\u2019s-like-a-younger-brother-to-me-too way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is tragic even for you,\u201d Taehyung says, staring at Jimin but offering no help. Not that Jimin would know how to take it. His brain\u2019s short-circuiting at the sight of Jungkook. A minute ago, he was a functioning member of society, and now he\u2019s potentially forgotten his own name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung follows his line of vision and gives a low whistle. \u201cYou\u2019re staring like you\u2019ve never seen abs before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a fucking <em>sixteen</em> pack or something! What fucking alternate timeline are we <em>in</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s shirt is soaked through with beer, but he can\u2019t muster up the attention span to care. He\u2019s just gaping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s...nothing like what Jimin remembers. He\u2019d only seen him last summer, when everyone had come home and they\u2019d hung out in usual summer custom. Jimin remembers him as kind of gangly, a kid still trying to fill out of his body, and <em>boy</em> has he filled it out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has <em>tattoos</em> now. And possibly the hottest body Jimin has ever seen in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need me to get you a bib and wipe your drool? This is really not your best look.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, shut up,\u201d Jimin snaps, glaring at Taehyung. He\u2019s thankful he\u2019s not staring at Jungkook anymore, but his eyes kind of just drift right back. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Jungkook had surpassed Jimin height-wise in high school but somehow, with all the added muscle, he looks even taller. He almost can\u2019t believe his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can make out every line of Jungkook\u2019s abs, his shoulders broader than Jimin remembers. He\u2019s thicker everywhere; the fleeting thought of being crushed between his thighs passes through Jimin\u2019s mind before being replaced by the sheer size of Jungkook\u2019s biceps. His right forearm is covered in ink, and despite Jimin\u2019s contacts, he can\u2019t quite make out what the tattoo is. He\u2019s even got little black gauges and a gold nose piercing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth has gone dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like Jimin hasn\u2019t seen a big, buff guy before. He goes to the gym, he\u2019s seen plenty, and some of them are even bigger than Jungkook. But for some reason, he can\u2019t wrap his head around Jungkook\u2019s sudden transformation. There\u2019s almost this disconnect, like Jungkook wasn\u2019t supposed to get all big and buff and look so grown up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done creaming your pants, Joonie-hyung is headed over so maybe, I dunno, stop checking out his little brother,\u201d Taehyung informs him, his mildly amused look transforming into a full-on smile as Namjoon approaches them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin scowls at Taehyung but it\u2019s easily ignored, and he turns his attention to Namjoon, who\u2019s finally wandered down from his room. He quirks an eyebrow at the mess on Jimin\u2019s shirt, reaching to hug Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys made it!\u201d Namjoon grins, arm draping over Taehyung\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be saying that to you? Why\u2019ve you been holed up in your room?\u201d Jimin asks, giving Namjoon a quick side hug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMum called,\u201d Namjoon explains, glancing across his living room. He waves Jungkook over. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about this party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Taehyung laughs, giving Jimin a look that he\u2019s too late interpreting because before Jimin knows it, Jeon Jungkook is standing next to him, a happy grin on his too-handsome face. Jimin can feel the heat in his cheeks as he tries not to stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Jungkook smiles, brows raising in concern as he takes in Jimin\u2019s soaked shirt. Great. Now Jungkook would remember him as the loser with beer spilled all over himself. \u201cYou okay, Jiminie-hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Taehyung answers in Jimin\u2019s stead, waving a hand dismissively over at him. Jimin narrows his eyes at his best friend, a little mortified as he realises that his shirt is starting to cling to his abdomen. \u201cBut, wow, look at you, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie\u2019s a muscle pig now,\u201d Namjoon laughs, reaching out to ruffle Jungkook\u2019s carefully tousled hair. Jungkook scowls at his brother, slapping his hand away and ends up standing even closer to Jimin. This close, Jimin can see the sheen of sweat beginning to build up against Jungkook\u2019s skin from the heat. His eyes try to find somewhere to look except he can\u2019t because <em>holy shit</em>, Jungkook has his nipples pierced.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin almost groans out loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, come on,\u201d Jungkook whines, attempting to fix whatever he thinks Namjoon has ruined.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Namjoon says with a roll of his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too cool for me now, huh? Just because you can bench press \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t complaining when I was lugging the Library of Alexandria from your room down to the basement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon has the decency to fluster a little at Jungkook\u2019s quip. \u201cWhere did the Jungkook who followed me around everywhere go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to old age, hyung,\u201d Jimin grins, reminded of his own little brother at Jungkook\u2019s sass. \u201cWe\u2019re not cool enough for our brothers now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Taehyung sighs, a hand to his chest. He wipes some imaginary tears from his eyes, and Jungkook only scowls at that, rolling his eyes at their antics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only two years younger than you,\u201d he retorts, but it lands on deaf ears, Namjoon laughing as he reaches forward to pinch Jungkook\u2019s cheek. His hand gets swatted away before it makes contact, Jungkook\u2019s eyes narrowed in defense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, stop picking on him,\u201d Jimin says, coming to Jungkook\u2019s defense despite the way his breath lodges in his throat when Jungkook smiles at him directly. He looks away immediately, pulling at his shirt so it stops sticking to his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLemme go get you a new shirt?\u201d Namjoon offers, pointing at Jimin\u2019s situation, but before he can make it one step away, Jungkook\u2019s butting in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get it!\u201d he interrupts, already bounding off toward the stairs. Jimin\u2019s eyes widen at the tiger tattoo he sees etched along Jungkook\u2019s back, the vibrant colours bringing the tiger to life. He\u2019d managed to make out the black and white snake wrapped around Jungkook\u2019s forearm when he\u2019d come over, pretty flowers hiding its winding body amongst them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud yell from one of the other rooms and Namjoon\u2019s head whips in the direction like an antelope's before he\u2019s excusing himself to go see what the commotion is about. Jimin very purposefully ignores the smirk Taehyung gives him, eyebrows waggling suggestively.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he drawls, leaning in closer to Jimin. \u201cGot yourself a little crush there, huh, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Jimin mutters, shoving Taehyung roughly as he heads over to the stairs, Taehyung\u2019s laughter following him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin hardly makes it two steps up the stairs before Jungkook\u2019s bounding down, a white t-shirt in hand. He\u2019s still decidedly shirtless himself, and Jimin has to avert his attention to the beige paint along the staircase wall so he doesn\u2019t hone in on Jungkook\u2019s nipple piercings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hyung,\u201d Jungkook starts, pausing where he\u2019s standing. \u201cI was gonna come get you. Thought maybe you\u2019d wanna change upstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows and offers Jungkook the best smile he can muster. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s smile tinges pink at the nickname, but he\u2019s turning back toward his room. Jimin follows him up the stairs, all the doors closed to ward off any wayward partygoers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls at his shirt again, grimacing at the stickiness. He\u2019d have to wash off the beer before changing into the t-shirt. Jungkook leads him to his room, the music downstairs slowly fading with each step forward. For some reason, Jimin feels like his heart is going to burst out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been to Jungkook\u2019s room a handful of times, but growing up Jungkook had been shy and a little broody, wanting to be left alone when he disappeared into his room. Jimin remembers the room being fairly neat; he was always a little embarrassed that someone two years younger than him had a cleaner room than his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pauses in the middle of his room. Jimin\u2019s eyes are fixed to the tattoo on his back, his head whipping in the other direction when Jungkook turns to look at him. He stares very hard at the TV Jungkook\u2019s set up in the corner of his room, PS4 and XBox hooked up to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can give me the, uh, dirty shirt, hyung. I\u2019ll run it through the wash for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen, and he shakes his head. \u201cOh my god, no, it\u2019s okay Jungkook! You don\u2019t \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jungkook interrupts, smiling. He holds the t-shirt out to him, and Jimin doesn\u2019t miss the onceover he gives him, smile turning a little smug. \u201cYou should be more careful, hyung. Isn\u2019t this your favourite shirt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just beer,\u201d Jimin grumbles, snatching the t-shirt out of Jungkook\u2019s hand. Jimin huffs as he turns down the hallway, heading to the bathroom. His cheeks burn, a little shocked that Jungkook knew he was wearing his favorite shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spends a good five minutes in the bathroom wiping beer off of himself, his soiled shirt laid down on the counter. Jungkook\u2019s t-shirt is too big on him, and it makes something squirm in his gut, unable to look himself in the eye. He hurries out of the bathroom, door swinging open, and nearly yelps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jimin hisses, hand clutching his chest. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d He\u2019d expected Jungkook to have wandered back down but instead finds him loitering outside of the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs, reaching for the shirt in Jimin\u2019s hand. He smiles, doe eyes sharpening into something that makes Jimin\u2019s mouth run dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook \u2014 \u201d Jimin starts, trying to take the shirt back, but it\u2019s pointless. Jungkook\u2019s already walking toward the stairs with it in hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCute,\u201d Jungkook says, looking back over his shoulder at Jimin, eyes scanning Jimin up and down. Then he disappears down the stairs, and a horribly satisfying heat blooms in Jimin\u2019s cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of the countless ways to start the morning, falling on his ass because Kim Taehyung\u2019s a bed hog has to be Jimin\u2019s least favorite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up with a groan and a thump, bringing half the blanket with him. Taehyung mumbles sleepily and snatches the blanket back, sending Jimin rolling onto his front. He lies there for a long moment, contemplating his existence, before he finally pushes himself to his feet. Yawning, Jimin stretches until his back cracks and rubs his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could probably get to the kitchen with his eyes closed, he\u2019s been here so many times, and that\u2019s pretty much what he does. In between yawns and scratching his tummy, he stumbles toward the kitchen with his eyes drooping. He could have slept at least another two hours if it weren\u2019t for his useless best friend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so out of focus that he doesn\u2019t realise the kitchen isn\u2019t empty until he walks right into something very solid and very warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin squeaks, eyes flying open as he stumbles back. There are arms around his waist before he can fall \u2014 big, strong arms \u2014 and a quiet laugh to accompany them. It\u2019s Jungkook in all his bare-chested, tatted glory, and Jimin\u2019s heart goes <em>boom, boom</em> then stutters to a complete stop. As if he hadn\u2019t admired him enough the day before, Jimin finds himself admiring him again, the V of his hips and strong planes of his chest and his <em>biceps</em> \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm \u2014 \u201d Jimin starts, blushing all the way to his ears. He can\u2019t form a coherent answer and it\u2019s all Jungkook\u2019s fault. Catching someone is usually followed by letting them go afterward, but here Jungkook is, his arms still wrapped firmly around Jimin\u2019s waist. There isn\u2019t a lot of space between them; Jimin can feel the heat of his body acutely. \u201cI, uh \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone else still asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not trusting himself to speak, Jimin nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looking for breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin wonders if he keeps asking questions precisely because Jimin seems to be incapable of answering them. Jungkook stares down at him, waiting, his eyes sparkling with amusement. So he thinks this is <em>funny</em>. Jimin huffs, suddenly annoyed. \u201cJust wanted some water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook finally lets him go, and Jimin can breathe again. He pulls two glasses from a cabinet, and Jimin admires the way the muscles of his back shift when he reaches up, admires his tiger tattoo that moves with him. Jungkook fills the glasses with water from the fridge and opens the door, squinting inside. The gold of his nose piercing glints in the light, and Jimin finds himself admiring it, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want breakfast? We\u2019ve got some stuff in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs and hands him his water. Their fingers brush when Jimin takes it. He leans against the counter opposite Jimin and sips on his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna put on a shirt?\u201d Jimin blurts, then mentally smacks himself on the head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A grin spreads across Jungkook\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s kinda cold, aren\u2019t you cold \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really that cold. Anyway, if I\u2019m cold, you probably are too.\u201d He glances pointedly down at Jimin\u2019s tiny sleep shorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin crosses his legs self-consciously. \u201cNot cold,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how have you been?\u201d Jungkook asks, peering at him with genuine curiosity. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked in a while. How\u2019s school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStressful,\u201d Jimin sighs. \u201cToo much work. But I guess it\u2019ll be worth it eventually. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, same old. Things are the same as always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin eyes him up and down. \u201cNot really the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all the same.\u201d Jungkook smiles and shrugs in acknowledgement. \u201cI missed you, Jiminie-hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin finds himself blushing at the admission, at how easily it\u2019s given. He\u2019d always been closer to Namjoon growing up, but he\u2019d doted on Jungkook, loved how cute and shy he always was and how he tried to hide it behind aloofness. Jungkook was a good kid. <em>Is</em> a good kid, though Jimin isn\u2019t sure how to fit this new Jungkook in with the one he\u2019s always known.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem to be worried about an answer. He moves and suddenly he\u2019s coming right toward Jimin, eyes fixed on him and Jimin freezes, his stomach doing flip-flops that make him woozy \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans past him to grab something. His chest brushes Jimin\u2019s, and Jimin gets an eyeful of the tendons in his neck and his smooth collarbones. He swallows harshly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d comes Taehyung\u2019s sleepy voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls away. He\u2019s holding a napkin, and Jimin bristles. He\u2019s only drinking water, he didn\u2019t need to do all that for a damn napkin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018M hungry,\u201d Taehyung slurs. \u201cCan you guys stop flirting and get me some breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFlirting,\u201d Jimin splutters, but Jungkook just rolls his eyes. \u201cWe weren\u2019t \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Taehyung waves him off, clearly unconcerned. He runs a hand through his bedhead and only proceeds to mess it up further. \u201cBreakfast, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet it yourself,\u201d Jungkook grumbles. \u201cLike you don\u2019t always raid the fridge anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYah, you brat,\u201d Taehyung complains, but he still moves for the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep,\u201d Jimin huffs, marching out of the kitchen. He\u2019s still flustered. \u201cTaehyung, you\u2019re not allowed in the bed anymore!\u201d he calls over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry and stop me!\u201d Taehyung shouts back, and Jimin hears Jungkook laugh before he turns the corner into the hallway and drowns them out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re being too loud,\u201d Jimin giggles into his coffee, glancing away from the girl sitting two tables down with her textbook out. She\u2019d been staring at them a second ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who looks is just jealous that we\u2019re having so much fun,\u201d Taehyung says sagely. He takes a haughty sip of his coffee for emphasis. It\u2019s barely even coffee, just some milky concoction with too much syrup because Taehyung has picky taste buds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Namjoon wheedles, \u201cCan I have a bite of your cake? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs and pushes his plate across the table, Namjoon\u2019s dimples making an instant appearance. \u201cI told you to get a slice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he mumbles through a bite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said you\u2019d want some, what did I say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said I\u2019d want one,\u201d he acknowledges, chastised. Then he takes another bite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody ever listens to me,\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Mom, we get it,\u201d Taehyung grins. He nudges him, smile turning wicked. \u201cOr should I say, <em>Mommy</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYah!\u201d Jimin shrieks, elbowing him in the ribs. Taehyung chokes on his coffee, spluttering, and Namjoon bursts into laughter. The girl two tables down glares at them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon sobers. \u201cMaybe we should go back to my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His place. Namjoon\u2019s place which Jimin has frequented a multitude of times since he was a kid. Namjoon\u2019s place which also happens to contain a now very grown-up Jungkook. Jimin blushes bright red on instinct, burying his face in his coffee mug in the vain hope that no one will notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good idea,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cOnly if we get to binge anime on your big ass TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <em>not</em> watching anime,\u201d Namjoon groans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Taehyung sniffs. \u201cI\u2019ll just make Jungkook watch with me. Is he home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe should be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin makes some kind of unintentional noise into his mug that has them both looking over at him. He peeks at them over the rim. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like moving. Let\u2019s stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon tilts his head and Taehyung narrows his eyes. \u201cI dunno, we\u2019re being kind of annoying,\u201d Namjoon says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because Taehyung can\u2019t stop kinkshaming me in public \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not shaming you, I\u2019m just <em>saying</em> \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my place?\u201d Namjoon says, lips twisting in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your place,\u201d Jimin assures quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung stares at him for half a minute before a metaphorical light bulb goes off over his head. Then a sly grin spreads across his face. \u201cOh, I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Jimin hisses, turning a murderous glare on Taehyung that he\u2019s impervious to. He just keeps on grinning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet what?\u201d Namjoon says, glancing between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin doesn\u2019t want to go to your place \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Taehyung, you better shut your damn mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 because he\u2019s got a big, fat crush on Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon blinks, then his eyes widen in understanding, mouth shaping an <em>oh</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not have a fucking crush on Jungkook,\u201d Jimin seethes, wrapping an arm around Taehyung\u2019s neck and yanking him in to destroy his neatly-set hairstyle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t seem to mind, giggling as he squirms in his chokehold. \u201cYou wanna suck his soul out through his dick, admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s face melts into disgust. \u201cHey, that\u2019s my little brother you\u2019re talking about. Can it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin shoves Taehyung away and slouches in his seat, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cYeah, Taehyung, can it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s sharp attention turns immediately to Jimin. \u201cYou really have a crush on him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin looks away, lips twisting. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he mumbles honestly, and he really doesn\u2019t know what to do with the way his heart goes wild every time he so much as thinks about Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chin in hand, Namjoon hums in interest. There\u2019s something calculating about the look in Namjoon\u2019s eyes that Jimin doesn\u2019t like. \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he finally says. \u201cHe\u2019s always been your favourite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Taehyung complains. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be his favourite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we all want to be Jiminie\u2019s favourite, but it\u2019s pretty clear that spot belongs to Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin grumbles, even if he knows that\u2019s a little bit true. \u201cCan we move on from this topic of conversation now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon reaches across the table to pet Jimin\u2019s hair a little patronizingly. \u201cPoor Jiminie,\u201d he coos. \u201cSo we\u2019re going back to my place then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin drops his head onto the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s staring down at his scruffed-up sneakers when the door swings open. He smiles, glancing up, expecting to see Namjoon. Instead, he\u2019s met with a decidedly bare chest and two big, doe eyes, the corners crinkling up as Jimin\u2019s smile is returned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ssi,\u201d Jungkook greets, leaning against the door jam, biceps flexing as he crosses his arms over his chest. Jimin\u2019s brain goes offline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he offers intelligently, blinking several times. His brain seems to take its time getting back online. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs, the sound bright and happy, and it makes something hot twist in Jimin\u2019s belly, heat rising to his cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes, head ducking as he gathers his wits. \u201cUh, I \u2014 Namjoon-hyung\u2019s not home? We were supposed to hang out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shakes his head, straightening up, arms falling back down to his sides. Jimin does his best not to stare at his perfectly sculpted pecs or the metal bars pierced through his nipples. \u201cHyung left a little while ago with Tae-hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jimin deflates, shoulders drooping, head ducking. He hadn\u2019t even been late, having left his house with plenty of time to make it over to Namjoon\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna come inside, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s voice has an edge of concern laced through it as he shuffles a little closer. It forces Jimin to look back up and he\u2019s about to take a step back, not wanting to bother Jungkook \u2014 especially not with all his confusing feelings already in the array \u2014 when Jungkook\u2019s hand wraps around his wrist. His skin is warm and smooth, hand larger than Jimin\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on hyung, we haven\u2019t hung out in a while,\u201d Jungkook smiles, already pulling Jimin into the house. Jimin lets himself be tugged inside, slipping his shoes off with Jungkook\u2019s hand still wrapped around his wrist. It\u2019s like Jungkook thinks he\u2019s going to run off. And maybe he\u2019s not wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart is beating so fast he thinks it\u2019s going to burst out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-are you sure?\u201d Jimin finally asks, biting on his bottom lip, but Jungkook\u2019s guiding him toward the living room, a smile spread over his features. He\u2019s handsome in a way Jimin\u2019s always known him to be \u2014 doe eyes, prominent nose, sharp jaw \u2014 but he\u2019s grown into his features, has a maturity to his face he didn\u2019t have even a year ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows, tries his best not to think about how Jungkook still hasn\u2019t let him go. <em>You really have a crush on him?</em> Namjoon\u2019s words echo through his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Did he? Was that what this was? Somehow it felt wrong in as much as it felt right, Jimin\u2019s belly flip-flopping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was gonna marathon <em>FMA</em>, you in?\u201d Jungkook asks, looking over his shoulder. He\u2019s got a little setup in front of the TV, junk food of every variety waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe original or <em>Brotherhood</em>?\u201d Jimin asks as he settles down onto the couch next to Jungkook, careful to leave space between them. He\u2019s finally let go of Jimin\u2019s wrist and Jimin ignores the pang of loss, the way his skin feels emptied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe original. I haven\u2019t rewatched it since high school,\u201d Jungkook says, grabbing his laptop to start playing the anime.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know you\u2019re still a weeb,\u201d Jimin grins cheekily, laughing when Jungkook only rolls his eyes at him, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jimin whines, reaching out to smack at Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. He flushes a second later, avoiding the way Jungkook\u2019s grin grows bigger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s phone vibrates in his pocket and he digs it out, a text from Taehyung lighting up the screen: <em>enjoy ur date</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes widen and he immediately turns the screen off, shooting a quick glance at Jungkook but he\u2019s busy stuffing his face with shrimp crackers, the intro to <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> playing on the big screen TV.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hand grips his phone a little tighter, a sudden burst of annoyance rushing through him. So they\u2019d left on purpose? Those assholes!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sneaks a look over at Jungkook, cheeks heating and how is he supposed to focus on anything when Jungkook\u2019s just sitting there, <em>shirtless</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have some kinda vendetta against clothes?\u201d Jimin asks eventually, tired of trying to fight his own blush. What was so flustering about seeing Jungkook shirtless anyways? He huffs to himself, dutifully ignoring Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Jungkook counters, shoulders shrugging, but he\u2019s smirking knowingly. Jimin rolls his eyes, arms crossing over this chest. Somehow they\u2019ve ended up sitting closer on the couch, Jungkook slouching low in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For as long as Jimin can remember, he\u2019s known Namjoon and Jungkook. He\u2019s lucky, having the kind of friendships he has. There\u2019s a comfort in familiarity that you can\u2019t find in anything else. And perhaps that\u2019s what this is. That Jungkook\u2019s transformation was somehow jarring to everything Jimin has always known about Jungkook. He\u2019s always spoiled Jungkook, always coddled and annoyed him because that was really the only way to show Jungkook his love, his affection. Jungkook\u2019s shyness had always been endearing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Jungkook grow up, but then Jungkook\u2019s seen him grow up, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t know what to with that realisation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, the remote \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s about to reach for it and hand it to Jungkook but he never gets the chance, heart lodging in his throat as Jungkook leans over him, the heat from his skin sinking into Jimin. They\u2019re so close, Jungkook\u2019s weight settles against Jimin\u2019s chest. He grabs the remote teetering on the edge of the armrest by Jimin, grinning as he pulls back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin sucks in a shuddering breath, eyes narrowing. That was <em>definitely</em> not necessary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how to recover, wondering what it was about Jungkook that left him so completely unravelled. Normally, Jimin was the one leaving guys tongue-tied and flustered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin tugs on the bottoms of his shorts, the material having risen up to expose most of his thigh. He doesn\u2019t miss the way Jungkook glances over at him, heat sinking into his belly as his chest tightens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid \u2014 did Joonie-hyung say when they were gonna head back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs a shoulder, \u201cNever asked.\u201d His voice sounds a little tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure,\u201d Jimin starts, licking his lips. \u201cAre you sure you wanna hang out with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not even sure why he\u2019s asking since Jungkook had been the one to pull Jimin inside but Jimin\u2019s good at panicking over things and ruining them for himself. Also, maybe he\u2019s looking for a reason to leave, everything feeling like just a little too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to hang out with you?\u201d Jungkook asks, brows knit together in confusion. He pulls himself up, body angled toward Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jimin mumbles, staring down at his hands in his lap. \u201cSorry, I...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um, love hanging out with you.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s cheeks are tinged pink as he says the words, shoulder brushing against Jimin\u2019s as he shuffles a little closer. \u201cI really mean it, you know. I missed you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth goes dry and he gives Jungkook a jerky nod, suddenly afraid of what might come out of his own mouth. His fingers twist into his t-shirt and he looks over at Jungkook, well aware of the heat in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he had. He\u2019d missed how easy it always was to come back home and fall into the summer groove with his friends and with Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s make ramen,\u201d Jimin suggests, standing up, a little startled by the fond look Jungkook\u2019s sending his way. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit,\u201d Jungkook instructs, grabbing Jimin\u2019s wrist again and tugging him down. \u201cI\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I\u2019ll make it. I know how you like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really? You know how I like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins at him as he heads toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin watches him disappear, eyes roaming over the ink painted onto his back, a simmering warmth flooding his chest. Maybe it was a crush. Maybe it had always been a crush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin had thought that after hanging out with Jungkook solo for an entire afternoon, seeing him again would be a little easier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But apparently his ridiculous heart has something else to say about the matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s out walking Shiro because his brother\u2019s a lazy ass and didn\u2019t want to wake up, but Shiro had been whining pitifully by the door. Jimin loves Shiro, so he doesn\u2019t mind taking over some of his responsibilities but he\u2019s beginning to think Jihyun\u2019s just taking advantage of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s out walking, minding his own business, whistling in the cool morning air when he sees someone jog down the sidewalk toward him. His eyes zero in on the guy\u2019s chiseled abdomen, his sculpted pecs, the top of a skull tattoo peeking over his shorts and \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck. Jimin knows that tattoo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook calls, pulling his headphones out to drape them over his neck. He lifts his hand in a wave and Jimin very pointedly doesn\u2019t look at the sweat collecting between Jungkook\u2019s tiddies, glistening in the sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except, well, he can\u2019t not stare and Jimin thinks he\u2019s going to <em>die</em> if he doesn\u2019t get to suck Jungkook\u2019s dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jimin says, waving back, hoping his voice doesn\u2019t actually sound as squeaky as he thinks it does. Shiro barks, straining at the leash, and Jimin reins him in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook slows down as he nears, eyeing Shiro with delight, his eyes wide and happy. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he coos, dropping to a crouch and holding his hand out for Shiro to sniff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shiro is notorious for hating strangers. He\u2019d even taken a while to grow comfortable around Jimin, especially since Jimin was always back and forth for university. Shiro takes the guard dog nature of Jindos to the next level; they have to put him outside every time they have guests. Jimin\u2019s about to warn Jungkook to back off when Shiro nuzzles his face into Jungkook\u2019s palm and Jimin\u2019s left gaping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty,\u201d Jungkook coos. \u201cWhat a good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin coughs past the sudden something in his throat, his face hot. \u201cAt least you have an excuse today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook peers up at him curiously. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor not wearing a shirt,\u201d Jimin grumbles, and Jungkook grins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI always have an excuse. It\u2019s summer.\u201d He drops onto his ass to play with Shiro properly, stretching his legs out. His shorts ride up his thick thighs and Jimin pretends his mouth doesn\u2019t water up. Jimin\u2019s never noticed before, but he has another tattoo on the top of his shoulder \u2014 a list of dates. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you named your dog after <em>Voltron</em>,\u201d Jungkook says in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Jimin exclaims, holding his palms out in defense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook peers at him with narrowed eyes, as if gauging whether he\u2019s telling the truth or not. Then he nods. \u201cWhen did you get a dog?\u201d He pats Shiro\u2019s side affectionately. He\u2019s got his phone in a strap around his bicep, and it tightens with the movement. Jimin licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s Jihyun\u2019s. I\u2019m just walking him today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shiro plops down onto his belly, resting his head on Jungkook\u2019s lap and Jungkook laughs in delight, scratching Shiro\u2019s head. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he loves you, too,\u201d Jimin says, settling down next to them with his legs crossed. The sidewalk\u2019s wide enough that he isn\u2019t worried about blocking anyone\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances up, something intense about his gaze. \u201cThink so?\u201d he asks, and somehow Jimin feels like he\u2019s talking about something else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin blushes a little harder, glancing down at Shiro. \u201cHe\u2019s usually pretty aggressive around strangers. We have to warn people before they come over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you can even walk him,\u201d Jungkook says, sly glint in his eyes, \u201cconsidering he\u2019s about as big as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jimin shrieks, swatting at Jungkook\u2019s arm. Jungkook just laughs, leaning out of his reach. \u201cHe\u2019s not that big and I\u2019m not that small.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty big and you\u2019re pretty small.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jungkook</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s cute,\u201d Jungkook grins, and Jimin\u2019s heart nearly bursts. \u201cI always thought you were more of a cat person since you\u2019re a kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a kitten!\u201d Jimin blurts, then his eyes widen in horror. \u201cI mean \u2014 A-a cat person!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook bursts into laughter, and Jimin buries his face in his hands, mortification seeping through his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin groans. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it first!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas I wrong?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s still laughing as he reaches out to pry Jimin\u2019s hands away from his face, grip gentle around his wrists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Jungkook lets go of his hands and taps his nose lightly with a finger. Jimin\u2019s eyes widen all over again, his stomach twisting into knots, and he swats Jungkook\u2019s hand out of the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jimin splutters. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get that tattoo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He really wants to know about all of them, but Jimin doesn\u2019t know how much he\u2019s ready to divulge during a random meeting on the sidewalk. \u201cThe one on your shoulder. The dates?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that. They\u2019re my family\u2019s birth dates. I got them done like two years ago. My first tattoo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin softens, his traitorous heart doing happy little flips in his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rubs the back of his head a little shyly, and Jimin\u2019s heart swells, ready to burst. He hasn\u2019t seen much of Jungkook\u2019s old shyness yet, but here he is, the same Jungkook he\u2019s always known. The same sweet, endearing Jungkook who loves his family and friends more than anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shiro whines, nosing against Jungkook\u2019s hand for attention, and Jimin starts in sudden realisation. His heart won\u2019t stop flip-flopping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fucked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ugh!</em>\u201d Jimin groans, falling face first into his bed, arms curled into himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A second later he\u2019s screaming into his pillow, legs kicking out as his brain helpfully flashes the selfie Jungkook posted to his Instagram this morning. He\u2019d been shirtless because apparently that\u2019s how Jungkook spent all his time now and <em>wet</em>, his caption something about how he\u2019d gone for a swim that morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is he so hot for!\u201d Jimin exclaims, half the words muffled into his pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung shoves him over to make space for himself, rolling his eyes. \u201cCan you two just, like, jump each other already and spare me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, how many months did I listen to you telling me about how you wanted to, and I quote, feel Yoongi-hyung\u2019s spent dick twitching down your throat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung lets out a shriek of mortification, shoving at Jimin hard enough that he nearly topples right off the bed. Jimin can\u2019t stop laughing, cheeks hurting and eyes wet, as he looks at how Taehyung\u2019s gone redder than a tomato.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was drunk when I sent that text!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess drunk you thinks exclusively with his dick,\u201d Jimin snorts, lying on his side as he stares up at Taehyung. He sighs, grabbing his phone back from Taehyung\u2019s hand to stare longingly at Jungkook\u2019s selfie again. \u201cIf he told me to jump, I\u2019d ask how high daddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, this is serious huh?\u201d Taehyung asks, patting Jimin\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want him to blow my back out. I want him fuck me so hard, he rearranges my guts. I want \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, slow down, you fucking hoe,\u201d Taehyung interrupts, nose wrinkling up. \u201cI get it, you want to fuck Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the worst summer of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you spend a summer at math camp?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love math,\u201d Jimin grumbles, but Taehyung makes a good point. That had been a particularly awful summer mostly because mosquitoes love Jimin and he did not love mosquitoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou disgust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit there in silence, Jimin going through Jungkook\u2019s thirst trap of an Instagram and Taehyung shaking his head like he knows Jimin\u2019s a lost cause. And he is, he is one hundred and ten percent a lost cause. Ever since he accepted that, yes, he had a Crush<b>TM</b> on Jungkook, his feelings have actually gotten more impossible to deal with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung flops down onto the bed next to him, pulling Jimin\u2019s arm over so he can scroll through Jungkook\u2019s Instagram with him. There aren\u2019t a ton of posts, but there are enough that Jimin easily has a spank bank\u2019s worth of material.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think he has his dick pierced, too?\u201d Taehyung asks nonchalantly, finger hovering over a post Jungkook\u2019s made to show off his forearm tattoo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin has spent too many nights pouring over all of Jungkook\u2019s body modification posts, perhaps a little obsessively, but hasn\u2019t quite let his mind drift off to dick piercings. \u201cYou seem rather invested in Jungkook\u2019s hotness for someone who\u2019s taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have eyes, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about Yoongi with his dick pierced, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will neither confirm nor deny this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Jimin groans, shoving at Taehyung. He lets his phone fall onto his chest and sighs, staring up at his bedroom ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m doomed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, there. You\u2019ll get to gargle his nut sauce eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s contemplating if he can get away with jumping onto Jungkook\u2019s back and demanding to be piggy-backed home when Jungkook falls back in step with him, cutting that fantasy short.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jungkook asks, hands stuffed into the pockets of his shorts. For the first time since Jimin\u2019s seen him all summer, Jungkook\u2019s actually wearing a shirt. He frowns at it, hand reaching out to tug on the material.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jimin giggles, buzzed from the soju he\u2019d knocked back at the bar. Taehyung had dragged them all out to celebrate because his boyfriend had made it into town for a week. Yoongi is small and a little terrifying but mostly just smitten with Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Jungkook quirks up an eyebrow at him, and Jimin feels like he\u2019s bubbling with happiness, giggling even more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can handle my alcohol, you know,\u201d Jimin tells him matter of factly, proud of himself, his arm draping over Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. It\u2019s a bit of a strain but it lets him settle his head on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder easily, humming to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Jungkook grins, arm winding around Jimin\u2019s waist. He blushes as Jungkook squeezes him into his side, heartbeat pounding against his ears. Suddenly, Jungkook\u2019s face is too close and Jimin can see the little mole under Jungkook\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re all flushed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d Jimin insists even if he can feel the heat radiating off of his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re cute,\u201d Jungkook murmurs and Jimin\u2019s heart swoops right down to his belly, nearly tripping over his own feet. Jungkook steadies him, laughing, arm secure around Jimin. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay, Jimin-<em>ssi</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stop</em>,\u201d he whines, trying to squirm away but Jungkook holds him tight, and Jimin steadfastly ignores how it makes something hot coil in his belly. He tells himself he\u2019s not allowed to think about how hot it would be if Jungkook pinned him down, but he\u2019s drunk and his mind has other ideas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not even doing anything,\u201d Jungkook smirks even as Jimin whines, letting more of his weight settle against Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very unfair,\u201d Jimin tells him, hand fisting into his t-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook asks, eyebrow quirking. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know <em>how</em>,\u201d Jimin accuses, eyes narrowing at Jungkook as he bursts out laughing. God, Jimin wants to kiss him so bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It sobers him up, the way Jungkook laughs, Jimin\u2019s heart feeling ready to burst through his chest. Had Jungkook always looked at him like that? Eyes sparkling, his undivided attention fixed solely on Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin lets go of Jungkook\u2019s t-shirt, pulling away a little. The stud in Jungkook\u2019s nose glitters in the moonlight, catching his attention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you, um, get your nose pierced?\u201d Jimin asks, the alcohol loosening him up enough to actually reach over and boop Jungkook\u2019s nose. He laughs at Jimin\u2019s childishness, grin widening as his nose crinkles up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? You like it?\u201d Jungkook teases, arm still wrapped firmly around Jimin\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin only nods, not trusting himself to say anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it after Christmas. My grandparents gave me enough money for it and a tattoo,\u201d Jungkook explains, his hand drifting a little lower along Jimin\u2019s side. \u201cAlthough, they were probably hoping I\u2019d use the money for something else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen in acknowledgement, mouth a little dry. \u201cWhich tattoo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook grabs Jimin\u2019s hand and guides it down to his hip rather slowly, dragging it over the hard planes of his abdomen, eyes dark with something Jimin doesn\u2019t want to name. \u201cThis one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth goes dry and he actually trips, body twisted around by Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, careful!\u201d Jungkook catches him easily, righting him up, and it\u2019s then that Jimin notices the loud yelling coming from up the street.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face is aflame, and he refuses to look at Jungkook so he stares in the direction of the noise. His heart sinks immediately. The hand Jungkook has resting on his hip stills, and Jimin knows he\u2019s seen him, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin turns away quickly, wishes he could just disappear into nothingness. He feels nauseous, anxiety spiking. This isn\u2019t how he wanted his night to end. He doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to see his shitty, cheating ex.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, hyung, you\u2019d look really pretty with your nose pierced,\u201d Jungkook says, his tone light. Jimin finally looks up at him, a little startled. Jungkook had seen him right? He furrows his brows in confusion and Jungkook traces a thumb over them, smiling at Jimin softly. \u201cYou ever thought about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noise his ex and his ex\u2019s friends are making only gets louder and Jimin sucks in a big breath, eyes squeezing shut, shaking his head. Jungkook\u2019s moving, Jimin can feel him as he shifts to Jimin\u2019s left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Jungkook tells him, hand finding Jimin\u2019s. Their fingers lace together, Jimin squeezing for dear life. He looks at Jungkook before glancing up ahead. Taehyung\u2019s already slowed down, gaze settled on Jimin. He waves him off and then Jungkook\u2019s gently pulling him along, blocking Jimin\u2019s line of sight. He can\u2019t see Kiyong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels like a pinch and then it\u2019s over.\u201d Jungkook keeps talking, catching them up to everyone else. Namjoon smiles at him reassuringly and Jimin\u2019s fine. He has his friends around him and it\u2019s been four years. Jimin\u2019s moved on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook squeezes his hand, smiling at Jimin so sweetly that Jimin feels breathless. He feels so lucky he thinks he might actually cry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walk past Kiyong without incident, and it almost seems like he didn\u2019t even notice Jimin or his friends. He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s grateful for it or upset, that Kiyong really thought so little of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m gonna head home,\u201d Jimin says quietly once they\u2019re a good distance away from Kiyong and his friends. He doesn\u2019t want to look at anyone, already pulling away from Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s head snaps up at him and Jungkook looks determined, a stubborn set to his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him,\u201d Taehyung says, already pulling Jimin into a hug. He rocks them back and forth, Jimin thankful of his presence. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jimin-ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you, Taetae,\u201d Jimin mumbles, feeling bad for dampening everyone\u2019s mood. Yoongi ruffles his hair and smiles at him when Taehyung finally lets go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you, too, Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung smiles, pinching Jimin\u2019s cheeks. He swats Taehyung\u2019s hands away, offering up a watery smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get home too late,\u201d Namjoon says to Jungkook before giving Jimin a hug, too. \u201cAnd you make sure you drink lots of water before bed.\u201d He gives Jimin this stern look that pulls a genuine smile out of Jimin before he\u2019s nodding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Goodnight everyone,\u201d Jimin says softly, Jungkook guiding him up a side street to head off toward Jimin\u2019s house. They walk in silence, street lamps lighting their path, hands held together. Jimin tries his best not to think about Kiyong, about how he\u2019d been Jimin\u2019s first boyfriend and first kiss. His first love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It still makes him angry sometimes. Upset that all his memories with Kiyong would always reek of how he\u2019d broken Jimin\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know when they reach his house, Jungkook leading them up the steps to his door before looking back at him. He smiles and Jimin can\u2019t help it, reaching forward to hug him, face burying into Jungkook\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook smells like laundry detergent and orange blossoms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin knows he should let go but he doesn\u2019t want to and Jungkook just holds him, arms wrapped tight around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you Jungkook,\u201d Jimin whispers eventually, heart heavy in his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re really the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs, the feeling rumbling through Jimin as he gives him one last squeeze for the night. He brushes Jimin\u2019s hair out of his eyes, smiling. \u201cNah, you\u2019re definitely bester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin rolls his eyes, shoving weakly at Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, flushing a little. \u201cText me when you get home, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook promises and then he leans forward and presses a kiss to Jimin\u2019s forehead, smiling softly at him. Jimin\u2019s breath catches in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll, um, see you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin just nods, doesn\u2019t trust himself to speak. Jungkook makes it to the little gate at the front of Jimin\u2019s house before he looks back, waving at him. \u201cGo inside, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Kay,\u201d Jimin agrees, opening his front door. \u201cNight Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNight!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Predictably, Jimin wakes up with a hangover, but his misery extends beyond the brutal headache and dry mouth. Even though it had gone better than he could have hoped, seeing Kiyong has shaken him up. He feels a little lost as he shuffles to the kitchen for water, shivering even though it isn\u2019t cold. His house is empty \u2014 his parents are out at work, and Jihyun\u2019s off on a weekend trip with friends. Somehow the emptiness makes everything worse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slumps on the couch in front of the TV that he doesn\u2019t bother turning on. He should make himself some breakfast, brew a cup of coffee, take some aspirin. But Jimin just sits there, the hollowness in his chest too difficult to chase away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The doorbell rings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He winces, rubbing his temples, then frowns. He isn\u2019t expecting anyone. Yanking a blanket off the couch and tugging it over his shoulders, he heads to open the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s standing there with a grocery bag that looks full to the brim in sweats and a white t-shirt, hair loose and unstyled. A smile brightens his face at the sight of Jimin. He holds up the bag. \u201cBrought hangover goods.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the risk of being dramatic, Jimin thinks he might cry. He swallows past the lump in his throat and steps aside so Jungkook can come in. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do all that,\u201d he mumbles, and Jungkook throws him a smile over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my haul yet. What if it isn\u2019t even that great?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been to Jimin\u2019s house before, so he makes himself comfortable on the couch, removing what looks like a container of soup from the bag. It\u2019s followed by snacks, a few DVDs, and a bag of ground coffee. Jimin stands there watching him, the damn lump still lodged in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course it\u2019s great,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cEverything you do is great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks up at him and laughs like he thinks Jimin\u2019s just being silly. But Jimin means it. \u201cCome sit.\u201d He pats the couch next to him like it\u2019s his house, not Jimin\u2019s. Jimin shuffles over and sits down, their shoulders brushing. The warmth of Jungkook\u2019s body next to his drives some of the emptiness away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really bring a whole bag of coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, I didn\u2019t know if you had any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even like coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean remember?\u201d Jimin scoffs, shoving at him. \u201cI know everything about you, Jeon Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook murmurs, his gaze soft as it settles on Jimin. \u201cI have changed, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d Jimin says, because he\u2019s realised it\u2019s mostly true. He\u2019s confident, sure of himself in a way that he wasn\u2019t before but he\u2019s still the same old Jungkook. Sweet and sometimes shy and full of love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin thinks what\u2019s really changed is his place in Jungkook\u2019s life. He\u2019d always showered Jungkook with affection in a way that probably overwhelmed him. Jimin hadn\u2019t ever been sure if Jungkook saw him as anything other than his annoying hyung, but it\u2019s different now. Jungkook gives affection back like it\u2019s nothing, seeks Jimin out without prompting. Jimin doesn\u2019t have to wonder if Jungkook enjoys his company anymore. It\u2019s obvious that he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do have a coffee maker, right?\u201d Jungkook says, as if he hadn\u2019t thought of it before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles. \u201cI do. Come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I got it. You have some soup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jimin tries to get up anyway, Jungkook presses him back into the couch with his hands on his shoulders. \u201cStay,\u201d he says firmly, and Jimin stays.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hangover soup never tastes that great, but Jimin drinks it all anyway as he listens to Jungkook bustle around the kitchen. Brewing coffee doesn\u2019t take that long, but quite a few minutes pass without the smell drifting into the living room and Jimin starts to wonder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie?\u201d he calls, setting the empty container of soup on the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook calls back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence. Then a shameful, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin bursts into laughter, running his hands over his face. He stands up and joins Jungkook in the kitchen where he\u2019s staring at the coffee machine like it\u2019s some alien technology. \u201cMove,\u201d he orders, bumping Jungkook aside with his hip. Jungkook watches him set up the machine, shame-faced. \u201cDo you want some?\u201d Jimin teases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook glares at him. He tugs open Jimin\u2019s fridge and pours himself a glass of milk instead. Jimin snickers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the coffee\u2019s done, they return to the living room, and Jungkook puts on one of the movies. Jimin\u2019s already feeling leagues better. He tucks himself back into his blanket and sips on his coffee. Jungkook returns to sit next to him; it\u2019s a big couch, but he stays right by Jimin\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Jungkook asks, and Jimin can tell by the seriousness of his tone that he\u2019s talking about Kiyong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Jimin murmurs, taking the leap and leaning into Jungkook\u2019s side, \u201cnow that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook slips his arm around Jimin\u2019s waist easily, like it was meant to be there and Jimin rests his head on his shoulder. He pulls Jungkook\u2019s hand into his lap, playing with his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook presses his cheek against Jimin\u2019s head. \u201cSure thing, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The movie\u2019s on but Jimin doesn\u2019t really want to pay attention. He runs a light finger along the tattoo on Jungkook\u2019s forearm, the snake hidden among the flowers. He watches goosebumps erupt on Jungkook\u2019s skin. \u201cI like this one,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook shifts his arm so Jimin can see it better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any tats, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cI want one, I just haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin glances up at him, and Jungkook looks perfectly genuine. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold your hand while you cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jimin shrieks, elbowing him. \u201cWho says I\u2019m gonna cry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin huffs, nuzzling back into his side. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A throaty meow announces Moya\u2019s arrival; she slinks around the couch, nose in the air, probably wondering who\u2019s over. Jimin\u2019s willing to bet she\u2019s already spent five minutes sniffing Jungkook\u2019s shoes by the door before making her way to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMoya,\u201d Jungkook calls, delighted, pulling away from Jimin to reach for her instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jimin grumbles, missing Jungkook\u2019s warmth already.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moya sniffs his fingers for a good minute before she decides to leap onto the couch and settle in Jungkook\u2019s lap. He pets her happily, and Jimin glares at them both, feeling forgotten. Jungkook feels his gaze and looks over, a grin splitting his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, kitten\u2019s not getting enough attention?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin blushes all the way to his chest, mortified. \u201c<em>Jungkook</em>, oh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have two hands.\u201d He leaves one on Moya\u2019s back and puts the other on Jimin\u2019s hair, petting him too. \u201cBetter, kitten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, shut up.\u201d Jimin\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to burst into flames with how hard he\u2019s blushing. The worst part is he <em>likes</em> the way Jungkook says that. And he can\u2019t help leaning into Jungkook\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, told you you were just like a cat,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cMy calico cat.\u201d He glances pointedly at Moya\u2019s patched fur.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Jimin whines, burying his face in Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, which he supposes is counterintuitive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs, and his voice comes muffled against Jungkook\u2019s shirt. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the worst day of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s announcement comes from his upside-down vantage point as he hangs off Taehyung\u2019s bed. He\u2019s kind of hoping all the blood rushing to his head will knock some sense into him. Currently, his brain\u2019s a muddled mess of <em>Jungkook Jungkook Jungkook</em> and frankly, he\u2019s tired of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can objectively tell you right now that that\u2019s not true,\u201d Namjoon says. Jimin feels him kick his foot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Jimin groans, flailing his arms above his head. He\u2019s starting to think all the blood rushing to his head is actually having the opposite effect. Now he\u2019s even <em>more</em> stressed about Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you sit up before you pass out?\u201d Taehyung mutters, grabbing Jimin\u2019s ankle and yanking. He only succeeds at knocking Jimin\u2019s head against the bed. \u201cAnd maybe tell us why you\u2019re in a bad mood when you were having so much fun at the party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d Jimin whines, rubbing his head and finally sitting up. \u201cThat hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung just stares at him, impervious to his pouting after all these years. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Jungkook,\u201d he guesses, and Jimin sighs, burying his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels silly, like he shouldn\u2019t be upset. Like it isn\u2019t his place to be upset. But he\u2019s upset, and he doesn\u2019t know what to do about it \u2014 not that there\u2019s anything he <em>can</em> do about it. Feelings, unfortunately, don\u2019t answer to your brain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened with Jungkook?\u201d Namjoon asks, confused. He and Yoongi had been holed up in a corner of the party, locked in some intense discussion that no one had dared to interrupt. Taehyung had been a little pouty that he didn\u2019t have Yoongi\u2019s attention all to himself, but mostly he was used to it \u2014 everyone knew the two of them were impossible to stop once they got started.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Jimin mumbles. \u201cHe was just flirting with someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon looks dubious. \u201cJungkook? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because he was talking to a girl \u2014 \u201d Taehyung starts, exasperated, but Jimin cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t <em>just</em> talking to a girl. He also had his hand on her waist and their faces were like two inches away from each other \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprise, parties are fucking loud and you can\u2019t hear shit \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin snatches the pillow next to Namjoon and lobs it in Taehyung\u2019s direction. \u201cStop invalidating my feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not invalidating your feelings, you dramatic hoe. I\u2019m only saying maybe don\u2019t jump to conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just really like him,\u201d Jimin whines, face-planting onto the bed, his legs bent awkwardly beneath him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels a hand on the back of his head, stroking his hair gently. It must be Namjoon because Taehyung\u2019s being a bitch, and he never pets Jimin when he\u2019s being a bitch. \u201cThis is serious, huh?\u201d Namjoon says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin straightens again, frowning. He crawls over to Namjoon and drapes himself over his back. \u201cHey hyung, it doesn\u2019t bother you, does it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would it bother me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your little brother. I don\u2019t wanna make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon snorts. \u201cJust quit flirting in front of me and we\u2019re good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon reaches back to pat Jimin\u2019s ass. \u201cMe too, Jiminie. I don\u2019t mind. This has kind of been a long time coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you guys are the ones being dramatic. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been <em>pining</em> over each other for years or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d Taehyung snickers, and Jimin glares at him in lieu of throwing the other pillow, but only because Namjoon\u2019s sitting on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Namjoon says pointedly. \u201cIf you like him this much, you should really think about talking to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin slides off Namjoon and sighs. \u201cYou always have to be the mature one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a dramatic hoe, like I said,\u201d Taehyung says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no room to talk, Kim Taehyung. You and Yoongi-hyung took fucking forever to start dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Namjoon agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\u201d Taehyung complains. \u201cThis is about Jimin and his lovestruck ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLovestruck,\u201d Jimin laments. \u201cI really am lovestruck. Can you believe it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon and Taehyung glance at each other. \u201cYes,\u201d they intone, and Jimin faceplants onto the bed again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s dangling his feet in the shallow end of the pool, water sparkling prettily in the nighttime darkness. The water sloshes around his calves as Jimin sits there, mind fixated on Jungkook. It had a tendency of doing that lately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin had ended up at Namjoon and Jungkook\u2019s house after Taehyung had not-so-subtly told him he wanted to spend Yoongi\u2019s last day in town with him. Alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have a secret third wheeling kink and he hadn\u2019t felt like lazing around at home by himself, so he\u2019d come over unannounced and the three of them had spent the evening hanging out. It had been a good night, even if by the end of the first hour, Namjoon had had enough of Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s flirting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt bad, but not bad enough, the image of the girl Jungkook had been flirting with a couple nights ago still playing behind his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin finds it a little hard to believe how much has changed in a month, at least in regards to his feelings toward Jungkook. He\u2019d spent all evening practically glued to Jungkook\u2019s side, enjoying the way Jungkook smiled at him and how his arm felt wrapped around Jimin\u2019s shoulders. He\u2019d almost forgotten about all his angst until Jungkook had started texting someone, a giant grin on his face the entire time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sighs, pouting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing out here?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice travels down to him from the sliding doors at the back of the house and Jimin jumps a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t been able sleep after their hangout-session-turned-sleepover so he\u2019d ended up outside by the pool, always content near any kind of body of water. Jimin glances back, watches Jungkook walk over to him carefully, shirtless. Always shirtless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin appreciates the sight, his shorts hanging low on his hips. He smiles when Jungkook stops next to him, staring down at Jimin. From this angle, all Jimin\u2019s brain can do is think dirty thoughts, like how easy it\u2019d be for him to crawl onto his knees and tug Jungkook\u2019s shorts down. He doesn\u2019t let his mind wander further, whipping his head away, cheeks flushing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he answers, kicking at the water with his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook hums in understanding, settling down next to Jimin. Their shoulders and arms press against one another or a fleeting moment, heat radiating off of their skin. Jungkook draws his knees to his chest, arms wrapping around his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jimin asks, looking over at Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWanted some water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d Jungkook asks, neck craning up to look at the sky. The stars are out, night sky clear of clouds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t say what he\u2019s <em>really</em> thinking about, the possibilities swimming through his mind. Jungkook looks impossibly handsome in profile, Jimin\u2019s heartbeat loud in his ears. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs, head falling to rest on his arms, his eyes crinkling up as he smiles. \u201cReally? Nothing? I didn\u2019t know your head was that empty, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d Jimin shrieks, shoving at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s laughing as he returns the shove, pushing a little more forcefully. Jimin nearly loses his balance, steadying himself on a hand before retaliating. \u201cYah!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin shoves Jungkook hard enough that he topples right over into the water, the splash of his body penetrating the water soaking Jimin thoroughly even as he shrieks with laughter. Jungkook\u2019s breaking the surface, gasping for air as Jimin giggles, falling back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin gasps, curled up into himself as he laughs, arms pulled to his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for teasing me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s pushing his hair back out of his eyes, biceps flexing as he floats in the water, grinning. \u201cOh, is that how you want to play?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen, immediately pulling away from the edge of the pool, faster than Jungkook can get to him. Jungkook just misses grabbing Jimin\u2019s ankle, Jimin laughing at Jungkook\u2019s frustrated growl, his eyes narrowed as he rests against the edge of the pool, arms holding his weight up. He sticks his tongue out, giggling and very delighted with himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jungkook grumbles, pushing away from the edge and backstroking further into the pool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill don\u2019t like losing, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho likes losing?\u201d Jungkook tosses back, halfway down the length of the pool. Jimin deems it safe enough to shuffle back over, still careful to keep his legs pulled up toward his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t get upset <em>baby</em>,\u201d Jimin taunts, snickering when Jungkook stills in the water to look over at him. For a split second he looks like he\u2019s going to yank Jimin into the water, kicking and screaming if he has to, and then the expression melts off his face and he smiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby huh?\u201d Jungkook grins, swimming back toward him. He comes slowly, Jimin\u2019s eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cAm I your baby, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart nearly leaps out of his chest at the question, eyes widening at the cheeky grin on Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cN-no!\u201d he sputters, heat blooming across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s laughing, already back in Jimin\u2019s personal space. He swims right up to the edge and settles next to Jimin, smirking confidently up at him. Jimin wants to wipe the smug look right off his face but he\u2019s so flustered, he doesn\u2019t have any kind of comeback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do more than just suck,\u201d Jungkook tells him, eyebrows waggling, and Jimin\u2019s left gaping at him, hot blush creeping all the way down his neck and all the way up to his ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Jimin can let out the scandalized <em>Jungkook</em> sitting on the tip of his tongue, Jungkook\u2019s grabbed him by the arm, lightning fast, and yanked him into the pool. He falls in face first, breaking through the water until he\u2019s sinking in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s caught completely off guard, flailing as he attempts to get back to the surface, gasping for air. Jungkook\u2019s laughter rings through the quiet of the night, contagious and bright, and Jimin\u2019s shock is replaced with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got me wet!\u201d he whines, splashing water in Jungkook\u2019s direction as he pouts. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou keep saying that,\u201d Jungkook says, swimming close enough to Jimin that he can grab him by the t-shirt and pull him in close. Jimin pushes away immediately, attempting to get away but Jungkook is relentless, swimming closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s back hits the side of the pool, heart lodging in his throat as Jungkook closes the gap entirely, arms caging him in. He tries to swallow, hands settled on Jungkook\u2019s bare chest, eyes dropping down to his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bad decision. Droplets of water trail down Jungkook\u2019s skin enticingly and Jimin\u2019s mouth goes dry, eyes fixing on Jungkook\u2019s sharp clavicles, belly twisting itself into knots.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really hate me?\u201d Jungkook whispers, body pressed against Jimin\u2019s. If he wanted to, Jimin could duck under Jungkook\u2019s arm and swim away but he can\u2019t move, heartbeat thudding against his chest so hard, Jimin can\u2019t hear himself think.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, daring to look up at Jungkook and immediately regretting it, knowing he won\u2019t be able to look away. <em>Shit</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is looking at him with such an intensity that Jimin forgets to breathe, his face inching closer. His body feels electric, like he might burst at any second and still Jungkook inches closer, his hands smoothing down Jimin\u2019s sides to settle on his waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, hyung,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, their bodies floating in the water. Jimin\u2019s fingers dig into Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, butterflies swarming together in his belly. Jungkook leans in that little bit more, nose brushing against Jimin\u2019s, and Jimin\u2019s entire world skitters to a stop, breath caught in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook keeps his eyes locked with Jimin\u2019s, heat curling in Jimin\u2019s belly like a serpent, tighter and tighter, and yet somehow, it still feels like he\u2019s the one about to be devoured. The hands on his waist travel higher, palms smoothing over Jimin\u2019s bare skin and there\u2019s no way Jungkook can\u2019t feel how hard his heart is beating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Patience may be a virtue, but Jimin\u2019s run out of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closes the gap, shuddering when his lips press against Jungkook\u2019s, eyes slipping shut. Jimin\u2019s arms wrap around Jungkook, their bodies are flush together, head tilting to the side as Jungkook\u2019s mouth presses against his harder. Jimin lets himself suck on Jungkook\u2019s bottom lip, licking at the seam of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What he\u2019s not expecting is the way Jungkook grabs him, hands gripping him by the thighs and hefting him up, Jimin\u2019s legs wrapping around his waist automatically. He gasps, mouth parting and Jungkook\u2019s tongue slides against Jimin\u2019s own, a hot flash rushing through him as his body pulses with want.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin whines into the kiss, feels like Jungkook\u2019s drawn the breath right out of his lungs, his mind hazy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It only serves to rile Jungkook up, the kiss hungrier, messier, his tongue licking into Jimin\u2019s mouth as if he might disappear, his fingers digging into Jimin\u2019s thighs harder in his desperation. He\u2019s laid in bed all week, imagining what it would be like to kiss Jungkook, to taste him, but the giddy rush of happiness isn\u2019t something he could have anticipated, something he could have fathomed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can hardly breathe, but he doesn\u2019t want to pull away, hands fisting into Jungkook\u2019s wet hair as he licks and tastes Jungkook\u2019s mouth, moaning when Jungkook sucks on his bottom lip. A whimper escapes him when Jungkook nips against the flesh, the bite soothed by Jungkook\u2019s tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Jungkook breathes, tongue slipping back into Jimin\u2019s mouth, his nose digging into Jimin\u2019s cheek as they kiss. \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s fingers curl tighter in Jungkook\u2019s hair and it must hurt but Jungkook doesn\u2019t complain, kisses becoming less urgent as he pulls back, leisurely tracing the tip of his tongue along Jimin\u2019s cupid\u2019s bow and his upper lip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I...?\u201d Jungkook asks, kisses Jimin again and again and <em>again</em>. It leaves Jimin\u2019s mind a mess, emotions bubbling together until it feels like he\u2019s going to spill over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin gasps, nails digging into his shoulders as he finally manages to put some distance between them. He can\u2019t feel his face, heat radiating off of his cheeks, and Jungkook\u2019s looking at him like he\u2019s the center of his entire world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s trying to say, just that his head is a mess and he needs, he needs \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s cupping Jimin\u2019s face in his hands, leaning back in for a kiss, sweeter, and Jimin\u2019s heart is leaping out of his chest, eyes slipping shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice is so quiet, Jimin almost misses the question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nods, placing his hands over Jungkook\u2019s, and the growing immensity of the moment quells as he locks eyes with Jungkook. He can\u2019t remember kissing anyone and ever feeling so grounded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Jungkook whispers, smiling softly, his voice reverent, hands squeezing Jimin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI just wanna eat you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jungkook</em>.\u201d Jimin shoves at Jungkook\u2019s shoulder lightly, feels his face heat up more than he even thought possible, eyes flickering down. He swallows, the party from a couple days ago swimming to the forefront of his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the giddiness simmers down, Jimin\u2019s heart sinking. Jungkook tilts his chin up, curious eyes taking Jimin in. He leans in, their foreheads meeting, bodies bobbing in the water. He feels almost silly, letting his desires and feelings get ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d Jungkook asks, tilting Jimin\u2019s head a little higher, their lips almost meeting again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cW-wait!\u201d Jimin exclaims, palm pressing insistently against Jungkook\u2019s chest. His eyes meet Jungkook\u2019s, a look of concern meeting his. \u201cIs this \u2014 I mean,\u201d he sucks in a big breath, Jungkook\u2019s hands settling against his sides. Jimin chews on his bottom lip, not wanting to sound desperate. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a hookup, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really think that\u2019s all I want?\u201d Jungkook asks, voice a little tight, brows furrowed together. \u201cTo hook up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows, droplets of water trailing down his skin. And it\u2019s not that he doubts Jungkook, but that he can never get his brain to stop obsessing over his own undesirability. If Jimin had been enough, Kiyong never would have \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says quietly, unable to look Jungkook in the eyes. \u201cI can \u2014 I\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s frown deepens, adding distance between them. \u201cIs...is that what you want? To go home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jimin\u2019s mind is racing, images of the girl from the party flashing before his eyes. He remembers walking in on Kiyong and Soohee, will never forget it. Remembers their looks of shock, the way his heart had dropped out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s staring at him, waiting for a response and Jimin wants this, whatever this is. He doesn\u2019t want to ruin it before it even begins. Jimin wants to be brave, he wants to take the risk, wants to trust Jungkook because Jungkook\u2019s never given him reason not to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, t-the girl...\u201d He licks his lips, daring to look up at Jungkook, who only looks confused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, at the party. You were with a girl. You looked like you were \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Jungkook interrupts him, his voice coloured with disbelief and amusement. \u201cHyung, she\u2019s my friend. Chungha-noona\u2019s the reason I even \u2014 God, this is \u2014 Hyung you\u2019re so <em>cute</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin asks, not at all following Jungkook\u2019s train of thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone who was top of his class, you\u2019re really clueless, hyung,\u201d Jungkook smiles, pulling Jimin into a hug. He\u2019s too stunned to say anything, arms wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s wet torso automatically. He can hear Jungkook\u2019s heartbeat, head pressed to his chest, and it\u2019s going as fast as Jimin\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing top of my class doesn\u2019t mean I can read your mind, you brat,\u201d Jimin grumbles, smacking him in the side. Jungkook only laughs, squeezing Jimin tighter. Then he\u2019s lifting Jimin up, pulling a yelp out of him, and Jimin finds himself sitting on the edge of the pool, Jungkook grinning up at him as he floats between his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChungha-noona is my friend. I\u2019m not, uh, interested in girls,\u201d Jungkook explains to him, taking one of Jimin\u2019s hands in his own, his other arm coming to rest on Jimin\u2019s thigh. \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve liked you, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen, managing a shake of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor as long as I can remember,\u201d Jungkook confesses, \u201cand I\u2019d kinda given up hope that you\u2019d ever like me back, that you\u2019d stop seeing me as some kid. Chungha-noona\u2019s the one who told me to stop moping and go for it. So \u2014 so no, this isn\u2019t a hookup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s looking up at him so earnestly that Jimin\u2019s chest tightens, lungs squeezing the air out of him. He thinks his heart might burst. \u201cI do like you,\u201d Jimin says softly, cupping Jungkook\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s smile is blinding, spreading across his face until his nose crinkles up in delight and then he\u2019s surging forward to kiss Jimin, hand curling around the back of Jimin\u2019s neck. Jimin draws him in, hands dragging him closer as he wraps his arms around Jungkook, mouth parting as Jungkook licks filthily in, tongue swiping against the sensitive roof of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cock twitches, a whine escaping him, and he feels helpless to Jungkook\u2019s intensity, overwhelmed but longing for more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear you say that,\u201d Jungkook breathes out, kisses Jimin between the words slipping out of his mouth. He moans when Jimin sucks on his tongue, returning Jungkook\u2019s fervor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s mouth leaves his and Jimin whines, chasing him as he pulls away, but Jungkook just laughs and holds him in place. His lips find Jimin\u2019s neck, the touch soft before he sucks a mark under Jimin\u2019s jaw that makes Jimin\u2019s toes curl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jimin breathes, but Jungkook isn\u2019t done yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He fists a hand in Jimin\u2019s hair and pulls his head back, baring Jimin\u2019s neck for him, his lips dragging down his throat. He works Jimin\u2019s skin between his lips, sucking hard, and Jimin moans, arching into him. His tongue laves over the tender spot, and Jimin winds his arms tighter around Jungkook, spine tingling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls back just enough to look at the product of his kisses, running a light finger over the marks. \u201cPretty,\u201d he murmurs, and Jimin flushes red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be able to go anywhere,\u201d Jimin whines. \u201cIt\u2019s summer, I can\u2019t even wear a scarf \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s mouth finds his neck again and Jimin\u2019s words break off into a whimper, his lashes fluttering. \u201cGood,\u201d he says, and Jimin can feel his lips move against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s pulling at his shirt, the wet material clinging to Jimin\u2019s skin and it\u2019s a relief to take it off, even if it leaves him half-naked. He shivers under Jungkook\u2019s gaze, heart hammering against his ribs, as he leans forward and kisses Jimin\u2019s bare skin. He leaves gentle kisses \u00a0against Jimin\u2019s collarbones, a contrast to how he\u2019d ravaged Jimin\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s mouth travels lower, tongue laving over Jimin\u2019s hardened nipples. He bites against one of them, Jimin arching away from the touch even as a jolt of desire throbs all the way down to his cock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s half hard, knows Jungkook could probably see the outline of his cock against his shorts if he looked down. For all of Jimin\u2019s growing distress over how hot Jungkook is, he doesn\u2019t want to rush into anything if that\u2019s not what Jungkook wants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jungkook proves him wrong, keeps proving him wrong, pushing Jimin\u2019s worries aside when his hand palms over Jimin\u2019s cock, pulling a strangled moan out of him. \u201cYou get hard for me, kitten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cheeks heat up at the question, eyes narrowing. \u201cWho else would \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs at his embarrassment, reaching up to kiss him. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re flustered,\u201d he murmurs, his other hand trailing down Jimin\u2019s back until his fingers dip into the waistband of his shorts. He squeezes Jimin\u2019s ass, kisses him harder, enjoying the way Jimin goes pliant. \u201cCome on, kitten. Tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hands cling to Jungkook\u2019s shoulders, simultaneously wanting to shove him away and pull him in closer. \u201cTell you what?\u201d he breathes out when Jungkook pulls back enough to let him answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me how bad you want this,\u201d Jungkook says, leaves a trail of kisses along Jimin\u2019s jaw until he\u2019s biting down on a lobe, sucking it into his hot mouth. It makes Jimin\u2019s cock throb, a keening moan filling the air. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not being shy,\u201d Jimin retorts, nails digging into Jungkook\u2019s skin, arousal a spreading fire as it sparks down his spine, heat simmering in his belly. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just...?\u201d Jungkook encourages, kisses the skin just behind Jimin\u2019s ear. It sends a shiver running through him, Jimin curling into himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShameless,\u201d he breathes as Jungkook nips at his skin, sucking a mark so far up on his neck, it\u2019ll be impossible for Jimin to cover it up. He whines at the realization, his hand falling on top of Jungkook\u2019s where it\u2019s resting on his thigh. Jimin guides it to his neglected cock, grinding into Jungkook\u2019s palm, moaning when Jungkook\u2019s tongue laves at the mark he\u2019s sucked into Jimin\u2019s skin, kissing it open-mouthed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s impatient,\u201d Jungkook smirks, eyebrow cocked as he pulls away from Jimin\u2019s neck, tugging Jimin\u2019s shorts down. He slips Jimin\u2019s cock out, hard and leaking, as it curves upwards to Jimin\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhose fault is that?\u201d Jimin bites back, but his hips stutter up when Jungkook wraps a hand around his cock, his whole body thrumming with anticipation, skin flushed as he looks down at Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s mine,\u201d Jungkook grins, kissing Jimin just under his chin. \u201cEven your cock is cute, kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cH-hey!\u201d Jimin whines but it feels so good to have Jungkook\u2019s hand around his length, Jimin can\u2019t hold onto his annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCute kitten with a cute cock,\u201d Jungkook smiles up at him before his head dips forward, and Jimin\u2019s whole body clenches as Jungkook\u2019s lips touch his cock. He kisses the tip, tongue flat as he licks the underside of the head, mouth wet and hot, and Jimin moans louder than he has all night when Jungkook wraps his lips completely around the head, sucking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like his brain is short circuiting, Jungkook sinking further and further down, a hand coming to cover his mouth, embarrassed by the sounds he\u2019s making. Jungkook hums around his cock, sinking all the way down to his pelvis, Jimin\u2019s cock hitting the back of his throat. Jimin\u2019s hand fists into his hair, voice cracking as he moans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Jungkook pulls back, he lets his tongue drag along the underside of his cock, Jimin\u2019s lungs tightening at the sensation. It feels so good, Jimin\u2019s head is going blank, nearly forgetting that they\u2019re sitting out by the Jeon family pool where any of the neighbours could see them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he whines, tugging on Jungkook\u2019s hair. He thinks he\u2019s only managed to sit up this long because Jungkook\u2019s got one of his hands digging into Jimin\u2019s ass, the other pulling his shorts down lower. \u201cJ-Jungkook, we\u2019re \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls back enough just to suck on the head of Jimin\u2019s cock insistently, the tip of his tongue dragging along the bottom of his cockhead. It sends tingles down his spine, cock throbbing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone could s-see,\u201d Jimin whimpers, eyes squeezing shut when Jungkook\u2019s hand fondles his balls as he lazily swirls his tongue around Jimin\u2019s cockhead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jungkook asks with a pop, lips red and swollen, and Jimin\u2019s so close to just collapsing backwards, breath shuddering through his chest. He licks up the length of Jimin\u2019s cock before sucking it back into his mouth, head bobbing as he blows Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we shou \u2014 <em>Oh</em>,\u201d Jimin moans, Jungkook swallowing around the head of his cock as he takes his cock all the way down. The pressure is almost too much, Jimin\u2019s hand tightening in Jungkook\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s pulling off again, spit dribbling down his chin as he heaves, looking up at Jimin. \u201cWe should let them see,\u201d Jungkook says darkly, a look in his eyes that makes Jimin\u2019s belly twist into itself. He\u2019s so <em>fucked</em>. \u201cLet them see what a slutty little kitten I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cock twitches in Jungkook\u2019s hold at his words, an embarrassed whine slipping out, and Jungkook\u2019s smile sharpens, smug, kissing Jimin sloppily as his hand works over Jimin\u2019s length. \u201cYou like that, kitten? Like it when I call you that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can barely form a coherent thought, face on fire, but he nods mutely, liking the burn of shame that runs through him, how it makes his cock throb with need.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, what a pretty kitten,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, kissing Jimin sweetly before he pulls back, his hand still working up and down on Jimin\u2019s cock, pace agonisingly slow. \u201cSo well behaved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin pleads, his shorts tugged down even lower, ass meeting the cool edge of the pool. Jungkook gets Jimin completely naked, his shorts and underwear both ending up floating on the pool\u2019s surface before Jungkook\u2019s leaning back down to swallow his cock into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook sets a steady pace, nudges Jimin\u2019s legs wider apart to give himself more room, pushing Jimin down in the process. Jimin finds himself half in the grass and half on the concrete surrounding the pool\u2019s perimeter, chest heaving as Jungkook sucks him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jimin whines, hands curling into Jungkook\u2019s thick hair, wanting to look down at Jungkook but unable to keep his eyes open. \u201cWanna come, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook only hums around him, taking Jimin\u2019s entire length down his throat again. His hand massages Jimin\u2019s balls, a finger rubbing against his hole as he continues to suck, not even deterred when Jimin\u2019s hips buck upwards. Jungkook lets his mouth fall open as Jimin thrusts up into the wet heat of his mouth, a garbled moan leaving him as his fists tighten in Jungkook\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until Jungkook\u2019s pinning his hips down, Jimin\u2019s cock hitting the back of his throat that Jimin feels himself teetering on the edge, sucking in breath after breath. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 Jungkook \u2014 C-close!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls off Jimin\u2019s cock just long enough to suck in a breath. \u201cCome on, baby,\u201d he rasps, sinking back down on Jimin\u2019s length. This time when he swallows around the head of his cock, Jimin can\u2019t hold it off, crying out Jungkook\u2019s name as he spills down his throat, back leaving the ground. Jungkook keeps sucking, head bobbing as he swallows down Jimin\u2019s cum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin collapses back down, his hold on Jungkook\u2019s hair loosening as he blinks through the pleasure coursing through him, Jungkook\u2019s attention focused on sucking on the tip. His hand works over Jimin\u2019s length, milking him dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook finally pulls off his cock when Jimin\u2019s hip twitch upwards, the sensation too much as he hisses. He licks it clean and Jimin whines, catching Jungkook\u2019s attention. But Jungkook doesn\u2019t move, sucking a bruising mark against Jimin\u2019s hipbone before kissing it sweetly, crawling up his body, their eyes meeting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you didn\u2019t want anyone to see,\u201d Jungkook teases, hovering over Jimin as he attempts to catch his breath, body still pulsing with pleasure. \u201cPretty sure all the neighbors heard that, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Jimin mumbles out, trying his best to keep his eyes open, to take in the brilliance of Jungkook\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCause,\u201d Jimin says, licking his lips, reaching for Jungkook to draw him closer. \u201cI\u2019m your slutty little kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook curses, closing the distance between them to capture Jimin\u2019s mouth in a searing kiss. They makeout as Jimin lies there, both of them drying off in the cool summer air, the heavy length of Jungkook\u2019s cock pressing against his hip, a hot weight. He wants to return the favour but he also wants Jungkook to fuck him, mind unable to make a decision. \u201cShould have known you\u2019d have a filthy mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin pouts at that, flushing. \u201cLike you\u2019re any better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins, Jimin can feel it against his own mouth, their tongues brushing against one another. \u201cMmm, you caught me.\u201d He trails a hand down Jimin\u2019s side, gripping him by the hip. \u201cI\u2019d fuck you right here but \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Jimin interrupts, the high from his orgasm having waned a little, his alertness back. \u201cWant you to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLube, hyung,\u201d Jungkook reminds, snickering, sitting back up as he stares down at Jimin\u2019s prone body. He pushes himself up to his elbows, lips pursed together. Jungkook laughs, leaning in for a quick kiss. \u201cDefinitely a slutty little kitten, so impatient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picks Jimin up easily, Jimin squeaking as he finds himself in Jungkook\u2019s arms, his hands cupping Jimin\u2019s ass. Jimin stares at Jungkook\u2019s swollen mouth, lips pink and shiny, kissing him as Jungkook carries him toward the house. \u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d Jimin breathes, \u201creally good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood at what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGiving head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook smirks, sliding the back door open and stepping into the cool, darkness of the house. \u201cWait until I fuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin groans as his head drops to Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, heat already pooling in his belly. Jungkook holds him tight, fingers gripping him by the thighs as he carries Jimin toward the stairs. Jimin finds his attention diverted to sucking hickies against Jungkook\u2019s neck, eager to return all the marks Jungkook\u2019s littered all over him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Jimin exclaim, startling with a realization.\u201dNamjoon \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung\u2019s in the basement. He won\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d Jungkook whispers into his ear, forcing Jimin to squirm away. He glares as Jungkook laughs, a kiss pressed to his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He flushes at that, refusing to let Jungkook distract him. \u201cWhat if your parents \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not coming home for another week,\u201d Jungkook says, ignoring all of Jimin\u2019s panic. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even realise they\u2019ve made it up the stairs, Jungkook carrying Jimin into his room. The light flickers on, Jungkook\u2019s bed neatly made. Jungkook walks them over to his bed, dropping Jimin down onto the mattress. Jimin can feel the heat radiate off of his skin as Jungkook looks at him, his pupils blown with want, eyes dark and hungry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both still wet but neither of them seem to care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways dreamt about this,\u201d Jungkook tells him, knee settling on the bed as he leans down, and Jimin\u2019s breath catches in his throat, feels like a sheep about to be devoured by a wolf. \u201cHaving you spread out on my bed, begging to be fucked, begging for my cock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Jimin asks, letting Jungkook smooth his hands up his torso until they\u2019re pushing his arms up, Jimin\u2019s wrists pinned to the bed where Jungkook holds them down. His biceps flex as he holds him, Jimin\u2019s cock throbbing between his legs, ass clenching around nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDreamt about how tight you\u2019d feel, how your pretty hole would swallow my cock up,\u201d Jungkook continues, rolling his hips down against Jimin\u2019s. He bites his lip, eyes slipping shut as Jungkook\u2019s mouth dips down to his ear. \u201cHow you\u2019d feel clenching around me, how you\u2019d take me, how you were made for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin whines, fingers curling into fists, Jungkook\u2019s hips grinding down harder against him and he\u2019s never hated a pair of shorts more in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Jimin rasps out, \u201cshow me hard you wanna fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got such a pretty little body, kitten,\u201d Jungkook whispers, voice rumbling in Jimin\u2019s ear. His hands drag down to Jimin\u2019s hips, drawing back, and Jimin misses the friction immediately. His eyes fix on the skull tattoo now sitting on the horizon of Jungkook\u2019s shorts, Jungkook\u2019s happy trail peeking out. \u201cYou sure you can take me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me take it,\u201d Jimin challenges, locking eyes with Jungkook. \u201cIf you think I can\u2019t, make me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook swears under his breath, standing up as he looks at Jimin. \u201cYou\u2019re really something else, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He moves to the bedside table, pulling out a bottle of lube. The drawer\u2019s left open as Jungkook chucks his own shorts, leaving him naked for Jimin\u2019s viewing pleasure. He groans at the sight of his cock, mouth already watering and Jungkook smirks, back between Jimin\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pours the lube over his fingers, warming it up as he taps Jimin\u2019s legs to get him to lift them up. It leaves Jimin completely on display, something hot squirming in his belly as Jungkook\u2019s gaze drags over him, hungry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin isn\u2019t expecting him to pour the lube directly over his hole, ass clenching as the cold liquid sends a shiver up his spine. Jungkook pushes one finger in slowly, an eyebrow cocking when he meets little resistance. Jimin\u2019s cheeks colour but he\u2019s not ashamed; after all, he\u2019d come thinking about Jungkook fucking him, three fingers deep inside himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to prep me,\u201d Jimin tells him, legs spreading further apart as Jungkook slips in a second finger next to the first easily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said I\u2019m prepping you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCause I wanna make you come,\u201d Jungkook says, thrusting a third finger into Jimin without warning. The stretch is pleasant, Jungkook\u2019s fingers feeling better than Jimin\u2019s own ever have. \u201cWanna hear you, make you beg,\u201d Jungkook continues, fucking into Jimin\u2019s hole. \u201cWanna feel how tight you get around my fingers when I make you come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I, I already came,\u201d Jimin sighs breathily, Jungkook\u2019s fingers finding his prostate. He rubs at it persistently, electricity running up Jimin\u2019s spine as he gasps, jolting upward on the bed, head falling back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d Jungkook replies, holding Jimin down with a hand on his hip as he pushes a fourth finger in. Jimin takes it because he can, because he likes the burn, mouth hanging open in a silent moan. \u201cWanna make you come again,\u201d Jungkook adds, leaning down to kiss Jimin\u2019s belly, teeth scraping the sensitive skin. \u201cAnd again,\u201d he bites into the flesh, \u201cand again. Want you so fucked out, you can\u2019t even remember your own name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin whines, fingers fisting into his sheets. \u201cS-stop teasing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow am I teasing?\u201d Jungkook asks, fingers rubbing mercilessly against Jimin\u2019s prostate. \u201cYou have to earn it, have to show me how bad you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jungkook</em>.\u201d Jimin\u2019s near tears, little cries muffled when he bites his own lip, hand reaching for his cock. Jungkook swats it away immediately, kissing his teeth in disappointment. \u201cPlease, Jungkookie. Want \u2014 want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant what?\u201d Jungkook asks, unfazed by Jimin\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cW-want,\u201d Jimin starts, teary eyes finding Jungkook\u2019s. \u201cWant you to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I am fucking you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin lets out a frustrated sound, desperation breaking through the last shreds of his pride. \u201cPlease, p-please Jungkook. Want \u2014 want your cock, wanna,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s fingers fuck him harder and Jimin nearly comes, stopped only by the hand Jungkook has wrapped around his cock. He cries, gasping as Jungkook loosens the ring he\u2019s formed around Jimin\u2019s cock, four fingers fucking into Jimin hard. \u201c<em>Oh</em>, Jun \u2014 Jungkook \u2014 ah \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else do you want, Jimin-ah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can barely form the words, teetering on the edge of his orgasm. \u201cWanna feel \u2014 feel you inside. Pl \u2014 Please Jungkookie,\u201d he begs, tears trickling down his cheeks .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a greedy kitten,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, rubbing against Jimin\u2019s prostate without pause. The hand wrapped around Jimin\u2019s cock travels up Jimin\u2019s length, focusing on the cockhead and then Jungkook\u2019s rubbing at his sensitive head as he fucks into Jimin and it\u2019s all <em>too</em> much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJun \u2014 <em>Jun</em> \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hand on his cock is smeared in Jimin\u2019s precum, Jungkook\u2019s hand squelching every time his fingers fuck into Jimin\u2019s hole, pleasure building and building and then Jimin\u2019s arching off the bed, orgasm crashing through him. For a split second, Jimin\u2019s mind goes completely blank, eyes blinking as pleasure courses through him, Jungkook milking Jimin\u2019s cock until he\u2019s going soft in his hold. He whines at the oversensitivity, hissing when Jungkook sucks on the tip of his cock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s mouth licks at the trail of cum that Jimin\u2019s splattered all over himself, his fingers still in Jimin\u2019s hole. He doesn\u2019t fuck into Jimin, just leaves Jimin feeling full, makes it all the way up to Jimin\u2019s mouth, kissing him with Jimin\u2019s own cum still in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bitter taste spills over Jimin\u2019s tongue, his moans devoured by Jungkook as he kisses him, open-mouthed. Cum and spit push back and forth between their mouths until Jungkook is squeezing at Jimin\u2019s neck, Jimin swallowing everything down eagerly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Jungkook praises, sucking on Jimin\u2019s tongue before he\u2019s sitting up. \u201cSo pretty when you come, baby.\u201d He pulls his fingers out of Jimin\u2019s ass, their eyes never leaving each other and Jimin\u2019s already so fucked out but he whines at the loss, already wanting something better to fill him up. \u201cStill want my cock, kitten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any filter Jimin had on his mouth is gone, the words tumbling out in a rush. \u201cPlease Jungkookie, want it \u2014 Wanna feel how big it is, want you to fuck me stupid. Please, please, been \u2014 been thinking about it all month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll month, huh?\u201d Jungkook asks, leaning toward his bedside table again. He rummages through the top drawer, pulling out a condom and Jimin\u2019s frowns at it. \u201cCome on, kitten, tell me all the nasty things you thought about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blushing, Jimin looks back at Jungkook, stares at his pierced nipples and his perfectly sculpted abs, mouth watering. \u201cJust want \u2014 want you to fuck me, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get off thinking about me?\u201d Jungkook asks. Jimin nods his head, licking his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought about how hard you\u2019d fuck me, how \u2014 how b-big you\u2019d feel inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou that hungry for cock, kitten?\u201d Jungkook smirks, tearing the condom open. \u201cGot myself a cockslut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jimin complains, forcing himself to reach up and grab the condom from Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d Jungkook asks, brows furrowed together. \u201cI need to \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wear it,\u201d Jimin insists, already tossing it aside. \u201cCome inside, wanna feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fucking</em> \u2014 \u201d Jungkook has to squeeze his eyes shut before he\u2019s able to look at Jimin again, disbelief and arousal burning in his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought about that, too. Your cum inside me, hot and \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook kisses him so hard their teeth clatter, Jimin\u2019s hands clambering to grab ahold of him. His legs are pushed up, knees to his chest as Jungkook fits between his thighs and Jimin thinks he\u2019s in for more teasing but Jungkook slams into him in one go, knocks the breath right out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like that, baby?\u201d Jungkook groans, grinding into Jimin\u2019s tight heat and Jimin\u2019s incapable of words, mind utterly blank, mouth hung open. He\u2019d thought four fingers were a lot but Jungkook\u2019s cock feels bigger, leaving Jimin so full he\u2019s breathless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you feel so good baby, so fucking tight,\u201d Jungkook growls into his ear, finally pulling back enough to fuck right back into him, his thrust just as hard as the first time. \u201cGonna fuck you so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin only whines, clinging to Jungkook, his face buried in his shoulder. It feels like he can\u2019t get a good enough grip, jostled forward everytime Jungkook thrusts into him, Jimin bent in near half. Jungkook grabs him by the ass, angling his body so he can fuck into Jimin even deeper and it has Jimin seeing stars, body already oversensitive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on baby, tell me how much you like my cock,\u201d Jungkook says, voice rough and gravelly, still bent over Jimin. \u201cYou like how I\u2019m fucking you open?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh \u2014 hic \u2014 Uh-huh,\u201d Jimin answers, feels a little like his mind\u2019s floating off. Jungkook only fucks into him harder, has Jimin clawing at his back, arching off the bed as his cock rubs against his prostate. Jimin\u2019s not even sure how he\u2019s gotten hard again, but his cock is trapped between their abdomens, leaking precum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna take it, aren\u2019t you? My fucking slut,\u201d Jungkook bites out, the words burning through Jimin because he did love taking it, loved being used like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin squeezes around Jungkook\u2019s cock, enjoys the way Jungkook\u2019s hips stutter, and he slows down, fucks into Jimin slower, dragging his length back in and out. It drives Jimin mad, the burn of pleasure ebbing away. He bites into Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, sucking against the mark before Jungkook\u2019s sitting up, wet hair looking even wetter from sweat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s lucid enough to take in how fucking hot he looks, the way his skin glistens, cheeks flushed. He can\u2019t stop staring at the shine of his nose stud or the bars that pierce through his nipples. Just looking at Jungkook makes Jimin want to squirm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Jungkook breathes, grinding into Jimin\u2019s heat. \u201cFucking made to be fucked, aren\u2019t you kitten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Jimin hums, eyes half-lidded as he nods. \u201cL-love getting fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a greedy little slut,\u201d Jungkook accuses, eyes narrowed, \u201cswallowing my cock up. Bet you couldn\u2019t live without it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s voice stutters out of him, eyes wet with tears once again. \u201cAh \u2014 love, love your cock, Jungkookie. Feels \u2014 feels so good. S-so full.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook picks up the pace after that, fucking into Jimin sharp and fast, Jimin\u2019s moans falling out of him in sync with the sound of Jungkook\u2019s balls slapping his ass, the obscene squelch of his cock pushing into Jimin turning him on even more. \u201cAh, ah, ah!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure when Jungkook leans forward again, mouth seeking his as they kiss. Jungkook\u2019s palms slide over the length of his arms, finding Jimin\u2019s hands. Their fingers lace together, Jimin\u2019s legs wrapped around Jungkook\u2019s waist as he pounds into him. The bed smacks against the wall on a particularly hard thrust, Jimin\u2019s eyes rolling into the back of his head as he gets fucked, moaning out loudly as his cock drools precum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJun \u2014 Jungkookie,\u201d he slurs, whining pathetically, their tongues brushing against each other. It's not even a kiss anymore, just the two of them sharing the same breath, Jungkook groaning with every thrust forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking made to take cock, kitten,\u201d he hisses, leaves open mouthed kisses along Jimin's jaw. \u201cSo fucking good for me, feels \u2014 feels so good being inside you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant you \u2014 Want you to u-use me,\u201d Jimin pants out, eyes squeezing shut as Jungkook pulls back up, his hands back on Jimin's hips. His cock slips out of Jimin as he adjusts them, gets Jimin's legs wrapped around himself as he pushes back in. Jimin sighs, happy to be full again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a good slut, offering yourself up,\u201d Jungkook smirks, hands firmly wrapped around Jimin\u2019s waist as he drills into him. And Jimin isn\u2019t going to last, can\u2019t hold it off, cock bouncing as Jungkook hammers into his abused hole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna \u2014 gonna c-come,\u201d Jimin cries out, pleasure building higher and higher and Jungkook just keeps fucking him, the pace of his thrusts brutal, too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on then, kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin sobs as he comes, bodily arching off the bed, head tossed back. His balls tighten up as he spills a pathetic dribble of cum over himself, ass clenching around Jungkook so tight, Jungkook\u2019s thrusts halt momentarily as he swears out loud. Jimin forgets where he is, body curled upwards, hands fisted in the bedsheets and still, Jungkook fucks him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit shit shit.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s gripping Jimin so tight, he knows he\u2019ll have bruises to show for it, relishing the thought. He\u2019s fucked right through his orgasm, Jungkook\u2019s last few thrusts erratic as he slams into Jimin, the oversensitivity leaving Jimin crying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, come inside, Kookie,\u201d Jimin manages, words barely coming out. \u201cWant your cu \u2014 <em>oh!</em>\u201d He has to catch his breath, body still strung up as Jungkook thrusts in one last time, grinding into him and then he feels it, hot cum spilling inside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin groans in tandem with Jungkook as he falls forward, hips twitching as he fucks himself through his orgasm, cock throbbing inside Jimin. He rocks his body forward gently, cum filling Jimin up and he wishes he could keep it there forever, arms wrapping around Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The touch has Jungkook falling forward, his weight slumping on top of Jimin as he grunts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans, mouth finding Jimin\u2019s neck, kissing him as he lies there, fucked out. \u201cWow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs, happy to have made Jungkook feel so good but he\u2019s just as tired, eyes already feeling heavy and Jungkook\u2019s weight starting to feel heavier and heavier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWish I could be inside you forever,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, still resting on top of Jimin, and Jimin makes a hum of agreement, still too fucked out to make any sense. He doesn\u2019t want Jungkook to pull out either, grunting as Jungkook shifts, kissing Jimin\u2019s neck again as he gets up. Jimin can barely keep his eyes open as he watches Jungkook sit up between his legs, fingers brushing against his rim as he looks down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finally pulls out, slow enough that Jimin can feel every inch drag out of him. His ass clenches around nothing, legs falling down onto the bed and he misses the feeling of fullness, mouth twisted into a pout as he whines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Jungkook breathes, \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stop</em>.\u201d Jimin hides his face by turning onto his side in an attempt to hide his face in the pillow, suddenly shy under Jungkook\u2019s gaze. He hates how his heart races at the compliment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m only telling you the truth.\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t wait for Jimin to respond, leaning down to pull him into a chaste kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta get my kitten cleaned up,\u201d Jungkook smiles, rolling off the bed. Jimin watches him leave, curling into a ball on Jungkook\u2019s bed as he waits for him. It hits him then, that they\u2019d just fucked on Jungkook\u2019s childhood bed. Jimin\u2019s face flushes at the thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook isn\u2019t gone for long, but Jimin grows impatient anyway, fidgeting and peeking over for his return. He emerges with a damp washcloth and climbs back onto the bed, jostling Jimin as the weight shifts. Jimin stares up at him as he leans in and carefully wipes the cum from his chest and stomach, his touch gentle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn your tummy, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin turns over, embarrassed to be baring his ass for Jungkook despite everything they\u2019ve just done. He can feel the cum oozing out of his ass, knows Jungkook will see it. He feels Jungkook\u2019s hands warm on his ass, spreading his cheeks, and he whimpers, still a little sensitive. He turns his head back so he can look at him and finds Jungkook staring at his hole, washcloth forgotten on the bed beside them, creating a damp spot on the sheets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Jimin whines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt your pretty little hole,\u201d Jungkook answers, thumb rubbing over the abused skin. \u201cIt\u2019s all swollen and puffy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t think he can flush any harder but he does, attempts to bring his legs closer together as he hides his face in the pillow. \u201c<em>Jungkook</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook only hums and then Jimin yelps, feels Jungkook push his thumb into Jimin\u2019s hole followed by something wetter and hotter until it sinks in that Jungkook\u2019s got his tongue inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he hisses, obediently pushing his leg up when Jungkook nudges it, tongue digging in deeper. Jimin can\u2019t believe he\u2019s eating his own cum out of Jimin\u2019s ass but then, he can\u2019t believe a lot of the shit Jungkook can do. He moans when Jungkook pulls back enough to lick over his hole, allowing Jimin to rub his ass back in Jungkook\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An especially loud whine escapes him when he feels Jungkook\u2019s nose drag over his rim as he kisses Jimin\u2019s taint, nudging it back up Jimin\u2019s crack as his mouth returns to Jimin\u2019s hole. He licks it, sucking against it as Jimin moans into his pillow, hardly believing that his cock was getting hard <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jungkook pushes his ass cheeks apart to dig deeper, nose pushing into his ass as his tongue dives further into Jimin\u2019s hole, he jerks upward, overwhelmed by the feeling. Jungkook\u2019s tongue is so soft inside him, his thumb hooking into his rim to spread him open wider. Jimin feels the cum dribble out of him, groaning as Jungkook fucks his tongue into him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ruts against the bed as Jungkook eats him out, a steady back and forth as Jimin meets Jungkook halfway. His cock rubs against Jungkook\u2019s bedsheets, raw and oversensitive but he almost enjoys the edge of pain, how it feels like too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie,\u201d he slurs out, hands fisted in the sheets. Jungkook only hums, squeezing Jimin\u2019s ass so hard it hurts. \u201cJungkookie, ah \u2014 please \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s not even sure if he wants to come but he wants something, feels almost stupid with how overloaded his brain is, body thrumming with pleasure. Jimin thinks he might be drooling, barely registering Jungkook\u2019s finger slipping in as he seems to suck on Jimin\u2019s hole, swallowing down the cum in Jimin\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018S too much,\u201d Jimin cries, words garbled together but Jungkook doesn\u2019t stop, his finger pressing into Jimin\u2019s prostate and it is too much, Jimin arching off the bed as he comes. He\u2019s blindsided, body trembling as his orgasm tears through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a split second, Jimin can\u2019t remember anything, panting into his pillow as the orgasm wracks through him, painful. He comes completely dry, wiped out as he lies there overwhelmed. Jungkook licks at his holes a couple more times before he\u2019s kissing Jimin\u2019s ass, hands squeezing the fat so hard his fingers dig right in. It makes Jimin shiver.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Jimin starts, slowly coming back to, blinking his eyes open. He\u2019s curled up into himself, cock twitching uselessly between his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were supposed to clean me up,\u201d Jimin accuses, but he can\u2019t even muster up the fake annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I did clean you up,\u201d Jungkook grins, his chin a mess of cum and spit. Jimin thinks his cock would spring up at the sight if it had any life left in it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, do you ever stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin rolls his eyes and even that feels like an effort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI always wanted to do that,\u201d Jungkook tells him, absolutely shameless. He grabs the wet cloth to wipe his face clean before finally cleaning Jimin up, touch light as he wipes at Jimin\u2019s sensitive hole and then all the way to his balls. When Jungkook\u2019s done, he manages to roll Jimin onto his back, grinning at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin licks his lips, pawing at him, wanting a kiss, and Jungkook comes readily, licking into Jimin\u2019s willing mouth. He hums into their kiss, Jungkook settling down next to him on the bed, pulling Jimin in by the hip. Somehow, Jungkook manages to get the blanket over the both of them, never breaking away from Jimin once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever,\u201d Jimin says a little breathless as he breaks their kiss to press a palm to Jungkook\u2019s chest. Jungkook\u2019s hand strokes up and down his side, cupping Jimin\u2019s ass when he feels like it. He averts his eyes from Jungkook\u2019s out of embarrassment. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done that before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever eaten your ass out?\u201d Jungkook asks incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re lying, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I lie about that?\u201d Jimin smacks him in the chest, flustered despite how fucked out he feels. Four orgasms may be his limit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve literally been <em>dreaming</em> about eating your ass out since I was like 15 and learned what porn is,\u201d Jungkook exclaims, voice rising in pitch. Then he turns bodily toward Jimin with a determined look. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, I\u2019ll make up for all the missed years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut. <em>Up</em>.\u201d Jimin shrieks, hands coming to cover his face, mortified despite being touched by Jungkook\u2019s earnestness. \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up shut up shut up!\u201d Jimin curls into a ball, head hiding in his arms as Jungkook laughs, tugging him into his arms for cuddles. He ignores how Jungkook smooths a hand over his ass, a kiss pressed to the crown of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being awfully shy for someone who was begging for my cock earlier,\u201d Jungkook teases, yelping and pulling back when Jimin flicks one of his nipple piercings in retaliation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAss,\u201d Jimin scowls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am what I eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin glares at him harder, but Jungkook only grins toothily, leaning in and giving him a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute, kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Jimin grumbles, allowing Jungkook to pull him in closer. He ends up with his head cushioned on Jungkook\u2019s chest, curled up into his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2600</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin wakes up feeling uncomfortably warm, but he doesn\u2019t mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He blinks slowly, fingers wiggling as awareness returns to his body, his eyes sticky and his limbs stiff. His head is still pillowed on Jungkook\u2019s chest, his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist in an almost vise-like grip as if he can\u2019t bear to let Jimin go even in his sleep. Jungkook\u2019s steady breath stirs Jimin\u2019s hair, and their legs are tangled together under the sheets. Jimin sighs, tucking himself closer, eyes drifting shut again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s skin is warm against Jimin\u2019s cheek, and he tilts his head up to press a soft kiss to his collarbone. He almost can\u2019t believe it, that after all that pining he\u2019s here, lying in bed with Jungkook\u2019s arms around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Jungkook stirs, he mumbles something sleepily, and Jimin smiles into his skin. He trails more kisses up his neck, along his jaw, and Jungkook\u2019s arm tightens around his back. Jimin\u2019s pressing a kiss to his cheek when Jungkook turns his head, catching his lips with his and kissing him slow and thorough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbles against Jimin\u2019s mouth, eyes fluttering open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jimin says, nuzzling into his neck, suddenly shy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s fingers thread through his hair, thumb rubbing little circles into his skull. His voice is still throaty from sleep. \u201cDid you rest well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Jimin mutters a little wryly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, you did come four times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI slept like a rock. I probably <em>snored</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook snickers. \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Jimin pulls back to look at him, Jungkook\u2019s eyes soft and warm. \u201cYou\u2019re the best fuck I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The grin that spreads across Jungkook\u2019s face is unbearably smug. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin huffs, even though he\u2019d known what he was bringing upon himself by admitting it. He buries his face back in Jungkook\u2019s chest. \u201cYou already knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe way you were begging for my cock really gave it away \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin shrieks, shoving at him, but Jungkook grabs him before he can scoot away. He yanks him in, laughing into his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you running off to, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go of me, you jerk!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I do, huh?\u201d Jungkook croons, kissing his nose. \u201cI\u2019m only stating facts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jimin huffs, letting Jungkook fuss over him, pressing kisses over his face and stroking his sides. \u201cBut really. Thank you for taking such good care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He scoots up to kiss Jungkook\u2019s cheek, and Jungkook smiles into it. \u201cI wanna be the best for you,\u201d he says, and Jimin flushes. He rests his head on the pillow next to Jungkook\u2019s so that they\u2019re facing each other, just a few inches between their noses. Jungkook reaches out to trace his thumb over Jimin\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Jimin murmurs. \u201cWhen you said you\u2019d liked me for a while?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a while?\u201d Jungkook snorts. \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin breathes, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only ever had eyes for you. Didn\u2019t think I was that subtle about it either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me? All you ever did was call me annoying \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you were pretty annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin smacks his shoulder. \u201cI was <em>not</em>. I just wanted to spend time with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and being around you made me want to rip my hair out because all I could think about was how much I wanted to kiss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god. Are you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were basically my gay awakening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin whines, covering his face with his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I really had no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you only started noticing me because I got abs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has a teasing note in his voice, so he can\u2019t be all that serious, but Jimin sobers instantly. He pushes himself up and over so he can press Jungkook into the bed, hovering above him with a frown. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles, brushing Jimin\u2019s hair from his forehead. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really like you, Jungkookie. I always have, I just \u2014 \u201d He pauses, struggling to find the right words. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure where I stood with you. And you were Joonie\u2019s little brother, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jungkook repeats, his voice soft. \u201cI get it. I was kind of afraid you\u2019d just see me as a little brother forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin pours out all the things he can\u2019t find words for into a kiss, cupping Jungkook\u2019s face in his hands. He doesn\u2019t pull back until he\u2019s breathless and even then, he doesn\u2019t let go of Jungkook\u2019s face. \u201cAre we \u2014 you said this wasn\u2019t a hookup. Does that mean \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 that we\u2019re dating? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m hoping for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin breathes, settling down beside him again. He traces the dates on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, smiling to himself. \u201cI want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it\u2019s official.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart feels full to burst. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do long distance; that\u2019s not gonna be easy, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he says easily. \u201cWe can make it work. That\u2019s what Chungha-noona\u2019s thinking about, too, with Sejeong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He winces a little in embarrassment at the reminder of Chungha. \u201cThey\u2019re dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe texted me last night \u2014 she finally scored a date with her. That\u2019s what we were talking about at the party, actually. She was trying to figure out how to approach her.\u201d Jungkook smiles down at him, eyes bright and happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were doing a trade-off,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave her advice on Sejeong-noona and she gave me advice on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin snorts. \u201cWhat kind of advice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His lips curve into a sly grin. \u201cKeep my shirt off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d Jimin shrieks, rising back up to stare at Jungkook incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. And it worked, didn\u2019t it? Every time you were around me you looked like your eyes were about to pop out of your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable!\u201d Jimin shoves at him again, flailing around in mortification. Jungkook\u2019s laughing so hard, the reverberations run through Jimin. \u201cYou were doing that on purpose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes it just happened,\u201d he allows soberly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shifts, pressing Jimin into the bed, hands on his sides. There\u2019s a playful glint in his eyes. \u201cIs that what you really think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it is?\u201d Jimin challenges, and Jungkook\u2019s eyes narrow. He surges in to kiss him and Jimin arches up to meet it, rendered breathless by Jungkook\u2019s vigor. Jungkook, Jimin was learning, kissed just as well as he did everything else. When he pulls away, Jimin\u2019s gasping, back hitting the bed again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Jungkook says, and Jimin shakes his head, flushed red. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Jimin whispers, and Jungkook\u2019s eyes widen and Jimin\u2019s heart stutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Jungkook says, and there\u2019s wonder in his words and in the way he\u2019s looking down at Jimin. His fingers touch Jimin\u2019s cheek delicately, like he\u2019s something precious. When he speaks, it\u2019s with awe in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the prettiest boy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin blushes like a tomato and pushes him away. \u201cShut up, you\u2019re so cheesy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that like you didn\u2019t just blush all the way to your nipples.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jungkook</em> \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock on the door. \u201cYah, Jungkook-ah, you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Namjoon. Jimin and Jungkook exchange a wide-eyed glance. \u201cFuck,\u201d Jimin breathes. \u201cNow we gotta tell hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
}
