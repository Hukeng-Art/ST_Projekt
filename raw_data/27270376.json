  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was somebody knocking on the door.\u00a0 The whole point of getting a shitty apartment in run-down building in a moldy corner of Crime Alley was so that no one would bother him, and here he was, in broad daylight, listening to three tentative raps on his front door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looked down at the gun he\u2019d just started disassembling, and slotted the pieces back into place before rising from his couch.\u00a0 It was late afternoon, but Gotham was Gotham, and Crime Alley was Crime Alley and Jason knew too much about the dark corners of the world to assume that his visitor was a friendly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he peered through the peephole and saw a kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason double-checked the gun before he unlocked the door and leaned against the doorframe, using his height to loom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teenager, gangly and fidgeting from foot to foot.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t be older than sixteen.\u00a0 Black hair.\u00a0 Blue eyes.\u00a0 Looked faintly familiar.\u00a0 The kid had widened his eyes when he met Jason\u2019s gaze, but now he was staring at floor and chewing on his lip.\u00a0 He had a cloth bag in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jason said, flat and rough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid darted another look at him before he thrust the bag out.\u00a0 Jason resisted the automatic urge to take what was handed to him, and arched an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cFor you,\u201d the kid squeaked, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, I <em>did</em>, but\u2014it wasn\u2019t supposed to be\u2014it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looked at the bag\u2014he could see the edges of folds, fabric of some sort\u2014and back at the kid.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid was slowly turning red.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u00a0 I came to\u2014to give it back.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t take it\u2014well, I didn\u2019t take this one, it\u2019s yours, I had a different\u2014that\u2019s not what I\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason took pity on the kid and took the bag from his hands.\u00a0 The fabric was red, and the shade itched at his mind.\u00a0 \u201cBreathe, kid,\u201d Jason ordered, and the kid nearly choked himself complying.\u00a0 \u201cNow, what are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Jason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s fingers tightened on the gun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u00a0 His voice wasn\u2019t shaking, but every other part of him was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid looked up at him\u2014black hair, blue eyes, <em>fuck\u2014</em>and said, quiet but determined, \u201cRobin.\u00a0 It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One part of Jason\u2014the part that howled with fury tainted green\u2014demanded he put a bullet between those eyes <em>right now</em>.\u00a0 Another part of Jason was stunned, frozen in shock.\u00a0 Yet another part registered the fabric of the suit wrapped in the bag, Robin-red.\u00a0 And the final part muddled through the kid\u2019s words until they made sense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason ushered the kid inside before closing and bolting the door shut, because this wasn\u2019t a conversation he wanted to have in the hallway wearing no mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>,\u201d was the first thing he managed to string together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the kid blurted out, definitely trembling now, \u201cI never meant to take your place\u2014I didn\u2019t mean\u2014if I\u2019d known you were still alive\u2014I\u2019m so sorry\u2014I just\u2014I wanted to tell you\u2014Robin\u2019s <em>yours</em>, Jason, and I\u2019m really, really, really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had to holster the gun to slap a hand over the kid\u2019s mouth, and the spluttering died out as the kid froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit,\u201d Jason nudged the kid towards the couch, \u201cAnd <em>breathe</em>.\u201d\u00a0 He got the kid a glass of water before he sank down into the seat opposite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTimothy Drake,\u201d he frowned, studying the kid\u2019s face.\u00a0 Now that he knew what he was looking for, the angles were familiar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid nodded, shoulders hunched and hands wrapped around the glass as he stared at Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason turned his attention back to the bag, drawing out the uniform\u2014<em>his</em> uniform, the one he hadn\u2019t taken to Ethiopia, the red-and-green-and-yellow suit, the black cape, the domino mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d the kid whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never touched, I\u2014I thought you were\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop apologizing,\u201d Jason snapped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid\u2014Timothy\u2014<em>Robin\u2014</em>Replacement\u2014Jason had dreamt of this very scenario.\u00a0 Of ripping the <em>R</em> off the kid\u2019s chest, of taking the place that had been <em>stolen</em> from him, of watching the kid choke on apologies as Jason took out his frustration\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes are glowing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shut them and exhaled shakily.\u00a0 He needed to\u2014he had to calm down.\u00a0 This was not how he saw the afternoon going.\u00a0 He\u2019d just gotten back to Gotham, just started making forays into the gangs running Crime Alley after he failed to detonate the bomb under the Batmobile.\u00a0 After he\u2019d had the idea of forcing Batman to confront the Joker, of making the Replacement pay, of cleaning up Crime Alley from within.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cRobin\u2019s yours.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had never imagined that he could get it all back.\u00a0 Not after he\u2019d been abandoned the last time, left behind and forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it the Lazarus Pit?\u201d the kid asked curiously, \u201cBecause there was a funeral and everything, and I don\u2019t know how Bruce was tricked\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid,\u201d Jason bit out, \u201cShut up.\u201d\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to hear about Bruce.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to hear about his stupid family and his death and everything he\u2019d missed for three years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014oh.\u00a0 Sorry,\u201d the kid winced.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason took a couple of deep breaths\u2014until he no longer had the urge to fit his hands around the kid\u2019s scrawny neck and <em>squeeze\u2014</em>and regarded Tim with an even stare, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo give you back the suit,\u201d Tim said, blinking at him in bemusement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it occur to you that I know exactly where the Manor is, and I could\u2019ve taken it if I wanted it back?\u201d Jason asked, like it had ever occurred to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Home.\u00a0 It was right there.\u00a0 He knew the way.\u00a0 He could just\u2026go back.\u00a0 No one was stopping him.\u00a0 Why did it feel like someone was stopping him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just,\u201d the kid fidgeted, and went back to staring at his hands.\u00a0 \u201cYou were my Robin,\u201d Tim said, in a tone of voice so low Jason barely heard him, \u201cI didn\u2019t want\u2014I thought you might be\u2026upset.\u00a0 And I just wanted\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to feel like\u2014I wasn\u2019t your replacement.\u00a0 I was just a\u2026placeholder.\u00a0 Because\u2014because Batman needed a Robin and I\u2019m so sorry for stepping into your shoes.\u00a0 It was always going to be temporary.\u00a0 I just\u2014I wanted you to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him.\u00a0 <em>\u2018You were my Robin\u2019</em> filled his head on a loop.\u00a0 He\u2019d wanted to hurt this kid.\u00a0 He had planned to break his bones and shoot him and leave him terrified and screaming and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Jason croaked out, in lieu of following that particular train of thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a security camera,\u201d Tim said, \u201cAnd you took off your helmet for a second\u2014you had your mask on, but I\u2014I recognized your face.\u00a0 And then I found you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you found me,\u201d Jason said flatly, \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m good at finding people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured out who Batman and Robin were, all by myself,\u201d the kid said, smiling slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Jason raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was definitely a smirk.\u00a0 \u201cI was nine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason let out a low whistle.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t found out until he\u2019d literally stumbled upon Bruce climbing out of the Cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFinding you was easier,\u201d Tim said, \u201cWith the Batcomputer\u2019s resources.\u00a0 And Oracle, but I didn\u2019t tell her who I was looking for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason squinted at him, \u201cWho\u2019s Oracle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinked, \u201cBarbara?\u00a0 Didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBatgirl?\u201d Jason frowned, \u201cWhy did she change her name?\u00a0 What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim went pale.\u00a0 Not even slightly pale, but full-on sheet-white and Jason tensed, ready to catch the kid and keep him from cracking his skull open if he fainted.\u00a0 \u201cShe got injured,\u201d he said in an airy tone of voice that didn\u2019t match his sudden terror, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him, but didn\u2019t press.\u00a0 He dropped his gaze back to the suit in his lap.\u00a0 His suit.\u00a0 He could have Robin back.\u00a0 He could pretend like the past three years had never happened, like Batman had rescued him, like\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a clown hadn\u2019t ripped him apart so thoroughly that Jason still hadn\u2019t found all the pieces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason slumped back.\u00a0 He could feel the rage draining out of him, the mindless fury and shrieking wrath.\u00a0 The kid had given it back.\u00a0 Robin was his again.\u00a0 Robin was his but he still felt hollow inside, which meant that the problem had never been them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem had been him the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been planning to kill and break and make them all suffer and now, with his old costume back, with his old life so close he could taste it, it was like he\u2019d broken through a fog.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was so angry.\u00a0 He was so <em>furious</em>.\u00a0 At the fifteen-year-old that went running in without backup.\u00a0 At the seventeen-year-old that decided to listen to Talia al Ghul.\u00a0 At the eighteen-year-old that placed a bomb on the Batmobile with every intention of pressing the trigger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What was he <em>doing</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason picked up the domino mask.\u00a0 Plain black.\u00a0 He\u2019d gotten a new one in red, unable to stomach wearing the same mask he\u2019d died in.\u00a0 Or unable to betray a hint of allegiance to the colors he was no longer worthy of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the kid whispered again, \u201cI\u2019m not your replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned the mask around and leaned forward, pressing it to skin and sealing it down.\u00a0 The kid stared at him, frozen to the spot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, forcing the ghost of a smile on his face, \u201cYou\u2019re my successor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid unsealed the mask easily, pulling it off his face and staring at Jason with wide blue eyes, \u201cJason, what\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin is magic, kid,\u201d Jason said, standing up and depositing the bag back in Tim\u2019s lap, \u201cRemember that.\u00a0 Also\u2014stay away from clowns and crowbars.\u201d\u00a0 <em>Until I put a bullet in the fucker\u2019s head</em>, he finished mentally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim flinched at the reminder, but hastily straightened.\u00a0 \u201cJason, I\u2019m not\u2014Robin is yours, I can\u2019t possibly be\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can.\u00a0 You are.\u00a0 Thanks for the offer, baby bird, but I can\u2019t be Robin again.\u201d\u00a0 Jason gestured to the gun, to the apartment, to the red helmet sitting on a table, \u201cNot after this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not with blood on his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Jason, you\u2019ll always be Robin,\u201d Tim stood up, his eyes flashing, \u201cI\u2019m not really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin is light,\u201d Jason said, \u201cThe hope in the darkness.\u00a0 The brightness in Batman\u2019s shadow.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>you\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stepped forward and gripped the kid\u2019s shoulders\u2014Tim went quiet and still, blinking up at him in surprise.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not brightness, or light, or magic,\u201d Jason said softly, trying hard to keep his fingers from tightening, \u201cBefore you showed up at my door, baby bird, I was intending to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid didn\u2019t tear himself away from Jason.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t even flinch.\u00a0 He stared up at him in trusting faith and Jason felt something in his heart burn, ripping away from the green that ensnared everything around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a monster, kid,\u201d Jason said softly, willing him to believe it, \u201cI came back wrong.\u00a0 Someone needs to put the terror back into this city, and Batman\u2019s not up for the job.\u00a0 I can\u2019t be Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s face scrunched up, eyes narrowing and lips thinning, and Jason let go, stepping back with a pang of fond amusement.\u00a0 Self-righteous and stubborn.\u00a0 He would fit right in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Tim said, his expression slipping to something more calculating, \u201cBut then you have to teach me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTeach you what?\u00a0 How to shoot a gun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow to be Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason laughed.\u00a0 \u201cGo to the Golden Boy for that, Timbo,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cYou don\u2019t need lessons from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI already got lessons from Dick,\u201d Tim said, his expression resolute, \u201cBut I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 You said I\u2019m your successor, so I want to learn from <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stopped to stare at the kid, who was watching Jason with a determined glare, crossing his arms and standing his ground.\u00a0 Jason had been in Gotham one week before the kid had found him\u2014he was never going to be able to go to ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason considered just shooting him and dropping him back off at the Cave, and groaned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s face split into a grin, the little shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid stayed to hound him, asking questions so quickly Jason could barely keep up and seemingly unconcerned with Jason\u2019s flare-ups and his eyes pulsing green.\u00a0 By the time it grew dark, Jason was scrambling at an excuse that would allow him to kick the kid out without those blue eyes going wide and teary, and he seized upon the dying light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to head out on patrol soon?\u201d Jason asked a little desperately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim cocked his head towards the window, \u201cUm, no, I came here to give you Robin back, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, but isn\u2019t Batman going to wonder where you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinked at him, \u201cI told Bruce I was quitting before I came here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him.\u00a0 \u201cYou told Batman that you were giving Robin back to me?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrows because he didn\u2019t see that going over well.\u00a0 Batman wouldn\u2019t have left the kid out of his sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, just that I was leaving.\u00a0 I wanted you to be able to tell him on your own,\u201d Tim said, staring at the floor again, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know if you had a reason for keeping it a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t ask for an explanation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I just left a note.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026left a note,\u201d he said, his voice strangled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I told him I was fine and it was okay, I wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone about Batman,\u201d Tim shrugged, still pondering the wood grain like it was a Picasso, \u201cAnd I left my phone behind, so you don\u2019t have to worry that he\u2019ll track me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason sat down suddenly, his legs wobbling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d Tim said, alarmed, hovering over him, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0 Jason buried his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou left him a note,\u201d Jason said, his voice muffled, \u201cSaying that you were leaving.\u00a0 And you left your phone behind.\u00a0 And then you vanished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t <em>vanish</em>, Jason, what\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to call Bruce,\u201d Jason said, because he wanted Batman to suffer, but this was a little <em>too</em> on the nose, even for him.\u00a0 \u201cBefore he has a heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would he have a heart attack?\u201d Tim asked, confused, \u201cI don\u2019t live at Wayne Manor, Jason, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason made a sharp, inarticulate noise and dug his own phone out, dialing a number he\u2019d been forced to memorize a long time ago.\u00a0 It rang\u2014once, twice, thrice\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWayne residence, this is Alfred speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s throat had closed up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How could he have forgotten Alfred?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The line ended with a <em>click</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d Tim was hovering near him, watching him carefully as his fingers fidgeted with the hem of his hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hit redial and shoved the phone at Tim.\u00a0 \u201cTell Bruce you\u2019re safe,\u201d he ordered, \u201cBefore the man has a breakdown.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gave him a strange look before his protests were cut off by the call connecting.\u00a0 \u201cHi, Alfred,\u201d he said, biting his lip again, \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine\u2014hi, Bruce\u2014I\u2019m fine\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m with J\u2014\u201d Jason made a sharp, slicing motion.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m with no one!\u201d\u00a0 Jason rolled his eyes at the less-than-stellar save.\u00a0 \u201cI borrowed a phone from someone to call.\u00a0 Uh-huh.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I\u2019m <em>fine</em>.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Bye, Bruce.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim ended the call and gave the phone back to him, exasperated.\u00a0 \u201cHappy now?\u201d the kid groused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEcstatic,\u201d Jason said, turning to head towards the kitchen, \u201cNow scram, kid.\u00a0 You\u2019ve been here for hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> may not have patrol, but I certainly do, and I\u2019m not letting you stay in my safehouse unsupervised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much of a safehouse,\u201d the kid grumbled, \u201cSeeing as I found it in two days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stalker, baby bird,\u201d Jason raised his eyebrows in reproach, \u201cAnd shoo.\u00a0 Go back to your nest.\u00a0 Tell Bruce it was a mistake and you\u2019re going to be Robin again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim fidgeted, his gaze dropping back to the floor.\u00a0 Jason followed his stare, unsure of what could keep the kid\u2019s attention there.\u00a0 \u201cAre you sure?\u201d the kid asked in a small voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The green swelled, but it wasn\u2019t aimed at the kid and the familiar hiss of fury was almost\u2026warm.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sure, baby bird,\u201d Jason said, dropping his tone to something gentler, \u201cYou deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim looked up, his eyes impossibly wide, and somehow\u2014between one breath and the next\u2014Jason\u2019s ribs were being constricted by a deceptively tight grip.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive,\u201d the kid breathed out, his voice hoarse, and Jason slowly curled his arms around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too?\u201d Jason tried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim choked on a chuckle, and squeezed harder.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my Robin,\u201d he said, his voice barely audible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason felt his heart clench.\u00a0 \u201cWell, then you\u2019ll always be mine,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce wandered down to the Cave, expecting to see Tim already ready to go out.\u00a0 The kid hadn\u2019t lost one bit of the enthusiasm that had made him hunt down Batman in the first place, and it made something in Bruce\u2019s heart ache every time he saw it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He passed by a glass case and a torn uniform and forced himself to look at it.\u00a0 <em>A good soldier</em>.\u00a0 He had to remember.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t fail again.\u00a0 It would break him completely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wasn\u2019t anywhere in the Cave.\u00a0 Bemused, Bruce headed over to the Batcomputer\u2014perhaps he was running late?\u00a0 Or maybe he was sick, he should ask Alfred if Tim had left a message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a note sitting next to the Batcomputer, a ruled piece of paper folded sideways.\u00a0 Bruce picked it up and unfolded it, absently noting Tim\u2019s handwriting before the contents of the note registered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Bruce.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t be Robin anymore.\u00a0 Thank you for everything.\u00a0 I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone about Batman. \u2014Tim.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce didn\u2019t realize he was falling until he sank into the chair, the note fluttering in his shaking hands.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Not again.\u00a0 <em>Not again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulled up the tracking system on the Batcomputer\u2014all the trackers for the Robin suit were still in the Cave, the tracker for Tim\u2019s phone showed him at his house.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 He was still in Gotham.\u00a0 Bruce hadn\u2019t failed yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ran out of the house in a rush, choosing the first car he laid eyes on to make the short drive over to Drake property, dialing Tim\u2019s number as he went.\u00a0 It rang and rang and rang\u2014and clicked to voicemail.\u00a0 Another time.\u00a0 Same result.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce barely managed to turn the car off before he jumped out\u2014he rang the doorbell, he pounded on the door, he called for Tim.\u00a0 No answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dread was sinking into his gut, cold and terrible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce picked the lock and made his way inside, calling Tim\u2019s phone for a third time.\u00a0 A faint sound of music accompanied the call and Bruce made his way through the house, following the sound\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And saw a phone vibrating on a desk right before the call cut to voicemail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim?\u201d Bruce called out, his voice hoarse.\u00a0 There was no response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Not again</em>, his mind screamed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Too late</em>, another part hissed, <em>always too late</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce swallowed.\u00a0 He needed to tell Alfred.\u00a0 He needed to call Dick.\u00a0 They needed to find Tim before\u2014before his nightmare came back to life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Bruce,\u201d Alfred said, his voice wavering, \u201cThe phone\u2014it\u2019s Master Timothy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPatch him through,\u201d Bruce said, coming to a halt on the rooftop and turning away from the street, \u201cTrack the call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m fine</em>,\u201d Tim\u2019s voice crackled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hi, Bruce</em>,\u201d he said.\u00a0 No signs of distress, no code words, nothing to indicate that anything was wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Bruce growled, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m fine</em>,\u201d Tim repeated, sounding a bit confused.\u00a0 No environmental noise, so presumably he was inside somewhere.\u00a0 \u201c<em>I didn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m with J\u2014</em>\u201d His voice cut out abruptly, and Bruce felt his stomach plummet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2014I\u2019m with no one</em>,\u201d Tim said unconvincingly.\u00a0 Hostage?\u00a0 Someone was listening in on the call.\u00a0 \u201c<em>I borrowed a phone from someone to call.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you safe?\u201d Bruce asked.\u00a0 They had to keep him on the line until the tracking could pinpoint his location.\u00a0 \u201cAre you in Gotham?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes.\u00a0 I\u2019m </em>fine<em>.</em>\u201d\u00a0 That was Tim\u2019s typical irritation, but Bruce could tell he was hiding something.\u00a0 There was a prickle going down his spine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>J. J\u2014what? Who?\u00a0 Bruce reminded himself that the Joker was in Arkham, locked up where he couldn\u2019t hurt anyone, but the rising terror clawing at his throat didn\u2019t quite let it stick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you when you get home,\u201d Bruce said, keeping his voice level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Okay.\u00a0 Bye, Bruce.</em>\u201d\u00a0 The line cut out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a location,\u201d Alfred said, \u201cIt appears to be in Park Row.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce felt his stomach clench.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Nightwing chimed in with the faint sound of a grapple firing.\u00a0 Bruce took out his own and turned to the part of the city that had taken his parents from him, that had given him a son only to tear it away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would not allow it to take Tim.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thought that the kid would\u2019ve left by now, but he made that wide-eyed pleading expression when Jason had started getting things ready for dinner and Jason had just given up.\u00a0 Tim had taken over cleaning the dishes\u2014so someone <em>had</em> taught him manners, they just hadn\u2019t taught him the concept of <em>\u2018overstaying your welcome\u2019\u2014</em>and Jason went into his room to get changed into his armor and suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was not going to fall for those eyes again, he was going to send the baby bird back to its nest and plan for this sudden rearrangement in his goals.\u00a0 Crime Alley still needed Red Hood to clean its act up, but he didn\u2019t need to go after Robin to do it.\u00a0 In fact, if he could convince Tim to look the other way while he snuck into the Cave for some intelligence\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a thud and a muffled shout.\u00a0 Jason turned the corner of his apartment, helmet in hand, and froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stared at him from the kitchen sink, hands dripping with suds, eyes wide and anxious.\u00a0 The dark patch of shadow next to him swiveled to face Jason, before going equally still.\u00a0 The black-and-blue vigilante easing through the window had frozen mid-step, gaze flickering around the scene.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason curled his hands into fists and exhaled through his nose.\u00a0 \u201cI thought you said they couldn\u2019t track you,\u201d he said, keeping his voice deliberately light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman took a step towards him, but Jason ignored him.\u00a0 This was his apartment, his home, it was supposed to be <em>safe\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Breathe in, breathe out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t think they tracked\u2014\u201d Right.\u00a0 The phone call.\u00a0 Jason should\u2019ve sent the kid packing after that, he <em>knew</em> Bruce would\u2019ve been frantic, it was obvious that he\u2019d tracked the call.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Nightwing asked slowly, slipping fully inside, \u201cB?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman was still staring at him.\u00a0 Jason took a deep breath.\u00a0 \u201cGet out,\u201d he said, and was pleasantly surprised when the words came out level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my apartment.\u201d\u00a0 Technically.\u00a0 But Jason Todd was dead, so everything he owned was prefaced with <em>technically</em>.\u00a0 \u201cAnd you\u2019re trespassing.\u00a0 Get out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing stared at him, stared at Batman, and finally swiveled his gaze to Tim.\u00a0 \u201cTim\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim was invited inside.\u201d\u00a0 And then refused to leave.\u00a0 \u201cYou were not,\u201d Jason said bitingly, \u201cGet.\u00a0 Out<em>.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing turned back towards him.\u00a0 \u201cJason?\u201d he said softly, hands raising, taking a step forward\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stumbled back, his fingers white from how hard he was gripping his helmet.\u00a0 He started to shake\u2014the fog that had once muted his emotions disappeared like it\u2019d never been there, and he couldn\u2019t stand still under the force of Nightwing\u2019s stunned surprise, under the weight of Batman\u2019s heavy stare, he was buckling and they hadn\u2019t even thrown a punch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Leave</em>,\u201d Jason snarled, and winced when his voice cracked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing took another step forward and Jason jerked back, forgetting that there was a wall behind him and painfully cracking his head against the corner.\u00a0 Jason hissed, lurching away from the wall, and then staggered back three steps because Batman was suddenly in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Jason said, no longer trying to keep his voice steady, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014breaking and entering\u2014<em>get out\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle Wing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jason hissed, whirling on him, \u201cDon\u2019t you <em>dare</em> call me that, not after\u2014don\u2019t you fucking dare, <em>Dick</em>, you weren\u2019t there, you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing stumbled back a step like he\u2019d been shot.\u00a0 Batman\u2014Batman eased his cowl off and for the first time in three years, Jason was looking at <em>Bruce</em>, at unfamiliar lines on a familiar face, at narrowed blue-gray eyes and a blank expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay?\u201d\u00a0 And it wasn\u2019t a Batman growl, it was the voice of the man that had tucked him into bed and argued about literature and smiled when Jason cracked a joke\u2014and Jason couldn\u2019t do this, couldn\u2019t be here\u2014the helmet slipped from nerveless fingers as he stumbled back another step, shaking\u2014he had a finger on the trigger of the bomb and he saw Batman and <em>he couldn\u2019t do it\u2014</em>his knees hit the floor, sharp bursts of pain\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it!\u201d\u00a0 A warm body, standing between him and the cape that signified safety, security, home\u2014that signified danger, threat, <em>terror\u2014</em>and Jason clutched at the lifeline he\u2019d been offered.\u00a0 \u201cStop crowding him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>knew</em>?\u00a0 Tim, how long\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple of days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t want you to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason squeezed his eyes shut, burying his face in something soft and warm, the hem of a shirt twisting underneath his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim, it\u2019s not\u2014it can\u2019t be\u2014<em>how</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 The Lazarus Pit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shook his head silently from where it was still hidden in Tim\u2019s shirt, because he\u2019d been alive before acid green had eaten up all his senses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the Lazarus Pit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d Tim said, resolute, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you here.\u00a0 If he wanted to talk to you, he knows where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my <em>son</em>.\u201d\u00a0 And that was the Batman growl, that was too close, that was angry and hurt and Jason had nowhere to run\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A sudden, hushed silence.\u00a0 Jason knew he was breathing too fast and too shallow, but he couldn\u2019t figure out how to stop.\u00a0 The green was far out of reach, anger locked away by fear and shame and the sick curl of disappointment because he\u2019d failed again and Batman didn\u2019t want him and Bruce didn\u2019t want him and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d\u00a0 Quieter, softer, further away.\u00a0 Jason cracked open his eyes and peered out from behind Tim\u2014Bruce was sitting on the floor, staring at him and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those were tears in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce was <em>crying</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2014Dick, he\u2019d taken off his mask\u2014was pressed against the far wall, looking at Jason like a desert traveler looked at an oasis.\u00a0 Hopeful and desperate and terrified.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay,\u201d Bruce said quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re <em>alive</em>.\u201d\u00a0 His voice broke on the words, his hand raising before faltering, like he was trying to reach out to Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m a monster</em>, Jason remembered distinctly, <em>I came back wrong</em>.\u00a0 When Bruce realized that, he would leave.\u00a0 He would turn his back and walk away.\u00a0 And it would hurt all the more for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d Tim said quietly.\u00a0 Dick and Bruce weren\u2019t getting any closer, but they also weren\u2019t leaving.\u00a0 And there was no way a kid, Robin or not, was going to be able to move Batman if he didn\u2019t want to be moved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were stress lines around Bruce\u2019s face.\u00a0 The tension and anxiety\u2014he\u2019d come for Tim, he\u2019d been worried about Tim, he had\u2014why was he staring at <em>Jason</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d Tim twisted in Jason\u2019s grip, until he was crouched on the floor facing him. \u00a0His shoulders blocked out Bruce and Dick, and Jason focused on the kid.\u00a0 \u201cJason, they\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d Tim said softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And how did Tim know that?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey miss you very much,\u201d Tim whispered.\u00a0 Jason leaned forward, until his forehead hit the kid\u2019s collarbone, and exhaled shakily, focusing on the soft heartbeat pulsing under his head.\u00a0 \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014Jason, I know you said\u2014I\u2019m not your replacement.\u00a0 Not for Robin.\u00a0 And certainly not as\u2014not\u2014Jason, you\u2019ll always be a part of the family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a soft, choked sound.\u00a0 \u201cJaybird?\u201d Dick said tremulously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not his son,\u201d Tim said into Jason\u2019s ear, barely audible, \u201cYou are.\u00a0 You always will be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sincerity.\u00a0 Ringing of truth.\u00a0 And there was a wealth of <em>hurt</em> in those words\u2014Jason tightened his grip on the baby bird and raised his gaze.\u00a0 Both Bruce and Dick were watching him, identical heartbroken expressions on their faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe\u2014maybe he could\u2014if he just\u2014maybe they didn\u2019t\u2014maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason raised a single hand and they took the invitation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thought Bruce would be the first one to move, but Dick crashed into them, arms wrapping so tightly that Jason was momentarily unable to breathe.\u00a0 \u201cJason,\u201d Dick breathed out, his voice choked, and Jason didn\u2019t have the time to recover before another set of arms wrapped around them, warm and secure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay-lad,\u201d Bruce rumbled, and Jason finally let the building tears drop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim squirmed in his grasp, apparently intending to extricate himself, but Jason held on tighter, suddenly aware of exactly why Batman had taken one look at the kid swinging a tire iron at him and took him home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby bird,\u201d Jason said softly, not letting go.\u00a0 He was enveloped in family and it felt like home.\u00a0 \u201cLittle brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stopped breathing, but Jason didn\u2019t move and Dick didn\u2019t move and Bruce didn\u2019t move and Tim finally relaxed, inch by inch, his tears dripping into Jason\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the kid said, hoarse and choked, like Jason wasn\u2019t the one supposed to be thanking <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Home.\u00a0 Family.\u00a0 And at least for this moment, nothing else mattered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
