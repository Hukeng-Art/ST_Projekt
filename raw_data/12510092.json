  "summary": "<p>It wasn\u2019t until Harry was six that he felt his hand start to burn and he knew that the Dursleys had lied to him! The unbearable pain was the sign of a soulmate bond forming. Harry grows up imagining everything about his soulmate, who would they be and what kind of person they were. Just who was Draco Malfoy?</p>\n<p>Draco was used to people pitying him because they believe his soulmate is a muggle. He doesn't care what they think. He will love whoever Harry Potter is. First, he just has to find him.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>So, if you are a reader of my other works, then you know that fluff is my thing. I write fluffy pieces and there isn't too much angst in my oneshots. Well, I was challenged by SereneFreakGeek to an Angst Challenge. Which let me tell you, was challenging. It took me nearly three weeks to be able to properly figure out what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>There will come a point in this story where you might want to stop reading, I beg you to continue. I won't ever leave you in too much pain. Just barrel through it. Now, I myself cried three times while writing this. But if you know me, I am a big giant baby. So, it might not even touch you guys.</p>\n<p>Warning- I do not own Harry Potter in any way, shape or form. All rights to the characters are trademarked by J.K. Rowling. The only thing is mine is the way I spin the story. It is for entertainment only and not part of the official story line.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you all enjoyed this!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay, so, tell me, did I do angst justice? haha I tried to end it after the letter but I just COULDN'T. I had to fix it. I just had to!<br>I may write a follow up chapter with Draco's side of it, how he felt growing up and maybe a tiny epilogue? I don't know. Is that something you guys would be interested in? If so, it will just be added to this one.<br>Soulmate stories have always been something that I am a sucker for. Hopefully you have all enjoyed this. I liked writing it. I feel like it put me out of my comfort zone though, since I don't typically do angst but that's alright.<br>See you next time!</p>\n<p>\u2014XxTheDarkLordxX</p>\n<p>Draco's side of things was longer than I thought it would be. Way longer. Oh well, hopefully you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>At some point soon, I will get to work on the final chapter. It will be an epilogue of sorts. </p>\n<p>Dobby and Draco's friendship was the only thing keeping me going during this. I felt so bad for the both of them. But I do like them being friends. </p>\n<p>The events of the war didn't go into much detail and that was intentional. It wasn't the main focus of the story but more of a side note. So, if you were wanting to hear more about the war, sorry. If it helps, it was interesting in my own mind. :P</p>\n<p>Well, hopefully you all enjoyed this. Until next time. </p>\n<p>-XxTheDarkLordxX</p>\n<p>Hello! I am back today to finish this story off! I am soooo excited about this, you don't even know. This was a struggle the past few weeks. I had all these ideas that weren't adding up and not how I planned it. Thank you, Ren, for making my life easier. She talked me through nearly the whole fucking thing and then even looked this over for me. I adore you. You don't even know. </p>\n<p>Now, I do need to explain something before you just dive right in. The back story of how Harry came to be at the Dursleys was something that a lot of you asked me to write. I wanted to do it justice and not just explain. I wanted to show you. Because of this, the first portion you will see in this final chapter is a somewhat prequel. It explains everything before I dive right back into our lovely boys. So don't treat this as you would a normal epilogue, because it's not. It's a lot more than that. </p>\n<p>There is a death in this chapter, but it is a canon death and a minor character. So if that still bothers you, then I wouldn't read it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I don't know if this is anything like you were expecting. There is a lot of stuff that I would like to discuss. </p>\n<p>Regulus. I fell in love with this version of him and wanted to explore his decisions in this universe. To answer any questions I may receive, no one besides Severus, Draco and Harry will know what Regulus did. I find a certain painstaking grief that someone who went through so much trouble for the light was unrecognized. Idk why, but this was something I wanted to explore. </p>\n<p>Also, the reason I had Kreacher living after drinking the poison was a difference in species. His body would be different than that of a wizard and could be resilient to all kinds of things that would harm a wizard. </p>\n<p>If you are wondering why Dumbledore was so keen to believe that Severus was doing it all for Lily, is that I believe he either wasn't aware of Regulus at all outside of the man being Sirius' brother, or he just assumed incorrectly about where Severus' heart was. </p>\n<p>I debated a long time about whether I would show Draco getting out of St. Mungos or not. I decided to leave it this way because it felt more real. It felt more believable than having him have a happy ending that solved everything. He can have a happy ending and still go through what he did. He can still have a happy ending and be inside St. Mungos. I will leave it up to you to see what you will. If you see Draco getting out, then by all means, believe in that. If not, then that is fine too. </p>\n<p>Some of you may wonder why I didn't go into depth about Ron and Hermione, but that was already explained in the first chapter. They lied to Harry because they assumed he was a muggle and didn't think it would be fair to him that he might not ever get to see Draco due to the spells keeping muggles out. They have apologized for this and he will become friends with them. Tentative ones. But it's a start.</p>\n<p>The bonus scenes were something that I had wanted to include but didn't have a proper place for them. So, I still hope you liked them!</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this!</p>\n<p>-XxTheDarkLordxX</p>",

What was it that made him unlovable? That\u2019s what Uncle Vernon said. Even at his ripe old age of four, Harry couldn\u2019t understand <em>why</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a while, he thought it was just the way they were. Maybe they didn\u2019t have any love on the inside to give away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026But that wasn\u2019t true. They loved Dudley. Harry could tell by the way Aunt Petunia would kiss his cousin\u2019s cheek in the morning. Or the way his Uncle would ruffle Dudley\u2019s hair. They loved Dudley but yet they hated Harry. <em>Why</em>? What could he have possibly done?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps he really was unloved? Maybe something really was wrong with him? If they could show love to Dudley, then that meant that Harry was just broken?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until Harry was six that he felt his hand start to burn and he <em>knew</em> that the Dursleys had lied to him! The unbearable pain was the sign of a soulmate bond forming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing that made the pain and the tears worth it, was when Harry looked down and saw the name of the person that was made to love him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Draco Malfoy</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry traced the letters on his tender skin and marveled at the name. He knew that everyone had a soulmate and that this wasn\u2019t technically special\u2026 but to Harry it was. This meant that there really was someone out there that <em>could</em> love him. They might not, Draco could even dislike him. But there was still a <em>chance</em> of love. Maybe they could be friends? Maybe they could be enemies? Maybe they would just be people who pretended to get along? None of that mattered, Harry would take Draco in any way possible. Because somewhere there was someone peering down at their own palm and seeing his name on it, wondering what kind of person Harry was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully, he would live up to the expectation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>\u201cNo nephew of mine is going to be homosexual!\u201d </em>Those words were reverberating inside Harry\u2019s mind as he tried to make himself smaller, even in the privacy of his cupboard. What did it matter if his soulmate was a boy? Didn\u2019t it just show that a boy could love him? Didn\u2019t it just show that love happened in many different ways? Why did it matter if the name was a boy?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Personally, Harry had never even heard of the name Draco before. Did it sound masculine? Wasn\u2019t his Uncle being a little presumptuous?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry closed his eyes and tried so hard to picture what his soulmate would look like. Would they be a boy? Would they be a girl? Would they have long hair? Short hair? Would they have red hair? Black hair? Blonde hair?\u00a0Brown\u00a0hair?\u00a0He didn\u2019t care either way. The beating of his heart just ached for understanding. That\u2019s all he wanted from his soulmate was understanding. If they could look at him and see someone worth taking a chance, then that\u2019s all he could ask for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco,\u201d Harry whispered, tracing the name on his palm softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His entire youth, the Dursleys forced Harry to wear gloves. They didn\u2019t want anyone to see that his soulmate was a boy. Or even someone with such an odd name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At first, it really bothered Harry. His mark wasn\u2019t an inconvenience or a hindrance. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing, nor did it deserve to be hidden away. He was proud of the name on his hand. Proud of whoever Draco Malfoy was as a person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was special. The name on his palm meant everything to Harry. It was something that was just for him. Something to treasure. So, in the end, it was okay to keep it covered. The rest of the world didn\u2019t need to know who his soulmate was. They weren\u2019t the ones who would be there. They weren\u2019t the ones who would love Draco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry found himself caressing his soulmate mark often and usually subconsciously. It was a form of comfort. Every time Uncle Vernon threw him into his cupboard, he would rub the mark and imagine that Draco would take him away from them. Every time Aunt Petunia would send him to bed without dinner, he would peer at the name and wish that Draco was there to comfort him. Every time Dudley and his gang would bully him, he would press his fingers to the words softly and envision Draco coming to help him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco,\u201d Harry whispered, eyes clenched and fingers roaming his hand. He wished that he could find his soulmate He hated the idea of waiting until he was older to search for Draco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soulmates weren\u2019t always something great. Harry saw the stories, read the paper and watched the news. Sometimes, even being a soulmate can\u2019t stop the evil that can lurk in some people. Everyone has a soulmate. Murderers, criminals, thieves and everyone in between has someone that was meant for them. The marks don\u2019t discriminate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 But they also aren\u2019t always fair. Mrs Figg across the street, her soulmate died before she was born. His teacher\u2019s soulmate committed suicide. Some people have more than one soulmate but don\u2019t want to share. Some don\u2019t want a soulmate at all and refuse to acknowledge the marks on their hand. Some choose to just be friends. While others despise their soulmate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would kill Harry if he finally found Draco, only to be turned away. The years spent picturing who his soulmate was couldn\u2019t have been a waste. It couldn\u2019t. What kind of justice would that be? He hoped beyond hope that somewhere Draco was of the same belief as him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please let them want me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em>Harry spent his free time searching any database for a Draco Malfoy. The searches were always fruitless and completely disappointing. He had always assumed that since the name was so unique, that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find. But it was as if Draco didn\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That either meant that Draco wasn\u2019t born yet or he had died already. Harry had been too afraid to search the obituaries for his soulmate. Didn\u2019t want to see the person he dreamed of for years being already gone to the world. That would crush him in ways that he wasn\u2019t prepared for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the time Harry was seventeen, he had searched every possible database, including foreign ones for anyone even resembling Draco\u2019s name. But it came up empty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t the end of the search. That could still mean that Draco could be born at any moment. Harry could wait a few years and continue the search again. But doing nothing in the meantime was not preferable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a glance at the search engine for lost soulmates, Harry knew that he had to know. He just had to know if Draco was still alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another two years before he had searched every single death in the last seventy years on all continents.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a single Draco Malfoy in any of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did that mean? Did his soulmate even exist? Was there a Draco Malfoy in the world at all? The only conclusion that was left was that they just weren\u2019t born yet. But Harry was already nineteen, that was a big age gap already. Did that mean that he was just supposed to be a friend? Or even a mentor?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry clenched his eyes tightly as he fought the tears that were threatening to come.

His car had finally given up and just died on him. But he felt the urge to walk slow. Felt the need to take things light today. As he looked around the buildings that he usually whizzed past on his commute, he noticed a few odd ones. Some seemed to be there but no one else noticed them.

The wide-eyed look of horror was not something that Harry thought he would be on the receiving end of. Did he do something wrong? It wasn\u2019t like he had been following Ron.

The softness to pink lips, the tingle that went down Harry\u2019s spine, the feeling of Draco\u2019s hand twining his hair, the little breathy sigh they both released before the kiss deepened\u2014all of that was something that his mind couldn't have dreamed up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One kiss turned into two and then three.

Draco heard other kids his age teasing him for being unlovable. That\u2019s what they all told him.

Why should he have to give up a piece of himself to find love? Why should he sacrifice his heart to find success? Why couldn\u2019t they go hand in hand?

Even if Harry didn\u2019t want him as a soulmate, just one look would satisfy him enough to move on. If his soulmate just wanted to be friends, he could do that. It would hurt but he would do anything to keep Harry.

Draco had been through this enough times to know that he was strong enough to withhold from making any noise.

He wasn\u2019t sure how much he could physically take.

Pain and agony. Over and over. A brief respite before he was once again underneath his father\u2019s fury. When his body began jerking both in and out of the spell, he knew that he didn\u2019t have much longer. His body was beginning to fail and he could feel his breath leaving him quicker and quicker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a way to tell time.

If there was even a chance that he could get his father to stop, he would have begged until his voice was hoarse. But he knew that would accomplish nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When it <em>finally</em> seemed like his father was going to stop, Draco opened his eyes to see if someone had come to his rescue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His heart dropped at the sight of his father\u2019s triumphant stare, wand pointed at him and wide smirk adorning his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco closed his eyes and prepared for the spell the best he could. When the excruciating pain once again started back up, he couldn\u2019t hold back the tears. The sounds of the battle around them were becoming harder and harder to hear. He knew that his mind wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He used what little strength he could and took off his glove.

It was becoming harder and harder to make out the letters but he tried to keep the name in his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will not harm young Draco further!\u201d There was a scream as Lucius was blasted backwards before a sickening crunch could be heard on the way down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t tell that he was free of the curse. His body was still jerking and his muscles were trembling hard. He thought he might have recognized Dobby\u2019s voice but it was distorted and distant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cH-Har\u2014\u201d He mourned the loss of not being able to make out Harry\u2019s name before everything went black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was awareness here and there but mainly Draco couldn\u2019t tell whether he was sleeping or not. Sounds were too loud but then too quiet when it mattered. Things were fuzzy and his memory almost nonexistent. The harder he tried to break through it all, the harder it became to stay conscious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was as if he was in a maze with his eyes and ears covered, trying to find his way out. The dead ends were his own mind trying to stop him while each correct turn ended in in three more dead ends. It was utterly frustrating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he got too upset, his mind would scream at him for hours.

He knew that Harry wasn\u2019t going to be one of his healers. If that was the case, he would\u2019ve been able to find him during his searches.

It was a man near his own age, staring at him in a wonder that he had never experienced before. He looked the guy over and noticed that he was wearing Muggle clothing. The person might be a Muggle but that didn\u2019t make sense, considering the wards over the place. Perhaps they were a Muggleborn?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a healer.

He was beautiful in ways that he usually didn\u2019t stop to notice about people. Perhaps boredom was affecting him? The guy had black hair ruffled in a mess that was just as chaotic as his own mind at times. Bright green eyes were shining behind glasses that surprisingly complimented his appearance. His skin was several shades darker than his own. Tanned in a way that he knew was natural.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the guy lifted his hands up in surrender, Draco found himself amused that the guy took him seriously.

No. Was this real? His mind had never conjured illusions before. Nor was he ever this lucid during an episode.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Harry took a step towards him, Draco wasn\u2019t sure his heart could beat any faster.

That was all he could handle. Draco knew it wasn\u2019t proper nor was it normal, but he couldn\u2019t help himself as he lunged for Harry. Being proper was overrated anyways.

He had been dreaming of this moment since he was a toddler. The thought of being stuck in St. Mungos for so long had killed him to know that he couldn\u2019t look for Harry. To have him here, after everything was just too much. He buried his head in Harry\u2019s neck as he croaked out the name that meant everything to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Harry said that he got his letter, Draco snapped his head up in confusion. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t understand that. \u201cWhy would you have gotten\u2026\u201d His eyes narrowed when he remembered that only Weasley had been handed that letter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco almost snorted at the sight of Weasley hiding behind Granger when he glanced towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI want you to know that it\u2019s not silly or insane.

This was everything he had hoped for and more. Draco\u2019s eyes searched Harry\u2019s face, memorizing every little detail. All he had ever wanted was his soulmate to be alive and whole. Anything past that was a wish. But to have Harry tell him that he loved him, was <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco would hate himself if he didn\u2019t move in for a kiss.

He had always imagined what this would feel like but it was different than he thought it would be. Harry\u2019s lips were firm but gentle. Oh, so gentle. He couldn\u2019t help but lift one of his hands to entwine into the thick, messy locks. It was almost grounding in a way. At some point, he might have released a sigh but it was quickly covered up as the kiss deepened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One kiss wasn\u2019t enough.

Such <em>Dark Magic</em>. The kind that shouldn\u2019t be dredged up. A magic that twists the soul and separates the pieces that are needed to remain whole. What kind of depraved individual would create such a thing? Such a lack of empathy and sound reasoning. This was the mark of someone who can\u2019t be redeemed.

Perhaps that was his mother speaking or the silence of his father. But as he looked down at what was obviously a Horcrux, he knew that doing what was right was the only path he could walk down. His own redemption lay forgotten; pushed to the side as a morality he didn\u2019t know existed sprang forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cKreacher, don\u2019t allow me to enter the water and should I pause at any time when drinking this, force it down my throat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the elf didn\u2019t answer him immediately, he turned to reprimand Kreacher but paused at the concern in large eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaster Regulus, Kreacher should drink the liquid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the mounting evidence of a lack of heart, Regulus felt emotions swell up. \u201cKreacher, you are a valuable member of the House of Black. My brother can carry on the family line. My mother needs you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the first drop of liquid that touched his tongue, Regulus knew that it would be harder than he originally thought. Figures the Dark Lord would use a combination of poison, crippling fear, and compulsions for bad memories in one potion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulus clenched the side of the basin tightly as he pulled on every ounce of Occlumency that he could muster. It wasn\u2019t a long-term solution, but it would work for now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three-quarters of the way in and he felt his resolve breaking. \u201cKreacher, prepare to force the issue at hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His hand started to shake, and his heart skipped unhealthy beats. The poison had not only entered his system but was also making itself known. It was a slow acting poison that was no doubt intended to keep the victim alive for questioning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It took several attempts at keeping his hand steady before he was able to swallow the next scoop of liquid. The vile taste had his throat closing and his gag reflex kicking in. Distraction was the only way to disassociate with the reality of what was happening. Regulus thought of his soulmate, imagining the way Severus would glare at him when he braided his hair. Thought of the way his lover could scare children with a simple sneer. Severus was the only one who understood him and the only one who knew him in ways that seemed impossible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He dropped the shell chalice in the basin when the pain became too intense. More cracks in his shields began splintering across his subconscious. A small touch to his lips had them parting. Belatedly, Regulus realized it was Kreacher forcing more liquid into his mouth. He wanted to knock the hand away and retreat into his own mind, but knew that the mission needed to be finished out. The Dark Lord could not continue down this path. The Horcrux needed to be destroyed. It <em>had </em>to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaster Regulus can do this.

A few more swallows and he was able to grab the locket inside. A quick spell was enough to get a replacement version, no matter how fake it looked. That couldn\u2019t be helped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The moment his fingers touched the gold, Regulus had to clench his eyes tightly and attempt to repair his shields enough to repel the Horcrux. The magic surrounding the locket was recent, which let Regulus know that the Dark Lord\u2019s soul had just been splintered. Whether it was the first time or one of several, he did not know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTake me to Severus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Severus tried not to look at the clock, but it wasn\u2019t like Regulus to be so late.

It had been hard calming him down after another episode, but he didn\u2019t mind. He knew that Draco worried about being considered a burden but Harry could never see it like that. The year he had spent mourning Draco\u2019s death was pure hell. The thought of losing his soulmate before ever getting the chance to meet them had been something that killed a piece of his spirit. Despite Draco being alive, that piece never came back. The part that mourned, cried and screamed its grief would never be quite what it used to be. Nothing about their current situation would deter Harry. Nothing would keep him away from Draco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI love you,\u201d Harry whispered, placing a gentle kiss to the top of blond hair. He knew that his boyfriend was asleep, which was honestly one of the only reasons he was able to get away with it. Draco wasn\u2019t the best at handling affection. Although, that was something Harry could understand. Sometimes, never having something can create a disassociation. They were both touch-starved and loved each other, but Harry knew that Draco had a hard time expressing his wants. Not that it bothered Harry, he loved everything about Draco. Even things he couldn\u2019t voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change wasn\u2019t something that came easy to either of them, but Harry was faring well with his new life. Finding out that he had magic had come as a shock, but it paled in comparison to finding Draco. He could live without magic and be just fine. He could even live without Draco, but he didn\u2019t <em>want </em>to. Not when he knew what it was like to have the snarky git in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magic itself was rather confusing. He supposed if he had been brought up to learn it as others had, that it would make more sense, but Harry just found it to be more of a nuisance than anything. Magic tended to make things more difficult. Sure, there were plenty of times where magic was quicker and more efficient, but it was also lazier. Why summon something to him when he could get off his arse and go get it himself? Why use magic to heat up his water when he could just use a kettle on the stove? Wizards were beyond lazy, and Harry just didn\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some areas, he was completely fascinated with magic. The medical advances were astronomical. But he couldn\u2019t help but wish that wizards would find a way to help Muggles in that aspect. It didn\u2019t have to be flashy or break the statue of secrecy, but he just wished they would do <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His own magic was difficult. Different than most wizards but still difficult. Draco had asked the healers to run tests on him and they showed that his aptitude for magic wasn\u2019t as high as a typical wizard, only slightly higher than that of a muggle or a squib. Which wasn\u2019t something he really cared about. He had gone his whole life just fine without magic. The knowledge of its existence wasn\u2019t going to change his viewpoint on life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After finding out more and more about the wizarding world, he had been worried that Draco would grow to dislike his lack of interest in this world, but his worries turned out to be fruitless. Draco didn\u2019t care one iota if he never used magic at all. At the time, the healers in the room appeared to be quite startled by that. It wasn\u2019t until he had learned more about Draco\u2019s family that the statement really solidified it all for him. Draco loving him was a statement in its own right and Harry couldn\u2019t help but melt at everything his boyfriend said on the subject. All of Draco\u2019s pureblood ideals were crumpled into nothing every time they kissed or acknowledged their relationship.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Being with Draco was easy. People tend to think that love is difficult, and it can be depending on the situation. But with Draco? It wasn\u2019t something he had to actively think about. Being with his soulmate came subconsciously; everything inside him moved towards Draco instinctively. They argued at times, especially when Draco was being thick. It usually was always centred around Draco\u2019s recovery. Tearing down walls to safeguard insecurity was difficult. Draco had spent his whole life sectioning himself off from everyone, never allowing anyone inside. It wasn\u2019t as simple as scaling the walls, Harry had to blast through them before he could build them up with proper care and all the love he could possibly possess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t as if it was one-sided. He believed that the only way to really showcase how they would become a unified front would be with the knowledge that they needed to heal <em>together. </em>Just as Draco allowed him inside his walls of internal fortitude, Harry allowed Draco inside. Allowed his soulmate to see the bits that no one else knew existed. There was a certain strength in allowing oneself to be vulnerable in a healthy atmosphere. They may not have started off knowing each other well, but as the months went by, Harry knew without a doubt that Draco was <em>everything </em>to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Draco knew everything about him, knew what made him tick, knew what he detested and even knew his own desires. Which was something that went both ways. Harry could honestly say that he knew Draco better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sound of a chime let Harry know that the healers wouldn\u2019t be around for Draco\u2019s afternoon checkup for another few hours. He could go back to his flat\u2014the one he was dangerously close to being kicked out of\u2014but the thought of leaving Daco didn\u2019t sound too appealing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He knew he wasn\u2019t <em>supposed </em>to get in bed with Draco, but the healers wouldn\u2019t be around for a bit and Harry really wanted to hold him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry had just settled down enough to fall asleep when he heard the door open. He wondered if it was Dobby, but the house-elf wasn\u2019t supposed to visit for a few more days. He wasn\u2019t sure what to think of Dobby. The house-elf was\u2026 odd. But he welcomed any friend of Draco\u2019s with open arms. Anyone that had done as much for Draco as Dobby had, was alright in his books.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whoever they were, they were making a bunch of noise without saying anything. Harry furrowed his brows, trying to remember the spell to make it so that he could talk without Draco hearing him. Harry had been given Draco\u2019s wand to take care of since the healers were still restricting his magic. But Harry couldn\u2019t hold a wand without feeling utterly ridiculous. A stick of wood was supposed to be his conduit? A flimsy breakable stick? Every time Harry touched the wand he felt silly, like a child pretending to be a wizard. He had seen the healers perform magic and even Luna a few times when she stopped by, but it was just odd for him. While alone, in the privacy of his flat or with Draco, he had discovered that he liked to do magic without a wand. It was easier to pick up his own method than to learn the proper way. Magic wasn\u2019t something he used often at all. But when he did, it was far easier to pull it from within than to expend it outwards with a stupid wand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry pulled his magic to him as he cast a silencing charm. At least, he <em>hoped </em>he did. Magic was still a guessing game for him. Only when the newcomers began talking loudly, and Draco was still sleeping, did he relax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhoa,\u201d one of the visitors whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t think healers are allowed to sleep with their patients.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like a healer to me,\u201d a second voice argued. Both voices were male and somewhat grating as they argued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf either of you wake up Draco I will personally disembowel you,\u201d Harry threatened, not bothering to roll over and see who he was talking to. \u201cI\u2019ll do it without magic too.\u201d They didn\u2019t need to know that he had cast a silencing charm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFucking hell!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry snorted at the horror in the first visitor\u2019s tone. He groaned before rolling over and standing up. He blinked at them, but they were a blurry blob without his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As soon as he could see, he held out his hand politely. \u201cHello, I am\u2014\u201d Harry trailed off when he noticed the way they stared at him with a flabbergasted but also painfilled expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry cocked his head to the side, looking at them closely. They seemed to be peering at him as if he should know them. They were both older, late thirties to early forties. One had long black hair that was a little unkempt, laugh lines and a kind face; but his eyes told a different story. His eyes were clouded with something else, something that was a little haunting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The man next to him had light brown hair but several scars adorning his body, including his face. He seemed kind, but also tired. Harry could tell they were soulmates without having to see their marks. It was the way they leaned into each other and mirrored the other\u2019s stance. There was an understanding that screamed soulmate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry?\u201d They both whispered, voices cracking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was an awkward silence as Harry nodded and took a step away from them. He had no idea who they were, and their stares were beginning to creep him out. Stranger danger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow do you know me? I'm positive I have never seen you before.\u201d He narrowed his eyes when they both seemed to deflate, as if he had somehow wounded them. It would seem they were creepy <em>and </em>emotional.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe knew your parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry felt the breath leave him in a painful choke. He had always wanted to know more about his parents, but the Dursleys refused to tell him anything but falsehoods. Their explanation of a car crash was a lie, he had always known that. Car crashes were generally reported and there was <em>always </em>a trail. Only, there wasn\u2019t a single whisper anywhere when it came to his parents. He had known that they wouldn\u2019t elaborate, but the mystery of his parents had always left a sizable hole inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe thought you died with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The more they spoke, the more Harry wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know more. There was grief on their faces and in their tone. He wasn\u2019t sure he could handle it. The thought of leaving entered his mind, but he couldn\u2019t do that. Not with Draco still sleeping. That wouldn\u2019t be fair. He took another step back until his knees hit the bed. He wished he wasn\u2019t on the same side as them. Retreating was becoming difficult.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just when he was going to panic further, a hoarse whisper caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry spun around to look at Draco, who was sitting up with a worried expression on his face. All it took was for pale arms to spread in an invitation before he launched himself at his boyfriend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco tightened his hold on Harry and ran his fingers through messy locks. The sound of Harry\u2019s quick intake of breath worried him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Harry trailed off, hiding his face in Draco\u2019s neck. He wasn\u2019t sure how to voice it. No one knew about his parents. At least no one until now. The Dursleys treated his parents as a taboo topic and would become angry if they were brought up. He had gone so long keeping them as a secret that he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle unearthing it all. Especially with people that <em>knew </em>them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know,\u201d whispered Draco. Harry had told him the very little that was known about his parents and Draco knew that had been difficult. How could it not?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The understanding in Draco\u2019s voice had Harry relaxing into the hold. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be comforting me. It should be the other way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco pressed a kiss to the top of Harry\u2019s head. \u201cSays who? We are here for each other, Harry.\u201d Besides, he was getting sick of needing to be comforted. Draco couldn\u2019t wait to get out of this bloody place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A smile pressed into his neck had Draco smiling softly. \u201cJust let me hold you.\u201d he whispered, hoping his voice wouldn\u2019t carry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry nodded the best he could with his head where it was. A sudden thought had him pulling slightly away. \u201cDid I wake you? I thought I placed the silencing charm correctly.\u201d He ignored the guests in the room, not caring about them at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou did,\u201d Draco told him in amusement. \u201cOnly, you put it around the room and not just around you. So I was included inside the charm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way Harry deflated had Draco shaking his head. \u201cBut it was still a good spell. You successfully pulled it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The praise was nice, but Harry was bummed that it hadn\u2019t gone as he thought it would. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d He cupped Draco\u2019s cheek as he ran his thumb along the purple marks underneath silver eyes. \u201cYou needed the sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can sleep at any point in the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t entirely true\u2014something they both knew\u2014but Draco didn\u2019t feel like elaborating. Sometimes, his mind couldn\u2019t help but relapse and sleep wasn\u2019t up to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was guilt on Harry\u2019s face and Draco wasn\u2019t having any of it. Distraction was the only thing that would work on Harry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry felt a grin form on his face despite himself. \u201cI love you too.\u201d He wanted to tease Draco for being a sap, but now was not the time. He would wait until they were alone to do that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d An exasperated tone pulled their attention elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco gazed at Sirius as he lifted a brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever had a hug before, but this is what it looks like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry snorted when the man let out a heavy sigh. He ignored the question and moved until he could stare at the two visitors. \u201cHow is it you knew my parents? And why did you think I was dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two men shared a long look before one of them cleared their throats. \u201cMy name is Remus Lupin, and this is Sirius Black. We were friends with your parents at school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The statement had Draco jerking a little, tightening his hold on Harry. \u201cHogwarts? Harry\u2019s parents were wizards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Remus nodded his head slowly Harry looked to Sirius, who hadn\u2019t said anything. There was a certain longing in his eyes that felt weird to him. He wasn\u2019t sure what their relationship with his parents was, but he was beginning to think it was a close friendship and not just acquaintances.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe were best friends since our first year,\u201d Sirius whispered. \u201cYour father was the best man I had ever known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry turned his head back to Draco\u2019s neck, not sure he could meet the Sirius' eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t one for rules and I can\u2019t say we were either.\u201d There was a slight chuckle from Remus, and Harry just <em>knew </em>there was a story there. Probably many. \u201cDespite that, he valued morality and stood up for injustice. I won\u2019t lie and say that he was perfect or there were never mistakes, but James Potter was a brave man and loved you <em>so </em>much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry clenched his eyes tightly, wishing just once that his own father could tell him that. Wishing that it wasn\u2019t secondhand knowledge. \u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco watched Remus smile and he furrowed his brows. Why didn\u2019t they tell him about any of this when they found out about Harry being his soulmate? Sure, the battle happened so suddenly afterward, but it\u2019s been <em>years </em>since then. He had been stuck inside St. Mungos for over two years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLily,\u201d Remus began, voice soft. \u201cShe was very opinionated about life in general. If something wasn\u2019t up to her standards, then she changed it. Changed herself or the situation in general. Lily was a fierce protector of others and couldn\u2019t stand bullying or any kind of injustice. She was brave, beyond daring, and held so much courage. Lily wasn\u2019t one to sit back and let others pave her path. Which is why in the beginning, James and she didn\u2019t see eye to eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That had Harry arching his brows. It wasn\u2019t really surprising; some soulmates don\u2019t get along.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sirius let out a barking laugh and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sound. It was obvious that he was someone that saw the joys in life. \u201cShe always told James that it didn\u2019t matter if they were soulmates or not. There were parts of his personality that she herself couldn\u2019t agree with. Lily thought he was too brash, too much of a rule-breaker and just a git in general. It wasn\u2019t until their seventh year that James mellowed out and she really took notice of who he was as a person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey loved each other?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something Harry needed an answer to, but it was something that he had always wondered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery much.\u201d Both Sirius and Remus answered in unison. \u201cYou were their whole world.

Part of him felt like he was hiding inside Draco\u2019s embrace, but at the same time it was comforting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did they die?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVoldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both Harry and Draco jerked.

Wouldn\u2019t that have been announced? How did Harry survive? Was he even there? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The concern and the rush of questions had Harry smiling softly as he ran his fingers along Draco\u2019s nightshirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was public,\u201d argued Remus. \u201cJust not in the way you are thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sirius looked at them both before running a hand over his face. \u201cVoldemort had gotten wind of an impending battle that we were planning. He knew which of the Order were more powerful and aimed to knock them out first. When whispers got back to us that your parents would be some of the ones targeted first, plans were made.

Harry would <em>never </em>actively hurt Draco. Never.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appraising and calculating looks were sent his way, but Harry let them come without looking away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, how about we discuss some happier things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry lifted one hand in the air, gesturing for him to continue. \u201cTell me about the rules my father would break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The delighted laugh Sirius released was the start of many hours of witty comebacks, stories that seemed to be fake, and an endless supply of horrible pranks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Harry listened to Remus and Sirius argue about whether people tend to retain characteristics from their animagus form, he wondered if this is what family felt like. He may not know either of them, but there was still something comforting about it all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sirius may not have been able to be his guardian, but there was still time to get to know him. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sounds alone let Harry know what he was walking into. Despite not being able to see Draco, he knew that Draco wasn\u2019t aware of his surroundings. It happened less frequently than it used to, but still often enough for him to not be released from St. Mungos.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The room was dark, and the candles blown out, but that didn\u2019t matter. He knew that Draco was under the bed. For some reason, Draco felt comfortable down there. The healers said it was a good sign because it showed that there was some cognitive thought process that happened during an episode.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the way he knew Draco felt about the episodes, Harry didn\u2019t mind being there for them. In fact, he wished he was around for more of them. If there was a single second of comfort that he could provide then Harry wanted to be there to give it. There would always be times when he wished Draco didn\u2019t have to go through this, but he didn\u2019t resent the episodes themselves. They were a part of Draco and Harry loved him, truly loved him, and would never belittle any aspect to him. If only Draco could <em>see</em> that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Harry approached the bed, he placed the food he smuggled in from his part-time job on the bedside table. Draco complained that the food here was atrocious, something Harry had to agree with. Whoever was in charge of the food clearly never taste-tested it beforehand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A slight whimpering noise came from under the bed and it had Harry\u2019s heart clenching as he pulled the duvet up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco was rocking back and forth, arms tightly wound around his knees and little breaths of mumbled words coming out. Silver eyes were open but vacant, not gazing at anything and not taking in any surroundings. As Harry crawled on his knees to get to him, he was rather thankful for the new healer. The bed itself had been charmed to allow the space underneath to be bigger than it appeared; something that had been done to make it more comfortable for Draco.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry had learned the hard way that touch wasn\u2019t always welcome. The first time he had tried to hug Draco during an episode, he had been on the receiving of violent flailing that resulted in a hard punch to the face. Luckily, the healers had him healed before Draco had seen the damage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The words coming out of Draco\u2019s mouth weren\u2019t exactly audible. Harry wasn\u2019t sure what Draco was saying or if they were words at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As he got closer to Draco, Harry began whispering to him. It was mostly just soft cooing and the gentle uttering of his name. There was no sign that Harry's words were being received at all, but it established a small rapport. That way it could potentially be heard by Draco whether there was an outward response or not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry reached out his hand and tentatively placed it on Draco\u2019s shoulder. When it wasn\u2019t shrugged off, he knew that it was okay to hold him. As he wrapped his arms around Draco and held on loosely, there still was no reaction. But that was alright; a reaction wasn\u2019t needed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Time passed, but it was more of an afterthought. Harry couldn't care less how late it was or how tired he may be. Making sure Draco was okay would <em>always </em>be his priority.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until a hand reached out and clung to Harry\u2019s shirt that he knew Draco was back with him. He waited patiently for Draco to come to terms with it before he spoke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco hated the way his mind tried working in overdrive. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t place where he had gone when his mind checked out. Sometimes, things would linger and give him a general idea, but not often.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d Draco whispered, laying his head on Harry\u2019s shoulder. The last thing he could remember was complaining about the food and\u00a0Harry assuring him he would help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question had Harry looking at his watch. \u201cI don\u2019t know when it began, but since I have been here it\u2019s been close to two hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two hours were shorter than Draco had assumed. He had been worried it would be another day completely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry closed his eyes at the gratitude, wishing Draco wouldn\u2019t do that. Being here wasn\u2019t something admirable nor was it necessary to be thanked. All he was doing was being a supportive boyfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d Harry tried to keep the chiding out of his tone, but he knew that Draco would pick up on it anyways\u2014he always did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco smiled softly, burrowing into Harry more comfortably. He knew that he didn\u2019t <em>need </em>to thank him, but that wasn\u2019t the point. There weren\u2019t many people that would be willing to stick with him during an episode. Hell, the healers didn\u2019t even do that. They just monitored his vitals and made sure that there was nothing he could harm himself with. It meant a lot to Draco that Harry was there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know,\u201d whispered Draco, closing his eyes and allowing himself to relax fully. He wasn\u2019t tired, but he did need a few minutes to really come back to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll always be here with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know.\u201d And he did. Draco knew that without a doubt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI love you.\u201d Harry paused, narrowing his eyes. \u201cIf you say I know, I will hurt you. I don\u2019t have the right complexion to be the Leia of this relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco lifted his head up, eyebrows furrowing so intently that it scrunched up his nose-something Harry had to try hard at not finding utterly adorable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLeia? Is this another Muggle thing?

That <em>is </em>my speciality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the sparkling shine in Harry\u2019s eyes, Draco knew he was about to regret his words. It wasn\u2019t until fingers began mercilessly tickling him that he knew Harry was secretly the devil.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOi!\u201d Draco cried out as he attempted to dodge quick fingers. \u201cH-Harry,\u201d he panted lightly, trying not to laugh as those fingers dug into the side of his ribs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry only paused to kiss Draco quickly before continuing with his tirade. He would have continued until Draco admitted defeat, but the door of the room opened with a clang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou two aren\u2019t having sex again, are you?

She tended to roll her eyes at them constantly, but he suspected she was warming up to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t having sex,\u201d Harry called out, smirking when Draco made a disappointed noise. \u201cWe are duelling to the death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, far less paperwork.

He made a noise of surprise when Draco shook off his hold and wound slim arms around his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe <em>could </em>be having sex,\u201d Draco muttered, loving the red flush to Harry\u2019s cheeks. \u201cWho cares if we make more paperwork for Emily.\u201d The woman liked to stay busy anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It took a slow roll of Draco\u2019s hips before Harry conceded that maybe he had a point. What was a little extra paperwork? It wasn\u2019t as if <em>they </em>had to do it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The laughter was soon replaced with moans and this time when Emily entered the room, they didn\u2019t say anything. But her frustrated slam of the door was enough to let them know she understood what was happening anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Harry entered St. Mungos, he smiled at the portraits that he liked to consider a magical security guard. They watched the visitors with keen eyes and heavy suspicion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, Henry.\u201d He waved cheekily as the portrait of a healer from the early 1200s scowled. \u201cHow\u2019s your day going? Catch any nefarious individuals?\u201d He knew the portrait must be bored out of his mind; at least Harry would be if their roles were reversed. He didn\u2019t begrudge him one bit for people watching.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the portrait next to Henry let out a little giggle, Harry smiled softly at the little girl. He had learned that she was the first casualty of Dragon Pox, but her death had led to the discovery of the ingredients that would cure generations to come.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMarletta, are you treating Mister Henry in kind today?\u201d The portrait covered her face with her hands before letting out another giggle, peering up at him through parted fingers. She wasn\u2019t much of a talker, but Harry could read her body language. He waved when he was sure she wasn\u2019t going to answer and made his way toward the Welcome Witch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJeni; my favourite employee, the light of my day and wonderf\u2014\u201d He trailed off when she handed him a long chart. Wizards tend to not leave explicitly written details in patient files. Not that Harry would own up to <em>reading </em>any. It wasn\u2019t until he established a friendship with Jeni that she was able to give him detailed information on each of Draco\u2019s days in regard to his healing and medicine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFlattery gets you nowhere, Harry.\u201d Jeni was the first friendly face in St. Mungos that didn\u2019t treat him with pity. As if having a soulmate who needed to be here for the long haul was something akin to a death sentence. Draco was the best thing in his life and he <em>hated </em>when people treated either of them like they had an incurable disease.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously works on you,\u201d He mumbled just loud enough that he knew she would hear him. The laugh he got in return held just a touch of fondness in it, and that was definitely a win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry\u2019s eyes were still trained on the report and didn\u2019t look up when he could hear footsteps. They didn\u2019t sound too panicked, so it was probably just a visitor instead of an injured patient. That tidbit of knowledge alone spoke volumes of the amount of time he spent here. No wonder he was a few short breaths away from being fired from his actual job.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. How may I be of assistance to you today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe are here to see a patient, Draco Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry snapped his head up, gaining the attention of the visitors. Right away he could tell they were of money. A young man and woman around his own age peered back at him in calculating manners. It was apparent the man didn\u2019t like what he saw if his sneer was anything to go by. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMister Malfoy has a list of visitors that are allowed to be seen. Can you give me your names and I will check the list?\u201d Jeni\u2019s voice was calm and friendly, but she kept stealing glances between the three of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry arched his brows, recognizing the names from a few stories where Draco mentioned them. His boyfriend had mentioned the pair in passing each time, as if they weren\u2019t close despite being classmates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When Jeni tentatively cleared her throat, Harry knew these two weren\u2019t on the list of preapproved visitors. The list had been made up by Draco not too long after Harry had arrived. Reporters from the stupid gossip trash that passed as a newspaper liked to try and find a story. Apparently, Draco switching sides before the final battle was seemed as heroic and charming. Nevermind that there were casualties and people died. All the papers wanted to talk about was his looks. Draco had barred entrance from his room except those he cared for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am afraid that Mister Malfoy would have to be notified before you are allowed entry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Pansy asked, voice becoming sharper. \u201cWe have known Draco since we were children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry arched a brow at the explanation. He thought it was very telling that she hadn\u2019t said they were friends. He could say the same explanation about Dudley, but that didn\u2019t mean he would want his cousin to come see him if he were in the hospital.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Jeni shook her head and started to explain that the rules were in place for a reason, Harry lifted up a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll take them to him.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why they were here, but Harry wasn\u2019t going to find out unless he took them back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jeni bit her lip and eyed Harry curiously. \u201cAre you sure? He might be angry with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProbably,\u201d Harry admitted with a laugh. But Draco always did have a hard time <em>staying </em>mad at him. Something Harry used to his advantage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry turned to the two visitors and ignored their narrowed eyes. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to wait to see if they had listened to him or not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you work here?\u201d Blaise asked, tone attempting to be polite but not quite hitting the mark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question itself wasn\u2019t surprising, but the fact that they were willing to initiate small talk was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish. Getting paid to be here would be a nice change, especially considering I spend 90% of my time here anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Pansy began, voice coloured in confusion. \u201cIf you don\u2019t work here, then why did the Welcome Witch listen to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry grinned, not bothering to turn around and face them. \u201cJeni adores me because I adore Draco.\u201d The woman was a sucker for romance and couldn\u2019t help but coo whenever she saw them interacting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Pansy and Blaise made a startled noise, Harry couldn\u2019t help but snort. Before they could say anything, he paused on the outside of Draco\u2019s door. He pulled his magic to him and enacted a silencing charm. One he <em>knew </em>would work properly this time. Well, he hoped it would. His magic was still a little wonky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry turned around and folded his arms across his chest, eyeing them a little warily. \u201cListen, I know you went to school with Draco and were even in his house, Snakledor, or something like that.\u201d He <em>might </em>not have bothered to remember much about Hogwarts. The intricacies and knowledge of the wizarding world was a bit much to only hear about in stories. He had no visuals or books on the subject.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the way Pansy mouthed, \u2018Snakledor\u2019, Harry figured he had butchered the name. Oh well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t close to him or this wouldn\u2019t be your first visit in over two years.\u201d He watched the way they shared a guilty look. Well, at least that was an improvement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, who your parents are, what your political influence is, or how much money you have. You will <em>not </em>impede on Draco\u2019s progress by dredging up the past or infringing on any of his hospitality. If you are here to belittle or degrade him in any manner of speaking, I will make you wish you had <em>never</em> shown up.\u201d He paused to glare at them, not liking the doubt he could see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco is <em>not </em>the same person that you went to school with. Entering this room will grant you a side of him that he would rather you not see. Draco is one of the strongest people I have ever had the pleasure of coming across and if either of you has nefarious purposes in mind, then leave now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The silence that filled the hallway held a touch of awkward unease, but that was something Harry preferred. If he could make them doubt their intentions, then all the better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe just want to see him,\u201d Pansy whispered at the same time Blaise exploded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho do you think you are? You can\u2019t order us around.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em>Harry arched an unimpressed brow. Years of seeing Dudley and his temper tantrums left him impervious to most outbursts. He chose not to answer as he lowered the silencing charm and entered the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco arched a brow when Harry walked in. \u201cYou defending me\u2014unnecessarily by the way\u2014is insanely sexy.\u201d A warm feeling had settled in his chest at the overheard words. Harry caring about him so passionately was something he never thought he would have. Sure, he had hoped as a child to have his soulmate, but dreams are nothing compared to reality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Harry\u2019s shoulders drooped, he let out a loud laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot again,\u201d Harry murmured, not understanding how the silencing charm could have failed. He could have <em>sworn </em>that he had done everything right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome here.\u201d Draco held out his hand and waited patiently for him to approach the bed. He pulled Harry to his lap and held on tightly. \u201cThe halls can only be charmed by the staff. It\u2019s to prevent families from trying to privately change the healer\u2019s minds about treatments and experimental potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry rested his head on Draco\u2019s shoulder and closed his eyes. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed at being found out. Draco knew how much he cared, it was just that he hadn\u2019t wanted Draco to hear him. In case Pansy and Blaise really were here for other purposes, he wanted to save Draco from the ache.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry began, knowing that he didn\u2019t really need to apologize, but it was the thought that counted. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry lifted his head and smiled softly. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surprisingly, Pansy and Blaise didn\u2019t interrupt them at all. If it wasn\u2019t for their presence in the room, he would have forgotten about them completely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco continued to hold Harry as he looked up. \u201cPansy. Blaise.\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why they were here. The social ramifications would suggest that something had happened. They hadn\u2019t come to check on his well-being, otherwise, it would have been done already. No, they were here for other reasons. Ones he was beginning to suspect would either be trouble or a headache.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe heard about your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That had Draco arching a brow. Sometimes he detested the vague subtext. Couldn\u2019t people just <em>say </em>what was on their minds? The subtle language of the higher class was daunting, and he absolutely hated it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco hadn\u2019t heard a single whisper from his mother. He highly doubted it was their way of rubbing it in that his own mother hadn\u2019t come to visit him in two years. Last he had heard, his mother had attempted to transfer the Malfoy vaults to an offshore account, but the Goblins refused without Draco\u2019s consent. It didn\u2019t matter that his father had disowned him prior to the battle. Goblins consider heritage when dealing with ownership. Without there being another offspring that they could count as heir, the Goblins keep to the family. Which is why Sirius holds the Black family account regardless of being disowned. Draco\u2019s mother was only entitled to her portion of the family fortune.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHeard about her high tolerance for alcohol, or heard about her lack of compassion for anything that didn\u2019t cost hundreds of galleons?\u201d He didn\u2019t bring up his father at all, not caring one bit about the state of him. His father was in Azkaban, waiting for the Wizengamot to decide when he would receive the Dementor\u2019s Kiss.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry furrowed his brows as he listened to the blunt tone. He knew that Draco was serious, but\u2026 that was just sad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has approached my father,\u201d Pansy began, fingers twitching for just a moment. \u201cHe has some sway inside the Ministry now that it has been proven he wasn\u2019t a Death Eater.\u201d Supporter and Death Eater were splitting hairs, but Draco wasn\u2019t going to begrudge her family for managing to stay out of the negative spotlight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A bad feeling was beginning to take root in the pit of Draco\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blaise took over when Draco clenched his fist angrily.\u00a0 \u201cYour mother is planning to petition the Ministry to have you declared legally incompetent to be considered the Malfoy heir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco closed his eyes briefly.

Not that he wouldn\u2019t stand in for Draco. It was the fact that it seemed archaic. A power of attorney had the best interest in mind when it came to their wards. A soulmate <em>did not </em>mean that they were automatically trustworthy. There was so much wrong with that belief. Having a soulmate diddn\u2019t diminish free thought or will. He was with Draco because he <em>wanted </em>to be. Not because of the fact that they were soulmates.

Regardless of this, I am a wizard. But I am more than that too. I won\u2019t degrade my upbringing just to satisfy those who could care less.

It wasn\u2019t even due to his personality or any legitimate reasons. They disliked him on the basis of a lack of worth. God, he hated this. Hated the discrimination and prejudice. <em>Fuck</em> pureblood society.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco smirked when Pansy and Blaise looked at him expectantly. \u201cI know this is a hard concept to grasp since neither of you entered the war or took a stance, but every aspect of society is dependent on all of its parts. The belief that purebloods can function without the rest is laughable and delusional. Muggles and Muggleborns are vital to the future of wizards. Without new blood and more chances for magic to spread, then we will die out.

Part of him had always wanted to check on the results of Regulus\u2019 last day, but he hadn\u2019t ever been able to make himself do it. The ramifications for allowing Dumbledore the knowledge that the child existed had been too high. The headmaster had talked for years about the disappointment in the wake of the unfulfilled prophecy. There hadn\u2019t been a doubt in his mind that if Dumbledore had <em>known </em>about Potter he would have had the child under his thumb in no time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefits that Potter could\u2019ve had by being brought up a wizard were overshadowed in danger. If the Dark Lord had come back and seen that the Potter line hadn\u2019t been eradicated as once believed, the child would have been targeted regardless. Safety is what had determined his lack of attention when it came to Potter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Severus had been worried that the boy would receive a letter to Hogwarts when the time came, but with the belief that the boy was dead, Potter was taken off the list and no one looked at it twice. There was beauty in small miracles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A clang of the door shutting shattered the silence of the hall as Potter looked around the cells near the door. Severus raised his hand towards the guards in a silent command to stay still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLucius is this way, Mister Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He could have introduced himself, but Severus wanted to see how the unorthodox meeting would play out. The family resemblance to James was obvious, but Severus wanted to know more about the child Regulus went through the trouble of saving. Not to mention, he wanted to know what kind of connection Potter would have with a Death Eater.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry took a deep breath, not really paying attention to the guard as he trekked the path to the room where the kiss would take place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His nerves were out of control and Harry wished he had Draco's support, but he hadn\u2019t decided if it was something he would ever mention to Draco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the guard stepped into the room and gestured for Harry to follow, he took a deep breath before doing just that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sight of Lucius Malfoy had Harry\u2019s fists clenching tightly. Lucius wasn\u2019t regal or pristine, not in the way he had seen glimpses in photos. If it wasn\u2019t for the knowledge that this was indeed Lucius, Harry wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the connection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome to gloat?\u201d The question was directed towards the guard, something Harry found odd, but he ignored it completely in favor of stepping forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cold calculating silver eyes narrowed on Harry. The colour might have been the same as Draco\u2019s, but the hue wasn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t the same kindness and love in them that Draco\u2019s held. This was a pale comparison.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d The tone itself was of boredom, but Harry could see the way reluctant curiosity shone in Lucius\u2019 eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s funny that you don\u2019t know me,\u201d Harry began in a whisper that carried around the room. \u201cI have spent quite a bit of time despising everything you stand for. Not just your political beliefs, but the way you handle those you are meant to love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lucius made a noise of understanding. \u201cYou are here on Draco\u2019s behalf.\u201d A sneer accompanied a smug expression, and it took everything Harry had not to punch the pretentious prick in the mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t know me because I was someone you thought would be unworthy of Draco. You don\u2019t know me because your moronic viewpoints on life caused several years of doubt inside of him. I was raised as a Muggle and because of that, you chose to believe that <em>I </em>can\u2019t be his soulmate. Well, fuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A slight cough in the background had Harry wondering if the guard was covering up a laugh. At least he was enjoying himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuck your pureblood entitlement. Fuck your beliefs. Fuck your horrible existence and fuck your shite parenting skills.\u201d He paused to breathe once, centering himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way Lucius had reared his head back, as if he had been slapped, was so far the highlight of the trip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDespite the lack of empathy, compassion, love, and respect you haven\u2019t given Draco, he has turned out to be one of the best people I have ever known. He cares about others. Sure it\u2019s more subtle and internal, but he does care.\u201d Harry lifted one shoulder wondering how far that statement could go. Draco wasn\u2019t a people person, but still held compassion for others. Just not so readily as some.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe loves fiercely and completely. Despite never seeing or experiencing love, he has so much of it to give. Draco has a hard time seeing his worth because of <em>you</em>. He doubts himself and hates part of who he is.\u201d Harry closed his eyes tightly, blocking out the sight of the Malfoy patriarch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hate that you took so much from him. So much of his personal growth and his youth. You wanted to shape him into what you saw he should be and not who he truly is. It\u2019s not your job to mould him into what <em>you </em>want. All you had to do was be there for him and love him. Fuck, if that is too much to ask, then you are a completely hopeless case. What kind of parent are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne that did what I had to.\u201d It was barely a whisper, but it was enough to have Harry snapping his eyes open and slamming his hands on the table the man was chained to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that what you tell yourself alone in Azkaban? You keep this delusion to allow you to have a false sense of warmth as you shiver on the bloody ground?

No parent harms their child. You disgust me.\u201d He narrowed his eyes when the man smirked at him. Being here was nearly pointless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI debated about coming here. It\u2019s not my place to speak for Draco, but you robbed him the chance of doing this himself. If he could leave St. Mungo\u2019s and tell you all of this, he would. I hate that he won\u2019t get the closure he deserves, but I hate you more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry shook his head, unsure if any of this even mattered in the end. Lucius wouldn\u2019t reconsider his lot in life, nor would he be repentant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe only solace that I have is that you will rot without your soul. The moment the Dementor kisses you, you will be nothing but an empty vessel that will slowly slip away. It\u2019s fitting that this would be your justice, because without a soul you won\u2019t be cognitive, no sense of who you are or where you are. Your mental awareness is gone, and your eyes will never perceive a single thing again. Do you see the correlation I am making?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way Lucius sat up straighter had Harry smirking. \u201cThe symptoms of what you did to Draco are strikingly similar to the fate that awaits you. Every time Draco enters an episode, I <em>know </em>that he will come back to me. But unlike Draco, you never will. You are doomed to <em>never </em>be the same again. They say it\u2019s a fate worse than death. Which is something that you <em>deserve</em>. You deserve to not only experience what he has to go through but every karma imaginable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hatred was something that Harry was used to seeing. Only this time, he relished in it. Loved the bitter anger marring Lucius\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWishing the worst for someone never works out well,\u201d Harry whispered angrily. \u201cBut I could care less.

Perhaps at first, he hadn\u2019t understood why Harry would bother but the longer he thought about it, the more he realized how amazing it was to have someone care like Harry did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust tell me one thing,\u201d Draco patted the bed, waiting until Harry laid down next to him. \u201cTell me you were dramatic and feisty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry grinned, rubbing his nose along Draco\u2019s jaw. \u201cI channelled you all the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood,\u201d Draco sighed, by now the kiss would have been administered. It was freeing in a way. The man was his father, but only in the sense of a title and not by actual means of the word. He wouldn\u2019t miss Lucius, but he would miss the what-ifs. The thoughts that he used to treasure as a child. The wonder if his father would ever come around.

He wanted that desperately. Any life with Draco was a good one. He didn\u2019t hate this one or resent what they didn\u2019t have. But he couldn\u2019t help the twitch in his heart at the thought of sharing a life outside of St. Mungo\u2019s with Draco.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hope.
