  "text": "<p>There wasn\u2019t a single heartbeat in the camp.</p>\n<p>Fifteen large tents stretched out on the hill before them. They could see belongings gathered around them, vital supplies no one would leave behind, and there wasn\u2019t a single heartbeat. There should\u2019ve been over fifty in a pack with that many tents.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, I smell blood,\u201d Erica said quietly, and he knew what they would find.</p>\n<p>The scene was hauntingly familiar as they moved through the camp; bodies strewn between tents, arrows jutting out, dark stains of blood covered in a fresh powdering of snow. The only difference was that the hunters who did this hadn\u2019t used fire to clean up after themselves, just left the corpses to freeze through the winter and be picked apart by animals.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead,\u201d Isaac murmured in awe, and it was then that Derek remembered that he had never seen carnage like this. He\u2019d gone through more than his fair share of struggles, but his life held relatively few horrors of this magnitude.</p>\n<p>Scott briefly met Derek\u2019s eyes and joined Isaac, guiding him away, already talking. Scott was good at that kind of thing\u2014comforting, easing fragile people into trauma and out again, keeping them focused on easy tasks. Derek was not. He never had been.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpread out, find anything useful,\u201d Derek quietly ordered Erica and Boyd. He hated himself for it, but they needed the supplies, and none of this pack would be missing them.</p>\n<p>He started at one end of the camp, picking through empty tents for heavier blankets, clothing, food, water\u2014anything. They needed everything at this point, for when hunting was scarce and their blankets wore through from sleeping on rough ground. He didn\u2019t know this region very well, didn\u2019t know when they would have another chance to trade for more.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek.\u201d Scott pushed through the flap of the tent, and Derek looked up from sizing boots for Erica. He didn\u2019t like the dread in his voice, or on his face when he saw it.</p>\n<p>Or the arrow he held in his hand. </p>\n<p>It was a horribly familiar arrow; black shaft, black feathers, silver tip, fleur de lis carved into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Argent,\u201d Scott said unnecessarily, as if either of them would ever forget those arrows. \u201cThey did it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek took a deep, shaky breath through the surge of emotions that brought, and looked down at the rest of the boots lined up neatly at the entrance. The smallest pair could fit in his palm.</p>\n<p>He and Scott had both been too broken to do anything before, but the Argents couldn\u2019t get away with this. Not again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis time we\u2019re going after them,\u201d he decided, turning back to Scott.</p>\n<p>Scott nodded, jaw clenched and determined. \u201cDo you think any of them are still in the area?\u201d</p>\n<p>Judging by the snowfall on the corpses, it had been a few days since the massacre happened. They hadn\u2019t in the past, but it was possible they left a few hunters nearby, in case any survivors returned, so Derek still closed his eyes and focused his hearing far out in the trees around them just be to sure. </p>\n<p>It was silent, unnaturally so, except\u2026</p>\n<p>A heartbeat he didn't recognize. Weak, faint, dying.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s still alive.\u201d </p>\n<p>Scott tilted his head to the side, straining his ears, but his face didn\u2019t show any recognition. Derek stepped around him, out of the tent, following the sluggish heartbeat down the path a ways. Had an Argent been injured bad enough to be left behind? That was uncommon for hunters, leaving their own, but if it meant Derek could find out where they were headed, he\u2019d take it. It was more than they\u2019d had to go on for over six years.</p>\n<p>But it became obvious very quickly that the dying man was not a hunter, or a wolf.</p>\n<p>He was lying next to the cold, frozen body of a woman, and even before he touched him, Derek could feel the magic radiating from him. The tattoos weaving up the side of his throat labeled him as an emissary, blanketed in spells to hide his presence from anyone looking for survivors. His masking was well done, incredibly so, but Derek's mother at least had time to teach him to see through emissary magic.</p>\n<p>Some of it, anyway.</p>\n<p>Scott hurried over, dropped to his knees, and pressed his fingers to the man\u2019s throat, just on the edge of the tattoos. He frowned in both surprise and confusion when dark, unfocused eyes opened at his touch. They only stayed open for a second, probably not really seeing anything, before they slid closed, and barely flickered again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Scott breathed, then looked up to ask, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear his heart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s masked himself with magic to protect himself,\" Derek explained shortly. \"It was probably an unconscious survival instinct. He\u2019s an emissary. Or, <em>was,\u201d </em>he added, sweeping his gaze over the lifeless corpses surrounding them. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey attacked an emissary?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey probably thought it was kinder than leaving him alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott's face crumpled in sympathy as he looked back down to the dying man; emissaries were indelibly tied to their packs, to their alpha, with some of the oldest and strongest magic known. The loss of his pack would kill this man even if his injuries and the cold somehow didn't.</p>\n<p>Derek stood in silent respect for the emissary and his fallen pack, giving them a moment of his thoughts before he would put them behind and move on. But Scott reached out for the man and pressed his palm to his throat over his tattoo, gentle even though he was already unconscious. The black of pain snaked up through his veins and the man exhaled in relief, slipping deeper into sleep. He probably wouldn\u2019t wake up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep moving,\u201d Derek decided, watching Isaac cover a small body a few tents away. They\u2019d already been there too long, stirred up too many forgotten memories he wanted to stay gone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looked up with a golden flare of anger in his eyes, black still crawling through his veins from the man\u2019s body. \"We can't just leave him here to die.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's an emissary, Scott.\u201d Derek tried to make his tone empathetic, but Scott\u2019s tendency to fight back on everything always grated on his nerves. \u201cHis pack is gone, he won't survive more than a day or two either way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then we should stay with him.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Argents\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Will still be there in two days,\" Scott finished pleadingly. \"We can move faster than them, we'll catch up. I won't leave him to die alone here.\"</p>\n<p>Derek sighed as he studied the man for a moment; he was too pale against the fur rim of his hood, almost grey from lying out in the snow, and his cloak was stained with dark dried blood around a protruding arrow shaft. It was unlikely he would even last the night. They would probably be able to carry on in the morning with little time lost, if any.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a horrible idea, Derek decided reluctantly. They hadn't been able to set up a real camp for a few weeks in the open foothills, and they were all on edge from sleeping in exposed areas. A defensible place to sleep would be good for them, even if they were surrounded by death. They would be able to give the pack proper burials, at the very least.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. One night,\u201d Derek relented, already moving away to check on Isaac. \u201cHe\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott just nodded and got to work.</p>\n<p>He carefully moved the man into an empty tent, one that didn't smell like death and decay. He started a small fire in the center pit and meticulously tended to the man's side wound and other injuries he found. It was a lost cause, but there was no harm in letting him try, or letting Isaac join him. It gave them something positive to focus on while surrounded by so much death.</p>\n<p>Derek left them to it and took Erica and Boyd with him to patrol and establish a perimeter, check out the area around them, make sure there was no lingering danger from hunters. The scent of them had gone stale, and there was hardly a trace of them in the woods, so there wasn't any great danger of traps set for any escaped pack members returning for their dead.</p>\n<p>In fact, the surrounding woods were just as empty and lifeless as the camp, so they moved further out and hunted for dinner to take back. They still didn\u2019t find anymore survivors.</p>\n<p>When Derek returned to the tent bringing food, the wounded man was wrapped in furs and blankets Scott and Isaac must have gathered from around the camp. They still smelled like the dead pack, and the scent would be a comfort for their emissary in his final hours, even if it did raise Derek\u2019s hackles to be so thickly surrounded by it.</p>\n<p>\"He's doing better,\" Scott announced happily, surprising Derek as he let the door flap close behind him. \"He's actually getting stronger.\"</p>\n<p>Derek set down the plate of cooked meat on a stool and leaned over the cot to see for himself. The man looked less death-like, a little less grey, but his dark moles still stood out stark against his too-pale complexion and a flush of fever had taken over his cheeks. Warming him up may have just brought more issues to light.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis breathing is clearer,\" Scott continued unprompted, \"and I think his magic took over once we removed the arrow. The bleeding\u2019s stopped and it looks like it\u2019s starting to scab already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raised an eyebrow; he hadn't known emissaries could heal themselves like that, especially with no pack left to strengthen them. There was a lot he didn't know about emissaries; his mother had died before she could teach him everything.</p>\n<p>\"He must have finally dropped his defenses,\" Derek mused. Allowed his magic to focus on healing himself, or they had just fallen because they couldn't keep up while he was so weak.</p>\n<p>Warm brown eyes chose that moment to open, staring up at Derek and Scott like their presence barely registered. They roamed around for a moment, then fixed on Scott's face and blinked hazily. He said something quietly, in a language Derek didn\u2019t know, and surprisingly Scott laughed and responded in the same tongue. The young man grinned weakly and let his eyes close again, falling back to unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott jumped a little, like he\u2019d forgotten his alpha was there. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I be able to understand him?\u201d Derek snapped impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what language he\u2019s speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Polish. Remember our emissary?\u201d Derek nodded. How could he forget? She\u2019d been his mother\u2019s best friend in life and died alongside the pack she swore to protect. \u201cIt was her native language. She taught me some when I was little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what did he say?\u201d Derek asked, desperate for a change in topic.</p>\n<p>Scott grinned. \u201cHe told me my face was crooked.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Derek hoped the man really did survive. Those would be terrible last words.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Amazingly, against Derek\u2019s every expectation, the man didn't die during the night, and it seemed like he got stronger with every hour that crawled past. He wasn't healing anywhere near as fast as a wolf, but every time Scott pulled back the blankets to check on his side, it had visibly healed a little more. It seemed now that he\u2019d lowered his guards his magic really was speeding up the process, in addition to whatever Scott was doing. </p>\n<p>The pack spent the night in that tent, where their scent was already seeping into the corners to cover those before. They huddled on the floor together, using each other\u2019s bodies as pillows as they usually did, lulled by Scott\u2019s soft voice speaking to the emissary. He stayed up with him through the night, whispering to him in Polish whenever he woke and drawing his pain away. The man didn\u2019t seem entirely lucid, but the sound of his own language put him at ease, even while surrounded by unknown werewolves.</p>\n<p>At least until the early hours of daylight, when he suddenly shot up with wide and panicked eyes, grabbed Scott\u2019s arm next to him, and frantically let out a stream of Polish Derek couldn\u2019t understand. It took a few minutes to get him calm and lying down again, and even then he still didn\u2019t let go of Scott\u2019s forearm as he fell back into a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Derek asked quietly, not wanting to wake him again.</p>\n<p>Scott turned to him, expression grave. \u201cHe said that the Argents are on their way to wipe out his tribe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s chest tightened. \u201cAs in\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA tribe of humans and unbound emissaries in training, yeah. They\u2019re going to cripple a hundred packs in one blow.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s tribe wouldn\u2019t be the only gathering of emissaries; there were communities in almost every region where emissaries raised their families and trained their children until they left home to join their destined packs. Some tribes were larger and more well known than others, but their exact locations were always kept secret for their own protection, to prevent exactly this type of thing. Protecting themselves against the supernatural wasn\u2019t an issue, their ash barriers took care of that easily, but against human hunters looking to damage wolf packs, all bets were off.</p>\n<p>An emissary tribe had never been attacked like this; there was no telling what chaos it would cause.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet him fixed up and moving. We\u2019re leaving today,\u201d Derek ordered, and for once Scott didn\u2019t argue. He just nodded, already pulling back the blankets to check the emissary\u2019s side after his sudden movements. </p>\n<p>They left a few hours later, following the barely visible trail the hunters left towards the mountains, and though the man was indeed up and moving, he wasn\u2019t for long. After two hours of slow walking, he collapsed, and Scott carried him on his back until they made camp for the night. Derek could hear them at the back of the group, chatting quietly in Polish the entire way, even though the emissary\u2019s voice was weak and scratchy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles says the fastest path to his tribe is to cut through the northern mountain pass, but it\u2019s still going to take us at least two weeks to get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looked up from his food to stare at Scott settling down next to him by the fire. Isaac had first watch in the dark woods around them and Erica and Boyd were already asleep, half on top of each other under their blankets. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name he gives to packs who don\u2019t speak Polish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glanced across the fire to <em>Stiles,</em> who was deep asleep and curled up under a warm blanket he brought from his pack\u2019s camp. It hardly smelled like them anymore after being in Scott\u2019s bag all day, but the memory alone must\u2019ve been some kind of comfort. </p>\n<p>Derek was amazed at how well he\u2019d handled the loss so far; there were stories of emissaries going mad from the silence and loss of connection, killing themselves, or simply losing the will to live after losing their packs. Stiles smelled sad, almost constantly, but it was nowhere near what Derek had been preparing himself for. He was still half expecting the madness and grief to hit at any moment, a delayed reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe also said he\u2019ll be moving faster tomorrow,\u201d Scott continued. \u201cAll of his energy is going into healing himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded. He\u2019d figured as much; he wasn\u2019t judging Stiles for slowing them down after being shot with an arrow and left to die in the snow for at least a couple days. It was frustrating how slow their progress was and he <em>wanted</em> to be mad at the emissary, but he couldn\u2019t blame him without just feeling guilty. Derek could tell he was moving as fast as he could. Probably faster than he should\u2019ve been considering he\u2019d been at death\u2019s door the day before.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill he be able to make it through the northern pass? It\u2019s not an easy path, even for us.\u201d It was rocky and frigid and covered in deep snowdrifts all year round, with frequent snowstorms through the winter. Even werewolves died up there if they weren\u2019t prepared, and all humans stuck to the long way around the mountain range at lower altitudes. They didn\u2019t even try.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says he can.\u201d Scott didn\u2019t look all that confident. \u201cHe said the Argents would never risk it, so it\u2019s the only way to get ahead of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek let his eyes drift back to the emissary. Even curled up under all the blankets he had, he looked cold already, and they were still in the foothills.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find him warmer blankets. A heavier cloak. Boots.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott nodded. \u201cThere should be a human settlement to the east. It might add a day, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have warmer things than his pack did.\u201d</p>\n<p>If they were taking the northern pass, they could afford an extra day, even with how much the snow would slow them down. They needed Stiles alive; he was the only one who knew where they were going.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave at first light. Get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek went back to his food, watching from the corner of his eye as Scott stood and moved towards Erica and Boyd, before detouring to lie next to Stiles instead.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Even after he recovered and they were moving at a faster pace, Stiles still really only talked to Scott, but he talked <em>a lot.</em> The two brought up the rear as they headed north, walking together through the days, and sitting together by the fire at night, speaking quickly and quietly with hushing syllables that seemed to run together while still abruptly cutting off. Occasionally Derek overheard Stiles trying out English words and phrases, sprinkled throughout their conversations, but never directed towards anyone but Scott.</p>\n<p>For the most part he would sit quietly around the fire at night, listening to the conversations going on around him, paying close attention and watching whoever spoke intently, like he could absorb the language through proximity. And maybe he could, because it didn\u2019t take long for Stiles to learn English at all; after just two days of listening, he was joining in on conversations, tripping over his sentences a little, and two days after that he was bickering with Erica like he\u2019d been speaking the language for years. He still had an accent, just tinging his words, but any trouble he\u2019d had in conversations was gone.</p>\n<p>Derek knew that emissaries had the ability to pick up languages quickly, and it was said that they had a natural affinity towards the language of their rightful pack from birth. Derek didn\u2019t know how it worked exactly, but if Stiles could pick up English that fast, it must have been amazing how quickly he\u2019d picked up the language of his pack\u2014probably French, given that they were the Chevelle pack.</p>\n<p>Though as impressive as his language skills were, there was a definite downside: now that he could speak with them, he made his opinions known frequently, loudly, and often while mocking Derek\u2019s decisions. Erica <em>loved </em>it. She went out of her way to ask him about everything Derek did, solely to laugh at him, and he would be angry, but he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he heard her laugh.</p>\n<p>Scott and Stiles had become inseparable from the start, Isaac pretended to be disinterested in him but seemed to carefully study everything he did, and even Boyd would smirk silently by the fire.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a massive change, but the energy had shifted, and for the first time in years, it seemed as though Derek\u2019s pack was starting to live instead of just surviving. Maybe it was Stiles, maybe it was finally having a clear destination instead of aimless wandering, but it was something, and it made Derek feel like he wasn\u2019t as terrible at being an alpha as he\u2019d thought.</p>\n<p>That lasted until they climbed the mountains high enough to hit deeper snow\u2014then Derek regretted every decision he\u2019d made that had led them there. He was an awful alpha, inept, and his mother would never have put her pack through something like this.</p>\n<p>The wolves were mostly alright in the cold. It was hard progress but there were plenty of caves in the mountain to hide from the winds and rest at night, so it was bearable, even if they were all too exhausted to do anything but collapse when they stopped\u2014but it was taking a toll on Stiles. He didn't ever say anything about it, in English or Polish, because Scott would\u2019ve said something if he had, but he was moving slower, sleeping harder and longer, lying closer and closer to the fire every night. They weren't moving at a wolf's fastest pace, but they were still making faster time than humans ever could, even with the snow. It was impressive that Stiles could even keep up.</p>\n<p>Not to say that he was small or weak, he definitely wasn\u2019t. He was slim and lithe under his heavy cloak and layers, but he had broad shoulders and large, strong hands that suggested a deeper power and strength. If anyone so much as suggested making camp earlier than usual for his benefit, Stiles would roll his eyes and stomp ahead until they got the picture and kept moving.</p>\n<p>In fact, now that he was healed and his magic had recuperated from working to repair his body, Stiles was starting to show just what he could do as an emissary. Every night when they made camp in whatever cave they could find, Stiles would journey right back out into the snow with Scott to place wards in a perimeter to warn them of anyone coming with enough time to prepare or escape. Normally Derek would rely on his own hearing for this, but the howling wind and constant snowstorms drowned out everything, leaving them no choice but to rely on Stiles. </p>\n<p>(Derek didn\u2019t know how it worked, but it was truly eerie when Stiles would perk up from his food around the fire, eyes distant and ringed in a glowing blue for a long moment, before he announced \u201cdeer\u201d and returned to his meal like nothing happened. He never explained how he could tell, said it would be like explaining how to feel warmth or wind.)</p>\n<p>It bothered him how much it didn\u2019t bother him, letting Stiles handle that, but they all started sleeping better with the extra layer of security.</p>\n<p>On colder nights, as they climbed higher and higher into the mountains, Stiles would throw some kind of plant onto the fire that made it burn a little hotter, winking if anyone asked what it was. None of them could identify it by smell.</p>\n<p>When Erica slipped on an icy rock and snapped her ankle, Stiles was there, fingertips glowing the same calming blue as his eyes, speeding up the healing process however he could, and making jokes to keep her laughing.</p>\n<p>But when they crossed over the crest of the mountain range, they no longer had the mountain itself blocking the worst of the wind, and their journey became ten times harder. Even the wolves had trouble keeping their footing in the near-constant snowstorms, and Scott kept huddled next to Stiles the entire way through, blocking what wind he could and keeping him upright when he stumbled.</p>\n<p>It was frigid and Stiles couldn\u2019t even set up wards by the time he collapsed at night; his magic drained throughout the day trying to keep his limbs from succumbing to frostbite that left his fingers stiff and grey. The shadows under his eyes were getting darker, his skin was losing its color\u2014humans weren\u2019t made to survive up here, no matter how much magic they had.</p>\n<p>Derek was worried about him, they all were. They were still at least a week\u2019s travel from warmer temperatures and it felt like he was slipping away and they couldn\u2019t do anything to help him. He wasn\u2019t their emissary, he didn\u2019t belong to them, but they\u2019d all grown attached so quickly\u2014no matter how reluctantly. Watching him struggle was bad enough, but watching him die this time would be unbearable.</p>\n<p>Still, he refused to admit anything was really wrong and kept talking, making jokes, making fun of them whenever possible, when even the wolves were too exhausted to do anything but eat in silence and collapse into sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be better at this than me,\u201d Stiles admonished through chattering teeth from his blankets right next to the fire, and Boyd tried to kick him without exposing his leg to the frigid air.</p>\n<p>Everyone else dropped off to sleep quickly, Scott had first watch with Stiles\u2019 wards no longer an option, bundled up at the mouth of the cave, but Derek couldn\u2019t relax, refused to. Even blocked from the wind with a fire going, Stiles was likely to freeze to death. The blankets he had weren\u2019t warm enough for the snowy weather this far into the mountains and even the heavier cloak and furs they\u2019d traded for in the foothills weren\u2019t helping much.</p>\n<p>Derek only held out for another minute before worry and guilt crept up on him and he broke, slipping under the blankets with him without a word. He looped his arm around Stiles\u2019 tense stomach and pulled him back against his chest, holding him there until his violent shivering finally eased and he could relax, practically going limp in Derek's arms.</p>\n<p>He murmured a sleepily thanks, before finally giving in to his exhaustion and drifting off. </p>\n<p>Derek stayed awake for a while after, long enough to see Scott return to wake him for the second watch, and instead take one look at Stiles and move to wake Isaac instead.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Somehow (Derek honestly wasn\u2019t sure how or when this conversation took place) it was decided that as alpha, Derek was the warmest and therefore the one who would be sleeping with Stiles every night. The pack wouldn\u2019t even let him take watch anymore, saying that someone had to keep the lone human who knew where they were going from freezing to death in his sleep, and Derek was the most efficient.</p>\n<p>(This conversation of course happened in hushed whispers over Stiles\u2019 deeply sleeping form, because had he been aware they were scheduling these things around him, he would\u2019ve been furious and probably frozen to death while personally taking a watch shift purely out of spite.)</p>\n<p>So that was the routine; struggling through snow and howling wind until they found a suitable cave, starting a fire, and Derek seating Stiles right next to it to thaw. They all ate together quietly, exhausted from the day, Scott took any aches and pains from Stiles' shiver-sore muscles while Derek set up their bed, and then he curled around the emissary for the night. </p>\n<p>Stiles usually dropped off immediately, worn out from keeping with the fast pace of the wolves and the cold, but without fail he snapped back awake after a few hours. He always woke with a jolt, waking Derek as well, and it was during the dark and quiet hours of early morning that they started to whisper.</p>\n<p>It started simple; Stiles muttering apologies when he couldn\u2019t keep still, when he accidentally kneed Derek in the thigh, when an icy gust of winter wind made it back to them through the cave and he burrowed into Derek\u2019s throat under his beard to escape it. Derek would shush him, gather his long and frigid fingers into his warm palms, and Stiles would begin to talk. A lot.</p>\n<p>He talked about his people, the time he burned off his eyebrows while preparing to join his pack, his father who was captain of his tribe\u2019s defenses, his mother dying when he was young\u2014he covered every possible topic. Derek was quickly becoming accustomed to sleepily humming along while Stiles lectured him on plants until he finally drifted off again. He usually slept through the night until morning after that, but occasionally he would jolt awake again a second or even third time, catching Derek in the chin or elbowing him in the stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d Derek murmured sleepily, exhausted, side hurting, but wanting to make sure nothing was wrong.</p>\n<p>Stiles shifted restlessly before whispering, \u201cNightmare. Sorry I woke you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stared at the dying embers of the fire as he fully woke up, absently thinking he should get up and add another log before it died completely to distract himself from how stupid he\u2019d been to not realize Stiles had been having nightmares this entire time. Of course he was, his pack had been slaughtered right in front of him and he\u2019d been left to die with their bodies. No wonder he talked so much about home and innocuous topics after waking up from one.</p>\n<p>As horrible as it sounded, Derek had almost...<em>forgotten</em> about the Chevelle pack, with how Stiles had carried on after. He didn\u2019t smell like them at all anymore, their furs and blankets had been traded away for heartier supplies, Stiles never mentioned them; had he even gotten a chance to mourn them? Cry for his lost pack?</p>\n<p>Derek knew personally how important it was to have that chance. He and Scott had suffered for too long on their own trying to be strong for the other, denying they were anything but fine, until the rage and grief and resentment bubbled over and almost tore them apart for good. They were still dealing with the remnants from it today, the underlying tension that had never been there growing up.</p>\n<p>Derek cleared his throat quietly. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s okay to cry\u2026\u201d he trailed off at Stiles frowning up at him.</p>\n<p>Right. It wasn\u2019t his place to tell someone how to grieve. Stiles had been amazingly strong even just surviving that kind of trauma, he could clearly handle the grieving process himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <em>that</em> cold,\u201d Stiles muttered, lying, but burrowed in closer all the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant\u2014\u201d Derek huffed. Of course this would be difficult; everything was difficult for him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your pack.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles was quiet for a moment, then murmured quietly, \u201cThey weren\u2019t my pack.\u201d Derek frowned over his head at the dark cave wall, and Stiles continued, \u201cIt was temporary. Their emissary wasn\u2019t ready and they needed protection, and an unbound emissary is better than none.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek had never heard of that before, but it explained why Stiles recovered instead of being completely destroyed by the massacre. </p>\n<p>He blinked down at him, processing, and Stiles craned his neck to look up at the awkward silence until Derek asked, \u201cThen where\u2019s <em>your</em> pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiled sadly, like he was expecting the question. \u201cI don\u2019t have one. They were all killed when I was a child, so I\u2019m a...temporary emissary, I guess. I work with packs until their true emissary finishes their training and can take over,\" he explained at Derek\u2019s confusion.</p>\n<p>That...was a horribly lonely way to live, with nowhere to really belong and no one to rely on, no connection. It went against everything an emissary was supposed to be. </p>\n<p>Derek could relate, on some level, but at least he still had his pack\u2014if they could even be called that. Scott fought him on every decision, they\u2019d found Isaac as an omega on the run, Erica and Boyd terrified and trying to survive after their own pack was attacked\u2014they were all just cobbled together, lonely survivors. They didn't even have their own territory, he and Scott had been unable to keep living where their own pack and family had been slaughtered.</p>\n<p>Stiles fit right in, in that respect. He didn't have a place to belong either, didn't fit into the norm. Not even in appearance.</p>\n<p>Every emissary Derek had seen was covered in tattoos; the more they had, the more bound to their pack. As far as he could tell, Stiles only had the two on either side of his throat, intertwined lines tracing an animal up to the bottoms of his ears.</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t know all that much about the process of how an emissary found their pack or how the magic in the tattoos bound them to it. There were rumors, and his mother vaguely explained what she knew about it once when he was little, but it was unclear and a tightly kept secret in the tribes of emissaries. He only knew there was a trance involved, that as a child an emissary would have to unconsciously seek out the symbol of their pack: their first tattoo.</p>\n<p>Stiles also had this tattoo, across his scalp just behind his right ear but hidden in his hair. Derek had seen hints of it when he lay behind him by the fire, but he\u2019d never been able to make out the faded pattern. Most emissaries kept the side of their head shaved and the tattoo fresh and clear, proudly showing their pack allegiance, and it was heartbreaking that Stiles had just let his hair grow over it. There was no point in associating with a long dead pack, and seeing another crest would only rankle the instincts of whatever pack he was working with temporarily.</p>\n<p>He had to forfeit his own identity for the sake of others. He'd had his identity stripped from him when his own pack was killed. He never even had the chance to be himself the way he was meant to be, and never would.</p>\n<p>Derek couldn\u2019t believe the universe was that cruel, not to someone as selfless as Stiles. That wasn\u2019t the life he was supposed to lead.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe some of them are still out there somewhere,\" he whispered, trying to be uncharacteristically optimistic.</p>\n<p>Stiles shook his head a little against his bent arm he was using as a pillow. \"I felt it when it happened. I\u2019d never met them, but I felt it.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about these?\" Derek traced his thumb down one of the woven lines on Stiles\u2019 throat that created some kind of animal, following the lines with his eyes before meeting his amber gaze again. \"What do these mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 throat jumped under Derek\u2019s hand as he swallowed before answering quietly. \u201cIt means my pack was a wolf pack. Every emissary has a tattoo representing their alpha, it\u2019s the second one we get.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek reached his fingers around to the wolf's brother on the other side, brushing across those lines and cradling his throat lightly. Stiles' heart stayed steady, unafraid.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugged his shoulder. \u201cI like symmetry.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe it means you have another pack waiting for you, another alpha.\" A purpose in life that wouldn't leave him alone, no matter how much Derek selfishly didn't want to let go of him. Maybe even one that kept them together, that gave some kind of legitimacy to the connection he felt.</p>\n<p>The corner of Stiles' mouth quirked up into a morose smile. \"You can't have two packs. I\u2019m just...the extra. Unnecessary. Someone has to be.\"</p>\n<p>Derek frowned at his deprecating answer\u2014what he did sounded incredibly necessary\u2014and moved his hand to run his fingers through the hair over the hidden sign of Stiles' lost pack.</p>\n<p>\"No, not you. You're so important, Stiles,\" he corrected softly, brushing his thumb over it and deciding not to think about the buzz of energy he felt from it. It wasn't his to take, it was another alpha's, another pack's. He wouldn't steal from the dead this time.</p>\n<p>Stiles' smile changed, it was subtle but the other corner turned up and his eyes softened, flicking down to Derek's lips briefly before he shifted closer. He hesitated for a moment, and Derek didn't dare move a muscle should he shatter the careful and fragile moment.</p>\n<p>He felt it all through his body when their lips touched, a low level electricity shooting through his nerves and calling his instincts to attention, to claim. And though he was happy he had this in the moment, he couldn't stave off the extreme sadness he felt that he couldn't keep it, and for whatever pack was missing this; the ones who had been killed before they were able to know the streak of vibrant lightning that was Stiles in their lives, but also the aching vulnerability he hid except in the quietest hours of night, and the softness of his touch, the overly bright smiles during the day...</p>\n<p>It wasn't fair that Derek should get to taste this only to have it ripped away to move onto another pack that would never truly know their <em>temporary emissary</em>. He hated that phrase, the way it cheapened what was supposed to be a deep and irreplaceable bond between two people and made it something that could be tossed away at will when the real thing came along. That <em>Stiles</em> could be tossed away for the real thing. He hated that Stiles would never be able to feel what Derek\u2019s mother had described, the unspeakable closeness she had felt with her emissary to their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Stiles pulled back and Derek opened his eyes, unaware that they'd slipped closed. His chest ached at the broken edge Stiles' smile had taken on, the way his eyes looked a little glassy for the brief second he allowed his weakness to show before he tucked his face into Derek's throat as he did every night.</p>\n<p>Derek just breathed for a moment, breathed in the scent of Stiles and them together with their pack, and let himself believe that they could have it. He wrapped his arm around Stiles' broad shoulders and pulled him closer, holding tight until he drifted off to sleep to the steady breathing against his chest.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before their relationship escalated, from quiet kisses when they were wrapped around each other against the cold, to hushed and desperate sex hidden away in the back corners of caves, tucked away from the rest of the group. They all knew exactly what was going on, but like Derek and Stiles, they didn\u2019t talk about it. No one wanted to acknowledge what would happen when they encountered the Argents, or reached Stiles' tribe, or how it would feel if they all survived and had to part for good. </p>\n<p>Packs didn't stay near emissary tribes, it wasn\u2019t safe, and even if they could stay in the region with him, Stiles had his duties. He would be leaving again for another pack who needed him. It was important, what he did, for both packs and their future rightful emissary, who wouldn't be rushed into their place before they were ready, and it said a lot about his skill that he could do that. But Derek couldn't deny the overwhelming urge to fill Stiles' empty skin with marks of his own, bind him to their pack for good and keep him from others. He wanted his own crest marking Stiles' scalp, hair shaved back proudly for the world to see.</p>\n<p>It was impossible, he knew that, no one could force an emissary bond that wasn\u2019t meant to be there, but that didn\u2019t stop him from sucking bruises into his pale skin, a temporary and fleeting shadow of what he truly wanted.</p>\n<p>He realized that this need wasn't right or fair to Stiles who just wanted to save his people, who had never asked for a broken pack and an even further broken alpha to grow so attached. He knew all of this and still couldn't help it.</p>\n<p>But even as they descended down the eastern side of the mountain, reaching slightly warmer weather that didn't cut through Stiles' clothing in the same way, they still wrapped around each other at night, clung to each other in a different, desperate way that made Derek hope that maybe this wasn't as one sided as he thought. That maybe Stiles wanted to stay just as badly as the pack wanted to keep him.</p>\n<p>It wasn't fair, wishing this broken and insecure future on him, a nomadic pack without a territory, but something about Stiles made everything seem a little less fractured, a little more hopeful for the future. And he wasn\u2019t the only one thinking that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe feels right,\u201d Scott said, coming to stand next to Derek on the rocky outcropping he\u2019d chosen to scout ahead. Stiles was back with the others, and when Derek left them, he\u2019d been giving an indifferent Boyd a lecture on the properties of a certain plant he\u2019d found growing along their path. </p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t look at him, didn\u2019t want to engage. He kept his eyes on the horizon, glaring out for signs of life, that they were getting closer. That didn\u2019t stop Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could be ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott\u2014\u201d Derek had been trying really hard to suppress those kinds of thoughts, he didn\u2019t need anyone else validating them or giving him hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know his crest and he doesn\u2019t know ours,\u201d Scott pushed. \u201cHe could be\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cScott.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should talk to him about it. I know he wants to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cStop it,\u201d</em> Derek growled, and Scott swallowed down his reflexive growl back. \u201cHis pack is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOur </em>pack is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur pack is right here,\u201d Derek snapped, finally turning to meet Scott\u2019s confrontational glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen where\u2019s our emissary?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek clenched his jaw and repeated the lie he\u2019d been telling himself and the others for years now. \u201cThey\u2019ll come when they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolled his eyes and walked away, leaving Derek with the constant crippling fear that his pack was too broken, too weak for an emissary. That he was so insignificant, so terrible an alpha, never supposed to be alpha in the first place, that the universe hadn\u2019t seen fit to waste a person even half as wonderful as Stiles on the likes of him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Despite his best efforts to forget them, Scott\u2019s words stuck with him throughout the day, night, and following afternoon.</p>\n<p>Stiles did feel right, like he belonged. He fit seamlessly into the pack with a smirk and a wink, and Scott was right, they didn\u2019t know his crest or what pack the universe deemed he belonged to. He spoke the language of the last Hale emissary, who had died, and Stiles\u2019 mother had died, and he\u2019d never said <em>when</em> he felt his pack die\u2014maybe he felt the very same deaths that tore Derek\u2019s life apart.</p>\n<p>Packs could be passed through family lines of emissaries, Derek knew that much, just like the alpha position.</p>\n<p>It was possible.</p>\n<p>He just couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask. Having no answer, there was at least the possibility of Stiles staying, but if their marks didn\u2019t match...Stiles would have no reason to stay with them, not when he had other packs to guide, and Derek didn\u2019t know what he would do when he left.</p>\n<p>But not knowing was eating away at him, and Stiles was noticing. Probably. It could\u2019ve been Derek\u2019s own paranoia about it, but it certainly felt like Stiles was giving him <em>looks</em> as they traveled. Meaningful looks. Watching him closely in conversations, like he was looking for answers to why Derek was acting the way he was.</p>\n<p>Even Scott was noticing, but his looks weren\u2019t so much curious as annoyingly loaded. <em>Talk to him,</em> they said,<em> ask about his mark</em>\u2014as if it were that simple. A pack mark was a statement of identity, and covering it up a statement to let it go and move on. Derek couldn\u2019t just drag it all back to the surface and <em>ask</em> about it.</p>\n<p>So like the brave alpha he was, he tried to catch indirect glimpses of it. Glanced over while Stiles was walking in the light, where the sun pierced through his hair, tried to surreptitiously brush hair away from his face at night. He was somewhat desperate to know while still fully in denial that he wanted to know, and it was interfering with his life and the packs\u2019.</p>\n<p>So with one final judging look from Scott, he made up his mind and decided to stop caring.</p>\n<p><em>Mostly,</em> he allowed, bundled up with Stiles next to the fire again, and unable to keep his eye from drifting to where he knew that crest was inked in.</p>\n<p>It was right there, Stiles was dead asleep after their long day\u2014now traveling further and faster without the heavier snow to slow them down as much. Everyone else was asleep as well since Stiles was able to put up one of his wards again and no one was on watch anymore... This was Derek\u2019s chance to see.</p>\n<p>And yet he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to do it.</p>\n<p>It felt like a violation, a betrayal, because for all that Stiles had shared with Derek about his life, he\u2019d never once pried into Derek\u2019s. Maybe he just wasn\u2019t interested, maybe he had grander things to focus on, but it still felt like a courtesy that few allowed an alpha. Even Erica had asked and exhausting number of questions at the beginning, wanting to know all about her new alpha and why he was wandering with one beta across the region.</p>\n<p>Stiles respected his privacy, so he would respect Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>And yet, he still found his hand drifting back towards it, brushing gently at the hair covering it.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t going to look, he was just going to...pet Stiles\u2019 head. He hadn\u2019t said it aloud, but Derek knew he secretly enjoyed it, so after a brief hesitation, he gently raked his fingers through the emissary\u2019s hair. Stiles didn\u2019t so much as twitch.</p>\n<p>Though the path was getting easier as they descended the mountain, the wind softer, less snow, Stiles still slept deeply around his nightmares. He was always tired, said he was using more magic than he was used to, which just filled Derek with more guilt. An emissary was supposed to be able to feed off their pack for their magic, but Stiles only had himself and still used everything he had protecting a pack that could give him nothing in return. Unless\u2026</p>\n<p>Derek raked his fingers through again, deeper, watching Stiles\u2019 face carefully for any movement. When he saw none, he did it again, slower this time, trying to make out the path of the faded tattoo underneath. It was hard to tell by only dim firelight, but he could just see the edge...</p>\n<p>His heart sank.</p>\n<p>Whatever was inked there had thin, fine lines\u2014nothing like the thick, black triskele of the Hales.</p>\n<p>Derek brushed the hair back as it was, covering the little he\u2019d seen, refusing to see more. He didn\u2019t need to see more, it just confirmed what he already knew and had been reminding himself of since they met.</p>\n<p>Stiles would be leaving them.</p>\n<p>He sighed sadly, blinking back the burn in his eyes, and carefully pressed his lips to Stiles\u2019 temple, while the emissary slept on, unaware.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>As if the universe knew what he\u2019d done and disapproved, it threw hunters into their path just a day later. They were so close to Stiles\u2019 people, a few days away from the camp, but the universe knew and they would all suffer for it.</p>\n<p>This was probably why he couldn\u2019t have an emissary, Derek realized as they were surrounded by silent figures, all with nocked arrows pointed directly at their eyes, no doubt. Alphas who led their packs directly into ambushes weren\u2019t worthy of emissaries, no matter how good the hunters had become at hiding their presence\u2014and dressed as they were in all black, they could only be hunters. But with the fleur de lis pressed into the clasp on their cloaks, they could only be:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cArgents,\u201d </em>Derek snarled, and he gave in to the rage and grief always simmering under the surface of his skin, gave into the change and let his face shift, nails extend into claws.</p>\n<p>Next to him, Scott did the same, and snarled for good measure. The closest hunter drew back his bow a little further and shifted his aim away from Isaac.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, wait, no!\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice called out from behind them. \u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d he staggered out between the two groups, arms out, fingertips glowing a faint blue, and Derek couldn\u2019t help lurching forward to drag him right back. Stiles saw him move, and used a pulse of magic to keep him back. \u201cAlpha, wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been addressed formally as an alpha. Maybe never, his pack hadn\u2019t had much interaction with the world, too busy moving from place to place and surviving for diplomacy.</p>\n<p>Stiles turned back to the hunters and with his other hand still raised, pulled his scarf and cloak away from his throat to show the tattoos that labeled him an emissary. Emissaries were supposed to be neutral, protected, no hunter would dare strike one. But these were Argents. They\u2019d tried to kill Stiles before. </p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u00c9missaire!\u201d</em> A man\u2019s voice yelled in French, but with their faces covered Derek couldn\u2019t tell which one it was. <em>\u201cIdentifiez votre meute de loups!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cNous sommes la meute Hale,\u201d</em> Stiles responded calmly but firmly. Derek recognized his own name, but couldn\u2019t understand anything else. He\u2019d never given a second thought to learning French; it was the language of the hunters who murdered his family and he wanted nothing to do with it, but now he wished he had.</p>\n<p>It had become such a dirty, twisted language in his mind over the last six years, a language of murderers and psychopaths, but when Stiles spoke it, it sounded beautiful. It sounded like the romantic language everyone else proclaimed it to be.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cLa meute Hale est morte,\u201d</em> the man continued, and judging by his tone, the conversation wasn\u2019t going well. </p>\n<p>Stiles didn\u2019t give an inch. <em>\"Nous sommes juste ici.\"</em></p>\n<p>Someone from the back of the hunters pushed forward through the group, lowering their bow and arrow, but still moving quickly. It was almost threatening how quick and silent they were, and while Stiles didn\u2019t seem worried, Derek certainly was. He took a step forward, preparing, until an awed woman\u2019s voice called out,</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cStiles?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Then Derek\u2019s senses went on full alert, possessive over his emissary and knowing full well it was the Argents who had injured him in the first place. Any of them knowing his name was a bad sign, what if they were hunting him down as the last survivor of the Chevelle pack? It was illegal for hunters to slaughter a pack like that, they would be trying to cover their tracks.</p>\n<p>But Stiles just took a confused step forward. \u201cAllison? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek assumed his switch back to English was for the pack\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p>The woman lowered the scarf from over her mouth, revealing her to be much younger than Derek had thought. Too young to have been a part of his pack\u2019s massacre.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you alive?\u201d She spoke English with a French accent, but didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble with the switch. \u201cWe heard there were no survivors, I thought\u2014\u201d She took a step towards him, but stopped at the five warning growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cPack found me.\u201d Stiles jerked his head back towards the pack. \u201cDo you know what your aunt is doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison\u2019s face fell, suddenly serious. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re trying to intercept her before she reaches the camp.\u201d She paused, eyes wandering over the pack, considering. \u201cWe could use all the help we can get. Her men outnumber us three-to-one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nodded once. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison nodded in return, hesitated a brief moment, like she had more to say, and then turned to guide her hunters away. Stiles didn\u2019t turn his back on them until they were well out of sight.</p>\n<p>As soon as the tension broke, Derek stalked forward, and whipped Stiles around to face him by the shoulder. The rest of the pack quickly found other things to attend to.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowned at him like he was an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m an emissary. I\u2019m emissaring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he shot back, now looking offended at the implication that he couldn\u2019t ruthlessly slaughter an entire pack of innocent wolves. As if Derek should\u2019ve known that from just the wards he\u2019d put down at night and his knowledge of obscure mountain herbs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust them,\u201d Derek practically pleaded. </p>\n<p>\u201cI trust Allison.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek really hated that Stiles had an answer for everything, always did. \u201cThey slaughtered the Chevelle pack. They tried to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a different faction. Allison tried to warn me, but it came too late. They were already in the camp.\u201d And now he was trying to waltz into a hunter\u2019s camp alone. </p>\n<p>Wolves and hunters didn\u2019t enter each other\u2019s camps, and the thought of letting Stiles do just that was going against every instinct Derek had. He didn\u2019t care that it was an emissary\u2019s job to serve as a go-between for packs and hunters, he just wanted Stiles safe.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d lost so many people already, he couldn\u2019t lose Stiles too.</p>\n<p>There was a rumble of frustration building in Derek\u2019s chest, bubbling up to fear and grief threatening to explode out of him. \u201cThey killed my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes turned sad as his hand came up to his shoulder to cover Derek\u2019s, still gripping him desperately, and he said as if it were simple, \u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tried to smile, because Stiles was clearly looking for one, but all he could think was, <em>our emissary died saying the exact same thing.</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>As Derek expected, Stiles went to the Argent camp alone, through the dense forest, and the pack was a mess of anxiety the entire time he was gone. He wasn\u2019t too far, if there were any commotion Derek would be able to hear it, but his heartbeat was out of even his earshot, and Derek couldn\u2019t shake the image of Stiles\u2019 throat silently sliced open before he could even scream.</p>\n<p>The Argents had used that tactic before.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Scott assured them all, but even he wasn\u2019t eating.</p>\n<p>They all kept watch and didn\u2019t relax until a lone pair of familiar footsteps crunched through the snow back towards them, Stiles\u2019 heartbeat calm and even, not a hint of fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all ridiculous,\u201d he informed them fondly, then grabbed Derek\u2019s arm and tugged him back towards their camp for the night. \u201cI\u2019m cold, hunters make weak campfires.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>The two groups traveled separately but together all through the next day, and for the first time in two weeks, Stiles didn\u2019t walk with the pack. He hung back with Allison, the two of them hovering between their people, speaking French in low voices that couldn\u2019t be heard over the crunching of the snow\u2014not that Derek would be able to understand it anyway. It shouldn\u2019t have been loud enough to cover their conversation, but he had a feeling Stiles had done some of his magic to give them privacy.</p>\n<p>Derek hated it.</p>\n<p>Stiles was <em>his,</em> he belonged to their pack, and now the enemy was\u2014</p>\n<p><em>No,</em> no he wasn\u2019t theirs, Derek reminded himself sharply. Stiles wasn\u2019t the Hale emissary, no matter how much they wished he was, or acted like he was, or talked like he was, and they needed to remember that before they got too attached.</p>\n<p>Well, even <em>more</em> attached. Giving up Stiles was already going to ruin them.</p>\n<p>Erica was finally smiling and laughing again, Isaac was talking more, even Boyd\u2019s silence seemed less heavy than it was before, less laden down with grief from his own pack\u2019s demise. Scott was almost...brotherly to Derek again, and he was finally beginning to feel like he could breathe. And now that they were in warmer weather, on a less treacherous road, they were all lighter, the exhausted tension was gone.</p>\n<p>They moved faster, chatted happily, passed the distance with jokes and stories, and before Derek knew it, they were less than a day\u2019s travel from the emissary camp. It was sooner than he\u2019d prepared for, and he wasn\u2019t ready for it to be his last night with Stiles. He wanted their journey to continue indefinitely, as long as they would have each other\u2014in each other\u2019s arms at night, trading kisses under their shared blanket, the hushed sex in back corners that had turned slow and sweet...anything.</p>\n<p>But instead Stiles had spent the day with Allison, and by the time he crawled under the blankets with Derek, he stank of hunter. He must\u2019ve been aware of it though, because he didn\u2019t comment when Derek gave in and began gently rubbing him down under the pretense of warming him up, trying to wipe her scent away with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison thinks her aunt is close,\u201d he said instead, as Derek ran his palm under his shirt, over his side. Over the scar from the Argent arrow. \u201cHer scouts found signs of hunters nearby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek paused, brushing his thumb over the raised and puckered skin, still new and delicate despite Stiles\u2019 magic. \u201cHow close are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few more miles east, in the valley.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been steadily moving down the sloping mountains, overlooking the massive, ancient forest that filled the valley along the river. It made sense to hide there; the mountains on either side were treacherous, as they\u2019d learned firsthand, the forest too dense for a human army to get through, and anyone attacking along the river would be funneled into narrow lines, easy to pick off in small numbers.</p>\n<p>Hunters, on the other hand, were masters of guerrilla warfare. They could disappear into trees, spread out over miles, move silently and hide themselves from even a wolf\u2019s hearing. An emissary camp had never had to worry about that kind of attack before, their neutrality and large part in maintaining balance had always protected them.</p>\n<p>Stiles shivered and inched closer, and Derek could smell his anxiety and worry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there first,\u201d he whispered, though he wanted nothing more than to take Stiles and run in the opposite direction. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinked as if he\u2019d forgotten and then sighed in a surprisingly unenthused tone, \u201cGreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t the tone of someone looking forward to seeing his people, his father. After hearing Isaac\u2019s story, that pinged a warning at the back of Derek\u2019s mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be out with packs.\u201d At Derek\u2019s genuinely baffled expression, because who wouldn\u2019t want a place to call home, he reluctantly continued. \u201cI\u2019m not...normal. There isn\u2019t anyone else like me there.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Of course there isn\u2019t, I\u2019ve never met anyone like you,</em> Derek thought, but Stiles didn\u2019t mean it in a positive way, so he stayed quiet and let him finish.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey think I\u2019m odd. Not natural because I don\u2019t have an alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowned. \u201cBecause your pack was killed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve become a <em>temporary emissary. </em>Because what I do <em>violates the sacred bond.\u201d</em> He was clearly imitating something he\u2019d heard many times in his life and didn\u2019t agree with in the least. \u201cMy pack was killed because I wasn\u2019t ready and they didn\u2019t have an emissary.\u201d He swallowed thickly. \u201cI was trying to, uh, make sure that didn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sniffed and wiped at his face like he was tired, muttering, \u201cGreat job, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rubbed his side comfortingly, dragged his arm up around him and pulled him a little closer. \u201cI know you did everything you could to save them.\u201d </p>\n<p>He was the emissary who selflessly used every last bit of his magic to help keep a tattered and broken pack safe and warm, there was no way he hadn\u2019t worked to help the Chevelle pack until his last moment of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Stiles looked at him sadly, blinked quickly a few times, and angled his face into his arm, then squeezed his eyes shut when that didn\u2019t seem to work.</p>\n<p>Derek pulled him to his chest while he finally cried and shook himself to an exhausted sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>It was easy to tell when they were close to Stiles\u2019 tribe. They crossed through an old, ruined wall snaking through the towering, ancient forest, and like that was the edge of a bubble, the air changed immediately. It grew thicker, almost weighed down with emissary magic, and the birds were quiet as they swooped from tree to tree. As if they knew they had a secret to keep, and any noise would alert enemies to its presence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Isaac asked quietly, crossing his arms over his chest and looking around with concern at the few remaining ruins of a settlement long gone. It felt like they were being watched from all sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s magic,\u201d Derek answered, his own nose twitching against the atmosphere. \u201cThis place reeks of it.\u201d It was sharp and electric, buzzing around them, and it made his hair stand up on end like a lightning storm. </p>\n<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Stiles surreptitiously try to sniff himself, but he needn\u2019t have worried. This was nothing like his magic. Stiles\u2019 magic smelled like rain and felt like the comforting warmth from a fire on a cold night. This was cold and defensive, meant to make anyone turn back to escape it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the first line of defense,\u201d Allison added, coming up beside them. \u201cEmissaries cloak their camps in many spells to keep them hidden. If you didn\u2019t know what it was, you would be turning back here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know a lot about emissary camps,\u201d Derek remarked casually. He still didn\u2019t trust her, expected her to turn on them and attack at any second. </p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t rise to the obvious bait, and instead said mildly, \u201cI know a lot of emissaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how many of them have you killed?\u201d He returned in the same mild tone.</p>\n<p>Her head snapped around to fix him with a hard stare, while Stiles sighed tiredly on her other side. \u201cI am not my aunt, Alpha Hale, and I would never hurt your emissary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinked in surprise, his next scathing retort gone. \u201cHe\u2019s not my\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone in their party yelled and a hunter fell to the ground. There was a beat of shocked silence, during which no one breathed, and then they were surrounded by the unmistakable whistle of arrows whizzing through the air.</p>\n<p>The Argents were already here.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the south! Cover!\u201d Allison yelled, and everyone scattered behind large tree trunks and boulders, pressed to the ground behind the old ruined walls. The hunters had their bows out, ready to fire at anything that moved, but wherever their enemy was, they were well hidden between the trees.</p>\n<p>Derek peeked out around the thick tree he\u2019d chosen, searching for his pack. He could just make out the blonde of Erica\u2019s hair behind her own tree, Boyd was behind a large boulder with a hunter, but he couldn\u2019t find Isaac or Scott.</p>\n<p>He looked the other direction and saw Stiles crouched behind a section of the ruined wall, hand on the ground, eyes glowing blue, staring into nothing again. An arrow thudded into the ground just a foot away from him, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice. His mind was enveloped in magic, and the idiot was going to get himself killed with whatever he was doing.</p>\n<p>Derek cursed, both the universe and Stiles, and darted out towards him, skidding a little in the bit of icy snow that had made it to the ground through the thick canopy of trees.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, what the hell are you doing?\u201d he snapped, pulling the emissary further behind the wall and against his chest, keeping low.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to see where they are,\u201d he murmured, and the blue in his eyes extinguished when he lifted his hand from the earth. \u201cThere\u2019s about thirty, all to the south, ten in the trees. Scott and Isaac made it down to the bank of the river, they\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinked at him. \u201cHow can you know that?\u201d Even he couldn\u2019t distinguish heartbeats so clearly, or know that hunters were firing from the trees.</p>\n<p>Stiles tapped the ground almost fondly. \u201cThe wards. Any emissary can tap into them, they blanket the entire forest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet another aspect of emissary magic Derek didn\u2019t know; he thought they only notified him of an animal crossing the border of it, not specific locations inside. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else can the wards do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty if I can get to the right places,\u201d Stiles responded vaguely, focused on everything else going on around them, eyes darting around. He wasn\u2019t giving Derek the information he needed to help and it was as frustrating as their situation was terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s the right place?\u201d Derek demanded, grabbing Stiles\u2019 arm to get him to focus on their conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout twenty feet that way.\u201d He pointed directly south, where the enemy hunters were firing from. \u201cThere\u2019s a convergence, and if I can get there, I can tap into more magic from the camp.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course. Of course this couldn\u2019t be easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek took a deep breath, making up his mind. \u201cI\u2019ll cause a distraction, get them looking the other way, you get\u2014\u201d </p>\n<p>The twang of an arrow hitting a solid tree interrupted them, and they both turned behind them to look at it. It was still vibrating with the force of the blow, but the fleur de lis carved into its shaft was clear.</p>\n<p>Stiles swore even before he wrenched the arrow out to examine it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, new plan,\u201d he announced, studying the arrowhead carefully. \u201cYou do not get hit with these.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek could smell the wolfsbane on it. He\u2019d survived it before, the important part was getting Stiles and his pack to safety. He tried to explain this, but Stiles cut him off. </p>\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t just wolfsbane arrows,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cThis strain is how they killed the Chevelle pack so quickly. I couldn\u2019t heal them before it reached their heart, and you will die in minutes.\u201d He tossed the arrow far away, as if it could kill Derek from proximity alone. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Derek asked impatiently\u2014not at Stiles, but at their situation. They couldn\u2019t cower behind ruins forever, the hunters would come for them long before they ran out of arrows. \u201cWe can\u2019t move, they\u2019ll pick us off in five seconds.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Stiles was distracted again, eyes wandering over the forest floor. \u201cWe need a cover, something to hide us\u2014ah!\u201d His eyes widened excitedly and Derek felt his heart jump into his throat as Stiles darted out from behind the wall briefly to grab\u2014</p>\n<p>Was that a <em>plant?</em></p>\n<p>Derek grabbed his cloak and yanked him back behind their wall, just as three arrows thudded into the ground where his head had been, kicking up dirt from the impact. He clutched Stiles to him for a second, calming down, before angrily hissing, </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>insane?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stiles pulled away and turned with an excited glint in his eye and a lopsided smile. \u201cProbably, but I just got us our cover.\u201d He held up the entire plant he\u2019d grabbed, roots and all. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to cover your nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek was going to kill him himself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Despite Stiles\u2019 warning, Derek wasn\u2019t even close to prepared for the assault on his senses that was the emissary's smoke screen. Even with his cloak pulled over his face, it wormed its way up into his nostrils and it <em>burned, </em>it stank, it was actually painful to breathe in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles was murmuring, continuing to nudge his small fire to produce even more smoke. </p>\n<p>Whatever plant he\u2019d found and added to the tiny, weak flame he managed to create on dampened wood, it turned that tiny wisp of delicately curling smoke into giant, billowing clouds that filled the forest around them. Derek could hear people coughing from both sides, trying to find each other and regroup, and his own betas were whispering for each other, sounding scared. They had no way of knowing this was Stiles\u2019 work.</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t understand how a few leaves could produce this much smoke, but anytime it started to taper off, Stiles\u2019 fingers would glow the soft blue of his magic, and another cloud would billow forth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you hear them?\u201d Stiles asked, nodding his head towards the enemy hunters.</p>\n<p>Derek closed his eyes against the sting of the smoke and strained his hearing past his pack and Allison\u2019s hunters. They were moving around, a woman was issuing short and angry orders in French, and when he tried to repeat her words, Stiles translated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re about to advance with blades.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek could work with that. \u201cWe can go out and meet them. My pack will have the advantage with our hearing and strength.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles nodded, and gave the fire one last pulse of magic before unwrapping his scarf from around his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find Allison, tell her to prepare. How\u2019s the smell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot great.\u201d Derek frowned as the emissary started to rip his scarf into thick strips. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hunters all have scarves for this very reason, we\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u201c Stiles shoved the strips of fabric at him, and then tied another over his nose and mouth. Masks for Derek and his pack, now saturated in Stiles\u2019 scent to help block out the smoke. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s the best I can do right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hurried to tie one on, watching silently as Stiles pressed his palm to the earth again. His eyes glowed blue over his mask as he stared off into nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re starting to move, but they\u2019re leaving archers in the trees,\u201d he announced, and blinked away the magic, his clear, bright eyes on Derek now. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the archers, you get your pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Derek didn\u2019t have complete faith in his abilities, but everything he\u2019d seen from Stiles\u2019 magic so far was offensive, and he didn\u2019t exactly have a bow and arrow on his person.</p>\n<p>Stiles just winked. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pressed a firm kiss to Derek\u2019s lips through their masks that felt like a goodbye, and then darted off towards the south, his fingertips already glowing his magic\u2019s soft blue as he disappeared into the smoke.</p>\n<p>Derek swore, but turned towards where he knew Erica and Boyd were. Stiles had given them a way to fight back, and they couldn\u2019t waste it.</p>\n<p>He cocked his head around, letting his neck crack as he felt the shift coming over him, then he tipped his head back, and roared for his pack.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>They made quick work of the hunters on the ground. Derek\u2019s pack led the way forward through the smoke, carefully following the footsteps and quick heartbeats of their enemies. They moved quickly, incapacitating them with one blow before moving onto the next while Allison and her hunters moved more slowly behind them, finishing them off.</p>\n<p>By the time the smoke was starting to clear away and lessen their advantage, they\u2019d almost plowed through the lot of them, with only a few heartbeats on the ground remaining.</p>\n<p>Derek lashed out, catching a man across the chest at the same Boyd snapped another\u2019s neck. A hunter\u2019s training was no match for the natural stealth and strength of a born wolf when they fought in close quarters. They just couldn't let them gain any distance.</p>\n<p>He wondered how Stiles was doing with the remaining archers; amid the chaos in the smoke, it was difficult for him to let his hearing wander anywhere else. He couldn\u2019t afford to, he had to keep his focus on the hunters before and around him, on his pack. He heard Erica snarl somewhere off to his right, but it was triumphant rather than from pain or fear, and he caught occasional glimpses of Scott fighting through the smoke. </p>\n<p>They were actually winning, he realized somewhat distantly. These were the hunters who had killed Derek\u2019s pack, slaughtered the Chevelles and left Stiles to die\u2014and their ragged and fractured pack with their hunter allies were winning. </p>\n<p>Even as he had nodded along with the plan, followed Stiles into the forest, Derek had expected to die here. He had accepted it on some level, how could he not when he was facing the demons who defeated even Talia Hale? Derek had never been a strong fighter, but he was willing to give it all for the chance to avenge his family and save Stiles\u2019 people, and yet, they were winning.</p>\n<p>They were still winning right up to the end, when the last clouds of smoke drifted into the trees and only three hunters remained standing through the haze in opposition. There were no arrows shooting down from the trees, and Derek couldn\u2019t hear any heartbeats up there, but he was completely focused on those in front of him.</p>\n<p>He heard footsteps behind him as Allison moved to the front to stand even with him, an arrow already drawn and ready to fly.</p>\n<p>\u201cKate, you have to stop,\u201d she ordered, and an older woman with dark blonde hair coming loose from a braid raised her sword almost casually. She didn\u2019t look concerned with suddenly being so outnumbered, surrounded by wolves, with her own niece holding a nocked arrow aimed directly at her eye.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cMa petite Allison,\u201d </em>she sighed, and even Derek understood that much. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything. <em>Marcus!\u201d</em> She called back over her shoulder, smirking as her voice echoed through the trees.</p>\n<p>Derek braced himself, ready to dive for cover, and felt everyone around him do the same for whatever terrible attack was coming. But seconds crept by and nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Kate\u2019s smirk fell slightly, her heart started to beat just a little bit faster; she was concerned and trying to hide it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDurant!\u201d She yelled again.</p>\n<p>This was clearly not going to plan for her, because the only thing that happened was that the massive trees started to sway in the wind. Actually, only one of the was swaying, Derek realized once he turned his attention to it. Unnaturally.</p>\n<p>He focused his gaze up towards the middle, where the thicker branches were high enough for an archer to have a vantage point, and saw who he assumed was Durant, clinging to the almost violently swaying tree with wide eyes. </p>\n<p>Because there at the base was Stiles, eyes glowing blue through the weak remaining haze of smoke and his glowing palm pressed against the trunk of the tree. His eyes glowed brighter for a moment, and Durant yelled as he finally dropped from his perch. </p>\n<p>Kate whipped around at the thud of his body, and she snarled like the very wolves she hunted.</p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u00c9missaire,\u201d</em> she growled, though Stiles wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her as far away as he was. He just dusted the bark from his hands and glanced over the body of the archer.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Kate,\u201d Allison called to her, voice cracking a little at the end though her arrow never wavered. \u201cDrop your sword.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kate paused, not turning back around while everyone else seemed to hold their breath, waiting for what she would do next. She seemed to be thinking over her options, staring down Stiles in the distance, whose eyes had faded back to brown. The last time she saw him, he was bleeding out among the bodies of a slaughtered pack.</p>\n<p>Then she slowly raised the sword out next to her, her other hand spread in surrender.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cNe tire pas, Allison, je me rends,\u201d </em>she practically crooned as she turned slowly and started to kneel to place the sword on the ground. <em>\u201cJe ne vais plus me battre.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Allison huffed in angry disbelief. \u201cI\u2019ve known you my entire life. I know better than to believe that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kate just smiled innocently. It was a smile that put Derek on edge even more, that showed no remorse for what she\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>Allison finally lowered her bow to step forward and officially take Kate into custody, but despite the archers still ready and waiting, the wolves spread out around her, it gave her the opening she needed.</p>\n<p>In a split second she grabbed a forgotten bow from the ground, slid an arrow out of her thigh holster, and whipped back around. Derek moved, faster than he ever had, but just before his claws ripped through her back, she fired, and Stiles dropped to the ground.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>They followed Stiles\u2019 bleary directions the rest of the way to the camp, Derek holding him close in his arms as he ran, siphoning off the pain of a fresh, new arrow wound. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Stiles kept insisting weakly. \u201cThe wolfsbane won\u2019t kill me, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the arrow will,\u201d Derek hissed back, pushing himself to run faster.</p>\n<p>Stiles managed to hold onto consciousness long enough to get them to his people, to point out the entrance to their camp, then his eyes closed and didn\u2019t open again.</p>\n<p>The camp\u2019s entrance was a large, half-ruined archway of a once ornate stone building. From outside, it looked like an empty clearing beyond it, but once they passed through, a sea of tents and chaos materialized through the wards. People immediately swarmed them, first speaking frantic Polish until they realized Derek couldn\u2019t understand, then switching to English to demand answers for what was happening in their forest, who they were, how they found the camp, what happened to Stiles.</p>\n<p>One man was particularly distraught, trying to pull Stiles from Derek\u2019s arms, speaking angry and demanding Polish as if Derek himself were responsible for what happened. He didn\u2019t stop until Scott stepped into to speak with him in his own language.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Stiles\u2019 father, John,\u201d Scott explained. \u201cHe thought Stiles was killed with the Chevelles.\u201d</p>\n<p>No wonder he was upset.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him Stiles needs a healer and that he\u2019s been shot with a wolfsbane arrow.\u201d Derek refused to believe Stiles would be anything but alright. He\u2019d survived this type of wound before on his own, he could do it again.</p>\n<p>Scott relayed the message, and immediately, John was pulling them further into the camp.</p>\n<p>Derek was allowed to carry Stiles into one of many tents, lay him out carefully on a cot, and then he was immediately banished to wander the streets of the camp, unsure of what to do or if he should even stay in the area. Scott was still with Stiles, translating what had happened and telling them about the Argents, but Derek had nothing to do.</p>\n<p>The others in the tribe certainly weren\u2019t very welcoming, understandably\u2014wolves weren\u2019t supposed to even know their location, and now an alpha was walking down the main road. Everywhere he went he was surrounded by stares and frantically whispered Polish he still couldn\u2019t understand, but he could tell it wasn\u2019t positive.</p>\n<p>He was a threat to their safety and he\u2019d come to them with Stiles, who they apparently considered odd and unnatural, simply for doing whatever he could to help the most people. It filled Derek with rage, knowing <em>these people</em> who didn\u2019t appreciate him got to have Stiles, while Derek\u2019s pack would have to leave him behind. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned to see Isaac waving him over to a tent on the edge of the camp.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey gave us this tent for the night,\u201d he explained as Derek approached. \u201cThey expect to hear about Stiles before morning so at least we\u2019ll know...either way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just nodded tightly and pushed through the front flap. Erica and Boyd were already inside, gathered around the small fire at the center, but it still smelled nothing like their pack. Nothing like Stiles. Just foreign scents that set him on edge.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>His arms felt empty that night, lying under furs and blankets that were too hot for him, but just perfect for Stiles. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to throw them off though; he\u2019d grown used to the weight of them and the excess heat of Stiles' body. To the feeling of him pressed up against him. To the scent of him surrounding him completely.</p>\n<p>Now he could only smell the smoke screen lingering over all of them, clinging to their clothing. It had seeped into Derek\u2019s beard right beneath his nose, and no matter how many times he brushed his hands through it, the stench wouldn\u2019t fade. It was everywhere, even on the blankets he and Stiles had been using, and it felt like Stiles had been erased by it.</p>\n<p>It wasn't just Derek either, the whole pack slept ill at ease with Stiles out of sight, which he realized wasn\u2019t good. Stiles wasn\u2019t their emissary, he was only with them <em>temporarily,</em> and he had countless other packs to aid after them. They couldn\u2019t get so attached.</p>\n<p>Besides, they were crippled and piecemeal, had no emissary, the deteriorating remnants of a great and powerful pack. What could they possibly offer an emissary of Stiles' skill? Nothing as they were, that was for sure, they didn\u2019t even have a territory to call home.</p>\n<p>Well, they did, Derek could at least admit that much to himself. His family\u2019s land lay empty and forgotten to the west, but the thought of returning to their improvised burial ground\u2026 He shuddered at the dark memories stirred up in his mind, and was horrified at the instinct to reach for Stiles for comfort. They\u2019d all come to rely on him too much. </p>\n<p>They needed to move on, forget about him, learn to live and be strong without him. It wasn\u2019t fair to his pack to keep them wandering forever, chasing a dream Derek didn\u2019t want to let go. They deserved a home, security, somewhere to build a life. He may never have Stiles, may never be able to give them an emissary, but he could at least give them a home.</p>\n<p>They would head west at dawn, he decided, no matter what Stiles\u2019 condition. It was time to stop running.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>There was no word on Stiles at dawn. His father was nowhere to be found, nor was the healer Deaton, and no one else seemed to want to associate with the wolves in their midst to answer their questions. Emissaries weren\u2019t even supposed to associate with other packs before they were bonded, and it seemed as though the whole tribe followed that as law. Children would approach curiously, their heads shaved, foreign crests on display, but an adult would always come pull them away quickly.</p>\n<p>The pack was left alone to gather their things for their trip west, pack the supplies given to them in thanks. Derek hadn\u2019t told them where they were headed yet; he wanted to discuss it with Scott in private instead of surprising him with an audience and they hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to talk yet.</p>\n<p>None of them said anything as they closed their borrowed tent and headed out, through the camp towards the entrance, past the covered bodies of Allison\u2019s hunters lost against Kate\u2019s. Each blanket had a bundle of flowers on it, what looked like a family symbol etched into a metal medallion. Derek didn\u2019t know Stiles\u2019 family symbol, didn\u2019t want to know if they were walking past his body. He would much rather believe that Stiles was out there in the world, helping packs and saving lives.</p>\n<p>Scott caught his eye, and though he looked understanding, Derek could tell he wanted to stay longer. Say goodbye like they hadn\u2019t been able to with their own pack, even if it was at a grave.</p>\n<p>But Derek couldn\u2019t do it again. He didn\u2019t want to know.</p>\n<p>He hiked up his bag further on his back, and kept moving. If he stopped, he would break, and he couldn\u2019t break when his pack was relying on him to get them home.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha!\u201d</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes at whoever was calling them back. Of course they couldn\u2019t let this be easy. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd nudged him, and he turned reluctantly to see a man jogging up behind him, a little unevenly, and Derek had to look again to confirm that it really was Stiles he was looking at\u2014still injured. But now he wore the hairstyle Derek had always seen on emissaries; the sides of his head shorn away but the top still kept long, showing the symbol of his pack tucked partially behind his ear. Derek froze, his chest tightened.</p>\n<p>The mark in Stiles\u2019 hair mirrored that on Derek\u2019s back, three interconnecting spirals: Hale.</p>\n<p>\"Derek...\" Scott started, having seen the same thing, but Derek didn't wait for whatever he was about to say. He crossed the distance in three strides, and heard Stiles' heart tick up in anticipation as he reverently brushed his palm over the fresh tattoo and cupped the back of his head, pulling him in for a bruising kiss.</p>\n<p>Stiles could stay with them, he was <em>meant</em> to stay with them.</p>\n<p><em>No,</em> Derek pulled back, trying to rein in his happiness. He\u2019d seen Stiles\u2019 tattoo before, and it was nothing like the triskele; he could still see the faint, fading remnants of it underneath his buzzed hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do this.\u201d It hurt to say the words, but he had to stop this. </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face fell, and he was still breathing heavily. Still injured, holding his side. \u201cI thought you wanted\u2014Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s chest clenched. \u201cYes, Stiles, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He put his hands on Stiles\u2019 shoulders, holding him at arm\u2019s length so he could think. \u201cYou can\u2019t force this. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the few things his mother had managed to teach him was that the alpha-emissary bond could never be forced. Both parties would suffer, the pack would slowly die as the magic tried to correct itself, but the emissary would suffer the brunt of the consequences. Emissaries were the conduit pack magic flowed through, and a forced, cancerous bond would eat them away inside. He couldn\u2019t do that to Stiles, no matter how selfishly he wanted to keep him.</p>\n<p>Stiles narrowed his eyes. \u201cDerek, I\u2019m not forcing it, this is supposed to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it's not.\u201d He sighed, finally admitting, \u201cI saw your mark, before. I know you\u2019re not mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Stiles argued, getting defensive. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how or why it happened, but this is meant to be, because I\u2019m your emissary.\u201d His voice was hard and determined, and Derek took a deep, frustrated breath, willing himself to stay strong. No matter how much he wanted Stiles to be with them, be with him, he wasn\u2019t going to let them destroy themselves for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\" Derek's voice was rough as he shook his head. \"You just want to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Stiles looked outright offended. \u201cDo you really think I would risk ruining a pack, possibly killing them, just because I want to be in one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hated himself a little as he honestly answered, \u201cMaybe not consciously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opened his mouth to argue, closed it, frowned, squinted at him, then asked curiously, \u201cDo you even know how we find our packs?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinked at the sudden change in topic, still geared up to argue and scraped raw by everything happening. \u201cMy mother told me you go into a trance and the crest comes to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. Our mentor seeks it out <em>for us,</em> I <em>can\u2019t</em> force myself to choose anyone. Deaton saw it while he was healing me last night, and he would kill himself before letting anyone here force a bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stared. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut your\u2014\u201d Derek\u2019s mind was a whirlwind, trying to force himself to think clearly somewhere between the stark refusal to believe this was true and the sheer joy and relief at the news. \u201cYour pack died,\u201d he finally managed, and congratulated himself on staying somewhat focused while faced with Stiles wearing his family\u2019s crest like he belonged.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I have another.\u201d He tugged down his scarf to reveal the two wolves on his throat. \u201cYou were right; two alphas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tightened his grip on Stiles\u2019 shoulders, trying to strengthen his resolve and not shove his face right up against those wolves, cover the stench of foreign magic and this place with pack. This was too good to be true. Derek didn\u2019t get what he wanted, he didn\u2019t get happiness. He didn\u2019t get someone like Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you liked the symmetry,\u201d he protested weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was already enough of a freak growing up, I wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone that not even Deaton knew what it meant that I had two.\u201d</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t a hint of a lie as Stiles smiled at him softly, and Derek gave in. He moved his hands up Stiles\u2019 shoulders to cover the wolves with his palms and let the comforting, warm hum of magic sing through his veins as if it were a full moon. Stiles\u2014<em>his emissary</em>\u2014stood there with an alpha\u2019s claws so close to his throat and his heart didn\u2019t so much as stutter, with nothing but trust and, if Derek allowed himself to hope, maybe love in his eyes.</p>\n<p>He pulled his emissary in for another kiss and let his hand creep up to cover the triskele, let the magic crackle through them and out through the pack bonds into his betas. He could <em>feel</em> them, he could feel all of them as an alpha should, feel that they were happy and healthy and ready to find a home.</p>\n<p>With their emissary.</p>\n<p>\"You're mine.\" That was all he managed to get out, breathless and a little strangled with shock that he got to have this. </p>\n<p>Stiles smiled against his lips. \"And you're mine.\"</p>"
