  "notes": "<p><a href=\"https://wordswrittenovercoffee.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">wordswrittenovercoffee</a> said:<br>I was marathoning Friends last night when I couldn't sleep, and it was when Chandler falls for kathy, Joey's girlfriend, has a minor freak out and just writhes in jealousy because Joey doesn't appreciate her properly but he can't do anything about it. I was thinking, not really a Friends AU, but maybe college/post college, with Stiles and Erica as bros rooming together, and she meets Derek and immediately needs to hit that... It just sucks that Derek is perfect for Stiles in every way. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>So, it's not QUITE that. But I hope it's close enough to pass? Like, with at least a D, if not a C-? Um.

  "text": "<p>\"I hope you don't mind that I took a shower,\" said a distracted, vaguely familiar male voice from the doorway. </p>\n<p>Stiles turned around to face the voice, bag of coffee beans in hand, and promptly dropped the bag to the kitchen floor with a dull thud. A few beans escaped the partially-opened flap, and they skittered across the red tiles as if fleeing for their lives. Not that Stiles gave a fuck about fugitive coffee beans. He was far too concerned with the sight before him.</p>\n<p>Standing in the kitchen doorway, obviously fresh from the shower and garbed only in a damp towel, stood the hottest guy Stiles had ever met in his life. More importantly, Stiles knew this guy. Well, not <i>knew</i> knew. They weren't, like, friends or anything. But this was 8:15 AM, triple grande salted caramel latte guy. This was the customer he had fallen in lust at first sight with on his second day on the job three months ago. Stiles even knew his name, since he'd had to write it on the cup so many times. This was <i>Derek</i>.</p>\n<p>Derek, who was looking at him in shock and alarm, hands quickly grabbing at the slipping towel and Adam's apple working as he swallowed. \"You. You're not... You're um. Wait.\" He blinked those damn gorgeous eyes of his and took a step into the kitchen, recognition dawning on his face. \"No fucking way,\" he whispered, as if talking to himself. \"What are <i>you</i> doing here?\"</p>\n<p>\"You know me?\" Stiles squawked, before clearing his throat and trying again with a voice more his usual timbre. \"I mean, yeah, right, I think I've seen you at the coffee shop before. A time or two, maybe.\"</p>\n<p>Bushy brows coming down low over his eyes, Derek took yet another step into the kitchen. \"I go there every day. You say my order to me before I even make it to the register.\"</p>\n<p>Stiles gave a nervous little laugh and made a big deal out of discovering the bag of coffee on the floor, then retrieving it and turning to set it on the counter. \"Ah, yeah. Yeah, I think I remember now. You, um, look different...with clothes.\"</p>\n<p>It was Derek's turn to clear his throat, and Stiles heard him take a few steps back towards the hall. \"Speaking of, maybe I should...yeah. Okay.\"</p>\n<p>Stiles bit his lip, then spun around and called out to Derek before the guy could disappear back into Erica's bedroom, where he undoubtedly had stayed the night (certainly hadn't stayed in <i>Stiles'</i> bed, that's for damn sure, which was a pity). \"I'm gonna make some breakfast. You, er, want some?\"</p>\n<p>Derek popped his head back into the doorway, looking startled again. \"I. Um. Yeah. Sounds good.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good. You like eggs and bacon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Love 'em.\"</p>\n<p>\"Great!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"So. Um. You should probably go get dressed now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Oh, right. Yes. Be right back.\"</p>\n<p>Once Derek had vanished again, Stiles sagged back against the counter and let out a shaky breath. What the fuck kind of day was he going to have, if <i>this</i> was his morning?</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>\"You know, I'm feeling sort of swindled in this. I mean, here I am cooking the Morning After breakfast, and I didn't even get to experience the fun part.\" Belatedly realizing how his words could be taken, Stiles turned to face the tiny kitchen table where Derek was sitting. Derek was just biting his lip as if trying not to laugh, so Stiles cleared his throat and returned his attention to the eggs in the pan. </p>\n<p>\"So, where and how did you and Erica meet?\" Stiles asked as if he really wanted to know.</p>\n<p>\"A friend of a friend's get together. My sisters have been hounding me to get out and mingle, and my friend Isaac thought he'd help out by literally dragging me there.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, hey, at least it wasn't all bad, right?\" Stiles aimed for levity, but his smile hurt and his laugh felt a bit forced. He was going to have <i>words</i> with Erica later. So many words.</p>\n<p>When Derek replied, his voice was surprisingly soft and gentle. \"No, not bad at all.\" Glancing over at the man, Stiles saw him staring back with a tiny smile playing on his lips and his eyes sparkling. Fucking <i>sparkling</i>. Stiles didn't even know eyes really <i>did</i> that outside cheesy romance stories.</p>\n<p>\"Food's ready!\" Piling two plates full of bacon and eggs, Stiles hurried over to the table. \"I know it's not a sugary breakfast pastry, but hopefully you'll be able to make do.\" He flashed a teasing grin at Derek and was pleased to get a chuckle in response.</p>\n<p>\"Hey now, pumpkin bread is almost like eating a vegetable, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is a pumpkin a vegetable or a fruit, though? I mean, it's the nutrient-rich container for the seeds, and not just an edible part of a plant, so I'm pretty sure it'd be considered a fruit?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\" Derek asked eloquently, his lips wrapped around a forkful of yolky eggs as he blinked at Stiles. His lips were smeared a glistening yellow, and it wasn't fair that even <i>that</i> was sexy on this guy. After slowly chewing and swallowing his mouthful, Derek licked his lips and said, \"Okay, then so it's considered eating a fruit.\"</p>\n<p>Stiles had gotten derailed when Derek had licked his lips, though, so he honestly had no idea what they were even talking about anymore. \"Huh? What is?\"</p>\n<p>\"Pumpkin bread.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Considered the same as eating some fruit.\"</p>\n<p>\"What? No way. That's like saying eating the lemon pound cake is like eating fruit.\"</p>\n<p>Derek snorted and smiled down at his plate. \"I'm sure an all-protein breakfast isn't much better. Not that I'm complaining, of course. It's delicious and a wonderful change from my usual.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know, right! Just don't tell my dad. I'm always trying to get him to eat healthy, and in doing so have vowed to try to do so, as well, so we can live longer lives in misery together.\"</p>\n<p>\"Misery?\"</p>\n<p>\"I miss pizza.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. Well, that's understandable. I don't think I could live without pizza.\"</p>\n<p>Nodding emphatically, Stiles swallowed his bite of bacon. \"It's pretty much the closest thing to experiencing heaven while still alive.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really? I'd say sex was.\"</p>\n<p>In an effort to not let that line affect him, Stiles scoffed and crunched on another piece of bacon before replying. \"Evidently you've not had the right pizza, my man.\" He quickly shoveled a heaping spoonful of eggs into his mouth to make himself shut the fuck up.</p>\n<p>Derek smirked around his own bite of bacon, before swallowing and saying with a voice that was totally <i>not fair</i>, \"I think it's more that you haven't been having the right sex.\"</p>\n<p>He hadn't finished chewing before he swallowed all that egg, and his eyes watered a bit as he nearly choked on it. \"I call foul! The guy who scored the night before doesn't get to mock the woefully lacking sex life of the guy who didn't. That's just cruel.\"</p>\n<p>Fork paused halfway to his mouth, Derek gave Stiles an incredulous look. \"You're shitting me. There's no way you're single.\"</p>\n<p>\"Um, what?\" What was that boy smoking, because <i>what</i>?</p>\n<p>\"What about that blond girl at the coffee shop?\"</p>\n<p>What was even happening? Were they really having this conversation? \"Who, Heather? Okay, no. First of all, it is fucking stupid as hell to date a coworker, and that is a personal policy of mine that I always enforce. Secondly, Heather has been seriously dating some guy for over a year. Like, I fully expect her to walk in with a honking diamond on her finger any day now. Well maybe not a <i>huge</i> diamond, since her guy's still pretty low on the food chain at his company. But you get the point.\"</p>\n<p>Derek just stared at him, food totally forgotten, with a look as if Stiles had just flipped his entire world upside-down. \"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, oh. So, no, not dating Heather. Not dating anyone, sadly enough. We should totally change the subject, because no one should think depressing things at the start of the day. Where are you from?\"</p>\n<p>It took a few seconds for Derek to catch up, but then he was suddenly smiling and poking at his eggs in a manner that one could almost consider shy. If, that is, someone could ever think such a fucking perfect specimen of embodied hotness had the ability to actually <i>be</i> shy. \"Not far from here, actually. A place called Beacon Hills, about an hour north-west.\"</p>\n<p>\"Get the fuck out, no way! Me, too!\"</p>\n<p>Derek's head shot up, and if anything his smile seemed to grow. \"Really?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, man! My dad's the sheriff, actually.\"</p>\n<p>\"No shit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yup. Sheriff John Stilinski.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your name is Stiles Stilinski?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nickname, dude. Trust me, you do <i>not</i> want to know what the real name is. It's really better for all of humanity if I never use it. It's a name that should just die and be buried somewhere deep and covered in cement.\"</p>\n<p>Derek laughed, and Stiles felt like maybe he could fall more than in lust with the man. \"Good of you to save humanity by using a nickname, then.\"</p>\n<p>\"What can I say? I'm a regular humanitarian.\" He felt Derek's foot nudge against his own beneath the table, and the man was staring at him with such a warm smile on his face. Part of Stiles wanted to believe there was some interest there, some subtle flirting and inviting signals, but the rational side of his brain pointed out how totally ridiculous that was. Derek had just spent the night with Erica, so why would he be flirting with Stiles? When one had a blond bombshell ready and willing to take a tumble in the sheets, one did not usually pass it up for lanky grad students with a tendency to ramble.</p>\n<p>Beneath the table, Derek's foot slid further along Stiles' own, until their calves were pressed softly together. \"What are the odds that two Beacon Hillians would find each other in this city?\"</p>\n<p>\"Beacon Hillians?\" Stiles laughed, trying to ignore the press of leg-on-leg and the glances and the continued smiling.</p>\n<p>\"Well this looks cozy.\" Erica's amused voice had Stiles jerking back in his chair so quickly he nearly toppled backwards. The only thing that saved him was Derek catching the chair by hooking his foot in the cross bar between the two front legs. When the chair slammed back down on all fours, Stiles' fork fell from his hand and clattered onto his plate, sending bits of egg splattering onto the tabletop. Erica snorted at the display and sauntered into the kitchen towards the refrigerator. Judging by her outfit, she had obviously been out jogging, and Stiles tried not to be jealous over the fact that his friend looked smokin' hot when she should have looked all gross and sweaty. </p>\n<p>\"Mornin',\" she greeted with a sly smile slanted Derek's way. \u201cI see <i>someone\u2019s</i> in a good mood.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek ducked his head and continued eating, but Stiles could see the smile he was trying to hide around each mouthful. When the tips of Derek\u2019s ears turned red, Stiles could take no more. He stood suddenly from the table, his chair screeching its protest against the tiles. \u201cWell, this has been lovely, but I have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica gave him a weird look over the bottle of juice she\u2019d just been rudely drinking directly from. \u201cYou don\u2019t have class today, and you\u2019re off work.\u201d To the last part, she hooked a thumb at the work schedule Stiles had stuck to the front of the fridge with a line of magnet poetry that read \u201cintrepid zombies swim in purple dreams of goddess brains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStudy group,\u201d Stiles responded with an absent shrug as he tossed the remainder of his breakfast and put his plate in the sink. \u201cBig exam coming up, and so a few of us were going to review together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean watch C.S.I.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stuck his tongue out at Erica. \u201cThat was <i>one</i> time. And Trevor is no longer in charge of our study sessions. Mostly because he has finally flunked out of the class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d asked Derek, causing Stiles to pause on his way out and slowly turn back to face the rest of the kitchen. He had been trying valiantly to ignore Derek in order to make a relatively painless exit. So much for that idea.</p>\n<p>Biting his lip, Stiles looked at Derek\u2019s shoulder instead of his stupidly pretty eyes. \u201cThis time specifically, or in general?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek--damn him--shifted so that Stiles accidentally made eye contact, which was then nearly impossible to break. \u201cIn general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing for my masters in criminal justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica was suddenly right behind Derek\u2019s chair, running her fingers playfully through his hair. \u201cStiles wants to be a police detective.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was such a warmth to the smile that brought to Derek\u2019s face, and Stiles could feel himself slipping even further into the Danger Zone. \u201cSo law enforcement must be in the blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Stiles gave an artfully careless shrug. \u201cSomething like that. Well. Um. I gotta go, so...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mind giving Derek a ride?\u201d Erica practically purred, her fingers now scritching at Derek\u2019s scalp as if he were a fucking puppy. \u201cI drove us here last night, so his car is still at Boyd\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of snapping that Erica should give him a ride back her own damn self, Stiles just swallowed again and nodded. \u201cYeah, sure, no problem. Boyd\u2019s is on my way.\u201d It was odd, however, how much that made Erica grin, and how Derek looked downright hopeful.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for giving me a ride,\u201d said Derek, as he made absolutely no move to undo his seatbelt and exit the vehicle. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo prob, man. Anytime.\u201d Seriously. Stiles had enjoyed the hell out of their brief drive. It was like as soon as they were away from Erica, all the awkwardness melted away and they were just like they had been over breakfast, all friendly chatter and teasing jokes. It was really quite nice, and Stiles was kind of sad to see it end so soon.</p>\n<p>Derek was still just sitting there, gaze flicking over Stiles\u2019 face, when finally he licked his lips and asked, \u201cSo, how long do your study sessions tend to last?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeh,\u201d Stiles said with a toss of his hand, \u201cthey tend to vary. I doubt this one will last more than a few hours, max. No matter what, though, I\u2019m totally going to make sure I get back in time for the game tonight. Mets versus the Giants, man. Can\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grinning wide, Derek nodded in emphatic agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be epic. The Giants are going to wipe the floor with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looked at Derek with exaggerated affront. \u201cGet the fuck out of my car, you heathen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeathen?\u201d laughed Derek, eyebrows raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour taste in baseball teams is deplorable. I can\u2019t have you sitting there, dirtying up my front seat with your shamefulness.\u201d And, whoa, Stiles <i>really</i> needed to work on word choice.</p>\n<p>Derek just laughed harder, but he finally unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out of the Jeep. \u201cIt was really great talking with you, Stiles,\u201d he said, leaning against the doorframe and grinning like a gorgeous idiot. </p>\n<p>Stiles swallowed and cleared his throat. \u201cYeah. Same. We should, um, do it again sometime. Talk. And stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Then, before Stiles could process whether or not Derek\u2019s voice was flirtatious or just friendly, he was closing the door and walking away towards a totally fucking <i>sweet</i> Camaro.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my god,\u201d Stiles muttered under his breath, trying to get himself to calm the fuck down and stop acting like some silly high school kid with a crush. As he started to pull away, he was sure he caught Derek glancing at him over his shoulder with a little smirk.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. Erica\u2019s not...here.\u201d Stiles stood in the entryway of his apartment, staring at what had to be a figment of his imagination standing in the open doorway. Because, really, there was no way that Derek was back again so soon (was it really just this morning that they\u2019d hung out?), standing at his door with two six packs of expensive craft beer, and a T-shirt so tight it should be fucking <i>illegal</i>.</p>\n<p>Derek raised his eyebrows and stared at Stiles expectantly, as if waiting for him to say something else. So, Stiles licked his lips and continued with, \u201cBut would you like to come in and hang out? The game\u2019s about to start. We can watch your team get murdered by my team. It\u2019ll be great fun. There\u2019s a toll, though, to pass through this doorway, and that toll is at least one of those tasty looking fancy beers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Derek offered, holding one of the packs up for Stiles to take. \u201cI got two different kinds, because I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d like lager or stout.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, but you are just too perfect to be true. Seriously. Come in, you magnificent bastard, and have a seat while I order a pizza. Any preferences?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grinned wide and feral as he slid past Stiles in the narrow entryway. \u201cMeat lover, myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan after my own fucking heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t allowed to eat pizza anymore, though,\u201d Derek called over his shoulder as he wandered over to the couch. </p>\n<p>\u201cToday is a cheat day already, so I thought why not, ya know?\u201d Stiles tore his eyes away from Derek\u2019s ass and forced himself to focus on his phone. It was a cheat day as far as <i>food</i>, he had to remind himself, not as far as his roommate\u2019s hot new boyfriend.</p>\n<p>That night was the best Stiles had experienced in years, and the realization was bittersweet. Every time one of them would cheer smugly over his team\u2019s awesome play, they almost seemed to drift closer on the couch. He devoured every expression Derek displayed, stored them all away in a special place so he could melt over them later. </p>\n<p>It was stupid, he knew. </p>\n<p>Even so, he couldn\u2019t help but let himself at least partly believe that this was something more than two new friends hanging out. Derek would touch his shoulder or arm or even leg, and Stiles\u2019 heart would slam against his ribs harder than when he watched the players run the bases. </p>\n<p>Several beers deep, and Stiles couldn\u2019t help but lean in a bit too much, be just as touchy as Derek, with touches that maybe lingered a tad bit longer. When the Mets ultimately claimed victory, Stiles jumped to his feet to do a victory dance, and immediately fell back to the couch with all the coordination and grace of one who\u2019s tipsy on expensive beer. Derek broke his fall, laughing and running large, strong hands over Stiles in an effort to position him a in way that didn\u2019t result in knees and elbows jabbing sensitive areas. </p>\n<p>Somehow that resulted in Stiles straddling Derek\u2019s lap, their laughter melting slowly to warm puffs of air on each other\u2019s lips. Part of Stiles\u2019 brain told him to move, to get off, that this was dangerous and wrong and <i>think of Erica</i>. But the rest of his brain was caught on the way that Derek was staring at his lips, and how the tip of a pink tongue peeked out to moisten Derek\u2019s own lips. </p>\n<p>\u201cErica will probably be home soon,\u201d Stiles heard himself say. </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hands seemed to flinch where they gripped his hips. \u201cYeah. I should probably get going, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinked and shook his head, confused. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to see her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can catch up later. Not a big deal.\u201d His thumbs felt almost like they were caressing small circles on Stiles\u2019 sides, before Derek heaved a sigh and his hands fell away. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, that means you have to get off of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh! Oh, yeah. Yes. Sorry.\u201d Face burning, Stiles scrambled off of Derek and stepped back a few feet to allow the other man to stand. \u201cSorry about falling on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Derek smiled reassuringly at him as he rose with a fluid grace that Stiles would never in his life be able to pull off. \u201cThanks for letting me hang out and watch the game.\u201d His smile tipped a bit towards inviting and he took a shuffling step closer to Stiles. \u201cIt was fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles found himself staring at Derek\u2019s mouth again, and no amount of concerted effort was able to draw his attention away. \u201cThanks for the beer. Sorry I drank more than you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gave a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a drinker. Doesn\u2019t really do much to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwful expensive brew you bought, for someone who doesn\u2019t drink,\u201d Stiles noted with an arch of his brows.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was more for you than me,\u201d Derek said with another shrug. \u201cBut I knew that if I was going to drink any, I\u2019d at least want it to taste good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d </p>\n<p>They ran out of words and stood there awkwardly staring at each other, less than an arm\u2019s span apart. Derek finally broke the silence by clearing his throat and scratching the back of his neck while he stared down at Stiles\u2019 feet. \u201cHave you seen the new Superman movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Unsure where <i>that</i> had come from, Stiles blinked and slowly shook his head. \u201cNo, haven\u2019t had the chance. I\u2019m usually more of a Batman guy myself, anyway. Supes is such a fucking Boy Scout.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek suddenly looked like a kicked puppy, and he glanced askance towards the door. \u201cOh. Well, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been wanting to see it, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone who\u2019d be willing to go with me. And, well, you know that it\u2019s not nearly as fun to go to the movies alone, so...\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh <i>shit</i>. \u201cYes! I mean, ahem, yes. Yes, if you\u2019d like to take me to the movies--I mean go to the movies with me--um, I mean, like, the two of us go together. Fuck. Hey, you wanna catch that Superman movie later this week?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Derek finally looked back at him, he was pressing his mouth down in a frown that was an obvious attempt to stop from laughing, his eyes doing that goddamn sparkling thing again. \u201cThat sounds great. When do you get out of class on Wednesday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Stiles blurted, then pressed his lips together and barely resisted slapping himself in the mouth.</p>\n<p>Starting to look unsure of himself again, Derek cringed a little and forced a smile. \u201cI, um, <i>really</i> want to see the movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll say! Well, hm... I get out at five that day, but I will be <i>starving</i> by that point, since I don\u2019t really get a break between that and my earlier class, which means I\u2019ll be running on granola bar fumes from the five minute gap I <i>do</i> have. So, I\u2019ll need to eat first or else we run the risk of me turning zombie on your ass and gnawing your brains right out of your skull in an attempt at obtaining nutrients. So, we could maybe catch a showing at, like, six-thirty or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr we could eat first.\u201d Derek had said the words nearly all at once, and his jaw made a click sound as he forced it closed at the end. Stiles thought it was rather odd that a guy as awesome as Derek was so nervous about making new friends. It was kind of cute, in a totally perplexing way.</p>\n<p>\u201cDinner <i>and</i> a movie. That is so sweet.\u201d Stiles went for teasing, but Derek brightened as if it were real praise, so Stiles just chuckled softly to himself and let it slide. \u201cSo, you wanna meet here or at the food place or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFood place?\u201d Derek snorted, and his wide, sexy grin was back. Mm, Stiles would totally lick that grin if he were allowed. Goddamn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean, smart guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about I pick you up here? That way you only have to worry about driving from school to here in your food-deprived state.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good. Say...five-twenty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d They had slowly started to drift towards the door while they settled the time, and all too soon Derek was standing partway in the hall. He continued to grin at Stiles, and the way he dragged his feet it seemed like he really didn\u2019t want to go. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he said in a half-murmur, leaning in a bit close as his heavy-lidded eyes flicked down to Stiles\u2019 mouth then up to lock gazes with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Stiles whispered, feeling like he must have passed out from all the beer and this was just a very lovely dream. It almost looked like Derek wanted to kiss him, which was ridiculous because Derek was with Erica. Right. Fuck. Derek was with Erica. Stiles leaned away and plastered on a smile. \u201cDrive safely.\u201d </p>\n<p>He was fairly sure that he was just imagining the disappointment on Derek\u2019s face when he shut the door.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Stiles barely glanced up from his essay when he heard Erica come home. \u201cDerek was here earlier,\u201d he called out as his fingers clacked away. \u201cYou missed him by like an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek was here? Again? So soon?\u201d Erica tossed her coat over the back of the armchair and made herself at home beside Stiles on the couch. \u201cSpill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing really to spill. We watched the game.\u201d He did glance up then, and frowned at the moue of confusion on Erica\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you had fun,\u201d she pressed, more of an assertion than a question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. We even made plans to hang out in a couple days. Grab something to eat, catch a movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, that made Erica squeal and jiggle around in her seat, blond curls flying everywhere. \u201cYes! Awesome! I knew it! So you like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Yeah? What\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p>\n<p>She unleashed another disturbingly girlish sound and leapt to her feet. \u201cThis is great! I\u2019m calling him now. Do you mind if I call him now?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stared at her, wondering if all the hours working retail finally <i>had</i> driven her insane like she\u2019d always threatened. \u201cWhy would I mind?\u201d But she was already down the hall and in her room before he\u2019d finished his sentence. </p>\n<p>Shaking his head, he looked back down at his essay. Only, he couldn\u2019t really focus on the words anymore. All he could think about was Erica talking to Derek and being all sweet and lovey and excited that her friend approved. Feeling sick, he pushed his laptop aside and fished out his phone. Nothing worked to cheer him up better than his BFF Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles! The Mets <i>killed</i> it, man, did you see! I bet you did a victory dance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, bud.\u201d He smiled and leaned back into the plush couch cushions, trying hard not to think about his failed victory dance and the way it ended with him on Derek\u2019s lap just inches away from where he was currently sitting. \u201cWhile the Mets victory was indeed sweet, that\u2019s not really what I\u2019m calling about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott, being the super awesome ultra best buddy that he was, instantly detected the hint of pain in Stiles\u2019 voice, and switched gears accordingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember that guy I told you about? That regular customer with the perpetual stubble and leather jacket, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Derek? Dat Ass Derek? He\u2019s Giving Me A Derektion? <i>That</i> Derek? Never heard of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snickered and felt a true grin split his face. His Scott was the best Scott, and all other Scotts could just go the fuck home, because his Scott <i>wins</i>. \u201cYou massive dork. Yes. <i>That</i> Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about hi--wait, he didn\u2019t turn you down or something, did he? Oh shit, did you actually work up the nerve to ask him out, and then he, like, said something totally dick? Do you need me to kick some ass for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa there, asthma boy. I don\u2019t think you need to go around kicking anyone\u2019s ass. And, no, that didn\u2019t happen. Believe it or not, something <i>worse</i> has happened.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat could possibly be worse than rejection, dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Stiles stared up at the ceiling and bemoaned his life. \u201cHe\u2019s dating Erica. Not only that, but I think he\u2019s trying to be my friend to make Erica happy or some bullshit. We hung out and watched the game together today, and he wants to see <i>Man of Steel</i> with me in a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott made an affronted sound. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking jealous right now. Those are things <i>I</i> should be doing with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, focus. Besides, you can\u2019t, considering you decided to go to vet school halfway across the fucking country.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo doubt. It sure as hell better be, since it\u2019s stolen my best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s not some dude stealing me. You tell Derek I don\u2019t care <i>how</i> fine his ass is, that he can\u2019t have my status as best bro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one can steal your spot, Scott. Now, seriously, can we swing the focus back around to me and my distress? How am I supposed to just calmly play the role of good pal while Erica gets to have what I <i>really</i> want with Derek?\u201d Stiles sat up and twisted around to make sure Erica\u2019s door was still closed, then dropped his voice to a cautious whisper. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I nearly kissed him tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou slut,\u201d joked Scott with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, man, I\u2019m serious. I fell on his lap and we were totally looking at each other\u2019s lips, and he totally licked his lips and I seriously thought for a moment we were going to kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a low, disapproving sound from Scott\u2019s end. \u201cSounds like a douche if he\u2019s potentially cheating on his girlfriend with her roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, they might not really be in a really real relationship yet? I thought it might have been a one night stand sort of deal, but then he kept wanting to hang out with me, and Erica is flipping her shit in excitement over my approval. So, like, I don\u2019t fucking know.\u201d He scratched at his hair and continued to keep an eye on Erica\u2019s room. \u201cI might also have just been doing a great deal of wishful thinking in that moment. I mean, if he\u2019s with Erica, why would he <i>want</i> me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d said Scott, his voice chiding. \u201cDon\u2019t start with that shit again. You are a total catch. All the babes should want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould, but don\u2019t, Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you have a knack for being totally oblivious about people wanting you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles let out a skeptical hum. \u201cYou are a kind man, Scott McCall. Kinder than an asshole like me deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a--okay, well maybe sometimes--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my shitty guy troubles anymore. Let\u2019s talk about the game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking epic, man!\u201d</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Derek showed up at the coffee shop on Monday at the exact same time he always did, but something about him seemed...different. \u201cIs it just me,\u201d Heather whispered while pretending to wipe down the counter next to Stiles, \u201cor are his pants tighter than normal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Oh, but the Gods were cruel motherfuckers. </p>\n<p>As soon as it was his turn in the queue, Derek smiled wide and strolled up to practically lean across the counter on his elbows. \u201cHey, Stiles,\u201d he greeted, one side of his smile tilting up a bit more in such a charmingly roguish way. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d Stiles chirped back, grinning his patented customer service grin. </p>\n<p>Derek nodded and leaned a bit closer, dropping his voice to a more intimate level. \u201cAnd since I can\u2019t get some more of your delicious cooking, I\u2019ll just have a slice of pumpkin bread on the side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallowed as he felt his cheeks bloom red. \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t try to pass it off as your fruit for the day,\u201d he teased, trying to laugh off his sudden onset of nerves. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a good boy,\u201d Derek promised as he slid his card across the counter for Stiles to ring him up. </p>\n<p>Letting out another awkward laugh, Stiles returned the card and handed over the pastry. \u201cGood. Great. Your health is very important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just grinned at him and moved away towards the pick-up area to await his drink. Once he finally left, Heather sidled up next to Stiles and whispered harshly, \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me, Stilinski?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was totally eye-fucking you the entire time he was here. And that lean! And that smile! Those were flirtatious leanings and smilings!\u201d Her eyes were wide, and she looked torn between cheering and chastising. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a friend!\u201d Stiles objected. \u201cAnd, like, barely that! He\u2019s dating my roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heather gave him very skeptical eyebrows. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 case was not helped by Derek\u2019s repeat performances on Tuesday and Wednesday. Wednesday was worse, actually. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to tonight,\u201d murmured Derek, leaning so far over the counter he could practically purr it in Stiles\u2019 ear if he wanted. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agreed absently as he punched in Derek\u2019s order and tired to look only partially invested in the conversation. \u201cSupposed to be a decent movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking we could go to Arborio\u2019s for dinner tonight. What do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nearly punched in a $300 order, cursed, and quickly backed out to correct the mistake. Crisis averted, he looked up to gape at Derek. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite place.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled back, meeting Stiles\u2019 eyes with a pleased confidence. \u201cI know. Erica told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles handed Derek his card and order numbly, unsure how to feel about that.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Hungry and anxious, Stiles stood in front of the mirror on his door and scrutinized his wardrobe choice. He was half tempted to ask Erica for advice, since she was home for the evening, but he felt a bit odd asking her to help him pick something out that would impress her boyfriend. Chewing his lip, he turned one way and then back the other. He was wearing a dark gold button-up that he\u2019d been told really brought out the gold undertones of his eyes, but he just wasn\u2019t sure it was good enough. Then again, who was he fucking kidding? Like anything he wore would be good enough for Dat Ass Derek. <i>Fuck</i>.</p>\n<p>There was a knock at the apartment door, and despite Stiles\u2019 desperate \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Erica beat him to it. She swung open the door with a wide smirk, and cocked her hip against the frame as she shamelessly oggled Derek in his positively edible ensemble of earthy green button-up (talk about bringing out the brilliance of one\u2019s eyes, holy <i>shit</i>) and sinfully tailored slacks. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, now I\u2019m almost jealous,\u201d she purred. </p>\n<p>Stiles belted out a loud, stiff, obviously fake laugh and shouldered past her to join Derek out in the hall. \u201cWhat? Jealous? Don\u2019t be silly! Psh! What? No! Bye!\u201d He closed the door as quickly as possible, and tugged Derek away from the apartment as Erica\u2019s laughter followed their retreat. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d Derek said later, over dinner (which was fucking <i>divine</i>). \u201cI never noticed how gold your eyes were, before. They look a bit like--\u201d He seemed to suddenly realize something, and cut himself off with a generous sip of wine. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t stop there. Like what? Two pools of molten gold? Like the sunset over a secluded bay? Like the morning rays of dawn slipping in through the curtains? Please, by all means, finish the lovely cliche. My heart\u2019s all aflutter.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek choked on his wine, but laughed his way through it. \u201cSomething like all those things, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Stiles hummed, resting his chin on his hands and staring across the romantic table spread at Derek. \u201cAnd your eyes are like the shores of tropical islands. A central ring of brown, bleeding out into greens and Caribbean blues.\u201d When Derek stopped laughing and stared at him with a suddenly very serious (and hopeful?) expression, Stiles realized that his teasing sounded a tad too sincere, and he quickly looked away and gulped down his own wine. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe movie starts soon,\u201d he eventually said to clear the air of all the intensity. Derek made a mild sound of agreement and waved down their server to bring the check. When Derek insisted he pay for the entire meal, Stiles only relented if he\u2019d be allowed to get their movie tickets.</p>\n<p>They were both a bit over-dressed for the film, but they didn\u2019t care. It was a perfect distraction for Stiles--all action and adventure and motherfucking <i>super heroes</i>. But, he\u2019d keep making the mistake of looking over at Derek to share in a moment, and find the man smiling at him with such obvious affection.</p>\n<p>When Derek took his hand halfway through and rubbed his thumb along Stiles\u2019 knuckles, he <i>knew</i>. It hadn\u2019t all been wishful thinking, hadn\u2019t all been in his mind. He didn\u2019t know what to think, how to feel. On the one hand, he was beyond thrilled that the man of his dreams was evidently just as into him. On the other hand, he couldn\u2019t do that to Erica. </p>\n<p>He allowed the hand-holding throughout the rest of the movie, but then jerked his hand away once it was finally time to leave. Derek walked far too close to him as they made it out to the car, and more than once Stiles found himself dodging the man\u2019s reaching hand\u2019s, trying hard to make it look unintentional. Once they were seated in Derek\u2019s Camaro, Stiles felt like jumping back out and making a run for it. This was fucking torture. The man he wanted was <i>right there</i> and wanted him, too, but he couldn\u2019t have him! He couldn\u2019t! He was an asshole, yeah, but he refused to be a complete dick. Erica deserved better.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Derek asked, making no move to start the car. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles said with a shrug and a smile. \u201cJust thinking about the movie, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowned and looked like he was going to say more, but then he just gave a little nod and slid the key into the ignition. The ride back to the apartment was awkward and filled with glances from Derek and forced smiles from Stiles. It was fucking hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me walk you to your door,\u201d Derek offered once they finally arrived, and Stiles fought hard not to give him an incredulous look. Because, really? <i>Really</i>? He couldn\u2019t tell that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t exactly welcoming?</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Naw, I\u2019m good. Thanks.\u201d Stiles was out of the car and in the apartment building before Derek would have time to object.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Erica was out when he got home, and he made sure to be locked away in his room pretending to sleep when she finally got back late that evening. He did his best to avoid her for the next few days, especially since she would always have this strange look on her face that was a cross between confusion and anger whenever she saw him. Whenever she\u2019d open her mouth to say something, Stiles would make some lame excuse and rush out of the apartment.</p>\n<p>As much as it sucked to feel uncomfortable in his own home, it was worse when he went to work. On Thursday morning, he saw Derek pause on the sidewalk outside the shop\u2019s door, before cringing and continuing on his way. Derek didn\u2019t even pass by the place on Friday morning. Heather kept darting Stiles concerned looks throughout their shifts, and it had never been more difficult to maintain his professional smile and good customer service.</p>\n<p>He kept telling himself that it was no big deal. Why would he want to date someone who could cheat on his partner anyway? And if this put a strain on Erica and Derek\u2019s relationship, good, because she deserved better than to be treated like that.</p>\n<p>Still. He missed Derek. He missed Derek like <i>whoa</i>.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Saturday morning felt a bit like deja vu, except one of the key players was replaced by a different actor. Boyd gave him a little nod as they passed in the hall, Stiles on his way to the bathroom, Boyd on his way from the bathroom and into Erica\u2019s room. For a solid ten minutes, Stiles just stood there in the middle of the hall and tried to figure out what the <i>fuck</i> was going on.</p>\n<p>When Erica and Boyd both came out later in search for food, Stiles was waiting for them at the kitchen table, cup of coffee having long gone cold in his hands. Erica glared at him a bit as she moved to gather breakfast things, but Boyd just took a seat across from Stiles with a lazy casualness. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was starting to think you\u2019d died and become a ghost,\u201d snarked Erica, which wasn\u2019t her best work, but she hadn\u2019t had her coffee yet, so could be excused. </p>\n<p>Stiles tapped the rim of his mug with his fingers and glared down at the dark brew. He breathed deep and loud through his nose and tried to calm himself. Boyd glanced at him with an arched brow, then went right back to admiring the way Erica looked in shorts and a clingy tank top. Finally, Stiles could take no more, and he erupted with: \u201cSo does this mean you and Derek broke up?\u201d</p>\n<p>That got Boyd and Erica\u2019s full attentions, and they stared at him with eyebrows raised so high they were like mini toupees for their foreheads. Finally Boyd started laughing contained, silent laughs that had his shoulders jerking and his torso curling in on itself. Erica just gaped for a moment more before pieces seemed to click into place in her mind and she reexamined Stiles as if seeing him under a completely different lense. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe were never dating,\u201d she said slowly, haltingly, as if speaking to some scared, stupid beast that could either bolt or lash out at any moment. \u201cIf anything, <i>you</i> two were.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 jaw dropped, and his hands flailed a bit as he exclaimed, \u201cWhat? No! What! What about Saturday night!\u201d</p>\n<p>She just gave him a confused look, cocking her head to the side. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe stayed the night! I assumed...\u201d</p>\n<p>Realization dawned in her eyes, and she bit her lip with an evil little snicker. \u201cOh. Oh, yeah, no that was totally not what you thought it was. He was sexiled from his own place, because his roommate had found some hot young thang at the party. I may have offered the use of my air mattress out of the goodness of my own heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason this made Boyd\u2019s laughter move from silent to a strange melody of snorts and coughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d Erica continued, dragging the word out in a sing-song manner, \u201cI may have offered because he\u2019d spent the better part of that party bitching morosely about how the cute guy at the coffee shop was already taken. And, no, Isaac, he <i>doesn\u2019t</i> want to dance with that guy over there, because that guy isn\u2019t Cute Coffee Shop Guy. And did you know that Cute Coffee Shop Guy just has the best voice and smile and adorable, upturned nose?\u201d </p>\n<p>She grinned down at Stiles, and he could almost swear she had the sharp teeth of a beast. \u201cWhy, no, Derek,\u201d she continued, obviously pretending to be herself and making a mockery of the exchange, \u201c<i>do</i> tell me more. Does Cute Coffee Shop Guy have a <i>name</i>? Oh, really? That\u2019s quite an interesting name. I wonder what kind of parent would name their child Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>For a fleeting moment, Stiles was filled with elation and hope, but then it all came crashing down as he remembered the way he\u2019d treated Derek at the end of their date (fuck it had totally been a date! <i>Shit</i>!). He thought about the way Derek had paused outside the shop before pressing on, and how he hadn\u2019t come in for his usual since that disastrous night. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, god,\u201d he groaned, burying his face in his hands and doubling over in his seat. \u201cOh fuck. Erica, I\u2019ve made a horrible mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Boyd seemed to finally have a handle on his laughter, because when he spoke, his voice was only a little bumpy with suppressed chuckling, \u201csince you thought he and Erica were together, he tried something and you shot him down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nodded his head while still keeping his face firmly hidden in his palms. \u201cHe held my hand and tried to walk me to the door, and I was such a standoffish <i>dick</i>. Now he won\u2019t even buy coffee from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Erica\u2019s teasing instantly stopped. She tutted and moved to stroke her fingers through his hair. \u201cHe\u2019d said you were suddenly really cold, and he wasn\u2019t sure why. It\u2019s sweet that you\u2019d be such a good friend to me in the face of temptation, but sweetie...you gotta fix this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nodding again, Stiles slowly lifted his head. \u201cI\u2019ll call him or text him or--fuck!\u201d He nearly banged his forehead against the table in frustration, but Erica\u2019s grip on his hair stopped him. \u201cI don\u2019t even have his fucking phone number!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Giving his hair a playful tug that bordered on painful, Erica strode out of the kitchen to fetch her phone.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Hey! So. Um. I\u2019m evidently a complete moron. Also, hi, this is Stiles.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Hi. Can\u2019t talk now.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Is that a REAL \u2018can\u2019t talk now,\u2019 or are you just blowing me off? I mean, I can understand if you\u2019re just blowing me off. I must have come across as such a fucking asshole. I\u2019m really, really, infinitely sorry! I thought you were dating Erica.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>What</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Yeah. Um. That morning when you came out all fresh from the shower and naked and stuff, I totally thought you and Erica had hooked up the night before. To be fair, you did not correct me the couple times I mentioned it.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>You mentioned it? And I was wearing a towel.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>You were indeed, quite unfortunately. As great a sight as that was, I wouldn\u2019t have minded if you\u2019d forgotten the towel. And yeah, I totally mentioned it like at least twice. Once about how I was making Morning After breakfast without getting the benefits, and later about how guys who just scored the night before shouldn\u2019t comment on those with lacking sex lives.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Ah. First time, I thought you were flirting. Second time, I honestly did not catch that part because I was distracted by the part about you being single.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Oh reeeeaaaaaally?</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>I don\u2019t think we need to establish that I was interested. That\u2019s kind of a known factor now, I\u2019m assuming.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Was? Past tense?</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>That depends.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>On?</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>You only acted like that because you thought I was seeing your friend?</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>OMG YES. If I knew you were even the slightest bit into me, I\u2019d have behaved quite a bit differently. For one thing, that moment with me on your lap on the couch would have gone in a far more enjoyable direction than your departure.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Oh?</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Oh, yes. Would you like me to detail it out for you? Because I promise you that I\u2019ve quite the vivid scene mapped out. </p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>I\u2019d rather you enact it.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Oh, I could get behind that.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>That, too.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Fuck. Um. Ok, so, if I haven\u2019t screwed my chances entirely, would you be willing to go out with me tonight?</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Tonight? That\u2019s rather short notice. And kind of sudden.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Dude, you showed up at my door with beer, unannounced, only hours after having spent the morning with me. </p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>What time would you like to get together tonight? And for what? Where?</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>8? Another movie? But, at my place instead of a theater? My couch misses you.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Only your couch? Want me to bring anything?</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Not just my couch. ;) Bring yourself. Clothes optional, even.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>Someone\u2019s optimistic.</i>\n</p>\n<p>To: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>Just let it be known that I\u2019m willing to do whatever you want for me to make it up to you. What. Ever. You. Want.</p>\n<p>From: Dat Ass Derek</p>\n<p>\n<i>See you at 8</i>\n</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>\u201cThis movie is ridiculous,\u201d laughed Derek, and Stiles felt some weight lift off his chest, because despite assurances he\u2019d still worried that Derek was pissed at him. Seeing him laugh and smile and thoroughly enjoying himself as he was sprawled out on the couch made Stiles feel a little better. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Stiles said with a grin as he reached for his beer on the end table. \u201cMST3k finds the worst films and rips on them. It\u2019s fucking gold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek was still snickering, his eyes fucking <i>sparkling</i> again as he shook his head. \u201cBut this is so stupid! Just how many days in a row is it going to be the full moon? Do they not understand what waxing and waning is? And their concept of werewolves is <i>way</i> off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Stiles bumped his shoulder against Derek\u2019s and laughed. \u201cAnd what are you, an expert on werewolves all of a sudden?\u201d</p>\n<p>Smirking, Derek looked askance at Stiles. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you do for a living? Research werewolves?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek seemed highly amused by that, and Stiles <i>really</i> liked his smile. Like, seriously, it was ridiculous how much he wanted to snap a photo of it and frame it in fucking gold and hang it above his goddamn mantlepiece. \u201cNothing so fascinating, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m just a video game designer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stopped smiling, and he quickly reached out to snatch up the remote and turn the TV off. Before Derek could ask him why, he was on his knees and moving to straddle Derek, much like he had after the Mets game. \u201cOh, my god,\u201d Stiles whispered, his lips nearly brushing Derek\u2019s. \u201cYou have no idea how sexy I find you right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinked up at him for a second before positively beaming. \u201cOh yeah? Want me to tell you about my latest project?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tilting his head back, Stiles closed his eyes and moaned as he rocked his hips forward. \u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He heard Derek curse and felt strong hands quickly move to grip his hips. \u201c<i>Christ</i>. Um. Oh, my god, Stiles. What was I talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVideo games,\u201d gasped Stiles, rolling his hips again and delighting in the feel of Derek growing harder and harder against him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yeah. Open world RPG.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike Skyrim?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFallout, actually. Working in conjunction with Bethesda on the next one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles bit his lip as his rolling stuttered. \u201cFuck, Derek, keep talking like that and I\u2019m going to come too soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek let out something that sounded suspiciously like a whimper, and he lifted his hips up to meet Stiles\u2019 own. \u201cI can show you some of the designs.\u201d Their dicks pressed together through too many layers of fabric, and Derek groaned. \u201cConcept artwork. For characters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my god, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSettings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fingers shaking, Stiles reached between them to try to get at his and Derek\u2019s flies. \u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working on the team developing some of the new mechanics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think it was <i>possible</i> for you to be even sexier. Shit!\u201d Stiles managed to get them both free of their jeans and underwear (boxers for Stiles, briefs for Derek--not that Stiles was surprised, considering the tightness of Derek\u2019s pants). He wrapped his long fingers around the both of them and choked back a cry at the combination of the feel and sight of them rubbing together. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d confessed Derek, eyes glued to their laps, mesmerized by the movement of Stiles\u2019 hand. \u201cDo you realize we haven\u2019t even kissed yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t?\u201d Stiles looked up from watching himself jack them both, to stare in stunned wonder at Derek\u2019s gorgeous face. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiscommunication,\u201d gasped Derek, raising his own eyes and locking their gaze with Stiles\u2019. \u201cGoddamn, you are so fucking hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Me?</i>\u201d balked Stiles. As much as one <i>can</i> balk while jacking two dicks and rocking wantonly on his boyfriend\u2019s (did this make Derek his boyfriend?) lap. \u201cTake a look in the mirror. For fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d said Derek with a smile that looked absolutely perfect set against his arousal-red cheeks. \u201cJust...just kiss me, already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grinned back and leaned forward to comply.</p>"
