  "text": "<p>Geralt stays up on the mountain for a long time, long after the sound of Jaskier\u2019s retreating footsteps fades into the distance. Once the fist of anger and sorrow unclenches from around his chest, he\u2019s only left with numbness. Shame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he hears someone approaching, twigs snapping underfoot, hope surges through him. He turns, only to find Borch standing before him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Geralt spits out. \u201cGoing to tell me that Yennefer despises me? That Jaskier is never going to speak to me again either?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to give you a chance to try again,\u201d Borch says with a sympathetic smile. \u201cDon\u2019t waste the opportunity, Geralt of Rivia. I told you if you came with me, I\u2019d show you what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt clenches his teeth. \u201cWhat the hell does that--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Darkness. Geralt\u2019s eyes open to a familiar room. He jerks up and looks around, takes in the bed, the small table to the side, the room divider between the living space and the bath. It\u2019s the room Borch had paid for before the night of the hunt but why is he--</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m going to give you the chance to try again.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> That fucking bastard, </em> Geralt thinks with rising panic. Curses like these are rare and stupid and a waste of everyone\u2019s fucking time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s wrong. Maybe it\u2019s another kind of curse entirely. If this really is a time loop, he should be able to recall what happens next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if answering the unspoken question, a knock sounds on the door followed by Jaskier\u2019s voice. \u201cRise and shine, Geralt. What a beautiful day to slay a dragon.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt dresses quickly and pushes past Jaskier to hunt down Borch. When he finds him outside the inn, Geralt stalks over to him and hisses, \u201cYou\u2019re the golden dragon, I already know. And you cursed me with a fucking <em> time loop </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Borch replies calmly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll remember that fact each time you start over, but it is all I\u2019ll be able to recall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I break the spell?\u201d Geralt grits out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I cannot say. But the spell would not have worked on you if there wasn\u2019t an opportunity to fix a grave misstep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t say or won\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to snap at Borch when he realizes that this might not be all bad. At least he has the chance to relive this day without fucking things up so badly with Yennefer and Jaskier. It\u2019s the obvious solution, so he clamps his mouth shut and figures he can have this whole thing done and dusted within a few tries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time the bugle sounds as they make their way up the mountain, the sun bright overhead, he feels like a tired horse starting its race again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first three loops, Geralt sticks to the very basics. Despite the ache in his gut, he keeps things civil but distant with Yennefer, gives Jaskier strict instructions -- \u201cDon\u2019t bait Yennefer, for fuck\u2019s sake leave the Zerrikanians alone, don\u2019t wander off the path no matter how hungry you get, just stay out of trouble\u201d -- and avoids any conversations about leaving for the coast, about children, djinns, or shoveling horseshit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first days feel like a fever dream. No one around him remembers anything. Yennefer and Jaskier are none the wiser. What happened between them all only exists in the memory of Geralt and Borch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt hates the idea of manipulating interactions to his favor, acting like each day is just a play he has to memorize the lines to. Truth be told, he doesn\u2019t even know what he <em> wants </em>from Yennefer. Though part of him longs to have her look at him with a tender gaze again, anger and frustration and guilt rise inside of him too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Jaskier, it\u2019s simpler. Geralt knows he never wants to see that broken expression on Jaskier\u2019s face ever again.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently his plan to simply <em> not fuck things up </em> isn\u2019t good enough to break the spell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the fourth loop onwards, Geralt attempts to rescue Sir Eyck from his shitty death. Despite Geralt\u2019s best efforts, the idiot manages to die in ways that all involve him falling off a cliff thanks to his own ineptitude. When saving Sir Eyck doesn\u2019t break the curse, Geralt helps Yarpen Zigrin identify which reaver stole his pack, thinking perhaps this fickle magic will finally be satisfied. Instead, a bloody battle breaks out between the reavers and the dwarves, and Geralt gives up on that endeavor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to follow the same basic outline of the original days, to keep things simple and dull. The trickiest moments to navigate are ones that involve Yennefer. Namely convincing her that a dragon\u2019s heart is not a cure for infertility and persuading her to protect the dragon\u2019s egg alongside Borch and himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time they both manage to survive the battle, they part on terms that are slightly uneasy but a far cry from her original outraged departure. Then Jaskier bitches the whole way down the mountain about how Geralt didn\u2019t wake him up for the battle. An irritating relief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt is happy enough with how things turn out during these loops. If it\u2019s good enough for him he can\u2019t understand why the fuck it\u2019s still not good enough to break the spell.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the ninth loop, Geralt tries to ride and ride and ride through until morning, mostly out of curiosity rather than any real belief it will end the spell. He can smell the metallic, blood-like tang of magic encroaching the air around him the closer he gets to midnight, the blacker the sky grows overhead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whether or not he goes to sleep of his own volition, each time he awakes in his bed at the inn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries confronting Borch. \u201cI made things right. Why is the curse not broken?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made things right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d certainly made them not terrible. \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you need to do better than that,\u201d Borch suggests. Geralt wants to punch him. On the twelfth try, he actually does punch him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the twentieth time Geralt has gone through the loop, he decides to just throw himself off the cliff\u2019s edge after Borch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up to his twenty-first attempt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt,\u201d Jaskier says, coming to sit beside him by the fire pit on the first night of the journey. It\u2019s deep into the night, the rest of the party has long departed for bed. Jaskier should be sleeping too.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic, but you seem rather...you seem even more taciturn and surly than usual. Talk to me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the way he says, \u201c<em> Talk to me</em>,\u201d that makes something break in Geralt. This is not the first time Jaskier has uttered those words to him in that soft, concerned voice. Every time it strips away Geralt\u2019s defenses, slips through a crack in the wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck in a time loop,\u201d Geralt grits out. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t figure out how to break the curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought those were just myths. Like a sex curse that required me to make love to a fair maiden from dusk until dawn to save her life.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re real, but they\u2019re very rare and very fucking difficult to deal with,\u201d Geralt says wearily. Vesemir had essentially advised them not to touch the damn things. Witchers were professional monster hunters, not advisors of the heart. There was nothing for the cursed to do but replay the day again and again to find the correct sequence of events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier furrows his brow, the golden firelight dancing across his face. \u201cWhen does each loop start?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt starts the morning of the hunt and ends after the third day, once we\u2019ve made it to the mountain top. Or if I die it starts over too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cYou can <em> die </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. I just start over again. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s dark, Geralt. Even for you.\u201d Jaskier frowns. \u201cSo am I stuck in your time loop? Is the whole world stuck in it? How many times have you done this?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-two times. You won\u2019t remember anything tomorrow. I suppose the whole world must be stuck in it as well. Part of why spells like these are so rare.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBit selfish.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in this alone?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day, then, you\u2019ll tell me, and I\u2019ll believe you, and I\u2019ll help you figure out what you need to do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have many better options. Maybe it\u2019s because the prospect of being in this loop alone for the foreseeable future is more daunting than he\u2019d like to admit. Maybe it\u2019s the calm assurance of Jaskier\u2019s voice that makes Geralt agree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let\u2019s come up with a plan,\u201d Jaskier says, a grin splitting across his face. The undeserved dedication makes his gut clench. He tries to keep the memory of hurting Jaskier at bay. For the first time in over twenty loops, Geralt feels hopeful again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At Jaskier\u2019s reluctant encouragement--\u201cYou know I think she\u2019s the worst monster you\u2019ve faced.\u201d--Geralt tries to set things right with Yennefer, but no matter how well their conversations go, regardless of whether or not they sleep together, whether they decide to remain friends or devolve into a bitter argument, Geralt awakes at the start of another loop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not specifically tied to Yennefer then,\u201d Jaskier suggests during loop forty-five.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overcome with bone-deep exhaustion, Geralt pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou think?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt, what is it <em> you </em>want to happen with Yennefer?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just said it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but eventually you\u2019ll get the loop right, so you may as well decide how you want things to end up with her when you do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You will lose her </em>, he hears Borch say.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He already has, </em> Yennefer says in reply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The words don\u2019t slice through him the way they did at first, the perfect cut from a sharp blade. Now the blade has gone dull, the cut not penetrating quite as deep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt just doesn\u2019t want to lose her in that way. Borch had accused Geralt of being in love with her, but that wasn\u2019t quite right. He\u2019d been falling, tipping over the edge of a boat caught in a raging storm, and someone had grabbed him by the collar and yanked him back to safety before he could crash into the waves.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s starting to think that he doesn\u2019t fundamentally understand what Yennefer wants or why she wants it. While it would be easy to relive this day over and over and memorize the right things to say--it wouldn\u2019t make him <em> feel </em>or believe the words. He\u2019s already damaged something deeply between them by tying their fates together through the djinn\u2019s magic; he\u2019s not going to use a time loop to act his way into Yennefer\u2019s bed or heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he cares for her. Knows that he\u2019s intertwined their fates. He wants things to be better than they are, than they were before Borch cursed him.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is perpetually exhausting that no matter how well the conversation might go with Yennefer, he\u2019ll have to keep having it again and again. That he\u2019ll have to leave behind the newfound understanding and respect blossoming between them only to face her bitterness once again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the next month, he blows the whole farce of a hunt off and keeps Jaskier back at the inn with him to drink and gamble. He memorizes poker hands and winners in fistfights and spends their winnings on food and ale.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times have you been through this?\u201d Jaskier asks around the time Geralt feels more willing to solve the puzzle of it all again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSixty.\u201d He sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been able to help you figure out what you\u2019re doing wrong?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing we\u2019ve been over the details of what happened on the first day and the days after.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to accuse you of anything, Geralt. But were there any details you might have left out?\u201d Jaskier asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt sighs. There\u2019s a resistance in his chest, a deep skepticism that this could possibly be of any import, that traps the words inside. He takes a long sip of his drink to loosen his tongue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time he tells Jaskier about their conversation on the mountain. How Jaskier had asked him to leave for the coast. It\u2019s irrelevant, Geralt assures himself. There\u2019s no reason he and Jaskier need to discuss or reckon with a throwaway conversation they\u2019d had only in Geralt\u2019s memory. There must be something about the dragon or Borch or Yennefer that Geralt is not getting right in the loops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier is quiet for a while after Geralt finishes giving him the basic outline of the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been stingy on the details,\u201d Jaskier says offhandedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you have them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier drums his fingers against his thigh. \u201cI have been thinking about the coast, I suppose. I just didn\u2019t--well, I hadn\u2019t been exactly planning on having that conversation with you. Strange way for me to hit on you, but to be fair, I\u2019ve done stranger.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a moment for the words to sink in. \u201cTo hit on me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cHow could this possibly come as a shock to you, my dear, clever witcher? Surely you remember that night in Oxenfurt.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt remembers, mostly. \u201cWe were drunk out of our skulls in a brothel.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the same woman. At the same time. Beautiful blonde if you recall, legs so long they practically touched the sky.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>An image of Jaskier moving between her legs flashes before his eyes, the one that still comes to him from time to time when he\u2019s pleasuring himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened between <em> us </em>.\u201d Geralt gestures between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne could argue that we had a bit of a sword fight so to speak.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman had pressed their cocks together while she licked and sucked them both off. Neither of them had pulled away. Jaskier may have touched Geralt\u2019s dick a few times, but surely that had been an accident. Geralt may have come when he looked up to find Jaskier\u2019s blue eyes staring back, teeth sinking into his bottom lip as he came undone, but surely that had been a coincidence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was years ago,\u201d Geralt says, trying to shake the memories as heat curls through his toes and up his spine. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Jaskier shoots back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt stares at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this time loop. I won\u2019t remember anything on the next go around?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Jaskier says before he climbs into Geralt\u2019s lap and kisses him.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sleeps with Jaskier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The times he\u2019s considered doing so over the years, especially after that night in Oxenfurt, Geralt has quickly dismissed the notion for fear of things changing. Once he met Yennefer, he\u2019d had enough turmoil to fill multiple lifetimes. Besides, Jaskier had never given any indication that he even <em> wanted </em>something more to happen between them.</p>\n<p>This all seems a shame now given how damned good Jaskier is in bed. Or more accurately, on bedrolls, on the forest floor, on a particularly long, flat rock on the mountainside.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame fucking me doesn\u2019t break the curse,\u201d Jaskier says wistfully on a few separate occasions. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always thought a sex curse of some sort could be rather fun under the right circumstances.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Geralt says each time, wondering at how absurd one man can be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It may not solve the time loop, but fucking Jaskier is an unexpected, reliable benefit to the otherwise monotonous days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been ploughing each other for thirty loops now,\u201d Geralt says, having learned about twelve loops ago that cutting to the chase is the best method.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s eyes light up as they always do. <em> Artful seduction is overrated, </em> Geralt thinks.</p>\n<p>Geralt has the unfair advantage of having learned how Jaskier likes to be touched and fucked, a fact which is not lost on Jaskier. \u201cOh we <em> have </em> been fucking, haven\u2019t we,\u201d he pants, dazedly, throwing an arm over his face when Geralt reaches one hand up to pinch a nipple as he sucks Jaskier off with messy enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He learns things about Jaskier, too. After so many years of knowing one another, it surprises him that there are still things to discover. He didn\u2019t know it was the Countess de Stael who had sparked Jaskier\u2019s interest in poetry. He didn\u2019t know that she\u2019d gone to visit Jaskier during his most recent year as a guest lecturer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her there,\u201d Geralt says, propping himself up on the bedroll, resting his cheek on his fist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you didn\u2019t visit me enough,\u201d Jaskier replies, mirroring Geralt\u2019s pose, a half-smile playing on his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt had visited him numerous times and they both know it. At the time he\u2019d told Jaskier there were more contracts than usual available in the area, which hadn\u2019t been strictly true. The truth was that Geralt knew all manner of trouble Jaskier got up to when left to his own devices and the thought of traveling for a year without any adventures together had made something twist in his gut.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> If I had one blessing it would be-- </em>\n</p>\n<p>Every time the memory comes to him, he curses himself. Why the fuck had he said that to Jaskier? It doesn\u2019t matter that Jaskier doesn\u2019t remember because Geralt remembers enough for the both of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt rolls onto his back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Geralt says to the stars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another solid month where Geralt gives up on solving the loop and instead makes it his mission to try anything and everything with Jaskier. Every time they tumble into bed Jaskier is even more impressed and shocked and delighted, shouting Geralt\u2019s name louder each time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The best days, Geralt soon learns, are always the third and final day of the loop. When Jaskier gets a certain glint in his eyes and rolls Geralt onto his back, murmuring, \u201cLet me take care of you this time,\u201d before sliding between his legs and pressing his tongue flat against Geralt\u2019s hole. When Jaskier wraps Geralt\u2019s wrists in their spare tunics and ties him to the bedpost, teasing and teasing until he rides Geralt\u2019s cock or fucks him silly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt is impressed at first that Jaskier can learn in only three days how very much Geralt loves to be spoiled in bed. It takes a good while for Geralt to realize Jaskier had him figured out long before this all began.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the one-hundredth loop, Geralt decides he has to get back to the dragon-saving on the next go around, but before that he\u2019s going to fuck Jaskier in as many positions as possible. What a way to commemorate the most exhausting--albeit pleasurable--curse Geralt has ever been involved in.</p>\n<p>They bathe together in Geralt\u2019s room--Gods he\u2019s going to miss the hot bath he\u2019s been taking every day for the past month, the bath salts and oils, gifted by Jaskier, replenishing again and again--and then takes Jaskier to his bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to just have to bathe again,\u201d Jaskier points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else do you think the coin\u2019s for?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt has slept with Jaskier many times now, and still, it feels new. He never tires of that look in Jaskier\u2019s eyes, the one that makes Geralt feel like a sunken treasure suddenly found.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t plan for the sex to be so gentle this time around--since Geralt realized how much Jaskier enjoys being fucked against the wall, that\u2019s been Geralt\u2019s favored move--but suddenly Jaskier is in his lap, and Geralt is rocking into him with great restraint as they kiss, needy and wet, Jaskier\u2019s tongue more demanding than the lazy way he rides Geralt would imply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just so--oh <em> fuck </em>,\u201d Jaskier moans, head dropping to Geralt\u2019s shoulder, his hands squeezing into Geralt\u2019s side. He bites down and then kisses his way up Geralt\u2019s throat, eliciting a shiver of pleasure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever heard you at a loss for words.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy it while it lasts,\u201d Jaskier says, the words broken, breathy puffs against Geralt\u2019s neck. \u201cI just never thought this would happen.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He strokes his hands along Jaskier\u2019s back, fingers tracing up each vertebra of his spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to come inside of you?\u201d Geralt asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGods yes. Please.\u201d He leans back to study Geralt\u2019s face. \u201cOh, you whoreson, you already know how much I want it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve begged for it a few times.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you? Do you ever beg for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt thinks of all the times Jaskier\u2019s gripped his thighs and spread them wide as he fucked Geralt with perfect, relentless thrusts and he begged Jaskier for more. Thinks of all the times he\u2019d been on his hands and knees and begged Jaskier to be rougher with him. He feels himself go harder inside of Jaskier now, his balls aching as he edges closer to his release.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He meets Jaskier\u2019s eyes and says, \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eyes fluttering shut, Jaskier lets out a long, low groan. Geralt rolls them over and hoists Jaskier\u2019s legs over his shoulders so he can find that perfect angle that makes Jaskier cry Geralt\u2019s name out over and over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They bathe together again and when Jaskier makes a half-hearted move towards the door to leave, Geralt stops him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this the best you\u2019ve had?\u201d Jaskier asks, moving back towards the bed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant between the two of us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you competing with <em> yourself </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier rests his hands on his hips and lifts his chin in defiance. \u201cWhy, yes I am. I want to be the best of the Jaskiers of all the loops that you\u2019ve had.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Geralt says charitably. \u201cYes, you\u2019re the least insufferable of all the Jaskiers that have come before you. Now shut up and come to bed.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next evening, Jaskier asks, \u201cWhen do you suppose you might go back to try to break the spell instead of gambling and drinking and fucking your days away? Not that it\u2019s the worst way to spend your days, mind you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStart of the next loop tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier makes a humming sound. \u201cI know you\u2019ve done this countless times before with those <em> other </em>Jaskiers, but if you\u2019ll indulge me once more. Take me through the original day just one more time. Don\u2019t leave any details out, I know you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The details are agonizing, but he tries harder than he has before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt is not expecting an odd, pensive look to appear on Jaskier\u2019s face when Geralt tells him about the conversation they had on that first day. \u201cYou said you\u2019d been thinking about what pleases you. You wanted us to leave for the coast.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing we didn\u2019t leave for the coast,\u201d Jaskier says, and it looks like he\u2019s trying to smile, but it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns at him and searches Geralt\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving something out. What is it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, nothing he did wrong, so Geralt doesn\u2019t know why he hesitates before saying, \u201cI went to find Yennefer after we talked.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks at him for a moment. \u201cOh, right,\u201d he says. \u201cThat does make sense. After all, she's the reason we embarked on the bloody dragon quest in the first place.\u201d He clasps his hands together. \u201cRight then. Let\u2019s get some ale, shall we? We can discuss what strategy you might employ next to end your curse. Some say the booze might dull the mind, but I rather think it\u2019ll sharpen my wits.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drinking sounds like a good idea, so Geralt follows Jaskier out of their room and down to the busy tavern below without protest. It\u2019s rowdy tonight, and Geralt recognizes all the arms and shoulders bumping against his, in the absent way you might recognize a road you\u2019d driven through countless times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier had asked Geralt why he didn\u2019t bother getting to know anyone. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do,\u201d he\u2019d said. \"Keep things more interesting.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt had sighed and taken a long sip of his ale. \u201cHow would that keep things more interesting?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of all the bizarre things you could say to people! The things you could learn! This time loop curse is wasted on you.\u201d Jaskier had shaken his head, amused and chastising all at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tonight, though, Jaskier is muted. He doesn\u2019t flirt with Geralt or the barmaid, doesn\u2019t try to egg Geralt on to do something outrageous. After a few subdued drinks, he disappears. At first, Geralt assumes he\u2019s just gone for a piss, but after awhile pinpricks of worry creep down his spine, and he goes in search of Jaskier. He can still catch a whiff of Jaskier\u2019s lavender oil in the air, and Geralt follows the trail.</p>\n<p>The path from the tavern snakes past the forge and herbalists' shops, past clusters of houses and farmland. Finally, Geralt finds Jaskier sitting on a small hill at the edge of town, looking up at the sky. What troubles Geralt most is that Jaskier\u2019s lute is by his side instead of in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Geralt can speak, Jaskier turns to look at him, and there\u2019s something sharp in his eyes that silences Geralt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the darkness, Geralt has no trouble seeing the steely set to Jaskier\u2019s jaw, the lift of his chin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I ought to tell you that I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d Jaskier says, and though Geralt has been trained to speed up and slow down the beating of his heart, he finds it racing away from him beyond control. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me if part of you, even most of you, still loves Yennefer, but I need you to know that my hat\u2019s in the ring for your heart. I\u2019d never forgive myself if I didn\u2019t tell you that my sun rises and sets with you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t know how to respond. His heart continues to race, but otherwise, his body is perfectly still. He takes in a deep breath of the cool night air. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says finally, \u201ccome back to the inn.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back without me.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s voice is gentle but firm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be there later.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late when Jaskier finally returns. \u201cI won\u2019t remember this tomorrow,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYou can just pretend you don\u2019t either.\u201d He gathers his things and takes them to the second room he\u2019s rented for the night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s words never leave Geralt\u2019s ears. He reels each time they ring in his head. For the next ten loops, he stops sleeping with Jaskier. It feels like the first time they made their way across the dangerous mountain terrain, the way it felt when he watched Borch plummet to the unseen earth below. Geralt edges around Jaskier, unsure of what to say or do with this information that Jaskier has no idea he\u2019d even shared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s torture, the way things shift back to how they were before. Not being able to touch Jaskier when he knows he could, when all he has to do is ask, is unbearable. No matter what Geralt chooses to do, watching Jaskier chasing after T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a or sleeping with the pretty barmaid at the tavern in town fills Geralt with frustrated longing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He misses the tender looks that Jaskier gave him, the ones that belonged to Geralt alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt breaks on loop one hundred and ten.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and I--\u201d he says, gripping Jaskier\u2019s arm. \u201cSomething started between us during this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And when Jaskier\u2019s eyes go wide and bright and joyful, Geralt kisses him fiercely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And even later when Jaskier asks again if this is the best it\u2019s been for them, Geralt says yes, because it\u2019s the truth every time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On loop one-hundred and eleven, Yennefer catches them in the forest outside of camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt may have had many, many talks with her over the course of this curse, but of course, she remembers none of them. He balks at the idea of having this particular conversation. Leaving it alone is tempting, but Jaskier insists that every decision counts, that Geralt should at least try to do the right thing in case today is the day the curse breaks. It\u2019s unlikely, but he agrees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds Yennefer in her tent, furiously mixing something in a glass canister.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to curse me, I have bad news for you. Someone else has gotten there first.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looks up sharply, and after all manner of name-calling, she relaxes enough to hear him out. Yennefer responds best to his summaries of previous loops which emphasize how truly magnificent she is while putting any blame regarding romantic failure on his own ineptitude. He also makes a point to tell her how important she is to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking the bard,\u201d she says. \u201cHow many loops did that take?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSixty.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d She snorts. \u201cI knew from the moment I met you that there was something between you two,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cAnd he was always glaring at me when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt puts a hand on her arm. \u201cI did try with us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was always the problem, wasn\u2019t it, Geralt? We\u2019ve both been trying. Perhaps too hard.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt thinks of the easy warmth with Jaskier, the way the warmth builds into bursts of flame that threaten to engulf him completely, and then recede back. With Yennefer it is always icy cold to burning hot, there is no in-between.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tempted to leave the conversation here, but there\u2019s a rightness to it. And if this is part of what it takes to break the curse, he might as well get the whole thing right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else I should tell you,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout the djinn and my wish.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted you,\u201d Geralt admits to Jaskier. \u201cWhen we first met.\u201d They\u2019re lying in bed together, well-fed, tipsy, and fucked-out. Moments like these, Geralt wouldn\u2019t mind reliving over and over. He only wishes Jaskier would remember each time the way he does. It\u2019s getting harder to live in those moments before he knows the things that Geralt knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you couldn\u2019t stand me,\u201d Jaskier replies, a teasing lilt in his voice.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt smiles up at the ceiling. \u201cStill can\u2019t. Still want you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that to me,\u201d Jaskier says, but he doesn\u2019t sound like he means it. \u201cYou wanted me,\u201d he repeats, surprise lacing his words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were so young when we met and then you were only ever chasing women, so I thought it best to leave it alone.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a long sigh. \u201cGeralt, never let me tell you that you\u2019re the only idiot of the two of us.\u201d He slides out of bed--still naked, and Geralt takes advantage of the moment to admire Jaskier\u2019s ass--and retrieves his lute. Jaskier lets out a long breath of air. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on that I want to play for you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt isn\u2019t sure what to expect. In each loop, Jaskier jokes about the music he\u2019ll make about Geralt\u2019s mouth, his arms, his chest, his cock. He braces himself for something along those lines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, the song Jaskier plays is quiet, serious. Aching and longing. It splits Geralt open and leaves him raw.\u00a0 Before the dragon hunt, Jaskier had mentioned working on a new ballad, but Geralt had only heard tiny bits and pieces of it. Quiet and serious. He realizes this is probably the same one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before, he never would have thought too much about the lyrics to Jaskier\u2019s song, but now\u2026 \u201cIs that about--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t know what to say. The melodic sound of Jaskier\u2019s voice still ringing in his head, the words still cutting into him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> But the story is this / She\u2019ll destroy with her sweet kiss.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s the story or at least part of it. Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said some awful things to you. Before the curse,\u201d Geralt confesses after he\u2019s fucked Jaskier against a tree in a semi-private part of the woods near town (he may have enjoyed fucking Jaskier in nature more than expected, and he might have enjoyed the risk of being caught even more).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>His forehead is pressed against Jaskier\u2019s neck; he\u2019s breathing in the sharp, hot smell of his arousal and their shared pleasure. His hands are still around Jaskier\u2019s waist. Fuck if he knows why he\u2019s finally blurted those words out now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier stills beneath his hands. \u201cHow many loops has this been?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOver a hundred.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd is this the first time you\u2019re telling me about these awful things?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier turns around to look at Geralt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCommunication, Geralt. The lesson here is clearly communication!\u201d Jaskier\u2019s eyes widen in exasperation. \u201cYour emotional constipation manages to reach new heights after <em> decades </em>of knowing one another. And please don\u2019t explain to me again how the passage of time feels different for witchers and sorcerers than us mere mortals.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt makes himself repeat the fight with Yen, Borch\u2019s words, Geralt\u2019s anger and what he\u2019d said to Jaskier. <em> If life could give me one blessing.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>They\u2019re still standing together against the tree, half-dressed and half-touching. The words fall between them, a low thrum of shame blossoming in Geralt\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you still feel that way?\u201d Jaskier asks, his voice is steady, but Geralt can smell a faint trace of fear.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt closes his eyes briefly. His hands, still on Jaskier\u2019s hips, tighten their grasp. \u201cNot at all. Never really did.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all say things we don\u2019t mean sometimes. In the heat of the moment. You needn\u2019t let it torture you so, Geralt.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was torturing me,\u201d he mutters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou felt the need to blurt it out after we\u2019d just had very <em> very </em>nice forest sex and ruin the moment.\u201d Geralt can\u2019t argue with that. \u201cAnyway, if you think that\u2019s the source of the loop, you can let it go. I don\u2019t even remember you saying that and if I did I\u2019d forgive you. There isn\u2019t much I couldn\u2019t forgive you for after being fucked like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kisses Jaskier softly, and while his forgiveness is comforting, something still feels wrong. Not enough. Geralt knows before the loop is even over that it will not be the last, but he feels as though he\u2019s on the precipice, that he can see a lighthouse in the distance though he\u2019s still out at sea.</p>\n<p>Before the final night of the one-hundred and twentieth loop, Geralt retraces his steps backward. All the ways Jaskier had tried or succeeded to confess his feelings. The things Geralt had said or never succeeded in saying back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The realization creeps up slowly, coming to stand beside him without making a single sound: waking up without Jaskier in his arms is torture. He wants to live a brand new day with Jaskier, to build memories together for better or worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt wants to be the person Jaskier deserves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The morning of the one-hundred and twenty-first loop, Geralt decides that today he\u2019s going to get things absolutely, breathtakingly right. Determination he\u2019d not even felt during the early loops overtakes him from the moment his eyes snap open on the dawn of the dragon rescue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Jaskier can finish saying his usual, \u201cRise and shine, Geralt. What a beautiful day to slay a dragon,\u201d he yanks Jaskier into his room, tells him about the loop, fucks him silly and proceeds to do so again and again on their way up the mountain. This time, when the sound of the bugles rings out into the air, it feels like a promise instead of a threat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He saves the hirikka from Sir Eyck and even makes one final, generous go at saving the sack of shit Sir Eyck himself. The moron manages to trip over his own feet and hit his head against an unfortunately placed rock. <em> Fuck it, </em> Geralt thinks, <em> you can\u2019t win them all. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt has the best version of all his talks with Yennefer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tells her about Jaskier, about the Child Surprise, about the wish he\u2019d made to the djinn, about how in all the loops he\u2019s tried, things never quite feel right between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI may regret the...phrasing of my wish. But I\u2019m glad to have you in my life, Yennefer of Vengerberg,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou will always be important to me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, your wish tied our fates together, so I doubt this is the last we\u2019ll see of each other,\u201d she mutters, arms crossed, but it looks like she might be trying not to cry. Before he leaves, she says, \u201cYou know, someone once asked me to leave with them, and I didn\u2019t when I think perhaps I should have. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Together, they save the dragon\u2019s egg and there is no argument after, only a gentle parting of ways.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the loop draws to its close, when it is just Geralt and Jaskier on the mountain top, this time Geralt moves towards Jaskier whose eyes burn with hope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve broken your spell?\u201d Jaskier cocks his head to the side, the wind blowing his hair in front of his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt knows in his bones that this moment is the one, and he\u2019s going to make it count.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite yet.\u201d Geralt takes a step towards Jaskier and goes still and utterly silent, his eyes wide. Geralt\u2019s had about a year to work himself up to this, there\u2019s no turning back now. \u201cOn the first day, you told me that you\u2019d been trying to figure out what pleases you. You asked me if I know what pleases me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Jaskier swallows. \u201cKnow what pleases you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt knows he will never relive this day, this hour, this minute, this moment, ever again so he drinks Jaskier in. The way he squares his jaw and doesn\u2019t look away from Geralt. The way his eyes are blue and beautiful and full of a yearning Geralt had been too afraid to truly see before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are what pleases me,\u201d Geralt says, his voice low and forceful. Fuck if he\u2019s more afraid than he\u2019s ever been and also more certain. \u201cYou make otherwise insufferable days bearable. You make me <em> happy. </em>I never want you to forget that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words have barely wrestled their way out of Geralt when Jaskier is fisting his hands in his shirt and kissing him for all he\u2019s worth. He has never been kissed like this before. Like he is everything in this world that matters. That he belongs so fully to someone\u2019s heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time he makes his way down the mountain slowly, stopping more often than not to kiss Jaskier breathless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning comes and the one after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long did you say we were in that loop?\u201d Jaskier asks. He\u2019s lounging on his bedroll, the early morning sun just beginning to kiss his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a year, give or take.\u201d Geralt continues sharpening his steel sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll indulge me, Geralt, let me check my understanding. This means I\u2019ve skipped a year, give or take, of you dithering about, trying to determine what you feel for me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You could say that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Yennefer of Vengerberg is not going to try to murder me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne can never be sure, but likely no.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier stands and picks up his lute. \u201cIt\u2019s the most bafflingly incredible thing that\u2019s ever happened. The <em> story </em>here, I mean. I always thought a sex curse of some sort would be fun, but this? This makes for fantastic material.\u201d He starts plucking at a few notes, humming to himself. He looks back up at Geralt. \u201cYesterday you were indifferent and today you\u2019re in love with me. I mean, it\u2019s mind-bogglingly fantastic.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A labored sigh escapes him. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I\u2019d describe it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Geralt sees the moment Jaskier hears his words, the doubt that flickers through his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been indifferent to you,\u201d he says pointedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jaskier pauses his ministrations on his lute. \u201cThank you for the clarification.\u201d He thinks for a moment, chewing at his lower lip. \u201cThis will all take some getting used to for me since I\u2019m afraid you have an advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome might argue that I needed to play with a handicap,\u201d Geralt says wryly. He sheaths his sword and reaches out a hand. \u201cPut that down and come here. I\u2019ll show you some more things I learned over the past year.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Jaskier, he feels afraid, slipping off that ship in a storm again. He thinks, though, that he doesn\u2019t want anyone to yank him back to safety this time. That he\u2019d happily go crashing down into the restless waves below.\u00a0</p>"
