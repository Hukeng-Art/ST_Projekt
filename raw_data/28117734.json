  "text": "<p>The Christmas party at Sirus\u2019 work never ends well. He has no idea what actually goes on there, and he has no desire to find out, but Harry has learnt from experience that most employees head home at two in the morning, utterly wasted, and they probably don\u2019t feel normal again for another three days. Every year without fail, Harry gets a call in the early hours from a drunk and disorderly Sirius, asking for a lift home because he can\u2019t figure out how to uncross his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But not this year. This year, Harry has the house to himself, because <em> this </em>year is The Year Without Booze - otherwise known as the Year of the Riddle. Harry is pretty sure he\u2019s heard Sirius complain more about his new boss this past year than he\u2019s ever complained about anything before. He\u2019s rich. He\u2019s an asshole. He\u2019s overbearing and demanding and just plain rude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most importantly, he\u2019s a killjoy, and there will absolutely not be any getting wasted at this year\u2019s Christmas party.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has never been so relieved. He\u2019s had an awful day, and he never wants to leave the house again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to have a lot more awful days these next couple of weeks, because the lead up to Christmas is always their busiest time. Their Christmas display is pretty awesome, and it attracts even the Scrooges of the town, but it\u2019s a bitch to organise and an even bigger bitch to run. If he has to sweep up one more broken bauble he\u2019s going to burst into tears on the spot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is why he\u2019s so looking forward to his night alone. He loves living with Sirius, and he\u2019ll always be grateful that the man opened his home to an unruly teenager he barely knew all those years ago, but it\u2019s nice to have some privacy every now and then. Harry is excited to have a night to himself - he\u2019s got Netflix set up in front of him, a hot chocolate cooling down on the coffee table and an overflowing bowl of buttery popcorn just calling to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the phone rings. Harry\u2019s heart sinks. Whoever is on the other line is not going to be the bearer of good news.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d Harry says dubiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry? Harry, is that you?\u201d Sirius shouts. The buzz of Christmas music in the background is nowhere near loud enough to warrant that kind of volume.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else would it be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes. Clearly, Sirius did not stick to this year\u2019s sobriety pact, so he takes pity on him and says, \u201cYes, Sirius, this is Harry. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Sirius pants. \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2013 a little\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrunk?\u201d He guesses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. Listen, somebody\u2013 I think somebody spiked the punch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god. Are you <em> twelve?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRiddle\u2019s <em> really </em>pissed,\u201d Sirius says, and there\u2019s a comically loud \u2018shh\u2019 on the other end of the line. It would be just like Sirius to start talking about somebody without even noticing they were in the room with him. \u201cHe might kill me, Harry. Can you\u2013 listen, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll make it up to you, but could you please come pick me up? I\u2019ll owe you one, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius, you promised,\u201d Harry sighs, fully aware that he sounds like a whining child. He casts a mournful look over his cosy living room set up, which he\u2019ll undoubtedly have to abandon in favour of picking Sirius up and putting him to bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, kiddo. But I might die. You\u2019d never find my body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> are </em>twelve,\u201d Harry says grumpily. And then, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Phoenix building is just as intimidating as it\u2019s always been. Harry - and Sirius, and probably everyone else that worked there - had hoped that it might have had a revamp when Riddle took the company over. New management usually means a makeover, and they had been hoping for something a little more homely and a little less depressing-grey-cold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No such luck. If anything, it\u2019s become\u00a0<em>more </em> intimidating, because Riddle is an intimidating person. Or so Sirius says. Harry has never actually met the man, but he feels like he knows him intimately what with how often Sirius comes home bitching about him. He isn\u2019t looking forward to going inside - his first foray into the building since Riddle took over - but maybe, if he\u2019s lucky, he\u2019ll be in and out without ever having to see the man. <em> That </em> would be a Christmas miracle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Technically, nobody is allowed past the first level unless they\u2019re an employee. There\u2019s always a bodyguard or two waiting to check people\u2019s ID to make sure no one slips through the cracks, but Harry has been friends with Hagrid for almost as long as he\u2019s been alive and he knows the man will let him through without a fuss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls his hood up against the wind as he hops out of his car. It\u2019s bitterly cold in December but it stubbornly refuses to snow; sleet and slush gurgle underfoot and Harry winces. He\u2019s wearing canvas shoes, and now his socks are wet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally getting inside is a relief, despite how unfriendly the building is overall. A rush of warm air warms the pink tip of his nose and he shudders, blowing into his hands. At the end of the hallway, Hagrid stands up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he says, as though it\u2019s been five minutes since they last saw each other and not almost a year. \u201cThank god you\u2019re here. Sirius has been calling every two minutes, asking if you\u2019ve arrived yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTypical.\u201d Harry rolls his eyes. \u201cI bet he was the one that spiked the punch in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to have a killer hangover when he wakes up tomorrow,\u201d Hagrid says, and Harry snorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cServes him right. I better go on up, then. It was nice to see you, Hagrid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pauses for a brief hug - Hagrid always gives the best hugs, even if they are a little bone crushing - and then hurries towards the elevator. The doors are open and there\u2019s a man already inside; when he sees Harry hurtling towards him, he merely frowns and sticks a hand out to stop the doors from closing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry offers, although the man doesn\u2019t look at him. Harry bristles a little and his shoulders stiffen. Alright then. He can be rude if he wants to be, Christmas spirit be damned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an awkward elevator ride. Harry fidgets the whole way to the top floor, painfully aware of how still and silent the man next to him is. By the time the lift finally comes to a stop, he\u2019s thoroughly uncomfortable and brimming with irritation at the evening\u2019s turn of events. Sirius is <em> really </em> going to owe him one now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t bother saying goodbye to the man as he goes to leave. He\u2019s drawn to the telltale sounds of laughter and distant Christmas music, but before he can get very far a hand latches around his wrist, gentle but firm, and Harry freezes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man is looking right at him, eyebrows furrowed, lips pursed. He\u2019s attractive, Harry thinks absently, and hates the way his face heats at the observation. Neatly coiffed hair and an expensive suit almost make up for the derisive sneer on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry says. He tugs on his wrist a little and the man blinks, let\u2019s go as if he hadn\u2019t even realised he was still holding on. His touch leaves a burning circle around Harry\u2019s wrist like a brand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Hagrid let you in?\u201d He asks suddenly, and Harry blanches. It\u2019s against company policy to let in random strangers off the street, probably even more so at two in the morning, and the man could be in serious trouble if this prick reported back to Riddle. Harry presses his lips into a thin line and crosses his arms stubbornly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to pick someone up,\u201d he explains. His skin prickles with the way this man is looking at him and he rubs the back of his neck to calm down. He looks ridiculously out of place here, in tracksuits and a hoodie and a pair of tatty blue sneakers that he got when he was fifteen. Next to Harry, the man seems positively regal and clearly he\u2019s thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t work here,\u201d he says, dragging his eyes up and down Harry\u2019s body in a slow once-over. \u201cI\u2019d remember you.\u201d Harry shuffles his feet and, for some reason, the movement makes the man smirk. Harry\u2019s cheeks flame. <em> Fuck </em> this guy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be in and out,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cI won\u2019t cause any problems, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t,\u201d the man mutters. He seems to be weighing something up, and Harry knows when he comes to a decision because his eyes snap back into sharp focus and he holds out his arm, a bizarre offering. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you. I was heading that way myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry considers objecting, telling the man that he already knows his way around the building, but it probably wouldn\u2019t do to tell him that this is not Hagrid\u2019s first transgression so he keeps his mouth shut. He lays his hand over the back of the man\u2019s wrist and feels a little pretentious doing so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA shame you\u2019ve had to come all the way out, Mr\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes an embarrassingly long moment for Harry to realise that the man is waiting for his name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d he blurts out, far more information than he\u2019d been planning to give. \u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter.\u201d He says it slowly, purposefully, tasting the words on his tongue and testing the way they feel in his mouth. Harry feels a swoop of something warm and enticing in his belly and very firmly pushes all bad-thoughts away. He\u2019s just here to collect Sirius, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Harry asks, tone vaguely challenging. He tilts his chin up and sees Tom\u2019s eyes flash with barely contained glee. He hasn\u2019t expected such a visceral reaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d he says, and offers nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walk in silence some more. Harry should probably jerk away from Tom\u2019s arm, but he likes the way the silky material feels under his fingertips. He\u2019s aware of Tom watching him through narrowed eyes, assessing him. It\u2019s unsettling, but he won\u2019t allow himself to cringe away or falter. He keeps his jaw set tight and stares straight ahead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you here to collect?\u201d Tom asks, suspiciously casual. \u201cAnyone I\u2019d know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you know,\u201d Harry snaps, barely concealing his panic. He\u2019s pissed at Sirius, but he doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to him and get him in trouble. They\u2019ve been struggling with rent enough as it is - Harry leaving school had helped; he\u2019s managed to get a few odd shifts at cafes and bars but nothing steady enough to make a comfortable difference - and the last thing they need is Sirius wallowing in dismal unemployment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Tom only laughs, a deep, rich laugh like melted chocolate. Harry scowls, because it should <em> not </em>be so arousing just listening to someone laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you always this prickly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth falls open. He\u2019s used to being insulted to his face, what with his childhood being what it was, but he thought fancy businessmen like this might have more restraint. Maybe it\u2019s only worth being polite to other people in suits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> not </em>prickly.\u201d Harry glowers, and then turns away sharply when he realises that he might be proving Tom\u2019s point. \u201cIt\u2019s just late, and I\u2019m tired and pissed off that I have to play babysitter for a grown man. Alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom is silent for a moment, eyes narrowed and calculating. Then he asks, with a laughable faux nonchalance, \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is so horrified by the implication that his head whips around to glare at Tom, and in a rare display of clumsiness, bashes his shoulder into the doorframe. He had been paying so little attention to his surroundings, caught up in Tom and his infuriatingly handsome face, that he had tried to fit through the doorway at the same time as Tom. He hisses through his teeth and grabs his arm, where he\u2019s sure he\u2019ll have a bruise tomorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tom asks, body turned to face him completely. He\u2019s suddenly very intense, eyes focused, mouth set in a determined line. Harry startles when something brushes his hand, but Tom\u2019s fingers are so surprisingly gentle that he doesn\u2019t mind showing the man his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says softly, overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bruise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Tom says, which isn\u2019t an answer but still somehow reeks of finality. His hand slips down further to cup Harry\u2019s elbow, and he isn\u2019t can\u2019t keep up the excuse of checking for injuries anymore but Harry still lets it happen. He doesn\u2019t know why. He\u2019s too breathless to complain - Tom\u2019s touch is heady and a fog of arousal clouds his mind. It comes so unexpectedly that Harry inhales sharply and jerks backwards, out of Tom\u2019s grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> fine,\u201d </em>he says again, and feels a flush creep up his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom takes half a step backwards like he knows his close proximity makes Harry nervous. He doesn\u2019t look flustered at all, his suit isn\u2019t rumpled and his hair is still held perfectly in place. He\u2019s a gorgeous prick and Harry hates him instantly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except that, clearly, he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019 voice takes them both by surprise, and Harry jumps. He probably looks like he did when he was a kid, and Sirius caught him doing something he wasn\u2019t supposed to do. Harry wonders if the guilt is written clearly on his face, or if Tom won\u2019t be able to tell. God, he hopes Tom can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s not like Harry <em> cares. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Black,\u201d Tom says before Harry can think of an appropriate response, and there is a definite curl to his lip that has both Harry and Sirius bristling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Riddle,\u201d Sirius says back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Riddle, </em> Harry thinks. <em> Tom Riddle. As in, CEO-of-the-company Tom Riddle. Holy </em>fuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Harry blurts out, the panic in his voice verging on hysterical. \u201cSirius, come on. We have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom turns to Harry again with an arched eyebrow and, okay, that is <em> definitely </em>a sneer. \u201cSirius Black?\u201d He says, and whilst Harry doesn\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s asking, he can tell it\u2019s something offensive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to have met you,\u201d he says icily, secretly proud he was able to keep his composure long enough to get the words out. \u201cBut we have to go. Sirius, come <em> on.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius stumbles forward a few feet and Harry rushes forward to catch him so he doesn\u2019t faceplant at Tom\u2019s feet. A cocktail of guilt and irritation churns in his stomach - he\u2019d feel pretty bad if Sirius ended up hurting himself, but he\u2019s still annoyed that he had to come out in the first place, and now he\u2019s annoyed that he\u2019s got a crush on Insufferable Tom Riddle, the boss from hell. All in all, he is not having a good evening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Mr Black,\u201d Tom sniffs. \u201cI trust you\u2019ll be in bright and early tomorrow morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, yes sir.\u201d Sirius couples the words with a mocking salute, and Harry elbows him in the side. Harry doesn\u2019t want the idiot to get himself fired on his watch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A muscle in Tom\u2019s jaw tics, the only indication of his bad temper, but for whatever reason his whole face changes when his gaze slides to Harry. His eyes soften and his lips twist into a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnchanted to meet you,\u201d he says, and even inclines his head in some ridiculous bow. \u201cUntil next time, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he brushes past Sirius without another word, his heels clicking against the floor as he walks. Harry doesn\u2019t mean to, but he strains to hear anything else, to see if the music will dim or if Tom will break up the party.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Sirius is already starting to droop in his arms and Harry doesn\u2019t want to get home too late, so he heaves a sigh and trudges back towards the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home. And tomorrow we can have a <em> serious </em>talk about the importance of keeping your promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius hiccups. Harry rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he want?\u201d Sirius asks suddenly, way too loud in Harry\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did Riddle want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry bites his lip. What <em> did </em>Tom want? He hadn\u2019t asked for anything, except to know who Harry was there for, and he hadn\u2019t flown into a rage when Harry had avoided answering. At the end, it seemed like he was seconds away from kissing Harry\u2019s hand. It was almost like he just wanted to talk\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Everything Sirius says about Riddle makes him sound like the world\u2019s biggest asshole, and Harry doesn\u2019t think some corporate yuppie like him would hang around at gone two in the morning for a friendly chat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, he probably had an evil plan, and Harry probably escaped it by getting out of there early. He\u2019ll just have to stay away from Tom, from the building, from the entire street if necessary, because he is Harry Potter, and men in suits don\u2019t frighten him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter how handsome they are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKitchen!\u201d He calls back, not turning away from the oven. He\u2019s not going to risk burning tonight\u2019s dinner when he\u2019s worked on it all afternoon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius appears a moment later, smiling fondly at the sight of Harry in a hoodie and jeans. He probably looks just like his father, Harry thinks, and the thought warms him. Sirius leans against the doorframe and crosses his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBad day?\u201d Harry asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAverage day,\u201d Sirius answers, giving a half hearted shrug. Then his mouth twists unpleasantly and he eyes Harry sidelong. \u201cDo my memories deceive me, or were you talking to Riddle the other day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blanches. Trying his very best not to show his discomfort on his face he turns back to the hob and stirs the soup. \u201cYou mean at your Christmas party?\u201d He asks casually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm. Unless you\u2019ve been sneaking in during my lunch break to speak to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Harry scoffs. \u201cI had\u2013 a very brief conversation with him, before I knew who he was. I thought he was very rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius relaxes. \u201cHe is,\u201d he agrees, eager to jump on any Riddle-bashing opportunity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry should let him, should be thankful for the distraction and push Tom out from his mind, but he can\u2019t. Curiosity burns in his chest and ties knots in his stomach. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d He says, very casually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs deeply. \u201cHe cornered me this morning,\u201d Sirius explains, and Harry looks round, alarmed. \u201cCame and sat by my cubicle. He\u2026 asked about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry forces himself to act natural. Sirius would feel so betrayed if he knew about Harry\u2019s pathetic schoolboy crush, so he does his best to seem unaffected. Tom asked about him? What did he want to know? And <em> why? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Harry asks eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Sirius flashes him a grin, completely misunderstanding. \u201cOnly that you live with me, and where you\u2019re working. He seemed very interested. I wouldn\u2019t have told him anything if I could have gotten away with it, but\u2026\u201d he spreads his hands helplessly, and Harry smiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Sirius. What harm can he do with that, anyway? Now, come sit down. I made soup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019 eyes flick down to the saucepan, and then back up to Harry with a wary caution. \u201cRight\u2026\u201d he says slowly. \u201cShould I order pizza?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Riddle can do a lot of damage with not much information. Harry finds this out the next day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is balancing precariously on a small stool, stretched onto his tiptoes to try and hang a straggly piece of tinsel over the door to the men\u2019s bathroom, when somebody sneaks up behind him. He doesn\u2019t hear them coming, nor does he sense the looming presence at his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d somebody says, voice sinfully low and rumbly, right into his ear. Harry shrieks and completely loses his balance. His foot slips and he topples forward. He would have smacked his nose into the wall as well, if it wasn\u2019t for the sneak-attacker catching him around the waist with two strong arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry holds his breath. He finds his footing and, when the customer still doesn\u2019t let go, he turns around in their arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Tom Riddle is staring back at him. And, of course, he looks stupidly attractive. He\u2019s wearing a deep green sweater and black slacks. A stray curl hangs over his forehead and the watch he\u2019s wearing - the one Harry can feel pressing into his lower back, where his spine dips - probably costs more than Harry makes a year. He smells <em> fantastic, </em>Harry is distressed to note, like spices and cinnamon and Christmas. Double fuck this guy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom murmurs. \u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry gulps and shoves Tom\u2019s hands off him. One had been curled around his waist, the other firmly covering his back, his little finger settled over the curve of his ass. Harry\u2019s whole face is on fire. He takes a steadying breath and hops down from the stool, even though it makes him even shorter than Tom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Harry says rudely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom blinks. He gestures around the shop. \u201cI was just\u2026 enjoying the display. I didn\u2019t know you worked here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry scowls. \u201cSirius told you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou asked him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom is quiet for a moment, and Harry begins to worry that he\u2019s made a terrible mistake. Riddle isn\u2019t crazy enough to fire Sirius for something like this, is he? Maybe Harry should have kept his mouth shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then a gleeful smile spreads across his face and he inclines his head, just a little, in acquiescence. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m here to see you. Is that so terrible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry crosses his arms, and then just as quickly drops them to his sides, looking around to make sure his supervisor didn\u2019t see that. The last thing he needs is Tom getting him in trouble for having an attitude with a customer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do you want to see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom smiles again, all teeth and dripping charm and predatory. \u201cTo get your recommendation, of course.\u201d He holds up two painted baubles. \u201cRed or green?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. \u201cWhat colour are your other decorations?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stops. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t celebrate Christmas. It\u2019s a pointless holiday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry splutters. <em> \u201cA pointless\u2013 </em> it\u2019s <em> fun. </em>Fun doesn\u2019t have to have a point!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom frowns, puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s fun about it?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get to spend time with family and friends. You get to eat cool food. Giving gifts is fun. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s a nice time of year, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom tilts his head. \u201cAre you a religious person, Harry?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry tries not to choke on his own tongue at the way his name sounds in Tom\u2019s mouth. \u201cWell, no,\u201d he says. And then, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom shakes his head. \u201cSo really, you could do all those things any time of the year. There\u2019s nothing inherently special about Christmas. It\u2019s just a lot of hype for one meaningless day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry grits his teeth and narrows his eyes. \u201cWhy are you buying Christmas decorations if you don\u2019t celebrate Christmas?\u201d He asks. \u201cDid you just come to bully me for being silly and sentimental?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom laughs, and it\u2019s such an unexpected reaction that a sliver of pride lodges itself in Harry\u2019s chest. He does his best to ignore it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he says. And then, bizarrely, \u201cMr Black is forty one. I checked. How old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d Now that he knows Tom doesn\u2019t actually want to buy anything, he turns his back on him. His supervisor won\u2019t mind so much if he ignores time wasters, and he has to get this stool back into the supply cupboard before the afternoon rush hits. He bends down to pick it up, and freezes when he feels the solid warmth of Tom\u2019s body pressed to his back. Tom\u2019s hand curls around the edge of the stool, his thumb brushing Harry\u2019s little finger, and it feels like the most natural thing in the world to let go of it and allow Tom to carry it for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, once he\u2019s done it, a wave of humiliation crashes over him. What is he doing? He\u2019s perfectly capable of taking care of himself, doing his own work. Riddle can fuck right off if he thinks otherwise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Tom asks, and Harry glowers at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom smirks and gives him a once over so obvious that it makes Harry shiver. \u201cI meant in general,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in university?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everyone wants to go to uni, Riddle.\u201d Harry tilts his chin up challengingly. \u201cSorry we can\u2019t all be rich and snobby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a terrible shame, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tom laughs at Harry\u2019s furious expression, and then looks down at the stool in his hand. \u201cWhere shall I put this?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight back where you found it. I can do my own work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you <em> can,\u201d </em> Tom says, and rounds on Harry with a stare that is frightening in its intensity. He looks <em> ravenous </em>. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have to. In fact, I\u2019d like it if you let me do something for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stares. His cheeks are flushed warm, eyes wide. He\u2019s sure he looks like an idiot, standing there with his mouth open, so turned on he can barely think straight. Tom, for one, looks thrilled at Harry\u2019s reaction. He brings his free hand up to Harry\u2019s face and strokes his cheek with his knuckles, tucks his hair behind his ear and legs his hand linger for far longer than necessary. Much to his shame, Harry\u2019s eyes flutter closed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only for a second, but it\u2019s long enough for Tom to know what he wants to know. He steps back, and Harry sucks in a gasping breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like older men, Harry?\u201d Tom asks, low and probing. It\u2019s a physical struggle, not to fall into his chest and breathe his scent in deep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Harry hisses, tearing himself away. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2013 you can\u2019t just\u2013 if you aren't going to buy something, Riddle, you can <em> fuck off.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom stands back, thankfully giving Harry\u2019s head some time to clear, and shrugs. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says, and picks up the red bauble. \u201cWalk with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s shoulders droop. He does his best to look miserable at the arrangement, whilst inside he\u2019s jumping up and down at the prospect of spending some more time with Tom. It\u2019s addictive, having the man\u2019s attention on him and him alone. He wonders what it would be like, to have someone take care of him the way Tom is saying someone should, is saying <em> he </em>should.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Harry blurts out before he can stop himself. Tom stills. He doesn\u2019t turn, but he watches Harry curiously over his shoulder. Harry clears his throat. \u201cYou should\u2013 you should get the green one. Suits you more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, Tom picks up the green one as well. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d he says with an easy shrug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walk in silence towards the tills. Harry keeps his head down, half because he\u2019s too embarrassed to even look at Tom and half so that he doesn\u2019t attract any difficult customers. Tom is close enough at his side to warn away trouble anyway, and his looming frame is threatening enough to have most people shying out of their way. If Harry had known all he had to do to be unapproachable was bulk up, he would have started working out years ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not really true either. It isn\u2019t just that Tom is tall or muscular. There\u2019s something else to him, some terrifying quality, a dangerous glint to his eye. That\u2019s what gives him power, Harry thinks, and he would be just as menacing if he was a foot shorter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has to get back to work, and now that Tom is in the queue there really is no excuse for Harry to still be hanging around. He stuffs his hands into his pockets and hopes he doesn\u2019t look too awkward when he shuffles backwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cWell, I should\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one short word. It really shouldn\u2019t have the effect it has, but Harry freezes. Instantly, his face flushes warm and his hands curl into fists. Why should <em> Riddle </em>be able to command him like he\u2019s some dog? Harry doesn\u2019t work for Tom, and he doesn\u2019t have to do what he wants, just because Tom is rich and powerful and thinks he deserves that reaction. So why did Harry just stop without thinking?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Tom can see the budding outrage in Harry\u2019s features, in the way his forehead creases, the way he pushes his glasses up his nose with a white knuckle, because he smiles gently. He doesn\u2019t even look at Harry\u2019s coworker as he pays, just hands over a ten pound note and accepts the change with an open palm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hands the red bauble to Harry, and keeps the green one for himself. \u201cHere,\u201d he says. \u201cI bought it for you. Now we can share something special.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is too dumbstruck to move, and too speechless to say anything. Tom smirks, far too self satisfied for Harry\u2019s liking, and reaches out. One hand curls carefully around Harry\u2019s wrist and, with a gentle touch, he closes Harry\u2019s fingers one by one around the red bauble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t celebrate Christmas,\u201d Harry says, and cringes when his voice breaks. He peers down at the bauble now in his hand and wonders idly if he has the willpower to reject it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Christmas isn\u2019t the only special thing, you know.\u201d He pushes Harry\u2019s glasses up his nose and then has the <em> audacity </em>to boop Harry\u2019s nose as he pulls away. Harry would snap at him if it hadn\u2019t been so fucking cute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Harry,\u201d Tom says like a promise. He leans down, kisses Harry\u2019s cheek, and then leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is left with one thought only: <em> what the fuck just happened? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t stop asking himself that, as much as he tries to forget about it altogether. Tom Riddle sticks in his mind for a shamefully long time. Whenever Harry starts to think that maybe he\u2019s forgetting about their encounter, he\u2019ll remember how close Tom was to him, how solid and strong he was when he caught Harry in his arms, how his stubble brushed against Harry\u2019s cheek when Tom kissed him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Do you like older men, Harry? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> That </em>thought stays with him as well, at night when he\u2019s in bed, trying to get to sleep. Does he? In truth, Harry doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s messed around with a few guys before - mostly in clubs as one night stands, or in school with the same jerks that would shoulder barge him in the hallway the next day - but he\u2019s never been in a long term relationship. How would he even know what he likes?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks he likes Tom. At least, physically. He has no idea how old the man is but the signs of his age aren\u2019t offputting at all. If anything, they make him more attractive; he\u2019s more confident, more sure of himself, and while that is absolutely infuriating when Harry has to actually talk to him, it does make him undeniably appealing. The way he carries himself, as though he knows how important he is and he expects others to show respect, has Harry weak at the knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, it\u2019s pathetic how Tom has him questioning so much about himself. The man is a <em> snob, </em>rich and entitled and rude, and yet Harry still wants to bury his face in Tom\u2019s chest again. He keeps the red bauble on his bedside table, and scowls at it every morning when he wakes up. It\u2019s embarrassing. If Sirius ever found out, he would never let Harry live it down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Harry decides he <em> has </em>to forget about Tom. Regardless of how hot he is, he\u2019s still just a guy, and Harry has turned guys down before. He can do it again, can just push Tom out of his head by focusing on work and getting the perfect Christmas present for Sirius.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, that\u2019s when the gifts start arriving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It starts off small, which is probably why Harry doesn\u2019t make such a big deal of it. When the postman hands him a small, square package that he definitely didn\u2019t order, he takes it with a grateful smile and a nervous anticipation growing in his chest. He doesn\u2019t recognise that handwriting, but somehow he just <em> knows. </em> Only Tom would write with that elegant cursive, that posh flick and curl to his letters. He runs his thumb over the ink, over his name in Tom\u2019s handwriting, and shivers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens it with caution, knee bouncing under his desk, and imagines Tom sitting somewhere similar, folding the corners down carefully, writing Harry\u2019s address on the front. He wonders if Tom packed it himself - he probably pays people to do that sort of thing for him, but Harry thinks maybe Tom would want to do this on his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It opens easily enough. Harry spares a thought to how expertly Tom has wrapped it. For a man that doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas, he sure has put a lot of effort into this. Something warm and satisfied blooms in Harry\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inside the box is a necklace, laid out on a black velvet background. It\u2019s a delicate thing, a small, black gem hanging on a silver chain. Harry doesn\u2019t wear jewellery often, but this is as beautiful as it is puzzling and he almost doesn\u2019t want to touch it, in case he damages it. The clasp is so small and fiddly, and Harry has never been particularly tactile. He could ask Sirius to help him put it on, but then he\u2019d have to explain where it came from, and how would he do that?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018No big deal, but your boss has been kind of stalking me and now he\u2019s buying me presents. Merry Christmas!\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry snorts. Yeah, that wouldn\u2019t go down well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closes the lid carefully with the necklace still inside and leaves the box by his bed. A note has fluttered down to the floor and Harry bends to pick it up. The writing here has the same distinguished flourish as it does on the box, and Harry\u2019s face splits with a grin as he pictures Tom leaving him a handwritten note. It\u2019s ridiculously sappy and sentimental for someone he barely knows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The note reads:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Dearest Harry, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The onyx stone is particularly beautiful, and means quite a bit to me. It reminded me of you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> All my love, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Tom\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry grabs the nearest pillow and hugs it to his chest, buries his face in it and smiles like an idiot. Particularly beautiful? Quite meaningful? And it reminded Tom of\u2026 him? Is he actually flirting with Harry? It had certainly seemed that way in the store, in a weird, stilted way, but seeing tangible proof of the man\u2019s affections is another thing entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Harry\u2019s smile dims, and his happiness darkens. That necklace is the perfect example of <em> tangible </em> proof. Does Tom think he can <em> buy </em>Harry? Is that what this is about? First the bauble and now the necklace, it can\u2019t be a coincidence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Riddle is rich, Harry tells himself, and he probably throws money away like this all the time. Harry isn\u2019t special, even though that note had seemed overwhelmingly personal. Maybe this is all a ploy to get dirt on Sirius, get a reason to fire him. That\u2019s way more likely than Tom actually being interested in someone like Harry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that Harry <em> is </em>interested, of course. Tom Riddle is a jerk, and this just proves that. Harry contemplates bursting into Tom\u2019s office to demand an explanation or - even though the thought has his shoulders sagging - giving the necklace back. He decides against it quickly - that won\u2019t be necessary. He had been really annoying at the store, and rude when Harry had gone to collect Sirius. It doesn\u2019t mean anything if he keeps the necklace as compensation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps he could go anyway, just to give a brisk <em> thank you, </em>but how would that even work? Would he just wander around the building, telling everybody he needs to see Big Scary CEO Tom Riddle and hiding his blush when they inevitably laugh at him. And what if Sirius caught him? There\u2019s no chance he could explain his way out of this one. He doesn\u2019t have Tom\u2019s address or phone number, so he has no other way of contacting him. Harry pointedly ignores the sharp twist in his stomach at the realisation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t matter. Tom can only have gotten <em> his </em>address by being a creeper and looking through Sirius\u2019 records anyway. Harry doesn\u2019t need to do anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tosses the pillow aside with a huff and heads downstairs. He\u2019s going to make a curry, and he is <em> not </em>going to think about Tom Riddle and his stupid, beautiful gift.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next gift comes two days later. Harry should have known it wouldn\u2019t stop with just one - Tom isn\u2019t the kind of man to do things in half measures. This time, a knock at the door has Harry rushing downstairs in his pyjamas to answer it. He looks side to side down the street but it\u2019s completely empty, no cars dawdling, no neighbours waving. Then he looks down at the doorstep, and sees another parcel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This one is bigger than the last, much bigger, and that familiar handwriting sprawls across a letter taped to the top. Harry gapes at it for a second, and then rushes out into the street with bare feet. He half expects to see Tom peering out from behind a tree, but there\u2019s still no one about. Harry scowls and folds his arms as he figures out what to do with this new gift. It was definitely hand delivered, and he snorts at the thought of Tom knocking on the door and then diving into a bush to hide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Realistically, he probably pays people to deliver weird gifts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, he takes it into the kitchen and plonks it down on the table. Giving it evil glares won\u2019t actually do anything, so he grabs a pair of scissors and cuts through the wrapping on the top.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s expecting, but it certainly isn\u2019t a cake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A <em> cake. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A fancy one, too, with pretty icing and edible flowers in a circle around the outside. Upon closer inspection, Harry sees that it's been placed on a bed of red rose petals. Not very practical, and not very platonic either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before, Harry had some room to kid himself. A necklace isn\u2019t necessarily a romantic gesture, and Harry had clung to a thin layer of denial. <em> This, </em>however, is undeniably, undoubtedly romantic, and he has no idea what to do with that knowledge. How could Tom ever be satisfied with Harry? He\u2019ll never live up to the man\u2019s ridiculous expectations, and if Tom only wants him around for an easy lay then that won\u2019t work out either. Harry isn\u2019t in the habit of sleeping with assholes. Not since secondary school, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever. He wouldn\u2019t even know what to say in response to this if Tom was right in front of him. Honestly, he\u2019s grateful for the excuse to think this over a little longer. He\u2019ll eat the cake - because the thought of good food going to waste still makes his chest clench uncomfortably - and as much as he doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019ll lie to Sirius about where it came from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The note, when Harry finally plucks up enough courage to read it, says only, <em> Almost as sweet as you - enjoy. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>By the time the third gift appears, Harry has had enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes, on a rare day off, to the deafening blast of a car horn. Feeling dazed, heart racing in his sudden panic, Harry leaps out of bed and dashes towards the window in time to see his neighbour gesturing angrily at a van driver, stopped in the middle of the road. The back of the van is open and another couple of workers are in the process of unloading something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right onto Harry\u2019s front lawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He frowns, eyebrows knitted together, as he tries to remember anything Sirius might have mentioned. He didn\u2019t say they were having any work done on the house, but it\u2019s not unlikely that he\u2019d have forgotten. Harry groans and pulls on a hoodie, shuffling down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, hello? Can I help you?\u201d He calls out. The men turn at the sound of his voice, but only one walks towards him. The other two continue unloading things. Now that he\u2019s closer and he has his glasses on, Harry can see that the indistinguishable objects are fancy clay pots filled with flowers. Lots of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou Harry Potter?\u201d The man asks, and Harry nods distractedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. What are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWinter wonderland.\u201d The man waves his hand dismissively and holds out a clipboard. \u201cSign here please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat?\u201d </em>Harry asks, but he takes the clipboard anyway, like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWinter wonderland,\u201d the man repeats, slowly now. \u201cIt\u2019s a landscape gardening thing. He didn\u2019t tell you we were coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t?\u201d Harry asks, but even as he says it the answer springs to mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who else would do something this needlessly dramatic? Who would be confident enough to send workmen to Harry\u2019s house without so much as a warning to do something that might not even be welcome?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s fists clench and he turns on his heel. The man behind him calls out in confusion, but Harry is on a mission. He has to contact Tom, and he <em> really </em>doesn\u2019t want to see him in person or he might lose any semblance of control. That only leaves one solution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rooting through the drawer of Sirius\u2019 work desk, Harry finds what he\u2019s looking for in the form of Sirius\u2019 contact details. He printed them out when Harry moved in all those years ago: he was only thirteen and Sirius felt awful that he wouldn\u2019t be there to take care of him when he got home from school. After a week of trying to persuade Sirius not to hire a babysitter, they finally compromised. Harry would stay at home on his own, as long as he promised to call Sirius if something happened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has Sirius\u2019 mobile number, his work number and his work email address. Everyone at the company has one, personalised only through first and last names. Maybe, if Harry is lucky, Tom Riddle will have one too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He copies the format into his laptop and sends off one single word that he really hopes will get the message across.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> STOP. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The winter wonderland is, to be fair, extremely beautiful. Snowdrops line the pathway up to the door and they\u2019ve even dotted some light-up candy canes across the garden. There\u2019s a blow-up snowman standing guard by the gate. Fairy lights twist over the archway of the door and cast soft, glowing tones of yellow and orange against the walls. Harry\u2019s heart aches with how pretty it is, and how much he wishes he could have organised it himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had approached the workmen when they were taking a quick coffee break and asked them how much it would all cost, with a kind of steely determination usually reserved for complaining customers. They had informed them with a lazy shrug that it had all already been paid for, and that he could relax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has never been further from relaxed than right now. Tom just replied to his email.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t bring himself to open it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s afraid of what Tom might have said. Harry told him to stop, but a tendril of anxiety slips through the cracks in his mask. If this email is an apology and a promise to leave him alone, Harry will be disappointed, and isn\u2019t that embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just\u2026 isn\u2019t used to gifts. He never got them with the Dursleys, and although he has Sirius now and a whole group of friends, celebrating the holiday was enough of a present on its own. Tom\u2019s shameless displays of wealth should anger him. They <em> definitely </em>shouldn\u2019t make his heart flutter with excitement. What\u2019s wrong with him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a heaving chest, Harry opens Tom\u2019s email and scans it greedily. He\u2019s looking for pet names, endearments, any signs of the flirtatious teasing that shone through on their two previous meetings. All these things, he should hate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I wondered how long it would take you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t you like snowdrops? Tell me your favourite flower and I\u2019ll have them change it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry gapes. Tom isn\u2019t sorry in the slightest. He doesn\u2019t understand how <em> weird </em>what he\u2019s doing is. He\u2019s not even considering listening to Harry, or following his instruction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grits his teeth and slams his laptop shut. Harry has gone crazy - Tom is ridiculous and stubborn and Harry was stupid to think otherwise. He\u2019s not going to dignify Tom with an answer; right now, he just needs to carry on with his life as normal and pretend that none of this weird, Christmas stalking is happening at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mission \u2018Ignore Tom Riddle\u2019 starts now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Mission \u2018Ignore Tom Riddle\u2019 ends the next day, when the man himself shows up at Harry\u2019s work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stops in the middle of the room with arms full of price labels, mouth hanging open. If possible, Tom looks even more attractive than before. He\u2019s wearing a white button up shirt with a green tie hanging loosely around his neck and black dress pants, as though he just got out of an important meeting. Unbidden, the image of Harry crawling into Tom\u2019s lap springs to mind, untucking that shirt from those trousers and tugging on Tom\u2019s tie until they\u2019re close enough to kiss. Harry\u2019s cheeks flare with heat and he glares, turning on his heel to storm away. It\u2019s been a long, bizarre week. Harry is allowed to be a little dramatic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom says, popping up at his side as though he just appeared there. Harry jerks in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2013\u201d he looks over his shoulder at where Tom was standing only a second ago, and then down at Tom\u2019s ridiculously long legs. It probably only took two or three big strides to cover the distance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d Tom says instead of answering, already reaching out to take some of the boxes from Harry\u2019s arms. Harry sidesteps him quickly, hugging them a little closer to his chest like he\u2019s trying to protect them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em> need </em>your help,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom watches him carefully for a moment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my email,\u201d he says eventually, voice carefully devoid of any emotion. Harry shrugs. He isn\u2019t going to be made to feel bad - he <em> isn\u2019t. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer mine,\u201d he says simply. \u201cNot really. I asked you to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t really want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry rounds on him then, pieces of paper flying over the sides of the box. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I want!\u201d He cries. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make decisions for me like that, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s mouth is tight and pinched, his shoulders pushed back so that his chest puffs out. Harry spares a weak moment to appreciate the sight he makes, before he looks around. From over Tom\u2019s shoulder, Harry can see his boss scowling at him, arms crossed over her chest, foot tapping the floor impatiently. He gulps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you before,\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t here to buy something, leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this, Tom seems to perk up. His shoulders relax a little and warmth creeps into his stoic features. \u201cI remember,\u201d he says with an ominous grin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I am here to buy something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry cocks an eyebrow. \u201cOh, really? What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to buy\u2026\u201d Tom\u2019s head turns quickly, scanning the room, and his eyes fall on the far wall. \u201cThat,\u201d he finishes, pointing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry follows his gaze. \u201cTinsel? You came to buy\u2026 tinsel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s face does a funny, displeased twitch before it smooths into his familiar, handsome smirk. \u201cYes,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cLots of it. Quite possibly the biggest purchase you\u2019ve ever had. I want all of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry dumps the box at his feet, just so he can cross his arms. \u201cYou want all of the tinsel,\u201d he says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry should have known Tom wouldn\u2019t back down from a challenge. At Harry\u2019s tilted chin and steely eyes, he seems to have become even more determined to follow through with this. Harry drops the stilted indifference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d He gestures wildly, exasperated. \u201cWhat\u2019s your aim here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom smiles. \u201cTinsel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievably annoying, do you know that?\u201d Tom doesn\u2019t reply to that, just tilts his head like Harry is a particularly interesting science experiment, so he heaves a sigh and turns to leave. \u201cFine,\u201d he says, waving his hand in the general direction of the tinsel. \u201cI\u2019ll pack that up for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom stops him with a gentle hand wrapped around his wrist. The small point of contact feels like a brand, and Harry shivers with how intensely Tom is watching him. For a moment, he thinks that Tom has reconsidered, that he\u2019s going to slink away without completing this silly game. He should have known that was an unrealistic goal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tom says softly. \u201cNot just that. <em> All </em>of it. Everything you have here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mind flits from thought to thought. \u201cBut\u2013 you can\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t\u2013 <em> no! </em>I can\u2019t sell you our entire stock! What could you possibly need that much tinsel for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom shrugs and inspects his nails. \u201cI have a big house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t celebrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom looks up sharply. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware one had to celebrate to make a purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry flushes warm and embarrassed. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013 no, of course you don\u2019t.\u201d How has Tom twisted this situation so completely? \u201cI just\u2026 can you tell me <em> why?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a fraction of a second, so briefly that Harry later thinks he imagined it, Tom\u2019s eyes soften. His smile flickers tender and unbearably fond. Then the familiarity is gone, replaced by a cool, smug satisfaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou work on commission, don\u2019t you, Mr Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, Harry doesn\u2019t understand. Commission? What? What does that have to do with anything? Then realisation washes over him in a cool, soothing wave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He works on commission - ten percent for every sale he organises. Ten percent of a sale this big would certainly be more than his Christmas bonus, and Tom must know that. He must, because why else would he come here to buy decorations that he has no intention of putting up?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that only leaves one more question; curiosity burns in Harry\u2019s throat, and he\u2019s anticipating the explosion before it happens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is <em> wrong </em>with you?\u201d He cries, arms flapping wildly. Tom doesn\u2019t look surprised, just amused and patient, as though Harry throwing a temper tantrum is just another obstacle to get past. That riles Harry up more than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Harry demands. \u201cThe gifts, the decorations\u2026 what are you hoping to achieve? Because I don\u2019t <em> owe </em>you anything, alright? I didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d Tom says quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not hoping to achieve anything, other than your happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sounds so painfully sincere that Harry\u2019s chest aches. He <em> can\u2019t </em>be serious. He just can\u2019t be - it makes no sense, when they hardly know each other, and the little knowledge Tom does have can hardly be endearing. Harry would be best to cut his losses while he still has the strength to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what would make me happy?\u201d Harry says. \u201cIf you stopped being weird, and you stopped sending me gifts I don\u2019t need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the mere mention of it, Tom\u2019s eyes flick down to Harry\u2019s neck. His pupils are dark and wide, suddenly hungry, and it takes Harry a moment to realise he\u2019s looking for the necklace. There\u2019s nothing to see though, only Harry\u2019s exposed skin, the column of his throat and the slightest hint of his collarbones. When he meets Harry\u2019s eyes again, he seems disappointed but no less intense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t a question. It\u2019s as though Tom has already decided the gifts were incorrect, and is thinking of ways to improve them. If Harry doesn\u2019t put a stop to this then it\u2019ll only get worse, and Tom will send more and more things in an attempt to find \u2018the perfect gift\u2019. Harry can\u2019t let that happen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, it seems cruel to let him think he got it wrong, when in reality Harry has treasured each new present with a force he didn\u2019t know was possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d he says softly, and without thinking, he lays his hand over Tom\u2019s forearm. Tom stiffens, frozen, and then a muscle in his jaw tics. At first Harry thinks he has crossed a boundary in touching Tom - then it dawns on him. Tom isn\u2019t angry or uncomfortable. Tom is strained, from holding back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wrenches his hand away, even though it hurts to do it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe gifts were lovely,\u201d he says finally, keeping his voice carefully distant. \u201cBut you\u2019ve given me enough now, and I don\u2019t want anymore. It\u2019s\u2026 inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something dark and indistinguishable flashes across Tom\u2019s face. His whole demeanour changes - in only a few seconds he\u2019s tightly coiled and simmering with barely restrained energy. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he says, voice clipped. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Tell me, what did Mr Black think of my gifts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s forehead creases in confusion. He doesn\u2019t know why Tom is asking about Sirius all of a sudden, but if it distracts him from the gentle rejection then he\u2019ll take it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 haven\u2019t told him,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI don't think he should find out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom sucks in a sharp breath, eyes wide, mouth slightly parted. His lips are damp, Harry notices. He wants to lick them himself, taste them, feel them against his own. <em> Christ.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tom breathes, mouth twisting into a smile. It\u2019s unnerving, and it leaves Harry with the distinct impression that he has said something important without realising it. Tom reaches up but hesitates with his fingers inches from Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cI see. Tell me, Harry, would you like to decorate with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry steps back. The conversation has taken a sudden, unexpected turn, and the proximity no longer feels necessary. He doesn\u2019t need to comfort Tom now that Tom is back to normal, and the thought shouldn\u2019t be as disappointing as it is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a big house. I\u2019m going to have a lot of work on my hands, what with all that.\u201d He jerks his head in the direction of the tinsel and Harry\u2019s heart sinks. He still means to go through with that? He\u2019s crazier than Harry first thought. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate a helping set of hands. I thought you might enjoy it. You like Christmas, don\u2019t you? I could put on some music. I could take you out to dinner afterwards, to say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s stomach rolls. All of this - every last bit: the gifts, the visits, the weird behaviour - has all been about getting him into bed. It\u2019s so clear now. Tom came here with the intention of getting Harry a huge commission, and then made it obvious he expects something in return. He\u2019s trying to <em> buy </em>him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s blood simmers with rage, and he bites his tongue until he tastes tangy copper. He has <em> never </em>met anyone so capable of getting under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says darkly, glowering. \u201cTake your gifts and your commission and your <em> stupid inflatable snowman </em> and <em> leave me alone.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t wait around. He catches a glimpse of Tom\u2019s open, shocked expression before he whirls around and marches towards the staff room, leaving the box of price labels abandoned in the middle of the floor. It\u2019s about time for his break, Harry thinks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gifts stop coming soon after that. He doesn\u2019t realise he misses them until he hears the retreating rumble of the postman driving away, and there is nothing with Tom\u2019s elegant, crawling handwriting left for him on the doorstep. He\u2019s an idiot, craving something he shouldn\u2019t want, but he can\u2019t help himself. He feels it like a physical pull, a rope wrapped tight in his chest, squeezing his heart every time Tom moves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When his paycheck comes in at the end of that month and Harry catches sight of the unnaturally large commission total, his stomach somersaults. It\u2019s a lot more than he usually makes, but not enough to suggest that Tom literally bought out the whole store.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That small concession is enough to make him smile. He sends of a quick email to Tom that says, <em> You shouldn\u2019t have, but thank you. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom sends one back that says, <em> Anything for you, my love, </em>and Harry rides that high for days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry is drenched before he even reaches the pavement. It\u2019s an awful evening - if the weather was going to be terrible, couldn\u2019t they at least have had some snow? - and Harry is shivering even with his hood pulled up. He clutches his coat together at the front because the zip has been broken for months, and cringes as he steps in a puddle. Dirty water splashes up his leg and soaks through his shoe. Fucking great - just what he needed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t often that he takes afternoon shifts at the cafe. He\u2019s usually working at the display at this time of day, so he misses out on the stressful lunch rush. Today was an exception. He\u2019d agreed to cover a shift, and though he could use the money, he found himself regretting it half an hour in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever. He pushes the memory away and trudges home. It\u2019s over, and he doesn\u2019t have any shifts scheduled there until after Christmas, which is a relief. He can\u2019t wait to have a shower and crawl into bed. Somehow, the chill in the air has crept into his bones and he wants to stand under the warm spray of water until it\u2019s all washed away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He barely even notices the car idling next to him until the window rolls down. He startles, taking a few staggering steps backwards. He\u2019s a little old to be kidnapped now, but it never hurts to take precautions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he actually looks at the car, and the person in it. Of fucking course Tom drives a Bentley.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Tom says, beckoning Harry closer. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk home in this.\u201d He glances up at the dark sky and frowns. His sleeves are pushed up to his elbows and Harry\u2019s eyes dart to his hands where they\u2019re wrapped around the steering wheel, long fingers curled, tapping impatiently. His mouth feels suddenly dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d Harry replies weakly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom laughs. \u201cSure.\u201d He tilts his head, bemused. \u201cGet in the car, Harry. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, thank you,\u201d Harry sniffs. He turns and continues walking, but Tom dawdles behind him, never once letting Harry out of his sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d he tries next. \u201cYou could get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown man,\u201d Harry snaps. \u201cPerfectly capable of taking care of myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, but I\u2019d still rather you let me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stops, pulse racing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take care of you, Harry,\u201d Tom says, voice deep and soothing. Harry wants to lay his head against Tom\u2019s chest and listen to the rumble of his words. \u201cWill you let me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens and shuts his mouth a few times. Nobody has ever said that before. At least, not with Tom\u2019s intentions. Sirius said that he would take care of Harry when they first met, when Harry was thirteen and scared and still reeling from his sudden departure from the Dursleys. That felt warm, safe, like the comforting weight of a blanket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an entirely different sensation. This feels burning hot and dangerous and exciting. He <em> wants. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2013\u201d he clears his throat and wets his lips. \u201cOkay. Yes. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sliding into the passenger seat of Tom\u2019s car is a relief. A burst of warm air has him sighing happily, even though he feels bad about getting Tom\u2019s fancy car dirty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about the seats,\u201d he says, but Tom shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re nothing,\u201d he says, and Harry hears the unspoken meaning. <em> They\u2019re nothing, and you\u2019re\u2026 more. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It just doesn\u2019t make any sense to him. All the confusion and anger and longing of the past few weeks culminate in a sad, pathetic groan. Harry drops his head into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d he says pitifully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom glances his way, but quickly looks back to the road. Harry supposes that should be a relief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll these gifts. Being nice to me. You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a point here, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s fists clench. \u201cMy point is,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy me. Alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom is quiet, and after a few silent moments it becomes obvious he isn\u2019t going to reply. This is even more infuriating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry continues. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep with you just because you\u2026 buy me things, alright? You can\u2019t win my affections with money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s knuckles turn white around the steering wheel. He\u2019s clenching his jaw so tight that a vein throbs in his temple. When he speaks, his words are quiet and careful, restrained, not at all his usual drawl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what can I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you have me do, Harry? How can I win your affections, if not like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry bites his lip and clasps his hands in his lap. He hadn\u2019t been expecting Tom to actually ask that. He didn\u2019t think Tom was <em> serious </em>about this. If he hasn\u2019t lost interest after everything Harry said, then maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could just\u2026 talk?\u201d Harry suggests. \u201cI\u2019ll give you my number.\u201d And then, because he realises he\u2019s being a bit presumptuous, \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the tension drains from Tom\u2019s shoulders. He eyes Harry with the faintest hint of a smile. \u201cI would,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry smiles warmly. He lets out a breath, and a bubble bursts in his chest, a sudden release of pressure that he hadn\u2019t known was there. He reaches into his pocket for his phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then tries the other one when he can\u2019t find it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he tries his jeans pockets instead, and it isn\u2019t there either. With a dawning sense of dread, Harry thinks about his locker at work, where he usually keeps his phone and his house keys. He drops his head back against the headrest with a groan and presses his knuckles against his eyelids.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom asks, sounding suddenly alarmed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI left my phone at work,\u201d Harry says. \u201cAnd my keys. Sirius is at work until five. I won\u2019t be able to get in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thinking about home, Harry realises that Tom hadn\u2019t even asked for his address. He knows it already, obviously, but perhaps it should be concerning that he just seems to know where to go without being told.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry pushes the thought aside. He can worry about that another time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tom hums. Then, \u201cWould you like me to turn around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t bother. But thank you,\u201d Harry adds hastily. \u201cThe cafe closes early today. It\u2019ll be locked by now. I\u2019ll have to go back tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could find a way around that,\u201d Tom says, and Harry glares suspiciously. He doesn\u2019t know whether Tom means smashing the windows or picking the lock, or maybe even ringing up Harry\u2019s boss and getting him down here, but it doesn\u2019t matter. All those options are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he replies carefully. \u201cIf\u2026 maybe, if I could visit Sirius at work, I could borrow his keys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes dart to Tom to scope out his reaction. He\u2019s reluctant to bring up Sirius in front of the man, because it\u2019s obvious he dislikes him for whatever reason. As he\u2019d expected, Tom\u2019s lips press into a thin line.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says sharply, and then swallows. Harry watches his throat bob with the motion. \u201cMr Black is\u2026 very busy at work. He couldn\u2019t possibly take a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be very quick,\u201d Harry says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even have to leave his desk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not possible, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry scoffs and slumps back in his seat, crossing his arms. He\u2019s absolutely <em> not </em> sulking, but if he was, Tom would deserve it. \u201cFine,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI\u2019ll sit on the doorstep and catch a cold, like you said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2013\u201d Tom sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cI was going to suggest you come home with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. \u201cUm. What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil\u2026 <em> Sirius </em>finishes work.\u201d He says Sirius\u2019 name with a mocking snarl, but Harry is too shocked to pay much attention. \u201cYou could dry off, relax for a bit. I would take you home when Mr Black\u2019s shift is over.\u201d They pause at a red light and it gives Tom the opportunity to study Harry in detail, his wide eyes, his wet hair. He probably looks like a drowned rat, but Tom simply smiles. He leans over and brushes away a strand of wet hair that was clinging to Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m only offering out of the kindness of my heart, of course,\u201d Tom says with a crooked, handsome smirk. \u201cNo funny business. Scout\u2019s honour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Completely lost for words, Harry blurts out, \u201cYou were <em> not </em>a Boy Scout.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom laughs incredulously. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, and shakes his head indulgently. \u201cI most certainly was not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be long,\u201d Harry says, mostly to himself. \u201cJust an hour or so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026 we\u2019ll just stick to normal, boring conversations?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can talk about the horrible weather,\u201d Tom tells him. \u201cOr yesterday\u2019s paper. I still haven\u2019t solved that crossword.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer sudoku myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom cups Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhat will it be, then? My house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry purses his lips and tries his best not to lean into the touch. \u201cIf it\u2019s that or pneumonia,\u201d he says diplomatically. \u201cI suppose your house will do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom wasn\u2019t kidding before. He <em> does </em> have a big house, except that maybe <em> big </em>is an understatement. He lives in a mansion. An actual, real life mansion that looks like it came straight out of a nineteenth century horror movie about dead Victorian twins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom parks on the driveway, tucked right up to the front door. Behind them, the gates begin to close on their own, and a little to the right a marble statue spouts water. Harry feels like he\u2019s stepped into another reality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little much, I know,\u201d Tom says. \u201cBut it was the closest house I have to yours. I thought you might appreciate a shorter journey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry splutters. \u201cYou have <em> more </em>houses?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Tom smirks. \u201cI travel a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t look so smug. I already told you that money isn\u2019t going to win me over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re starry eyed.\u201d Tom laughs at what must be a particularly grumpy expression, and then proceeds to take his coat off. Harry\u2019s eyes go wide and he jerks around in his seat, stubbornly glaring out of the window. The last thing he needs if he wants to avoid sleeping with Tom is actively watching the man undress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Tom just chuckles and strokes a sensitive spot behind Harry\u2019s ear and says, \u201cRelax. It\u2019s for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Harry can ask what he means, Tom swings the car door open and braves the weather. He rushes around to Harry\u2019s side and opens the door for him, holding the coat up like an umbrella to shelter under. Harry\u2019s heart flips with affection that he refuses to show.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cSuch a gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom stays by Harry\u2019s side until they\u2019re at the front door, and while Harry is still mostly dry, Tom is soaked. His shirt is practically see through - and if Harry\u2019s gaze lingers there a little longer than necessary, who can blame him? - but he doesn\u2019t seem bothered in the slightest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry says softly. He realises, then, how close they are, how he can feel Tom\u2019s warm breath on his cheek, feel the heat from his body. He takes a small step backwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inside of Tom\u2019s house is just as impressive as the exterior. The furnishings are all a deep, mahogany wood and actual, real life chandeliers hang from the ceiling, filling the room with a soft orange glow. Despite the overwhelming grandeur, Harry feels at home here, safe and comfortable. It certainly helps that Tom is hovering behind him, his hands squeezing Harry\u2019s shoulders in a calming massage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to get out of these clothes, just let me know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stumbles forward. <em> \u201cWhat?\u201d </em>He demands, red faced and flustered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s eyes widen, all faux innocence and exaggerated confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re soaking wet, Harry. I can dry your clothes off and have them back to you in half an hour. You can wear something of mine in the meantime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry says, feeling foolish and suspicious at once. They did say there wouldn\u2019t be any flirting, but Harry isn\u2019t naive enough to think that Tom will stick to that promise. His clothes are pretty gross, though. \u201cUm, yeah. That would be great, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom steers Harry towards a great, spiral staircase with a plush, green rug that runs the length of it. Harry kicks off his dirty shoes but Tom keeps moving, keeps pressing forward with his chest flush against Harry\u2019s back, and there\u2019s no time to set them aside anywhere. They lay abandoned halfway up the stairs, soggy and tattered. Harry feels embarrassed just looking at them amongst the beauty of Tom\u2019s home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom takes him to a smaller room at the end of the hall. It would be ominous if Harry didn\u2019t trust Tom - and maybe that\u2019s stupid, maybe he shouldn\u2019t, because he doesn\u2019t know anything about him other than that he\u2019s rich and he knows how to seduce somebody with only a few words. Those are definitely both qualities that a serial killer would possess. But\u2026 right now, ignoring the sickening display of money and power that surrounds them, Tom is just Tom, and Harry trusts him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, sit down,\u201d Tom says. The room is obviously his bedroom. It looks lived in, while the rest of the house lacks a human touch. There are photos on the walls, books scattered on the desk and the bed isn\u2019t made. A rush of warmth pools in Harry\u2019s stomach just looking at Tom\u2019s bed. Tom sleeps in that bed. He has probably slept <em> with </em>people in that bed, and now Harry is perched on the edge of it, pressing his knees together so that nothing embarrassing happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit smaller than me, but these should do.\u201d Tom gives him an obvious once over and Harry squirms, fighting the urge to fidget. Maybe he should sit on his hands for good measure, but Tom would probably laugh at him for that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hands over a pair of jogging bottoms and a sweater that\u2019s so soft Harry wants to bury his face in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you own anything that isn\u2019t a suit,\u201d Harry teases, hands already creeping towards the hem of his t-shirt. He should absolutely not start getting changed in front of Tom, but Harry is shivering and the sweater smells like Tom\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty bold for a guy that wears plastic bags on his feet,\u201d Tom says, and Harry snaps out of the daze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are <em> not </em>plastic bags!\u201d He says, indignant. \u201cThey\u2019re just\u2026 a little old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA little?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is very close to picking up a pillow and hurling it at Tom, but the man is already grinning and heading for the door. Maybe Harry\u2019s murderous thoughts were written across his face - he certainly feels exposed when he\u2019s around Tom, unable to hide anything he\u2019s thinking or feeling. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if Tom wasn\u2019t a complete mystery himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Tom says, leant against the doorframe. \u201cCome find me when you\u2019re done. If you get lost, just head down the stairs and it\u2019s the second door on the left.\u201d He clutches a different set of clothes to his chest and Harry realises that he\u2019s going to go and get changed now too. Fantastic - now that\u2019s going to be all he can think about while he\u2019s taking his clothes off in Tom\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods and Tom closes the door behind him. Although Harry misses his presence almost straight away, he can think clearly for the first time now. Something about Tom is helplessly distracting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He changes quickly. On his own, the room seems colder and emptier. A shiver passes down Harry\u2019s spine and he burrows into the sweater, inhaling deeply. Fuck, is Tom really expecting him to take this off in an hour\u2019s time? That\u2019s just cruel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes his wet clothes with him, because Tom never actually told him what to do and leaving them in a heap on the floor seems undignified. The house is ridiculously big with far too many corridors that twist and turn; without Tom\u2019s instructions, Harry would definitely get lost. As it is, he makes it to the kitchen relatively unscathed\u2013 Tom never has to know about the rug he tripped over on his way to the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom stands in the corner of the room with his back to Harry. He has changed into an identical pair of trousers and a tight fitting t-shirt. Harry\u2019s gaze lingers here, admiring the way he fills it out, the way the sleeves stretch across his biceps. Shit, this was definitely a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He clears his throat and shuffles his feet, feeling stupid when the tracksuit bottoms drag over the floor. He should roll them up, but that would attract even more attention to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Tom says with an easy smile. He looks so relaxed here that a knot of tension loosens in Harry\u2019s chest and he\u2019s drawn closer. \u201cI made you a hot chocolate, if you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry offers him a rare, genuine smile. The kitchen is bare, albeit sparkling clean, but the area around Tom is littered with cocoa powder and spilt milk. Harry wonders how often Tom is actually home - if this even is his home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any tinsel,\u201d Harry says. \u201cWhere are you keeping it all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom takes a sip of his own drink - coffee, Harry thinks, black - and his chest rumbles with a laugh. \u201cWould you believe me if I said I just haven\u2019t put it up yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot for a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s fingers stroke through his fringe to tame it into place. It\u2019s still damp and soft looking. Harry wishes he could reach out and touch instead, but he keeps his free hand stubbornly at his side and takes a big sip of hot chocolate. It doesn\u2019t even burn the roof of his mouth - how has Tom managed to get it so perfect?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave it away,\u201d Tom says eventually, and Harry frowns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it? Who wanted <em> that </em>much tinsel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom smiles again, but there is something sad about it this time, in the down turned corners of his mouth, the dullness in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a children\u2019s home, not so far from here. An orphanage. They don\u2019t have much funding for non essentials. I try to\u2026 help, where I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. He puts his mug down carefully on the table and scratches his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2013 uh, you help out?\u201d Harry prompts. He hopes he doesn\u2019t sound as surprised as he feels. Has Harry been treating Tom unfairly this whole time? He shouldn\u2019t let Sirius affect his judgement and he knows it, but he\u2019d seemed so genuine here, and Harry\u2019s first meetings with Tom didn\u2019t exactly shine a positive light on him. Guilt stirs in the pit of Harry\u2019s stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust during the holidays.\u201d Tom turns around. With his back to him, Harry can no longer see the way expressions flit across Tom\u2019s face, lightning fast. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t\u2013 they can\u2019t afford gifts, or decorations, or anything like that. It doesn\u2019t seem\u2026 right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry creeps closer, hand hovering over Tom\u2019s shoulder. He draws it back to his chest at the last moment, and says softly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s good\u2013 that you help, I mean. It\u2019s kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom scoffs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure <em> kind </em> is the right word for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time, Harry doesn\u2019t hesitate to touch. He places his hand over Tom\u2019s where it\u2019s curled around the edge of the counter. Tom sucks in a sharp breath but otherwise doesn\u2019t react.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re kind. You wouldn\u2019t help, if you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom laughs, brittle and harsh. \u201cIt was entirely selfish, I assure you. I was only doing what I would have wanted done, back when I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry had suspected, but he didn\u2019t want to say anything, and he didn\u2019t want to force Tom to say anything either. This isn\u2019t a confession, but it\u2019s probably as close to one as Tom can get. Harry\u2019s heart aches for him. He longs to press closer, to wrap his arms around Tom\u2019s waist and kiss the nape of Tom\u2019s neck, even if he has to stand on tiptoes to do it. The sudden urge is overwhelming and he has to bite the inside of his cheek until he tastes blood just to distract himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em> is </em> kindness,\u201d Harry tells him, quiet but insistent. \u201cIt\u2019s not selfish to help others when you gain nothing from it.\u201d Tom\u2019s back is stiff and, although Harry can\u2019t see his face, he\u2019s sure those handsome features are set into a frown. He decides to drop the subject for now, even though it\u2019s the closest Harry has come to <em> knowing </em>Tom since they first met.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you invite me to decorate this place, before? You asked for help putting that tinsel up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom half turns, lips pulled into a crooked, confused smile. \u201cYou said no,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you have done if I hadn\u2019t? Would you just have bought another shop out of their decorations to give away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Tom is smiling properly now, eyes bright again. \u201cYou think I\u2019d be unfaithful to your store? I\u2019d just have had to keep coming back until I had enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason, of course,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re so close, now that Tom is facing him. His pupils are blown wide and Harry\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t help himself anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s hair is soft and feathery at the nape of his neck. His cheek is warm against Harry\u2019s cupped palm. He tastes like coffee and Harry wonders what Tom tastes on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry has time to say, before Tom presses forward again and wraps his hands around Harry\u2019s waist, and then Harry can\u2019t even think. He\u2019s floating, eyes closed, Tom\u2019s hands on him the only grounding force. Tom forces a desperate whimper out of him and then Harry is being walked backwards, slowly but surely, until he hits the kitchen counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tom murmurs. A string of saliva connects their lips, and it would be gross if it wasn\u2019t so fucking hot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, get back here,\u201d Harry gasps, and Tom is there in seconds. His hands slide down Harry\u2019s sides slowly, over the curve of his hips and then under his thighs. Harry squeaks in surprise when Tom lifts him suddenly, arms wrapping around Tom\u2019s neck in a suffocating hold just to stay upright. Tom sits him on the counter and kisses him again, deeper now, filthy. Harry digs his fingers into Tom\u2019s shoulder with a groan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s hands land on Harry\u2019s knees and slip further, kneading the inside of his thighs. Harry\u2019s hips jump as spreads his legs and hooks an ankle around the back of Tom\u2019s knee, drawing him closer. He\u2019s hard in Tom\u2019s trousers, and that thought alone is enough to have him crying out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom breathes, eyes wild. \u201cCan I\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYes,\u201d </em>Harry nods manically. \u201cPlease. Anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now, he can\u2019t remember a single reason not to do this. He had thought this was a bad idea, hadn\u2019t he? Now, with Tom\u2019s mouth on his and Tom\u2019s hand rubbing his cock over his pants, he can\u2019t imagine why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom works one hand inside Harry\u2019s tracksuits and wraps around his cock, uses the other to pull Harry\u2019s head to the side. He bites Harry\u2019s neck sharp and sudden and then licks over the spot, works his way down to his collarbone with a trail of wet, open mouthed kisses. Harry whines and squirms in place, trying to move his hips, to fuck Tom\u2019s fist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d Tom says through gritted teeth. \u201cJust this once I\u2019ll let you get away with that, but after this I want to take my time with you. Spread you out and take you slowly. We\u2019re never going to rush through this again, understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The words barely make it past the fog of arousal that clouds Harry\u2019s mind, but he nods anyway, because it seems to be what Tom wants from him. Tom jerks Harry with tight, confident strokes. He makes no move to touch himself, even though the line of his own cock is clearly visible through his trousers. Harry sobs and buries his face in Tom\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom.\u201d He shudders. \u201cTom, I\u2019m gonna\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to come, darling?\u201d Tom presses a kiss to the top Harry\u2019s head, a surprisingly chaste gesture compared to the filth pouring out of his mouth. Harry jerks his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on then, Harry. Come all over yourself. It\u2019s alright, sweetheart, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s head falls back with a groan. Tom strokes him through his orgasm, keeps him upright with an arm wrapped around his waist. He must look utterly debauched: lips red and spit-slick, legs spread as far as his pants will let him, wine-stain bruises blooming all over his neck. He slumps against Tom\u2019s body, eyes slipping closed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Tom hisses. \u201cYou\u2019re filthy,\u201d and Harry only realises that he\u2019s jerking off until he forces his eyes open again and looks down. Seeing Tom with his belt hanging open and his trousers undone, fisting his dick as he holds Harry against his chest, might be a religious experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is just about to slither off the counter and kneel on the floor when Tom takes him by surprise. He grabs Harry\u2019s throat and in one quick motion, jerks him forward into a brutal kiss. It\u2019s nowhere near tight enough to do any harm or actually hurt him, but Harry\u2019s heart races anyway. Being tugged around like that is something Harry has never experienced before. Tom is probably strong enough to carry him around with one arm. Being at the receiving end of all that strength, all that power, feeling Tom\u2019s fingers twitch against his neck as he fights to restrain himself\u2026 Harry feels his cock twitch valiantly against his thigh. Tom is a fucking <em> beast, </em>and all this time he\u2019s been holding back for Harry\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This, Harry decides, was definitely a good idea. He should have done this sooner. He should have done this the first time they met. <em> Sorry Sirius, </em> he thinks, <em> but it turns out Tom Riddle isn\u2019t so bad after all. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Tom grunts, and Harry straightens up. He bats Tom\u2019s hand out of the way and strokes Tom from the base to the tip just as he starts to come. Tom\u2019s head drops forward and he bites Harry\u2019s shoulder to muffle a groan. Personally, Harry would love to hear him lose control, but he isn\u2019t complaining either way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gives Tom a moment to catch his breath. It seems rude to wipe his hands off on Tom\u2019s borrowed clothes, but there are no tissues in sight. Tom\u2019s hand is still wrapped loosely around Harry\u2019s throat and he must be able to feel Harry\u2019s pulse jump under his fingertips.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry prompts gently. Tom\u2019s chest heaves a few more times, and then he pulls away. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but Harry mourns the closeness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says, and hastens to tuck himself away and do up his belt again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Yeah.\u201d Harry\u2019s face feels heated. He pushes his glasses up his nose with his clean hand, even though they hadn\u2019t fallen down, and then waves his messy fingers at Tom. \u201cI should probably\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tom steps away completely. Harry is abruptly cold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry runs his hands under the tap for far too long. For some reason he is reluctant to turn around. Tom\u2019s gaze on him feels heavy but not suffocating, not oppressive. If anything it\u2019s comforting, like the weight of a blanket. <em> Harry </em> is the problem. He told himself he wouldn\u2019t do this, and now\u2013</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom murmurs. Harry\u2019s shoulders curl forward protectively and he dries his hands on his trousers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asks, chirpy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom says again. \u201cI want\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re interrupted by a sudden buzz that seems deafening in the otherwise awkward, tense silence. Harry\u2019s hand shoots out, reaching for the distraction with fumbling hands before he realises that this is not actually his phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cUh, sorry. It\u2019s for you. I mean, of course it\u2019s for you. It\u2019s your phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom takes the phone but doesn\u2019t answer it. It rings insistently in his curled fist but his eyes don\u2019t leave Harry\u2019s for a second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should answer that,\u201d Harry says, turning away. \u201cIt might be important. And then\u2026 and then, could you take me back, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With his back to him, Harry misses the way Tom\u2019s face falls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright if you can\u2019t,\u201d he continues, rambling obliviously. \u201cI can probably walk from here. Or maybe, if you could call me a taxi? I\u2019ll pay you back. I just\u2013 I should really be getting home now, I think. Thank you for the hot chocolate and the clothes, but I should go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picks up his abandoned mug of hot chocolate just for something to do with his hands, but when he brings it to his lips he finds it's gone cold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom repeats, and this time he is much closer, hovering just over Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stills. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go back. Stay here tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom got what he wanted. Harry slept with him - not all the way, sure, but close enough, and Tom is attractive enough to get anybody he wants in bed with him. He should be ushering Harry out the door by now, but he isn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants Harry to stay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The buzzing stops. Tom ignores the call.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Warmth blooms in Harry\u2019s chest. <em> Tom wants him to stay. </em>It\u2019s tempting. God, it shouldn\u2019t be so tempting but it is. Harry can imagine it perfectly - he and Tom could eat dinner together, could curl up on the sofa and watch a Christmas movie that Tom would complain about all the way through, could go to bed together\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Harry says in a strangled voice. If he stays tonight, he\u2019ll end up sleeping with Tom for real, and as much as he wants to, he wants to take things slow even more. There\u2019s still so much he doesn\u2019t know about Tom, so much he wants to find out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sue him, but Harry is a romantic at heart. He wants at least one proper date that doesn\u2019t involve Tom spending a ridiculous amount of money on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, he can\u2019t say any of this to Tom. It would be horribly embarrassing. So instead he shrugs, and turns around, and says, \u201cSirius will be home soon. No offence, but I kind of don\u2019t want him to see you drop me off, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s aiming for lighthearted, teasing, a <em> joke, </em>but Tom\u2019s features shutter as quickly as if Harry had screamed at him. He doesn\u2019t look amused or angry. He just looks blank.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course. My mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry shuffles and looks at the floor. \u201cI could take a taxi, if it\u2019s too much trouble. If you have somewhere to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Tom says briskly, and offers nothing else. He heads for the front door straight away, and Harry\u2019s stomach flips with worry. What changed so suddenly? One second Tom is asking him to stay the night, the next he can\u2019t wait to get rid of Harry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry says, grabbing his bundle of damp clothes and hurrying after him. \u201cWhat about your clothes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom stops so suddenly that Harry almost runs into the back of him. He pinches the bridge of his nose, as though Harry is just another irritating presence to be dealt with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep them,\u201d he says. Harry doesn\u2019t bother arguing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The car ride is tense and silent. He pulls over at the top of Harry\u2019s road and only hums in response when Harry says goodbye. The car dawdles against the pavement until Harry is at his door, nudging the snowman aside and ringing the bell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Sirius says. \u201cYou\u2019re late back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I\u2026 went to go see a friend. I didn\u2019t mean to stay so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d Sirius sounds hesitant and Harry freezes, paranoid that somehow Sirius knows. Maybe he saw the car, or maybe Tom said something at work. But then he smiles quizzically and says, \u201cDid you do something new to the garden?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s alone in his room that Harry slips a hand into the pocket of Tom\u2019s tracksuits and finds a phone number, hastily scribbled down onto a town piece of paper. He must have put it in there when he gave them to Harry, before the awkward end of their time together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry swallows past the lump in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In the end, it takes him two days to cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He saves Tom\u2019s number into his phone - safely retrieved along with his keys, without anyone needing to smash any windows - and then looks at it blankly for another ten minutes. He could be making a mistake here. He <em> thought </em> Tom wanted to spend more time with him, but Harry will never recover from the humiliation if he gets ghosted or sent to voicemail or just plain rejected. He should have known better than to get involved with Tom at all - men like that are dangerous in their indifference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Tom hadn\u2019t <em> seemed </em>indifferent, is the thing. That conversation in the kitchen had been the first hint of a past that Harry had seen. It can\u2019t have been a lie - Harry refuses to believe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Fuck it, </em>he thinks, and hits call.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom picks up on the third ring. Harry counts them out with a rising sense of dread that washes away as soon as he hears Tom\u2019s voice. The emotional whiplash leaves his brain scrambled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Tom prompts after a few seconds of silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t give this number out to many people,\u201d Tom says calmly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I don\u2019t have saved as a contact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry says, feeling stupid and dangerously special. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Nice? What is he saying? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen.\u201d He pushes forward. \u201cI was wondering if maybe you wanted to go shopping with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShopping?\u201d Tom sounds vaguely interested, which has to be a good sign.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Christmas shopping, I mean. I thought it might be fun to go together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying gifts for anybody,\u201d Tom says. \u201cBut I assume you\u2019ll have quite a selection of admirers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry laughs, because quite frankly that suggestion is ridiculous, and Tom<em> must </em>be joking. \u201cNope,\u201d he says. \u201cJust a few friends, and Sirius, of course. He\u2019s practically impossible to buy for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Static fizzes over the line. Tom says, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry taps his fingers against his thigh. \u201cI thought we could go for coffee afterwards, if you wanted? On me, this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, despite all of his earlier anxieties, Harry isn\u2019t expecting the blunt, unapologetic, \u201cNo,\u201d that Tom gives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. \u201cDo you not like coffee?\u201d He asks, voice wavering. \u201cWe could do something else, if you\u2019d rather. I went to this really cute cafe once with\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cNo,\u201d </em> Tom repeats sharply, and Harry snaps his mouth shut. He isn\u2019t going to ask again. He isn\u2019t going to embarrass himself by pursuing this. Tom got what he wanted from him and now he clearly has no further use for Harry. It\u2019s what Harry had suspected at the start, but he\u2019d allowed himself to be distracted, to be <em> wooed </em>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hangs up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be alright here on your own?\u201d Sirius asks for the third time. Harry mutes the television - he gave up on whatever cheesy Christmas movie this is half an hour ago - and rolls his eyes dramatically.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty, Sirius. I can handle one night unsupervised, believe it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius says shiftily. \u201cBut\u2026 Christmas Eve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s smile softens. \u201cIt\u2019s only a day,\u201d he says. \u201cBesides, you haven\u2019t seen Remus in weeks. Tell him he better have a souvenir for me, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus and Sirius have been together for a few years now, friends for years before that, and Harry has grown up with both of them acting as surrogate parents. He loves Remus, and he loves Sirius, and he loves that they\u2019re happy together. He just can\u2019t stand to see them be sappy and romantic in front of him when the sting of Tom\u2019s rejection is still so fresh in his mind. When they\u2019d asked if he wanted to go with them on what would undoubtedly be a date, where he would be an awkward third wheel at best and a hindrance at worst, he\u2019d declined gracefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A night in is exactly what he needs to get over this stupid, painful crush. Either that or a one night stand, according to Hermoine, but he\u2019s not sure what his options will be like on Christmas Eve. Nobody will compare to Tom, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you said hello,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cAnd that he\u2019s invited for lunch tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBonus points if he brings French wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius laughs under his breath, and then his expression melts into something softer and more fond. \u201cI love you, Harry,\u201d he says, and kisses Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you. Your parents would be proud too. If you change your mind, you know you can always call me. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry leans into the touch and sighs contentedly. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI love you too. Now go, have fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius hangs around for a few more minutes, checking his hair and his clothes for the hundredth time, before he disappears in a flurry of aftershave. The house is eerily quiet in his absence. Harry turns the volume on again and tries to lose himself in a carbon copy of the Christmas film he watched yesterday. It\u2019s <em> not </em>sad, he assures himself, that he\u2019s imagining Tom\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and wondering what disparaging remarks he would make.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t know how much time passes exactly. Time is counted in how many stupid festive films he gets through. He munches his way through an entire packet of biscuits and is contemplating whether to start on Sirius\u2019 mulled wine without him when a knock at the door startles him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several knocks, actually, over and over again, getting louder and angrier and more insistent with every passing second. Harry sits up so suddenly that he gives himself a head rush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em> okay,\u201d </em>he calls out. \u201cI\u2019m coming! Relax!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has no idea who to expect, but Tom is probably at the bottom of his list. He stumbles back, speechless, when the man himself bursts through Harry\u2019s doorway and marches through the house. His fists are clenched and his hair is messy. In comparison to his usual self, he\u2019s a mess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPack your things. I\u2019m getting you out of his house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is too astonished to answer. He watches Tom come to a stop in the middle of the living room and then look around, taking in the quaint furniture, the small television in the corner, the worrying number of stains on the carpet. He thinks of Tom\u2019s beautiful mansion and his cheeks burn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat?\u201d </em>He splutters. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius Black is cheating on you,\u201d he says, and Harry doesn\u2019t miss the way his eyes sparkle with glee. \u201cI saw him tonight with another man. I won\u2019t insult you with the details, but please, take my word for it. They were very romantically involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Harry still doesn\u2019t respond, Tom\u2019s face settles into something a little more appropriate for the situation. He rests a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and tilts his chin up with an intensity Harry has never known anyone else to have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 very sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand that this is difficult to hear. You can stay with me for as long as you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry says, inhales, shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not moving out. Sirius is my <em> godfather. </em>He\u2019s basically my uncle. Why the fuck did you think we were dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry expects Tom\u2019s face to be carefully blank again, but instead his eyes are wide and his mouth is hanging open a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2013 but you said\u2013 but he\u2026\u201d Tom\u2019s eyes go distant, cloudy with a dawning realisation. Harry watches with pursed lips. Eventually, Tom says, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d Harry pops the \u2018p\u2019. \u201cIs this why you acted so weird whenever I brought him up? Were you <em> jealous?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom grits his teeth. \u201cI thought you were choosing him,\u201d he says, frowning like the words were dragged out of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. So you thought I cheated on him? When we\u2026\u201d he coughs. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought perhaps\u2026 you thought it was a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Harry says, softer now, edging closer, something a little like hope creeping into his voice. Things are starting to make sense, in a stupid way. \u201cWhen I called you, afterwards, and you said no. Was that also because\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tom breathes, eyes snapping to Harry. He sinks down slowly onto the sofa, back ramrod straight, and curls his hands around his knees. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ve messed this up spectacularly, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite everything - the pain of these last few days, Tom\u2019s sense of entitlement, the fact that he seemed so delighted to have a reason to break Harry and his imagined-other-boyfriend up - a laugh bubbles out of Harry. He slumps down next to Tom, close enough for their knees to touch, and nudges their shoulders together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cTotal dumbass. I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom turns to him curiously. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d He says with the barest hint of a smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was back when I didn\u2019t know how much of an idiot you were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I think you\u2019re stubborn and petty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it means a lot,\u201d Harry says, laughing. This certainly isn\u2019t where he saw his night going, but he\u2019s not complaining.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom tilts his head, and Harry spots the way Tom\u2019s eyes flicker down to his lips. His tongue darts out instinctively and Tom\u2019s pupils widen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he starts. \u201cMisunderstandings aside, am I forgiven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2018s lips twitch. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em> sadistic, </em>you know that?\u201d Tom pokes at the sensitive spot under Harry\u2019s ribs until he giggles and squirms away. \u201cAre you really going to make me say it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you should say <em> something.\u201d </em>Harry juts his chin up. \u201cSince you\u2019ve been such an dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom brushes his lips over Harry\u2019s cheek, his jaw, the slope of his nose. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cLet me make it up to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s voice hitches when he says, \u201cHow?\u201d The wicked grin Tom sends his way suggests he heard it too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking coffee,\u201d he answers. \u201cIf the offer still stands, that is. You can get the drinks if you really want to, but there\u2019s an adorable little skating rink nearby that I absolutely must take you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re supposed to kiss someone when it gets to midnight on Christmas Eve.\u201d Harry loops an arm around Tom\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I think that\u2019s New Years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can do it then too,\u201d Harry says, and pulls Tom into a kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Tom just so happens to still be there when Sirius gets back, Harry decides, Sirius is not allowed to be mad. It is Christmas, after all.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
