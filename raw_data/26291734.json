  "text": "<p>The phone rang.</p>\n<p>It was so unexpected that it took Steve a good ten seconds to realise that it was <em> the </em>phone ringing. When he did though, he jumped up from the couch he was laying on and extracted the ancient device from his pocket, ignoring the noises of surprise from around him and answering the only number that he had saved.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d he breathed, hand almost shaking and the fear that had started clawing at his insides the longer it went without the Iron Man pilot appearing on the news finally dissipating.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Rogers </em>?\u201d came the answer and the blond paused. He knew that voice, but it wasn\u2019t Tony\u2019s voice. It was-</p>\n<p>\u201cFury?\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha and Clint both sat up straighter, the red head motioning for him to put it on speakerphone.</p>\n<p>Steve ignored her, the sense of dread returning with a vengeance. \u201cHow did you get this number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I was sent this phone and- I\u2019m assuming this phone wasn\u2019t meant for me then.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d\u00a0 agreed Steve, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI sent it\u2026 I sent it to Tony. How\u2026 how did you get it? Is Tony okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a pause, like the older spy was considering whether to tell him the truth and how much of the truth to share. \u201c<em> Put me on speaker, </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sent Stark a phone?\u201d hissed Wanda, glaring at him when he pulled the phone off his ear.</p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t answer her either, instead following Fury\u2019s instructions. \u201cYou\u2019re on speaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Good. Now: what the </em> <b> <em>hell </em> </b> <em> were you thinking?!\u201d </em> Fury didn\u2019t normally shout, but his voice was raised and thick with disappointment. Even Natasha blinked, surprised by the tone. \u201c <em> Seriously, because from what I can see it looks like you weren\u2019t!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve made eye contact with Sam, who was looking at him worried and stood straighter - even though Fury couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cThe Accords were -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I don\u2019t give a fuck about the Accords, Rogers!\u201d </em> snapped the Director, and Steve\u2019s mouth shut itself. \u201c <em> Bucharest and then Leipzig; are you aware of how much damages you have caused in two days alone?!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The blond frowned. \u201cDamages?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Yes, Rogers, damages! You see, when you attack a baseline human who was there to apprehend your little Winter Soldier with the same strength you use against aliens and robots, they tend to get </em> <b>hurt</b>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were going to kill Bucky!\u201d</p>\n<p>Fury continued like he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201c<em> And when you collapse a tunnel on a busy road filled with civilians, Rogers? People get hurt and people </em> <b> <em>die</em> </b> <em> . Seriously, what the hell were you and Wilson thinking? You threw a man out of his car and totalled it, and didn\u2019t even check that he didn\u2019t get ran over! Your buddy snatched a man off a motorcycle and threw him on the road! That son of a bitch is paralysed!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>That. That did make Steve pause for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because back then, during the fight, he had been on an adrenaline high, trying his best to make sure T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t get to Bucky.</p>\n<p>But now that he stopped and thought about it\u2026 fuck. Those people weren\u2019t German soldiers or Chitauri or robots or Romanian police officers; those were just civilians going home or going to work, people who had no idea what was going on, people just going on with their lives.</p>\n<p>Oh, god, he was going to be sick<em> . </em></p>\n<p>Sam seemed to have arrived at the same conclusion, if the expression on his face was anything to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And let\u2019s not get started in Leipzig, where, had Stark not cleared the place beforehand, you would have killed even more people! Do you have any idea of how much property you have destroyed? The Germans and Romanians want your head on a platter, and that\u2019s if the Nigerians don\u2019t manage to have you extradited first!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The soldier made eye contact with Wanda, and tried to keep his expression calm. The poor girl had already started to look distressed, red seeping through her fingers.\u00a0 \u201cWe were there to help people. If we hadn\u2019t been there, even more people would have died, we-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> That\u2019s not flying anymore, Rogers. </em>\u201d he said, voice deadly calm.</p>\n<p>It brought everyone in the room to stillness too. \u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fury sighed. \u201c<em> What the hell do you think happens when an American soldier clad in the US flag goes gallivanting\u00a0around the world and involves himself into fights that he wasn\u2019t asked to join, fights that end with dead and injured civilians and way too much destroyed property? What do you think happens when </em> <b> <em>117 fucking countries </em> </b> <em> full of said civilians ask you to be held accountable for your mistakes and you say a big fuck you before going off to Europe and causing even </em> <b> <em>more\u00a0</em> </b> <em> destruction? What do you think happens when the Avengers that do agree with the need for oversight end up being the ones who cause the least damages and, when faced with you, end up being the most hurt?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t answer, but he didn\u2019t need to<em> . \u201cWhat happens is that people start wondering about these \u2018superheroes\u2019, start wondering if the world was a better place before you showed up.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? The world needs the Avengers!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Maybe. But right now, the world doesn\u2019t </em> <b> <em>want </em> </b> <em> the Avengers. Or, at the very least, the world doesn\u2019t want </em> <b> <em>you</em> </b> <em> .\u201d </em></p>\n<p>It hurt. It hurt more than Steve would have thought, and he couldn\u2019t find the words to disprove Fury.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll need us again,\u201d said Natasha, speaking up and coming closer to the phone to be heard. \u201cRemember what Thor said? Earth is now on the radar; next time aliens show up, or next time something terrible happens again, the world will beg us to show up again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve wasn\u2019t one to <em> wish </em> for a war or a disaster to strike, but he couldn\u2019t lie\u2026 it was exactly what he thought too. Something would happen - perhaps even what Tony had said he saw behind the wormhole <em>(but you didn't believe him back then, you ignored</em> <em>him</em>)- something big enough that the world would need them again. After all, with Rhodey in a wheelchair and Tony MIA, only Vision and perhaps T\u2019Challa remained. And the little spider boy -</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Natasha?!\u201d </em>Fury\u2019s voice was shocked enough that Steve tuned back into the conversation.</p>\n<p>The red head blinked at the rest of the team and then smiled faintly. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Oh god, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d </em> said Fury, and\u2026 what? \u201c <em> Holy shit, you guys have really fucked up. I can\u2019t believe this. Years and years of trying to assemble a decent team just gone down the drain -\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being a little negative-\u201d started the spy, trying for some levity, but Fury did not seem to find anything funny about the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> No, I am not. Fuck, you shouldn\u2019t be there with them! You should be with Stark right now!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cShe understood that the Accords were dangerous and chose to join us instead. That doesn\u2019t mean she ruined anything,\u201d defended the soldier. He knew he had fucked up a little <em>(more than a</em> <em>little</em>), but still.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha gave him an odd look, like he had said something weird, but Fury was speaking again. \u201c<em> I don\u2019t care about her stance on the Accords! What I care about is that she\u2019s </em> <b> <em>not </em> </b> <em> with Stark right now.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBut why?\u201d asked Clint, speaking up for the first time. He - and Scott - had been very quiet lately, ever since the letter and phone he had sent his wife had been returned to him, burnt to a crisp the first and smashed beyond reason the second.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Because,\u201d </em> said Fury, thinly veiled rage and something like\u2026 fear?, in his voice. \u201c <em> If she isn\u2019t there with Stark, that means Potts and Rhodes are.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Natasha\u2019s face twisted, eyes widening and nostrils flaring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone else looked as confused as Steve felt - except maybe Clint, but Steve couldn\u2019t tell what the sniper could possibly be thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Rogers I knew you were naive, but surely you must see?\u201d </em> said Fury. \u201c <em> Why do you think I pushed you all to accept Stark\u2019s offer to live at the Tower? Why do you think Agent Hill asked you guys to try and convince Stark to stay on the team and then had to leave Stark Industries when you couldn\u2019t?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>When no one offered an answer, the spy continued. \u201c<em> Stark might have liked and supported you all these years, but it was not just because of your oh so charming personalities. Hill and Romanova, </em> \u201d Natasha flinched at the use of her surname, \u201c <em> worked very hard to safeguard the Avengers Initiative\u2019s relationship with Stark. It wasn\u2019t as easy as you think it was and you know why it wasn\u2019t?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cPotts and Rhodes despise the Avengers Initiative.\u201d answered Natasha, her face an empty mask.</p>\n<p>Steve blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>The red head gave him and the room at large a look of surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you were unaware?\u201d</p>\n<p>The supersoldier tried to think back to his relationship with Tony\u2019s friends, trying to find any hint of what Fury and Natasha were talking about.</p>\n<p>To be honest, he didn\u2019t really see them that often. He could count on one hand the number of times he had managed to see Pepper that wasn\u2019t one of those galas Tony insisted, at the very beginning, that they attend. She kept a careful distance from them, but she always greeted them when she saw them, even if she didn\u2019t stop and make conversation.</p>\n<p>And Rhodes? He had replaced Tony in their group as the heavy hitter, but, mostly because of the Winter Soldier missions, he hadn\u2019t joined them out in the field except for a handful of times. He never trained with them, either, because of his military career. But he followed rules well, even if the few times they were in missions together, he tended to stay with Vision.</p>\n<p>He blinked back at Natasha. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken much to either of them, but they don\u2019t seem to despise me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman sneered at them, but it was Fury who spoke. \u201c<em> You have no idea how many times Potts and Rhodes tried to get Tony to stop supporting the Avengers and making you gear? You are aware that the Avengers are one of the main reasons behind Potts\u2019 split with Stark?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>No, he wasn\u2019t. Steve found himself frowning: Pepper should be proud that her boyfriend was part of a team that routinely tried to save the world, she shouldn\u2019t leave Tony because of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodes didn\u2019t even want to join the Avengers to begin with,\u201d added Natasha, shrugging. \u201cHe only did it because he knew that it was the only way Tony would step down. Did you not notice how considerably colder toward us Tony was during the Accord meeting?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve had noticed that, but he had assumed it was because of Lagos and Wanda. Tony was, after all, a civilian - <em> and you smashed a shield against his chest - </em>and human losses affected him a lot more than they did the rest of them. Steve was a soldier, and he knew that in war you save as many as you can because you can\u2019t save everyone. Tony\u2026 Tony struggled with that concept.</p>\n<p>Natasha continued. \u201cThat was because of how little I could get to him when he was in full \u2018SI\u2019s Head of R&amp;D\u2019 mode. When he was too far for me to work my manipulation skills against him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve - and Scott and Sam - frowned at her, disliking her choice of words.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> After Afghanistan and after the whole palladium poisoning, there is one thing Rhodes and Potts hate and that\u2019s someone or something standing between them and Stark. And the Avengers? Not only did they stand between him and them, they caused a lot of fights and arguments between them and continuously risked Stark\u2019s life. They hate you as much as they hate SHIELD.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve, Scott and Sam stayed quiet, trying to wrap their heads around the words. They had genuinely never noticed this \u2018animosity\u2019 from Tony\u2019s friends before - well, Scott didn\u2019t even know Tony, so there\u2019s that - and it was\u2026 frightening. Wanda was glaring at the phone, but her hands weren\u2019t seeping red anymore, which meant she was calm enough, and Clint was looking up at the ceiling and frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And now? Now you\u2019ve all betrayed,\u201d </em> Steve flinched at the choice of words, \u201c <em> Stark, and Potts and Rhodes are not going to sit and take it. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha frowned at the phone. \u201cWhat does this mean for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fury laughed - an ugly laugh with no myrth in it. \u201c<em> It means that Potts or Rhodes are the ones who sent me this phone because they </em> <b> <em>wanted </em> </b> <em> me to contact you. They wanted me - and you - to know that they are with Stark, that they are the line of defence\u00a0between him and us.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cIt means that they just declared war. God have mercy on your souls.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>3 days later - 19 days since Siberia, 17 days since Steve freed his friends from the RAFT - Steve and his team were sat around the TV, watching with slight apprehension as Pepper and a dark haired woman walked across the stage.</p>\n<p>Scott, who had been particularly quiet since the call, perked up, a frown settling on his face. \u201cHope?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d asked Sam, glancing between the TV and the man.</p>\n<p>The other nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my girlfriend. You know, Hope Van Dyne. Of Pym Technologies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Pym Technologies and Stark Industries were enemies,\u201d asked the other. \u201cWhat is she doing with Pepper?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh! It\u2019s starting!\u201d hissed Natasha, glaring at them with irritation.</p>\n<p>Ever since the call, Natasha had grown positively frosty towards them. Steve had tried to reassure her that Fury was exaggerating and that everything would be all right again, but she had simply glared at him and walked out of the room.</p>\n<p>Clint too refused to interact with him at all, the righteous anger at Stark and the Accords that had fuelled him at the beginning evaporated. Nowadays he only interacted with Natasha. He had even stopped staying with Wanda, snapping at her more often than not.</p>\n<p>The poor girl was having such a hard time that sometimes Steve wondered if she would have been better if he had left her at the Compound with Vision. He didn\u2019t really understand the relationship between the two, but the girl missed him dearly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Tony Stark is well, </em> \u201d he heard and his attention was back on the woman on stage. Clad in a golden suit and red louboutins, Pepper Potts looked like she was wearing her very own Iron Man armour. \u201c <em> Currently he is resting after the medically induced coma he was under, but he is no longer critical.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cCritical?\u201d asked Sam, aloud, head turned to look at Steve. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t answer, just keeping his attention on the screen even as his hands clenched into fists.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> He would like to thank you all for the get well wishes in this difficult time, and will return and hold his own press conference once he is feeling better.\u201d </em> She stood up straighter, looking poised like a queen. \u201c <em> In regards to the events of Bucharest; despite Dr Stark not being involved in the actions of Steven Grant Rogers, Samuel Thomas Wilson, James Buchanan Barnes and Prince T\u2019Challa of Wakanda, the Maria Stark Foundation is ready to offer any help it can for the victims of the tunnel and the police officers injured when they were apprehending then alleged terrorist James Buchanan Barnes.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve had to bite his lip from reflexively declaring Bucky\u2019s innocence. At least Pepper had said alleged.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> We also offer the same effort to the victims of the chase between deceased HYDRA Agent Brock Rumlow, and Wanda Maximoff, Steven Grant Rogers, Natalia Alianovna Romanova and Samuel Thomas Wilson. Stark Industries and Dr Stark himself have offered to pay for the damages created by the now fugitives; however we were denied by the governments who want the fugitives to pay for their actions and be tried for them in a Court of Law.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>In a court of Law?</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d muttered Scott, putting a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to prison again, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d reassured Steve, sparing him a glance and putting a hand on his shoulder. Scott rudely shrugged it off.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> In the events of Leipzig, Stark Industries has already cleared and payed for the damages created by Iron Man and those sponsored by him: War Machine, the Vision and the individual by the name of Spider-Man. A comprehensive video of the fight, filmed by the Iron Man and War Machine suits - that will be made available for you at the end of this press conference - and an account from the Black Panther, show the Black Widow going against the Accords she signed, attacking the Black Panther and allowing fugitives Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes to escape, and therefore she will not be covered by Stark Industries regarding her - albeit negligible - damages. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha was standing perfectly still, eyes on the television.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Lastly, we would like to take this moment to offer our deepest condolences to the 9 dead and 15 injured victims of the Bucharest bridge; the 3 dead, and 8 injured members of the Romanian Police force; and the 11 dead and 42 injured civilians in Lagos.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>9 dead and 15 injured during their escape and collapsed bridge.</p>\n<p>3 dead and 8 injured police - who even if they were trying to kill Bucky, they had orders, and were simply following them.</p>\n<p>11 dead and 42 injured in Lagos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even Wanda was pale.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Good afternoon,\u201d </em> came another voice, and the girl, Scott\u2019s girlfriend, took the floor. \u201c <em> It is the first time in many years that Pym Technologies and Stark Industries come to stand together on a stage, and I wish that we were doing so under different circumstances. </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cI speak on behalf of both my father and I when I stand here and denounce the actions of Scott Lang, the pilot behind the Ant-Man suit.\u201d </em> Scott flinched, and even Steve was shaken by the thinly disguised <b>rage </b> in the woman\u2019s voice. \u201c <em> My father built the Ant-Man suit and allowed Scott Lang to use it because he believed in him; because he thought Scott would use it for good. </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cInstead, Scott Lang </em> <b> <em>stole </em> </b> <em> my father\u2019s suit and illegally entered Germany on a misguided crusade for Captain America, then entering a fight he had no knowledge of. I know this because Scott Lang, after a conversation that lasted less than a minute, a conversation in which he asked </em> <b> <em>no questions</em> </b> <em> , left me and his family behind to become a terrorist in the name of Captain America.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s your girlfriend? She seems to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the <em> fuck </em>up, Wilson,\u201d said Scott, teeth gritted.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> We have officially listed the Ant-Man suit as stolen, and Pym Technology - as Scott\u2019s Lang financial backers - is paying the millions of dollars in damages from the destruction he caused with the suit. On behalf of both my father and I, I\u2019d like to once more, formally apologies to Germany and the people affected by Scott Lang\u2019s behaviour. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI would also like to offer my support for the Accords.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>The journalists, who had mostly been quiet save a couple of outbursts, started shouting questions at this sudden admission.</p>\n<p>Scott was pale in the room with them. \u201cWhy? Why would she do that? You said that-\u201d He turned to Steve. \u201cYou said that the Accords were red tape and blame shifting? Hope is smart, smarter than me, why would she do this?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Maybe she isn\u2019t as smart as you think, </em> wanted to ask Steve, but he knew better. \u201cThey are. Maybe she hasn\u2019t read -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<b> <em>I </em> </b>haven\u2019t read them either, now that I think about it.\u201d Scott was looking at the room at large in suspicion. \u201cI took you at face value -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, she\u2019s talking again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I have read them, and bar a couple of points that Colonel Rhodes and Vision have assured me they also would be fighting against, the document seems sound. As the owner of technology very similar to the one used by Ant-Man, technology that I am very willing to use to help protect our world, it was important that I understood all and any law that surrounded the topic. </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cThe Sokovia Accords are not only </em> <b> <em>right </em> </b> <em> but also necessary, and both I, my father and Pym Technologies are 100% behind them.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>She then went on to offer the same condolences that Pepper had, but Steve wasn\u2019t listening anymore.</p>\n<p>The Accords were wrong, he knew that. And yet the people who had supported them were moving very freely around the world, and their support seemed to grow more. And while Steve wasn\u2019t stupid, Tony was smart. Especially when it came to politics and the public, he knew what he was doing.</p>\n<p>But then again, Thaddeus Ross was supporting the Accords. Sam had told him nightmare tales about the General, and while under SHIELD, he had read the things he had done to Bruce. And Tony, as Bruce\u2019s friend, should have known about them, so why would he support them?</p>\n<p>He had to be compromised in some way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re recruiting,\u201d suddenly said Natasha, breaking the silence. Her face was as blank as ever, but it was paler than usual.</p>\n<p>Sam frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember what Fury said? This is war. Potts just came on stage and basically said that Tony and Stark Industries have washed their hands of us.\u201d At their confused expressions, she sighed, annoyed. \u201c<em> Tony </em> is paying for the destruction caused by War Machine, Spider Man, Vision and him. Usually, he dresses it up for the media and says that \u2018the Avengers Initiative is paying\u2019, even though everyone knows it\u2019s him. But Pepper said Stark Industries and Maria Stark Foundation. The Romanian and Nigerian governments are looking at it as a \u2018us\u2019 vs \u2018them\u2019 situation, and that\u2019s Potts' play. They are throwing us to the wolves, and refusing to use the name \u2018Avengers\u2019 while doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve wasn\u2019t sure he understood what the red head was saying, but Clint and Sam did, if their worried expressions were anything to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they are making sure there is no reason for us to be called back in case of an emergency by recruiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRecruiting?\u201d asked Wanda, frowning slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cVan Dyne might just as well just said that she was joining the Avengers on Tony\u2019s side on that stage,\u201d told her the spy, standing up and shaking her head. \u201cAnd she just told every enhanced and superpowered person how she did it: by signing the Accords and approaching Vision and Rhodes.\u201d She turned to Steve and she almost looked like she blamed him for everything. \u201cYou gotta start praying that we are needed <em> soon </em>, because Rhodes didn\u2019t even wait a month to get started on a new Avengers\u2019 team. And we\u2019re on the wrong side of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>6 days later - 9 days after Fury, 26 days since Siberia, 24 days since Steve freed his friends from the RAFT - the computer Natasha had managed to borrow from King T\u2019Challa pinged.</p>\n<p>If Natasha\u2019s behaviour towards them had been frosty, the King had been a glacier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had thought that when he had offered Bucky sanctuary, to atone from his mistakes, it meant that the man had realised how dangerous the Accords were.</p>\n<p>That had <em> not </em>been the case.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man had looked particularly frustrated when Steve returned to Wakanda with a jet full of the rest of his teammates, sequestering them to one part of the Royal Palace and fully ignoring their presence ever since, while his team continued to work and amass signatures for the Accords.</p>\n<p>He had refused them most of the things they asked, only allowing two laptops between the whole team, and refusing to allow them to purchase anything for themselves. They couldn\u2019t even use the training grounds his guards used and their access to the rest of the city was very limited.</p>\n<p>In other words, it was another prison.</p>\n<p>A prison they couldn\u2019t escape because Steve couldn\u2019t - <b>wouldn\u2019t </b>- risk Bucky\u2019s safety, even if the King had promised that he would do as much as he could to help the frozen supersoldier.</p>\n<p>(and hadn\u2019t that been a punch in the gut, when, after everything he had done to help his best friend, Bucky had flat out told him that he had already caused too much problems by following him and asked to be put in cryo until his trigger words were successfully removed)</p>\n<p>So, he had stayed put and done his best to ruffle his teammate\u2019s feathers. Natasha had then had the idea of putting an alert on any of Tony\u2019s personal social media to be able to immediately know if the man said something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha claimed to have done it so that they could see what direction the wind was blowing in, but Steve was genuinely worried. Pepper\u2019s words had done nothing to calm him down. She said he was okay and was regaining his strength, but how hurt had he been? He had looked fine when Steve had left - <em> when he had left him behind </em> - but apparently he was hurt enough to be put in a coma?</p>\n<p>So, when the laptop pinged, Natasha stood up straighter, reaching out for the device as Clint, Sam and Steve assembled around her. Wanda scoffed at them and Scott hadn\u2019t really spoken to them ever since the press conference.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d was that worry in Clint\u2019s voice? Steve hoped it was; Clint and Tony had been close friends before the whole \u2018Civil War\u2019 as the media called it.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstagram live,\u201d explained Natasha, opening a tab.</p>\n<p>She clicked on Tony\u2019s icon - a picture of him winking at the camera with a huge grin on his face - and the image of the white walls of Tony\u2019s workshop appeared. Not that they had ever been to the Tower\u2019s workshop, but they had seen it from the outside often enough.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Have you turned it on </em>?\u201d asked a voice that Steve didn\u2019t recognise.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Of course I have,\u201d </em>answered -</p>\n<p>\u201cVision!\u201d immediately said Wanda, rushing towards them with wide eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Are you sure this is a good idea? </em>\u201d, that was indeed Vision talking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> He gave me access to his Instagram account and the letter. He doesn\u2019t care what I do. And I want to do this,\u201d </em> came the first voice again. It sounded distorted, to avoid it being recognised. \u201c <em> You ready?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Vision sighed. \u201c<em> I suppose. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Vision appeared on the screen settling down on one of the chairs, looking slightly awkward. \u201c<em> Hello, this is Vision,\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And this is Spider-Man,\u201d </em> came the second voice as the spandexed enhanced from the airport showed, sitting down next to Vision with a piece of paper, his voice altered. \u201c <em> Nice to see you!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why are you on Tony Stark\u2019s phone,</em> <em>you must be wondering.\u201d </em>He continued, sitting down more comfortably. \u201c<em>Well, neither me or Vision have our own accounts and when we asked him, he said it was all right.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<b> <em>You</em> </b> <em> asked him,\u201d </em> pointed out Vision, but his smile was soft. \u201c <em> I was dragged against my will.\u201d </em> He blinked at the screen a few times, and his smile got even softer. \u201c <em> I see a lot of questions about Tony\u2019s well being. He is\u2026 </em> \u201d he hesitated for a couple of moments, an hesitation that Steve was able to see only because they had spent a lot of time together. \u201c <em> recovering. His injuries were numerous, but after the very experimental treatment he has gone through, he seems to be improving. Dr Cho, Dr Wu and Dr Strange have all been consulting and they agree that he will be back on his feet very soon. Your get well wishes are noted and treasured.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The team - except for Wanda, who was staring at Vision with a lovesick expression - were staring at him, their eyes burning holes in his face, the question apparent even if Steve wasn\u2019t looking at them: \u2018<em> how hurt had Tony been after Siberia?\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>Spider-Man picked up the paper he was holding and shook it at the screen. \u201c<em> Back to Vision and me; after seeing this letter, we had considered for a long time what to do with it. Colonel Rhodes proposed that he burn it; Ms Potts wanted to eat it before Mr Stark could even see it. In the end I asked if I could do a dramatic reading of it and try to analyze it like I do- like we used to do in English class. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve was starting to get a bad feeling about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cThis is the letter that Steve Rogers sent to Mr Stark following their fight,\u201d </em>said Spider-Man, and Steve squeezed his eyes shut.</p>\n<p>He had sent the letter just days after the whole ordeal at the RAFT, and back then it hadn\u2019t seemed so wrong of him to send it. He had felt better after writing it, certain that Tony would be at the Compound reading it and would immediately call him and fix things with them. But now, after Fury and Potts and Van Dyne? After Natasha and T\u2019Challa?</p>\n<p>Now he wasn\u2019t so sure anymore.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man opened the scrunched up paper. \u201c\u2018<u> Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself\u2019 </u> <em> . </em> \u201d He read, making his voice gruffer through the modulation device probably installed in his suit. He turned at Vision. \u201c <em> Now, how exactly would Captain America even know that Mr Stark would be back at the Compound? Had it not been for you and Colonel Rhodes coming to check on the hole in the kitchen, </em> \u201d Wanda flinched, \u201c <em> no one would have even seen the package.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Vision nodded. \u201c<em> It is particularly curious. Before the events of earlier this month, Tony did not frequent this place all that often. The few people who wanted to see him were more than willing to make the trip from the Compound to the Tower where he resided.\u201d </em> That was a jab if Steve had ever heard one. Only Rhodes and Vision had, after all, gone to see him when he had stepped back from the team. \u201c <em> And the mansion? Tony rarely ever visits the one in New York. I don\u2019t understand why the Captain would even say that. Then again, he had never seemed to understand Tony that well.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>That was simply unfair. Steve and Tony understood each other well, they simply disagreed often (<em> right?) </em> . He had mentioned the mansion because\u2026 well, he knew about Tony and Pepper\u2019s break up, and Tony had always said that the Tower was Pepper\u2019s more than it was his. And he had moved them in the Compound to give more space for SI lab and offices. He had simply assumed that Tony had moved out of it too ( <em> he didn\u2019t ask. He never asked </em>).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018<u>We all need family</u>.\u2019\u201d Spider-Man snorted. \u201c <em> Mr Stark </em> <b> <em>has </em> </b> <em> a family. A family he would do anything for: Ms Potts, Colonel Rhodes and Happy Hogan. I wasn\u2019t even a superhero a year ago and even I know that those are Mr Stark\u2019s </em> <b> <em>people</em> </b> <em> . Not even his enemies are willing to go after them, because of how fiercely protective of them he is.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cAnd that\u2019s not counting his bots and his AIs. They are like children to him,\u201d </em>added Vision.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man\u2019s face was covered but it looked like he was smirking. \u201c<em> And you?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Something like his nephew or his grandkid, I\u2019m assuming, </em> \u201d answered Vision with a straight face. He shrugged. \u201c <em> I do, as I\u2019ve learnt from the internet, refer to him as father when I want something in particular, and he folds easy </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vision had never been quite so friendly with them. Steve had tried to pretend, but he had never been particularly comfortable with the android, because of his origin. Wanda had been the one who had opened her arms to him since the beginning, but if this was truly how he felt about Tony, then their relationship was doomed to fail from the start.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man snorted at his words, then continued reading. \u201c'<u>The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine</u>.\u2019 <em> See, this is utter bullshit. </em>\u201d he then said, and Steve frowned. Tony had always been the heart of the Avengers; without him, the Avengers fell apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said that?\u201d asked Sam, staring at him in confusion. Even Wanda had stopped gawking at the screen to frown at him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> \u2018The Avengers are yours\u2019? How can he even sit down and write this when, of the original team, two are missing and he got the other two while Mr Stark is alone? If they are \u2018more yours than mine\u2019, well, where are they? If this was a divorce, Mr Stark got the house but the good Captain got all the children.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t what Steve meant!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> It is quite obvious that the Avengers are more the Captain\u2019s than they are Mr Stark\u2019s,\u201d </em> agreed Vision. \u201c <em> Let\u2019s do a recap.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Sam Wilson.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Always follows the Captain\u2019s lead, no matter what. Joined the Avengers by stealing the Falcon wings - property of Stark Industries - and following him and the Black Widow in a fight during project Insight. The footage I\u2019ve reviewed showcases him as some sort of \u2018yes man\u2019.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sam clenched his jaw at the description, and Steve felt a pang of anger on behalf of his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Natasha Romanoff.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHer support of the Accords made me wonder if I had misjudged her. But at the end of the day, she was never fond of Tony as much as she was of Steve Rogers. She let them go because it would have been easier for her to fight against Tony than it would have been to fight against Rogers. So she\u2019s his too.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Natasha\u2019s face remained blank.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWanda Maximoff. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The android\u2019s expression changed into one of almost distaste. \u201c<em> She never liked Tony. He did everything he could to protect her after what happened in Lagos - since her visa was in danger of being revoked - by keeping her inside the Compound, but she thought herself too good for that. At one point I believed our attachment to each other meant that she could learn to at least tolerate him. But apparently she hates him enough to send me crashing down 15 floors.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Vis,\u201d whispered Wanda, tears in her eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> She hates him, so if the Captain stood against him, so would she.\u201d </em>summarised Spider-Man, and Steve really hated how their words made him and his team sound. He wanted to turn the video off since Tony clearly wasn\u2019t showing up, but he knew Natasha would hit him if he dared.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Colonel Rhodes.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> While he has never had a problem telling Tony \u2018no\u2019, Colonel Rhodes is firmly Tony\u2019s.\u201d </em> Said the android, and Steve felt even more uncomfortable than before. He had hoped that Vision would have lied, but the thing was\u2026 everything he said, no matter how rudely he had said it? It was true. \u201c <em> He spent three months searching for him while he was in Afghanistan. That\u2019s true dedication and friendship.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cClint Barton.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Clint stiffened slightly next to them when Vision didn\u2019t immediately answer, seemingly thinking about it deeply. \u201c<em> See, Mr Barton is a complex case. From the memories of my predecessor that I can access, Mr Barton and Tony were friends. When they all lived in the Tower, if he wasn\u2019t with Dr Banner, Tony was with Barton, usually. Sure, his first priority was Natasha, but I - and my predecessor - believed him a friend of Tony. He spent the most time on his gear, after all, molding it perfectly for him.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And yet, when the Captain called, he didn\u2019t think twice about it and followed him, readily fighting with Tony\u2019s weapons </em> <b> <em>against </em> </b> <em> him,\u201d </em>pointed out Spider-Man, and Clint pressed a hand on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhich is most curious, considering the man was retired,\u201d </em> agreed the droid. \u201c <em> I cannot help but ponder if perhaps he was simply itching for a fight after a year at home, and would have just as easily joined Tony\u2019s side. But then again, he clearly saw Romanoff on Tony\u2019s side and that didn\u2019t stop him. </em> \u201d He shook his head. \u201c <em> Fact remains that he is not here, now, is he? He joined Rogers in the fight, and from what the footage from the RAFT showed, still is with the Captain.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Clint soundlessly stood up, ignoring Steve and Sam calling him as he retreated to his room.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Vision.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I\u2019d like to say that, as someone who is part coding, I am driven by logic and thus follow logic and facts instead of personal feelings.\u201d </em> The android gave him a sardonic look. \u201c <em> However, we saw what happened when I found Tony after his fight with Rogers and Barnes. I am very clearly on Tony\u2019s team.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cSo,\u201d </em> concluded Spider-Man, sounding very unimpressed. \u201c <em> Of the 6 current Avengers, 4 were clearly on Steve Roger\u2019s side. So that whole \u2018they have always been more yours than mine\u2019 is utter bullshit.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>And, as much as he loathed to admit it, when presented with the facts, Steve couldn\u2019t argue against them. The \u2018team\u2019 was there with him in hiding instead of by Tony\u2019s side as he - he internally winced - healed. The Avengers were Steve\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201c<u>I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army,</u>\u201d continued Spider-Man, before making a baffled noise. \u201c <em> Now, what about James Barnes? You know, the guy Rogers caused an international and political disaster for? What of his good pal Wilson? What the hell is he talking about?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Vision shook his head. \u201c<em> It is most baffling. Does he not care for his supposed team? And even I, barely 1 years of age, am aware of the Howling Commandos and the friendship that they had. This is a whole rewriting of history.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone, Steve,\u201d added Wanda, giving him a compassionate smile.</p>\n<p>Steve tried to smile back, but Sam was frowning at the screen and side eyeing him vaguely. Natasha wasn\u2019t even moving.</p>\n<p>\u201c<u>My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either</u>.\u201d If the mask hadn\u2019t been there, Steve was sure Spider-Man would have been sporting his own version of Tony\u2019s razor sharp condescending smirk. \u201c <em> You heard it here first, folks. Captain Roger\u2019s faith is in the people.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Vision nodded, a very uncomfortable looking smile to look at on his face. <em> \u201cAh, of course. Which is exactly why Captain Rogers decided to go against </em> <b> <em>117 countries full of said people</em> </b> <em> in his crusade to protect Barnes. And also the reason why when those same people asked him to be held accountable for his actions he boldly proclaimed that \u2018the safest hands\u2019 were his own, bulldozed through them and when presented with the victims decided that \u2018sometimes we can\u2019t save everyone\u2019.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>When he said it like that it sounded way worse than how Steve had meant it. He simply meant that the governments -</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> But Vision, \u2018governments have agendas\u2019, don\u2019t you know!\u201d </em> The Captain froze, feeling even more uncomfortable at having the words he had just been thinking spoken out loud. \u201c <em> And 117 different countries will of course have the same agenda - making the Avengers their guard dogs. Nevermind that there are clauses </em> specifically <em> written up to avoid such a situation.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> It is quite amusing to watch a\u2026 someone as young as yourself be able to understand such a simple concept while our esteemed Captain failed to even entertain it as a prospect.\u201d </em> He let out a sigh. \u201c <em> Meanwhile he himself refused to admit that he had his own agenda: save James Barnes, no matter who or what stands before you. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve wanted to shake the other, to say that he was wrong (<em> but was he? He shoved aside civilians, police officers, fellow Avengers and Tony himself for Bucky. Who was next? Who else would he sacrifice for Bucky? </em>).</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> So no, his faith is not in the people. Next, \u2018 </em> <u>Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't</u>.\u2019 <em> I don\u2019t know what the hell is this supposed to be a metaphor for? Is he saying Tony and his friendship cannot be replaced? Isn\u2019t this supposed to be an apology letter?\u201d </em> At Vision\u2019s shrug, Spider-Man continued. \u201c<u>I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand</u>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d he muttered, while Natasha turned to look at him.</p>\n<p>Her expression, that had been calm and blank the whole time, turned almost shocked and angry. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d When Steve avoided her eyes, anger won out. \u201cSteve, you <b>promised </b> you\u2019d tell him! You told me not to cause <b>you </b>were going to!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Sam, eyeing them worried.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Now, </em> <b> <em>what the fuck</em> </b> <em> .\u201d </em> Steve nearly jumped as Spider-Man spoke again. \u201c\u2018 <em> I was really sparing myself?\u2019 \u2018Hopefully one day you can understand?\u2019?! Who even says something like this? After what he did-\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I don\u2019t believe Ms Potts has made the situation public knowledge yet,\u201d </em> stopped him Vision. \u201c <em> We should skip that part.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Spider-Man took a deep breath, and Steve was grateful for Vision\u2019s words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Fine. But saying \u2018Hope one day you can understand\u2019 is not a fucking apology. It\u2019s victim blaming and gaslighting one on one, </em> \u201d continued the young superhero, and Steve felt even more hurt when he saw Sam hesitantly nodding. Natasha\u2019s face was almost as blank as before, but there was anger in her face. Wanda was looking at Steve with something like confusion in her face. \u201c <em> It\u2019s like saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry you were hurt\u2019. You\u2019re not apologising\u00a0for the hurt you\u2019ve caused, you\u2019re blaming the other person for being hurt. But anyway, </em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018<u>I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do</u>.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> He never actually finished reading the Accords,\u201d </em> pointed out Vision, idly. \u201c <em> He read the abstract and like one page and decided that it was all red tape and blame shifting. Wilson and Maximoff didn\u2019t even attempt to read it. And Lang and Barton? I doubt they even know what the Accords are all about.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t need to read them in their entirety to understand them! He knew enough (<em> but did he really?)! </em></p>\n<p>Spider-Man snorted. \u201c<em> Interesting how the people who approved the Accords are the only ones with any form of actual education.

Colonel Rhodes, who graduated summa cumme laude in astrophysics - a literal rocket scientist. You, who basically know every law that has ever been drafted. And Ms Romanoff, a spy who makes it her business to know everything about everyone.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And on the other side we have Steve Rogers, who only barely finished high school, according to his records.\u201d\u00a0 </em> Steve clenched his teeth together.

Wanda Maximoff who has never made an effort to understand the laws of the US and who didn\u2019t even understand why leaving the sanctuary Tony had made for her here meant that she might lose her visa and any right to enter the US again.\u201d </em> Wanda blanched at his words, eyes wide and shocked. \u201c <em> Sam Wilson is an interesting one though. He is educated and he has worked in the military under a similar set of rules as the Accords, so he shouldn\u2019t have opposed them like that. But then again,\u201d </em> Vision shrugged, <em> \u201che never actually read them. Steve Rogers said jump and Wilson immediately asked how high.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Spider-Man snorted, while Sam looked down at his hand like he was ashamed of himself. Vision and Spider-Man were basically calling Steve dumb and everyone who followed him a stupid \u2018yes man\u2019. And they claimed to be heroes! They were acting like bullies.</p>\n<p><em> \u201c\u2018 </em> <u>I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do.</u>\u2019 <em> Which means, from the tone of this apology letter \u2018you\u2019re wrong and your belief is wrong, but do what you're gonna do\u2019. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Presumptuous as usual.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t what he meant! Steve just meant is as he said it. Not for the first time, he hated that he had been forced to go into hiding, unable to tell people his side of things. The media had been dragging his name through the mud ever since Potts\u2019 press conference, and now Spider-Man and Vision were misunderstanding his words and adding fuel to the fire. He knew that the people would soon understand that they were wrong, but having to wait had never been Steve\u2019s strong suit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018<u>That's all any of us should... So no matter what, I promise you, if you need us - if you need me - I'll be there</u>.\u2019\u201d finished Spider-Man, shaking his head. \u201c <em> Wow. I actually felt brain cells leaving my body after this\u2026 thing. This thing, because calling this an apology is absolute rubbish.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> He seems under the delusion that we will <strong>ever</strong> allow him within an inch of Tony after what happened,\u201d </em> said Vision. \u201c\u2018 <em> If you need me\u2019, well that\u2019s just not going to happen, is it? Not with the amount of Enhanced that have been slowly climbing out of their hiding posts following the formation of the Accords.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u2018<em> They are recruiting\u2019 </em>, had said Natasha. No, decided Steve, shaking his head. They were still needed, the Avengers were still needed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> The only place he\u2019ll be needed is - hopefully - a federal prison paying for his actions,\u201d </em> agreed Spider-Man. \u201c <em> I doubt even someone as forgiving as Mr Stark would be able to work with a woman who threw cars at him in a fight where he was clearly pulling his punches, or people who betrayed him.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cAgreed.\u201d </em> said Vision, grabbing the letter and scrunching it up in a ball. \u201c <em> DUM-E, catch!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve tuned out now that the letter had been read, staring as Vision and Spider-Man continued with their back and forth, talking about various countries that were after them and the people they had to answer to.</p>\n<p>The supersoldier was starting to grow nervous; there was still absolutely no trace of Tony, and the engineer had not once attempted to protect them or defend them from what his friends were saying.</p>\n<p>Natasha had checked the numbers: in the US, 59% of the people were on Tony\u2019s side, and while he hoped that the people would be on his after this livestream, he had the sinking feeling they wouldn\u2019t. And internationally it was even worse, with the EU having a 93% of people on Tony\u2019s side and Africa with a 74% in favour of the billionaire.</p>\n<p>Simply put, right now, Steve and his team were no one\u2019s favourites, and that was frightening. If Wakanda asked them to leave right now, they would struggle to find anywhere who would welcome them and offer them asylum of any kind.</p>\n<p>Wanda spoke a few minutes later. Steve hadn\u2019t even noticed that both Sam and Natasha were gone, leaving him alone with the Sokovian girl. Her eyes were wide and almost afraid as she looked up at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWill we ever go home, Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time since they had gotten to Wakanda, there were doubts in Steve\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>6 days later - 12 days since the press conference, 15 days since Fury, 26 days since Siberia, 24 days since Steve freed his friends from the RAFT - the videos from Siberia were released.</p>\n<p>When they had returned from Siberia, out of - <em> self preservation </em>- guilt and shame, Steve had refrained from telling exactly what happened to the rest of the team. Sam had pressed him for answers, wanting to know, if Tony had gone as a friend as he had promised, why Bucky had returned with only one arm and Steve didn\u2019t have his shield.</p>\n<p>Steve had told him a summary of the truth: Tony had gone as a friend but Zemo had managed to manipulate him, and it had come down to blows - <em> because you know that if you told the full truth they\u2019d hate you </em>.</p>\n<p>Natasha had looked at him in suspicion after that explanation, but Wanda, Clint, Scott and Sam had all started raving about how \u2018Stark couldn\u2019t be trusted\u2019 and how \u2018Stark had sold out\u2019 and all. It had made Steve uncomfortable - <em> because it wasn\u2019t fair, you\u2019re the one to blame, you </em> - because if everything went well, they\u2019d have to be a team again - <em> Tony will never trust you again </em>.</p>\n<p>The longer it went without Tony appearing on the screen, however, the quieter their shouts and calls for his head became. Even Wanda who still despised Tony had grown rather quiet, unable to call him a manipulator when even the media he was supposed to be manipulating couldn\u2019t find him anywhere.</p>\n<p>And after Spider-Man and Vision\u2019s live stream, Sam had started to look at him differently. He had yet to come outright and ask him anything, but he was clearly having his doubts about whether what Steve had told him, and the soldier had no idea what he could say.</p>\n<p>So, when that afternoon, twelve days after the press conference from hell and six days after the livestream, a picture of Tony - an old picture - appeared on the television, Steve was immediately leaning forward, turning the volume up, Sam, Natasha and Wanda also sitting up straight.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> ... anonymously last night at midnight, and the links were immediately sent to several news stations as well as posted on many different social media networks. Many tech analysts have confirmed the validity of both videos, and they shed a new light on the so called \u2018Civil War\u2019 conflict, as well as an explanation as to exactly </em> what <em> happened to Tony Stark.\u201d </em> Alarm bells were starting to ring in Steve\u2019s mind. \u201c <em> The following content is particularly gorey, so viewer\u2019s discretion is advised.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The anchor/host stopped talking, and two videos appeared on the screen; and Steve\u2019s blood froze as he saw himself, Tony and Bucky standing on the left video, staring at a screen depicting the video on the right.</p>\n<p><em> No, no, no </em>. They were filmed? Zemo-</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that\u2026 Siberia?\u201d questioned Sam, looking closer.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I know that road.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>How? Zemo was in custody, how had he had access -</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhat is this?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>The camera had a perfect view of all three of their faces. The Steve in Siberia eyed Tony, but stayed very still as they watched a car crashing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god? Someone filmed his parent\u2019s accident?\u201d asked Sam, and Steve wanted to jump in and turn off the television, but just like in Siberia - he was frozen to the spot.</p>\n<p>The motorbike stopping. Bucky in his Winter Soldier attire stepping out of it and approaching the car as Howard Stark climbed out of the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Help\u2026 my wife\u2026 help my wife. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam hissed. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Siberia Steve\u2019s eyes kept flickering between Tony and the video, and Wakanda Steve hated watching himself, hated seeing more fear of Tony\u2019s reaction than horror at watching the video. He was a soldier, but Howard? Howard had been his <b>friend</b>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The recognition in Howard\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Sargent Barnes? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>And the beating. The metal arm punching Howard\u2019s face repeatedly. Tony flinching away from the screen, eyes closing in pain. Tears in Bucky\u2019s eyes. Steve watching Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Why is he\u2026 stop,\u201d whispered Wanda, absolute horror in her eyes.</p>\n<p>And what did it say about him that the girl who had hated Tony for more than half of her life could show more empathy than he was doing in film?</p>\n<p>Maria Stark groaning on film, and Bucky realising she was alive. Approaching her and then choking her with his flesh hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why?\u201d whispered Wanda, her hand going to where the collar had been resting less than a month ago. \u201cSteve, why is your friend-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him,\u201d he pleaded, voice coming out shaky and\u2026 afraid. Afraid like he was in Siberia again, like he was watching his friendship crumble again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Bucky of the assassination video shooting the camera, and then Tony making a move at the ex Winter Soldier who jumped back, fear and pain in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Tony, Tony\u2026 </em>\u201d from a too calm Steve, a too cold Steve.</p>\n<p>Tony turning to look at him - because Siberia Steve and Now Wakanda Steve were the same, it was <b>him</b> - pain in his brown eyes and then\u2026 confusion.</p>\n<p>Steve could see it now, the quick question of \u2018why isn\u2019t he hurt?\u2019, \u2018why is he so calm\u2019. The realisation. The <b>betrayal</b>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Did you know</b> ?\u201d ask Tony and Sam at the same time. Tony\u2019s tone is <b>hurt</b> and <b>rage</b>. Sam\u2019s is fear.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I didn\u2019t know it was him-\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Don\u2019t </em> <b> <em>bullshit </em> </b> <em> me, Rogers. Did. You. </em> <b> <em>Know</em> </b> <em> .\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Why had he even tried to lie? Why hadn\u2019t he stood in front of the screen the moment he figured out what was going on? Why hadn\u2019t he just told Bucky to run and tried to keep Tony from going after him?</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Yes,\u201d </em> and it\u2019s too loud, the word is <b>too </b>much, and Tony is flinching away from Steve like he had just been slapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was a whisper, and Steve refused to turn around to see the same <em> disgust pain fear anger </em>in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the video wasn\u2019t over, of course the video wasn\u2019t over, and then Tony was punching Steve in the face, and Bucky was training his gun on Tony, and then they were fighting -</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d shouted Sam, unable to look away from the Steve on the screen to the Steve next to him. \u201cHe <b>just watched his parents die </b> why the <em> fuck </em>are you fighting him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha was looking at the screen, still like a picture, but her index finger was shaking slightly as the fight progressed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> It wasn\u2019t him, Tony! HYDRA had control of his mind!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Wanda was horrified. \u201cHe was the weapon, and he was in front of him.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201c </em> <b> <em>Move</em> </b> <em> .\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Sam turned to face the Steve in the room with him, like he couldn\u2019t quite believe what he was seeing. \u201cHow can you expect him to understand that after <b>you </b>lied to him and he had to watch\u2026 that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve hated the look in Sam\u2019s eyes. It was like Sam was watching someone he loved die in front of him. \u201cHe was going to kill Bucky. I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I had to save Bucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha didn\u2019t look at him, her finger still shaking even as she kept her tone of voice bored. \u201cIf he wanted him dead, all he had to do was activate the unibeam from his chest when he first had him pinned on the wall. Or use the lasers and cannons he has in his suit.\u201d She eyed him with mistrust hidden behind a blank canvas. \u201cYou saw him when he was killing against Ultron and the Chitauri. He went toe to toe with Thor and the Hulk. He has Veronica.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cDo you even remember them?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Steve refused to listen to Natasha\u2019s words - <em> because she was right, because he used deadly force and Tony was pulling his punches, and it took two of them fighting back to back to actually stop him </em>- shaking his head. \u201cHe was going to kill him. You didn\u2019t see his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I remember all of them. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He had to believe that, he had to hold onto that because if not\u2026 if not\u2026</p>\n<p>Natasha was implacable. \u201cHe wanted to hurt you as much as he was hurting. He wanted to make you bleed. But he was not trying to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> This isn\u2019t gonna change what happened!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I don\u2019t care. He killed </em> <b> <em>my mom</em> </b> <em> .\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The soldier turned his eyes on the TV again, hating how every trained part of him was telling him all the openings Tony had, while his mind replayed the fights they had against villains and gods and robots alike. He was attacking them the same way he had attacked the baseline humans in HYDRA.</p>\n<p>Maim not kill.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> He\u2019s my friend. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> So was I,\u201d </em> Tony\u2019s voice is <em> hurt angry tired </em>and Steve feels his heart break.</p>\n<p>Back then, he hadn\u2019t cared. Back then he was in a fight and Tony wasn\u2019t a friend, Tony wasn\u2019t an ally: Tony was an <b>obstacle</b>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vision\u2019s words from that livestream - <em> save James Barnes, no matter who or what stands before you </em>. Tony had stood between him and Bucky, and Steve\u2026 had turned on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I can do this all day. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve what the <b>fuck </b> is wrong with you?\u201d there was agony in Sam\u2019s voice, and it <em> hurt hurt hurt </em> that his own friend was disgusted by him, but what did he expect? Hadn\u2019t he known? Wasn\u2019t this exactly why he hadn\u2019t told them the full truth <strike>had lied, lied lied</strike>.</p>\n<p>And on the screen, the beatdown. Steve and Bucky against Tony, until Tony blasted his arm off and then.</p>\n<p>Then Siberia Steve sees red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Steve can\u2019t watch himself on the screen, attacking and hurting Tony, slamming his shield on his face, over and over and <b>over </b>again, and raising his arms again -</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Natasha, her composure failing her.</p>\n<p>because Natasha might have liked Steve <em> more, </em>but Natasha considered the Avengers her family, and Tony was her family too and Steve -</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s hand was on his neck and Steve wanted to scream that he didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t slam the shield on Tony\u2019s neck, he didn\u2019t kill him, he <b>stopped </b>himself, he hit the reactor -</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<em> That shield doesn\u2019t belong to you,\"\u00a0 </em> Tony\u2019s parting words as Steve started to leave. Steve stopping and turning around. \u201c <em> You don\u2019t </em> <b> <em>deserve </em> </b> <em> it. My father made that shield! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Erskine once said that good becomes great and bad becomes worse. In that moment, when his shield nearly decapitated the son of the man who made it, was Steve still good?</p>\n<p>Tony staring at their retreating figures, not moving from where he was.</p>\n<p>And then Tony lets out a choking sound, a cry. A ragged breath. More choked and painful sounds that tear at Steve\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>He faints.</p>\n<p>The video cuts off.</p>\n<p>He fainted. Why had he fainted? He was talking when -</p>\n<p>Sam turned the volume down and spoke over the anchors. If it was possible, his face looked even more appalled than before. \u201cSteve\u2026 you left him behind?\u201d</p>\n<p>The supersoldier squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cHe was okay when I left. He looked okay, he was talking, you heard-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smashed. A <b>vibranium </b> shield. Close range. Against a baseline human\u2019s chest. It left an indentation in his <b>armour</b> and disabled the arc reactor.\u201d Sam\u2019s words were like gunshots. \u201cAnd you thought he\u2019d be <em> okay </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has an artificial sternum,\u201d whispered Natasha, looking at Steve like he frightened her. \u201cBecause of the Arc Reactor. The Arc Reactor that Obadiah once snatched out of his chest. And you just\u2026 you.\u201d She covered her mouth with her hand and stood up, quickly leaving the room.</p>\n<p>Sam stood up too. \u201cYou lied to <strong>us</strong> just like you lied to Tony. You lied to <strong>everyone</strong>.\u201d He laughed, but it was a shocked laugh. \u201cVision was right. You only care about Bucky Barnes.\u201d His expression closed off and he was <b>angry</b> . \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking traitor, <em> Rogers </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>No, no, he wanted to say. He wanted to make them listen. To make them understand.</p>\n<p>Wanda\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t angry. She almost looked\u2026 happy. He knew she was just a child, but it was <em> sick </em>. \u201cSteve. You killed Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve turned to the television willing it to show Tony, willing it to show the billionaire <em> alive </em>and well.</p>\n<p>Instead a breaking news banner appeared.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Stark Industries confirms veracity of the Siberia Bunker Videos, and issues a warrant for the arrest of Steven Grant Rogers for obstruction of justice and the attempted murder of Anthony Edward Stark. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Clint punched him when he found out about the news, hard enough that he broke his fingers. Scott he hadn\u2019t seen since the whole thing with his girlfriend. Sam and Natasha stayed close to each other and had taken to leaving the room every time he tried to apologise to them.</p>\n<p>Only Wanda stayed loyally by his side, telling him she \u2018understood\u2019 what he did and \u2018even though watching your parents die\u2019 was something she wouldn\u2019t wish anyone, \u2018not even Tony Stark\u2019, he did what he had to do.</p>\n<p>Steve wished she had abandoned him too, hating her words.</p>\n<p>Things had, somehow, gotten even worse after the Siberia videos. For a few days the media spewed vitriol against Steve mostly, demonising every single media appearance he had ever made, the hashtags #TeamCrap, #ExVengers, #JusticeForTheStarks and #NotMyCap trending all over twitter.</p>\n<p>Then they started going after the rest of team, starting from Natasha.</p>\n<p>They theorised - correctly - that Steve and her had learned about the Stark\u2019s murders when they had dumped the SHIELD and HYDRA files online. So they went back to those files but, instead of focusing on HYDRA, many news agents and hackers decrypted anything about the Black Widow.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I doubt she even has a degree in psychology, </em> \u201d said a Dr Mandes, a copy of her report on Tony plastered on the screen. \u201c <em> Because if she did, then I\u2019d have to question her teacher as to how she achieved such thing when she claims that Tony Stark displays \u2018narcisistic\u2019 tendencies. Cause, frankly, that is not true.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> She claimed in one of her first interviews that she had joined SHIELD to do good in the world,\u201d </em> sneered another newscaster. \u201c <em> And yet, she went from murdering and torturing for the KBG and the Russians to\u2026 murdering and torturing for SHIELD. This is how she wanted to clear the red off her ledger? Of course SHIELD never noticed HYDRA was among them when their actions are exactly the same!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Then they went on Clint.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Isn\u2019t interesting how SHIELD covered up all the murders he committed while, allegedly, under \u2018mind control\u2019 and, instead of giving the man some help and a good shrink, they made him a goddamn Avenger?\u201d </em> asked a woman, shaking her head slightly, lips pursed. \u201c <em> No psych eval, no nothing? Are this our heroes? How come he does\u2019t get a report like Tony Stark did? Hawkeye yes, Clint Barton not recommended?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Scott wasn\u2019t known except for his brief stint in prison, so they mostly left him alone. Sam wasn\u2019t known either, but he was military.</p>\n<p>On the day his commander stepped into the limelight and announced that Sam had received a disonhorable discharge, the Falcon had nearly cried and then locked himself in his room for the whole night.</p>\n<p>Wanda though\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> This girl is a </em> <b> <em>monster,</em> </b> <em> \u201d </em> said an anchor, several reports from HYDRA all around her. <em> \u201cHer powers are downright terrifying. It says here that she was a HYDRA volunteer? A neo nazi woman in the same team as Captain America?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> It\u2019s insane. There are several videos of her using her powers to torture people. There are even \u2018training\u2019 videos in which she simply </em> <b> <em>watches </em> </b> <em> as the people she attacks scream and claw their eyes out and then she </em> <b> <em>smiles</em> </b> <em> . She is a degenerate. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> She has claimed in several psych evals done by HYDRA that Tony Stark is personally responsible for killing her parents because a shell with the word STARK was staring at her for two days while she and her brother waited to be saved. </em> \u201d The man speaking snorted. \u201c <em> Which is crazy for two reasons: how are you going to blame to bomb manufacturer\u00a0who did </em> <b> <em>not </em> </b> <em> sell the bomb to your government, you know, the government in the middle of a civil war?

Then it was a counterfeit. SI bombs were the best because they never failed.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve had to take Wanda out of the room after that so that she wouldn\u2019t break the television. Sam and Natasha had taken to avoiding her too after the videos of her training were released.</p>\n<p>When he walked back into the living room, a week after the Siberia videos\u2019 release, Natasha and Sam didn\u2019t immediately walk out, too absorbed by the television to notice him. Clint glared at him, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>Steve had never thought he would hate something as simple as a television so much, but as he realised James Rhodes was sitting there, he found himself wishing that damned thing didn\u2019t exist. Because, now <em> what </em>?</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> As General Ross has already proven, </em> \u201d was saying Rhodes, expression serious, \u201c <em> Sending baseline police officers to retrieve the Rogue Avengers would do no one any good. Steve Rogers has already proven he will go through anyone - friend or foe - to avoid capture.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve winced at the Colonel\u2019s words. It was the second time he had seen him since Germany - the first time being when Ross had been arrested and Rhodes had testified in Court against him - and it was clear from the way he spoke his name, the man loathed him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> So,\u201d </em> started T\u2019Challa, and only then did Steve notice the King was there too. \u201c <em> You wish to send the New Avengers to retrieve them? They haven\u2019t exactly been out in the field yet.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Rhodes looked at the King vaguely amused. \u201c<em> I am confident in my team, your Highness.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>It must be one of those Accords meetings that Steve had mostly avoided checking up on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A woman with a card with the Australian flag spoke. \u201c<em> Be it as it may, we don\u2019t know where the Rogue Avengers are at the moment. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodes\u2019 smile grew and Steve felt his insides freeze. \u201c<em> As of yesterday afternoon, I do, actually.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d said Steve, shocked.</p>\n<p>On the television, T\u2019Challa gave nothing away.</p>\n<p>The woman who had spoken blinked at him in surprise. \u201c<em> You\u2026 do?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s bluffing,\u201d said Clint, looking at the screen uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I have sort of known since Zemo was apprehended,\u201d </em> said Rhodes, colloquially. \u201c <em> But I didn\u2019t want to make accusations without having proof, and I didn\u2019t want to check for proof without having a team ready to go apprehend them. But now, I have both. </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> You see, your Excellency, while I might not be the inventor Tony Stark is, I am proficient in engineering; after all, I do most of my own repairs on the War Machine suit, while Tony does my upgrades and explains to me how they work. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Mr Rhodes-\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cI\u2019ll get to the point, yes. Do you recall what happened when Tony Stark shut down his weapon manufacturing?\u201d </em>he asked, politely.</p>\n<p>Another man with the french flag on his ID. \u201c<em> He recalled all of his weapons.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Yes,\u201d </em> agreed Rhodes. \u201c <em> And those he couldn\u2019t recall, he tracked down and destroyed.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Natasha stilled. \u201cOh fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam looked at her in confusion, while one of the chancellors gasped. \u201c<em> Oh. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodes seemed pleased. \u201c<em> I see you are starting to get it, Chancellor. I\u2019m no Tony, so it took me a little longer, but I managed it.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The french man was still confused. \u201c<em> I am sorry, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Chancellor, Tony Stark outfitted the Avengers </em> and <em>made their gear</em>.\u201d Explained Rhodes, and all the air seemed to leave the room. \u201c <em> So I tracked down the Stark weapons those morons used against </em> <b> <em>my</em> </b> <em> - against Tony, and,\u201d </em> he turned a projection on, a map appearing on it. \u201c <em> I would like to know, King T\u2019Challa. Do you and your people enjoy corporate espionage and theft of Stark Tech or are there some terrorist hiding in your Castle?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa had no words.</p>\n<p>Steve turned to his <strike>friends</strike> team. \u201cWe need to go, <b>now</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time in more than a week, his team rose to his call again.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+++</p>\n<p>Scott wasn\u2019t with them. Steve had searched everywhere for the man until Natasha had told him that he had left the same day his girlfriend had spoken against him and turned himself in.</p>\n<p>Bucky wasn\u2019t with them either. There were too many guards around the laboratory, and if they tried to wait for him to defrost, they would be caught - <em> because they were fleeing from the law now. They were criminals, fugitives </em> . Steve had tried to protest, but one look at Sam and Clint\u2019s faces - <em> daring him to put Barnes in front of everyone again, daring him to value Barnes more </em>- and he had to agree that for now, Bucky was safer in Wakanda; in fact, after T\u2019Challa had come clean, no one had asked about Bucky. Everyone was interested in them, the criminals, the fugitives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stealing the jet was not too hard, with Wanda using her powers to distract the Doras and Natasha and Clint figuring how to use it easily even without knowing the language.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d hissed Sam as they rose up in the air, hands covering his face. \u201cThis is so fucked, everything is just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d tried Steve, but the air force soldier immediately turned a glare on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, Steve? What could you possibly have to say now?\u201d he demanded, face contorted in anger. \u201cThe military will never want me back. The world fucking hate us. We left all of our weapons behind which means, <em> I\u2019m </em> <b>useless</b>. Everyone is out of our blood and there is nowhere in the world where we could hide. Hell, do you even have any money? All the money we used was Stark\u2019s, how do you expect to survive?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint put a hand through his hair. \u201cI can\u2019t go home to Laura without putting her in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt this point,\u201d added Sam after a few moments of silence, \u201cthe safest thing we can do is turn ourselves in and hope for mercy, because-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d Shouted Wanda, red seeping through her fingers. Sam took a step back, and Natasha put a hand on her gun - <em> where did she get that? </em> <b> <em>Why </em> </b> <em> did she have that? </em> \u201cI\u2019m not going back to any prison cell! I refuse!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, how do you expect to survive?\u201d asked her the red head, face impassive. \u201cAre you going to use your magic against civilians?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wanda stuck her chin out. \u201cWhat has the world done for me? I\u2019ve tried to help, to fix my mistakes and all they do is bring them up and fear me. I cannot control other people\u2019s fear only mi-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Guys</b>!\u201d shouted Clint, and all four turned to look at him. Clint\u2019s expression was frazzled. \u201cThe jet is going down. I can\u2019t fly it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Steve, coming closer to the man. \u201cI thought you said you figured it out.\u201d They had been in the air for about one hour, they were nowhere near safe!</p>\n<p>The archer glared at him. \u201cI have, but now someone - and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s Wakanda\u2019s tech people - have hacked it and are remotely controlling it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you un-hack it?\u201d questioned the blond, cringing at the twin looks of disbelief on the two agent\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <b>killed </b>the only person crazy and capable enough to hack Wakanda\u2019s tech, Captain,\u201d told him Natasha, voice angry. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him!\u201d He <em> didn\u2019t </em> , he <em> didn\u2019t - </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you blame Steve! Stark put us in the RAFT!\u201d She gave him a look full of adoration and Steve felt seriously sick. \u201cHe deserved it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint was on his feet in a second, eyes full of fury. \u201cListen here, you <b>witch</b>-\u201d</p>\n<p>And when was it that Clint went from hating and blaming Tony for the RAFT to him turning fully against Wanda? Was it before or after her HYDRA file was exposed? Before or after Siberia?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re landing,\u201d interrupted Sam, voice surprisingly calm all of a sudden. \u201cI don\u2019t what you\u2019re planning to do next, and don\u2019t tell me, so I have plausible deniability; but I\u2019m turning myself in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d tried Steve, and for once Sam wasn\u2019t angry when he looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI followed you, Steve, for three years. And it led me to this. I can blame you all I want, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I am to blame too. I should have asked more question, took off my \u2018Captain America is never wrong\u2019 glasses.\u201d He shrugged, like he wasn\u2019t breaking Steve\u2019s heart. \u201cThe glasses are coming off now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Said Clint, coming to stand next to him, making eye contact with Natasha. \u201cIf there is any way I can salvage anything, if there is any way I can make Laura forgive me and not file for divorce or full custody of the children, I\u2019ll do it. <b>Anything</b>.\u201d Anger as he turned to Steve. \u201cYou should have never called me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraitors!\u201d hissed Wanda, as the jet came to still, the doors opening the moment it stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome out with your hands in the air!\u201d came a voice from outside, and how had they gotten there so fast?</p>\n<p>Steve looked out from one of the window and felt like he was about to have a heart attack.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, when T\u2019Challa had offered sanctuary to Bucky - <em> and Bucky alone, not them </em> - he had said that if the world was going to come after them to \u2018 <em> let them come\u2019 </em>.</p>\n<p>They had come.</p>\n<p>Outside it was like watching an army.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a blonde woman in front, a spandex looking blue red suit with a huge star on it; a man levitating with complicated facial hair to rival Tony\u2019s; a civilian looking woman with dark hair and a leather jacket that sent alarm bells ringing in Steve\u2019s mind; a dark skinned man who sent the same bells the girl next to him was; and Sharon Carter.</p>\n<p>Sharon had a gun in her hand and it was trained to the door, an expression of barely concealed <b>fury </b>in her face. Her hand wasn\u2019t shaking.</p>\n<p>Why was she there? Was she there to help them? Cause her face said something completely different.</p>\n<p>Behind them there was a number of people in black suits, who looked familiar -</p>\n<p>SHIELD agents. But there was a different insignia on their body suits, a sword instead of a SHIELD. And none of them looked particularly friendly.</p>\n<p>The blonde woman took a step forward, hand glowing. \u201cWe have been authorised to use deadly force against you if you do not desist, so -\u201d</p>\n<p>Wanda shouted and rushed out of the door before anyone else could, hands glowing red and face contorted with rage.</p>\n<p>He <em> felt </em>it happen before it happened, and he rushed after the woman, trying to hold her back, trying to -</p>\n<p>\u201cWanda!\u201d he shouted, unable to catch her in time as several bullets fired, the glow of her hands fading before she even hit the floor, dead. \u201cOh my god, Wan-\u201d</p>\n<p>He took a step towards her and a bullet grazed his shoulder, Sharon having stepped forward with her gun trained on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMove and give me a reason to shoot you again, Rogers. I <b>dare </b>you.\u201d she spat, hatred rolling off her.</p>\n<p>Behind him he could feel the rest of team mates coming out, hands raised above their heads.</p>\n<p>\u201cSharon, what-\u201d he tried as two orange shackles materialised on his\u00a0 wrists.</p>\n<p>The blonde kept her gun trained on him as the black guy came to stand behind him and pushed him up on his feet, hand tightening against the bullet wound with no care. Sharon sneered at him. \u201cYou tried to <b>kill my cousin, </b> you nearly killed him with the shield Uncle Howard made him. Aunt Peggy would be <b>disgusted</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Getting shot again would have hurt less.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+++</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s trial was basically last, and with Wanda dead, there was no one else defending him. Clint and Natasha pushed everything they could on him, but Vision, Rhodes and T\u2019Challa all testified against them too.</p>\n<p>Clint managed to get house arrest but the last he had heard, Laura had filed for divorce anyway.</p>\n<p>Scott got house arrest too, since he turned himself in first, before the world ever figured out where he was.</p>\n<p>When Steve\u2019s turn came, he plead guilty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was nothing else he could do. He failed everything; no one told him anything about Bucky, his team hated him, Wanda trusted him to help her become better and now she was dead, his last link to Peggy despised him and Tony -</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter much deliberation,\u201d but they were gone for about 10 minutes only. \u201cIn the case of the defendant Steven Grant Rogers, the jury find the defendant guilty on all charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood up when he was asked, and turned to look behind him at the people crying tears of joy and cheering in the courtroom and his gut clenched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was his legacy.</p>\n<p>He saw Potts and Rhodes among the crowd, watching him from the back.</p>\n<p>They were smiling as he was dragged away.</p>\n<p>He never saw Tony again.</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Sometimes Steve thinks he killed him in Siberia.) </em>\n</p>"
