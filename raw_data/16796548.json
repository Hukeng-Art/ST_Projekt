  "notes": "<p>This is one of my \u201cFrom Samhain to the Solstice\u201d fics, and also the sequel to my Harry/Blaise fic, \"Vellum Voices,\u201d that I posted in July, as requested by many people. Make sure that you read \u201cVellum Voices\u201d first to understand the series. It will have four parts.</p>\n<p>This is the end of the story, although I'll probably write a sequel at some point.</p>",
  "text": "<p><b></b>\u201cThis is going to be easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry keeps silent, not that that\u2019s difficult when any words he speaks would only come out in Parseltongue anyway. But he doesn\u2019t agree. He can see at least three members of the Order of the Phoenix in King\u2019s Cross Station, and that\u2019s just by turning his head.</p>\n<p>Blaise seems to feel his tension in the set of his shoulders. He kisses Harry on the temple and murmurs, \u201cLeave this to me and my mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry holds up the note that he wrote earlier on the train, and which Blaise didn\u2019t deign to answer at the time. <em>How do you get to Italy? By Floo</em>?</p>\n<p>Blaise shakes his head, his eyes on the crowd of witches and wizards surging back and forth in front of them. \u201cBy Portkey. And there\u2019s\u2014yes, there\u2019s Mother now.\u201d His voice descends into a surge of pride and relief.</p>\n<p>Harry follows his gaze, and sees a tall woman in layered robes making her way through the station towards them. She has skin perhaps a shade or two darker than Blaise\u2019s, and maybe hair like his as well, but she wears a gauzy golden headscarf over it, so Harry can\u2019t see for sure. When she comes to stand in front of them, she bends down a little, and Harry can see enormous eyes considering him. He thinks maybe they\u2019re indigo, but it\u2019s hard to tell in the shadow of the train.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother,\u201d Blaise says. He reaches out, and she tilts her head to kiss him on the cheek. Blaise steps back and holds out his hand as if he\u2019s inviting someone to dance. \u201cHarry, this my mother, Hafsa Zabini. Mother, this is Harry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry writes <em>Hello </em>on his parchment and holds it out. Even though Blaise has told him more than once that his mother values Parseltongue, Harry still isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll react once she hears it.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini reaches out and clasps his hand. \u201cHello, Harry.\u201d Her English is soft and seems to have more than one accent. \u201cBlaise has written many letters to me about you. I am delighted to get to know you, and to know that you put my gift to Blaise to good use.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushes, knowing she\u2019s referring to the poison that killed Umbridge. He looks around, but no one is standing close enough to overhear their conversation. Blaise rolls his eyes at him and nudges Harry pointedly with his elbow. He thinks Harry worries too much about that, he\u2019s told him in the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am also glad that you are coming to stay with us. Perhaps I can help you with your curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles and nods. Even though part of him is grateful for the curse, because he doubts he would have got to know Blaise without it, it would be a bloody relief to speak English again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, come.\u201d Mrs. Zabini spends a moment shrinking their luggage into a tiny bundle that she tucks away somewhere in her layered robes. Then she extends one hand to Harry and one to Blaise. Harry takes her hand carefully. He can\u2019t ever remember a woman who was virtually a stranger to him wanting to touch him. Even Aunt Petunia doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry? Where are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s Ron. Mrs. Zabini turns around and looks down her nose for a moment. Ron jerks to a stop, flushing himself. \u201cI am going to take my son and Mr. Potter to Diagon Alley for a meal. What have you to say to that\u2014introduce me, Blaise, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Ron Weasley, Mother.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s one of my friends, </em>Harry wants to say, but Blaise squeezes his hand, and Harry decides that even writing it down might not be wise right now. From the way that Mrs. Zabini is holding herself, she can deal with Ron, and whether he might be spying for the Order of the Phoenix or not. Harry just sits there and watches and waits, and Ron clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to say that Harry is supposed to go back to his relatives\u2019 house. That\u2019s what Professor Dumbledore told us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I say that he shall come with my son and I for a good meal before he goes back to a Muggle nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron hesitates, but Harry only smiles at him and, of course, says nothing; Ron hasn\u2019t learned British Sign Language like Hermione, anyway, so they could only communicate if Harry wrote something down. Ron finally scratches the back of his neck and mutters, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Professor Dumbledore will have to say to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe may say many things,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says, and sweeps them away.</p>\n<p>They do go to Diagon Alley and up a little side-alley that Harry has never been in before. Mrs. Zabini draws a small four-sided crystal from her sleeve and turns to Harry. \u201cI can feel them coming after us. Do your friends always follow you so persistently, Mr. Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of them,\u201d Blaise says, while Harry nods. \u201cI think they\u2019re spying on him for Dumbledore, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini closes her eyes and sighs. \u201cWell, we will <em>not </em>permit them to get in our way. Take the crystal if you please, boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reaches out and lays his hand on it. Although it\u2019s big enough for Blaise to grip it, too, he puts his hand over Harry\u2019s instead. Harry studies him in wonder. Blaise smiles and starts to say something, but then the Portkey catches them up and sweeps them away.</p>\n<p>Harry does think he hears a voice cry out in dismay behind them, but he ignores it. He\u2019s going to spend the summer with people who want him around for once.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you trust me enough to have me look into your mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry locks his muscles before he can leap seven feet into the air. He\u2019s been in the Zabini villa for almost a week now, but it still makes him jump when Mrs. Zabini sneaks up on him. He turns around from looking out through a stone window into the gardens and finds her standing behind him.</p>\n<p>He was right when he thought he saw the color of her eyes in the train station. They are indigo, and Mrs. Zabini knows how to dress well and in robes that complement their color. She\u2019s been teaching Harry about fashion. For the first time in his life, Harry thinks it\u2019s interesting, and they have good, if mostly one-sided, conversations over the villa\u2019s breakfast table.</p>\n<p>But her eyes can also be too intense to meet. Harry finds his flitting aside, back to the trailing vines and shining flowers of the gardens.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do require an answer, please,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says, and for a moment she reminds him of McGonagall. Then she adds, \u201cBut you can wait longer if you want. I would never wish to injure the mind of a boy my son is so fond of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry relaxes a little. Mrs. Zabini and Blaise also never try to hurry him, and after years of being yelled at by what felt like everybody, this is more than nice. He takes a scrap of parchment out of his pocket and writes, <em>All right. Can we go outside while we do it? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI was about to suggest that, actually. A table in the gardens and chocolate.\u201d Mrs. Zabini extends her arm. Harry takes it awkwardly. He thought at first that he was supposed to support her or something, but half the time, she acts like <em>she </em>wants to support <em>him</em>. It\u2019s weird.</p>\n<p>They get out into the garden, and Mrs. Zabini indicates that Harry should sit at the little table they have there. Harry can\u2019t actually tell what it\u2019s made of, but it glows white and it\u2019s made of intricate curls, and the benches are blue and comfortable. He sits down, and Mrs. Zabini sits across from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeet my eyes, and do not be afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows and does it. If he can put up with Snape tearing his mind to pieces, then he can put up with a gentler touch.</p>\n<p>Her hand skims the top of his at the same moment as her Legilimency skims the top of his thoughts, and he feels her anger like a hissing cat, rather than a snake. Harry blinks and tries to let down any shields he had raised. He doesn\u2019t think he has any. Snape kept ranting at him about not having any, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not angry at you. I am angry at <em>that man </em>who calls himself a professor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry relaxes, and Mrs. Zabini gently travels through his mind, cool and bright. Sometimes he thinks he can catch the edge of a memory, but she always soothes it into softness again before he can hurt. She slips deeper and deeper, and then Harry hears a curse that seems to echo in his mind more than his ears.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini rises like someone surfacing from water, although it feels strange when the water is in your head. She reaches across the table and gently lays her hand over Harry\u2019s again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is a discussion we should have Blaise here for,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWill you let me call him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks and then nods. If he could speak in English, he would ask why she wanted to ask his permission. Blaise has been there from the beginning, and there\u2019s nothing Harry knows about the Parseltongue curse that Blaise doesn\u2019t also know.</p>\n<p>But if he could speak English, then he wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament at all.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini draws her wand and casts a spell that makes a chiming tone ring through the garden. Harry doesn\u2019t see how <em>that </em>is going to alert Blaise, but he comes running out in seconds through an arched doorway that leads into a walled colonnade, his face breathless. \u201cHarry? Mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSit down, Blaise. I want you here for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise sits down next to Harry, even though he has a choice of three other benches, and leans in until Harry can feel his warmth against his side. Harry breathes out slowly. He didn\u2019t realize how tense he was sitting here alone with Blaise\u2019s mother until just now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Parseltongue curse is indeed bound into your mind,\u201d Mrs. Zabini begins carefully. \u201cI had thought that perhaps the Dark Lord buried something else there, a secondary spell to anchor the curse. It would make sense for the curse to be so long-lasting then.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks at Harry, and her eyes are wide. Harry can see how shimmering a color they are now better than ever. \u201cIt turns out that he did not have to. You have a connection to him already, Harry. He tied the curse to that. Do you\u2014do you already suspect what the connection is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My scar</em>?\u201d Harry hisses. Neither Blaise nor his mother jump at the Parseltongue, but Harry feels stupid for forgetting. He reaches up and lets his fingers trace the edge of the scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot only a physical mark. I am so sorry, Harry.\u201d Mrs. Zabini draws her breath in as if she\u2019s going to float up into the air. \u201cHe made you into a Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise suddenly starts leaning on him almost hard enough to knock him over, and says loudly, \u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I don\u2019t know what that is,</em>\u201d Harry says, in stupid Parseltongue again. He looks around for parchment to write down his confusion, but Mrs. Zabini seems to guess it from the expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see that education in Hogwarts does not have the edge it needs to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother! I found plenty of books that told me what I needed to know.\u201d Blaise\u2019s voice is softer now, but the death grip he has on Harry\u2019s shoulder isn\u2019t reassuring.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are in Slytherin and knew many such things before you went to Hogwarts, and how to look for them if you found you needed something you did not know.\u201d Mrs. Zabini shakes her head, pushes her scarf lightly back into place, and leans across the table to study Harry. \u201cYou have not had such an education in Gryffindor, have you, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise has parchment sticking out of his robe pocket. Harry grabs it and the quill that\u2019s with it, and casts the enchantment he\u2019s got good at casting wordlessly, the one that fills the quill nib with ink. <em>Will someone please tell me what a Horcrux is? </em>he scribbles down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. All right. It is an object in which someone stores a piece of his soul\u2014a Dark wizard willing to pay prices that most of us are not. It will keep him immortal, and prevent his soul from fleeing. But that does not mean it is harmless.\u201d Mrs. Zabini\u2019s eyes are huge and tired in her calm face. \u201cI have never heard of a living being made into a Horcrux. Usually, they are objects that can be stored somewhere and kept safe. Do you have <em>any </em>idea of how this could have happened, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes. His world feels like it\u2019s imploding. All he can see is a diary bleeding black across the floor of the Chamber of Secrets, and a shade of Tom Riddle screaming at him in fury, and a basilisk fang that went into his arm and almost killed him, would have killed him if not for Fawkes.</p>\n<p>For the first time in his life, Harry feels that maybe it would have been better if he had died there in the Chamber.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s in shock, Mother,\u201d Blaise says anxiously from a great distance away, and Harry feels a Warming Charm cast on him. He\u2019s shivering. Why is he shivering? He\u2019s just thinking that it would have been better if he\u2019d died in the Chamber, that he\u2019s like the diary, that he\u2019s horrible and evil and going to possess people\u2014</p>\n<p>He leans over to the side and vomits.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to take care of you,\u201d says someone, but the voice is so distorted by the roaring in Harry\u2019s ears that he can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s Blaise or his mother. The firm hand on his shoulder is all Blaise, though, and so is the one that holds a cup full of something to his lips. Harry swallows obediently. Why not? All this is going to end soon anyway. He\u2019ll have to find a basilisk fang or something. How can he\u2014</p>\n<p>The room snaps back into focus. Harry gasps, aware of the fiery tingle in his throat. He swallows and looks around blankly at the garden. The flowers seem to swim in brighter colors than they should for a moment, and then calm down. Harry is leaning against Blaise, swathed in a heavy cloak.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did not know. Either what a Horcrux is or that you are one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head. The revelation is still overwhelming, but he can deal with it better now. He waits until his hand won\u2019t tremble, then writes down, <em>I destroyed a diary in second year that now I know was a Horcrux. How are we going to destroy me? </em></p>\n<p>Blaise hisses as if he\u2019s the one with the Parseltongue curse, and even though his mother is trying to say something, he is the one who lifts Harry\u2019s head and stares into his eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI will <em>never </em>allow something like that to happen. No, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m evil, </em>Harry writes helplessly. He\u2019s starting to shiver again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you. Never you. And if the Horcrux has any influence on you, then I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d Blaise\u2019s hands roam up and down his back, tracing the line of Harry\u2019s backbone beneath the cloak. \u201cDo you even <em>understand </em>how special you are to me? How I would fight for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I would do anything for the boy who makes my son so happy,\u201d Mrs. Zabini adds softly. \u201cNo. We will not be destroying you, Harry. We will remove the Horcrux, and you will go back to living the life you should have.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Does Dumbledore know? </em>is the next question Harry writes, the one that comes to him first for some reason.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini leans towards him. \u201cI cannot answer that for certain, but I can tell you one thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. Then he shivers. Blaise impatiently nudges a dark stone cup that Harry didn\u2019t notice before towards him. It has rubies along the side and smells strong enough that Harry hesitates to drink it, but Blaise only looks at him, and Harry smiles shakily and sips. He has no doubt that Blaise would just throw it down his throat like he did before if Harry refused.</p>\n<p>The liquid relaxes him. If it\u2019s a potion, it\u2019s the best-tasting one that Harry has ever had.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no way that a wizard and Legilimens as powerful as Dumbledore could have looked into your head and missed the anchor for the Parseltongue curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes. So if Dumbledore didn\u2019t know before, then he would have known the minute he first looked into Harry\u2019s mind after Voldemort cast the curse on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can destroy the anchor of the curse. That will involve removing the Horcrux. It\u2019s possible that I wouldn\u2019t know how to do that, since the Horcrux has rooted itself in your soul and magic, but that curse outlines the shape of it. I can separate it from you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>But what? </em>Harry mouths. Blaise tightens his arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will hurt,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says. \u201cIt will take longer than I originally thought. You will need to trust me more than you do now. It will take some potions and perhaps two months. But you have that time to spend with us, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks warily at her face, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be mocking him. And she doesn\u2019t seem to think that he\u2019s an abomination who should be killed.</p>\n<p>He nods. At least it\u2019s a decision he\u2019s making of his own free will. And he doesn\u2019t trust Mrs. Zabini enough to remove the Horcrux or the curse yet, but he trusts her more than a lot of people.</p>\n<p>Blaise leans more strongly against him, a silent presence. Willing to touch Harry like this, even when he knows that he\u2019s a Horcrux.</p>\n<p>Harry turns and sighs against Blaise\u2019s neck. There\u2019s one person he trusts more than any other. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not a powerful Legilimens. But at least he\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI expected you to have more of a reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks at Blaise. He\u2019s standing in the door of the bedroom he and his mum gave Harry, which is better than any other room Harry has had in his <em>life</em>. It\u2019s big and open and airy and has a desk and bookshelves and a table and a huge bed that Harry enjoys sleeping in. There\u2019s space for Hedwig\u2019s perch and all his schoolbooks and his robes with lots left over.</p>\n<p>In the dreams that he lets himself entertain each night just before he drifts off to sleep, Harry dreams about living here.</p>\n<p><em>To what? </em>Harry writes down, and holds up the parchment to Blaise. It\u2019s the back of one of the multiple essay draft attempts that he has to make with Snape\u2019s holiday homework assignment.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo learning you were a Horcrux. I mean, I understand that you wanted to fall apart for a minute there. But I didn\u2019t think even that potion would restore you as fast as it did.\u201d Blaise sits down on the bed next to him, staring at him without blinking.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What\u2019s in the potion? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of Mother\u2019s variants of Pepper-Up. Don\u2019t change the subject, please, Harry. You weren\u2019t as surprised as I thought you would be. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at his hands in silence, then sighs and rallies himself. <em>Okay, </em>he writes. <em>You won\u2019t like this, but it\u2019s the truth.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want, Harry.\u201d Blaise takes his left hand.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I think I never really expected to make it to adulthood. I almost died in first year, and second year, and third year, and fourth year. I didn\u2019t almost die last year, but only because you were there. And before that I grew up with relatives who hated me and didn\u2019t care if I lived or not. So it\u2019s not really a shock to know that I might have to die to get rid of the Horcrux.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Blaise makes a fierce sound and grabs onto him, holding him until Harry has no choice but to slump sideways and rest his head on Blaise\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI am going to make sure that never happens,\u201d Blaise whispers to him. \u201cI know that you might be resigned to this, but I\u2019m <em>not</em>. I\u2019m not going to let you die just when I found you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans more heavily on him, and waits until Blaise releases him to write, <em>It sounds like I can survive it, because your mother\u2019s here and you\u2019re here.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWould you have given up without us, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Answer </em>me, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t have given up, </em>Harry writes slowly. It\u2019s so hard to say the right thing, because he doesn\u2019t know if the right thing is the truth or what would make Blaise comfortable. <em>I would have fought for my life as hard as I could. But if Dumbledore or someone told me I had to die to save the world? I wouldn\u2019t really have been </em>surprised. He underlines the last word as hard as he can. <em>Upset, but not surprised. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever taught you the value of your life,\u201d Blaise whispers, his voice thick and grieved. \u201cEveryone tells you that you\u2019re the special one, the one who survived, but no one encouraged you to do more than that. To <em>live. </em>You\u2019re special to me for more than you surviving the Killing Curse, Harry. I\u2019m not going to let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He kisses Harry then, something he\u2019s only done lightly since they came to Italy. This strong one makes Harry\u2019s hands flail for a second, trying to find something to rest on, before they settle on Blaise\u2019s shoulders. Harry pulls Blaise to him and kisses back. He wants to hold onto him, to keep him here, to beg Blaise never to leave him alone\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>Well, I think I can count on that last one.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Then Blaise\u2019s tongue settles onto his, and Harry shudders and gives up on everything except the warmth invading his mouth. Blaise leans him back on the pillow and kisses him into gasps before he\u2019s satisfied. He pulls back enough then to give Harry a heavy glance, possessive like a hawk\u2019s talons. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes sting for a second, because he can\u2019t tell Blaise the same thing in English. He forces it back and writes on the parchment, <em>I love you too.</em></p>\n<p>Blaise smiles like he\u2019s just won the best prize in the world, and he bends over to kiss Harry again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you found out why he seemed so ready to yield his life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise tightens his hand on the edge of the table. He expected the question from Mother, honestly. He wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed the way Harry recovered from shock so easily and even from the suggestion that he might have to die to remove the Horcrux.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and looks up. Mother sits across from him, her own teacup balanced on the edge of her hand and her gaze calm. That helps to relax Blaise, too. \u201cHe never expected to make it to adulthood. He thought one of the threats along the way would destroy him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd therefore the Horcrux only seemed like another threat. How many times has he nearly died, Blaise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCounting the time when he was a baby, at least five.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother stands up and walks out to stare out the French doors into the garden. Blaise watches her. He loves her, but theirs is a complex relationship, because her magic and her wisdom together mean that she protects him constantly and Blaise can\u2019t give any of that protection back. But then he found Harry, and he found someone who needed that kind of love from him. It\u2019s wonderful, even if Blaise longs for the day that Harry can speak English again and he won\u2019t need to protect him as much.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you choose someone in so much danger, Blaise?\u201d Mother asks without turning around.</p>\n<p>Blaise has been prepared for this question. \u201cBecause his ability to speak being removed made me see the real Harry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother glances at him over her shoulder. \u201cFew people would say that. Most people would assume that the soul of a person is expressed through their words.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but in Hogwarts, some of those words are \u2018Gryffindor\u2019 and \u2018Slytherin\u2019 with all the baggage attached. Mother\u2026he was so alone. His friends stood by him, of course, but they couldn\u2019t communicate with him except in writing, either. Almost everyone else withdrew from him, either because of the Parseltongue or because they believed those lies about Voldemort not being back. And even I hesitated for a long time, because I couldn\u2019t believe that no one else saw what I saw. I kept thinking that someone else would move in and claim him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a possession, Blaise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles a little. Mother will fence with him and demand that he test and prove his love. It\u2019s not only because she wants to make sure that Harry is his permanent choice, and a worthy one. It\u2019s also because she doesn\u2019t want Blaise to make some of her own mistakes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn ally, I thought at the time. A source of strength. Do you have any idea how strong he is, Mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am beginning to understand, since my journey into his mind yesterday. He bears the pain of malicious Legilimency without crying out.\u201d For a moment, Mother\u2019s fingers twitch. \u201cThe man who <em>taught </em>him before this had no care at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise nods. He has other scores to settle, but the one with Snape isn\u2019t the smallest one. \u201cHarry lasted through not being able to <em>speak </em>to anyone, through almost everyone being afraid of him, through those Legilimency lessons\u2014even though I didn\u2019t know about them\u2014and through being tortured by Professor Umbridge. I wanted to be close to that strength, Mother. Just an ally, I thought at first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I saw how much greater his strength was than I thought, and that he wasn\u2019t going to push me away\u2014he needs my protection right now, but he won\u2019t always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mother says after a moment. \u201cI can see now why you became enamored of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise isn\u2019t offended. Mother will probably refer to it as being enamored until he or Harry makes some grand gesture to prove their love. And Blaise can live with that. He would much rather Mother look out for him and be overprotective than not protective at all.</p>\n<p>He would much rather have extra confirmation that Harry is his. Harry\u2019s said it, Blaise has felt it, but he\u2019s greedy. He wants even more.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThis first session is going to be painful. I will pull the Horcrux closer to the surface of your mind for examination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods and stares at the table that he and Mrs. Zabini are sitting at in the garden. Blaise clutches his hand from the left. Harry manages to smile at him, but God, it\u2019s an effort. He\u2019s almost got used to <em>not </em>being in pain, other than the constant annoyance that he can\u2019t speak English. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have potions that will soothe the pain,\u201d Mrs. Zabini continues, and gestures at a row of vials sitting next to her. \u201cYou need not fear.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least that\u2019s more than he would ever get from the Dursleys or Snape. Harry meets Mrs. Zabini\u2019s eyes and holds as still as he can while she slips into his mind and glides through it.</p>\n<p>He gasps when she pulls back. For a moment, he wonders if she hasn\u2019t found what she\u2019s looking for. There\u2019s a faint red mist hovering between them, but none of the pain that she told him\u2014</p>\n<p>Then agony slams him into the table. Harry grits his teeth and doesn\u2019t voice it. He\u2019s stronger than that. And he clutches Blaise\u2019s hand, but concentrates on not breaking it. That gives him something to think about other than the driving anguish that\u2019s making his ears pop and the bones in his hands shiver.</p>\n<p>Someone says something. The words seem to float outside his awareness and drift into the air. Harry tries to lift his head. There\u2019s no way. There\u2019s no warmth. Why is he on cold stone? Why does he seem to have skin instead of scales? He should be away from here, he should be at the side of the one who made him\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, that he understood. Harry opens his mouth to gasp, and someone pours a potion into it. Harry gulps it greedily, and then leans to the side. Blaise\u2019s shoulder is there to support his head, and his arm there to hold Harry upright. Harry shudders and tries to ignore the memory of what it was like to be a snake loyal to Voldemort.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d Blaise says, in what\u2019s almost a demand, and he traces the line of Harry\u2019s scar for a second.</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201c<em>I\u2019m all right</em>,\u201d he hisses in Parseltongue before he remembers. But he writes it down on the parchment they have waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was an unexpected result.\u201d Mrs. Zabini watches him with a faint frown, reaching up to adjust her head scarf. It\u2019s moved a little, and she has lines of sweat on her face, but that\u2019s the only sign Harry can see that she had trouble when she went to help him. \u201cHmmm. I am very much afraid that this will take longer than I thought, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows. He thinks he knows what that means, but he\u2019s not going to say it. He can\u2019t, anyway.</p>\n<p>He reckoned without Blaise, who\u2019s more perceptive than Harry gave him credit for. He catches Harry\u2019s hand in his and leans over. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks, quietly, intently. \u201cI want to know what you would have said if you could speak English, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head. Across the table, Mrs. Zabini is watching him with concern, but Harry is familiar with concern. It\u2019s the thing that Professor McGonagall showed him before telling him that she couldn\u2019t stop people from bullying him because he spoke Parseltongue all the time. It\u2019s the kind of concern that his primary school teachers showed him before they said that they couldn\u2019t do anything about the Dursleys. <em>Nothing</em>, he writes brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>What <em>isn\u2019t </em>familiar is the way Blaise leans against him, his hand around Harry\u2019s wrist, his eyes steady and holding their own brand of concern. Shutting his eyes and breathing a little won\u2019t make this go away. And the more Harry swallows, the closer he just comes to fucking <em>tears</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>And now Mrs. Zabini is in on the act, and it really sounds as though this might be a different kind of concern than he\u2019s familiar with. Harry swallows hope and writes, <em>I know that you\u2019re going to say you can\u2019t do it. That it would take too long and you want to do other things. So\u2014that\u2019s all right. You\u2019ve already given me more than anyone else has.</em></p>\n<p>Blaise twists his head to read the writing, since Harry turned it around to face Mrs. Zabini right after he wrote it, and then faces Harry. His expression has gone blank and cool. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the way that he has been treated all his life? Is it a marvel that he should think it, Blaise?\u201d Mrs. Zabini sighs a little, and reaches up to cast a Cooling Charm on her face that dries the sweat. \u201cIn a way, it might even be comforting to return to what he knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s <em>not going to</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at Blaise, because that dark weight in his voice isn\u2019t familiar, either. Then he stares at his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you <em>want </em>us to go away and leave you alone?\u201d Blaise continues, insistent. His fingers are wrapping Harry\u2019s wrist, completely surrounding the bone. Harry can barely see it when he looks at Blaise\u2019s hand. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t expect it,\u201d Blaise says. \u201cMy mother\u2019s right that it\u2019ll probably take a long time to unhook the curse from the Horcrux and get you speaking English again. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to <em>give up</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise says the last few words like it\u2019s a curse. Harry breathes out slowly. Then he writes, <em>I\u2019m sorry</em>.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini replies this time. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry for doubting us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you still don\u2019t fully trust us? You won\u2019t believe that we\u2019ll stay with you until it happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaces. He can get away with lying to people most of the time, or just keeping silence. That\u2019s been easier than ever, this past year. Why can\u2019t he do it now? It\u2019s like only being able to speak Parseltongue makes him <em>easier </em>to understand for Blaise and his mother, which makes absolutely zero sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that only proof will make the difference,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says calmly. \u201cSo. We\u2019ll keep on. And we\u2019ll investigate exactly how deeply the Horcrux is intertwined with your soul. I think that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know of any other cases of living Horcruxes right now, and of course with ordinary ones it doesn\u2019t matter how long the shard of soul has been in there, because there\u2019s no other soul to interact with. But we are going to solve this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never known my mother to lie, even by accident,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cWhat she promises, she keeps. We\u2019re going to solve this, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Harry lets himself believe enough to hold onto Blaise\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When they aren\u2019t working on the Horcrux, they\u2019re exploring Florence.</p>\n<p>Harry appreciates that Blaise and his mother don\u2019t take him to the big wizarding section, where there are people who might recognize him no matter how unexpected it would be to see Harry Potter in Italy. Instead, they explore sections of Muggle shops, including a place where Harry tastes gelato for the first time in his life, and they sit on benches and watch flights of doves cross the sky. Harry listens to the Italian around him, and even though he doesn\u2019t understand much, he\u2019s already more relaxed than he would be in Britain.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s just because he knows that he couldn\u2019t join in the speaking here anyway, whereas at home he always felt shut out from others speaking English, but Harry doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019ll take it.</p>\n<p>There is one small wizarding community an Apparition away from Florence\u2014Mrs. Zabini says it\u2019s near Venice\u2014that they do go to, because Mrs. Zabini is flatly insistent about Harry needing new robes. Harry is overwhelmed when they step into the first shop and he sees an explosion of colors. He actually thinks for a second that they\u2019re in a flower shop instead.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I don\u2019t need this much</em>!\u201d he hisses at Blaise, forgetting again, but Blaise only laughs without needing to know the exact words and grabs his hands to drag him further back towards shelves with more robes folded on them, between rows of hanging ones. Harry touches a silken one and snatches his hand back. It really is like touching the petals of a giant orchid.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the right to touch whatever you want,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says, coming up behind him. \u201cThis is your heritage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry says nothing, because of course he can\u2019t, but he\u2019s thinking that his kind of heritage probably never included robes like this. His father\u2019s robes in the photographs he\u2019s seen are nice enough, but nothing like <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>Blaise studies him for a second, then glances at his mother and asks, \u201cDo you not want to spend the money, Harry, or are you just not used to this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods twice. \u201cBoth, then,\u201d Blaise says. \u201cListen, Harry. My mother is paying for everything today, the same way that she Apparated us here. In <em>normal </em>wizarding households, parents take care of you until you reach the age of seventeen. I understand why your parents couldn\u2019t.\u201d His voice softens, and he turns Harry around. \u201cDo you really want to have a fight about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head, staring at his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really not want the robes? Do you not like them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Harry hisses. He thought they would probably walk into a shop full of robes like the stupid dress ones that he had to wear to the Yule Ball, but these robes have a lot more colors and cuts and styles, and they look cooler and lighter, too.</p>\n<p>Blaise has learned to recognize that particular Parseltongue word. \u201cThen let my mother pay for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks miserably at Mrs. Zabini. She only smiles at him and winds her headscarf a little tighter around her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure, Harry. I\u2019ve only had one child to spoil for so many years, and Blaise is hard to spoil. Let me buy your robes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slowly nods. In a way, it feels good, like someone is finally willing to look out for him, and he actually <em>wants </em>to let Mrs. Zabini do that.</p>\n<p>But it also feels as though a rat like Wormtail is running up and down his shoulders. He ponders that while Mrs. Zabini and Blaise pick out a bunch of different robes, almost all of them blue and green, and press them into his arms. The room to change in is a huge, softly lit one with hovering clouds of mist instead of partitions, but no one can look through the mist and see Harry. There are also huge mirrors along one wall.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s because he is still used to the Dursleys, Harry decides after a few minutes of struggling into one of the blue robes and then staring doubtfully at himself in the mirror. He honestly doesn\u2019t know whether he looks good or not.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t want to think that everything bad in his life goes back to the Dursleys, but that <em>is </em>kind of the way it is. After hearing so much during his childhood about being a burden on his relatives, Harry was immensely relieved to discover he had gold in the wizarding world. He would pay his own way. He had enough to buy sweets when he wanted and all the things he needed for school. If something was so expensive that he couldn\u2019t buy it himself, then he just didn\u2019t buy it.</p>\n<p>Knowing that he has rich people who actually want to buy gifts for him is\u2026</p>\n<p>Not something he\u2019s had before.</p>\n<p>Harry gives one final tug on the sleeve of the blue robes and steps out. He really likes the color, the dark shimmering blue of the Mediterranean that he and Blaise have visited a few times now, but he isn\u2019t sure about how good it looks on <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at that, Blaise!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry actually jumps when Mrs. Zabini stands up and says that. Her eyes are just so full of <em>approval </em>that it\u2019s stunning. Harry finds himself almost freezing in place as Mrs. Zabini comes over to nod and inspect him and touch the material of the sleeve and exclaim.</p>\n<p>He looks at Blaise.</p>\n<p>Blaise is smiling, like his mother, but there\u2019s an edge to his smile that isn\u2019t there with hers. He comes over when Mrs. Zabini declares that they will definitely be taking the robes and bends down to whisper in Harry\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019m picturing tugging those robes right off you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry starts and blushes, Blaise smiles more broadly, and Mrs. Zabini says, \u201cAh, Harry. One smile from my son is worth all the robes I could purchase for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry relaxes. He does believe them, the way that he never really believed the Dursleys when he was younger than they used to promise him gifts as long as he \u201cbehaved.\u201d He does pull out his piece of parchment to write down, \u201c<em>Even if I wanted you to buy the whole shop</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s say, all the robes that would look equally good on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are making progress.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods to Mrs. Zabini and then winces as his headache picks up. It feels as though something with claws is trying to climb out of his skull right around his eyesockets. He picks up his cooled mango juice and takes a long sip.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Horcrux is coming loose.\u201d Mrs. Zabini no longer sweats as much as she did the first few Legilimency sessions, but Harry still sees her cast a Cooling Charm on herself as she shifts back into her seat. Then she reaches for her own mango juice and drains most of the glass. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel any results beyond the headaches and pain during the sessions, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a liar,\u201d Blaise says. He lounges on a stone bench behind Harry, his usual seat now, and leans over to tap Harry on the knee. \u201cI know that you have headaches outside the sessions. I see the way you rub that scar when we\u2019re playing Exploding Snap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s words of protest die on his tongue. It\u2019s not like he could speak them in an understandable way, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that true, Harry?\u201d Mrs. Zabini looks terribly sad.</p>\n<p>Harry stares at the far wall of the gardens, where grape vines wrap around a small stone arch, and hisses, \u201c<em>I don\u2019t want you to worry about me.</em>\u201d Then he ends up writing it down, because Blaise isn\u2019t as tolerant of Hermione\u2014who would put up with utterances she couldn\u2019t understand if she felt she could read Harry\u2019s face\u2014and showing it to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe worry far more when you don\u2019t tell us the truth,\u201d Blaise says quietly. He squeezes Harry\u2019s shoulder and reaches up to touch his cheek, once, as lightly as the sleeves of Harry\u2019s new robes rest on his arms. \u201cIt makes us think that you\u2019re concealing something catastrophic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Harry.\u201d Mrs. Zabini leans forwards, and there\u2019s no weariness in her eyes now; they\u2019re blazing. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever think you need to flinch and hide from us. Please remember that, next to my son, you are the most important person in the world to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry freezes. He was <em>not </em>ready to hear that. He actually jumps to his feet. That was the way he processed some of the horrible news he got at Hogwarts: he would run away and be alone.</p>\n<p>But Blaise\u2019s arm falls across his shoulder, and he turns Harry around to stare into his eyes, and Harry shivers and ends up accepting Blaise\u2019s embrace helplessly. Parseltongue kept people away at school, but when it doesn\u2019t, Harry finds that he\u2019s actually a <em>lot </em>more vulnerable. He can\u2019t use words to dazzle them and make them think nothing\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t try to hide from me,\u201d Blaise murmurs into his ear.</p>\n<p>And, well, what can Harry do with that declaration but accept it and treasure it?</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw the scar on his arm, Blaise. I know what that came from as much as you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise turns to face his mother. Harry is asleep upstairs, exhausted from the Legilimency session today. He\u2019s exhausted by the sense that\u2019s slowly settling on him, too, Blaise knows, that Dumbledore must have known about the Horcrux and might have planned to have him kill himself.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not what his mother wants to talk about now, so Blaise nods. \u201cI know. There were rumors about what Slytherin\u2019s monster really was, in my second year. I see now that they were true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>basilisk</em>. How did he survive a basilisk bite, Blaise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Blaise sits down heavily on the bench that stands in the cool shade of the veranda and looks out at the sloping roofs below him. The sea gleams in the distance, and Blaise longs to be beside it, sitting on the beach and watching the waves run in. \u201cI thought Harry was telling me most things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does seem honest when we ask him to be.\u201d Mother sits down next to him, looking nearly as exhausted. Blaise gives her an anxious look, but she only smiles a little and shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a migraine that will go away, dearest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he keeps all these secrets he just <em>never thinks to mention</em>.\u201d Blaise swallows. \u201cMother, the Muggles he lived with abused him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother only closes her eyes and nods. \u201cI saw that much in his memories, Blaise. We kept him away from them this summer. You think that he will try to go back to them when he returns to Britain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise makes the declaration, and he knows as he makes it that he\u2019s setting himself up for conflict with powerful enemies. Dumbledore and the people who follow Dumbledore want Harry to go back to that horrible place. Blaise doesn\u2019t know their reasons, but he knows he could listen to them and they <em>wouldn\u2019t matter.</em> Nothing matters next to the pain that Harry was forced to endure there.</p>\n<p>And nothing matters next to the urgency of keeping Harry away from people who would do that to him\u2014both the Muggles and the wizards who enabled the Muggles.</p>\n<p>Mother is silent for a moment. Then she turns to face him and clasps his hand. Blaise looks down at their joined hands and remembers so well when there were only the two of them against the world, in his childhood, right after his father died and before Mother punished his murderers and inherited the wealth of the men she killed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI always said that I would support you and whoever you chose, Blaise. I mean that still. But we are going to have much more of a time with this than I thought when I believed you would fall in love with some sweet Italian boy and we might only face conflict based on the color of his skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles, looking down at his mother\u2019s fingers. She wears only a single ring, the mourning ring that she put on the night of his father\u2019s funeral. A spun braid of white gold and platinum, its stone is a ruby that Blaise knows symbolizes eternal love.</p>\n<p>Someday, he is going to set a ring with a stone like that on Harry\u2019s finger. But <em>his </em>beloved is going to be alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Mother. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry takes a careful breath as he looks at the letter lying on the table in front of him. It came this morning, delivered by a tawny owl that Mrs. Zabini checked over carefully for spells before allowing the bird to drop off the message.</p>\n<p>The writing on the outside of the envelope is Sirius\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he knew about the plan to get you to return to your relatives\u2019?\u201d Blaise asks casually from across the table.</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019ll never know if I don\u2019t read it</em>, Harry writes. But for all that, he doesn\u2019t reach across his plate of perfect baked fish for the letter.</p>\n<p>The crushing realization that at least one person he trusted <em>knew </em>he was a Horcrux is settling deeper and deeper into his soul and bones with every passing day. What is he going to do if he finds out that Sirius knew? And lied to him about it? And was okay with Harry marching to his death, because Dumbledore said so?</p>\n<p>Part of Harry protests violently that Sirius never would have let it go if he knew. But on the other hand, Harry doesn\u2019t actually know Sirius that well. They never got to spend much time together. Sirius was a member of the Order of the Phoenix in the first war. He\u2019s never actually <em>done </em>anything about Harry having to go back to the Dursleys. Sirius trusts Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>Just the fact that Harry doesn\u2019t might be enough to drive a wedge between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you if he\u2019s a liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glances up and nods at Blaise. \u201c<em>I know</em>,\u201d he says, then writes it, and then he picks up the letter and manages to open it in spite of the way his hands tremble.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Harry</em>,</p>\n<p>\n<em>I don\u2019t know why you ran away like that. Isn\u2019t it enough to know that I wouldn\u2019t flinch when I heard you hissing? You could come to Grimmauld Place and no one would run away from you. I don\u2019t think even Ron flinches when he hears it now, does he? </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m worried about you. It would be one thing if you ran away to stay with the Weasleys, but to do it with a Slytherin you just met and you\u2019ve only been dating for a few months is something else. I don\u2019t think that your Zabini cast a spell on you, since I know you can resist the Imperius Curse, but he must have told you </em>something <em>about Dumbledore that isn\u2019t true. The Headmaster would never hurt you.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Please write back to me, at least. And please consider coming back to Britain. I can\u2019t help you from so far away. I miss you.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Love, </em><br>\n<em>Sirius.</em></p>\n<p>Harry sighs and puts the letter down. It\u2019s not any different than he expected, really. He <em>knows </em>Sirius loves him, but Harry can\u2019t trust him as long as he\u2019s reporting to Dumbledore. And who knows how long he\u2019s going to do that? Who knows what kinds of things he would tell Dumbledore if Harry was foolish enough to write back to him without some kind of filter?</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I see?\u201d</p>\n<p>Just the fact that Blaise asks puts him leagues ahead of some of the competition. Harry nods and pushes the letter across the table to Blaise.</p>\n<p>Blaise reads it in silence, and then glances at Harry for permission again before he gives it to his mother. Blaise holds Harry\u2019s wrist tightly, but Mrs. Zabini swears aloud and drops the letter. \u201cSuch mealy-mouthed promises,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cI don\u2019t think that your godfather knows where his ultimate loyalty should lie. And he distrusts Blaise because of his House? I had thought most adults, even in Britain, discarded such concerns once they graduated from Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thinks about trying to explain the whole complicated situation around Sirius, but even the thought makes him tired. He only writes down, <em>He spent a long time in Azkaban. I think that sort of broke his mind.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOr froze his sense of time. Yes, that would make sense. Exposure to Dementors is of no use to anyone except those who want to avoid making the hard decisions.\u201d Mrs. Zabini leans across the table. \u201cYou may write whatever you like back to him, Harry. But I\u2019ll ask that you not use one of our owls. We\u2019ll take you to a postal service that has anonymous birds. Too much chance that someone of Dumbledore\u2019s caliber might be able to use magic to trace one of our owls back to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shudders. <em>That would be horrible, </em>he writes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. But it will not happen.\u201d Mrs. Zabini exchanges a look with Blaise that Harry doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cAnd in the meantime, we will step up your Legilimency sessions. I would like to make sure that the Horcrux is gone completely before you fall under Dumbledore\u2019s purview again.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to hear about the basilisk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry starts. He and Blaise have been lying in the garden for hours, charms on their skin to prevent it from burning, and simply soaking in the sunlight and the soft, rustling atmosphere around them. Harry loves the villa, the way that shaded places loom around sudden corners, and how many vines fill the garden, and the luscious smell of grapes, but what he might love most of all\u2014besides the Zabinis\u2014is the weather.</p>\n<p>Harry turns on his side, somewhat disarranging the blanket that Blaise spread beneath him before he\u2019d allow Harry to lie down. Harry tried to tell him in writing he was used to harder things than the soft dirt of the garden, but that only made Blaise angry, so Harry stopped. Now, he blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWondering how I found out?\u201d Blaise gestures at Harry\u2019s arms, bare to the shoulder in the shirt that Harry\u2019s wearing. \u201cThat\u2019s a scar from a basilisk, Harry. We had an ancestor who faced one down, and left a detailed statue with the mark reproduced exactly. I want to know about it, and I want to know how you survived.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scowls at him.</p>\n<p>Blaise tilts his body towards him without rising off his own blanket. His face is so soft and intense that Harry would glance away if he could, but he seems caught in place. He can do nothing but stare, and Blaise reaches up to brush Harry\u2019s wild hair back behind his ear. He kisses Harry once before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to know everything about you. I want to <em>have </em>everything about you. I won\u2019t be satisfied with less. I want to keep you. There\u2019s not going to be any shadowed corner of your soul where you have to keep secrets from me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I might want secrets, </em>Harry manages to write down, dazedly, on the scrap of parchment that Mrs. Zabini enchanted to follow him around. His words are jagged and rip through the paper because he\u2019s trying to write on the dirt.</p>\n<p>Blaise still manages to read them by adjusting the angle of his head a little. \u201cThen you can have them. But you don\u2019t have to keep things secret for fear of frightening me away, or any other reason.\u201d He traces the shell of Harry\u2019s ear with his fingers this time, and Harry shivers and presses his lower body into the blanket so that Blaise can\u2019t see the result of his simple touches. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. Everything about you, I accept. Every part of you, I want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I love you, </em>Harry mouths, and watches Blaise\u2019s dark eyes brighten.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too. But I think you still owe me a story of how you survived a basilisk bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes more than one sheet of parchment, and even more than one quill, when the one Harry has breaks because he\u2019s pressing so hard. But the whole time, Blaise lies beside him, his arm draped over Harry\u2019s shoulder, encouraging him with sharp angry hisses of breath and his whispers of, \u201cThe bastards.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Harry finishes, Blaise is silent, his head on Harry\u2019s shoulder, his arms clasped tightly around him. Then he says, \u201cWe need to increase your lessons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. <em>What? </em>He doesn\u2019t get a chance to write it down before Blaise seems to sense what he\u2019s thinking and shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot lessons in Legilimency. But you could have died before I\u2014before I even got to know you. I could have been here without you.\u201d Blaise\u2019s voice is thickening with emotion, the Italian accent that Harry doesn\u2019t usually notice coming out in force. \u201cI could have lived my life through without finding someone to love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry simply stares. He doesn\u2019t believe that Blaise would ever spend his life alone. He\u2019s too handsome, too witty, too <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to train you in defensive magic. Spells that are more common in Italy, spells that your enemies would be less likely to know the counters to.\u201d Blaise kisses his ear. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to go to some of the shops and look for rarer books. Who knows, we might even find something on Parselmouths. There are books banned in Britain that are available here.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I can\u2019t read Italian, </em>Harry manages to write, while his brain spins.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll translate for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise manages to make even that sound like a dirty promise. Harry shivers and leans in for a kiss, and Blaise is more than happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I have the end of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry mops literal sweat from his brow and leans back from Mrs. Zabini. They\u2019re at the small table in the garden, and Blaise has mango juice and potions waiting for them as usual. Harry swallows the Restorative Draught and waits for the world to stop spinning before he writes down, <em>What do you mean? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cPicture the Horcrux as like a rope, extending through your head and down the back of your mind into the distance, reaching towards Voldemort.\u201d Mrs. Zabini takes a long gulp of mango juice, and Harry imitates her once the taste of the potion is no longer making his mouth sting. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look at all the way you might expect a living Horcrux to look. I am convinced that is one reason Voldemort does not know what it is. He probably thinks it a connection forged by Dark Arts. He knew it existed, enough to tie the Parseltongue curse to it, but not to identify it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shivers. <em>Thank God for that, </em>he writes.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini nods, while Blaise leans more heavily on Harry, as if he wants to shove him off the bench. \u201cBut I have one end of the rope, and I have maintained my grip on it despite its attempts to shake me off when I am reaching towards it with Legilimency. Now we can pull.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>How are we going to do that?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad that you asked.\u201d Mrs. Zabini\u2019s smile is grim and sad, but Harry finds that he doesn\u2019t mind, not if they\u2019re finally on the verge of getting rid of this terrible curse. \u201cWe are going to make sure that you have a comfortable place to lie, rather like a hospital room in our villa. Then we are going to pull on the rope, and keep pulling until it unravels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you know what usually destroys Horcruxes, Mother.\u201d Blaise has gone still. \u201cBasilisk venom and Fiendfyre. We\u2019re not going to subject Harry to <em>either </em>of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says calmly, which fills Harry with relief for a stress he didn\u2019t even realize he was experiencing. \u201cBut this Horcrux is unusual not only in the way it is bound to a living being, but also in its <em>shape</em>. I do not think that Voldemort crafted it that way on purpose. He may even have distorted its shape further with the Parseltongue curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWhich means it\u2019s weakened. And easier to destroy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Zabini pats Harry\u2019s shoulder, and then reaches up and ruffles his hair. It\u2019s a gesture that\u2019s finally stopped bringing stupid tears to his eyes, which never should have been there in the first place, because it\u2019s just a <em>gesture</em>. \u201cWould you be able to begin the removal soon, Harry? It will require you to be rested, not hungry, and able to nearly fall asleep in my presence.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I trust you that much now, </em>Harry writes.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini stares him in the eye, although Harry is exhausted enough that he can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s touching his mind with Legilimency or not. Then she exchanges a glance with Blaise. \u201cNo,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cNot right now. I think that we\u2019ll wait a few days. That way, we can make sure that you sleep well if you have a bad night tonight, and we can fill you as full of food as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we can have a few days together,\u201d Blaise says, while his arm seems to get heavier on Harry\u2019s shoulder than ever.</p>\n<p>Harry glances at him. <em>But we have days together all the time? </em>He wants to say it, but he doesn\u2019t want to write it, because then Mrs. Zabini would see it, and he doesn\u2019t\u2014he just feels weird about her seeing it.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini gets up and moves a few steps away from the table and turns her back, though. So Harry writes down the question and twists the parchment around for Blaise to see.</p>\n<p>Blaise murmurs to him, \u201cWe have another villa near the coast that Mother doesn\u2019t visit often because it reminds her too much of Father. We can go there, the two of us, for the days before the removal. We can sleep as much as we like, eat as much as we like, and swim in the ocean. And\u2014do those things that I\u2019m too shy to do much of with Mother in the same house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry feels his eyes widen and his heart begin to pound with excitement. <em>Oh. Oh. Oh. </em>Yes, he wants that. He\u2019s wanted that for a while. But Blaise was holding back, and the only thing Harry could think of was that he wanted to wait until the Horcrux was gone.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t dare <em>ask</em>, in case the answer was something else and a lot more disappointing. But now that he knows what the problem is\u2014</p>\n<p>He reaches out and holds Blaise\u2019s wrist hard, the way Blaise does so often to him. He does it with his left hand, so he can keep his right hand free to scribble down, <em>I\u2019d love to do that. I\u2019d love to go away with you.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something else you never thought you\u2019d get to do, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise\u2019s voice is grieved. Harry kisses the middle of his forehead, the same place that the lightning bolt scar would be if Blaise had one, and just shakes his own head. He doesn\u2019t want sadness right now. He leans his head on Blaise\u2019s shoulder so both of them can see the parchment at once as he writes, <em>I know, but you keep expanding my vision of what\u2019s possible.</em></p>\n<p>Blaise, finally, smiles.</p>\n<p>Harry wanders through the villa that Blaise brought him to, staring. It\u2019s smaller than the one Mrs. Zabini lives in, but as if <em>that </em>matters. It\u2019s filled with huge and shining windows, chairs that look as if Harry would fall asleep if he sat in them, a couch that actually wraps all the way around the veranda, a small garden planted exclusively with silver flowers, and a dueling room that gleams with white marble and gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise sounds a little uncertain. Harry turns around, smiling, and holds out his hand. Blaise comes up and clasps it, kissing the back of it, while Harry nods emphatically.</p>\n<p>He wishes that he could say what he wants to in English, but he settles for scribbling down, <em>I can\u2019t believe how beautiful.</em></p>\n<p>Blaise abruptly smiles in a way that unsettles Harry a little, and leads him upstairs. Harry follows him, wondering. He saw a bedroom earlier that he assumed would be his, but now he realizes it didn\u2019t have his trunk in it. He didn\u2019t see any of the other rooms on the first floor.</p>\n<p>Then Blaise opens a door that has gleaming cherry wood panels, and Harry gasps at the size of the bedroom that lies beyond. It has multiple doors leading off it, one to a balcony, and it sparkles and shimmers with some of the same shades of blue that are on the robes Mrs. Zabini bought for Harry. There\u2019s one wall that is an actual <em>waterfall </em>tumbling slowly down in wavering streams, falling into a pool at the bottom that then channels the water back up the sides with magic.</p>\n<p>Harry turns to Blaise, his mouth open. Blaise answers the question before he can ask it. \u201cThis was my parents\u2019 bedroom when my father was alive. My mother is giving the whole thing to us. You won\u2019t have to sleep in that small bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry manages to look wondering enough that Blaise guesses his question without him having to ask it. \u201cI only made you think that you would be sleeping in the small bedroom because I wanted to see your face when you walked in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head, but he knows he\u2019s smiling. He flings his arms around Blaise and kisses him. Blaise promptly shoves him back into the wall, his hands and his mouth desperate. Harry blinks, but kisses him harder.</p>\n<p>When Blaise\u2019s hands are sliding under his shirt and Harry\u2019s head is whirling with dizziness, Blaise pulls back to breathe, \u201cWill you let me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. Honestly, he was ready for Blaise to go further weeks ago, but Blaise really <em>is </em>shy when his mother is in the same house.</p>\n<p><em>If she knows what we\u2019re doing now, then I can be just as shy, </em>Harry thinks, and feels his face heat up to the point that he almost loses interest. But then Blaise pulls his own shirt off, and Harry\u2019s whole body slams to a halt.</p>\n<p>Blaise <em>shines</em>. His dark skin looks even softer and brighter than Harry knows it really is in the muffled light of the bedroom. And he\u2019s looking at Harry with a self-satisfied curve of his lips that\u2019s immensely attractive as he lays his shirt down on a chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d Blaise says.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Harry hisses, and doesn\u2019t feel embarrassed about the Parseltongue word when he sees how Blaise\u2019s eyes light up even more. He reaches out and traces one finger around Blaise\u2019s right nipple. Blaise hisses out a (wordless) complaint of his own while his nipple pebbles gently under Harry\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushes even more deeply while he takes his glasses and then his shirt off. He wonders what Blaise will think of him. Not only is Harry skinnier than Blaise and just not as beautiful, he has a bunch of scars.</p>\n<p>But Blaise takes a harsh breath, and Harry relaxes a little. That doesn\u2019t sound like someone who is disgusted by what he sees.</p>\n<p>\u201cSweet Merlin, Harry.\u201d Blaise eases over to him, as if scared that he\u2019ll run. His hands trace the scars, Harry\u2019s few muscles, the line of hair that trails down beneath his trousers. As much as Harry can make out the expression on his face when he looks at him without his glasses, Blaise is almost <em>awed</em>. \u201cI never realized that you\u2019d survived so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s a good way to think of it,</em>\u201d Harry says, and then wants to flinch and hide his face when he realizes that he\u2019s still speaking in Parseltongue. Because of course he is. Because of course that curse hasn\u2019t changed, and he can\u2019t escape from it even in this private moment with Blaise.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t duck your head,\u201d Blaise says softly, and lifts his chin with three fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until you can speak in English again, but I fell in love with you when you were silent, and this is still you.\u201d And he kisses Harry before Harry can think of some way to slink off and get rid of the embarrassment.</p>\n<p>After that, it\u2019s just <em>hot, </em>the way that Blaise leans against him, trapping him near the wall, and won\u2019t take his hands from Harry\u2019s scars, and has his mouth fastened over Harry\u2019s and his tongue thrusting. And the bed beneath them when they finally get there is hot, too, no matter the waterfall on the wall next to them.</p>\n<p>Blaise\u2019s hands are roving, now, dipping down and grasping Harry. Harry\u2019s cry feels like something ripped out of him, the rippling noise up his throat like something someone else made. But Blaise\u2019s mouth is still kissing him and Blaise\u2019s arms are still holding him, and Blaise keeps him grounded.</p>\n<p>Then Harry reaches down, deciding he can be bold, too, and grasps Blaise\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Blaise bucks and grunts, but Harry makes him lean back enough that they can get his trousers off, and then Harry\u2019s. Blaise is still wearing pants, which makes Harry roll his eyes as he drags them away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch, that hurt when they snapped against me, Harry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wouldn\u2019t have been able to answer even if he still spoke English. He\u2019s staring at Blaise\u2019s erection, dark and flushed, curving straight up in a way that makes Harry wonder what it would be like to have it in his mouth, in his arse\u2014</p>\n<p>Well, right now he\u2019s going to have it in his fingers. He reaches out and gives Blaise a rough stroke, and Blaise\u2019s mouth drops open and his hips snap up.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me touch you, too,\u201d Blaise whispers. Harry nods, but he can\u2019t look down as Blaise frees his cock. It always looks so weird to him, even the times that he\u2019s wanked in the shower or just washed himself there.</p>\n<p>Blaise makes a soft sound that\u2019s all but ripped out of him the way Harry\u2019s cry was, though, so he must like it. Reassured, Harry strokes Blaise from the root to the tip, and Blaise\u2019s next sound is a lot louder. He rolls on top of Harry, and Harry parts his thighs and welcomes him there, so their cocks and not just their hands can touch each other.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hot and wet and sliding, and Harry doesn\u2019t think that he\u2019s ever felt this good in his <em>life</em>. Blaise\u2019s eyes are right there staring into his, his hand is going up and down on the part of Harry\u2019s shaft he can still reach, he\u2019s making little thrusts, sweat is getting trapped between them, the air is soft with the hissing of the waterfall around them, Harry opens his mouth and thrusts his tongue out and Blaise\u2019s tongue is there\u2014</p>\n<p>He comes in a shivering rush of pleasure, so good and consuming and happy and <em>shared</em>. Blaise is behind him a few seconds later, muffling his latest growl-noise in Harry\u2019s neck as he bows his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d Blaise says a few seconds or minutes or hours later. His free hand is languidly combing through Harry\u2019s hair. His other hand is still trapped between them, and Harry doesn\u2019t want to think about how he\u2019s soaked it.</p>\n<p>But Blaise doesn\u2019t mind. He stands up with a lazy smile, twisting a little to the side and flexing so that Harry can look at his legs, and then turns around and goes to one of the doors on the far side of the room. Harry shuts his eyes and drifts. Now that he\u2019s free to concentrate on something other than the best moment of his <em>life</em>, he finds the waterfall\u2019s soft hissing like a lullaby. He could probably fall asleep listening to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBudge up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opens one lazy eye. Blaise has come back, and he\u2019s washed himself off. He has a wet cloth he does the same to Harry with, although Harry jumps and yelps at first because the water is too cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Blaise whispers, and casts a Warming Charm on the cloth. Harry lies back with more pleasure as he\u2019s wiped down, and looks up into Blaise\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Blaise murmurs.</p>\n<p>Harry still can\u2019t say it, but he can reach out and curl his fingers around Blaise\u2019s and squeeze hard, and sometimes, that\u2019s just as good.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The days they spend at the seaside villa are so good that Harry cherishes them later, only taking them out to look at sometimes, like a jewel that has to be wrapped up in case its luster dulls with too much looking. He and Blaise have sex, and watch the silver flowers blooming in the garden.</p>\n<p>They go down to the beach, the sands of it clear and silvery, and an inspiration for the flowers in the garden, Blaise tells him. His mother cast a spell at his father that failed and for some reason colored the sand and pebbles this way. Blaise and Harry lie side by side on the softer parts of the beach and watch the sunset blooming across the water.</p>\n<p>Harry learns to swim far more in those few days than he ever has, and without gillyweed, even. Blaise holds him up as they paddle through the water, and Harry trusts him. He knows that Blaise will never drop him or upend him or let him float away.</p>\n<p>The kiss of the water against his skin is warm, but not as warm as Blaise\u2019s kiss.</p>\n<p>Blaise teaches him offensive spells that, even when they\u2019re making the air crackle or the wooden shields that for some reason the villa is full of crack apart, seem as gentle as the rest of their time there. And he takes every excuse he can to stand behind Harry and wrap his hands around Harry\u2019s on the wand and guide his movements. If he spends some of that time sniffing Harry\u2019s neck instead, Harry isn\u2019t one to blame him.</p>\n<p>Every night, they fall asleep in the large bedroom to the murmuring of the water on the wall and outside the windows.</p>\n<p>The only sour note marring those green and blue days is another letter from Sirius. Harry picks it up and stares half-helplessly at it. He honestly has no idea what to do with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was in the one you wrote back to him the first time?\u201d Blaise is lounging on the beach, impossibly perfect as always with the sun and the breeze playing over his dark skin. Harry wants to lean over and lick him, but he refrains.</p>\n<p>Harry tears open the envelope and uses it to write on without looking at the letter right now. <em>I said that I was somewhere safe and to please not listen when Dumbledore or other people told him I wasn\u2019t. I said you were the person I wanted to be with. That was about it.</em></p>\n<p>Blaise sits up to read that, and then nods. \u201cThat makes sense, because you aren\u2019t sure what other secrets he might betray.\u201d He looks deeply into Harry\u2019s eyes and lifts a hand to push the hair away from his fringe. \u201cListen. Whatever you want to say, that\u2019s all right. I\u2019m not going to blame you if you want to tell him more specifics.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>But I really don\u2019t, </em>Harry writes down, and then finally picks up the letter and turns it around.</p>\n<p><em>I want you to come home, </em>the letter begins, and Harry\u2019s heart softens, but only until he gets to the next line.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If that means listening to Dumbledore, then that\u2019s what you have to do, Harry. Dumbledore may have made some mistakes this year, but he\u2019ll protect you with everything he has. Please don\u2019t say that your Zabini taught you to mistrust him. Of course he would mistrust Dumbledore! He probably mistrusts him on purpose, because he\u2019s a Slytherin.</em>\n</p>\n<p>There is no signature this time, but Sirius probably figured out that he wouldn\u2019t need one.</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes and massages his forehead tiredly. His scar hasn\u2019t ached in the last few days, but it seems ready to start. He looks helplessly at Blaise, who waits for his nod before he picks up his letter and reads it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is the sort of conflict that you\u2019re not going to be able to address until you\u2019re back with him in person,\u201d Blaise finally says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not hopeless, but he wants you to come back, and you\u2019re not going back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry starts to answer, then writes down, <em>Would you even let me go back?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Blaise is giving him a gentle smile that nevertheless has its edge. It reminds Harry of how Blaise smiled at him right after Umbridge died. \u201cI told you how I felt about the basilisk biting you and almost destroying my chance to meet you. The same thing applies here. Either Dumbledore would get hold of you and convince you to die for that bloody Horcrux, or you would end up depressed and longing for me. I say that we skip some steps and just keep you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans his head on Blaise\u2019s shoulder. Then he nods. <em>I\u2019m not going to worry about it until after we get the Horcrux out, then, </em>he writes on the last portion of clear paper on the back of the envelope.</p>\n<p>Blaise kisses his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped you would say.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus on my voice, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lies back on the pillows that Mrs. Zabini and Blaise arranged in the large drawing room of the villa, and breathes slowly in and out. He would have preferred to do this outside, but Mrs. Zabini says that they can\u2019t have any distractions. Harry has to hear her voice and nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to slip into your mind. But this time, I am going to take the end of the Horcrux that extends like a rope from your mind to Voldemort\u2019s and I am going to <em>pull</em>. Do you understand? We will pull until the Horcrux comes free.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds terrifying and painful. But then again, the curse has already brought its share of terror and pain into Harry\u2019s life. He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Now focus on my voice. Hear me speaking as I slip into your mind, but don\u2019t focus on the way that I am grasping hold of the Horcrux. Hear my voice. Hear it holding you to the present, not letting you slip away into the distance\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, Harry can\u2019t concentrate on Mrs. Zabini\u2019s voice for long. It\u2019s Blaise\u2019s hand encircling his wrist that keeps him grounded as he feels her grasp the end of the Horcrux, and everything around him goes deep and dim and muffled. His heartbeat seems to pound ten times more slowly. He is in blackness. He floats away.</p>\n<p>But then there is <em>pain</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry screams. He knows it. Mrs. Zabini\u2019s voice is murmuring to him, but Harry can\u2019t hear her words. He writhes on the pillows, and the black and yellow agony tears the inside of his head apart. Hot needles sink into his stomach and rend his limbs from each other. He opens his mouth and vomits anguish. He tries to roll onto his side, but the nest of pillows holds him still.</p>\n<p>And Blaise\u2019s hand. Harry can feel Blaise\u2019s hand. He clings to that with barely restrained violence.</p>\n<p>He will come back for Blaise.</p>\n<p>The pain shreds his mind. Harry can see snatches of memory drifting past: the cupboard at the Dursleys\u2019, the primary school roof that he once accidentally Apparated to, Sirius bending over him and grinning, the Gryffindor common room, the villa by the sea.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you die during this, you\u2019ll never be in the villa with Blaise again.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry channels all the fierce strength of his desire to live into those memories. He <em>wants </em>to live, he <em>wants </em>to keep existing, because if he dies, there\u2019s no more Blaise and no more memories they could make in the future.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini says something. Blaise responds in a low, tense voice. Harry turns his head towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Blaise, keep speaking to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hears that much before she pulls again, unraveling something from his soul, and he screams again. Blaise bends over him, and speaks softly in Italian. He must know that Harry can\u2019t make out the words, and so speaking in English isn\u2019t important. He keeps his hand running up and down Harry\u2019s shoulder, and Harry can picture his fingers perfectly, everything from his thumbnail to the exact shade of his skin to the wrinkles in his knuckles.</p>\n<p>Harry is going to come back to him. He is not going to be defeated by this.</p>\n<p>He hates the Horcrux\u2014</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s the wrong move, because the Horcrux turns on him gleefully and clings to him, feeding on the hatred. Harry tries to think of battling Voldemort, killing the basilisk and defending the Philosopher\u2019s Stone from Quirrell, but that doesn\u2019t work. The fight is destroying him, and the Horcrux wants to help. It wants to possess his body and make it kill his friends.</p>\n<p>It wants to laugh in Blaise\u2019s face.</p>\n<p><em>No</em>! Harry roars out, and Blaise\u2019s voice falters for a second as if he screamed it aloud. But Harry knows the trick of it, now. He lifts the memory of love against the Horcrux.</p>\n<p>The memories of his parents in the Mirror of Erised. Sitting next to Ron and Hermione in the Gryffindor common room and feeling ridiculously satisfied to have such great friends. Believing, for one shining moment, that he might get to live with Sirius.</p>\n<p>And Blaise. Blaise making love with him, holding his wrist, smiling at him sweetly and asking why he thought he\u2019d be allowed to go back to Britain, telling him that he can put off answering stupid letters, being furious on his behalf at the notion that he might have to die to destroy the Horcrux.</p>\n<p>The clinging tendrils fall away from him. Harry thinks he hears something sob, and laughs at it. <em>If you can\u2019t bear love, the greatest thing in the world, what are you, anyway?</em></p>\n<p>And <em>that\u2019s </em>right, too. The burning sun of his love turns on the Horcrux and withers it to ash like the sun of Italy warming the waves. Harry tears free with a gasp and a shriek, and at the same moment, hears Mrs. Zabini shouting something in Italian. Harry doesn\u2019t know what it is, only that it sounds urgent, but he\u2019s fallen back among his nest of pillows and barely has the strength to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a harsh sizzling sound that he does, in fact, open them for.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini is standing with something clutched in her hand. Harry can only describe it as looking like a bolt of rotten lightning. She flings it from her with a small shudder and dusts her hands off, shaking her head.</p>\n<p>Harry watches apprehensively as it flies, but it breaks apart long before it hits the wall of the villa and disappears into less than ash. Harry discovers that he is able to breathe again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says with deep satisfaction, and manages to kneel among the pillows instead of fall. Her headscarf is dangling off her ear; she rearranges it and reaches over to Harry. \u201cThe Horcrux is gone, my dear. Can you say something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turns to look at Blaise, who is sweating and shivering the way his mother usually does after one of their Legilimency sessions. Harry reaches towards him, and Blaise immediately grasps his wrist in the familiar way he has, not taking his eyes from Harry.</p>\n<p>And Harry draws a deep breath, and speaks in English for the first time in thirteen months.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cBlaise.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Blaise hears the sound of the word, and it\u2019s as if some chain has fallen away from his heart. And <em>he </em>falls.</p>\n<p>Headlong, furiously, down and down and down. Into love deeper and more profound than he would ever have believed could exist.</p>\n<p>He knows now how Mother felt about Father. He knows now why she became a murderer, making sure to destroy the people who profited from his death, when she lost him.</p>\n<p>He leans down and kisses Harry fiercely, feeling the hands that rise up and curl around his neck, and not despising the tears that he can taste underneath his lips.</p>\n<p>He answers, \u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>The End.</b>\n</p>"
