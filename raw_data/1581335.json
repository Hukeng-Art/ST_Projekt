  "text": "<p>They\u2019ve decided to start producing Bucky Bears again, now that he\u2019s all shiny and redeemed and fighting for good on this big Avengers misfits team. Steve sees them sitting in the window of a tiny neighborhood toy store in Brooklyn - an employee has painted the glass, flexing their bragging rights about being the home of Bucky Barnes before he was the Winter Soldier, and Steve rolls his eyes and braces himself before going inside, because hipsters really seem to like him, but he hates what they\u2019ve done to his old home - and can\u2019t resist buying one. Bucky\u2019s been back with him, with them, and in recovery for nine months now, and Steve thinks this will make a nice little celebratory gift, a recall to a funny memory and, considering the tweaks that the manufacturers have made to the new Bucky Bear, an acknowledgment that Steve knows Bucky has changed irrevocably, can still do good as this different person. </p>\n<p>Bucky holds it in his hands and stares down at it, blinking slowly, completely silent. Steve\u2019s explaining the whole thing to the rest of the team, how popular the original Bucky Bears were during the war, how any mail the Commandos ever got delivered to them was always full of letters for Bucky with photos of smiling children holding American flags and Bucky Bears tight to their chests, how even though Bucky was a sniper he was still considered more appropriate to cuddle with at night than a stuffed toy Captain America. Clint\u2019s eyes have gone wide with excitement at this information and Bruce grins, admits to having been passed an old and faded hand-me-down Bucky Bear from his mother as a kid. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, where the hell is it now?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cDo you have any idea how much money you could make if you auctioned that off? An original Bucky Bear once owned by a tiny Hulk?\u201d </p>\n<p>Bruce shrugs and rubs at the back of his neck. \u201cIt was buried with her.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony says with a wince, reaching out to squeeze Bruce\u2019s shoulder in apology. \u201cHey, what if the toy companies started making little stuffed Avengers and Friends? Or just our Friends? Who do I talk to to get a Rhodey Bear made, is what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous that Steve\u2019s best friend has a cuddly counterpart and yours doesn\u2019t, Tony?\u201d Sam says, grinning. </p>\n<p>Bucky finally looks up. \u201cRhodey definitely deserves a bear,\u201d he says. Tony beams.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, he is going to be so glad to hear you said that,\u201d Tony says, phone suddenly in hand, pointing proudly at Bucky and walking backward out the room. \u201cTotally over the moon. He might even ask you out. Or kiss you. Just remember you brought this on yourself.\u201d Bucky looks back down at the bear in his hands.</p>\n<p>Clint sits down next to Bruce and pulls out his tablet, opens a window to ebay. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna find you a new old Bucky Bear, buddy.\u201d Bruce starts to shake his head, but Clint gets like this when Bruce talks about his parents, resolute and determined to fix all memories of Bruce\u2019s awful, abusive childhood. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be a good anger management tool?\u201d he asks, only because appealing to Bruce\u2019s more deliberately calming habits is a sure way to get him to relent. \u201cEven the Hulk could use something soft to snuggle.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room is quiet for a few moments, and Steve pokes Bucky\u2019s side. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep it if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he says lowly. \u201cI just, you know, I thought it would be--I thought it might--be nice.\u201d It sounds more pathetic once it\u2019s been said out loud. Steve frowns. \u201cYeah, you don\u2019t have to keep it--\u201d Bucky looks at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a little shiny gray arm,\u201d Bucky says, wiggling the stuffed arm in question, one of the tweaks made in the new model. It takes Steve a second to realize that Bucky\u2019s got a small smile on his face, actually looks a little bit proud around the eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, tentatively happy, and then, thinking Bucky\u2019s different pronoun use might be significant, \u201che does.\u201d Bucky looks down at the bear again, smiles bigger.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a therapy appointment,\u201d Bucky says after a silent minute. </p>\n<p>Sam stands and pulls on his jacket, elbows Steve and says, \u201cKeys, Steve? Steve, keys. Keys, Steve. Steve,\u201d and Steve rolls his eyes, makes a big deal out of retrieving Sam\u2019s car keys from his front pocket, and when he looks at Bucky again, the bear has disappeared. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s been doing weird stuff with his money since he was made aware of both the bank account in his name full of decades upon decades of government pay and Amazon.com. Giant boxes of every candy invented in the past seventy years have kept the entire Avengers team amped on sugar for nine weeks and counting. One Tuesday two months ago, UPS delivered the entire collection of Disney\u2019s animated films, which has supplied the features for the past twenty-two Tower Movie Nights and sparked countless arguments about animation eras in American cinema, all of which have gotten intensely heated in a surprisingly short amount of time. A heavy aluminum briefcase under Bucky\u2019s bed holds a dozen weapons of varying size and purpose, all of them pink and eerily pretty. Members of the team keep tripping over one Harry Potter book or another, could push them together to form the complete series four times over in English and German and French and Russian. </p>\n<p>Still, when Bucky breaks away from the team during cleanup of a particularly gruesome gigantic robot attack and returns carrying three huge cardboard boxes of Bucky Bears, the whole team is fairly concerned. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony says finally, across the table from Bucky at their usual shawarma joint, blessedly unaffected by their battle this time. \u201cBucky. Whatcha doing with all those Bucky Bears?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs, tears into his third wrap with his teeth bared like an animal. Tony grimaces. \u201cIf you get the Rhodey Bear made,\u201d Bucky says once his mouth isn\u2019t full of food, \u201cyou should try to get a version of him in a little Air Force uniform made, too. Not just the War Machine suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell him you called him War Machine and not Iron Patriot,\u201d Tony says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be thrilled. He\u2019ll change the name back immediately.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWill he kiss me for that, too?\u201d Bucky says, smirking. </p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Tony says. \u201cHe will definitely kiss you. Expert subject changing, by the way. You\u2019re a class act.\u201d Bucky laughs, wide and open and alarming.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy therapist thinks so, too,\u201d he says, and takes another bite.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The boxes of bears disappear the next day with Bucky, except that Bucky returns eventually, in time for dinner, and the bears do not. Clint almost asks, but Bucky\u2019s visibly on edge, dragging his fork across the plate just for the noise, wordlessly flexing his metal hand, not quite eating, hunching his shoulders up and ducking his head down. They all know better by now than to talk to Bucky when he\u2019s like this, all have had bruises and a few still have scars to show for trying once, or twice. Steve\u2019s is the only voice he responds to even remotely positively when he\u2019s in this particular kind of little black rain mood, and tonight Steve pushes his half-full plate away and settles his hand over Bucky\u2019s, stops the horrible dragging fork sound immediately. </p>\n<p>\u201cWanna go for a walk, Buck?\u201d he asks. Bucky tilts his head up just enough to be able to look at Steve\u2019s face. From his seat on the other side of Steve, Sam can\u2019t tell if Bucky\u2019s eyes are dead or just sad. A lot of times, it\u2019s the same look. \u201cWe can get some street food,\u201d Steve offers. \u201cAnd some Starbucks.\u201d One corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth lifts. Steve gives him a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll order for you. You won\u2019t even have to talk to anyone, or say the word \u2018macchiato.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re gone minutes later, Steve promising to bring back overpriced coffee for everybody, and as soon as the elevator doors close, Tony claps his hands gleefully and says, \u201cTheories on where the bears went. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Clint says, \u201cFuneral pyre,\u201d first, and everyone else agrees, even Thor, who knows well his funeral pyres. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Bucky buys another store\u2019s entire stock of Bucky Bears. It requires delivery by truck to the Tower, and Tony watches helplessly as delivery boys pushing dollies loaded tall with boxes stare in awe at the digs. </p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you live here?\u201d one of them asks Bucky as he picks up the last box. \u201cLike, all the time? Why do you ever go outside?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get claustrophobic,\u201d Bucky says, shoves a fifty in the guy\u2019s hand. The boy shakes his head, tries giving it back, but Bucky closes his metal hand in a fist and says, \u201cUh-uh. The others all got the same amount. If it makes you feel bad, give half of it to the first homeless vet you see.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kid nods, says, \u201cYou got it, Sergeant,\u201d and tries to salute. Even accounting for teenage awkwardness, it\u2019s all wrong, but Bucky doesn\u2019t seem to mind. </p>\n<p>\u201cAny reason why you\u2019re piling my house high with Bucky Bears?\u201d Tony asks after the delivery guys have all left. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get you to move out,\u201d Bucky says, all faux reluctance like it\u2019s a real confession. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get all of you to move out, leave this place for me and Stevie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony scoffs. \u201cAs if you and Steve would know what to do with a residence like this.\u201d Bucky makes a face like he\u2019s trying to smile only because he knows he should, and Tony\u2019s not having that, kicks Bucky\u2019s shoe with his and raises his eyebrows expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d Bucky says finally, quiet and serious. \u201cSteve deserves a place like this. Always did, but I could only ever give him couch cushions on dirty floors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a step up from couch cushions on dirt floors,\u201d Tony says, aiming for light and landing somewhere around desperate and anxious. He\u2019s ill-equipped to handle Bucky\u2019s mood swings, especially the ones brought on by a mere stray thought of Steve.</p>\n<p>Bucky smiles, for real this time, and looks at Tony. His eyes are clear and kind. Tony likes Bucky best with eyes like this. \u201cThat\u2019s a decent point,\u201d Bucky says, and then his grin goes lopsided, which can only mean - \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding about you moving out, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The bears and Bucky are gone the next day. Bucky doesn\u2019t return until after dinner this time, when the team is gathered around the TV on Thor\u2019s floor, eating from four laughably large bowls of popcorn and marathoning Criminal Minds. He flops down in the only empty chair, his body stretched over the seat and his legs and head dangling over the armrests. He blindly reaches back with his metal hand to steal popcorn from Bruce\u2019s bowl, and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s his aiming skills or Bruce\u2019s shoving the bowl under his open palm that lends to him getting a handful on the first try. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Bruce,\u201d Bucky says quietly, \u201cwhat do you know about genetic diseases?\u201d On Bucky\u2019s other side, Natasha loses interest in the episode, turns a confused look on Bucky and Bruce. </p>\n<p>Bruce blinks at Bucky only once before answering. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201ca fair amount. What exactly do you want to know? It sort of depends on the disease.\u201d Steve catches the last bit of Bruce\u2019s words and nearly gives himself whiplash turning to look at him and Bucky with silent concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with Juvenile Huntington\u2019s Disease,\u201d Bucky says. Clint turns toward them, leans forward with interest. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuntington\u2019s is pretty rare for juveniles,\u201d Bruce says thoughtfully. \u201cI think that\u2019s only about 10 percent of all cases. The symptoms are different for everyone, but usually with kids, seizures are really common, stiffness in the muscles, tremors, that sort of thing. They\u2019ll have trouble speaking or swallowing. Dementia symptoms are common, too.\u201d Tony and Sam are listening now, watching Bruce and Bucky with narrowed eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the treatments,\u201d Bucky says, \u201canticonvulsant drugs, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMostly, yeah,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cThose side effects can be pretty rough. Physical therapy is usually recommended, too, to help with the muscle function.\u201d Bucky clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLife expectancy?\u201d he asks, and Thor, the last man watching, is no longer watching.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo longer than twenty years, on average,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re talking juvenile - the earlier the onset, the more rapid the progression of the disease.\u201d Bucky rubs a hand over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no cure?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cMost research is focused on delaying the onset and developing therapies that help relieve the symptoms better than the current ones out there.\u201d Bucky sighs, heavy and sad, and Bruce frowns. \u201cCan I ask where all this is coming from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Bucky says, \u201cbut I won\u2019t answer.\u201d He sits up and swings out with his legs, is on his feet and across the room in a flash, and before he disappears across the hall into the elevator, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re all shitty spies.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>No more Bucky Bears enter the Avengers Tower. Bucky still sometimes goes missing for entire days, though, and returns at night almost exclusively to pick Bruce\u2019s brain. One night it\u2019s muscular dystrophy, another it\u2019s leukemia, and then it\u2019s lupus, and later cystic fibrosis. He\u2019s started cornering Bruce away from the others, glancing over his shoulder before every question in case someone\u2019s standing behind him now, listening. Bruce is happy to talk, happier still to not ask further questions about Bucky\u2019s sudden interest in medical conditions and advancements, but he mentions it to the rest of the team every time it happens, just in case it becomes relevant later. </p>\n<p>The problem is that Steve refuses to invade Bucky\u2019s privacy by hounding him about where he goes on those days he disappears and why he comes back full of questions about cancer and blood disorders. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does it have to be me anyway?\u201d Steve asks, arms crossed stubbornly over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause out of all of us, he\u2019s least likely to get mad and try to kill you,\u201d Clint says, rolling his eyes like the answer is obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is pretty funny, considering he\u2019s already gotten mad and tried to kill you,\u201d Tony says. Sam slaps him on the back of the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll this Stark money and you still can\u2019t buy tact,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, I\u2019m with Steve on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShocking,\u201d says Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Bruce says. </p>\n<p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d Tony says. Bruce makes a kissy face at him and waits for him to smile before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he was going to use medical knowledge to, I don\u2019t know, poison us all or infect us with some deadly disease,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cthen he wouldn\u2019t be asking about genetic conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he could give us all cancer,\u201d Clint says. \u201cWas that arm checked for radiation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, stop,\u201d Steve says, authority in his voice, and it\u2019s just like they\u2019re in the field: everyone goes quiet and stands at attention. \u201cI know that I\u2019ve got a Bucky-sized blind spot, but I\u2019m pretty sure I would have noticed almost a year\u2019s worth of evidence of his secret plans to poison us. He\u2019s not a killer, not anymore. He\u2019s one of us. We wouldn\u2019t have this conversation about Tony, or Bruce, or Sam, or Thor. We\u2019re not going to have it about Bucky.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI would have this conversation about Tony, Bruce, <i>and</i> Sam,\u201d Clint says. When everyone looks at him, he shrugs, says, \u201cI\u2019m only half-joking. That otherworldly brainwashing thing did a number on my sense of trust. But I get what you\u2019re saying, Cap. We\u2019ll lay off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would not assume misdeed on my part, Clint Barton?\u201d Thor asks, sincere curiosity all over.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, buddy,\u201d Clint says. \u201cNot you.\u201d He holds out his fist and grins when Thor bumps it with his own. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis has been a strange morning,\u201d Sam says, \u201cand that concerns me, because it\u2019s been a very normal morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can go for another run,\u201d Steve suggests, all innocent eyes and guileless smile, \u201cand I can kick your ass again. It\u2019ll be like a restart button.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, Steve.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve laughs all the way to the elevator.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an open press conference, and then a signing, and it\u2019s Bucky\u2019s first of both since officially joining the team. The others encourage him to speak up, let the public get to know him as an Avenger, but he doesn\u2019t want the public to know him as anything, so he stays quiet, utterly silent save for exactly three instances of laughter, two of which were at Tony\u2019s expense. The final question is from a little boy who holds a Bucky Bear in one hand and the microphone in the other when he asks, \u201cWill there be Bears of the other Avengers?\u201d </p>\n<p>Bucky decides to talk. </p>\n<p>He leans forward, smiles big, and says, \u201cNot officially, that I know, but Tony and I are working on getting a War Machine Bear made, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy\u2019s eyes go wide at the mention of a Rhodey Bear and it makes Bucky\u2019s face hurt, how hard he\u2019s smiling. The kid\u2019s father looks considerably less enthused, takes the mic from his son and asks, \u201cYou really think a <i>War Machine</i> Bear is appropriate for a child?\u201d </p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s face falls immediately, not into anger or hurt, just confusion, which is enough to make Steve and Natasha try to cut Bucky off before he can respond, but they\u2019re too late. \u201cI\u2019m a sniper turned assassin for HYDRA,\u201d he says, his voice like sandpaper amplified through the mic in front of him. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a year since I was deprogrammed. I\u2019m still regaining memories I lost, and I\u2019m fighting next to my best friend who I nearly killed eighteen months ago. I murdered Howard and Maria Stark. I started wars - not figuratively, literally, me, <i>I</i> started wars that killed millions of people. I\u2019m probably going to be in therapy for the rest of my life and the only reason I manage to go every week is because the Falcon drives me there and sits in the waiting room until my hour is up and drives me back. You think a Bucky Bear is more appropriate for your son than a teddy bear based on an Air Force Colonel who\u2019s saved countless lives, who saved <i>the President</i>, because his codename is a little militaristic?\u201d </p>\n<p>Tony starts clapping, and Thor pounds his hand on the table in support, and most of the audience begins to cheer, but Bucky still has confused, imploring eyes set on the father, now flustered and huffing. He turns to look at Steve, who\u2019s staring at him with a heartbroken look on his face, and Bucky doesn\u2019t know <i>why</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are they <i>clapping</i>?\u201d Bucky whispers. </p>\n<p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says quietly, puts his hand on Bucky\u2019s knee and squeezes, shakes his head, and it answers nothing, but it makes Bucky feel much farther away from tipping over the edge of panic any second. Bucky still has to go to the restroom and splash water on his face before the signing starts, press hard at his forehead with the metal hand until it stops feeling like his frontal lobe is going to explode from the sudden wash of guilt. He\u2019s so tired. He considers bailing, could easily exit the building without even being seen, will never ever forget how to be a ghost, but he pokes his head into the big conference room and sees a little dark-skinned girl in line, wearing an Avengers backpack and hugging a Bucky Bear close to her, and he chooses to stay. </p>\n<p>The adults seem uneasy about him now, in a way that they weren\u2019t during the press conference at first, which is fine with him because it means making less small talk than he\u2019d originally anticipated. People go from Natasha on his right directly to Steve on his left, and Steve keeps trying to send them back to him, keeps saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve skipped an Avenger!\u201d like he doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re doing it on purpose, and Bucky keeps twirling his pen around his fingers like a knife and saying, \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d and resolutely not taking his eyes off a spot on the ceiling directly above the emergency exit sign. The little girl hugging the Bucky Bear, though, shyly says, \u201cThank you, Black Widow,\u201d and then leaps in front of Bucky. He looks down and doesn\u2019t hesitate before meeting her big grin with his own. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey there, little lady,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty neat toy you\u2019ve got there.\u201d She hunches up her shoulders and hugs the Bear tighter, says nothing. Bucky ducks under the table and crawls out from under the heavy cloth covering it, sits cross-legged in front of the girl and gives her a kind smile. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d She nods and he notices that the Bear\u2019s silver arm is covered in stickers. \u201cYou\u2019re a good decorator,\u201d he says, pointing at a tiny cupcake below the red star. \u201cI\u2019m a little jealous of this Bucky, to be honest.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes go wide and she shoves the Bear into Bucky\u2019s hands, twists her bookbag around to unzip it, and pulls out a dozen sheets of stickers, each with a different theme. She hands them to him, taking the Bear back like a trade, and shoving her bookbag around again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got plenty more at home,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cYou can have all of those!\u201d Bucky stares down at little rainbows and goldfish and airplanes. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, looking back up at her and smiling. \u201cHelp me choose which one should go on first, then.\u201d She picks a yellow kitten, reaches out to hold his metal hand and turn his arm over, presses it carefully to his cold wrist. He runs his thumb over it slowly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTalliyah,\u201d the little girl says, and then, in a whisper, \u201cIs it true what you said? That you killed Iron Man\u2019s mom and dad?\u201d Bucky leans toward her and lowers his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201call of it is true. I wasn\u2019t who I am now when I did it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I did it.\u201d He frowns at the Bucky Bear under her arm. \u201cKind of makes him less cuddly, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talliyah shakes her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, earnest and loud, \u201cyou asked for help and you had friends on your side. My mommy\u2019s in rehab, and my aunt says she\u2019s brave and good because she had the courage to ask for help. She says it\u2019s the hardest thing you can do. You\u2019re getting better just like Mommy\u2019s getting better, and she\u2019s my hero and so are you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky clenches his jaw hard enough to give himself a headache, ignores the tears stinging suddenly at his eyes. He holds his arms open and asks, \u201cIs it okay if I hug you?\u201d Talliyah smiles and launches herself at him, throws her arms around his neck and squeezes so he can feel the Bucky Bear at the back of his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Bucky says when she lets go and moves away, \u201cbut you\u2019re <i>my</i> hero. Thank you for the stickers, Talliyah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Bucky!\u201d she says happily, bouncing as she steps over to get in line to meet Steve. \u201cI love you!\u201d Bucky smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too, Talliyah,\u201d he says, just loud enough for her to hear, and then realizes that Steve and Natasha are both leaning over the table to look at him, curious expressions on their faces. \u201cSit down, you two,\u201d Bucky says, waving his metal hand dismissively above his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve got stickers!\u201d A boy appears next to him suddenly, wearing a shirt that\u2019s all black except for one silver sleeve. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got stickers?\u201d the boy asks, eager and wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure do,\u201d Bucky says, brandishing twelve sheets of assorted stickers. \u201cYou wanna pick the next one that goes on?\u201d He turns his arm to show the kitten and the boy gasps, reaches out to hold the metal wrist, the silver contrasting with his brown skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool!\u201d he says, and picks a shiny purple airplane, smooths it out over a space above Bucky\u2019s elbow. Bucky beams at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at that!\u201d he says, holding out his arm proudly. \u201cYou picked a good one. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRico,\u201d the boy answers, and Bucky holds up his hand for a high five.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Rico,\u201d he says. \u201cI like your shirt.\u201d Rico grins. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad gave it to me the last time he was home on leave,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Army!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you looked like an Army brat,\u201d Bucky teases. \u201cWhat\u2019s he do in the Army?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Captain,\u201d Rico says. \u201cHe\u2019s got a team and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like you should be talking to our Captain over there,\u201d Bucky says, jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward where Steve is sitting, signing autographs and smiling for Instagram pictures. Rico shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do love Captain America,\u201d Rico says, \u201cbut my dad always says he\u2019d be nothing without his best friend overseas. He says the people who protect him from the sidelines should never be overlooked because they\u2019re the reason people like him and Captain America are still here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s right,\u201d Steve says loudly, leaning over the table again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even been Captain America without Bucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky doesn\u2019t look up at Steve. Instead, he leans closer to Rico and stage whispers, \u201cI paid him to say that.\u201d Rico laughs and Bucky grins again, and this time it\u2019s Rico who asks for a hug before he lines up for Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really got a way with these kids, Bucky,\u201d Steve says above him. </p>\n<p>\u201cSign your pictures, Stevie,\u201d Bucky says, and smiles at the little girl who approaches him now. She\u2019s carrying a Bucky Bear and wearing green sneakers that roar like the Hulk with each step. \u201cOh, I bet your teachers love those,\u201d he says to her, and two minutes later he\u2019s got a cupcake with pink frosting stuck at the top of his metal shoulder, another hug, and small crowd of children around him, most holding Bucky Bears, some wearing Winter Soldier shirts, all eager to decorate his arm. By the time the signing ends and the room is being cleared, parents are having to pull their kids away from him, and the shiny metal of his arm is hardly visible. </p>\n<p>\u201cNew look, Bucky?\u201d Tony asks, putting on his sunglasses as the Avengers finally exit. Bucky peels one of the few unused stickers off a nearly empty sheet and sticks a bunch of bananas to the right lens of Tony\u2019s sunglasses. Tony sighs dramatically. \u201cWhy do you hate me, Bucky?\u201d Bucky throws his head back and laughs.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Recovery has pushed Bucky dangerously off his game. It\u2019s before dawn and he\u2019s in the pitch dark of the kitchen on the main Avengers floor - Steve\u2019s fridge was out of eggs, and so was his own, and he didn\u2019t want to bother checking anyone else\u2019s - for a full twenty seconds and doesn\u2019t notice another person in the room until they say, \u201cHeard you\u2019ve been up to some tricks, Sergeant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky jumps, grabs a knife from his belt and throws it as he spins around, before he can register that the mystery guest is a friend and not an enemy. Rhodey\u2019s already moved, though, had probably darted away from the corner table as soon as he\u2019d spoken, Bucky realizes, and the blade ends up stuck in the wall, handle shivering ominously. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rhodey says, hands up in placating surrender, face sincere and guilty but not scared. Even with his heart thundering in his chest, Bucky appreciates that Rhodey\u2019s never been afraid of him. \u201cThat was my fault. Lights, JARVIS?\u201d Light floods the room, subdued enough for the painfully early hour but bright enough to scatter the darkest shadows. Bucky squeezes his eyes shut and counts to fifteen before opening them again. Rhodey\u2019s next to him now, cracking the eggs Bucky had retrieved into a pan and flipping on the stove. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you Air Force guys do it, huh?\u201d Bucky says, forcing out a chuckle. His voice still trembles. He used to have better control of this. \u201cSit in the dark like an owl, scare a fella fresh out of bed, and then cook him breakfast to apologize?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWho says this breakfast is for you?\u201d Rhodey says, but he grins anyway, shakes some pepper into the eggs he\u2019s scrambling, the way Bucky likes. \u201cYou never answered me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout the tricks I\u2019m allegedly up to?\u201d Bucky asks. He places his hands on the counter behind him, pushes up until he\u2019s sitting next to the burners, his heels kicking lightly at the cabinets below. \u201cLet me guess: Tony thinks I\u2019m going to put anthrax in his pillow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said something about infecting him with sickle cell anemia, actually,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cThen, when I explained in great detail why that was impossible, even for an ex-assassin, he moved on to brain cancer caused by radiation from that arm.\u201d He taps Bucky\u2019s metal elbow with the spatula. \u201cMostly I think he\u2019s just worried about you, with your disappearing acts, but paranoia is easier for Tony than concern for other people, so that\u2019s where he lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no radiation emitting from my arm,\u201d Bucky says. Rhodey sighs and turns off the stove.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Bucky. Plate.\u201d Bucky reaches behind him and pulls a plate from the cupboard, holds it out in front of him and watches Rhodey scrape the eggs onto it. Rhodey opens a drawer on the other side of the stove and hands Bucky a fork. He leans his hip against the counter, watches Bucky eat in silence for a few moments, and finally says, \u201cWhat <i>do</i> you do when you\u2019re gone all day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky says nothing, continues to eat. He chews slowly, stares straight ahead at the knife lodged in the wall, and when his plate is finally clean, he says, \u201cIf I show you, do you promise not to tell Tony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAssuming it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s putting you or the others in imminent danger,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cYou know I have no problem letting Tony sweat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky drops down off the counter, puts his plate in the sink, and says, \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d On his way out of the kitchen, he pulls the knife out of the wall and shoves it back in his belt, adds, \u201cThanks for breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cSo where\u2019d you drag Rhodey off to all day?\u201d Tony asks at dinner that night. \u201cAnd does it have anything to do with the stab wound in the wall behind you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky looks over his shoulder at the damage. He shrugs. \u201cEasy patch job,\u201d he says. \u201cSteve used to put holes in our walls worse than that and he wasn\u2019t even all bulky then.\u201d Steve puts his fork down in a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cI only punched the walls because you <i>moved</i>,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou packed a wallop even when you were scrawny and asthmatic, and unlike <i>you</i> ever did, I had the good sense to run away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were supposed to be teaching me how to <i>fight</i>,\u201d Steve says.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Bucky agrees. \u201cYou <i>still</i> hardly know how to duck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Grandpas. You\u2019re not sidestepping the subject again,\u201d Tony says, pointing his fork at Bucky. \u201cWhere\u2019d you take Rhodey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToy factory,\u201d Bucky answers easily. \u201cNeeded his approval for the Rhodey Bear prototype. He\u2019s pissed it was me who got it done and not you, by the way. Might not be your best friend anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Tony says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t planning to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to tell someone,\u201d Tony says. </p>\n<p>\u201cLeave him be, Tony,\u201d Thor says. \u201cIf the good sergeant wishes us to not know, then he is not required to share his secret with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Thor,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cSpar with me tonight?\u201d Thor smiles at him around a mouthful of spaghetti.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith great pleasure,\u201d Thor says. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you, Bruce?\u201d Bucky asks. Tony perks up again at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s the topic tonight? Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas?\u201d Tony says. </p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I was thinking we could revisit thalassemia,\u201d Bucky says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre we really just going to ignore the arm?\u201d Sam asks. He\u2019s been staring at Bucky\u2019s metal arm, covered in stickers again, for the better part of a half-hour. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Bucky says, stretching out his arm, eyes twinkling. \u201cRhodey did it. His artistic genius is clearly wasted in the Air Force.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Where</i> do you <i>go</i>?\u201d Clint says, loud and exasperated. Bucky tilts his head from side to side, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarvard Law School,\u201d he says in a high-pitched voice, and Steve and Thor laugh, because Natasha sat them down to watch Legally Blonde last week, and it took approximately sixteen minutes after the credits rolled to realize what a horrible mistake that had been. Tony groans. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Bucky,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you\u2019re literally my least favorite teammate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like it\u2019s hard?\u201d Bucky says, still smiling sweetly. Natasha sighs.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sam pokes at Bucky\u2019s metal arm in the waiting room. \u201cDude, what is up with these crappy little drawings?\u201d Bucky turns toward him with a glare, but it relaxes so fast Sam thinks he might have honestly imagined it this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust some doodling yesterday,\u201d he says. \u201cKinda hard to get a good angle when you\u2019re drawing on one arm with the other hand, you know.\u201d Sam makes a noncommittal sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cThought Steve was the artist,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Bucky says. He looks sad all of a sudden. \u201cIs he still? Does he sketch anymore?\u201d Something about the uncertainty in his voice breaks Sam\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that he lets anybody see,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIf even you haven\u2019t seen him, then he\u2019s not gonna let any of us catch him at it.\u201d Bucky looks up at him again with surprise in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019d let you see,\u201d he says. Sam doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. Bucky\u2019s rarely this open and unguarded. It\u2019s the therapist\u2019s office that does it, Sam thinks. \u201cI used to save up for weeks to buy him high-end pencils and paints,\u201d Bucky says. He smiles at the memory. \u201cHe hated it. Kept telling me to save my money for something important. As if there was anything more important to me than him. I\u2019d have gone hungry for months if it meant he\u2019d have things that made him happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought it would keep his mind off the war, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Sam asks knowingly. Bucky looks at the ground like he\u2019s ashamed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him I enlisted,\u201d he says quietly, and Sam knows he\u2019s getting access to a secret about Bucky Barnes that even Steve doesn\u2019t have. \u201cBecause what else could I tell him? He was killing himself trying to join up and get sent to Europe, and I was the lucky able-bodied bastard who got the draft letter.\u201d Bucky kicks at the carpet like a stubborn child. \u201cI\u2019d have done anything to keep him from going,\u201d he says, \u201cand when I got my orders, I thought, At least if I die, Stevie won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you died, and then Steve wanted to,\u201d Sam says. Bucky scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so stupid.\u201d They\u2019re silent for a few moments, and Sam pulls out his phone to do a Yelp search, and then, \u201cDo you think we could stop at an art supplies store on the way back?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAlready on it,\u201d Sam says, showing Bucky the results page. Bucky smiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s got you, Sam,\u201d Bucky says. Sam looks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Bucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s got <i>you</i>.\u201d The door to the personal office opens and a woman with a kind face peeks out and smiles at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re up to bat, Bucky,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cGonna hit a home run this time, Doc,\u201d Bucky says, standing and strutting his way across the room toward her office. \u201cMake the Dodgers so proud they\u2019ll move back home.\u201d She rolls her eyes good-naturedly and moves aside to let him into the room behind her. Just before she shuts the door, Sam could swear he sees a little plush bear head with a black eye mask poking out of Bucky\u2019s jacket pocket. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Bucky finds Steve lying on the couch, sketchpad perched on his chest, putting lazy pencil strokes across the page. </p>\n<p>\u201cDunno if Stark told you,\u201d he says, leaning over the back of the couch, raising an eyebrow at Steve, \u201cbut you got your own floor.\u201d Steve grunts, shrugs as much as he can in this position. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining,\u201d Bucky says. He grips the back of the couch with his metal hand and jumps over it. Steve brings his legs up just in time to avoid Bucky landing heavy on his shins, and Bucky rests his arm across Steve\u2019s knees. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you draw again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never really stopped,\u201d Steve admits, eyes focused on the paper in front of him. \u201cI just--stopped letting people see, fighting with the Commandos, and then.\u201d He pauses, lets the sketchpad fall back, looks up at Bucky\u2019s face. \u201cAfter I woke up, drawing what I saw\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look right,\u201d Bucky finishes. Steve nods, sighing. Bucky looks away from him, swallows. \u201cSometimes, I think I remember images of how the city looked in the decades you missed. They\u2019re not full memories, and maybe that\u2019s better, but--just snapshots of development and destruction. I\u2019m not sure if I want them to be real or not, \u2018cause if they\u2019re real, it means I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means you weren\u2019t--\u201d Steve tries, but Bucky gives him a sharp look and counters the interruption.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <i>means</i> I was here, and I was doing something terrible.\u201d Steve frowns. \u201cYou gotta let me deal with what I did, Stevie,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cJust \u2018cause I wasn\u2019t doing it by choice doesn\u2019t erase it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve says. It\u2019s a conversation they\u2019ve had before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He sits up, setting the sketchpad and pencil on the coffee table. \u201cHow are the nightmares?\u201d Bucky shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot as bad as they were at first, usually,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery once in awhile I still wake up standing with a knife in my hand, though, trying to fight to the death with random household objects. I\u2019ve lost more desk lamps that way.\u201d He smiles, and Steve knows it\u2019s okay to laugh, so he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed the fan mail is getting full of kids and their Bucky Bears again,\u201d Steve says. </p>\n<p>\u201cStickers, too,\u201d Bucky says. \u201c<i>So</i> many stickers. Parents are apparently sending vintage ones, too. I think I prefer old Lisa Frank to new Lisa Frank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Steve says, then, \u201cHey, let me decorate your arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe stickers are in my room,\u201d Bucky says with a groan, \u201cand I don\u2019t feel like movin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, \u2018cause I want to use that paint you got me,\u201d Steve says, groping blindly at the floor under the coffee table. He pulls up a canvas bag with a victorious raise of his fist, and retrieves brushes and acrylic paints from it. He drags the half-empty cup of water that\u2019s been on the table for days closer to him, dunks a brush into it, and scrutinizes his available paint colors. \u201cDon\u2019t move, jerk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry it up, then, punk,\u201d Bucky says.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony would say you can\u2019t rush genius,\u201d Steve says, finally settling on white. Bucky laughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust like Howard,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do in a past life to get landed with two generations of Starks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Steve says, holding Bucky by the elbow and painting the red star a vivid, clean white. \u201cBut clearly you were there, too, else you wouldn\u2019t be here with Tony and me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I was there,\u201d Bucky says, like he\u2019s offended Steve would suggest he wouldn\u2019t have been right next to him in their past lives, fucking up something big enough to get them punished with multiple rounds of Starks. \u201cCan\u2019t let you go anywhere alone, can I? You\u2019d just embarrass yourself, like when you walked in on me and Marlene that time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis again?\u201d Steve asks, eyes wide and mouth twisted up into an exasperated smile, still focused on painting. \u201cYou were with her in <i>my</i> bed! What was I supposed to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were <i>s\u2019posed</i> to notice the tie on the doorknob, hear the noises she was making, and go to my room until we were done, <i>like a normal person would</i>,\u201d Bucky says. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause <i>a normal person</i> runs into their best friend and their dame of the week in his own bed so often, I guess, right?\u201d Steve switches the brush with white paint on it for a clean one, dips it in the blue, and starts outlining Bucky\u2019s now white star.</p>\n<p>\u201cI went with Marlene for <i>two</i> weeks, thank you very much,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cHad to take her to dinner four times to get her into bed with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re exaggerating her enjoyment, by the way,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI distinctly remember not hearing any noises from her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably \u2018cause she was strictly into dames herself,\u201d Bucky says thoughtfully, and Steve stills the brush in his hand, looks up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d he asks. Bucky nods. \u201cMarlene?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShe told me when she dumped me a few days later,\u201d Bucky says. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Steve says, goes back to painting. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that she felt comfortable enough to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Bucky shrugs with his right shoulder only. \u201cApparently it was obvious how I felt about you, so I guess it made her feel like she could trust me with it. Plus, she thought you walking in on us was a sign that you and me should be together. She was so earnest about it, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her we sorta already were.\u201d Steve laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe kind of always were, weren\u2019t we?\u201d Bucky turns his head to look at Steve, takes in the look of concentration on Steve\u2019s face, all that Steve Rogers attention focused solely on beautifying the horror of Bucky\u2019s metal arm, and feels like he\u2019s ten years old again, stupid in love with his best friend and not even knowing what that meant.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAlways were, always will be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Til the end of the line,\u201d Steve murmurs, using his thumb to rub away a stray stroke of blue paint. Bucky closes his eyes and lets his head fall to rest on the back of the couch. He wakes up two hours later with Steve curled up on the couch next to him, his feet tucked in between Bucky\u2019s back and the sofa, like he\u2019d been trying to make himself small again. </p>\n<p>Bucky looks down at his arm and sees a white star on blue, outlined by red, glances at the table to see three brushes resting in the glass of murky water. He gets up carefully, slowly, and grabs the blanket from the chair across the room. As he throws it over Steve, his eyes catch the sketch he\u2019d interrupted earlier: Bucky holding a Bucky Bear, one of the new ones, pinching at the left arm, and smiling proudly. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>In a mid-afternoon battle in Queens, Maximillian Zaran aims a spear at a child on her way home from school, and Bucky breaks. Sam kicks the gun out of the guy\u2019s hands, turns in the air to kick him in the face, but the Winter Soldier is already there, pinning him to the ground like he\u2019s nothing. With his knees on Zaran\u2019s chest, the Winter Soldier slashes with a knife at Zaran\u2019s arms, across Zaran\u2019s exposed throat, before tossing the knife away and punching, cruel and relentless, with his left hand. It takes both Thor and the Hulk to pull him back, and he\u2019s still thrashing and gritting his teeth the whole way. The Hulk holds him in a hug, says, \u201cSOLDIER. CALM,\u201d and after a full minute, he finally relaxes, and the Hulk drops him as gently as possible onto the street. Bucky\u2019s face down and coughing, shaking, and when he finally manages to push onto his arms and look up, the team is staring down at him, fear and concern in their eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs the girl okay?\u201d Bucky asks, scrambling to his feet, dizzy and ignoring it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt her, did he? He was going to--\u201d He sees her then, a little girl in a bright blue dress, stopped still on the sidewalk two blocks ahead, staring at the scene before her. He smiles at her, waves, and Tony jumps in front of him, faceplate raised, looking wild-eyed and angry. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking smile and wave at a little kid with blood all over your face, Patrick Bateman!\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?!\u201d Bucky steps back, blinking in surprise, and wipes at his face, spits out the blood he suddenly realizes has splattered in his mouth. He looks down at Zaran, sees less of a face and more blood-soaked hair and asphalt, teeth and flesh and skull fragments drowning in it. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe was--\u201d Bucky starts, breathing heavy and quick, heartbeat in overdrive like it hasn\u2019t been in months. \u201cHe was gonna kill her. He was going to kill a child. I just--\u201d He catches sight of his metal arm, his punching hand, widens his eyes at the blood, thick like paint on his knuckles, sprayed all the way up to match the star on his shoulder. There\u2019s a tooth jammed between two fingers, cartilage strewn across where fingernails should be. His knees buckle, and Sam and Steve are there on either side of him just as the panic attack really starts. \u201cI did it,\u201d he says to Sam, uncontrollable tears falling. \u201cI--I killed him, I was the weapon, Winter Soldier, I did it--\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam presses his palm to the back of Bucky\u2019s neck, looks him in the eyes, says, \u201cNo, Bucky, listen to me. Today you were Bucky. He wasn\u2019t a mark and you weren\u2019t an assassin. He was a <i>bad guy</i>, Bucky, and <i>you</i> made the choice. You weren\u2019t under orders; you didn\u2019t hurt anyone innocent. You <i>saved</i> someone, Bucky. You saved a <i>kid</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe was going to--\u201d Bucky says, turning his head toward Steve on his left side, but Sam puts his hand on Bucky\u2019s bloody face, directs Bucky to look back at him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s got you,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSteve\u2019s here, he\u2019s cleaning up your arm, okay, Bucky? I need you to focus, though. I need you to pay attention to my breathing and then do like I do.\u201d He guides Bucky through it, the slow and deliberate inhale and exhale, and after a minute or two Bucky\u2019s not even shaking on the exhale that much, and he lets the hand that was resting on Bucky\u2019s cheek drop to hold Bucky\u2019s right wrist again. Bucky looks to his left again, sees Steve sitting cross-legged next to him, bare-chested with a bundle of blue material stained with red tossed over his shoulder, and Bucky realizes that Steve used his own shirt to clean the blood off Bucky\u2019s arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d he says, horrified, but Steve slips his fingers between Bucky\u2019s metal ones and smiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, Bucky?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou with us? With me?\u201d Bucky swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Til the end of the line, pal,\u201d he says, and Steve nods, stands and pulls Bucky up with him. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Two days later, Bruce pulls back the sheets on his bed to find a Bucky Bear and a Hulk Bear. The Hulk Bear is wearing little purple shorts and is hugging the Bucky Bear. Under them is a note that reads, \u201cSOLDIER THANKS.\u201d He laughs at that, and sets the bears on the pillow next to his head.</p>\n<p>The rest of the team finds Bear versions of themselves in their living quarters over the course of the following week. The Black Widow Bear wears a necklace with an arrow on it; Natasha stares at it for fifteen minutes before she places it gingerly on the table next to her bed. When Sam squeezes the Falcon Bear, wings pop out of the back of its shirt, and he\u2019s never felt so delighted. The Iron Bear\u2019s faceplate opens to reveal a goatee, and when Tony peels back the suit, there are threads crisscrossing, forming scars, like it got an arc reactor removed, too. Clint finds the Hawkeye Bear perched on top of the entertainment center in his living room while he\u2019s doing a routine sweep for unauthorized surveillance, pulls a tiny arrow from the quiver on the Bear\u2019s back, and cackles when he actually manages to fire it with the bow in the Bear\u2019s hand. The Thor Bear holds a miniature Mjolnir, and Thor brings it to bed and shows it to Jane with unbridled excitement, even though Jane\u2019s still half-asleep. Steve gets out of the shower to find the Captain America Bear on the counter next to the sink, holding its little shield above its head like an umbrella for the steam. </p>\n<p>Tony gets a text from Rhodey on a Wednesday night: a picture of a Rhodey Bear in a little Air Force uniform and a War Machine Bear in the suit\u2019s original design, with the caption, <i>Thought u were only kidding!!</i> Tony stares at the picture the entire way to Bucky\u2019s floor, and when he gets there, he finds Bucky sitting on the kitchen tile, Stark Industries-issued laptop balanced on his knees, watching YouTube videos of baby sloths. Tony has a million questions, like he\u2019s always had for Bucky, like, <i>Why are you sitting on the kitchen floor? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you really were having Bears made for Rhodey? What is it with you and kids? What did you think of my father? Where do you go on the days you disappear? Did you think we\u2019d stop noticing just because you got us Bears? That\u2019s not really where you\u2019ve been going, is it, to get those manufactured? It can\u2019t be, because you\u2019re still leaving, right? Why sloths? Have you ever even slept in your bed or have you just been crawling into Steve\u2019s every night since you moved in?</i> </p>\n<p>He forgoes all of them in favor of sitting down next to Bucky and saying, \u201cYou could\u2019ve just talked to us, you know. We\u2019re your team.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou're Steve\u2019s team,\u201d Bucky says, his eyes never leaving the screen. Tony doesn\u2019t blame him. Turns out baby sloths are seriously adorable. \u201cI\u2019m the scary eighth wheel.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever heard of a seven-wheeler being anything but terrifying and unsafe?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t, because a seven-wheeled vehicle would just be very terrifying and extremely unsafe. You need the eighth wheel. <i>We</i> need the eighth wheel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need the eighth wheel to be sane if you\u2019re gonna be safe,\u201d Bucky says, and Tony starts laughing because he just can\u2019t help it. Bucky looks at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cBucky, I\u2019ve got news for you: the other seven wheels aren\u2019t exactly a secure package of sanity either,\u201d he says. \u201cNatasha has more secrets than hair follicles on her entire body, Clint grew up in a fucking <i>circus</i>, Bruce has a literal monster of anger inside of him that he can actually <i>control</i>, how is <i>that</i> not scary, Thor\u2019s daddy issues intimidate the hell out of <i>my</i> daddy issues, Steve was like - listen, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s told you, so if he hasn\u2019t, don\u2019t tell him I did - but he was really fucking depressed before you popped back up, I was getting calls from Natasha every week just worried as fuck about him, even if she didn\u2019t use the word \u2018worry,\u2019 and I fought one battle with all these weirdos and immediately started building them their own separate floors here, and I thought that was a normal reaction until Pepper looked at me with <i>pity</i> in her eyes, and then I was like, Wow, I really need friends. Sam\u2019s the only one who came to this game put together, but that\u2019s because he was put through the ringer already and got out the other side. Are those sloths hanging out to dry?\u201d </p>\n<p>Bucky blinks, glances at the screen. \u201cYeah, they got a bath and now they\u2019re drying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Tony says. \u201c<i>Fuck</i>, that\u2019s the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. But hey, so my point is, we\u2019re all getting better, right? Natasha\u2019s opening up more, Steve\u2019s a lot happier, Bruce has made peace with the Green Guy, Clint only checks for bugs once a week now instead of twice a day, Thor\u2019s here because he likes us more than he\u2019s angry at his family, I\u2019m not the loneliest boy in New York anymore, Sam\u2019s got a team again, I know that means a lot to him, and you--\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Bucky agrees. Tony shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? You\u2019re getting better, Bucky,\u201d he says. Bucky shakes his head, looks away from Tony, away from the computer screen. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m mean to you because I don\u2019t deserve you to be nice to me,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cOr whatever your equivalent of nice is. You shouldn\u2019t even want me on this team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cBecause you killed my parents? When you were under some Nazi mind control?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were still just a kid--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and it sucked,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIt\u2019s in my top three worst things that have ever happened to me, and I have had a considerable amount of terrible things happen to me, and when I first found out that the guy Steve was chasing murdered my parents - yeah, I was pissed. I took a sledgehammer to his floor. I had to remodel everything, so that was pretty stupid in hindsight, but honestly? Bucky, I spent decades thinking I was crazy for suspecting that their death hadn\u2019t been an accident, and then years after that thinking my dad\u2019s best friend had them killed for control of the company, and of me, and just - knowing that my parents had HYDRA so damn nervous that they sent their best master assassin to get them out of the way of HYDRA\u2019S dream world? It\u2019s actually - it\u2019s helped. I know that\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s true, and I want you on this team, and it\u2019s not because you used to be a weapon. I don\u2019t just want you fighting next to me, okay? I want to fight next to <i>you</i>, because I know you never got into any fights that weren\u2019t ones your best friend had started, and you\u2019ve had your life stolen from you again and again and again since 1942, and you\u2019re still here, you never gave up, you\u2019ve never stopped fighting. I know what it\u2019s like to be the friend who starts the fights, and Rhodey never let me lose one, he never stopped looking for me, he never gave up.\u201d Bucky\u2019s looking at him now, and Tony sighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cLast week when you went to town on that Zaran guy,\u201d Tony says, voice low, \u201cI wasn\u2019t <i>mad</i> at you, I wasn\u2019t scared of you. I was scared <i>for</i> you, because I thought it meant something happened to the progress you\u2019ve been making, I thought we - I thought Steve was losing you again, I thought you were losing <i>yourself</i> again. I wasn\u2019t fucking mad at you for killing a guy who was going to kill a kid - are you kidding? That was like, my first day as Iron Man. None of us were worried you were going to kill us in our sleep, Bucky. We were worried for you, and if you\u2019d just talked to us instead of creeping around our living quarters leaving personalized gifts like a fucking Criminal Minds episode, then you\u2019d know that, but I guess you also wouldn\u2019t be moping in your kitchen watching baby sloths, so, you know, maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s silent for a few moments, and then says, \u201cBut you like the Iron Bear, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIron Bear is my new lab mascot, I like it so much,\u201d Tony says. \u201cHey, where do you go when you disappear all day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice try, Tony,\u201d Bucky says, turning back to his laptop in time to watch a shaved baby sloth get smeared with sulfur and lard. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Tony asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe had mange,\u201d Bucky explains. \u201cSee, now they\u2019re swaddling him so he doesn\u2019t lick it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI\u2019m so mad about how cute that is.\u201d He stands up, says, \u201cEmail all these sloth videos to me. I\u2019m making everybody watch them. Team meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Bucky says, and, just before Tony leaves the room, \u201cTony?\u201d Tony turns back, looks like he expected this, and Bucky runs his hand through his hair. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, \u201cfor, you know. Just - thanks.\u201d Tony nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d he says, and Bucky knows he means it. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Steve is sweaty and shivering under a thin, scratchy blanket, tired and achey. Bucky\u2019s curled around him, an omnipresent protective force, and Steve\u2019s coughing has shaken Bucky awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky murmurs, his arm heavy over Steve\u2019s chest. \u201cStevie, shh, lemme get you some water.\u201d He starts to crawl out from under the blanket, but Steve grabs his hand, holds it with all the strength he can muster.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease stay, Bucky,\u201d he rasps. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing keeping me here.\u201d Bucky settles over him again immediately, pressing soft kisses to the back of his clammy neck, humming sweet little sounds into his thin skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky whispers. Steve shifts back against Bucky\u2019s body, swallows past a raw and burning throat. \u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky repeats, and Steve grunts an underwhelming response. Bucky\u2019s hand comes to rest on Steve\u2019s arm and, after a second, squeezes; it\u2019s cold and unyielding. \u201cStevie,\u201d he says, and Steve opens his eyes to Bucky standing over him, fully dressed, metal hand curved protectively over Steve\u2019s bicep. \u201cStevie?\u201d Bucky says, and then, \u201cYou sleep like the dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter seventy years, it\u2019s a habit,\u201d Steve says with a small smile, their usual morning joke. He blinks the dream out of his vision, squints past Bucky at the angry red numbers of the clock on the shelf and groans. \u201cBuck, it\u2019s not even five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou always get up before dawn,\u201d Bucky says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is <i>before</i> before dawn,\u201d Steve whines. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 awake anyways?\u201d He rolls over, stubbornly pulling the comforter up to his neck as he goes. \u201cCome back to bed, Bucky.\u201d There\u2019s silence for a few moments, and then--</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna know where I go when I\u2019m gone all day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolls over to look at Bucky again. \u201cReally?\u201d he asks, heart pounding fast. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna take me with you?\u201d Bucky grins, and it\u2019s blinding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re on a schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve decides to take his wardrobe cues from Bucky, like he did every day for the first few months after Bucky moved in. Bucky\u2019s wearing tight dark jeans and a Black Widow t-shirt under one of Steve\u2019s plaid button-downs, open and casual, because even through decades of brainwashing and memory loss Bucky could still never shake his effortless coolness, so Steve pulls on jeans and a t-shirt too - Hawkeye, because he\u2019s feeling sentimental and sarcastic - and sits to put on the loose-fitting sneakers that Sam\u2019s still trying to get him to call \u201ckicks.\u201d Bucky stands patiently at his left, and Steve glances at Bucky\u2019s boots to see that the laces are red, white, and blue. \u201cWhen\u2019d you swap those out?\u201d he asks, tugging lightly at a loop, recalling months of fighting next to Bucky\u2019s bloodstained black laces, and Bucky only shrugs.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just after five by the time they step outside, and Bucky leads the way to a coffee shop on 7th. He pauses before opening the door, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not Starbucks, but they\u2019re not open this early, and Gregory\u2019s has better pastries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink most New Yorkers would be glad it\u2019s not Starbucks,\u201d Steve says as he walks in.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink most New Yorkers are pretentious assholes.\u201d Steve can\u2019t exactly argue with that, despite the amusement he\u2019s gotten from Bucky discovering an unbridled love for overpriced chain coffee. Still, Steve doesn\u2019t miss the delight on Bucky\u2019s face at the two young men behind the counter greeting him by name. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe usual, Bucky?\u201d the one at the register asks. His arms are covered in tattoos and his bottom lip is pierced. Steve can\u2019t stop staring at it. </p>\n<p>\u201cDouble it,\u201d Bucky says, gesturing at Steve behind him. Two lattes and two chocolate croissants in hand and two twenties placed in the tip jar later, and Steve and Bucky are back outside. Steve takes a bite of his chocolate croissant and swears loudly in appreciation. \u201cExactly,\u201d Bucky agrees, and stuffs the entire thing in his mouth at once. Steve follows him onto a bus where he watches Bucky talk to the driver like they\u2019re old friends, and maybe they are, Steve realizes, when Bucky\u2019s asking how the driver\u2019s grandson\u2019s Little League game went last week. They get off after twenty-five minutes, Bucky waves a goodbye to the driver, tells him that the Winter Soldier is rooting for West Side, and leads Steve down 120th. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarlem?\u201d Steve asks, looking around, smiling politely when the few people on the street at this hour wave to him and Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot the name of the place from Sam,\u201d Bucky says, tossing his coffee cup into a trash can. Steve follows suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat place?\u201d Steve says, and then, \u201cWait, has Sam known what you do and he hasn\u2019t told me?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cHe just mentioned the shop once.\u201d He gives Steve a significant look. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t tell you everything about me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat shop?\u201d Steve asks again, but then Bucky stops so abruptly that Steve just barely manages to not crash into him. Bucky raises an eyebrow at Steve and looks up. Steve follows his gaze to take in a brown storefront and a name written in blue and black lettering on yellow and red, Grandma\u2019s Place. He looks through the glass of the storefront, into the dark of the shop, at the yellow sign indicating that the store is closed. \u201cUh, Bucky--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019, Sarge,\u201d says a woman with short gray hair and a friendly face approaching them. Bucky grins at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of rushin\u2019 you, darlin\u2019,\u201d he says, moving out of the way for her to unlock the door. </p>\n<p>\u201cShould still be dreaming,\u201d she says, and Bucky holds the door open while she enters the shop and turns on the lights, disappears into the back room. Steve stands next to Bucky inside the store and stares in awe at the dolls surrounding him, in all different shades of dark and light skin and varied hairstyles, at books with children of color on the covers, at toys made for autistic kids. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis place is amazing,\u201d he whispers to Bucky. \u201cIs this where you got those Avengers Bears made?\u201d Bucky nods, and the woman reappears from the back of the store pushing a dolly loaded with two large boxes. </p>\n<p>\u201cHere you go, Sarge,\u201d she says, handing him a clipboard and a pen. He signs for the order and hands them back to her, leans down to pick up one of the boxes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an absolute angel,\u201d Bucky says with a smile, while Steve grabs the second box. \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t take a tip? It\u2019s really the least I can do for making you get up this early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything for those kids,\u201d she says, ushering them out so she can close the shop again. \u201cBut you can take me out to dinner like you promised.\u201d Bucky laughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll double date with Iron Man and Pepper Potts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThor and that Dr. Foster girl look like they\u2019d be more entertaining,\u201d she says, locking up. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you want, dear,\u201d Bucky says, bending down to kiss her on the cheek. \u201cSee you next week.\u201d She waves a farewell and Bucky and Steve set off again. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the boxes?\u201d Steve asks, hoisting his up on his shoulder. \u201cAnd what kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking lots of questions, Stevie,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cJust be patient.\u201d Steve sighs, rolls his eyes, but Bucky reaches out to hold Steve\u2019s left hand, and Steve decides to try patience.</p>\n<p>They sit next to each other on the A train, boxes in the empty seats on either side of them. Bucky hooks his ankle around Steve\u2019s and Steve traces little stars and hearts on Bucky\u2019s palm with his fingers. No one gives them a second look. Steve turns his head, catches Bucky\u2019s eyes, rests his forehead against Bucky\u2019s, and says quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s kinda nice, isn\u2019t it? That it doesn\u2019t matter who sees, no matter where we are.\u201d He pauses, frowns, and, thinking of the weird Avengers publicity, amends, \u201cWell, I guess it does matter, a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Bucky says firmly, instantaneous, and Steve presses a grateful kiss to his mouth, his jaw, down to his neck. Bucky smiles, squirms away, and Steve feels a triumphant little thrill at the sight of Bucky\u2019s face tinted pink. \u201c<i>Does</i> matter if you make me miss our stop, though,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes, and Steve laughs and squeezes his hand. It\u2019s past seven when they get off at the sixth stop, and Steve manages to keep quiet as they walk, even as he follows Bucky into the children\u2019s hospital. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, ladies,\u201d Bucky says, approaching the welcome desk in the lobby. He sets his box on the floor by his feet and, like a dial being suddenly pushed to its maximum, turns up his charm. Steve can practically see the girls Bucky used to date in the faces of the middle-aged women behind the desk, flattered and flushed and falling all over themselves to greet him. Steve wants to laugh, but not as much as he wants to see this unedited, this world Bucky\u2019s whittled down for himself when no one else was looking, where he\u2019s charming and happy and full of purpose again. It\u2019s the closest Bucky\u2019s come to being the Bucky Steve knew before the war, or even during it, in eighteen months. </p>\n<p>\u201cI brought a friend with me today,\u201d Bucky\u2019s saying, jerking his thumb toward Steve. \u201cI know you lovelies are usually so thorough with your background checks for volunteers, but we can make an exception just this once for Captain America, right?\u201d He fixes a lazy, smug look on his face, the kind of smirk that reaches past his eyes, the exact expression that used to have dames lining up around the block for him, that he only ever used on Steve when he really wanted something. The women at the desk are eager to please, too, and hand over a badge to Steve that says VOLUNTEER in big black letters. Steve doesn\u2019t notice that the badge they give Bucky says BUCKY BARNES until they get to the elevator. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d <i>you</i> pass the background check?\u201d he asks once they\u2019re inside, and Bucky turns the smirk on him, all the evidence that\u2019s needed. Steve nods, swallows, fidgets with his jeans. \u201cGot it.\u201d Bucky laughs at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet yourself together, Steve,\u201d he hisses, teasing. \u201cWe\u2019re in a children\u2019s hospital, you dirty old man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJerk,\u201d Steve grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wish?\u201d Bucky says, and the doors open to the fifth floor, and Bucky leads Steve to the Infectious Diseases Unit. The nurse standing at the desk, with a headscarf and a beautiful face, stops looking through papers on a clipboard and smiles at Bucky, clearly happy to see him. \u201cAssalamu alaikum, Yalda,\u201d Bucky says to her, and Yalda\u2019s eyes light up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better than last time,\u201d she says. \u201cAlaikum assalam, Bucky, Captain Rogers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust \u2018Steve,\u2019 please,\u201d Steve says, reaching his hand out to shake hers and then jerking it back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry - I know this, should\u2019ve waited for you to initiate that.\u201d She looks impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you found him in an alley?\u201d she asks Bucky. </p>\n<p>\u201cOver and over again,\u201d Bucky says, picking up the clipboard from the counter and scanning the paper on it. \u201cGetting punched in the stupid face every time. Did Marcus finally get discharged?\u201d The amused look on Yalda\u2019s face falls. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, quiet and sad. \u201cHe passed away last week.\u201d Bucky looks up at her, stricken.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says. \u201cBut--he was doing so much better a month ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how it can go by now,\u201d she says, not unkindly. \u201cSometimes it gets better before it gets worse, and then sometimes, it stops getting better.\u201d She takes in Bucky\u2019s sad face, says, \u201cYou should know - we lost Rianne, too, a week and a half ago, and Damien the week before that. It\u2019s been gloomy around here since your last visit. The kids could really use you.\u201d She takes the clipboard from him. \u201cI\u2019ve got rounds to finish. You two can help with breakfast. It was nice to meet you, Steve. No food fights this time, Bucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNina started it!\u201d Bucky says, but Yalda\u2019s on her way down the hall, waving dismissively behind her. Bucky turns to Steve. \u201cC\u2019mon. We can put the boxes in the Child Life Center and then pass out breakfast. You\u2019ll get to meet the kids individually before the real fun starts, it\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReal fun?\u201d Steve asks, but he follows Bucky anyway, and in twenty minutes they\u2019ve been given responsibility for a cart loaded with trays of hospital breakfast food. \u201cCan you believe hospital food nowadays?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much better,\u201d Bucky agrees. \u201cNobody around here believes me when I tell them that the food used to be worse. No respect for their elders.\u201d He knocks lightly on a door before opening it, pushing the cart inside. \u201cHey, Jonas!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBucky!\u201d The boy - he can\u2019t be older than eight, and his bare head and bony arms make something distant ache inside Steve\u2019s chest - sits up in bed instantly at Bucky\u2019s greeting, smiles like he\u2019s not in a hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing in the Infectious Diseases Unit, buddy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPneumonia,\u201d Jonas says with an exaggerated frown, rolling his eyes. \u201cChemo messed up my immune system.\u201d He takes the tray Bucky hands to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve here knows a thing or two about pneumonia,\u201d Bucky says, and Jonas finally notices Steve, his eyes going wide and his jaw dropping open. \u201cHe used to get it every winter, sometimes twice. Huh, Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh-uh,\u201d Jonas says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Steve says with a shrug. </p>\n<p>\u201cI told you he was sick all the time,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cHe looked different then, though. He was all skin and bones, like you. And you know what? He still made it through every time.\u201d Bucky pats Jonas\u2019 knee through the blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be fine, Jonas.\u201d Jonas smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Bucky,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you both gonna be in the Center today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cGot a surprise for you, too, so you\u2019d better eat your breakfast if you don\u2019t wanna miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The remainder of breakfast goes the same way. Most of the kids already know Bucky, and the few who haven\u2019t met him yet have heard about him from the others, almost cry when they do meet him, like they\u2019d been thinking all the stories were just collective fever dreams. None of them ever once refer to Steve as Captain America, but he can tell that it\u2019s not for lack of recognition; they know him, instead, as simply Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it true you punched Hitler over two hundred times?\u201d an eleven-year-old girl with endocarditis asks him. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it true you never ran away from a fight?\u201d a five-year-old tuberculosis patient asks him. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it true Bucky saved your life?\u201d a nine-year-old boy in for multiple bone infections asks him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sort of,\u201d he says, and, \u201cYes,\u201d and, \u201cMultiple times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then he saved mine,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cEven after I almost killed him. He spent months trying to find me, and another month convincing me that I was more than what I\u2019d been, until I finally came back to New York with him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve keeps preparing for a simplified story, pretty lies and less gruesome metaphors, but Bucky never once veers from the truth. A little girl he\u2019s never met before - admitted two weeks ago and diagnosed with HIV that no one understands why she has - tells him she\u2019s read in magazines and heard on radio talk shows that he\u2019s a killer. Bucky owns up to it immediately, explains the brainwashing and HYDRA in age-appropriate detail, says, \u201cBut you know, even before that, I was a sniper in the Army, and I killed people then, too, and now, I\u2019m an Avenger, and sometimes I kill people still.\u201d The girls\u2019 shoulders slump, like she\u2019d been hoping it wasn\u2019t true. Bucky gives her an understanding smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about it, honestly,\u201d he says, \u201cbut everybody has choices, every day, and sometimes they feel impossible. Some days I wake up and I don\u2019t want to go to therapy, or out to save the world, or get out of bed, or keep living. Do you ever feel like that?\u201d The girl nods slowly, and doesn\u2019t flinch when Bucky puts his metal hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel like that. The toughest thing about healing is choosing to do it every single day,\u201d he tells her. \u201cBut I promise you, Olivia, I <i>promise you</i> that it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says when they leave Olivia\u2019s room. \u201cYou never told me you felt like that.\u201d Bucky shrugs, doesn\u2019t meet Steve\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I need to talk about. These kids, though, they need to hear it sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says again, but Bucky\u2019s already going into another room, tray in hand.</p>\n<p>After returning the empty cart to the kitchen, Steve follows Bucky into the Child Life Center again, and Bucky says, \u201cTime to unpack!\u201d He pulls a knife from his belt and cuts the tape on both boxes, swift as he is in battle, and Steve finally opens the box he carried all over Manhattan. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you--\u201d he says, gingerly removing a small plush doll from the box, like the ones back at Grandma\u2019s Place, except that it looks exactly like the girl who asked him about Hitler: brown skin and dark eyes, black hair in a ponytail behind her head. He stares down at the doll, slackjawed. </p>\n<p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d Bucky asks, and Steve glances over to see that Bucky\u2019s box is full of Bucky Bears. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou had these made,\u201d Steve says, picking out doll after doll, cute plush replicas of most of the children they just served breakfast. \u201cYou had these custom made for each kid here.\u201d Bucky frowns, takes one of the dolls from Steve\u2019s hands. He peers into the box in front of Steve and removes two more. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was too late with these,\u201d he says quietly, rubbing his thumbs over the dolls\u2019 faces. He tucks one into each of his jacket pockets, the third into a back pocket of his jeans. Steve wants to ask so many questions, but a boy in a wheelchair - David, Steve remembers, four months here, bacterial infection in a wound on his thigh that keeps coming back worse than before - enters the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI ate my breakfast!\u201d he says excitedly. Bucky smiles at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re here for your surprise then, huh?\u201d he asks. David nods, spins around in the chair a few times, giggling. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can wait, though,\u201d David says. \u201cBucky likes to wait for all of us to get here,\u201d he explains to Steve, sounding very proud to know Bucky\u2019s routine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very egalitarian of him,\u201d Steve says, and Bucky rolls his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, David, you wanna race Captain America?\u201d he asks, which is how Steve finds himself running laps at full speed around the Center. Bucky is pushing David, not holding back at all, and David is laughing, arms up in the air, shrieking as he and Bucky manage to beat Steve in the final lap. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve says, breathing a bit hard, hands on his knees. \u201cNot bad.\u201d Bucky and David bump fists with matching grins.</p>\n<p>More children begin joining the three of them in the Center, and by nine, the Center is full of sick kids, their families, a few nurses, and Bucky and Steve. Bucky and Steve pass out the custom dolls to their human counterparts, and Bucky Bears to the new kids and their siblings. Jonas stares at his doll - Bucky had owed it to him, had been planning on swinging by the Cancer Unit to give it to him before they left - for so long that Steve begins to think that something\u2019s wrong with it, but when he bends down and asks, Jonas wipes at his eyes and says, \u201cHe\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve thinks of the way Bucky called his new Bucky Bear \u201che\u201d instead of \u201cit,\u201d tries to think of what Bucky would have said to him if he had ever gotten sick the way Jonas is sick, and says, \u201cYeah, he is, and so are you, Jonas.\u201d Jonas looks at him with shining, watery eyes, and Steve puts his hand around Jonas\u2019 tiny wrist, the way Bucky used to touch him when he was on bedrest for weeks at a time, and he hopes that Jonas finds it just as comforting as he did. </p>\n<p>One of the kids - Harper, ten years old, osteomyelitis - challenges Bucky to a few rounds of Mario Kart. Steve\u2019s never seen Bucky play any of the video games at the Tower, and Bucky\u2019s usually the first to get bored and leave the room when Tony and Clint pull out the controllers, but he\u2019s apparently widely known as something of a Mario Kart champion at the hospital. Harper recruits her younger sister and Olivia to play the other two cars, and most of the other children gather around as spectators, many rooting for Harper and Olivia as hospital representatives, but some of them - including Jonas, Steve notes - cheer loudly for Bucky. Steve sits down on the floor just outside the circle of kids, figuring he\u2019s as good at corralling as anyone, if he needs to, and notices the boy sitting next to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and the boy looks at him shyly. \u201cYou\u2019re the kid from the Smithsonian, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The boy smiles and nods, happy to be recognized. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrady,\u201d the boy says. \u201cI was on a family vacation. Nobody believed me when I told them after that you were there.\u201d Steve smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thank you for keeping my secret,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you live here in New York, huh? Do you mind if I ask what brings you to the hospital?\u201d</p>\n<p>Brady looks down at the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister,\u201d he says miserably, and points to a small girl in the crowd ahead, wearing a pink and purple wig, cheering for Harper. \u201cShe\u2019s got cancer, only not right now. When it\u2019s in remission, she gets infections, which is why we\u2019re here this time, but then she gets better, and it just comes back.\u201d He looks up at Steve with sad eyes and a clenched jaw. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever <i>really</i> get better.\u201d Steve reaches out and touches Brady\u2019s elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it feels that way,\u201d he says, thinking of how Bucky must have felt as they grew up together, Steve in and out of hospitals, doctor\u2019s offices, sickbeds, never knowing if the next hit would be the fatal one. \u201cI bet she feels like that sometimes, too. I bet sometimes she feels like it\u2019s not worth fighting. But you know what even a little bit of helps a whole lot?\u201d Brady shakes his head. \u201cHope,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI know it feels hopeless, but you\u2019ve gotta show her that you believe in her. Sometimes people you love having hope for you, believing you can do something - that\u2019s what makes it worth the fight. You think you can do that for your sister?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Brady says, and Steve smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can just call me \u2018Steve,\u2019 Brady.\u201d </p>\n<p>The Mario Kart competition somehow lasts until lunch, with lots of kids getting tagged in as substitutes, and even Steve trying a couple of rounds - he\u2019s not bad, but there\u2019s a whole minute where he\u2019s driving into a wall repeatedly, and he can never get out of the way of the banana peels that Bucky throws. Bucky and Steve distribute the meals again, and then help with cleaning up the kitchen. When Steve asks about their own lunch, Bucky blinks like he\u2019d forgotten about eating entirely, and they end up buying several of everything from the vending machine and sitting side by side on the tile floor, eating messy chips and licking chocolate from their fingers. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you ever get angry that we were only one year away from experiencing Almond Joys when they first started making them?\u201d Steve asks, because it\u2019s easier than any of his other questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly every time I eat an Almond Joy,\u201d Bucky says, crumbling a Kit Kat wrapper in his metal hand. \u201cToo bad the war couldn\u2019t wait. For several reasons.\u201d He sorts through his remaining junk food, says, \u201cI\u2019ll trade you a bag of Doritos for that Reese\u2019s.\u201d Steve pulls a face, grips his package of Reese\u2019s Cups protectively.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible trade, you cheat,\u201d he says. Bucky laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, if I was gonna cheat you, I\u2019d just--\u201d and then he\u2019s kissing Steve, and Steve\u2019s lost in the faint chocolate taste of Bucky\u2019s mouth, and in seconds Bucky is smiling against Steve\u2019s lips and pulling away, opening a pack of Reese\u2019s Cups as he goes. Steve blinks, his mouth swollen and red and open, and Bucky grins at him from around a bite of peanut butter and chocolate. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Steve says, and Bucky laughs again, victorious and merciless.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that was with me getting it right out of your <i>hands</i>,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s hope no supervillains ever learn of your weakness, or you\u2019ll be necking with Thor\u2019s little brother next time he visits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody says \u2018necking\u2019 anymore,\u201d Steve says, stubborn and pouting as best as he can. Bucky gives an exaggerated sigh and hands him a Peanut Butter Cup.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a damn shame,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cIt was a great term. You ready for Round Two at the Infectious Diseases Unit?\u201d </p>\n<p>The afternoon sees more parents hovering anxiously against walls, always instantly relieved when they see Bucky. He stops to talk to them all, introduces them to Steve, asks them questions about the kids\u2019 conditions that the kids can\u2019t answer. One mother starts crying while describing the horrible side effects that the treatment is having on her son, and Bucky puts his metal arm around her shoulders, lets her sob on his chest, and Steve wonders, with a sudden jolt of shame and grief, if Bucky had ever had to do the same with Steve\u2019s mother. It\u2019s over an hour before Bucky goes back to playing with the children, in a corner this time, helping a little boy decorate a Barbie Dream House. Steve stands nearby, watching silently, and after a few minutes, he feels a tugging at his jeans. </p>\n<p>He looks down to see a girl with pink and purple hair. \u201cWell, hello there,\u201d he says, crouching down to look at her face. \u201cI met your brother Brady earlier. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLila,\u201d she says, hugging a doll with pink and purple braids to her chest and twisting from side to side. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a beautiful name, Lila,\u201d Steve says. \u201cJust like your hair.\u201d Lila giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice,\u201d she says. \u201cJust like Bucky said.\u201d Steve smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he says. \u201cDo you like when Bucky visits?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Lila says. \u201cHe gives me hugs and toys, and he\u2019s nice to Mommy and Daddy and Brady.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe was always real nice to me, too,\u201d Steve says. Lila nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe news and the Smith-zone-yun say you\u2019re Captain America,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we kids here, we know the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Steve asks. He\u2019s not sure where this is going.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Lila. \u201cJust like we know Bucky isn\u2019t really Winter Soldier. We know he\u2019s really Bucky Barnes, and you\u2019re really Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes\u2019 best friend.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s an identifier Steve hasn\u2019t heard spoken with such conviction and certainty in decades, and maybe that\u2019s why it knocks the breath out of him like fights never do anymore. He remembers Bucky at the signing a couple of months ago, the way he was so careful, and asks Lila, \u201cCan I give you a hug?\u201d When Lila nods and throws her own arms open, Steve leans in and holds her, ends up lifting her off the ground without even meaning to. Tears escape his eyes, and he has to wipe at his face quickly with the back of his hand when he lets her go. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Steve Rogers,\u201d Lila says, patting him on the elbow. \u201cGrownups are always crying \u2018round me, but I\u2019m getting better!\u201d She skips off proudly, and Steve watches her plop down on the floor next to Bucky, who elicits her help with decorating immediately. Steve leaves the room as inconspicuously as possible, heads down the hall to the family lounge, where he sits in the first empty chair he sees and rests his head in his hands. </p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a rough time of it?\u201d a woman next to him asks, and he sits up instantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m not--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptain Rogers!\u201d the woman says. \u201cI guess Sergeant Barnes finally brought you.\u201d Steve blinks at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh--\u201d</p>\n<p>She holds out her hand. \u201cMajor General Tricia Martin,\u201d she says. \u201cCall me Trish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you call me Steve,\u201d he says, shaking her hand. \u201cYou know Bucky?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s been in and out of here for the better part of a year,\u201d Trish says. \u201cCompromised immune system. Gets infections a lot. Sergeant Barnes is a star around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your daughter,\u201d Steve says, and Trish frowns, shrugs a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt kills me to see her so sick over and over. Just when we think she\u2019s in the clear, something else crops up. But like I said, Barnes is a star. He makes these kids so happy, keeps them getting the care they need.\u201d Steve furrows his brow, and Trish tilts her head. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t told you? He pays for all the parts of the hospital bills that insurance won\u2019t cover, expensive medications and experimental treatments, long stays, all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor--for this ward?\u201d Steve asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the whole children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Trish says. \u201cApparently on his second day volunteering here, he went to the billing department, wanted to pay the balances for everyone who\u2019d been in the Cancer Unit for the past three months. Raised hell when they wouldn\u2019t do it, but I guess he wore them down eventually. Maybe something to do with the arm.\u201d She holds up her left arm, widens her eyes meaningfully. \u201cAnyway, now he covers it all, and I heard the nurses saying he\u2019s talking to someone about setting up a scholarship program so that kids from poor families can come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve stares at her. \u201cI--\u201d he says. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he keeps it all anonymous here,\u201d Trish says. \u201cOr tries to. Most of the parents know anyway, word gets around, but we don\u2019t say anything to him about it. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want recognition. Figured he would\u2019ve told you, though.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s still playing it close to the chest, after what he\u2019s been through, and I don\u2019t even know the half of it, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She sets a grateful expression on Steve. It makes him feel vaguely uncomfortable. \u201cI feel like I should thank you, Steve, for finding him. We\u2019re damn lucky to have Barnes back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe?\u201d Steve says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe country,\u201d Trish says, looking away from Steve. \u201cThe Avengers, the citizens, the kids. I hope you don\u2019t take offense to this, but when I was in elementary school, we did projects every November on famous veterans. Everybody - including me, the first year - would claw at each other to get to write about you, but every year after the projects were presented, I always went home thinking, Bucky Barnes is the kind of guy you want on your side. You got all the glory and a catchy song, not that you didn\u2019t deserve it, of course, but--well, Bucky was captured and tortured and he still stayed to fight alongside you.\u201d She nods to herself, repeats, \u201cHe\u2019s the guy I want on my side.\u201d She looks back up at Steve again. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods at her, resolute. \u201cI know I am,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been lucky I\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The sun is on its way to setting when Steve and Bucky finally leave the hospital. On the train, Bucky falls asleep with his head on Steve\u2019s shoulder, and when they\u2019re walking to the Tower, Bucky pulls Steve into a tiny florist shop. Steve watches as Bucky personally chooses flowers for three different bouquets, writes notes for each, and retrieves the custom-made dolls from his pockets, arranges them in the bouquets to hold the notes. He doesn\u2019t ask how Bucky knows the addresses of the families who lost their children in the hospital, or why Bucky doesn\u2019t sign his name on the card, just draws a little Bucky Bear under sincere condolences, or how Bucky knows which family wouldn\u2019t like which flowers. Earlier Steve had so many questions, and now he has too many answers, and he\u2019s not sure how to get his bearings in this new place.</p>\n<p>At the Tower, Bucky eats a messy burger and won\u2019t stop asking Bruce about medical research funding, says, \u201cHuh? No, of course not,\u201d when Sam asks if he\u2019s in need of medical care or something, ignores Tony\u2019s requests for a change in topic of conversation. Steve doesn\u2019t eat, blames a headache that isn\u2019t real, excuses himself from the table. When he gets to his own floor, he goes to the kitchen, thinking he\u2019ll eat alone and won\u2019t feel smothered by the heaviness of the day, but he only gets as far as the sink when tears begin stinging at his eyes.</p>\n<p>Bucky finds him in the living room three hours later, red-rimmed eyes and all, staring at the muted TV. </p>\n<p>\u201cMan, why do we all like Criminal Minds so much in this house?\u201d Bucky says, sitting down on the sofa next to Steve. \u201cYou\u2019d think between the eight of us, we\u2019ve seen enough sick shit in real life.\u201d Steve says nothing, doesn\u2019t take his eyes off the television, and Bucky puts a hand on the back of Steve\u2019s neck. \u201cHey,\u201d he says softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it Lila? I saw you talking to her today. She was telling the truth, you know, she <i>is</i> getting better. Her parents said she might even be able to go back to school in a couple weeks.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve looks at him then, blinking wide eyes. For a long moment, he simply stares, and then he shakes his head in disbelief. \u201cHow are you like this?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow do you do what you did today <i>all the time</i>, and send flowers to grieving families, and pay for medical bills--\u201d Bucky flushes at that, looks away from Steve\u2019s face like he\u2019s ashamed. \u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says, and waits for Bucky\u2019s eyes to reach his again. \u201cHow can you do this and still think--Bucky, you\u2019re the <i>best</i> of us, of all of us, and you still don\u2019t think you deserve any of this, I know you don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know <i>how</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs and it makes Steve want to cry again. \u201cIt\u2019s not as important as all that,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cIt\u2019s selfish, really - those kids are no different than you were when we were their age. You don\u2019t need me like that anymore, not since you gained a hundred fifty pounds of pure muscle, but they do, and it\u2019s--\u201d He shrugs again, looks away, runs the metal hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to feel needed. Like I said, it\u2019s selfish.\u201d Steve stares at him in silence until Bucky looks up at him again, nervous eyes and pursed lips. </p>\n<p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says, imploring, \u201cthat\u2019s not--it\u2019s not <i>selfish</i>, what you do. It wasn\u2019t <i>selfish</i> when you made me soup and risked catching fever by curling up with me in my sickbed. It was never <i>selfish</i>, you stealing heliox from the hospital for my asthma, or working triple shifts when no one would hire sick little Steve Rogers so we could afford to see a picture the next weekend, or letting me throw a few pathetic punches before stepping in to save my ass. It\u2019s not <i>selfish</i> to be there when someone needs you.\u201d Bucky looks down at his knees, swallows, and Steve says, \u201cAnd I <i>do</i> still need you.\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes shift back up at him. \u201cMaybe not to nurse me back from near death, but to be here, next to me, with me?\u201d He takes Bucky\u2019s hand in both of his, says, \u201cI need you, Bucky. I\u2019m always gonna need you.\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes are wet and shining, and Steve has wanted to kiss him all day, so he leans over and presses his lips to the soft skin under Bucky\u2019s eye, trails down to kiss Bucky\u2019s trembling mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky says, voice hoarse. \u201cWhat\u2019d I do in a past life to deserve you, huh?\u201d Steve smiles against the corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth, rests another kiss there before moving to Bucky\u2019s jaw. </p>\n<p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Steve murmurs, \u201cbut clearly I was there, too.\u201d</p>"
