  "text": "<p>The only good thing about Oxenfurt is the brothels.</p>\n<p>Geralt tries to avoid it. The whole city is too noisy and too bright and just <em>too much</em>, even more than most cities. But there\u2019d been a big contract to clear out group of drowners and a griffin that\u2019s been killing people and leaving them in pieces in the surrounding forest.</p>\n<p>The mayor paid Geralt half up front. He should be grateful, he knows, but it just makes him suspicious. He\u2019s not even sure of what, specifically. Possibly he\u2019s just suspicious of everyone these days. Not that it matters.</p>\n<p>He has the coin and absolutely no reason not to spend some of it on the city\u2019s one redeeming feature. The brothels have nice, clean rooms and pretty girls who are very good at pretending and not flinching when they see him.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t go to brothels with swords on his back, he doesn\u2019t go in armor, he doesn\u2019t go with his hair uncombed. He hates the sour milk smell of fear they get, and he does what he can to mitigate it. It doesn\u2019t matter if they know he\u2019s a witcher, although they figure it out quickly enough between the medallion and the eyes. He\u2019s off-putting frightening all on his own. There\u2019s something in humans\u2019 often ignored instincts that tell them he\u2019s dangerous and they\u2019re right. They start afraid, but if he softens himself just a little then they\u2019re not terrified, and by the end when they\u2019re <em>both</em> sated, they\u2019re just nervous, which smells like bitter root but is tolerable.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, in Oxenfurt, the girl will start at nervous and end at wary, an almost ignorable mulch scent, and she won\u2019t smell of anxiety when Geralt tugs her into his side, sometimes he can just hold someone for a while and not feel like he\u2019s actually holding them hostage.</p>\n<p>Usually, he\u2019s not that lucky. Usually, the smell of their fear makes him as eager as they are to get it all over with. Usually, when he does get lucky, it\u2019s in Oxenfurt.</p>\n<p>This time he gets very lucky.</p>\n<p>The madame doesn\u2019t hesitate to take his coin, although she does look him over in a way that\u2019s not even slightly sexual and say, \u201cUpstairs, first door on the right. Should be ready, but you might have to wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>That she has someone in mind and isn\u2019t just throwing him at the first free girl means it\u2019s probably worth having to wait for the previous customer to finish. Usually when that happens, he gets to skip over the sour milk fear scent all together.</p>\n<p>Usually.</p>\n<p>But the first door on the right isn\u2019t closed, is already half open, so he pushes it open the rest of the way. He means to clear his throat and ends up swallowing his tongue partway through.</p>\n<p>The whore is a man.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s young, in nothing but his smallclothes and the billowing shirt that goes to the top of his thighs and is open at the chest revealing a chest of thick hair, so he can\u2019t be <em>that</em> young. His skin is tan and unscarred and his hair is thick and deep brown.</p>\n<p>Geralt must make some sort of noise, because the man looks up and Geralt finds himself the subject of two bright, perfectly blue eyes. The smile that steals across the man\u2019s face has to be a reflex, but it looks so genuine that Geralt can\u2019t help but flinch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, look at you,\u201d he says, dropping the pair of pants he\u2019d been holding. He crosses the room without hesitating, reaches out a hand and cups Geralt\u2019s face and tilts it to the side.</p>\n<p>Geralt can only stare. People never touch him first, and especially not like this. Not even in a brothel.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re nearly the same height. The look on the man\u2019s face is admiring, and he drags a calloused thumb down Geralt\u2019s cheekbone, ending with it pressed against Geralt\u2019s bottom lip.</p>\n<p>This close, with the man\u2019s wrist practically pressed against his nose, he should be able to smell his fear, it should be overpowering.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s none of it.</p>\n<p>Not the spoiled milk scent, no bitter root, no mulch. Just the thick spiciness of arousal and hints of lemon.</p>\n<p>Lemon is for happiness, for delight. No one smells like lemons around Geralt.</p>\n<p>Even Renfri had smelled of mulch, her wariness sharp in his nose, although he doesn\u2019t know if that had anything to do with him. She\u2019d always smelled like that, no matter where she was or who she was with.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so thrown that he doesn\u2019t even hear someone behind him until a woman voice says, \u201cUm, are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMariel, I think we\u2019re both all set here,\u201d the man says confidently. \u201cAren\u2019t we, darling? I\u2019ll do, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Geralt a long moment to figure out that the man\u2019s talking to him, the endearment distracting him from the actual question.</p>\n<p>The bitter root smell is in the room now, but it\u2019s coming from the girl behind him, not the man in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and nearly forgets to breathe when the man uses the opportunity to slip his thumb into Geralt\u2019s mouth. The sting of salt from dried sweat dissolves against his tongue and Geralt is so painfully hard that it\u2019s embarrassing. The man\u2019s barely touched him, but in some ways he\u2019s already touched him so much more than he\u2019d expected to be touched.</p>\n<p>Mariel fidgets, the bitter root souring to something deeper and more unpleasant. \u201cHe\u2019s a <em>witcher</em>, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt tenses, waits for the man, for Jaskier, to do the same, for his sweet sent to sour.</p>\n<p>He blinks, eyes flickering to Geralt\u2019s chest, to his wolf medallion, but he just shrugs. \u201cExplains the pretty eyes. All witchers have eyes as pretty as yours?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Pretty</em>? His eyes aren\u2019t pretty, for fuck\u2019s sake. They\u2019re inhuman. He has sickly yellow eyes, just like the eyes of so many beasts he\u2019s killed. There\u2019s nothing pretty about them. Which means he has no idea what to say to that, so he just sucks on the thumb in his mouth instead. Jaskier\u2019s breath hitches and his eyes darken and his scent stays sweet, so Geralt supposes it was the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d she says slowly, but when neither of them answer her, she just sighs and leaves, closing the door behind her.</p>\n<p>The man smiles and drags his thumb against Geralt\u2019s teeth as he pulls it out of his mouth and he tries not to mourn the loss. \u201cYou got a name, witcher? Or should I guess? I\u2019ve only heard of one white haired witcher, but I suppose that doesn\u2019t mean there is only one white haired witcher.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s hands reach under his shirt and press against his ribs, dragging rough fingertips over his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess,\u201d he says, trying not to growl. The only story people tell of him is of the Butcher of Blaviken. If Jaskier\u2019s heard about him, it\u2019s nothing good. He regrets it as soon as he says it, he should have just told him his name, because Jaskier will call him the butcher and he\u2019ll say he\u2019s Geralt and maybe he won\u2019t know that they\u2019re the same person or maybe he will but either way it\u2019s not going to end well.</p>\n<p>If Jaskier notices the downturn in his mood, he doesn\u2019t show it. Instead he steps even closer, pushes himself up to lick up the shell of Geralt\u2019s ear, and says, \u201cGeralt of Rivia, my very pretty witcher, how do you want me?\u201d</p>\n<p>The shock of it is enough that Geralt\u2019s mouth parts as his eyes widen. Jaskier makes a pleased sound and turns Geralt\u2019s face towards him, slipping his tongue into his slack mouth while dragging his hand down his spine. Geralt\u2019s incisors are slightly longer than a human\u2019s, not enough for people to notice normally, but people do usually notice when they\u2019re kissing him, it makes the sour scent thicken before it softens. Sometimes whores don\u2019t kiss him at all, simply turn their faces away, and he doesn\u2019t insist.</p>\n<p>Jaskier either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care, widening his mouth and kissing him more deeply and Geralt shudders and kisses him back, as skillfully as he knows how, and can\u2019t help the smirk curling the edge of his lips when Jaskier moans into his mouth. Jaskier pulls back, but he trails kisses along the edge of Geralt\u2019s jaw, so he can\u2019t really bring himself to mind. \u201cAre you going to touch me, Geralt? Or should I just continue doing to you as I please?\u201d</p>\n<p>He realizes with a start that his hands are still by his sides. \u201cI-\u201d He doesn\u2019t know what to say. Part of him wants to just let Jaskier do as he pleases, wants him to touch him as if he wants him. He\u2019s slept with plenty of people, but no one who\u2019s reacted like this, who\u2019s so blatantly interested and unafraid. He knows Jaskier is only touching him because he\u2019s paying for it, but he can\u2019t hide his scent, he really is enjoying this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to touch you,\u201d Jaskier declares, sliding a finger in the waistband of his pants and tugging. \u201cIt would be a bit easier if you weren\u2019t wearing quite so much, darling. Care to make this easier for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Unbelievable.</p>\n<p>He kicks off his boots while he pulls his shirt over his head. Jaskier makes a startled sound and he tenses. His torso is littered with scars, evidence of exactly who and what he is, and he expects this to be the point when Jaskier\u2019s starts to second guess all of this.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s grinning, head tilted to the side as he looks him up and down. \u201cI must have been a very good boy this year,\u201d he says nonsensically, stepping forward to spread his hands over Geralt\u2019s chest, flicking his nipples almost absently. \u201cCan I mark you or will your witcher healing spoil all my fun?\u201d His wariness must show on his face because Jaskier rolls his eyes and clarifies, \u201cIf I suck a bruise into your skin will it even show up?\u201d</p>\n<p>No one has ever tried, but he\u2019s been hurt enough to know the answer to that. \u201cAn hour, maybe, if you make it deep enough. A couple minutes otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason Jaskier seems delighted. \u201cSounds like a challenge. I love those.\u201d He undoes Geralt\u2019s pants, pushing them down, and there\u2019s a spike in the spiciness in his scent as he looks Geralt over, his eyes lingering on his cock. \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to enjoy this,\u201d he says, and everything from his scent to his tone to his face seems to imply that he means it. \u201cAre you going to fuck me? Because I would like that, quite a lot, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>His cock twitches. That\u2019s not always on the table with men, even if he\u2019s paying for it. At least if he doesn\u2019t want them to be scared. But Jaskier is grinning and eager so he says, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he says, grabbing Geralt\u2019s hand and dragging him over to the bed. He makes a detour to toss a bottle of oil onto the mattress and then pushes Geralt onto it. He lets him, lets Jaskier guide him until he\u2019s lying back with Jaskier leaning over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems you have me at an unfair advantage,\u201d he says, tugging on Jaskier\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>He blinks. \u201cOh, right! Should have thought of that, you\u2019re just so distracting.\u201d He pulls his flimsy shirt over his head, and his arms and waist are thick with muscle, just like the gorgeous thighs bracketing Geralt\u2019s hips. \u201cShould we get down to business or can I blow you first? Also I need a bit of stretching if I\u2019m going to be able walk right tomorrow. Unless you\u2019re into that kind of thing, in which case I suppose walking is overrated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt has never had someone talk so much while in bed with him. It\u2019s not unpleasant, exactly, but it\u2019s hard to focus. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d That\u2019s familiar territory at least. It\u2019s usually something he has to say more than once when he\u2019s in a whore\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses, his grin softening, and when he leans over to kiss Geralt that\u2019s soft too. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you sweet,\u201d he mutters, kissing the corner of Geralt\u2019s mouth. \u201cSweet and pretty and all for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t understand anything that\u2019s happening right now, so he just kisses him back.</p>\n<p>Jaskier cups his face while he kisses him, which isn\u2019t something people usually do. He can\u2019t tell if he likes it. Eventually Jaskier kisses lower, dragging his teeth down Geralt\u2019s neck with just enough pressure to make him hiss, and then across his chest. He pauses at his sternum, and Geralt thinks for a moment that he\u2019s looking at the amulet, but then he nudges it aside with his nose and says, \u201cJust, sorry, one minute,\u201d and Geralt thinks he\u2019s going to get up for something but just presses his face into Geralt\u2019s chest, opens his mouth, and starts kissing and licking and sucking one spot.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trying to give him a damn love bite in the middle of his chest.</p>\n<p>Geralt laughs, but Jaskier just lifts a flailing hand up to smack it over his mouth. He\u2019s smiling, not able to dredge up any irritation, and tilts his head just enough to take three of Jaskier\u2019s fingers in his mouth at once.</p>\n<p>Jaskier groans, but doesn\u2019t pause in what he\u2019s doing, so Geralt sucks on his fingers and moves his tongue between them, careful to keep them out of the way of his too sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>Finally he lifts his head and demands, \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Geralt, can I get my mouth on your cock or can\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot stopping you,\u201d he answers, startled at the force of it. Jaskier is the strangest whore he\u2019s ever slept with. Not that he\u2019s complaining.</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes then glares at his chest. Geralt looks down and sees a bruise that\u2019s already faded to pale lavender and dark red. \u201cThat didn\u2019t last very long at all,\u201d Jaskier huffs. \u201cThis really is a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently the only part of Geralt being a witcher that Jaskier finds offensive is his inability to leave marks on him. This man is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a disappointed hum before continuing his trail of kisses down his chest, stopping at his cock. He hums, tilting his head to the side, and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can manage to get all that down my throat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most people can\u2019t. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m very worried about it,\u201d he says, patting Geralt\u2019s thigh. \u201cI told you, I like a challenge.\u201d He spreads Geralt\u2019s legs a little wider to make room for himself between them, wraps his fingers around the base of his cock, then leans over to slide his lips over it until the head hits the back of his throat. He adjusts his position so he can start nudging it down his throat before pulling back and doing it all again.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier!\u201d Geralt fits his hands in the sheets to keep from grabbing onto Jaskier. He looks up at him from between his thighs, mouth obviously occupied but his bright blue eyes crinkled in the corners like he\u2019s smiling. He reaches out and grabs Geralt\u2019s hand, tugging at until he lets go of the sheets, and then places it against the back of his head. He curls his fingers into Jaskier\u2019s hair, trying to still be gentle and biting his bottom lip to muffle his groans and gasps.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is good at this. Most whores are good at it, but Geralt doesn\u2019t usually enjoy it this much. He\u2019s had more experienced blowjobs, once a girl took him down to the root on the first try and her smugness at his surprise almost made up for the bitter root scent on her skin, but he\u2019s never had a more enthusiastic one. Jaskier really seems like he\u2019s enjoying this, and Geralt doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s still early in the night so he hasn\u2019t tired himself out yet or something else, but he knows it\u2019s not fake, not entirely. Every time he ducks back down he takes Geralt a little deeper, just that much more down his throat, and it takes everything he has not to rock his hips into it, not to choke Jaskier by moving too fast. He\u2019s clearly working up to it, and Geralt getting impatient won\u2019t get him there any faster.</p>\n<p>It takes several long minutes, but then Jaskier\u2019s nose is pressed to his skin, his cock nestled in the warm heat of his throat as he swallows around him, and Geralt honestly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s more arousing \u2013 the tight, wet heat or the way Jaskier\u2019s doing his best to smirk around his cock. \u201cIf you want me to fuck you,\u201d he says, strained, \u201cthis is the wrong way to go about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not that it\u2019ll really be a disappointment if he\u2019s changed his mind, not that Geralt is at all upset at the idea of coming in his smirking mouth.</p>\n<p>Jaskier pulls himself off with an obscene sound that almost makes Geralt want to yank him back into place. He rests his cheek against Geralt\u2019s thigh, lips red and shiny with spit, his mouth looking faintly used in a way goes straight to his cock. \u201cFuck,\u201d he rasps, \u201cEssi is going to kill me for fucking up my voice. Worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour voice?\u201d he asks, because if he doesn\u2019t focus on something else, he\u2019s going to come the moment Jaskier touches him, which obviously isn\u2019t what he wants. He wants to enjoy this while he has it, wants to enjoy Jaskier while he has him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI sing,\u201d he says absently. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do that, but just look at you, how could I not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t know for sure if he\u2019s lying, but if he is then he\u2019s doing an exceptional job at it. He doesn\u2019t know what to say in response. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hauls himself up. \u201cYou going to fuck me now?\u201d</p>\n<p>His cock gives in interested twitch at that. \u201cThe oil?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaken care of,\u201d he says, getting to his knees, and Geralt\u2019s sucks a breath in. The hand Jaskier hadn\u2019t been using to keep his cock steady is glistening, and he can see hints of that same oil between Jaskier\u2019s thighs.</p>\n<p>Jaskier had been working himself open while he\u2019d worked Geralt down his throat.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably for the best he hadn\u2019t known that, actually, because he would have come far before he\u2019d wanted to.</p>\n<p>Jaskier grins, something knowing in the glint of his eyes. \u201cLike that, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he growls, tugging Jaskier up to kiss him.</p>\n<p>He reaches between Jaskier\u2019s legs, because he wants to be sure, but he slips two fingers in easily and a third with only a token resistance and a groan into his mouth. \u201cDo I pass inspection?\u201d Jaskier pants, licking the tip of his nose in a way that\u2019s clearly supposed to be annoying but Geralt thinks is actually kind of adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he repeats, because he doesn\u2019t, he never does with anyone, but especially Jaskier, especially now. He\u2019s seemed to enjoy this so far, seemed to enjoy Geralt so far. He doesn\u2019t want that to change, he wants to continue to melt into the scents of spice and lemon, of arousal and pleasure.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and then Jaskier kisses his forehead, so unexpectedly tender that Geralt can\u2019t help his surprised intake of breath. \u201cSo sweet,\u201d he mutters, and for some reason that\u2019s what causes heat to flush across Geralt\u2019s cheeks. \u201cIs like this okay or do you want me under you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike this,\u201d he says. That way Jaskier will control the pace and Geralt won\u2019t have to pay attention or worry about going too quickly like if it was the other way around. Jaskier leans back, sitting upright with his knees squeezing Geralt\u2019s hips as he reaches beneath him, feeling for Geralt\u2019s cock and nudging it against his entrance.</p>\n<p>The sound Jaskier makes as he sinks down onto his cock is going to be seared into his head for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s ever going to manage to be with another person soaked in fear after this, when he has the memory of his nose filled with the scent lemons and Jaskier taking him so perfectly, his head thrown back and his thighs trembling with effort as he takes him inch by inch. When he\u2019s fully inside him, Jaskier shifts his hips, getting used to the feeling, and Geralt asks, his voice hoarse, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we are so past okay,\u201d he says breathlessly, his voice still with that hint of raspiness. He rides him, moving slowly, and Geralt raises his hands to grip Jaskier\u2019s thighs, digging his fingers into the muscles just shy of bruising. Jaskier gasps, then pauses and says, \u201cI have an idea. A girl did this to me once and I loved it. Bend your knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt raises an eyebrow, but does it, pressing his feet flat against the bed and pushing his knees up. Jaskier grins and leans back, pressing the smooth skin of his back against Geralt\u2019s thighs, changing the angle so Geralt is impossibly even deeper inside him and forcing a groan from his mouth that Geralt tries and fails to choke back.</p>\n<p>Jaskier grins, a sheen of sweat all over his body, and starts twisting and rocking his hips, short little movements that shouldn\u2019t amount to much but make Geralt\u2019s blood feel like it\u2019s on fire. \u201cFuck!\u201d he shouts, and he\u2019s definitely going to leave hand shaped bruises on Jaskier\u2019s thighs, but Jaskier doesn\u2019t seem to mind, too busy making breathy little gasps as he fucks himself onto Geralt\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t thrust into him, even though he desperately wants to. Instead he just holds on, lets Jaskier does what he wants and tries to survive it. He could come right now but he does everything he can not to, not wanting this to be over.</p>\n<p>Jaskier slows and Geralt growls, a sound he regrets making, but Jaskier only laughs and says, \u201cDarling, if we keep going, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asks, taken aback.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s skin is all flushed as he nods jerkily. \u201cLike this. You feel amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d he says, part challenge and part plea. He jerks his hips up just once, just to get Jaskier moving again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d he cries, blue eyes wide, and Geralt worries for a moment but nothing about him smells like pain and he goes back to what he was doing, leaning back against Geralt\u2019s thighs and writhing on his cock. He can tell when Jaskier is close by the way his movements go from smooth and controlled to jerky and uncoordinated, and then he\u2019s coming with a keen, covering Geralt\u2019s hands with his own and his come striping over Geralt\u2019s stomach, his cheeks an attractive shade of red and his eyes unfocussed.</p>\n<p>His movements slow as he takes in great gasps of air, trying to catch his breath, and Geralt is so fucking hard and wants to move so badly, but he doesn\u2019t. He just watches Jaskier settle back in his skin, overwhelmed with the smell of spice and lemon.</p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a little laugh, shaking his head. \u201cSo polite, giving me time,\u201d he mutters, a lopsided grin on his mouth. \u201cMy polite, sweet, pretty witcher.\u201d He raises Geralt\u2019s hand to his mouth and presses a kiss to the back of it. Geralt doesn\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever kissed him there before. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so polite, so good. But you can touch me, you know? I won\u2019t break.\u201d His grin turns sly. \u201cOf course, if you <em>want</em> to just lie there and take it, that\u2019s fine too. But you can touch me. You don\u2019t have to be so careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s eyes are too wide, his breath coming in too short, but he can\u2019t make it stop. All of his interactions with humans are careful. They have to be. Because they look at his eyes, and they don\u2019t see pretty. They see a monster\u2019s eyes in a man\u2019s face, and the best he can hope for is when people look at him they see <em>not human, but human enough</em>, and so rarely does he get even that.</p>\n<p>He yanks Jaskier down and rolls them over, so Jaskier\u2019s on his back with his legs spread, Geralt on him, in him, and braces his arms on either side of Jaskier\u2019s head, completely surrounding him, boxing him in. Humans hate that.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s smiling and all Geralt can smell is lemons.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asks, more quietly than he means to, but unable to make himself be any louder.</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he says, droll and wicked something from his dreams and nightmares both, \u201c<em>fuck me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s snapping his hips into him before he can think not to. Jaskier\u2019s already came, but he moans and wraps his legs around Geralt\u2019s waist anyway. He locks his wrists together behind Geralt\u2019s neck, pulling him in even closer, until Jaskier can kiss him and gasp into his mouth.</p>\n<p>He comes inside Jaskier, fucking into him with the last few desperate thrusts as he mouths at the side of his jaw, panting. He slows, turning his head just enough kiss Jaskier properly, something in him going soft and liquid at the satisfied hum in his mouth. Geralt pulls out of him carefully then falls onto the bed next to him, more exhausted than he can remember being in a long time.</p>\n<p>Jaskier turns so they\u2019re both on their sides, face to face with barely any space between them. It seems more intimate, somehow, than when Geralt had been inside of him. Jaskier reaches out, cupping his jaw and pressing his thumb against Geralt\u2019s bottom lip, just like he had before. \u201cGood?\u201d he asks, lips curled up in the corners.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, eyes heavy.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s face is so soft and fond that Geralt thinks it can\u2019t be directed at him, even though it\u2019s just the two of them here. He pulls himself closer, \u201cCome on, Geralt, it looks like you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, but follows the direction of Jaskier\u2019s hands and is only confused when he finds himself half sprawled over Jaskier, his head on his chest and his leg tangled between Jaskier\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Jaskier rubs a hand up and down his back, soothing and electrifying at the same time. He presses a kiss to the top of Geralt\u2019s head. \u201cGet some sleep, my polite, sweet, pretty witcher.\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorts, but feels nearly boneless already, too heavy on top of Jaskier, but he\u2019s not complaining or pushing Geralt aside. There\u2019s some reason he shouldn\u2019t be doing this, he knows, but he can\u2019t think of it. This is most of what he really wants anyway, more than sex he just wants to be able to touch and be close to someone without them flinching.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heartbeat is steady and he smells like contentment, the gentle tugging as he runs his hands through Geralt\u2019s hair not distracting enough to keep him from sighing and giving in to the lull of sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When Geralt wakes up, it\u2019s hours later and he\u2019s alone. He can\u2019t bring himself to be that disappointed however, because the bed is still warm from Jaskier\u2019s body. He must have just left. Maybe that\u2019s even what woke him up. He worries for a moment that he\u2019s overstayed by falling asleep, but dismisses it as soon as he has it. This is a whorehouse. If they\u2019d needed the room, they would have kicked him out of it.</p>\n<p>He reaches up to run a hand through his hair, then pauses, running a cautious palm over the top of his head.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a small mirror in the room when he faces it he can\u2019t help the short bark of laughter. His hair is braided back, a neat fishtail braid that doesn\u2019t look too terrible or out of place on him, so he doesn\u2019t bother to undo it. He likes the image of it anyway, not the braid necessarily, but of Jaskier carefully plaiting his hair together as he slept. It\u2019s a quiet, sweet image.</p>\n<p>Then he looks down and he feels neither quiet nor sweet.</p>\n<p>On the place where his hip and his waist meet is a deep, black bruise the exact shape of Jaskier\u2019s mouth. He presses his thumb into it, feeling a dull, easily ignored ache at the pressure. Jaskier must have sucked this into him while he was sleeping. It\u2019ll last maybe another hour.</p>\n<p>Geralt tries to think of when he\u2019d felt comfortable enough to sleep that deeply, to the point where he didn\u2019t wake up to someone braiding his hair or mouthing at his hip, and honestly can\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t about comfort.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s that it was Jaskier, who\u2019d been bright and happy and hadn\u2019t been afraid for a second, and that\u2019s why Geralt hadn\u2019t woken up.</p>\n<p>He presses his thumb into the bruise again and can\u2019t help his smile.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The thing about griffins is that their night vision is shit. Which means they don\u2019t hunt at night, which means Geralt ends up fighting and beheading it in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p>His vision is nearly as good at night as it is in the day. He prefers fighting monsters at night when he\u2019s in the city, because then he can deliver the head at night, rather than having to walk through loud, crowded streets with it. This time is worse than usual, his potions still coursing through his veins so his skin even paler than normal and his eyes a dark black when he delivers the griffin\u2019s head to the alderman. He gives Geralt the second half of his payment without argument, but the thick sent of spoiled milk means that Geralt can only bring himself to accept with a tight nod. The dirt and blood clinging to him probably isn\u2019t helping.</p>\n<p>People are always at least nervous around him, but as he walks through the city back to the tavern, the only thing he can smell is rotting milk as everyone cringes away from him. It\u2019s so cloying and overpowering that he can\u2019t help the scowl carving its way into his face, and he knows it doesn\u2019t exactly help, but he can\u2019t force his face into anything else with that rancid smell filling his nose.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s hint of sharp lemon cutting through the rest of the smells and he breathes in to get more of it, something familiar about the scent just under it that he can\u2019t quite put his finger on.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt!\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t run away, because that would be ridiculous, but he wants to. Of course the person he wants to least see him like this is the person that finds him in the middle of busy street. When has his luck ever run any other direction? He glances around, but there\u2019s nowhere to hide, not when Jaskier has already seen him. He hates this. Jaskier might have been foolish enough to not be afraid of him with how he was at the whorehouse, clean and weaponless, but like this, filthy with his swords and armor and his eyes still bleeding black, Jaskier\u2019s scent is sure to shift from sharp lemon to sour milk.</p>\n<p>Jaskier dodges around people to get to him, a lute over his shoulder and wearing bright, fancy clothes that make him look smaller than he is, that give him the appearance of being trimmer by downplaying the strength and size of his thighs and arms. He stops in front of him, eyes wide as he looks him over. \u201cWow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt braces himself for it, tells himself that this is how humans always react, and just because it\u2019s Jaskier, just because it\u2019s a whore he fucked, doesn\u2019t mean anything different. Thousands of humans have looked at him and felt fear. Its what always happens and it doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p>\n<p>But Jaskier just tilts his head to the side and reaches out a hand. Geralt flinches, but doesn\u2019t move away, because he\u2019s an idiot. Jaskier has to notice the movement but pretends not to, stepping even closer until he can cup the side of Geralt\u2019s dirty face and press his thumb against his bottom lip. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He has no idea what\u2019s happening. He doesn\u2019t want to shake his head in case it makes Jaskier takes his hand away, so he just says, \u201cNo,\u201d while doing his best to move his lips as little as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, \u201cthen I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about how delicious you look right now. I miss the gold in your eyes, but I really must say,\u201d he looks him over again, deliberately, \u201cthis is all quite a look.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes aren\u2019t gold, that makes them sound \u2013 pretty. They\u2019re yellow, sallow yellow, like a monster\u2019s, yellow like sickness. And they\u2019re black now, something more like a nightmare than a monster. He takes a deep breath, wondering if perhaps he was poisoned without noticing it and this is all some sort of hallucination, but that just means he inhales lemon and under that the spiciness of arousal.</p>\n<p>Jaskier really is attracted to him right now.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how to respond to any of this.</p>\n<p>A grin curls into the corner of Jaskier\u2019s mouth. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have somewhere to be, I\u2019d ask you follow me into a dark alley. But Shani already gave me shit for having to heal my throat, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019d appreciate having to deal with whatever\u2019s left of me after Essi eviscerates me for being late.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart is steady, his grin easy. If he\u2019s lying, he\u2019s doing a very good job of it.</p>\n<p>He shifts his hand back so he\u2019s holding onto the back of Geralt\u2019s neck, and usually Geralt wouldn\u2019t tolerate that at all, but Jaskier is still so close and smells so good. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got my braid in. I suppose my love bite is gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>It had faded by the time he\u2019d gotten back to his room and pushed his pants down to check. He hadn\u2019t felt disappointed, because that would be ridiculous, but \u2013 he\u2019d have like it, if it\u2019d still been there. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPity,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cbut I suppose that means I\u2019ll just have to give you a new one.\u201d Before Geralt can do more than blink at the implications of that, Jaskier is using his hand on the back of his neck to pull his closer, pushing himself up that extra inch so he\u2019s tall enough to press his mouth\u2019s to Geralt\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Geralt kisses back automatically but doesn\u2019t grab onto him, mindful of Jaskier\u2019s clean, fancy clothes and not wanting to dirty them. Jaskier is kissing him in the middle of the crowded street of Oxenfurt while the sun is still high in the sky, is kissing him while he\u2019s dirty and the effects of his potion are making him look even less human than usual, is kissing him at his most terrifying, but he still only smells of lemons and spice.</p>\n<p>They pull apart and Geralt mutters, \u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d against his mouth before he can think not to.</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs, the sound nearly as bright as his eyes, and Geralt smiles without meaning to. \u201cYou know, Geralt, you\u2019re not the first person to say that to me.\u201d He gives him a quick kiss on the side of his mouth, then grins at him as he continues towards whatever it is he can\u2019t be late to. He shouts over his shoulder, \u201cBye, pretty witcher! Take a bath!\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t laugh at the he looks of incredulous horror that everyone is directing towards Jaskier, but it\u2019s near thing.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>His coin purse is heavy. He\u2019s heard rumors of work in Posada, but nothing concrete, so there\u2019s no reason to rush from Oxenfurt. Ignoring that he hates the whole city except for whorehouses. Except for one whore in particular.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not na\u00efve. He knows that Jaskier\u2019s friendliness isn\u2019t real, that it\u2019s part of what he\u2019s selling, part of what his customers are paying for. Geralt knows that. But he also knows that Jaskier\u2019s arousal and his lack of fear <em>are</em> real. That\u2019s rare enough all on its own, valuable enough all its own, that he barely cares about the rest of it being a lie.</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t really like him, probably kissed him in front of the whole town just because he thought it\u2019s be a way to get a paying customer to return, to get Geralt to come see him one more time.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s right.</p>\n<p>Geralt goes back to the whorehouse. He takes a bath, because he had been disgusting, but doesn\u2019t bother to try and soften himself like he usually would, keeps his armor on and his swords strapped across his back. Jaskier knows what he is, has seen him looking far worse just this morning.</p>\n<p>The madame raises an eyebrow when she sees him and for some reason she seems amused, of all things, which isn\u2019t the reaction he usually gets. \u201cIs Jaskier available?\u201d he asks bluntly. If he\u2019s not \u2013 well, Geralt had been willing to wait before, when he hadn\u2019t even known what he was waiting for. He\u2019s perfectly willing to wait now.</p>\n<p>Her eyes widen and she throws her head back and cackles. \u201cMariel!\u201d she snaps, and the same girl who he\u2019d seen before enters from a back room. \u201cThe witcher wants to know if Jaskier is <em>available</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marial raises a hand to hide a smile, and there\u2019s clearly some joke that Geralt isn\u2019t in on. He shoves down his spike of irritation. \u201cIs that a yes or no?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Witcher,\u201d the madame says, and the sour smell of fear has gentled into wariness, tempered even further be her amusement. \u201cJaskier is a beloved patron of our establishment, not employed by it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came in as he was leaving,\u201d Mariel explains. \u201cI was the one intended for you, before Jaskier saw you, and well. Who was I to argue?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some sort of reasonable response to this, he\u2019s sure, he just can\u2019t imagine what it would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe plays at Rosemary and Thyme quite often, if you\u2019re looking for him,\u201d she continues. \u201cOtherwise you can find him at Oxenfurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOxenfurt,\u201d he repeats, sure that he\u2019s heard her wrong while knowing that he hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s the most prestigious university on the continent.</p>\n<p>The smell of amusement almost but not quite overpowers the wariness. Her face doesn\u2019t show it beyond a slight twitch of the corners of her mouth. \u201cDo you need directions?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head and barely remembers to incline his head to both of them before stepping outside. He tilts his head into the cool night breeze, hoping it\u2019ll help him make sense of all this. It explains Jaskier\u2019s pretty silk clothes, at least, if nothing else. He shouldn\u2019t press it, shouldn\u2019t pursue it, should go back to the inn and get a good night\u2019s sleep before leaving early tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p>That would be the smart thing to do, anyway. So of course he ends up outside the tavern Mariel had told him, and he can hear singing, a deep rich male voice twining with a lighter, feminine one.</p>\n<p>He steps inside, keeping to the back with his hood up. The way a fond smile instantly finds it\u2019s way to his lips without his permission is all the reason he needs to slip back out unnoticed, but he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is singing and playing his lute while a pretty blonde woman sings next to him. It\u2019s an old song, one Geralt has heard many times before, but never sung quite so well. They dance around the stage, the occupants of the tavern clapping and egging them on, apparently familiar both with them and the song. The finish, bow, and collapse into the nearest table to loud applause. A barmaid drops two tankards of ale in front of them and they clink them together before sipping even as another performer takes the stage.</p>\n<p>Geralt moves closer before he can think better of it, picking up on their conversation even from clear across the tavern.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you won\u2019t join me, Essi? We\u2019re brilliant together,\u201d Jaskier wheedles.</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cOn your insane plan to travel the continent? No, thank you, I\u2019ll take my cushy job at Redania\u2019s court. Before you say it, yes, I know it\u2019s only backup vocals, but that\u2019s how everyone starts. You\u2019d be smart to join me, or take up Professor Kusia\u2019s offer to be his aide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoetry is a fine meal but I can\u2019t live on it alone,\u201d he says, words coming out as a scoff. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in wasting away in these halls writing sonnets, no matter how flattering Kusia\u2019s opinion is of my talent. I need to see the world, Essi! What will I do, write about these city streets and broken hearts forever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your other option is as a traveling bard, then yes,\u201d she says, derisive. \u201cYou know that only the really famous ones bother with that, when they can count on positions and coin wherever they go. You\u2019ll go hungry.\u201d She\u2019s not scolding anymore, if anything her words are tinged with concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cA traveling bard is how all the best ones start,\u201d Jaskier argues. \u201cJust because I\u2019m educated doesn\u2019t mean I can turn my back on the traditional path of our people. I\u2019m going to see the whole world and sing of its every corner. No court will be able to hold me except for the court of the wide open sky.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughs, shaking her head. \u201cWell, when the court of the wide open sky puts no bread in your belly, feel free to come to whatever court I\u2019m at. I\u2019ll feed you and you can tell me of the world while I count your ribs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier huffs, but he\u2019s still smiling at her.</p>\n<p>Geralt is finally close enough for them to notice. Essi\u2019s face pales and she grips her tankard so tightly her knuckles go white, the spoiled milk scent of her fear hitting immediately. Jaskier frowns then follow\u2019s Essi\u2019s gaze, those brilliant blue eyes landing on his own. \u201cGeralt!\u201d he cries, pushing his chair back to get to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Geralt?\u201d Essi hisses.</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t answer her, too busy smiling at him, and then Geralt can\u2019t smell fear, Essi\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s, instead he\u2019s surrounded by the scent of lemons. \u201cDid you hear us? We\u2019re rather brilliant, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d he says, because they were very good. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Jaskier asks, teasing, as he steps even closer, his eyes dropping to Geralt\u2019s lips for a moment before focusing on his eyes once more.</p>\n<p>Would Jaskier really kiss him here? In front of his friend, in front of all these people whose good opinion he values, in a place he frequents? Surely not, that\u2019d be ridicu-</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s soft lips are on his own, his hands curled into the straps of his armor, and Geralt gives a soft huff of incredulous laughter that Jaskier uses to deepen their kiss, licking into his mouth and biting his bottom lip. Geralt kisses back, because if Jaskier is going to be brave and reckless enough as to kiss him, it seems like the least Geralt can do is kiss him back. He pulls back after a moment, more than aware of all the eyes on them even if Jaskier isn\u2019t. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, \u201cis not talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier pouts, his lips red and slick. Geralt only raises an eyebrow and does not kiss him again. \u201cOh, alright. We\u2019ll talk outside, yeah? I assume you don\u2019t want to do it while everyone\u2019s staring at us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s not oblivious, then. Just stupidly brave.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier!\u201d Essi shouts. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2013 you know what he is! You can\u2019t be serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the grave,\u201d he says cheerfully, picking up his lute and slinging it over his shoulder. \u201cHave a good night, Essi. I\u2019m planning to.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s pale and furious, worry coming off her in waves, but Jaskier doesn\u2019t look back as he grabs Geralt\u2019s hand and leads them out of the loud tavern and away from the hustle and bustle of the main road, until they\u2019re walking down one of the side streets still lit by the soft glow of open shops but not quite so covered in people. Jaskier is still holding his hand. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says, when it becomes clear that Jaskier isn\u2019t going to say anything, seemingly content to wander through the city humming under his breath with their hands intertwined.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about Essi,\u201d he says. \u201cShe means well and she\u2019d warm up to you quite quickly, I think. She just doesn\u2019t handle being surprised well. I did tell her that you were a witcher, though, so it\u2019s her own fault for not believing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea of Jaskier talking about him to his friends does something strange to the center of his chest, but he ignores it for now. \u201cYou\u2019re not a whore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses, turning to face him, his eyebrows pressed together. \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were one,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you think,\u201d he starts, then falls silent, clearly running their first meeting over in his mind. \u201cOkay, well, I can see why you would think that, actually, but no, I\u2019m not. Why? Do you have something against whores? Bit hypocritical of you, if you ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cNo. Whores fuck you for coin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks then raises an eyebrow. \u201cWell, yes. That is their job, I believe, given my understanding of their profession.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a whore,\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Geralt, we have already established that,\u201d he rolls his eyes, but then he says, \u201cOh,\u201d and Geralt knows he understands. He raises their clasped hands and presses a kiss to Geralt\u2019s knuckle, and it\u2019s so small, such a little thing, but Geralt can\u2019t keep his breath from hitching anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re just so beautiful. I couldn\u2019t lose my chance to touch you. Then you had to be so sweet, so polite, so <em>nice</em>.\u201d He gives a soft laugh, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re really quite devastating, Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chest feels tight, his throat burning with all the things he doesn\u2019t know how to say, so instead he kisses Jaskier again, as gently as he knows how.</p>\n<p>Jaskier kisses back, not gently at all, and Geralt laughs again. \u201cMy room\u2019s this way,\u201d he says, \u201cif you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Jaskier says, using his free hand to cup Geralt\u2019s cheek and press his thumb against his bottom lip, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing about you that I don\u2019t want.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Geralt leaves for Posada the next morning. His hair is braided back and there\u2019s a fading love bite on his hip.</p>\n<p>Jaskier strums his lute at his side, chatting excitedly of the adventures they\u2019ll have and the songs he\u2019ll sing, his eyes a perfect, brilliant blue in the rising sun.</p>\n<p>Geralt smiles at him and breathes in, the scent of lemons heavy on the back of his tongue.</p>"
