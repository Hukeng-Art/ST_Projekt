  "summary": "<p>Peter doesn't want to go on a field trip to Stark Tower. It's a recipe for disaster. His class doesn't believe him, his teacher doesn't believe him. If he makes it through the entire day without being suspended, it'll be a miracle. Unfortunately for Peter, he's never much believed in miracles. </p>\n<p>... </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a goddamn disaster.\u201d Peter declared miserably. At least he hadn\u2019t thrown up his food. </p>\n<p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d MJ said across from him. Peter lifted up his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, how?\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ shrugged. \u201cThey could have expelled you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gaped at her. \u201cThanks MJ, that\u2019s really helpful. I feel so much better now.\u201d</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u201cQuiet please, quiet down!\u201d Mr Harrington stood at the front of the class, waving his arms, and desperately trying to maintain control of his students. Peter watched with sympathy as Flash ignored the order and continued to snigger with his cronies. MJ began to sketch the teacher\u2019s face in her notebook. \u201cFor the love of all that\u2019s good \u2013 be quiet immediately or you will all be banned from the field trip on Friday!\u201d</p>\n<p>The class was silenced at once. Even Flash swivelled in his chair and turned to stare. \u201cDid he say field trip?\u201d Ned whispered excitedly, grabbing onto Peter\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>Peter muttered a nondescript response to Ned\u2019s question, eyeing Mr Harrington with wariness. Who could blame him? He\u2019d never had good luck with field trips. Between Oscorp, Washington, and even the Homecoming\u2026 well, suffice to say he had decided that class events just didn\u2019t seem to suit him.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington exhaled, relieved at the sudden lack of noise. \u201cGood, thank you. As I was saying \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we really going on a field trip?\u201d Abe cut in. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbe, really. Please be quiet whilst I \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it somewhere better than Oscorp?\u201d Betty interrupted. \u201cThat trip was so <em>strange</em> \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were all quiet I would have told you by now!\u201d Mr Harrington snapped, frustration and anger suddenly seeping his tone. Abe and Betty went still. Ned stopped whispering, having previously been guessing where they would be going. \u201cAs I was saying. Our class has been invited on a tour of a very prestigious organisation, so I expect everyone to behave much better than you just exhibited.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were mutters of apologies. Flash rolled his eyes. MJ snorted. Peter and Ned shared a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be handing out non-disclosure agreements and permission slips, both of which absolutely must be signed by both yourself and your parents or guardians by tomorrow morning and handed back to me.\u201d Mr Harrington continued. \u201cThe trip will, as I have said, be on Friday and last all day. You must be at school by 8am when the bus leaves. If you are even a minute late, we will leave without you. We will have lunch on site, and there will be a bus back to school at 4pm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere do you think it\u2019ll be too?\u201d Ned leant over, whispering to Peter. Peter only shrugged. He wondered whether he could skip the trip and spend the day at his internship instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The young vigilante said honestly. \u201cCould be anywhere. You know I don\u2019t like field trips Ned. I mean\u2026 come on.\u201d He made a subtle hand gesture, pressing two fingertips to his wrist.</p>\n<p>Ned winced. \u201cI know, I know. You have to admit though that\u2019s had its upsides I mean you get to swing from buildings, and you have super strength and your spidey senses \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhhhh!\u201d Peter hushed, widening his eyes at Ned with what could only be described as pure exasperation. \u201cNed you know you shouldn\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cParker, Leeds! For goodness\u2019 sake what have I just said!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter and Ned jumped to attention. \u201cSorry.\u201d They mumbled, both of their cheeks tinting red at being caught whispering.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington let out another long sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cYou have to behave on Friday, boys. I can\u2019t have any single member of this class disgracing the school with less than their absolutely best behaviour. This is the first time we\u2019ve been invited to such a prestigious company, and we need to make a good impression if we want other classes to be invited back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInvited where?\u201d Betty asked impatiently. \u201cWhere are we going, Mr Harrington?\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting actually. I mean, it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d He was starting to show it, the smile turned into a beam. He clapped his hands together, bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be so pleased. It\u2019s so much better than anywhere else we\u2019ve ever been before \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell us, tell us!\u201d Came the eager chorus of the class.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington chuckled. He let the silence hold for a second, waiting for the tension to rise. \u201cClass\u2026 We\u2019re going to Stark Industries!\u201d</p>\n<p>There was only a second of shocked silence before the instant uproar. Shouting, cheering, whooping \u2013 Betty was grabbing Abe\u2019s arm and shaking it so hard he almost fell from his seat. Flash and his minions were high fiving. There were comments all around the class. <em>\u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d \u201cWorking for Stark Industries is my dream!\u201d \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see one of the Avengers?\u201d \u201cScrew the Avengers, do you think they\u2019ll let us see the biomedical labs?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ned stared at Peter. Peter stared at Mr Harrington. \u201cYou have <em>got</em> to be kidding me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Ned asked. Peter turned his head and gave him a dead stare. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t, obviously you didn\u2019t, or you would have told me wouldn\u2019t you and you said at the beginning of the announcement that you didn\u2019t know where we were going it could have been anywhere \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNed this is a disaster.\u201d Peter\u2019s heart was in his stomach. Tony was going to think this was hilarious. Maybe he could get away with not telling his mentor? Or was Tony the one to arrange it? No, the billionaire might be generous, but Peter didn\u2019t think Tony would think that far ahead. Probably? \u201cFlash already thinks I\u2019m lying about the internship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re <em>not.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI know that, obviously. I just think this trip is asking for trouble. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t go. May wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d Peter ran a hand through his hair, grasping at the strands as if it were the metaphorically straws of his ideas. \u201cI\u2019ll just spend the day holed up in Tony\u2019s lab or something, he\u2019d probably barely notice it was the daytime instead of the evening, his sleep schedule is really messed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to go!\u201d Ned argued at once, horrified. His fingers clenched down on the edge of the desk they shared, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but flinch at the hurt expression his best friend was sporting. \u201cWorking for Stark Industries is our collective dream. We have to go. Anyway, I think it\u2019ll be cool. You\u2019ll have a million opportunities to prove Flash wrong about the internship, that\u2019s got to be a bonus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter began to respond but Mr Harrington arrived at their desk, handing them their permission slips and lengthy non-disclosure agreements. Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile as he recognised Pepper\u2019s ironclad protection of the company in the wording. Mr Harrington cleared his throat above them, and Peter and Ned both looked up to see the teacher\u2019s stern look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to remind you both about the necessary good behaviour when we go on the trip.\u201d He said, looking pointedly at Peter. \u201cThat means no sneaking off, Parker, and no causing trouble of any other kind, for that matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cTrouble, sir?\u201d He didn\u2019t cause trouble. Not purposefully, anyway, though it did seem to have a habit of finding him at the worst possible moments. He\u2019d admit to the sneaking off, sure, but again that hadn\u2019t really been his fault. He was never the <em>cause </em>of the trouble<em>. </em>In fact, usually he was the solution. Usually.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, trouble, there will be none of it. Am I understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter and Ned parroted back, trying their best to look innocent. They instantaneously shared an incredulous look the moment Mr Harrington moved on, raising their brows in sync.</p>\n<p>Ned tried his best to cheer Peter up the rest of the day, attempting convince him that a trip to Stark Tower would not only be educational but entertaining. He stopped trying after Flash knocked into Peter\u2019s shoulder in the corridor, mocking, \u201cYou ready for everyone to see what a liar you are Parker? Hah! Friday can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead, Ned asked Peter a thousand questions about which Avengers remained living in the Tower, which were away on missions, which they were most likely to see. Peter didn\u2019t want to disappoint his friend by telling him that none of the Avengers team were particularly interested in chaperoning a group of school kids on a tour, so he barely responded, and let Ned chatter on.</p>\n<p>When he returned home later that night, and solemnly passed the permission slip to May, he couldn\u2019t help but groan at the amused press of her lips, the way she was trying not to laugh, the light in her eyes as she looked at him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t funny, May.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, I know, of course not. It isn\u2019t.\u201d May said, but her lips were still tweaking at the corners.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>not</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d May said again, holding her hands up in surrender. The permission slip fluttered between her fingertips before she brought it down to examine the words a second time. There was still a little bit of faint amusement stretching her lips. \u201cDoes Tony know about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scoffed. He dropped his bookbag on the coach and threw himself down in defeat. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything, but he knows about everything that happens in Stark Tower, no matter how much he likes to pretend he\u2019s completely uninterested and above it all. And, even in the smallest possible chance that he didn\u2019t know, Pepper defiantly does.\u201d</p>\n<p>May hummed in response. She set the slip down on the kitchen counter, and scrambled around for a pen before lavishly signing her signature scrawl. \u201cThere, you\u2019re going. End of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should go, if I\u2019m honest, I just think this trip is asking for trouble.\u201d Peter told her, repeating what he had told Ned. Part of him wanting her to take up the permission slip, rip it swiftly in half and throw the pieces in the air, ruining all possibility that he would be allowed on the trip.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d May said stoically, ending his dream as quickly as it started. \u201cTony would be very upset to know you aren\u2019t interested in a tour of his company. You\u2019re going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Flash \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs a nuisance, and you should have told him where to go a long time ago.\u201d May interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more buts, Peter. You\u2019re going on that trip, so don\u2019t even think about not handing in your permission slip. I\u2019ll know, and you know that I\u2019ll know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter began to reply, began to argue that he really didn\u2019t think Tony would care all that much if he found out later that Peter had skipped the tour, but May was throwing takeaway menus at him and asking him to pick dinner, effectively ending the conversation. Peter flicked through them absentmindedly. He picked the Thai place they loved, and they spent the rest of the evening with their crossed over each other on the couch, swapping gossip from the hospital and school.</p>\n<p>Once Peter had gone to bed, May quietly stepped out into the hallway and took out her phone. She needed to be far enough from Peter\u2019s room that he couldn\u2019t overhear her with his spidey senses. The dial rang three times before clicking on. \u201cMay? Is everything alright? Is the kid okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine Tony. But\u2026 I have a favour to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOminous, but as always your wish is my command Aunt Hottie. What do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>When Friday morning came, Peter dragged himself out of bed with a groan, ignoring May\u2019s teasing through the walls about his reluctance. If he could get up for school after a patrol, she said, he could get up for this. She gave him a knowing grin and a kiss on the top of his head as he left. It would usually make him feel so much better, he was an affectionate kid after all, but today it made him scowl \u2013 prompting May to laugh harder, and him to slam the door a little too hard on the way out.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to tour Stark Tower. Stark Tower was incredible, as was the company that resided in it, and Ned was right in saying that it had always been their joint dream to work there side by side. The labs were unbelievable, and he had spent a little time there but not much since he was always with Tony on his personal floor. It would be amazing to see more of the other intern\u2019s work. They would probably tour the Avengers exhibition, and Peter always enjoyed that.</p>\n<p>But between the chances of Tony butting in and doing something embarrassing or stupid or over the top, and the fact his classmates didn\u2019t believe he worked as an intern in the first place, it seemed like to perfect recipe for Parker-luck to strike and mayhem to descend.</p>\n<p>Peter could only hope he was wrong.</p>\n<p>He trudged to school, meeting Ned in the parking lot with the rest of their class. MJ jutted her head at him and after a minute of inspecting his expression, withdrew her notepad and began to sketch. Peter began to question it when another voice called out \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Parker, yo Parker!\u201d Peter groaned as Flash\u2019s hand shoved his shoulder. It took all his lacking energy to not move on instinct and instead take the hit. \u201cHow are you feeling this morning Puny? You know, now all of your lies are gonna unravel. You can\u2019t expect to keep them up now we\u2019re <em>actually</em> going to Stark Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hoisted his bag back up his shoulder. \u201cPiss off Flash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh tough words Parker.\u201d Flash taunted, as the rest of the class slowly tuned into their conversation. Flash revelled in the attention of an audience, chest puffed out as he looked around, grinning widely. Peter was almost surprised the bully wasn\u2019t filming the confrontation for a vlog. \u201cLook. Just give it up now and I might let you off. We all know Stark doesn\u2019t take high schoolers as interns. Tell the truth and we\u2019ll all accept that your pathetic attempt at popularity was just because of your sad little life and move \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThompson! What do you think you\u2019re doing!\u201d Flash jumped back as Mr Harrington walked towards them, a clipboard in his hands. He was tapping his pen against it with impatience, his lips turned downwards as he observed the group.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing Sir!\u201d Flash said quickly, throwing Peter a murderous look before re-joining his friends, hovering a short walk away. They circled up immediately, and Peter could see Flash\u2019s arms waving sporadically, his face making bizarre expressions and the cronies all laughing at what could only be more taunting at Peter\u2019s expense. Peter didn\u2019t know what else he would have expected.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington watched Flash leave, before his eyes rested on Peter, narrowing with suspicion. Peter gulped. Mr Harrington didn\u2019t look away as he addressed Ned and MJ. \u201cLeeds, Jones. Please go line up with the rest of the class, the bus is just coming through the gate. Parker, a word?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned seemed concerned, and backed up only a few steps until MJ grabbed the strap of his backpack and forcibly hauled him across the carpark. Peter turned to face his teacher with dread pooling in his stomach. \u201cYes, Mr Harrington?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington let loose a long sigh. That probably wasn\u2019t a good sign. \u201cPeter. This isn\u2019t going to be a comfortable conversation. I was hoping to avoid it, truly, but after overhearing what Mr Thompson just said\u2026\u201d Peter winced. He felt sick to his stomach, staring up and waiting for his favourite teacher to finish his sentence. \u201cPeter. I think most of the school has heard the rumours that you have an internship at Stark Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes that\u2019s corr\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDespite the fact,\u201d Mr Harrington continued. \u201cThat it is common knowledge Stark Industries do not allow high schoolers to intern for them. In fact, you must have completed your first year of a relevant degree before they will consider an application. And even then they only accept five interns per department per year. It is a highly coveted position.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blanched. He felt the sharp sting of bile at the back of his throat. This was so much worse than anything he could have imagined. \u201cMr Harrington if you\u2019d just let me \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I understand you\u2019ve had a tough couple of years, what with your Uncle passing.\u201d Mr Harrington said, and though Peter knew his teacher was trying to be kind, the words crawled over his skin like ants. A shiver swiftly followed as he tried to dispel the feeling. \u201cBut I cannot allow you to spread these lies. It\u2019s gone on long enough Peter. I understand, I really do, and I won\u2019t force you to confront your classmates. Saying that, I would advise you to come clean sooner rather than later. You don\u2019t want this hanging over your head for the rest of your school days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything. He trained his gaze on the gravel underneath his feet, his sneakers shifting between the stones, unable to look Mr Harrington in the eye. There was a hollowness inside of his chest that felt bottomless. For Flash, his bully, to think he was a liar was one thing. For one of his teachers, one of his <em>favourite</em> teachers, to not think him capable enough to hold an internship, to think him a liar and not allow him to prove his innocence, was crushing. He remained silent.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington shook his head, arms falling to his side, clipboard hanging by his thigh. \u201cPeter I can\u2019t have you saying anything about working for Stark Industries today, is that understood? We are representing the school and if a member of the Stark Industries team were to overhear your lies, and report it, we would be in serious trouble. Do you understand Peter? If you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t let you on the trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter replied, completely monotone. It was eight am and he felt exhausted already. They weren\u2019t even on the bus yet. \u201cI understood, Sir, is that all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington narrowed his eyes further. \u201cI need you to look me in the eye and tell me that Peter, so I <em>know</em> that you understand. No more lies, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pulled his gaze up off the ground, and tried to quell the anger in him. \u201cUnderstood, Sir, is that all?\u201d He repeated, fisting the bottom of his hoodie between his fingers to stop them shaking.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington smiled sadly, seeming on the verge of pity for the teenager. \u201cThank you Peter, that\u2019s all. We will discuss the rest on Monday morning. Go line up with your classmates.\u201d Peter did as he had been instructed, turning on his heel and stalking away.</p>\n<p>Walking towards Ned and MJ, he felt like turning and spitting at Mr Harrington\u2019s feet, the anger in his chest hot like a fire, burning around his ribs like a flame. He took several deep breaths and refused to meet or acknowledge Ned\u2019s troubled expression as they waited to board the bus, only shook his head minutely, and Ned immediately began to glare at Mr Harrington\u2019s back. Peter didn\u2019t deserve Ned\u2019s unending dedication to their friendship. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash and his cronies had pushed to the front of the line and automatically took up the back of the bus. Peter and Ned silently agreed to seat themselves at the very front. MJ sat across from them, and no one dared to ask her to share the two-seater.</p>\n<p>They were still three seats behind Mr Harrington and Mr Warren, on the opposite side, so Ned felt comfortable enough to quietly lean over and ask, \u201cWhat happened? What did he say?\u201d Knowing Peter\u2019s senses could pick up his voice even above the clattering of noise at the back of the bus. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t believe me about the internship. Told me not to spread lies.\u201d Peter muttered, pulling his backpack onto his lap, and collapsing back against the seat, a hand over his eyes but with enough gaps between his fingers that he could see Ned\u2019s mouth pop open in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t say that!\u201d Ned immediately defended, voice raising. At Peter\u2019s hush, he lowered it again. \u201cPeter that\u2019s really out of order. He can\u2019t accuse you of lying without proof. Didn\u2019t Stark Industries register some kind of paperwork with the school when you started the internship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter moved his fingers to rub at his temples. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He admitted. \u201cPepper said she would send something along, to see if I could gain any extra credits for doing additional work, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they have anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like Ms Potts to forget something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hummed in agreement. It didn\u2019t sound like her at all. \u201cWhich means\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe school saw it, but they didn\u2019t believe it was real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Peter and Ned both jumped and stared at MJ, who shrugged, the page of her book held down by her palm. \u201cThe school, I mean, not your idea. Dork is way smart enough to hold an internship like that. They should have at least checked if the paperwork was real, any idiot can do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter felt his chest swell at her words. \u201cThanks MJ.\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ only shrugged again, raised her feet to press against the chair in front of hers, and continued to read. The drive from Queens to the centre of New York City and the location of the Stark Tower dragged by, minute after minute after minute, with Peter and Ned talking under their breath whilst the cackles at the back of the bus never seemed to stop, and only got louder as they finally pulled up to the entrance of Stark Tower.</p>\n<p>As the bus came to a slow stop, and everyone rushed to undo their seatbelts, Mr Warren stood up and held out his hands. \u201cSlow down there boys and girls. Before we go in I just want to remind everyone to be on your very, <em>very</em> best behaviour. This is the big leagues right here guys. One wrong move, you might never be allowed back in. You need to follow everything our guide says, everything the security team says, and for goodness sake don\u2019t touch anything unless given absolutely explicit permission to do so. Am I clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a chorus of \u201cYes Mr Warren!\u201d in return, and they all made their way off the vehicle and onto the hot concrete of the city. Peter had been enough times now to not revel in the sight of Stark Tower the same way his classmates were, but he still admired how impressive it was, a feat of modern architecture only possible for a genius team such as Tony Stark and Pepper Potts.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington led the way inside whilst Mr Warren walked behind the class and made sure no one strayed. Everyone seemed as equally impressed with the lobby, a wide and open space the curled around the reception desks, with light floors and lots of natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling glass windows. \u201cYou can see Ms Potts influence.\u201d Betty was mumbling. \u201cIt\u2019s all so sleek and sophisticated.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>She isn\u2019t wrong</em>, Peter though with a wry smile, <em>if it were up to Tony, the entire place would end up looking like a mechanics\u2019 garage.</em></p>\n<p>Mr Harrington walked confidently up to the receptionist, a kind-looking woman in a black skirt-suit and her blonde hair pinned in a bun at the nape of her neck. <em>Sarah</em>, Peter\u2019s brain reminded him. She had been at Stark Industries for at least three years. They had got chatting the first time he had ever come through the main entrance and they were waiting for Happy to approve of his entry, since he hadn\u2019t had a badge at that point. He\u2019d always made a point to smile at her, and sometimes wave, when he saw her after that.</p>\n<p>Sarah looked up as she saw Mr Harrington approaching, turning away from her conversation with another receptionist. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She asked politely, eying the class hovering behind the teacher. \u201cAre you here for a tour today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are indeed!\u201d Mr Harrington said brightly, bringing out some kind of paperwork to show her. Sarah took it and began to review it meticulously, taking her time to flick through the pages. Mr Harrington grew a little nervous, trying to peer over the desk at the folder. \u201cWe\u2019re, uh, from Midtown Tech? Forrest Hills, Queens? I hope we\u2019re on time \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah snapped the folder shut. \u201cPerfect! Yes we were expecting you at nine am, you\u2019re right on time. If you could just wait here I will retrieve your badges and then escort you to your security briefing.\u201d She passed the folder back to Mr Harrington and walked into the office Peter knew was behind the desks. When she returned, it was with a small box in her hands. \u201cIf your class could each approach one by one, and I will take note of their names and give them each a badge. Are you Mr Harrington or Mr Warren?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah nodded and made a note, presumably ticking off their names on a checklist. \u201cHere you go then.\u201d She said brightly, handing a plain white badge over the desk, hanging on a red lanyard. \u201cAnd Mr Warren I presume?\u201d Mr Warren stepped up, taking his own badge, and hanging the lanyard around his neck. \u201cPlease ensure your students do not take these off at any point, or they will be removed from the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>One by one Peter\u2019s classmates stepped up and accepted their badge, each looking exciting and thanking Sarah profusely. Flash snatched it from her hand with a greedy expression. Sarah only raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>Peter waited until Mr Harrington and Mr Warren were turned away and talking to other students before darting up to Sarah, planting his hands on the desk. Her eyes widened when recognised him, lit with curiosity and confusion. \u201cPeter? What are you doing he\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give me a lanyard cord, but not the badge.\u201d He said quickly. \u201cPlease, just pretend to give me a badge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this your \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah this is my class, I should be on the list, but they don\u2019t really know I work here. Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah\u2019s expression schooled into one of surprise before she plastered the biggest, most professional smile possible onto her face, leaning down to check off his name. At the same time, she covertly snapped a badge off its lanyard and slide the red cord over the desk. \u201cThere you go, all done. Are you excited for the tour?\u201d She continued their conversation amicably, watching the other students whilst Peter brought his own badge out of his pocket, stuffing the gold-coloured cord it had previously been attached to back into his hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuper excited.\u201d He replied, clipping the badge into place, and placing the red cord around his neck. He looked up at the receptionist, relieved. No one had noticed. \u201cThank you, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She whispered conspiratorially, winking. Peter grinned, subtly returning to Ned\u2019s side. \u201cRight, is that everyone?\u201d Sarah called, drawing the class\u2019 attention back to herself. \u201cWonderful. If you will all follow me, our deputy head of security will give you a brief regarding safety whilst within the tower, and then your tour can begin. You\u2019ll need to go through the metal detectors first, so please place your bags in the trays along with your shoes and anything inside of your pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once again, Flash pushed to the front, throwing down his things and ignoring the directions of the security guard waiting by the metal detectors. As there were two, Abe made his way through the other, listening kindly to the advice of the guard, and snickering when the alarm rang out for Flash, and the other boy sheepishly had to remove things from his pockets and be inspected before continuing.</p>\n<p>Peter listened to the guard\u2019s instructions. As he was an employee he would usually go through the fast-tracked entrance, rather than the ones with guards whereby all of your possessions needed to be looked through. He could hear Flash sniggering with his friends. \u201cWhy does Puny Parker have to go through security? He works here right, surely he should be allowed to just breeze past!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned whispered beside him, as they shouldered their bags, \u201cJust ignore him Peter. You\u2019ll get the chance to prove them all wrong, I know you will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore Ned.\u201d Peter said, even though the heat in his chest was beginning to build again, and the red on his cheeks was burning. \u201cI just want to get this whole day over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were shown into a small conference room and took their seats. After a few minutes of waiting, a tall, dark-haired man in a crisp black suit walked in and stood in front of them. Peter had only had a few interactions with Charles Mason, Happy\u2019s deputy, but they seemed similar. Charles certainly never smiled at him either.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, students, teachers. I am Charles Mason, the deputy-head of security here at Stark Tower, and therefore responsible for ensuring each and every one of you is aware of the rules regarding safety during your tour today.\u201d Charles gave the room a hard, sweeping look, his eyes only settling a second too long on Peter. He continued, \u201cThis will include the itinerary of your day, the safety precautions and requirements of each division and department you will be visiting, and a recap of your non-disclose agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles\u2019 stern lecture lasted just over fifteen minutes, and Peter knew that by the end almost everyone in the room was partially scared of the man. At the end, Charles gestured towards a young woman perched on the wall besides the door. \u201cNow, may I introduce your tour guide, Amy Curtis. She will take it from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amy practically bounced to the front of the class. Peter had seen her around, could vaguely recognise her face, but they\u2019d certainly never had a conversation. He didn\u2019t run into the tour guides often, only when they were serving in other capacities. He knew there were only a couple. Stark Industries had drastically cut down on how many tours they allowed through their doors the past couple years. School tours were booked two years in advance. Which only made the fact they were here right now more suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning everyone!\u201d Amy said chirpily. Peter saw several classmates giggle at her childish glee. \u201cHow are we all? Are you excited to begin?\u201d After the general noise of concession amongst the cohort, Amy laughed. \u201cOh dear, has Charles exhausted you already? Come on, let\u2019s get moving, we have a lot to see! First off, the Avengers exhibition! You\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The class scraped back their chairs and followed her from the room, leaving their bags and electronics behind as instructed by Charles. The door was locked behind them and the entire class piled into a large service elevator, all the while with Amy chattering away about each member of the Avengers team who\u2019s exhibit they could expect to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Midtown High School of Science and Technology.\u201d A methodical voice rang out as the elevator doors slid shut. Everyone except for Amy and Peter jumped, Ned twitched but smiled, and MJ looked upwards with disinterest.</p>\n<p>Amy laughed at their expressions. \u201cThat\u2019s F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d She explained. \u201cThe artificial intelligence system Mr Stark personally designed to run the Stark Tower, after the previous AI, JARVIS, was\u2026 well, you can read all about it in the exhibit! Floor eight, please F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy your tour, Midtown.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y said politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe exhibit shows all of the original Avengers, including Mr Stark\u2019s Iron Man at the forefront of course and the history of his father with the creation of Captain America, but also all the members of the team such as War Machine or the Scarlet Witch who have since trained or fought with them.\u201d Amy continued, even whilst some of Peter\u2019s classmates continued to stare at the ceiling of the elevator, trying to decipher where the voice had come from. \u201cThe exhibit is forever growing, that way! Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>They arrived at the correct floor and Amy threw her arms wide. \u201cThere we go! Okay, I\u2019ll do a quick tour all the way through, then the next section on the history of Stark Industries, and then I\u2019ll give you an additional half hour to explore any particular exhibit that interests you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter had been to the Avengers exhibit a couple of times, mostly on boring afternoons when Tony had left him alone in lieu of an emergency meeting and he had a few hours to kill. Still, it was nice to see the additions. Since the reconciliation of the Rogues and those who had been in agreement with the Accords, more information had been added, but Amy wasn\u2019t saying anything he didn\u2019t already know from Tony telling him so.</p>\n<p>\u201cParker, oi, Parker! Why aren\u2019t you telling us all of this eh, since you\u2019re such good friends with Stark? I bet you\u2019ve made Leeds believe you\u2019re mates with the whole Avengers team.\u201d Flash laughed from his place a few metres away. Peter kept walking, ignoring him, though his hands were twisting against his jeans. \u201cHow <em>was </em>dinner with Captain America last night, does he cook well? I always wanted to know!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter knew that Steve Rogers did in fact cook abysmally, having grown up in an early-1900\u2019s and then a war-rationed world, and that the first time he\u2019d tried cooking for the team post the Avengers forming, he\u2019d almost set the kitchen alight. <em>And he\u2019d only been trying to boil rice. </em></p>\n<p>Flash\u2019s cronies, on the other hand, thought the imagine of Peter having dinner with Captain America was the most hilarious thing in the world, and fell apart, laughing hysterically. Mr Warren threw them a terrifyingly dark look once he\u2019d clocked the commotion. The laughing ceased, but Peter could feel Mr Harrington\u2019s eyes sweep over him, lips pulled down in a frown. Peter winced.</p>\n<p>As soon as they were left to explore on their own, Peter and Ned hightailed it to the newest additions to the exhibit \u2013 Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch and Vision. All of the non-original Avengers who fought in what the media had dubbed \u2018the Civil War\u2019. There had been no new information added to Spider-Man\u2019s display, which Peter found vaguely disappointed, but since the rogues had returned and supplied Tony with more information regarding their powers, the others had been updates.</p>\n<p>Ned was fanboying over Wanda\u2019s display when Mr Harrington tapped Peter on the shoulder, a steely look in his eye. Peter sighed. \u201cSir, I know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we understood each other, back at the school, Peter. I asked a very simple request of you.\u201d Mr Harrington interrupted him, tersely.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps you should have also spoken to Flash.\u201d Peter replied hotly, anger bubbling. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to get the same memo.\u201d He turned away from his teacher, furious, and dragged Ned away from the displays in front of them and into an unoccupied corner nearer to the entrance for the History of Stark Industries hallway. \u201cI\u2019m going to scream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d Ned begged immediately. \u201cYou know I have weak ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious Ned. This is <em>awful. </em>Why did I even come.\u201d Peter slumped against the wall in defeat, even as Ned called him dramatic, and they watched as their classmates ran around excitedly, pointing out random facts and giggling and guessing whether they were real or not.</p>\n<p><em>That\u2019s made up</em>, he heard Abe saying, <em>Spider-Man can\u2019t be afraid of spiders!</em></p>\n<p><em>Think again</em>, Peter thought wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna bail.\u201d He said to Ned. \u201cWait till lunch, pretend I ate something bad and feel sick, head home. Mr Harrington will be so relieved he\u2019ll probably let me leave without even trying to call Aunt May.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bail!\u201d Ned squeaked. \u201cBesides, isn\u2019t today a lab day with Mr Stark? And you can\u2019t even get sick anymore so no one\u2019s going to believe that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Harrington doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d Peter pushed himself off the wall and dusted down his jeans, just as Amy called for them to regroup. They followed the sound of her cheery voice, Ned looking devastated.</p>\n<p>Amy clapped her hands together. It seemed to be one of her main forms of communication. Peter couldn\u2019t help but love the enthusiasm she had for her job. \u201cOkay guys, we\u2019re going to do a brief hour-long tour of the building, just a walk around, until we hit midday. You\u2019ll see all the different company departments that don\u2019t involve practical experimentation \u2013 HR, public relations, legal, marketing, etc. Then we\u2019ll go for a half hour lunch\u2026 and this afternoon the exciting stuff happens! That\u2019s right, the lab tours!\u201d</p>\n<p>She beckoned them along, and Peter, having seen all of this before, followed with complete disinterest. Ms Potts had personally given him this tour when he had been officially employed as an intern. Not that he could tell anyone that.</p>\n<p>He did enjoy the public relations office (which, as he already knew, Amy informed them had grown by ten times since Tony Stark revealed himself as Iron Man, and another five times since the forming of the Avengers). Half dealt with company-specific information; the other half dealt with superhero-logistics. Peter mostly enjoyed the space for the snippets of conversation you could overhear. He and Tony had sneaked down here one day and tried to guess what situations the employees were trying to diffuse before they ever reached Pepper\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p>They moved on and Peter couldn\u2019t help but wish he hadn\u2019t left his phone behind. As an employee he would have been allowed to keep it on him, even if his classmates hadn\u2019t. But it wasn\u2019t as if he could explain that to Mr Harrington.</p>\n<p>The hour dragged by, but eventually Amy led them to the cafeteria. Well, it was more of an over-sized food court. There were three throughout the Tower, all situated on different floors to try and quell over-crowding during lunch hours. This particularly floor hosted a McDonalds, a Taco Bell, as well as many smaller, independent stores. Peter had almost convinced Tony to let Delmar\u2019s move in.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington and Mr Warren did a last headcount and instructed them not to stray out sight before everyone fanned out to get there food. They only had half-an-hour until they would be leaving for the lab tours. Peter immediately headed for the hole-in-the-wall Indian place in the corner of the food court, his favourite takeaway during a late-night stint at the Tower. The owner immediately brightened when she spotted Peter walking her way.</p>\n<p>\u201cPete!\u201d She greeted as Peter stepped up to the window. Two chefs waved from the back. \u201cHow are you? What are you doing here in the middle of the day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in the sunlight before!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cHey Aadhya, I\u2019m good thank you, I\u2019m actually on a field trip with my school class.\u201d He jerked a thumb in the direction of his teachers, and Aadhya popped her head further through the window to take a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, school, the good old days.\u201d \u00a0Aadhya grinned. \u201cIs it the usual then? I\u2019ve just put a fresh batch of bhaji\u2019s in the fryer. They\u2019ll be all crisped up, just how you like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah that sounds amazing thanks, but only a half portion of what I usually get, please.\u201d At Aadhya\u2019s curious glance, he clarified. \u201cBig breakfast, and to be honest, I\u2019ll probably be back this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aadhya laughed at the admission, disappearing into the back. Peter leant on the railing and observed the canteen, watching the employee\u2019s go by to see if he knew anyone. It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea. If someone recognised him, Flash would only \u2013</p>\n<p>As if on cue, his senses blared, and a hand shoved his shoulder. Before the spider bite it might have been hard enough to knock him to the floor. Now it barely made him stumble. He made a show of it, anyway, stepping a couple feet forwards as if Flash really did have the strength to move him. He heard the guffaws behind him. \u201cSo how\u2019d you get the lunch lady to pretend to know you Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turned, raising his eyebrows at Flash and the two friends stood behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He said, hoping that Aadhya would return with his food in just a second. In his peripheral, he could see Ned and MJ making their way to the class\u2019 tables with food bags in hand, having stepped away from the Thai place Ned loved to visit.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, just admit this whole thing is a sham. Honestly, I just feel sorry for you at this point.\u201d Flash said, and started to pretend to cry. \u201cOh, oh puny Parker lost his parents and he just can\u2019t cope!\u201d The other classmates roared with laughter. Peter didn\u2019t see the funny side. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve made up this ridiculous lie about knowing Tony Stark, right? To compensate? Honestly could you be more pathetic if you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you just <em>shut up</em>?\u201d Peter snapped, rage boiling up within his chest as he stepped forward and slammed his hand down on the rail he had previously been leaning against. It dented underneath his hand. He went shock still, his entire body shaking.</p>\n<p>Flash stared at him in shock. He tried to recover. \u201cOh so Puny Parker does have a spine\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so goddam sick of yo\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere you go Peter!\u201d Aadhya reappeared at the counter with a wide smile and a brown paper bag filled with all of Peter\u2019s favourite Indian snacks. She froze at the stand-off between the two boys. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter was breathing heavily. He pulled his hand up, trying to re-form the railing he had bent out of place, and then snatched the food off the counter. He gave Aadhya a strained smile. \u201cThank you, Aadhya, I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aadhya wouldn\u2019t take her eyes off Flash for a second, and when she dragged her gaze back to Peter, her look was concerned. \u201cYou too Peter, I put extra sauce in there, just how you like it, and an extra lamb starter. I know it\u2019s your favourite. You have a good tour okay? You know who to call if you need anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, trust me I know.\u201d Peter whispered, and then added, more sincerely. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She winked at him, before turning to Flash and the two boys beside him, who all remained looking shell-shocked at Peter\u2019s shouting at them. Peter heard her snap as he walked away, \u201cWell? Are you going to stand there staring or are you going to order something?\u201d</p>\n<p>He plonked down next to Ned and tore into his food, bringing out the first of the four containers Aadhya had given him and smothering the lamb chapati starter in minted yogurt sauce. Ned stared at him. <em>\u201cDude.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, Ned?\u201d He said, already shovelling the delicious food into his mouth. If he wasn\u2019t so angry, he might have moaned from how good it was.</p>\n<p>Ned shoved his arm, almost causing him to choke, and Peter raised his head in irritation to find half the class stealing glances at him. His cheeks burned red, for what felt like the hundredth time that day. He took another bite of lamb. \u201cWhat the hell did Flash say to you?\u201d Ned asked. \u201cYou never fight back. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m impressed like I\u2019m super impressed like seriously we all saw his face go blank and he definitely deserved whatever you did \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNed, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe made a stupid comment about my parents. Let\u2019s just have our lunch okay. We only have twenty minutes before the tour keeps going. I want this day over as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hacker\u2019s mouth had shut abruptly closed at the mention of Peter\u2019s parents. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said quietly. Peter only shrugged in response, already finished with the first container of food, and bringing out two more. \u201cHey, are these the bhajis you\u2019re always talking about? Can I try one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d Peter shoved the container towards Ned, glad his friend understood.</p>\n<p>They ate the rest of their food in companionable silence. As their time for lunch drew to a close, Peter watched as Amy turned to Mr Warren and tapped her watch. Mr Warren, in turn, said something to Mr Harrington, and Mr Harrington\u2026</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington looked at Peter.</p>\n<p>The teen avoided the stare of his teacher, already knowing where this was going. He tried to distract himself from the sinking feeling inside his stomach, threatening to expel the food he had just ingested. He took up his containers, Ned\u2019s, and MJ\u2019s as well, and made his way to the garbage. If he was about to be chewed out by his teacher for the third time in the same day he\u2019d rather it be away from the rest of the class. Sure enough, Mr Harrington stood from his seat and made his way over to where Peter was shovelling rubbish into the bin.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Mr Harrington said. His tone was low, grave. Peter felt numb, uncaring, even though on most days a tone such as that from his favourite teacher would send him into a spiral. \u201cWould you like to explain to me what your confrontation with Mr Thompson was about earlier? Hm? Over in the corner? Because I just overheard Mr Thompson telling his friends that you were <em>bribing </em>a member of staff to say they knew you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Peter said stiffly. \u201cI was having a conversation with her, you know, being polite. Flash took it the wrong way and decided to use it to try and incriminate me in something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington took of his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cPeter you\u2019re putting me in a very difficult position right now. You know that, don\u2019t you. I saw the way you walked around so disinterested today, as if you were above it all. I don\u2019t\u2026 I just don\u2019t know where this attitude of yours has suddenly come from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all due respect Sir, I have followed all the rules you gave me. I haven\u2019t said a word all day about the internship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have told Flash the truth, right there and then.\u201d Mr Harrington said. \u201cYou chose not to do that. Can you explain that to me Peter, why it is that you let this ridiculous lie you\u2019ve made up continue on in such a way? Do you enjoy the make believe? Does it not give you any kind of stress? You\u2019re a smart kid Peter, a really smart kid. I\u2019m trying to understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter felt tears of anger prick at his eyes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a lie, Sir.\u201d He said very quietly.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington gaped down at Peter for a moment, utterly disbelieving, before his lips pressed into a hard line. \u201cVery well Parker.\u201d He said, quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this. You are, as I said, a smart kid, but you\u2019ve brought this on yourself. I\u2019ll be calling your Aunt to pick you up from the trip early and first thing Monday morning, I will be speaking to the Principal regarding a suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Harrington \u2013\u201d Peter heard the words like ice splintering inside his mind, pure panic spiking in his chest. He began to argue, already regretting standing up for himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said no more lies Parker!\u201d Mr Harrington thundered, his resolve breaking. The entire class sat up like meerkats and stared at them, wide eyed. Mr Harrington could barely keep a class in check on a good day. He never s<em>houted</em>. Peter felt his chin wobble. \u201cSit with your friends whilst I was call your Aunt. To come here, of all places, and tell these <em>fibs</em>\u2026 I\u2019m incredibly disappointed in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter watched, frozen, as Mr Harrington walked away. He felt like he was about to throw up as Mr Harrington clearly recapped the conversation with Mr Warren, and the other teacher only shook his head. Mr Harrington was taking out his phone when Peter finally got his legs to move, walking under the stare of his entire class and Flash\u2019s endless chortles of laughter, back to his table. There was a lump in his throat and his hands were still shaking, the aftermath of his panicking realisation and regret.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d Ned murmured. \u201cI\u2019m so \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t Ned, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter could only choke out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have said something to him \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t, you\u2019ll only get suspended too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You got suspended?! Oh my god what are you going to do this is insane holy sh</em>\u2013<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNed, <em>please</em>.\u201d Peter pleaded. He willed the tears in his eyes to retract. He couldn\u2019t afford to let anyone see him upset. \u201cJust leave it. Mr Harrington\u2019s calling Aunt May to pick me up, I\u2019m not allowed to stay for the rest of the trip. She\u2019s going to so angry I don\u2019t even want to think \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker.\u201d Mr Harrington said from above them. Peter\u2019s head shot up. \u201cYour Aunt is not picking up her phone. Do you have any idea why that may be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter paused, heart thumping. \u201cI, uh, no, no I don\u2019t.\u201d He stuttered, truthfully. \u201cShe was due on shift at the hospital this morning, but she should still have her phone on her. If she\u2019s been drafted into an emergency it will be switched off though. That\u2019s really the only time she\u2019ll ever turn it off completely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington made a huffing sound. \u201cLet me speak to Amy about what we can do with you, then. You\u2019ll simply have to wait downstairs in the lobby for us all to be finished if need be.\u201d He stalked away, motioning to Amy. They stood in a corner, whispering, and then Amy took out a small device that looked similar to a walkie-talkie.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a goddamn disaster.\u201d Peter declared miserably. At least he hadn\u2019t thrown up his food.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d MJ said across from him. Peter lifted up his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, how?\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ shrugged. \u201cThey could have expelled you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gaped at her. \u201cThanks MJ, that\u2019s really helpful. I feel so much better now.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grinned at him, jutting her head as Mr Harrington approached them for the second time, looking frustrated. Peter readied himself for the worst. Mr Harrington came to a firm stop. \u201cAmy has spoken to the security department and they have refused to let you sit in the lobby until such a time as the rest of the class has finished with the tour.\u201d He said, lips still pulled down in an infuriating frown. \u201cThe coach is not returning until four pm and we cannot let you leave the building unattended without your Aunt\u2019s expressed permission. You will therefore be allowed to remain with the class on the tour for the rest of the day, <em>under close supervision</em>, or until such a time as your Aunt returns our call, as is the recommendation of the security team<em>.</em> I don\u2019t want even one more peep out of you, and I\u2019ll still be speaking with the Principal when we return to school. Is that clear, Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mr Harrington.\u201d Peter said, seeing how Ned\u2019s face brightened at the prospect of Peter remaining on the tour.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are in serious trouble young man; I hope you know that. Having to involve the security team in this nonsense means we will almost certainly not be allowed back to Stark Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand, Mr Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you Peter. I thought you were one of our brightest students.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington strode away, motioning to Amy. The tour guide gave Peter a sympathetic look, though her head cocked to the side as if confused. She seemed to shake it off, and called to the rest of the class, \u201cOkay guys, I hope you all enjoyed your lunch. The canteen is a great place for Stark employees to integrate with members of different departments, but they can\u2019t stay here forever! They\u2019ve got work to do! Midtown\u2026 It\u2019s time for the lab tours!\u201d</p>\n<p>The laboratories were on floors ten through seventy, Amy explained. \u201cFloors zero through nine are for entrances, admin, and exhibitions, as well as conference rooms for press statements.\u201d She said, as they climbed into the elevator. \u201cFloors ten through sixty-nine are the labs, ranging in department, expertise, and research or practical focus. Floors seventy through seventy-nine are, as we saw earlier, for marketing and human relations departments etc. Floors eighty through eighty-nine are meeting rooms and offices of high-level employees, such as Ms Potts and the board of directors. There is security on every floor.\u201d The doors of the elevator opened, and Amy strode out, beckoning them down a corridor. \u201cFloors ninety through one hundred, are, of course, the personal floors of Mr Stark and the Avengers team, including their living quarters and personal work spaces. Apparently an entire floor is dedicated to Mr Stark\u2019s personal lab, but I can\u2019t confirm that for certain. No employee is granted access.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter could have confirmed it. Tony\u2019s personal lab on the ninety-third floor, and it was indeed the entire floor, but Tony predominantly remained in the same section. It was used for theory, smaller practical work, or adjustments on the suits or Avengers tech. Peter had his own workstation in there, an entire corner dedicated to the improvement of the Spider-Man suit and whatever other projects Tony deemed suitable to task him with \u2013 just opposite Tony\u2019s own desk, making him the only person in the world allowed to be so close to the genius while he worked.</p>\n<p>But the billionaire-genius-philanthropist also had a second lab in the basement of Stark Tower, where he built the Iron Man Suits and was currently used for all major modifications and testing runs. He split the storage of the now over-forty Iron Man suits between the two spaces. For security reasons, and access during an emergency. He wondered if Amy knew that.</p>\n<p>Peter wasn\u2019t asked, so he didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to have a tour of the biology labs first, then go on up to robotics section of research and development, and then proceed to chemistry and physics. You\u2019ll be able to do some exploring in each, and we have a practical set up for you in robotics and another in chemistry!\u201d Amy\u2019s cheerful disposition, which Peter had admired at the beginning of the day, was grating on him. There was static in his head, the possible beginnings of a sensory overload. He couldn\u2019t wait for the day to be over.</p>\n<p>If he weren\u2019t already in so much trouble, he\u2019d consider sneaking upstairs to Tony\u2019s private living quarters and retrieving the specialised headphones Tony had designed for him. They were going to be marketed for Stark Industries soon enough \u2013 noise-cancelling headphones particularly useful for anyone who suffered sensory overloads or panic attacks.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep walking Parker.\u201d Mr Warren said gruffly from behind him, and Peter startled. That shouldn\u2019t be possible. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna be in any more trouble. Get.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter followed the class into one of the biology labs. The other students were ogling the workspaces with something akin to awe, eyes wide and mouths open (never recommended in a biology lab). Amy reminded them not to touch anything but allowed them to tour the lab, asking questions of the employees who waved and seemed interested in their presence. They were staunchly reminded to leave the others alone. \u201cThis is a place of work, remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash did not seem to receive <em>this</em> memo either. He strode right up to a young intern (Peter didn\u2019t recognise her, but she was wearing a green cord around her neck, which tended to imply the worker was an intern) and began to question her about her work.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Peter heard Flash demanding. He was pointing at the intern\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>Peter watched the intern\u2019s head pop up with surprise. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too busy to talk at the moment. I\u2019m sure there are other employees happy to speak with you.\u201d Her head bowed back down to her work.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only curious about what you were doing.\u201d Flash defended himself.</p>\n<p>The intern\u2019s head turned to the side slightly, looking confused as to why Flash had not yet left her alone. Peter edged closer. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, but I\u2019m very busy. As I said, I\u2019m sure other employees are willing to speak with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat project are you working on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung man, I\u2019ve told you twice that I\u2019m busy, so please return to your class. I am not obligated to explain my work to you.\u201d The intern said, her voice terse. She had begun to look nervous, but was standing her ground.</p>\n<p>Peter looked around. No one else had noticed. Amy was chaperoning a large group of the class, along with Mr Harrington, in a Q&amp;A with a couple of the biology majors. Mr Warren was happily talking to who Peter thought might have been head of the department.</p>\n<p>He made his way over to Flash. The intern eyed him even more warily, clearly worried that he was going to join the other boy in his pestering of her. \u201cFlash, come on man, she\u2019s busy. You heard what Amy said. You gotta leave her alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The intern, Peter could see her lab coat said \u2018Penny\u2019, breathed a visible sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Flash on the other hand, just scoffed. \u201cSod off Parker. Like you\u2019d risk getting into even more trouble today. I\u2019ve practically got you expelled already.\u201d He threw a wicked grin over his shoulder. \u201cServes you right for lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gripped the edge of the work table and promptly let it go again when he remembered what happened to the canteen rail. \u201cJust piss off Flash.\u201d He bit out; teeth gritted. \u201cShe clearly doesn\u2019t want to talk to you. Who would?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you two caused enough trouble today?\u201d Mr Warren appeared at their sides. They both jumped back. \u201cReally, Parker, after everything that\u2019s already happened? Get away from this poor employee, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash stalked off, looking smug, but Penny caught Peter\u2019s arm before he could go. \u201cThank you, for that.\u201d She said warmly. Mr Warren\u2019s eyebrows raised. Peter looked his way, worriedly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he was going to leave me alone.\u201d She looked up at the teacher. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry at\u2026\u201d She trailed off, but looked expectant.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Penny smiled. \u201cHe was only trying to get that other boy to leave me alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Warren snapped his head to the side, but Peter kept his eyes on the floor. He heard Mr Warren clear his throat, the air thick with awkward tension. \u201cRight, well, thank you for that Peter, let\u2019s move along now. We must let the young woman get on with her work. I\u2019m so sorry for the disturbance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, really. Hey, Peter,\u201d Peter turned back around. Penny\u2019s eyebrows were creased. \u201cDo I\u2026 do I know you from somewhere? You look so familiar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Warren made an indignant noise in the back of his throat, shooting Peter a worried look. Peter cut in before the teacher could. \u201cNo, Penny. I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s been nice to meet you though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201d Penny said slowly, still seeming unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was good of you.\u201d Mr Warren murmured as they returned to the group. Peter stood stiffly beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure Mr Harrington knows what you did, it should go in your favour after\u2026\u201d Mr Warren trailed off.</p>\n<p>Peter did not say anything in return. Three employees were lined up at the front of the lab, and Amy was checking her watch. \u201cWell, we aren\u2019t expecting in the robotics labs for a while yet,\u201d She was saying. \u201cSo I was suppose we have a little bit of time for a question and answer session with the whole class!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hands immediately shot up. \u201cLet\u2019s have them introduce themselves first, shall we!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello students, I\u2019m Dr Tarquin, I\u2019m the head of the biology department here at Stark Industries. I oversee all ongoing projects with the help of several supervisors and report them to Mr Stark and the board of directors, whilst also conducting my own research primarily within the field of genetics and specifically it\u2019s relation to medical innovation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr Eden, I\u2019m one of the supervisors working under Dr Tarquin. I help him to manage biological projects under the medical innovation field, and I also supervise the internship programme for the biology department.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I am Dr Marsedon. I have only been here at Stark Industries for two years so I\u2019m still making my way up the ranks! My speciality is medical technology, so I spend my time split between this lab and several others including robotics and development, researching what technology and equipment Stark Industries may bring to the medical field in the next twenty years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amy led the class in clapping for them, Dr Marsedon bowed a little. Dr Eden shook her head at him, but the smile on her face was fond. \u201cPlease, ask us any questions you may have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long did it take for you to progress from employee to supervisor, and from supervisor to the head of department?\u201d Betty cuts in first.</p>\n<p>Dr Eden answers first. \u201cIt took me six years to progress to supervisor, after finishing my initial training years. There\u2019s a lot of tough competition here at Stark Industries. It takes a lot of determination to progress through the ranks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Tarquin nodded. \u201cI completely agree.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I graduated from University with my doctorate. You begin as an entry-level employee, learning the ropes, that\u2019s a three-year course. Then it took me seven years to progress to being a supervisor, another four until I was named a lead researcher, and then an additional eight until I was made head of department. Though, I wouldn\u2019t change any of that experience for the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a twenty-two year wait though!\u201d Flash argued. He looked entirely scandalised. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever think of leaving, going somewhere where you would have been allowed to progress quicker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Tarquin raised an eyebrow. \u201cThere is nowhere better than Stark Industries, young man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash blushed. \u201cRight.\u201d He muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019d wait that long though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Tarquin chose to ignore the comment and continued taking questions, whether that be on application and internship process\u2019 (Peter was shocked Flash managed to keep his mouth shut and not ask about Peter\u2019s internship), Ned\u2019s question on their genetics projects, and MJ\u2019s question on female leadership within a science and technology company.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust look at Ms Potts.\u201d Dr Eden said, ending her speech on the topic, throwing her hands up. \u201cI mean\u2026 What a role model!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d MJ nodded. Peter thought she might actually have been smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight then\u2026 It\u2019s probably best we get to the robotics lab in the research and development facility.\u201d Amy said, looking worriedly at her watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a practical session all set up for you, so we really shouldn\u2019t cut into our time there.\u201d</p>\n<p>They said goodbye to the biology department, and Peter ignored Penny\u2019s curious look as he filtered out of the doors with the rest of his classmates. He snorted when one of them whispered, <em>this place is such a maze. I\u2019d get lost every single day if I worked here!</em></p>\n<p><em>You should see floor forty-five. </em>Peter thought, as Ned babbled at his side. <em>That place is a mess. Tony\u2019s been saying for months it needs to be reconfigured. Maybe that could be my project over spring break\u2026</em></p>\n<p>He let his feet lead him to the robotics labs on instinct, more so than following Amy or the rest of the class. He would often duck into the department for materials and on errands for Tony. Luckily, they had been given an empty space for their practical session and there were no employees who would recognise him here, only two training employees tasked with supervising them. \u201cOkay! There are instructions on the tables, you may work in groups of two or three or by yourself if you would prefer, you may use any materials you can find within the room. Go ahead!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo tell me again what Mr Harrington said.\u201d Ned questioned as soon as they were left to their own devices. He, Peter, and MJ had set themselves up on a steel table at the front of the room \u2013 once again silently agreeing to station themselves as far away from Flash as possible. MJ had joined them without fuss, which Peter found odd (because she so often liked to work alone and had been given the choice too) but wasn\u2019t by any means complaining.</p>\n<p>Peter smiled at the constant protection Ned afforded him. He repeated Mr Harrington\u2019s words, trying to ignore the way they still created a gaping feeling between his ribs. \u201cAnd then he told me I\u2019d be suspended, and I would need to go see the Principal first thing Monday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned was red in the face. \u201cHe\u2019s awful.\u201d He declared, quietly, because Mr Harrington wasn\u2019t stood too far away. \u201cI wish you\u2019d just do what I said and prove to them all that your internship is real. Mr Stark would be so angry to know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is exactly why I\u2019m not including him.\u201d Peter said resolutely.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d want to know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter Ned. I mean, it does, I don\u2019t ever want to keep anything from Mr Stark, but he really doesn\u2019t need to know about this, he\u2019d just worry you know what he\u2019s like.\u201d Peter whispered back. He went to continue \u2013</p>\n<p>MJ smacked the instructions down in front of them. They jumped, staring up at her with surprise. \u201cWe have to build something.\u201d She told them. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it by myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stopped talking. \u201cSorry MJ.\u201d Peter mumbled. \u201cUh, what shall we build?\u201d</p>\n<p>They settled on building a small robot that could dance. They only had an hour after all \u2013 even though Ned\u2019s idea to include voice recognition would have been amazing. MJ and Peter collected their materials and Peter felt his worries about the day slowly melting away with her quiet presence. Moving his hands gave him the clear mind and satisfaction he had been so far from the past few hours.</p>\n<p>Just over half-way through their time, the hairs on the back of Peter\u2019s neck stood up. <em>Nope. No. I don\u2019t need any more of this today. I\u2019m already suspended. Just keep walking just keep walking</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>Flash hovered just behind their table, pretending to look through materials. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for what you did earlier, Puny.\u201d He muttered, loud enough for Peter to hear even without his hearing abilities. \u201cNot that it\u2019s gonna matter come Monday. You remember my Mum\u2019s on the board of directors don\u2019t you. By next week she\u2019ll have turned that suspension into expulsion and I\u2019ll never have to look at your stupid lying face ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never have to look at your scrawny squirrel face ever again. What a miracle.\u201d Peter drawled.</p>\n<p>Ned pressed his lips together to keep from laughing, holding a hand up against his mouth. MJ smirked. Flash went red and in one swift move, turned on his heel and purposefully shoved into Peter, who was holding the almost-assembled robot in his hands.</p>\n<p>If Peter were normal, if he were a regular teenager, he would have gone flying to the floor at Flash propelling his body into Peter\u2019s. That did not happen, but it was enough for Peter to jolt, dropping the robot down onto the table. And because Peter had super-strength \u2013 and no time to moderate what was happening, the robot made a large <em>crash</em>, denting downwards into the steel.</p>\n<p>The robot cracked. A piece of metal sliced down Peter\u2019s arm, drawing blood, not to mention a hiss of pain from between his teeth. The entire class was staring at him again, Ned and MJ were staring at the dent in the table, where their robot lay with a crack splintering down its side, and it took all of Peter\u2019s power to not turn around and <em>throw </em>Flash across the lab.</p>\n<p>\u201cPARKER.\u201d Mr Harrington\u2019s voice thundered. <em>\u201cI leave you alone for five goddamn minutes \u2013\u201d</em></p>\n<p>A low, beeping tone cut through Mr Harrington\u2019s curse.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out protocol has been initiated.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voice sounded out across the room. Peter froze. Mr Harrington jerked his head upwards to look at the ceiling. \u201cAlerting the appropriate authority. Please remain where you are until they have arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree strikes? Authority?\u201d Mr Harrington squawked. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d He turned to Amy; a pleading expression plastered across his face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the behaviour of this student Miss Curtis, I know he\u2019s been a nuisance, but both myself and my colleague will personally escort him off the premises if the rest of the class is allowed to \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>But Amy was suddenly staring at Peter, her eyes narrowed in curiosity rather than anger. Peter stared back, raising an eyebrow. Amy dragged her gaze away, saying slowly. \u201cNo, Mr Harrington I don\u2019t think that will be necessary. We should wait for the appropriate authority to arrive, as F.R.I.D.A.Y stated. Your student would be better off staying here, as would you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe appropriate authority has been alerted.\u201d The AI declared. \u201cThey will arrive in an estimated fifteen minutes, when their meeting has finished. Please remain where you are. The class may continue with their work in the meantime.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a second\u2019s silence, before Amy said, \u201cYou heard the woman, continue your work.\u201d</p>\n<p>The class quickly bowed their heads. Ned looked at Peter, looking pale. \u201cAre you okay dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter heard Mr Harrington and Mr Warren approaching, the sound of their breath, the heavy beating of their hearts, all amplified. He heard F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s announcement in his head. The AI adored him. He would bet his life that it wasn\u2019t his three strikes that were about to be called out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker.\u201d Mr Warren said gravely. \u201cI thought we were past this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was shoved!\u201d Ned immediately tried to defend him. \u201cFlash shoved him!\u201d</p>\n<p>The bully in question had retreated back to his workspace when the AI\u2019s announcement had rung out and was now looking particularly gleeful. His eyes kept flicking to the door, waiting for Charles Mason to stalk through the door and arrest Peter for damaging Stark Industries property.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoving someone would not create this!\u201d Mr Harrington jabbed his finger down on the table in front of them, where MJ had lifted up the robot to examine it, leaving the robot-shaped dent behind. \u201cThis is the work of careless handling of expensive materials. Peter\u2026 Even after everything that\u2019s happened today, you astound me in your recklessness and negligence. This is unacceptable behaviour for anyone, never mind a student already facing suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked up. He could feel like slick slide of blood rolling down his arm, underneath his hoodie, where his teacher could not see. \u201cMr Harrington I didn\u2019t mean to do any damage \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like you didn\u2019t mean to tell lies or bribe a Stark Industries employee or disturb an intern in the biology labs.\u201d Mr Harrington shook his head. Peter went to argue. \u201cEnough, Parker. Sit still and quiet and wait for Mr Mason to arrive, and try to think of ways you can apology to the entirety of your class for your inexcusable behaviour today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stared at his teacher, <em>his former favourite teacher.</em> Wordlessly, he turned away. There was no longer a fire in his chest, only a hollow, empty sort of feeling and a lump in his throat that made him feeling like he might choke. \u201cOkay Sir. I\u2019ll wait for Mr Mason then.\u201d He took the robot from MJ\u2019s hands when she offered it to him. \u201cWe need to find a way to fix the robot.\u201d <em>He had wanted to give it to Mr Stark, but he couldn\u2019t do that with a crack running through it. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t be continuing the practical. Leave the materials on the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone squeaked \u2013 Peter thought it might have been Amy \u2013 as the class turned to gape at the figure leaning against the doorway, his arms crossed, eyebrows raised, and his Armani suit ever so slightly wrinkled. Dark sunglasses were removed by oil-stained fingers and tucked into the V-neck of the man\u2019s t-shirt, leaving his narrowed eyes visibly surveying the class.</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington and Mr Warren had gone white. Flash had gone red. Betty and Abe were gripping each other\u2019s and whispering, \u2018<em>oh my god oh my god oh my god\u2019. </em>Others had either frozen or were practically bouncing in their seats. Flash\u2019s cronies had sat up to get a better look. Ned was staring. MJ was smirking. Peter sighed and continued to fiddle with the robot in his hands, not even bothering to look up. <em>This was just the cherry on top of the cake. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Amy dropped her clipboard with a clutter. Luckily, it landed on the desk next to her and not the floor. Tony turned his head and stared at her, unimpressed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aware that you would be visiting this tour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on it, but I got an alert from a protocol I set up with F.R.I.D.A.Y so I left my meeting early.\u201d The owner of Stark Industries drawled, pushing himself off the doorway. \u201cThought I\u2019d come down and check it out for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour\u2026 Your protocol?\u201d Amy spluttered.</p>\n<p>Tony hummed with agreement, and turned to Mr Harrington and Mr Warren. \u201cI assume you are the two teachers escorting this group of students. Midtown Tech, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington seemed unable to move, so Mr Warren stepped forward, hand outstretched. \u201cYes, yes Mr Stark, I\u2019m Mr Warren and can I just say it\u2019s an absolute honour to meet you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Warren are you aware that one of your students is bleeding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Warren blanched, snapping his hand back. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour student is <em>bleeding.</em>\u201d Tony stressed. \u201cBleeding, as in <em>leaking blood.</em> Were you aware?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Mr Warren stared around the class. \u201cI wasn\u2019t um, how do you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony tutted. <em>Actually tutted, </em>before he directed his gaze past the two teachers as if they had simply ceased to exist. Mr Warren gaped, clearly unsure how to proceed. \u201cYou alright kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Peter replied, monotone, still not looking up from the robot in his hands. He had almost fixed the crack. The eyes of the class snapped from Tony to Peter. Flash\u2019s mouth popped open. Mr Harrington blanched. \u201cJust a scratch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d Tony scoffed. He stepped away from the teachers and strode to the corner of the room, pulling down a first aid kit and making his way over to Peter\u2019s table. He jutted his head at Ned and MJ as he pulled up a stool. He set the first aid kit on the table and opened the lid. Peter didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cArm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you; I was telling you. <em>Arm.</em>\u201d Tony repeated, teeth gritted. Peter held out his left arm. Tony laid it on the table in front of him, gently peeling back Peter\u2019s hoodie to reveal where metal had sliced through skin. Everyone watched with bated breath as Tony examined the wound. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAccident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Tony scoffed again. He took out a wipe from the kit and began to clean away the blood. Peter hissed at the sting. Tony\u2019s grip tightened, keeping Peter\u2019s arm in place, but his voice softened. \u201cSorry kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter murmured. He rested his elbow on the table and propped his chin in his hand, watching Tony clean out the wound. It wasn\u2019t the first time the man had done this for him, they were well past that, but it was the first time Tony had cleaned one of his wounds in the view of other people. Tony didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta disagree with you on that bud, the whole fine thing, you know, considering the blood on your arm and your hoodie and your jeans.\u201d Tony finished cleaning his arm and pointed down at the stain on his edge of his hoodie. \u201cWanna tell me what actually happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you it was an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker do not sass Mr Stark, show some respect.\u201d Mr Warren admonished suddenly, expression shell-shocked, and Peter lifted his head to see Mr Harrington looking two seconds away from his heart failing, totally white in the face. \u201cMr Stark I can only apologise for his behaviour it\u2019s been a troubling day \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to tell me. I already know. My AI has eyes everywhere. She\u2019s been following your tour.\u201d Tony interrupted Mr Warren for the second time. He had begun to wrap Peter\u2019s arm in a bandage. He stuck the edge down with gauze, and inspected his work. He patted Peter\u2019s arm. \u201cAll done kid. Make sure that stays stuck down, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019ve been watching the tour?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome. And yes.\u201d Tony swivelled round on his stool, pushing back slightly so he was in line with Peter, elbows on his knees, fingers clasped under his chin. He raised his eyebrows once again at the two teachers. He pointed. \u201cMr Harrington, I presume?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington seemed to snap out of his comatose state, having watched unbelievingly as Tony bandaged Peter up. Peter almost laughed. \u201cYes, yes that\u2019s correct.\u201d Mr Harrington stood up straighter, holding out a quivering hand for Tony to shake. Tony ignored him. \u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2026 well, very good to meet you, Mr Stark, we\u2019re honoured. Thank you for allowing us to tour your company, it\u2019s been very insightful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d Tony drawled. \u201cMay I ask how you failed to notice one your students was bleeding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington flinched, eyes flickering over Peter. \u201cMr Parker didn\u2019t inform us of an injury \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker should not have to inform you.\u201d Tony interjected. \u201cHe is a minor under your care. You are responsible for his safety and security during school hours and during excursions outside of the classroom such as this. I assume, considering your tone towards him, you were aware of an incident. Did you not think to check he was unhurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony\u2026 don\u2019t do this \u2013\u201d Peter whispered.</p>\n<p>Mr Warren snapped towards him. \u201cPeter! Do not address Mr Stark like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously; his mouth set in a grim line. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have the deciding say over what Peter calls me, Mr Warren.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Stark \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd besides, I\u2019ve been trying to get him to call me that for a year. Don\u2019t ruin it for me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The class froze, as if a sudden artic chill had spread through the room and nailed them to their seats. They stared at Peter, wide-eyed, who grimaced and groaned from his seat next to Tony. Tony smirked a little, nudging Peter\u2019s shoulder with his own before turning his unimpressed look back on Mr Harrington.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Mr Warren spluttered.</p>\n<p>Tony cocked his head. \u201cPeter.\u201d He clarified. If possible, Mr Harrington turned even paler at the falling of Peter\u2019s first name from Tony Stark\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get him to call me Tony for the entire year that I\u2019ve known him, ever since he started working as my personal intern. Took for-bloody-ever. Kid\u2019s a freak about manners, insisted on calling me Mr Stark no matter how many times I complained about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can go back to calling you Mr Stark if you like.\u201d Peter mused, and Tony reached out to ruffle his hair. Peter ignored the stunned looks of his classmates as he leaned into the affectionate gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thank you, mister.\u201d Tony said, a small smile on his face. He curled his fingers and tugged sharply on Peter\u2019s locks, and the young boy let out a small yelp. \u201cAnd if you dare do it again, I\u2019m restricting your lab time by fifty per cent. No more experimentation for you kid, only theory work, for the rest of the month.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You know how close I am to finishing the Polaroid Project!\u201d Peter objected, ducking away from Tony\u2019s clutches.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry may I just \u2013\u201d It was Amy who cut in. Peter and Tony turned to her, pausing their play fighting. Mr Harrington and Mr Warren were staring at them both, horrified expression marring their faces. Peter felt like the weight on his chest had begun to lift. Being around Tony usually did that. \u201cSo\u2026 this young man, he really does work for you Mr Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he does, for months and months now.\u201d Tony chuckled, but Peter could sense the aggravation underneath it. His hand had come to rest on Peter\u2019s back, tugging the younger boy a little closer to him. \u201cBrightest kid I\u2019ve ever met, brighter actually than most <em>anyone </em>I\u2019ve ever met. <em>And</em> as I\u2019ve frequently told him, he happens to be my favourite young adult in the whole world. Not many teenagers have the highest-level clearance provided by Stark Tower. Actually, he\u2019s the only teenager to have that. Huh.\u201d Tony grinned cheekily at Peter. Ned stifled a laugh at the young vigilante\u2019s blush. \u201cGuess I really do like having you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, the protocol? Three strikes and you\u2019re out?\u201d Amy prompted. Mr Harrington seemed seconds away from throwing up. He had changed colour, from white to green. \u201cWe were under the impression that this young man was in trouble for lying, but, if that isn\u2019t the case\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes, that.\u201d Tony said. He directed an unimpressed look at Mr Harrington. \u201cThe protocol wasn\u2019t for Peter. It was for his teachers, and a certain Eugene Thompson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr Harrington choked. He had begun to sway on his feet. Peter briefly wondered whether he was going to faint. \u201cTeachers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree strikes.\u201d Tony held up three fingers. \u201cStrike number one, calling my intern a liar, despite the fact that he\u2019s a good kid who would never do such a thing.\u201d He dropped one of his fingers. \u201cStrike number two, accusing my intern of and threatening to <em>suspend </em>my intern for lying and bribing a staff member, despite the fact he\u2019s a good kid and would never do such a thing.\u201d He dropped another finger, and wiggled the last one in the air. \u201cAnd strike number three, accosting him and accusing him of carelessly damaging Stark Industries property despite the fact <em>he\u2019s a good kid and would never do such a thing.</em>\u201d He dropped the last finger, and held his arms up in the air, a half-shrug. His lips pulled to the side in a show of <em>well, that\u2019s that. </em>\u201cThree strikes, Mr Harrington, Mr Warren, Mr Thompson. You\u2019re out.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a spluttering from the back of the class. Tony swivelled on his seat, spinning around to find Flash at the back of the lab, jaw practically on the floor. \u201cBut\u2026 but \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d Tony said sharply. \u201cMr Thompson you may be a child, but you are also old enough to know better. Despite this, you have been a bully to your classmates, and a nasty one at that. I do not tolerate bullies.\u201d He cast a meaningful look at Peter. \u201cEspecially against this particular kid, who I happen to be <em>rather</em> protective of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Stark \u2013\u201d Flash\u2019s voice was several octaves higher than usual, his eyes bugging from his head as his eyes flickered rapidly between Peter and Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, uh, uh!\u201d Tony refused to let himself be talked over. \u201cMr Thompson you will be allowed to finish the tour with the rest of your classmates, but rest assured you will not be invited back in the near future, so you should look elsewhere for internship and employment opportunities. If you continue to bully Peter, however, please rest assured you will find yourself blacklisted from every college and University in the country and every respectable employer to boot. Don\u2019t test me. Are we clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash gulped, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing nervously. \u201cYes, Mr Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Tony\u2019s stool creaked as he turned back to Mr Harrington and Mr Warren. \u201cAs for yourselves \u2013 as teachers it is your job to create a safe environment for your students. You made grave accusations against Peter with no proof apart from your own assumptions, you made him out to be an instigator when he was in fact the victim, you threatened his education with suspension and let\u2019s just be honest, you\u2019ve treated him goddamn appallingly. I will be in touch with the headmaster of Midtown so rest assured that \u2018meeting\u2019 you were going to try and haul Peter in for on Monday morning, will have a very different tone to what you first thought. Capiche?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCapiche.\u201d Mr Harrington whispered back, as if in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Tony brightened immediately. He turned to Peter with a Cheshire-cat grin spread across his face. \u201cNow, that wasn\u2019t so hard was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter groaned, edging away from his mentor. \u201cYou\u2019re so <em>embarrassing. </em>You were seriously watching us the whole time? You were listening in? Tony that\u2019s so <em>weird?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Tony only laughed, his smile playful and teasing. He stood and pulled Peter into his side, and despite his complaint Peter went willingly, tucked under the billionaire\u2019s arm. The class watching seemed less confused and more bemused at this point. \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m the worst. But May made me promise to look out for you today and intervene if, and only if, things got rough. I think the threat of suspension qualifies as rough kiddo. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m leaving now. What\u2019s this though?\u201d He tapped the bitesize robot in Peter\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey gave us a practical, build anything we wanted. It got cracked though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo bother. Want me to take it to the lab? We can fix it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Peter muttered. \u201cI suppose. Thanks, Tony, for you know, everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looked surprised for a moment, before reaching out to ruffle the kid\u2019s hair again. His go-to action when he wasn\u2019t sure how to express himself. \u201cAnytime, pipsqueak. Always here if you need me. You gonna stay after the tour and join us for dinner? May already said it was alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s cooking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeant to be Rogers, which means we\u2019ll definitely be ordering takeout.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah okay.\u201d Peter scratched the back of his neck, cheeks still a faint pink. He was going to get asked so many questions. He just couldn\u2019t find it in himself to care. He smiled slightly. \u201cTour finishes at four, I have to go get my back from security then I\u2019ll come straight up. You gonna be in the lab?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmazing. Yeah, that leaves us a couple hours to tinker before we eat so head straight there. I\u2019ve got some new ideas for Natasha\u2019s widow bites, could use the assist of my favourite young adult.\u201d Tony stretched his arms and clicked his shoulders. He made his way to the door, holding their dancing robot in his hands, inspecting it as he went. \u201cSee you in a few then, kiddo. Behave, listen, learn, all of that malarkey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalarkey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Sure it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you\u2019ve tried to bambino.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOof, kicking me out of a lab that I built, paid for and own. Harsh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only sorry it didn\u2019t work sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s laugh echoed down the corridor as he ducked out of the lab, departing as suddenly as he had arrived, leaving a stunned class of fifteen-year-olds, two white-in-the-face teachers and one bemused tour guide in his wake. There was silence for a moment. \u201cSo\u2026 So you really do work here then?\u201d Abe said faintly.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. Ned was practically vibrating in his seat. Peter could tell his friend had a hundred and one questions. He really should have asked Tony whether Ned could stay for dinner. Next time, maybe. MJ was watching him curiously. He was surprised she hadn\u2019t taken out her notebook to sketch the entire class, given the looks on their faces. \u201cYep.\u201d He looked up, and couldn\u2019t help but smile feebly at Mr Harrington. \u201cI told you \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d Mr Harrington choked, but didn\u2019t continue.</p>\n<p>Peter shrunk in his seat, awkward under the gaze of his classmates. His confidence was diminishing quickly now that Tony had left the room. He was immensely grateful when Amy clapped her hands together and garnered everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cWell\u2026 I know it\u2019s been a surprising afternoon, but you can happily say you\u2019re one of the only tour groups ever to see Tony Stark in the flesh! He very rarely makes an appearance. We\u2019re out of time on our practical but feel free to take your creations with you. We\u2019ve got a final visit to the chemistry labs and then you\u2019ll all be on your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter trudged out of the lab with Ned and MJ flanking him on either side, both of them teasing him for giving away their robot without their permission. His enhanced hearing still picked up the quiet whispers of the rest of the class.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHoly shit. I can\u2019t believe Puny Parker was telling the truth this whole time.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that! You heard how Stark threatened Flash. He has eyes everywhere\u2026 </em>\n<em>I want to get into Harvard, man.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHe\u2019s the luckiest person in the whole world.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDidn\u2019t Stark say that Rogers was cooking? Peter\u2019s having dinner with Captain America!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhy him?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat makes him so special?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAre we sure this isn\u2019t some kind of a trick, a simulation?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cShut up, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cChrist\u2026 Look at Flash, guy looks like he got hit by a bus. Kinda deserved it, though, don\u2019t you think? He shouldn\u2019t have bullied Parker all these years.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHow do you think they met? Parker and Stark?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cProbably just felt sorry for him.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>They filed into the chemistry labs, and Peter could not help but appreciate how Flash was now avidly keeping his distance, immediately finding the furthest possible seat away from Peter. Ned and MJ seemed to realize that he wasn\u2019t all that interested in the practical work and silently picked up the slack, discussing amongst themselves what they wanted to experiment with. Peter almost regretted his decision to take a backseat when Mr Harrington and Mr Warren walked towards him, wearing identical expressions of regret.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker.\u201d Mr Warren said quietly. \u201cWe wanted to express how incredibly sorry we are. We have treated you, as, uh, Mr Stark quite rightfully said, very badly. We should have believed you from the offset, or at least done our part in listening to your side of the story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes exactly.\u201d Mr Harrington cleared his throat, bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cIncredibly sorry. I\u2026 The way I spoke to you, Peter, and the things that I accused you of\u2026 I\u2019m very sorry. Incredibly sorry. I just never thought it would be possible for\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. He still felt numb. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He murmured, wanting to escape this conversation as soon as possible. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Sir. I get it. It seems crazy. It\u2019s been a year and it still seems crazy to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut clearly Mr Stark has taken a keen interest in you, and I applaud you for that accomplishment. I am sure he will help you go very far indeed.\u201d Mr Warren added. He nodded again, and his teachers retreated, heads bowed together. Peter wondered whether they were worried for their meeting on Monday. He would be if he were them. He continued to fiddle with the items on the desk, trying to keep his hands busy with no real purpose.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was kind of a half-assed apology.\u201d Ned muttered, drawing a small smile from Peter. \u201cYou alright dude? I mean, I wanted everyone to find out but you kinda look like a ghost right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust looking forward to the tour ending.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long. Tony\u2019s presence had extended their time in the robotics department, leaving them with less time to experiment in the chemistry lab. There was some mutterings and complaining but Amy didn\u2019t let it faze her, only reminding them that they\u2019d been privileged enough to see the head of the company, and with a look at Peter slyly reminded everyone about the NDA\u2019s they had signed.</p>\n<p>They were led back downstairs, where Charles Mason was waiting to let them back into the room their bags had been kept in. Peter had just shouldered his backpack, fishing out his phone and checking for notifications when Flash cleared his throat behind him. \u201cHey Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested, Flash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but I wanted to apologise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stilled. He turned slowly on his heel to face Flash; his eyes narrowed with suspicion. Ned and MJ hovered by his side, watching the interaction, ready to jump in should they need to. MJ had her sketchbook tucked under one arm and was tapping her nails against it. Flash fidgeted uncomfortably, wringing his hands together in front of them with his lips pressed together. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash cleared his throat again. \u201cMr Stark was right.\u201d He began, through gritted teeth. \u201cI was a bully and a nasty one. I said things about you and spread rumours and lies that weren\u2019t true. I\u2019m sorry I did that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re only saying this because you\u2019re afraid Tony\u2019s going to stop you getting into MIT.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Flash shrugged. \u201cLook, I was wrong, I\u2019m apologising. Take it or leave it. But I am sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for Flash. He knew exactly what had turned the boy into a bully \u2013 he had an unkind, unpleasant, and often verbally-aggressive father, who had taught Flash his whole life that power was rooted in fear, and fear came from bullying other people. Peter could only hope that this changed Flash for the better. \u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash nodded and turned away, scooping up his bag. Mr Harrington led them out of the room, thanking Amy profusely for her help and hospitality during the day, encouraging the students to do the same. They were walking towards the reception, Peter just getting up the nerve to remind Mr Harrington he wouldn\u2019t be joining them on the coach back to school, when Betty\u2019s voice rang out.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s Mr Stark again!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter perked up, and sure enough Tony was leaning against the desks at reception, having a seemingly pleasant conversation with one of the staff. He spotted the group and bid the woman goodbye, making his way over. He smiled at the class. \u201cHey again everyone.\u201d He greeted, and then winked at Peter. \u201cThought I\u2019d come and collect you myself kid, make sure there was no more trouble.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo trouble.\u201d Peter said, weaving through the class until he came to stand at Tony\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Tony said, a fond look in his eye. He addressed the class, ignoring their stares as he wound an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the interruption earlier, I hear I cut into your time in the chemistry labs. I hope you all still enjoyed the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was great Mr Stark Sir!\u201d Abe gushed immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d One of Flash\u2019s cronies added. The one who wanted to go to Harvard. \u201cYour biology labs are brilliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Tony smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. Now, Mr Harrington, Mr Warren, I\u2019m sure that after the events of the day you won\u2019t mind if I keep Peter with me instead of sending him back on the bus with you. He\u2019d only be coming straight back here to the Tower. Seems a little wasteful, don\u2019t you think?\u201d There was a lilt to his voice that suggested challenge, as if daring the two teachers to disagree with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d Mr Warren conceded immediately. Peter thought Tony might have deflated just a little \u2013 the man did love a challenge. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you on Monday, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see both of us.\u201d Tony corrected. Mr Harrington, who had only just regained the colour in his cheeks, began to pale again. \u201cSay sayonara to your friend\u2019s kiddo, we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shuffled his feet and avoided the eyes of his staring classmates, awkwardly muttering goodbye from beside Tony. Ned strode up and clapped him on the shoulder, MJ smirked at him and held up a hand in goodbye, and luckily the class began to disperse before Tony began to steer him in companionable silence to the private elevator, tucked into the corner of the lobby. There were calls behind them, \u201chave an amazing time Peter, you\u2019re gonna have to tell us all about it on Monday!\u201d from his classmates.</p>\n<p>The elevator doors closed, and Peter let himself fall against the back wall, eyes sliding shut as they were propelled towards the ninety-third floor, groaning loudly. \u201cThank God that\u2019s over.\u201d He muttered, backpack slipping down his arm and hitting the floor with a thump.</p>\n<p>They were quiet for a moment, Peter enjoying the absence of staring classmates for the first time all day. \u201cSo.\u201d Tony said eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo.\u201d Peter echoed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m gonna ask kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the trip?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glanced up. Tony was smirking, his eyes alight with humour, or what probably seemed like humour to those who didn\u2019t know Tony better. There was a lining of hurt in the crow\u2019s-feet by his eyes, a questioning as to why Peter had not trusted him, a wondering of what he might have done wrong. Tony always wanted to be wanted by the people in his life. He wanted to be needed. Peter shuffled closer, pressing himself into his mentor\u2019s side, and was immediately welcomed into the warmth of Tony\u2019s arms. Thoughts of his classmates astonished looks quickly faded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2026 Well, I knew Flash was probably going to act out, do something stupid, or say something. You know, him not believing my internship was real and all.\u201d Peter told him. Tony listened respectively, only humming in agreement. \u201cAnd I knew how you\u2019d feel about that. So I just didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d embarrass you, or get all angry and protective and involved.\u201d Tony chuckled, one hand lifting to scratch the back of his neck, expression sheepish. \u201cI guess I lived up to expectation. Was it, uh, too much, what I did? May made me promise not to go overboard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter thought for a moment. Thought about all the things Tony had said, the way he had bandaged his arm and protected his integrity and defended him bitterly against the people who had doubted him. How he had never thought, even for a second, that Peter would ever do any of the things he had been accused of.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter said honestly. \u201cActually\u2026 It was kinda perfect. Thank you, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Tony <em>beamed</em>. He tucked Peter closer still and pressed a hesitant kiss to the kid\u2019s crown. Peter blushed at the affectionate gesture, it was something Tony had only just started doing with him, and it made him feel warm every single time. \u201cI\u2019m really glad kid, you\u2019d tell me though, right? If I made you uncomfortable? I can always go in and apologise on Monday, swallow my pride and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you, but you didn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t want you to apologise. Are you really going to go into the school on Monday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah I am. Like I\u2019m going to let them get away with the things they said to you, the things they accused you of! They should know better.\u201d Tony shook his head, hands drawing patterns on Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThey\u2019re teachers for god\u2019s sake. I know you don\u2019t like to be called a kid, but you are a minor after all and under their care, they didn\u2019t even notice you bleeding Peter I mean what kind of teacher doesn\u2019t even \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony continued to ramble on, even after the elevator came to a stop at floor ninety-three and the engineer was steering Peter towards their shared workspaces. Peter found himself not minding all that much \u2013 in fact, he didn\u2019t mind at all. Watching Tony get all het up about his wellbeing was making his heart beat just a little bit quicker than before, and his cheeks were definitely a dark shade of red, but it was a far cry better than the hollow feeling he\u2019d experienced earlier.</p>\n<p>His classmates might spend the next few weeks whispering about him, and Mr Harrington and Mr Warren were definitely going to spend the next couple weeks avoiding him, but, Peter supposed, it might just be worth it for the care and the love in Tony\u2019s voice as he described what a good kid Peter was, shook his head at the absurdity of Peter doing anything remotely like what he had been accused of.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd another thing Pete, that Flash kid is a certified pain in the \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Definitely worth it.</p>"
