  "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>I called in sick today, so you guys get two chapters in one day. </p>\n<p>TW: this chapter discusses sexual assault (there's a detailed attempt that's quickly thwarted) as well as cultural self-harm. </p>\n<p>One of the few criticisms I have of the ATLA show is that they never go into Suki's backstory, which is probably why so many people don't like her and think she's \"boring.\" I had to make all of this up, and I hope I did her character justice.</p>\n<p>I ramped up the scope of Zuko's injuries from Azula's lightning. You know, 'cause that scene wasn't angsty enough. :P</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who left such kind comments and kudos! It's really made my week.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Zuko first realizes that something\u2019s wrong when he\u2019s five. Most people around him have really cool, colorful markings. Usually they\u2019re hidden, but sometimes they\u2019re in a spot that\u2019s hard to hide with clothing. One of his servants has two unique, colorful marks on the back of each hand. A guard has three on her upper arm. His mother has one on the back of her neck.</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t have marks. He just has a weird, wrinkled area on the left side of his belly. </p>\n<p>\u201cMommy?\u201d he asks as they\u2019re playing with the turtleducks in the garden. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have any marks?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ursa sucks in a breath. She furtively looks around, making sure no one is listening. She whispers, \u201cYou did have them, sweetheart. They\u2019re your soulmarks. But your father and the Fire Lord thought they were bad for you, so they got rid of them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zuko looks down. He knows by now that both his father and grandfather are always right, and he shouldn\u2019t ever argue with either. It\u2019s a shame, though. He likes the pretty colors. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt means you have a soul family. The most important people in your life you\u2019re ever going to meet.\u201d She whispers in his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but I peeked. You have five of them. I\u2019ll help you find them one day.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko giggles. He loves keeping secrets with his mother. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He first \u201cmeets\u201d one of his soulmates a couple weeks after that. He\u2019s climbing a tree in one of the gardens, even though his mother told him he shouldn\u2019t, and he slips and falls, hitting the ground hard. </p>\n<p>He starts crying, because <em>ow</em>. A servant runs toward him.</p>\n<p>And then the strangest thing happens. He feels a hand. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not visible, and when he tries to touch it, he doesn\u2019t connect with anything. But it\u2019s definitely a hand, as cool as snow from a mountaintop. It gently touches his cheek, and it startles Zuko so much he stops crying and sits upright. The hand stays, soothing his tears. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this racket?\u201d Ozai demands, coming into the garden. The servant, who has just finished looking over Zuko, gives a deep bow. The cool hand has now evolved into a protective hug, kind of like what his mother does with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fell,\u201d Zuko mumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid he break anything?\u201d he asks the servant.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, my prince,\u201d she answers. \u201cHe\u2019s just bruised up.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen stop whining,\u201d Ozai orders. \u201cAnd go change into something presentable. We\u2019re having dinner with your grandfather tonight.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko hurries to obey. The ghost hand disappears. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He asks his mother about it, and she smiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of your soulmates,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever you need help or support, they\u2019ll always be there for you. At least until you meet them in person and forge the bond.\u201d </p>\n<p>He learns later that forging the bond means a quick blood swap, usually through the palms. Both soulmates nick their palms and press them together. Most do this multiple times. </p>\n<p>Why more than once? Well, he learns even later that soul-bonding is a bit like time travel. When you create a soul-bond with someone, you go to, as Ursa said, whenever in time (in the past) they need a soulmate\u2019s help or support. Except the only thing you can touch is your soulmate, and nothing else. Basically, soulmates are like time travelling ghosts. </p>\n<p>Zuko reads as much about soulmates as he can before Ozai finds out and puts a stop to it. \u201cSoulmates make you weak,\u201d he snarls. </p>\n<p>Zuko...disagrees. His soulmates make him feel strong. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Azula starts firebending a year before Zuko. Of course he gets jealous. But at the same time...</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Zuko!\u201d she says, and for the first time, beautiful, golden fire springs from her chubby, four-year-old hands. \u201cI can firebend!\u201d </p>\n<p>And Zuko\u2019s reaction? He grins and cheers, \u201cAwesome!\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He\u2019s honestly not sure where it went wrong after that, between him and Azula. He\u2019ll gladly admit that he\u2019s not the best brother. He gets angry and jealous, lashes out at everyone and anyone nearby. But he also protects, teaches, and lets himself be bossed around by people who are younger than him and don\u2019t want to kill him. </p>\n<p>The fault, as always, probably lies with Ozai. As soon as Azula started firebending, he immediately began favoring her, poisoning her against the world and her family.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s one of Zuko\u2019s first and fondest memories: her so excited to realize she\u2019s bending, and him, though not yet a bender, whole-heartedly encouraging it. It makes him wonder, if Ozai had been a better father, or just hadn\u2019t been around, what the two of them would be like today.</p>\n<p>(And then he meets Katara and Sokka and thinks, <em>Ah. That\u2019s it.</em>)</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Over the years, Zuko interacts a lot with his soulmates. And he names each of them to keep them all straight. </p>\n<p>The first is Snowflake, the one with the cool hands. She (and Zuko doesn\u2019t know <em>how</em> he knows it\u2019s a she, but he does) is always there when he\u2019s hurt or sick, helping bring his temperature down better than any wet rag. She\u2019s also there when he\u2019s emotionally hurt. When Ozai tells him, \u201cYour sister was born lucky. You were lucky to be <em>born</em>,\u201d Snowflake is gripping his shoulder so tight he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s frozen. It\u2019s okay, though. It distracts from the pain in his chest caused by his father\u2019s words. </p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s Feather, so named because his touch is feather-light. He\u2019s always there when Zuko needs to play. Sure, there\u2019s Mai and Ty Lee, and he likes them (especially Mai). But they\u2019re Azula\u2019s friends, first and foremost. And as the years go by, Azula just gets worse and worse. Feather is there to point him to a group of musicians, or a cute animal, or a nifty knick-knack his mom might like. </p>\n<p>Ozai is never there when Zuko successfully completes a kata, or passes his classes, because he doesn\u2019t do it as perfectly as Azula. But Zuko\u2019s soulmate Brother is there. He ruffles Zuko\u2019s hair, puts his arm around his shoulders, and sometimes flicks his ears when Zuko\u2019s being an idiot. Everything Zuko imagines an older brother would do for him. </p>\n<p>Punchy is less of a friendly hand and more of an encouraging fist. She usually only appears when he\u2019s down or failed. Whenever he thinks of just giving up, he\u2019ll feel a punch in the arm, or a harsh tug on his shoulder, like someone\u2019s trying to get him to stand up by chucking a rock at him. So he does, and when he finally gets it right, there will be a gentler, celebratory punch on his arm. </p>\n<p>Guard shows up whenever Zuko\u2019s in danger. She first appears when Zuko is six, on an Ember Island beach with his family. He\u2019s chasing crabs as the waters temporarily recede, and then he feels a hard push at his back, like someone wants him to run. He does, but not fast enough. The massive wave brings him to the ground, and almost sweeps him away. He spends a good chunk of the day coughing up seawater after that, but at least he didn\u2019t drown. </p>\n<p>Between the five of them, hardly a day goes by where Zuko doesn\u2019t interact with at least one soulmate. Ursa gives a sad smile when she hears this, and tries to encourage him to make physical friends in the present. But there\u2019s not a whole lot of opportunity for a homeschooled boy who\u2019s rarely out of the palace. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Cousin Lu Ten is everything Zuko wants to be when he grows up. He\u2019s a brave, strong soldier who goes out to fight earthbenders. Someday, he\u2019ll even be Fire Lord. </p>\n<p>They wrestle a lot, and Zuko shows him the firebending forms he\u2019s working on. \u201cNice,\u201d Lu Ten says. \u201cYour stance is a little off.\u201d He gently corrects his form. </p>\n<p>Later, Zuko will realize that he learns a lot better under Lu Ten\u2014and later, Iroh\u2019s\u2014gentle training, rather than the near-abuse of his usual teachers that Ozai appointed. They have a habit of giving slaps and burns to their students when they screw up. Snowflake and Feather always try to help, but there\u2019s not much they can do about the steadily increasing sense of failure and unworthiness that crushes his chest after every training session.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s eight when Lu Ten leaves for Ba Sing Se with Iroh. Zuko hugs him good-bye. \u201cBe careful.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lu Ten chuckles, patting his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me, little cousin. And I\u2019ll make sure Dad sends you some good souvenirs.\u201d </p>\n<p>He never sees his cousin again.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>About a year after Iroh and Lu Ten leave, Zuko picks up a \u201cdangerous habit,\u201d as Ursa puts it. He calls it a fun game. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s called jumping off of tall shit onto other tall shit. </p>\n<p>Zuko blames a combination of Ty Lee, Feather, and Brother. Ty Lee is constantly teaching them new ways to break their necks, Feather pulls his attention to excellent jumping points, and Brother rewards the behavior with hair ruffles and shoulder-hugs. He\u2019ll take his mother\u2019s scolding for that any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Then Azula decides to join him on an excursion to the roof of their beach house on Ember Island. And really, he should not have turned his back on her. Not for a minute. Guard doesn\u2019t even have time to warn him before Azula pushes him off the edge. </p>\n<p>While physicians are working on Zuko\u2019s sprained ankle, Azula tearfully explains that Zuko simply fell. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s lied. But it\u2019s the first time everyone unanimously believes her over him. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaking wet,\u201d Ursa says, as he storms away from the fountain of giggling girls. </p>\n<p>\u201cGirls are crazy!\u201d he shouts. Brother gives him a sympathizing pat on the back. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Lu Ten is dead. Iroh calls off the siege of Ba Sing Se. Zuko cries himself to sleep that night. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The family of four kneels before Fire Lord Azulon. Azula shows off her advanced bending technique. Zuko tries to one-up her, but fails. Ursa tries to comfort him but can\u2019t stop the weight of <em>not good enough not good enough not good enough</em> from getting that much heavier. </p>\n<p>A furious Azulon orders them out of the throne room, but Ozai stays. Azula suckers Zuko into eavesdropping with her. </p>\n<p>Ozai thinks that Iroh\u2019s new lack of heirs means <em>he</em> should be named crown prince. This makes the frustrated Azulon even angrier, and Zuko flees. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cDad\u2019s going to kill you!\u201d Azula cheers. \u201cReally, he is.\u201d </p>\n<p>He still hears it even after Ursa drags her away, and he tries to drown it out with, \u201cAzula always lies. Azula always lies.\u201d </p>\n<p>They can\u2019t actually defend him, but the weight of his soulmates\u2014all five of them\u2014huddled around him on the bed is what eventually gets him to sleep. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Looking back, Zuko doesn\u2019t think Azulon ever expected Ozai to go through with it. Even if the man burned his baby grandson to get rid of the soulmarks, that doesn\u2019t mean he wanted him <em>dead</em>. That the whole \u201cKill your eldest child\u201d thing was just him trying to prove a point: parents whose children are dead or in danger are put in a terrible position, and should not have their birthrights stolen from them. He probably didn\u2019t think Ozai would hate Zuko enough to actually consider it.</p>\n<p>At least, Zuko likes to think that way about his grandfather. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Ursa disappears. No matter how much Zuko asks, begs, or shouts, everyone pretends she never existed. </p>\n<p>Azulon dies. Ozai is crowned Fire Lord. Zuko finds himself in a position he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d be in: the next crown prince and heir apparent. </p>\n<p>All his life, he\u2019d been told he didn\u2019t matter. And not just by Ozai. Everyone knew that once Azulon died, the throne would pass to Iroh, then his son Lu Ten, then <em>his</em> children. Zuko was never supposed to factor into the picture. But with Lu Ten dead and Iroh disgraced, Zuko is now one of the most important people in the Fire Nation. </p>\n<p>And yet, Ozai still looks at him with nothing but disappointment. </p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d he says as he watches Zuko finish his latest forms. They\u2019re in the courtyard, the sages that have been teaching Zuko watching from the other end of the room. \u201cPerhaps if we\u2019re ever at war with turtleducks, you\u2019d make a worthy ruler.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko winces. Snowflake\u2019s cool touch at his shoulder does little to help. Why can\u2019t he stop failing? Why can\u2019t he be <em>better</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that, brother.\u201d </p>\n<p>Both of them jump, and see Iroh come into the courtyard. </p>\n<p>\u201cIroh?\u201d Ozai asked, bewildered. \u201cYou disappeared. They said you went mad.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJust traveling,\u201d Iroh says with a smile. He bows before his brother. \u201cThe crown suits you, Fire Lord. Thank you for convincing our father to give it to you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d look nearly as good on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even Zuko knows a backhanded compliment when he hears one, and has to bite his tongue. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Ozai asks. </p>\n<p>Iroh pulls out of his bow. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last year traveling the world. I\u2019d say I\u2019m ready to retire, but I believe your war council still has a seat with my name on it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ozai studies him. \u201cI suppose we could use your advise, since you\u2019ve grown too lazy for the field.\u201d </p>\n<p>Iroh laughs. \u201cMore like too old.\u201d He finally turns to his nephew, and his face brightens. \u201cAh, Prince Zuko. You\u2019ve grown so much! You\u2019re taller than I am! And certainly more handsome. Let me see you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko lets himself to be hugged, then examined by his uncle. He has no idea how to react. Iroh has never been cruel to him. Certainly not to the extent that Ozai or Azulon were. But he\u2019s never been very...present in his life, either. Most of the time he was out on the field, leading the troops. When he was home, he was busy with war meetings, boasting to courtiers, and spending time with his own son. </p>\n<p>He was also a lot...trimmer...than he is now. </p>\n<p>This new Iroh, the one who smiles warmly and easily despite having so recently lost a child, who manages to be polite and insulting, and who specifically turns his back on Ozai to give his full attention to Zuko...this Iroh is new. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was watching your form,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad! But there is always room for improvement. And you\u2019re not going to get it with these sages. I\u2019ll take over the rest of the your training.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko blinks. Snowflake squeezes his shoulder, gently. Which means, she\u2019s not mad. This...is a good thing? </p>\n<p><em>Well, he is the Dragon of the West,</em> he reminds himself. </p>\n<p>The head sage sputters, walking up to them and Ozai. \u201cThis is outrageous! It\u2019s tradition for the Fire Sages to train the royal family.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut not mandatory,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cMy nephew deserves the best training he can get.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting that with us,\u201d the sage says. </p>\n<p>Iroh raises an eyebrow. \u201cIs he? Should you and I step into the ring? I\u2019d like to see which of us has the better claim to \u2018Master.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Snowflake has moved, now leaning on Zuko, propping her elbow on his shoulder by the feel of it. She\u2019s enjoying this. So is he. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the sage is smart enough to know that he\u2019ll never win a fight against General Iroh. He gives up the right to train the prince. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko is initially cautious during the first few lessons with Iroh. Every time he makes a mistake\u2014even a minor one\u2014he expects to get a burn, or a smack, or at least some yelling. It\u2019s what crappy students deserve, right?</p>\n<p>It never comes. Iroh never raises a hand to him and never raises his voice. The worst he does is give him a firm scolding, and that\u2019s only when he\u2019s doing something dangerous or not getting the fundamentals through his thick skulls. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026nice. His lessons progress much better under Iroh\u2019s direction. And not just firebending. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to learn a fighting style <em>other</em> than bending?\u201d Zuko asks, incredulous. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food, Prince Zuko?\u201d Iroh asks. \u201cI should know this, but I\u2019m sad to say, I do not.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSpicy noodles with shrimp.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would happen if you had spicy noodles with shrimp every day at every meal?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUh...I\u2019d get sick of it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou would get sick, period,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cThe body is not meant to ingest only one thing, and neither is the mind. We have to expand your horizons. Skills you learn in one area can be surprisingly useful in other areas as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hesitates. \u201cWell...I\u2019ve always kind of liked swords?\u201d </p>\n<p>Iroh smiles. \u201cI know just the place.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko trains with the dao swords under Master Piandao. Ozai disapproves and Azula scoffs, but he clings to this. It\u2019s the one thing that he excels at that Azula does not.</p>\n<p>And Brother is there almost every day, too. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s thirteen, Zuko talks his way into a war meeting. </p>\n<p>That makes it sound like he lied. But he meant every word. He wants to become a good fire lord, so he needs to know this stuff. What happens if Ozai keels over of a heart attack tomorrow? So he gets in, under the condition that he not speak. </p>\n<p>Yeah. Nothing in Zuko\u2019s life is ever that easy. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need the prompting of his soulmates\u2014he\u2019s not even sure who it is that\u2019s prodding him, he\u2019s so angry\u2014to speak out against the general. How dare he?! How can the Fire Nation call themselves people of honor when they\u2019re shamelessly sacrificing the lives of its people as \u201cfresh meat\u201d?</p>\n<p>This is not a popular opinion.</p>\n<p>Ozai growls that Zuko is being extremely disrespectful. Dishonorable, even. And the only way to settle this is with an Agni Kai. </p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord,\u201d Iroh says sharply. \u201cHe\u2019s a child.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the crown prince. And he shouldn\u2019t even be here. The duel will happen tomorrow.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko looks at the general and tells him he\u2019s not afraid. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko is confident even though he knows that\u2019s a solid chance he will not win this. He refuses to let such a horrible order\u2014a horrible <em>person</em>\u2014go unchallenged. So he gets in the ring with his vest and kneels with his back to his opponent. Punchy gives him a good-luck punch in the arm that makes him smile, just a little. </p>\n<p>He stands and turns around. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the general.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Right before Ozai burns him, Zuko feels all of his soulmates act. Guard is trying to pull him back, trying to get him to <em>move</em>. Punchy is trying to get him to stand and defend himself. Brother, Snowflake, and Feather try to protect his face. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s all futile. They can\u2019t protect anything, and Zuko is rooted to the spot. </p>\n<p>He appreciates the effort though. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>In the infirmary, Snowflake becomes his favorite soulmate by letting him use her as a big icepack. As soon as he meets her, he\u2019s getting her a box of candy and flowers (girls like candy and flowers, right?) just for this. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stay long, though. He has three days to get a ship and a crew, and leave the Fire Nation. And since nobody wants to work with a dishonored, disfigured <em>boy</em>, he needs to get to work. </p>\n<p>Lucky for him, he has Iroh. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Two and a half years. </p>\n<p>He spends two and a half years at sea, first searching the Air Nomad Temples, then the poles, then the Earth Kingdom. He trains, with both fire and sword. He yells at his uncle, his crew, at innocent civilians. </p>\n<p>He focuses on nothing but his rage, and his burning desire to regain his honor and go back home. </p>\n<p>Despite the harsh treatment, Iroh never leaves him. Neither do his soulmates. </p>\n<p>Feather is always trying to cheer him up, even just a little. He\u2019ll poke Zuko\u2019s nose until he looks out the window and sees falling snow for the first time in his life. He\u2019ll draw his attention to the dolphin-sharks that follow his ship. He\u2019ll get Zuko to pause in front of a shop that has cute knick-knacks. It rarely works, but even on his worst days, Zuko finds himself softening just a little when it happens. </p>\n<p>Snowflake is always there when Zuko gets hurt. It doesn\u2019t happen very often as he gets better at defending himself and ignoring the hateful sneers. But when he does take a hit, or a cruel word finds its way under his armor, her cool presence is always welcome. </p>\n<p>Brother is absolutely invaluable when it comes to strategy. Not every time, but sometimes, Zuko will feel him trying to push or pull his hand across various maps until he\u2019s settled on a specific place that he wouldn\u2019t have initially thought of. These places rarely have news of the Avatar, but they do have deep ports for his ship, cheap supplies, and a relatively friendly attitude toward Fire Nation princes. </p>\n<p>Punchy moves from hitting him when he needs to get up\u2014he does that on his own, now\u2014to hitting him when she thinks he\u2019s being an idiot. Which is, apparently, every time he:<br>\n\u2022 yells at Iroh<br>\n\u2022 yells at the crew<br>\n\u2022 yells at anyone who isn\u2019t a jerk, really<br>\n(She\u2019s right, of course. But he\u2019ll never admit it.)</p>\n<p>Guard is always watching his back. It doesn\u2019t matter who he\u2019s fighting or what danger he\u2019s in, she will do everything in her power to alert him. From the thugs who try to rob him on the street, to mutinous crewmembers who think the best way for them to go home is to just get rid of their captain, to Earth Kingdom soldiers trying to ambush him. He can usually spot the danger himself, but just the fact that she\u2019s there and invested in him being alive helps.</p>\n<p>Zuko knows that they are most likely in the Fire Nation. Soulmates rarely cross national lines. So he <em>needs</em> to capture the Avatar as soon as possible, so he can find them. </p>\n<p>(Later, he\u2019ll realize that soulmates probably don\u2019t cross national lines so much anymore simply because <em>people</em> don\u2019t cross those lines anymore. And that needs to change.)</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>One day, he\u2019s pondering his maps, when he feels Brother\u2019s hand over his own. </p>\n<p>Zuko closes his eyes and lets his soulmate pick their next destination. When the touch is gone, he opens his eyes. And raises his eyebrow. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a port, or city. It\u2019s the south pole. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>And just like that, it all changes again in an instant. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When the Avatar tricks them and escapes the ship, some of the crew want to go back to the Water Tribe village and burn it to the ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe knew the rules!\u201d Lieutenant Jee argues. \u201cHe comes with us, or the village burns. He needs to pay the debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iroh says nothing. Just watches Zuko and lets him decide. </p>\n<p>And Zuko, unlike most of his other decisions, actually takes a moment to think about it. Because he knows several people\u2014Zhao, Azula, his father\u2014who wouldn\u2019t hesitate. They\u2019d leave nothing but ash and bones in the snow. </p>\n<p>But there are two things holding him back. The first is sheer practicality. Their ship is badly damaged. They need to chase the Avatar. The Avatar flew <em>away</em> from the village. They can\u2019t risk losing his tail just to quench a grudge. </p>\n<p>Secondly...</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are no warriors in that village,\u201d Zuko says, thinking about that stupid boy who barely counts as a fighter and ran off with the Avatar. \u201cNo soldiers. Only old people, mothers, and children half my age. Where is the honor is slaughtering them because a child didn\u2019t keep his promise?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lieutenant Jee sputters. \u201cHe broke his word!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHis lack of honor doesn\u2019t excuse yours,\u201d Zuko snaps. He marches to his chambers. \u201cWe follow the bison. End of discussion.\u201d </p>\n<p>He sees Iroh smiling at him, and feels an approving punch\u2014different from the \u201cyou\u2019re being an idiot\u201d punch\u2014from his soulmate. But the real shocker comes when he\u2019s alone in his chambers. He takes one step and runs into a wall of soulmates. </p>\n<p>At first, Zuko is very confused. He has no idea what\u2019s going on or even how many are with him right now. But after a minute, he figures it out. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s Snowflake\u2014he\u2019d recognize that oasis-like coolness anywhere\u2014and, given the calluses on the hands, Brother. And they\u2019re hugging him. </p>\n<p>He has no idea why. Maybe they\u2019re glad he finally has a solid lead, or that he\u2019s not dead, or they recognize a bad day when they see one. Either way, he closes his eyes and just lets himself enjoy it for a moment. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The next few months are a whirlwind that turn Zuko\u2019s life upside-down several times over. But what most sticks out is this:</p>\n<p>Every time Zuko fights the Avatar and his friends, he does it from a sense of duty. That he has to do this for his nation, for his honor, for his soulmates. But every time he fights <em>with</em> them, it feels oddly...right. When the Avatar asks if they could be friends after the \u201cBlue Spirit\u201d breaks him out of Zhao\u2019s fort, a not insignificant part of Zuko wants to say <em>yes</em>. </p>\n<p>That terrifies him. </p>\n<p>And by now, he\u2019s an expert at channeling his fear into fury, and fire. </p>\n<p>Later, when they\u2019re all there fighting Azula in the ghost town and Iroh takes a bolt of fire to the chest, he wants to say yes again. The waterbender can help. And while they\u2019re his enemies, by now he knows they\u2019re honorable enough to mean it when they say they want to help. </p>\n<p>He bends fire at them to chase them away. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Ba Sing Se happens, and Zuko is more confused than anything else. </p>\n<p>Iroh tells him that it\u2019s time for Zuko to choose his own destiny, to do good in the world. Azula tells him that he can help her topple an empire and regain everything he\u2019s been striving so hard for: his honor, his father\u2019s love, his soulmates. </p>\n<p>But oddly enough, his soulmates...don\u2019t assist him in that decision. </p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been with him every step of the way. Every fight, every injury, every roadblock, at least one of them is there, watching his back, soothing his wounds, giving him some sort of guidance. But in the catacombs of Ba Sing Se, they\u2019re eerily silent. </p>\n<p>He picks Azula, and the Avatar falls. </p>\n<p>(Later, he\u2019ll remember that soulmates only appear when destiny deems that he needs them. But sometimes, he needs to make decisions on his own.)</p>\n<p>That night, Zuko\u2019s side aches and burns. He dismisses it as a muscle cramp or minor injury from the fight. Later, he\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s not unlike the pain of someone\u2019s soulmate getting perilously close to death.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He has his honor. He has his girlfriend. He has his father\u2019s love and even his sister\u2019s approval. </p>\n<p>So why isn\u2019t he happy?</p>\n<p>His soulmates appear from time to time, but it\u2019s not like before. There\u2019s little to nothing that they can do. He tries to talk to Iroh about it, but the man says nothing behind the iron bars. He considers telling Mai, but she doesn\u2019t have soulmates and wouldn\u2019t understand. </p>\n<p>He knows the Avatar is alive. One of the best waterbenders in the world has a vial of spirit water and is quite possibly soulbonded with and/or dating him? Yeah, he\u2019s not dead. Injured and recovering, sure. But not dead.</p>\n<p>And thanks to Azula, if anyone else ever finds out about that, it\u2019s all on Zuko. Everything that he\u2019s worked so hard for will vanish in an instant. </p>\n<p>So Zuko does the only thing he can do and hires an assassin. </p>\n<p>It leaves him with a bad taste in his mouth, and a sore arm from Punchy\u2019s hit. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When Iroh tells him about his link to Roku, Zuko takes that information and ignores it, the way he\u2019s been ignoring everything else: the fate of the Avatar and his friends, the fact that the national rhetoric and propaganda he took as truth so obviously clashes with what he experienced abroad, the growing sea of guilt and hate and anger churning in his stomach. </p>\n<p>This\u2014for the most part\u2014works. </p>\n<p>Right up until the war meeting. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord Sozin used the comet to wipe out the Air Noamds,\u201d Ozai says. \u201cI will use it to wipe out the entire Earth Kingdom. And I will rule everything!\u201d</p>\n<p>The generals cheer. Azula smirks. Zuko wants to throw up. </p>\n<p>His soulmates are at his back, some of them nudging him forward, urging him to speak up. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>He studies the massive portrait of Ozai in the hall, Mai hanging on his arm. And he realizes two things:</p>\n<p>His father is a monster.</p>\n<p>And he has sacrificed everything\u2014his identity, his uncle, his honor\u2014in the name of that monster. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Assisting the Avatar\u2019s invasion would seem like the easiest way to end all of this. Except Zuko can\u2019t. Too much has already gone into preparations. If he tries to change anything, they\u2019ll get suspicious of him and lock him down. </p>\n<p>No, he has to let the eclipse go as planned, and hope that the Avatar and his friends, once again, slip out of the jaws of death. </p>\n<p>So instead, Zuko spends the morning of the eclipse preparing. He writes a break-up letter to Mai, discards his crown and armor, and packs his swords and some food. As the sun grows dark, he heads for the bunker. </p>\n<p>He stands in front of the door that separates him from his father, waiting for the eclipse to officially start. </p>\n<p>Snowflake is gripping his left hand, to the point that his palm is frozen. Feather is holding his right, jittery fingers tapping against him. Punchy is squeezing his forearm, Brother\u2019s hand is on his shoulder, and Guard\u2019s is on his back. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to face you now,\u201d he says, and walks through the door. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He feels like twenty pounds has been lifted from his chest as he walks away from Ozai, even as the man calls him a coward. </p>\n<p>And then...</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what happened to your mother?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko stops. </p>\n<p>Guard, Punchy, and Feather are all trying to push him out the door. And he knows, he knows <em>exactly</em> what Ozai\u2019s doing. </p>\n<p>He turns around anyway. \u201cWhat happened that night?\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>His mother is alive. </p>\n<p>Iroh broke himself out of jail. </p>\n<p>The Avatar and his friends are heading for the Western Air Temple. </p>\n<p>Zuko steals a war balloon and chases after them. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It probably says something about Zuko that his \u201cfuck you\u201d to his abusive father is much, <em>much</em> easier than trying to convince the Avatar\u2019s group that no, he\u2019s really not trying to kill them this time. </p>\n<p>Predictably, it does not go over well. </p>\n<p>Ugh. This would have been so much easier with Iroh.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It gets worse before it gets better. He accidentally burns his only supporter\u2019s feet. </p>\n<p>When he screams at the sky after she leaves, Punchy gives him a sympathetic pat. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Early the next morning, Zuko gives serious consideration to leaving. That\u2019s what they want, and so far all he\u2019s ever done is bring more harm than good. Maybe that\u2019s the only way to make this right. </p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t. Because this is his mess to clean up. And it\u2019s his nation that\u2019s going to destroy the world. He needs to fix this. </p>\n<p>So he resolves to just stay at arm\u2019s length until they decide he\u2019s not a threat. </p>\n<p>His soulmates have other ideas. </p>\n<p>Punchy\u2019s the first the start prodding him. Then Brother, Snowflake, and finally Feather, all urging him to get up. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snaps. </p>\n<p>They push harder. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine! I\u2019m up! I\u2019m up!\u201d He gets to his feet. \u201cNow what, you idiots?\u201d </p>\n<p>They prod him forward. </p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, but he closes his eyes so it\u2019s easier to follow their lead and starts walking. A more cautious man would at least crack open an eye for stray roots or rocks, but Zuko trusts his soulmates more than anyone else. </p>\n<p>He realizes where they\u2019re going and opens his eyes. \u201cReally? Back here?\u201d he asks, looking at the upside-down temple. \u201cRight, because this went over so well last\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He sees the glint of metal. The bald head. The very distinctive tattoos. </p>\n<p>Zuko runs. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Lesson learned: whenever you want to get a group to go from \u201cwe want to murder you\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll tolerate you until you give us an explicit reason to murder you,\u201d just save them from the assassin you hired to kill them and take a dive off a cliff. </p>\n<p>Whatever. Zuko never asked for luck, he just wants results. He\u2019ll take their overly-cautious attitude, midnight threats, and cold shoulders with a smile. He honestly wasn\u2019t expecting anything better. </p>\n<p>Now, if only he could actually firebend...</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s mini-adventure with Aang to the Sun Warriors really drives home how <em>young</em> the kid is. </p>\n<p>When he was chasing them, it didn\u2019t really click that the Avatar was only twelve. He just saw his prey: a dangerous bender who grew more and more powerful every day. </p>\n<p>Now, after only a day of actually...hanging out...with Aang, the fact that this is just an overly-optimistic, unusually wise, actually <em>terrified</em> child smacks Zuko in the face. He\u2019s extremely timid around fire, he\u2019s wary about the traps, and he\u2019s even more scared of Zuko\u2019s father than Zuko was at his age. </p>\n<p>And he has to save the world in two months. </p>\n<p>On the flip side, the first time Aang manages to firebend on his own without burning anybody, his face is one of pure joy and wonder. Zuko will remember that face for the rest of his life. </p>\n<p>The whole thing boils down to Zuko vowing to himself to protect Aang with his dying breath. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cProtect Aang\u201d in Zuko-speak translates to \u201cgrill him with all the training.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph, at least, greatly approves. </p>\n<p>As the week creeps by, Zuko finds himself gradually becoming accepted into the group. He does chores with Teo, Haru, and The Duke. He trains Aang. He asks Sokka why Aang and Katara aren\u2019t dating, because he thought they were an item from day one, and Sokka shouts, \u201cExactly! If I have to watch them make goo-goo eyes at each other after the war, I\u2019m locking them in a closet together.\u201d He gives Toph piggy-back-rides until her feet heal, and even after they heal because she\u2019s a jerk like that. Katara grudgingly accepts his tea with her dinner.</p>\n<p>And he starts having dinner with the group rather than alone in his room. He still sleeps separate from them. Part of it is because, while he\u2019s definitely connected with Aang and probably Toph, he\u2019s still very much an outsider. They\u2019re still awkward around him, sometimes even tense, like they\u2019re waiting for him to attack. </p>\n<p>Which is ridiculous, because even when he was actively chasing them, he was never smart enough to come up with a plan this good. </p>\n<p>The other reason is the nightmares. He used to get them during his exile all the time, and then they tapered off. Now they\u2019re back. Sometimes it\u2019s the old ones\u2014Ozai burning him, his mother crying for help but he can never find her, drowning in darkness while Azula laughs\u2014and sometimes they\u2019re new. Ozai burning Aang features prominently. Uncle Iroh getting hurt or worse, and blaming Zuko. The world burning. </p>\n<p>He usually doesn\u2019t wake up screaming, but it does happen. Better to just stay away and save that mess of a conversation for later. </p>\n<p>But he still has dinner with the group. And it\u2019s during one such meal that the subject of soulmarks comes up. </p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s soulmates haven\u2019t appeared in a long time. Not since they pointed him in the direction of the assassin. He\u2019s a little disturbed by it; he can\u2019t remember a time he\u2019s gone so long without interacting with at least one of them. But at the same time, he doesn\u2019t really need them right now. He\u2019s busy with Aang and the rest of the team, and for the first time in a long time he knows exactly what his purpose is and how to fulfill it.</p>\n<p>Also, he really doesn\u2019t want to explain to his soulmates what a horrible asshole he was until he\u2019s had some time to make up for it.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s in the middle of a joke when he suddenly stops talking and looks down at his hand. Zuko frowns. \u201cSokka?\u201d </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t answer, and starts unraveling the wrapping around his arm and glove. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d Toph says. </p>\n<p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Aang adds. </p>\n<p>Katara smiles at her brother, who\u2019s ignoring them. \u201cYou probably just have a cramp from sparring today.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know, but...\u201d Sokka\u2019s glove finally comes off, revealing a line of soulmarks that starts at the base of his thumb and goes to the inside of his elbow. As Zuko\u2019s sitting right next to him, he has a prime seat, but looks away. Those are private. Sokka studies one of the marks and breathes a sigh of relief. </p>\n<p>At everyone else\u2019s confused looks, Katara explains, \u201cOne of our soulmates is missing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Our\u2019?\u201d Zuko echoes. </p>\n<p>\u201cTwinkle-Toes, Sweetness, the idiot and I are all soulmates,\u201d Toph explains, ignoring Sokka\u2019s protests at his nickname. \u201cWe also have Suki, that\u2019s the girl who\u2019s missing, and a sixth person we haven\u2019t met yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko hums into his bowl of noodles. He\u2019s completely unsurprised that the four of them (plus two others, apparently) are soulmates, considering how close they are and all they\u2019ve been through. Well, maybe the fact that Katara and Sokka are. Siblings are rarely matched, simply because they\u2019re already so close, so destiny rarely has to get involved to keep them together. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have three,\u201d The Duke says, rolling up his sleeve to reveal them. He points to one shaped like a log. \u201cThat\u2019s Pipsqueak. I don\u2019t know who the other two are.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI have four, but they\u2019re on my legs,\u201d Teo says, looking down at his wrapped limbs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone for me,\u201d Haru says with a shrug. </p>\n<p>They all look at Zuko. Maybe it\u2019s just his imagination, but Sokka, Aang, and Toph look like they\u2019re all holding their breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cFive,\u201d he says, hoping to leave it at that. </p>\n<p>Aang leans forward. \u201cCan you show us?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Katara challenges. </p>\n<p>He sighs, and lifts up his shirt, revealing the old scar. \u201cBecause my grandfather burned them off when I was born.\u201d </p>\n<p>Everyone either pales or looks vaguely ill. Zuko tries not to squirm. He\u2019s been half naked in front of a ship full of people and he\u2019s never felt this exposed. </p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps this is a strange question,\u201d Sokka asks, \u201cbut <em>why</em>?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHim, my father, and Azula don\u2019t have soulmates,\u201d he explains, dropping his shirt. \u201cThey think soulbonds make you weak, and the best thing to do is just avoid them altogether.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you have no idea what your marks look like.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko shook his head. \u201cRight after it happened, my mom tried to draw them, so she could show me later and help me find them. But my father found them and destroyed them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSoooo, it\u2019s possible that you <em>have</em> met your soulmates already and just don\u2019t know it?\u201d Sokka asks. </p>\n<p>Zuko flinches. \u201cI sincerely hope not!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Toph asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cJee, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I\u2019ve been a total bastard for most of my life and I really, really don\u2019t want that to be how my soulmates think of me?\u201d He looks at Katara. \u201cIf we\u2019d had another minute in the catacombs, I would have asked you to heal <em>that</em> scar instead of the one on my face.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019d say we did your soulmates a favor,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>Toph whistles. \u201cLow bar, Sugar Queen, even for you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on! How do we know he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not lying,\u201d Toph says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve felt them,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAll of them. So I definitely meet them at some point. I just haven\u2019t met them yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cI have a theory. Zuko, look at these.\u201d </p>\n<p>Since he\u2019s explicitly being asked, Zuko looks. At the base of Sokka\u2019s thumb is a golden fan. Down his arm is a blue Water Tribe-like symbol that probably matches the design of Katara\u2019s necklace, a blue arrow like what\u2019s on Aang\u2019s head, a cloudy eye that looks like Toph\u2019s, and a golden fire symbol. </p>\n<p>\u201cMine\u2019s a boomerang. They have it,\u201d Sokka says, waving his hand at his other soulmates. \u201cNow this one here...\u201d he points to the fire symbol \u201c...looks an awful lot like the Fire Nation insignia, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, except the color\u2019s off,\u201d Zuko says. </p>\n<p>\u201cDoes the fact that it\u2019s gold mean anything to you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs. \u201cThat is the color of the crown. But it could also mean that your sixth is a jeweler, or gold thief, or any number of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s the other thing,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cWe know this guy is a firebender. The heat that his spirit gives off is like a fire pit. Pretty handy when you live in the South Pole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko narrows his eyes and warns, \u201cStop it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying: it all fits. So far every one of our soulmates is helping to end the war, which is what you\u2019re doing. You admitted it yourself that the color matches the royal crown, and you are a prince. And in our line of work, coincidences aren\u2019t exactly a thing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>not</em> your soulmate,\u201d he says, praying that it\u2019s true. Everything that he\u2019d done to them and put them through was horrible enough when inflicted on random people. But if they\u2019re his <em>soulmates</em>? He might as well jump off a cliff right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s really only one way to find out,\u201d Teo says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d Aang cheers, airbending over the fire so he\u2019s sitting cross-legged in front of Zuko. \u201cSokka, do you have a knife?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGuys, come on,\u201d Zuko tries. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook, if it\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cYou\u2019ll still be our teammate. We just...want to make sure.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sighs and watches Aang prick the middle of his palm with the knife Sokka produces. \u201cSo what exactly can I expect here?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if we\u2019re soulmates, there will be a light as soon as we touch blood, and then our spirits will get sent back,\u201d Aang explains. \u201cFor our bodies, this takes only about three seconds. But in our minds, we\u2019ll be going through every moment and event that we are needed, either to intervene in or, in some cases, just something the universe thinks we need to see. It\u2019s kind of random sometimes, honestly. But it\u2019s really cool!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zuko says weakly. Sokka takes the knife from Aang and wipes it on his pants, then hands it to Zuko. He takes it and pricks his palm, but hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Aang,\u201d he says, \u201cAre you sure you want to do this? Because if we are truly soulmates, then what you\u2019re about to see...it\u2019s not going to be pretty. And there are a lot of things I\u2019ve been through that I would really, really rather you not be a part of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang\u2019s exuberant smile slides off his face. He scoots closer. \u201cHonestly Zuko, I\u2019ve never thought your life was...entirely pleasant. But that just means that, if we are soulmates, then you\u2019re really going to need me, need us, to get through it. Right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko feels himself choke up. He swallows it down. \u201cRight,\u201d he mumbles. He takes a deep breath. <em>Please don\u2019t be my soulmate, please don\u2019t be my soulmate.</em> \u201cAll right. Here goes.\u201d </p>\n<p>He holds out his hand. Aang takes it in a firm handshake. And\u2014</p>\n<p>\"Fuck!\" </p>\n<p>When Zuko clasped hands with Aang, there was a light, he blinked, and now he's in the Southern Air Temple. </p>\n<p>And it's <em>filled</em> with monks. </p>\n<p>So. Definitely, undeniably soulmates. </p>\n<p>Great. That\u2019s just fucking great. He is now one of the worst people on the planet. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Wallow in guilt later, dumb-dumb. You have a job to do.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko takes a moment to look around. When he'd come to this temple in the early days of his hunt, it had been well and truly dead. A ghost town. But now, a hundred years prior, it's teaming with life. Old people meditate under trees. People feed bison and lemurs. Airbending kids play in the skies. Nobody sees Zuko. He's effectively invisible. </p>\n<p>He immediately finds Aang. Which is weird, because the kid is a bit younger--maybe nine or ten--and has no tattoos. He blends in perfectly with all the other kids. By rights, Zuko should not have been able to recognize him. Yet Zuko knows him on sight. </p>\n<p>He's sitting behind the reins of a younger, but still formidable, Appa. An older monk is looking up at him. \"Now remember, Aang: go to the eastern temple first. Then the north. I will be waiting for you in the west, and when you get there, you will receive your tattoos.\" </p>\n<p>Aang bobs his head, bubbling with excitement. Zuko realizes that there are a few other kids his age who are also ready to go. But their saddles are empty of adults, holding only supplies. </p>\n<p>Wait. Do these monks expect a bunch of kids to travel around the world <em>on their own</em>?! Even if it's peacetime, that seems really, really dangerous. </p>\n<p>\"The eastern temple expects you in two weeks,\" the old monk continues while Zuko steams. \"A day late, and they will be sending search parties. Follow your map so you reach the checkpoints in the middle.\" </p>\n<p>\"I'll get there a week early!\" Aang cheers. </p>\n<p>Okay, so at least there's some sort of plan in case things go wrong. And he imagines there\u2019s been a lot of preparation in this. Still. These people are really sink-or-swim. Or rather, fly-or-fall. He wants to smack that monk. </p>\n<p>\"Good luck,\" the monk says, bowing. </p>\n<p>\"Bye, Gyasto. Yip yip!\" </p>\n<p>Zuko barely has time to get in the saddle before they're lifting off. Several people cheer. Aang waves until the people are specks. He pats Appa's head. \"Well buddy, just you and me. Our first journey together! Ready to make some new friends?\" </p>\n<p>Appa groans. Aang giggles. \"I know, right? Hey, you think we'll have time to ride the hopping llamas?\" </p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes. Then he wonders why he's here. Aang--in the present, that is--said that Zuko would be taken to points of time where he's either needed most, or that he really needs to see. He tries not to be jealous of the fact that Aang obviously needs him at lot less and a lot later than Zuko needed <em>his</em> soulmates. Unlike the firebender, the kid is a natural at making friends, and had a functional family.</p>\n<p>But Aang doesn't seem to need him right now. And this moment doesn't strike Zuko as particularly critical. But since he has no idea how to skip ahead, he settles down to wait. </p>\n<p>He doesn't have to wait long. A storm brews ahead. It's a small one, small enough that Aang decides to fly above it rather than through it. The problem is, the higher he goes, the colder it gets. </p>\n<p>He shivers, looking back in his saddle. \"Guess I should've brought an extra blanket, huh, bud?\" </p>\n<p>What was it Sokka said? That a soulmate could keep someone warm if they were a firebender? </p>\n<p>Cursing himself for a fool and a dork and not liking this at all--he doesn't do hugs, or <em>cuddles</em>--Zuko sits behind Aang and wraps his arms around him. </p>\n<p>Aang goes rigid, then laughs. It's such a happy, carefree sound. \u201cA firebender! Awesome!\u201d </p>\n<p>He puts a hand on his lower back, probably where his soulmark is. \"Took you long enough. I was getting worried! I've met everyone else. I guess you're just shy, huh?\" He settles deeper into Appa's fur and closes his eyes with a sigh. \"Can't wait to meet you, buddy.\" </p>\n<p>Zuko smiles. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko flickers in and out of Aang's life. Sometimes he warns him of danger, because Aang's always had a knack for getting in trouble. He and his firebending friend Kuzon fight off a few dragon egg thieves and return the egg to the mother; Zuko has to warn him of incoming fireballs three times in that one fight. He and Bumi almost die going down their \"super slide,\" and Zuko has to alert him to the fact that he's about to crash if he doesn't jump out of the carrier. </p>\n<p>The savior of the world, everybody.</p>\n<p>But a solid half of the time seems to be just Zuko keeping Aang warm. He'd find it pointless, but Aang likes talking to his soulmates.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks for coming, buddy,\" Aang says as soon as Zuko's wrapped around him again. He's getting better at this hugging thing. Hopefully he'll be able to look present-Aang in the eye when this is over. \"It's been a rough week. Kuzon's parents won't let him hang out with me. They said some awful things about Air Nomads...\" </p>\n<p>Zuko sucks in a breath. Sozin's propaganda campaign. You can't just order a bunch of people to commit genocide without prepping them first. The clever fire lord spent years feeding his people lies about the other nations, paying particular attention to how horrible and savage the nomads were. They hated their own children, they had no order, no accountability, they were rogues, thieves, et cetera. </p>\n<p>Zuko almost wants Aang to meet Sozin. If only so Zuko could try to bash his ancestor's face in. </p>\n<p>But he can't do that. The only person, the only thing in this time that Zuko can touch or interact with in any way is Aang. So that's what he does. He focuses on keeping the boy warm and reminding him that he's not alone. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They tell Aang he's the Avatar way too soon. Every other Avatar before him got to wait until they were sixteen. But the Air Nomad Elders are right: war is coming. They need Aang to start preparing now. </p>\n<p>Of course, this alienates him from everyone else. Zuko watches with a pang in his chest as Aang is rejected by the very friends he taught the air scooter maneuver to, and he sees a little too much of himself in the crabby elder who only wants to make Aang work and study all the time. At least there's Gyasto. Zuko has grown to really like that man; he reminds him of Iroh. </p>\n<p>Gyatso is called in for a meeting with the other elders. Aang eavesdrops, and Zuko eavesdrops with him. Their blood goes cold when they hear the order, \"You and Aang must be separated.\" </p>\n<p>Aang flies back to his room. Zuko spits curses no one can hear. The kid has literally no one else! Give him a strict training schedule, maybe get him started on basic waterbending so it clicks that he really is the Avatar, but you don't just tear him away from his guardian!</p>\n<p>Aang cries as soon as the door is closed. Zuko sits next to him and leans into him. </p>\n<p>Someone else is there. </p>\n<p>Their hand brushes against Zuko's shoulder, and it shocks him enough that he jerks back a little. The other hand doesn't move from where it's holding Aang. Zuko cautiously returns to his position, and finds that he immediately recognizes who it is: Snowflake. She pats Zuko's shoulder in greeting before shifting back to Aang.</p>\n<p>So, spirit soulmates can interact a little bit with each other even if they're focused on someone else's life. Interesting...</p>\n<p>When Aang's finished crying, he paces for a little bit. Barely touches his dinner. Goes to bed early. </p>\n<p>Or rather, pretends to go to bed early.</p>\n<p>He writes a note and leaves it on his pillow. But then he hesitates. </p>\n<p>Zuko might not have heard the full story, but he knows. He knows exactly what's going to happen. Aang runs away, he gets frozen, the comet comes and his people die. If he doesn't leave <em>now</em>, he'll be dead, too. </p>\n<p>And Zuko will be damned before he lets that happen.</p>\n<p>He puts a hand on Aang's back and pushes him to the window. </p>\n<p>Aang runs away. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko blinks, and the next time he sees Aang, he's in the South Pole. With Katara and Sokka. </p>\n<p>He'd find Sokka's suspicion hilarious if he wasn't dreading what was coming. Maybe he could smack past-him a few times, get him to see sense?</p>\n<p>No such luck. When Aang fights past-Zuko, and spirit-Zuko tries to yank at the ponytail, his hand just passes right through. So all he can do is watch the fight, capture, and escape in boiling silence. </p>\n<p>Past him was a total dick. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The three of them are on Appa, heading for the Southern Air Temple, when Aang gets his first good look at Katara's necklace. His whole face lights up. \"Hey! I have a mark just like that!\" </p>\n<p>\"Huh?\" Katara puts a hand to her throat. </p>\n<p>Aang wiggles out of his shirt, despite vehement protests from the siblings because it's extremely cold out. But Zuko's keeping him warm, so it's fine. Aang shows them his marks. \"See? And Sokka, don't you have a--\"</p>\n<p>\"Boomerang!\" Sokka cheers. \"Those are our marks! We've got the fan, the eye, and the fire, too!\" </p>\n<p>\"You must be the arrow,\" Katara says, and they're all grinning. Aang pulls both of them into a big hug, and Zuko relaxes. Aang might be new to this century, and he might be the last airbender, but he's not alone.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang finds Gyatso's skeleton. </p>\n<p>It's not pretty.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It takes Zuko a moment to remember Kyoshi Island, and when he does, he wants to hit himself. Repeatedly. </p>\n<p>Suki, his last soulmate, is the leader of the Kyoshi warriors. The trio doesn't have time to narrow the golden fan down to her, though. Thanks to Zuko. Who then proceeds to burn said soulmate's village. </p>\n<p>He is, officially, the worst soulmate ever. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang intercepts the map to Sokka and Katara's father and, thinking they'll abandon the quest\u2014abandon <em>him</em>\u2014for it, crumples it up and hides it. </p>\n<p>Zuko sputters, then smacks him over the back of the head. </p>\n<p>\"Oh, shut up,\" Aang snaps. \"They're my soulmates. We need to stick together.\" </p>\n<p>Too bad he can't hear Zuko swearing at him. This damn kid. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang tries to learn firebending too early and burns Katara. </p>\n<p>Zuko knew it would happen. After all, Aang did tell him about it when they accepted him into the group. But still. The sound of Katara\u2019s scream is going to haunt him for a long time. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>At the North Pole, Zuko wishes he could follow Aang into the Spirit World, because this quest to find Tui and La sounds dangerous. But he can\u2019t. </p>\n<p>So instead, when past-Zuko shows up and carries Aang into a blizzard, he just does his best to keep the kid\u2019s body warm.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\"Why aren't you dating?\" Zuko wails, watching Aang and Katara almost-kiss in a cave.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Omashu is Fire Nation. They go to a magic swamp. They meet Toph. Aang learns earthbending. They go to the desert. </p>\n<p>They learn about the eclipse. </p>\n<p>They lose Appa. </p>\n<p>Aang starts ripping into Toph. \"You've never liked Appa. You wanted him gone--\"</p>\n<p>Zuko puts his hand on Aang's forehead, telling him to shut up even as Katara says to calm down. </p>\n<p>Seeing him go into the Avatar State against the desert tribes, that\u2019s just terrifying. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They reunite with Suki at the refugee dock, and she helps them through the Serpent\u2019s Pass. Unfortunately, she can\u2019t stay with them. She has her own duties. </p>\n<p>They make it to Ba Sing Se. </p>\n<p>Zuko would really like to stop now. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang dies. </p>\n<p>Aang <em>actually dies</em> for a few minutes. And it\u2019s all Zuko\u2019s fault. Thank Agni for Katara and her spirit water. </p>\n<p>Zuko is never going to forgive himself for this. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang wakes up on a Fire Nation ship and understandably freaks out. </p>\n<p>It gets worse when he learns the whole world thinks he's dead. </p>\n<p>And then he decides to run away again. </p>\n<p>Zuko tries to stop him, putting a hand on Aang's chest to push him back. Aang does stop, but only for a moment, and only to glare and hiss, \"This is your fault, too! If I hadn't run away, none of this would have happened! I never should've listened to you. And I hope we never meet!\" </p>\n<p>Zuko reels back, and watches Aang struggle to fly away. He can't say he's surprised. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He does as Aang asked, and doesn't touch him through the school, the assassin, or the scams, until the day before the eclipse. The kid isn't sleeping. He's hallucinating. If he doesn't relax right now, he risks getting himself hurt tomorrow. </p>\n<p>The others make him a bed of sheep wool and manage to convince him to get some sleep. But before he does, he sits on the wool and looks down. \"I think I messed up, guys.\" </p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" Katara asks. </p>\n<p>\"...Have you guys had much contact with our sixth?\" </p>\n<p>\"Fire guy?\" Sokka clarifies. \"Uh, yeah. Not that long ago. Why?\" </p>\n<p>Aang winces. \"So, when I ran off from the Fire Nation ship, I kind of blamed him for everything and said I never wanted to meet him, and he hasn't been with me since.\" </p>\n<p>\"But you <em>will</em> meet him. Obviously,\" Sokka says. </p>\n<p>\"Still. I've just been feeling off ever since then. Like, I know he's there, I can feel the heat, but it's like he's trying to avoid me.\" </p>\n<p>Zuko groans. Dammit, he tries doing what they want, and he just messes it up further. He can't win with these guys!</p>\n<p>\"Well, duh,\" Toph says. \"You literally asked him to back off. Look, if you need space, you can ask for space. If you want warm fuzzy cuddles from Sunshine, ask for warm fuzzy cuddles already. We're soulmates. He'll deliver.\" </p>\n<p>Aang rubs his eyes, but manages a smile. \"Okay. Good night, guys.\" </p>\n<p>They leave him to rest. Aang lies down, curling up on his side. He pokes the cotton. \"Uh...fire guy?\" </p>\n<p>Zuko snorts, but that can't be any more ridiculous a name than \"Feather,\" so he answers. He sits behind Aang and puts a hand on his upper arm. </p>\n<p>Aang tenses, and tries to latch on to his hand. Of course, there's nothing for him to grab on to physically, but Zuko doesn't move. </p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry.\" Aang's voice breaks when he speaks. \"You've been an amazing soulmate, and I've just thrown it back in your face. I can't wait to meet you.\" </p>\n<p>Zuko almost laughs. He figures he'll enjoy the delusion while it lasts. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They make a valiant effort on the Day of Black Sun. It's just not enough. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko thinks that he should not have to sit through a repeat of his stuttering, embarrassing first attempt at making nice in the Western Air Temple, but fate makes him go through it again, anyway.</p>\n<p>This time, he gets to listen to their conversation after he leaves. </p>\n<p>\"Aang already has a firebender for a soulmate,\" Sokka points out during their argument. \"We just have to find him.\" </p>\n<p>\"What if we already did?\" Toph asks. \"What if it's Zuko?\" </p>\n<p>Katara barks a laugh. \"You know, I had that same thought in Ba Sing Se. But look what happened! Instead of doing the right thing and helping us, he fought with Azula and brought down the entire Earth Kingdom.\" </p>\n<p>\"Maybe he doesn't <em>know</em> we're his soulmates. I had no idea what my marks looked like until you guys told me.\" </p>\n<p>\"But he's not blind. And they're really obvious,\" Aang says. </p>\n<p>\"Which means, if he is our soulmate, he's chosen to reject the bond,\" Katara adds. \"And I don't know how the Earth Kingdom or the Air Nomads deal with that, but in the Water Tribe, you <em>don't do that</em>. Your bonds are your family!\"</p>\n<p>Toph storms off in a huff.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph comes back with burned feet. They plan on taking Zuko prisoner. As he watches them fight \"Combustion Man\" (really, Sokka?) he idly wonders how that would've gone. Probably very unpleasantly. Though he can't imagine any of them condoning straight-up torture. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko joins the group, fails at firebending, they go see the Masters.</p>\n<p>--<br>--</p>\n<p>Zuko slams back into his body, in the present, holding Aang's hand. He wrenches himself free and is on his feet, pacing the campsite as a slew of swears pour of his mouth. He\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s swearing at: the shock, the universe, or himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s our sixth!\u201d Sokka cheers. Toph whoops. Like it\u2019s something to celebrate. </p>\n<p>\u201cAang?\u201d Katara asks, standing. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko stops his swearing long enough to look at Aang. Where Zuko had gone up, Aang had gone down, collapsing on the ground. Katara kneels over him and is about two seconds from pulling out healing water when he moves, slowly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Toph asks.</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t even know how to begin to answer that one. <em>I\u2019ve just had every single mistake I\u2019ve ever made in my life thrown back at me like a lemon cream pie. Oh, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve emotionally traumatized Aang more than he already was. Who\u2019s next?</em></p>\n<p>Aang pushes himself up to his hands and knees, and Zuko sees enough of his face to confirm: he is definitely crying. </p>\n<p>Zuko thinks <em>nope</em>, and bolts.</p>\n<p>Eventually he finds a quiet corner to sulk in. Zuko gets to a darkened cliff, sits on the edge, and buries his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>Or, tries to. There\u2019s still blood smeared on his palm. He wipes it away and ties a hasty bandage in the dark.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just finished with that when he hears the unmistakable sound of airbending, and then Aang lands next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Aang says, closing his glider and setting it aside. </p>\n<p>Zuko stares down, at the infinite darkness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aang chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ve already apologized a thousand times.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not...\u201d He groans, and his voice cracks: \u201cYou\u2019ve all saved my life and my sanity more times than I can count. I love all of you. And I just...I\u2019ve been horrible. There\u2019s not a single one of you that I haven\u2019t hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t blame you for that\u2014\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>died</em>, Aang!\u201d Zuko roars. \u201cYou died, and if I hadn\u2019t been stupid enough to follow Azula then it never would\u2019ve happened.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aang sighs. He crosses his legs and twists himself so he faces the firebender instead of the cliff. \u201cZuko. Look at me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t turn around, but he does tilt his head and look at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf Azulon hadn\u2019t burned your marks, if you\u2019d known who we were from the start, would you have attacked us?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, without hesitating. </p>\n<p>\u201cEven if your dad ordered you to? If he\u2019d said it was the only way you\u2019d \u2018regain your honor\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko thinks about it. \u201cNo,\u201d he says at length. \u201cIn fact, that might\u2019ve been better. I would\u2019ve realized how horrible he is a lot sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen there you go,\u201d Aang says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t take responsibility for your actions. You should and you have. But you\u2019re not the villain in this. That rests squarely on Ozai and Azula.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko turns back to the cliff. He can\u2019t accept that. </p>\n<p>Aang grabs his chin and pulls. \u201cYou\u2019re our soulmate,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been there for me when I needed you most. I know it usually wasn\u2019t as dramatic as when you needed me, but it was still just as important. And now you\u2019re teaching me firebending. Without you, we wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near ready to fight the Fire Lord. And even if you weren\u2019t a part of our mission, I\u2019d still want to be your friend.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to be friends with <em>everybody</em>,\u201d Zuko complains. </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly the good people. And you are a good person, Zuko. And a great soulmate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pulls away, letting his hair cover his face. The words are chipping away at him, and he knows he\u2019s going to cry. Yet another thing he doesn\u2019t need Aang to see. </p>\n<p>Of course, the kid lives to defy him, and pulls him into a hug. Zuko crumples, and is shaking as he returns it. Aang just holds him tighter, and doesn\u2019t comment on the growing wet spot on his robes. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Aang might brush it off, but Zuko has no idea how to deal with his other soulmates. He sleeps alone in his room per usual and extends the next morning\u2019s firebending practice so he can put off getting breakfast from the main area. </p>\n<p>But his avoidance tactics don\u2019t work when, right before her training with Aang, Toph marches up to him, waving Sokka\u2019s knife in his face. \u201cYou, me, soulbond. Let\u2019s go.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko snatches the knife. \u201cYou\u2019ll stab someone\u2019s eye out with that!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSparky, I throw fifty-pound boulders at people for fun. Now, are we going to do this, or are you going to continue to sulk and complain about the universe?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates. He has a ton of respect for Toph\u2014he\u2019s not an idiot, he knows she\u2019s as tough as her element\u2014but she\u2019s also twelve. And he\u2019s just as unwilling to show her his screwed up childhood as he was with Aang.</p>\n<p>But telling her not to do something is the only surefire way to get her to do it, so he switches tactics.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to wait?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be training with Aang in, like, two minutes.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom what Aang told us, I\u2019m going to be in the mood to beat something up as soon as we\u2019re done.\u201d </p>\n<p>He sputters. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d </p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give us any of the juicy details. Just that you <em>really</em> downplayed the crappiness of your life. Oh, and that the Fire Lord\u2019s planning on literally destroying the world in a few weeks.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko grimaces. \u201cYeah.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph\u2019s not done: \u201cAnd then Katara asked how you knew that, and then Aang explained the meeting, and she got angry and all like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t he try to stop them\u2019 and he said something like, \u2018cause the last time he did that he got his scar, so please shut up and maybe don\u2019t be such a bitch.\u2019 I\u2019m might be paraphrasing, but that\u2019s basically how it went.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko stares at her. \u201cAang defended me against <em>Katara</em>?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJust because he\u2019s stupidly in love with her doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t call her out when she\u2019s being all crabby.\u201d She makes grabby motions with the knife. \u201cNow come on! Time\u2019s a-wasting!\u201d </p>\n<p>He sighs, but surrenders the knife. He doesn\u2019t bother making the cut, just picks at the scab already on his hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Toph says, pricking her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s one for yes, two for no.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabs his hand. </p>\n<p>--<br>--</p>\n<p>When the light clears from his eyes and he sees Toph arguing with her parents, Zuko almost doubles over laughing. </p>\n<p>She looks so cute and pretty, all dolled up in a white, flowing dress with her hair oiled, even some makeup on her face, though she can\u2019t be much older than seven, maybe eight. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s hilarious. </p>\n<p>His humor quickly dissolves when he realizes what they\u2019re arguing about. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I can see fine!\u201d she\u2019s yelling at two equally well-dressed adults. Her parents. \u201cJust not like you!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d her father snaps. \u201cThis is not up for discussion. You will stay on the grounds at all times, where it\u2019s safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>Little Toph storms off. Where she stomps her feet, the earthen ground cracks. Her parents scold her, but she ignores them. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>She tries to explain her sight again, this time to her earthbending master, Wu, a snooty gold-lover. Zuko wants to tear off his beard. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s talking her through breathing exercises. Toph has had enough, and stands up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for ages. Let\u2019s do some actual bending.\u201d </p>\n<p>She\u2019s apparently already started her training with the badger moles, because she gets in a warrior stance and raises some very large rocks. </p>\n<p>Her master slams down his fist, and the rocks are pushed back to earth. \u201cNone of that! You\u2019re not ready.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut Master Wu\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I will decide when you can advance to the next forms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toph pulls on her hair in frustration. Zuko is right there with her. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph runs away and ends up in a cave. She unleashes her anger in a slew of earthbending, throwing and crushing and smashing. It\u2019s chaotic, and she\u2019s only holding back enough to make sure she doesn\u2019t cause a cave-in, but it\u2019s the most out-of-control bending Zuko\u2019s ever seen her do. She finally collapses, throwing her head into her knees.</p>\n<p>Zuko hesitates. Toph\u2019s not like Aang. She doesn\u2019t like people hugging or cuddling her. But she seems so alone right now, and by now Zuko\u2019s gotten better at recognizing when he needs to observe his soulmates\u2019 past and when he needs to act.</p>\n<p>So he puts a hand on her shoulder. </p>\n<p>Toph jumps and gets in a stance. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d </p>\n<p>...has she never had contact with a soulmate?</p>\n<p>Zuko tries again. Toph attacks with earthbending, but the rocks just pass right through him. He stays put. Toph is breathing hard, and scrambles at where he\u2019s touching her shoulder, but obviously doesn\u2019t come in contact with anything. This only makes her panic even more.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when he sees her marks. They\u2019re on her left shoulder blade, usually hidden by her clothes. But she\u2019d run from home wearing only her pajamas, which drape down her back in such a way that leaves her shoulder blades exposed. Zuko finds his mark and touches it, hoping she understands. </p>\n<p>She does, finally going still. \u201cYou\u2019re...my soulmate?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>One for yes, two for no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He taps once. </p>\n<p>She giggles. Zuko almost drops his jaw because he\u2019s never heard her <em>giggle</em>. \u201cYou feel like sunshine.\u201d </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have anything to say to that, so he doesn\u2019t tap. </p>\n<p>Her amusement fades. \u201cEveryone says that I shouldn\u2019t do...anything. That I should just stay home and be safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>He taps her twice, hard. <em>No.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou disagree?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>She smiles. \u201cGood.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>As soon as Toph returns home she\u2019s grounded for running away, but she manages to get them to talk about soulmates. </p>\n<p>\u201cI met one of them today!\u201d she says. \u201cYou said I have five, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Her mother softens. \u201cYes, you do. And that\u2019s good to hear.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCan you tell me what the marks look like? So I can find them?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sputters. He forgets, sometimes, that she\u2019s blind, so of course she can\u2019t actually see the marks. But he\u2019d have thought that someone\u2014especially her own parents\u2014would have told her what they looked like!</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019re ready to leave home,\u201d her mother says. </p>\n<p>Toph\u2019s face falls. She and Zuko both know that means \u201cnever.\u201d </p>\n<p>When her mother bids her goodnight and leaves her bedroom, Zuko touches Toph\u2019s back again. She straightens. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>He puts the tip of his finger on the soulmark that represents him, the golden flame, and traces it. He does it twice before she says, \u201cA circle with squiggles? That\u2019s you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Close enough. He taps once.</p>\n<p>A hand passes through his, and he recognizes it as Brother\u2019s. (Sokka\u2019s?) Toph stiffens at this new touch, but in seconds, she grins. \u201cThat feels like a corner. Or half of a square.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aang\u2019s arrow is the only one she gets completely right. The others: Katara\u2019s \u201csquiggles\u201d and Suki\u2019s \u201chalf-circle,\u201d well, it\u2019s close enough. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph, Zuko realizes, is a lot like him growing up. She\u2019s lonely. And she needs her soulmates.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a different kind of poison from what he was fed. His father went out of his way to hurt him, tear him down and turn him into the perfect little puppet. Toph\u2019s parents go out of their way to shield her from the world. They have good intentions, but it means that Toph has no friends. She\u2019s completely isolated and alone.</p>\n<p>So Zuko is there a lot. Way more than he was with Aang. He flits through her days, only able to be there a few minutes at a time. He hopes it\u2019s enough. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph continues her secret, underground training. Zuko finds himself helping her. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s good, especially considering the fact that she\u2019s self-taught. But her stances are off. They\u2019re too loose, too casual, not solid enough. She tries to clear a cavern hall filled with loose stone, but can only make a dent. </p>\n<p>It takes some trial an error, but after a bit of prodding, Zuko manages to get her to widen her stance, lower her body, and straighten her back, until it\u2019s much closer to the forms she uses as a master. </p>\n<p>She tries to clear the hall again, and this time she\u2019s successful. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you an earthbender?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cShame. You\u2019d be good at it.\u201d </p>\n<p>High praise. Zuko almost glows. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>She asks Zuko a lot of questions, trying to figure out who he is. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you a bender?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNot earth, though. Water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Fire?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t firebenders supposed to be evil, or whatever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBut a lot of them are bad.\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c...I guess a lot of earthbenders are bad, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans suck, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cAre your parents as bad as mine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hesitates. <em>No. Yes.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUm...one parent is good, one parent is bad?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your mom the bad one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No!</em>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you rich, like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh. If the war ends when I\u2019m an adult, my parents might marry me off to you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>No!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re gonna hurt my feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When Toph is ten, she runs away again, and wanders the city. She managed to get her hands on one of the servant\u2019s outfits, so she blends right in. Around noon, she overhears a conversation about earthbender fighting and follows it to Earth Rumble Six. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s like an Agni Kai, but with earthbending, and solely for the purposes of entertainment rather than settling matters of honor. (Or corporal punishment for children.) Toph watches the fights, looking like she\u2019s struck gold. </p>\n<p>The reigning champion is a middle-aged woman who goes by the moniker Bitch. Literally. Her opponents have to get a lot more creative with their insults. She\u2019s a solid wall of muscle and attitude. Zuko\u2019s pretty sure Toph is in love. </p>\n<p>At the end, the emcee jumps into the ring with a bag of money. \u201cI have two hundred gold pieces for anyone who can defeat the Bitch.\u201d </p>\n<p>Crickets. Nobody is that stupid. </p>\n<p>Except Toph. She jumps right into the ring. \u201cI will!\u201d </p>\n<p>The emcee stares. Bitch turns away. \u201cI don\u2019t fight kids. Never mind blind ones.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph glares, and earthbends a rock right at Bitch\u2019s head, smacking into the back of her skull. </p>\n<p>The crowd Ooooo\u2019s. The emcee hastily jumps back onto his perch, and Bitch slowly turns around. \u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph smirks and gets into her stance. </p>\n<p>Bitch shrugs. \u201cAll right.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph loses. </p>\n<p>Oh, she gives the champion a run for her money. The fight lasts almost a whole four minutes, which is a <em>very</em> long time to be attacking, defending, and dodging a single opponent. </p>\n<p>But, for all of her raw skill and self-taught lessons, it\u2019s still Toph\u2019s first fight, and Bitch is a master. Toph attacks and leaves an opening for half a second. Bitch takes it, and one well-placed rock later, Toph is thrown out of the ring, crashing into the ground. </p>\n<p>She groans, leaning back against the floor. She\u2019s got a few cuts and a lot of bruises, though Bitch was very careful not to break any bones. </p>\n<p>Zuko waits a little bit, then takes Toph\u2019s arm and pulls, trying to get her up. He\u2019s pretty sure Snowflake (Katara? Or maybe Suki) is cooling the bump on her forehead, but she needs to get on her feet. </p>\n<p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she groans, pulling her arm away. </p>\n<p>Zuko growls. So she lost a fight. Boo-hoo. She needs to learn to get back up and brush herself off. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s pulling on her again when Bitch drops down in front of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cToph,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot gonna lie, Toph: you did really good.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph blinks. \u201cI lost.\u201d </p>\n<p>Bitch shrugs. \u201cEveryone loses their first fight. I lost my first twenty. You know the difference between champions and losers? Champions keep getting up.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph stares after her as she walks away. Zuko pulls her arm again. </p>\n<p>She gets up. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph fights in every Earth Rumble Six after that. She always challenges the champion, and loses a lot. Zuko pulls her to her feet every time. She gets laughed at, mocked, ordered to go home. She grits her teeth and shows up again and again. </p>\n<p>Finally, she starts winning. </p>\n<p>Not every match. First it\u2019s one in roughly five. Then one in four. Three. Two. </p>\n<p>Finally, she\u2019s asked to be a standard fighter. </p>\n<p>They ask for a name. She tells them, \u201cBlind Bandit.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The first time she loses in over a year, it\u2019s to Aang. </p>\n<p>She leaves the fight pissed, and is even more pissed when he follows her home. She starts a food fight with him at dinner, and then goes to her room to change and sulk. </p>\n<p>Zuko gives her a moment, then starts pushing her to the door. </p>\n<p>By now she knows him pretty well, so even with minimal touching, she gets it right on the first try: \u201cYou want me to talk to them?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew that! I oughtta punt them out of the city!\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko runs a hand through his hair, trying to think. Through the white fabric of her nightgown, he can see her soulmarks. </p>\n<p>It gives him an idea. He quickly locates Aang\u2019s, Sokka\u2019s, and Katara\u2019s, and touches all of them. </p>\n<p>Toph stiffens. \u201cDo that again.\u201d </p>\n<p>He does, slowly. When she groans, he knows she understands. </p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d she says, walking out of her bedroom to call a truce. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cMy daughter is blind. She is blind and tiny and helpless and <em>fragile</em>. She cannot help you!\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko nudges Toph, away from her father, toward her soulmates. Because he\u2019s had enough of this nonsense. </p>\n<p>So has she. She pulls free of her father\u2019s grasp and says, \u201cYes. I can.\u201d </p>\n<p>Watching her beat the crap out of all those earthbenders is the most fun Zuko\u2019s had in a long time. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve let you have far to much freedom! From now on, you will be cared for and guarded twenty-four/seven.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut, Dad!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for your own good, Toph.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re my soulmates!\u201d she snaps.</p>\n<p>Everyone freezes. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d her father demands. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have five of them. And one of them, Sunshine, he told me,\u201d Toph says. \u201cI\u2019ll prove it.\u201d She pulls at her dress, despite her parents\u2019 protests for her modesty, to reveal the marks on her shoulder blade. </p>\n<p>\u201cCloudy eye!\u201d Aang exclaims. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we missed that!\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka quickly undoes his glove and steps up next to Toph so he can show her parents the match. \u201cAang and Katara match, too. Looks like the universe is sending a pretty strong message here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph\u2019s father grits his teeth. \u201cAbsolutely not. I refuse to let my daughter get involved in your insane quests! Escort the Avatar out. He\u2019s no longer welcome in our home.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka is pushed back. The trio leaves with little resistance. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Toph,\u201d Aang calls. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. Good-bye, Aang.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph knocks out the guard and runs away. Zuko\u2019s only surprised she didn\u2019t do it sooner. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Of course, they get into a huge argument, and she leaves the group almost immediately after joining it. Despite Zuko trying to stop her, she walks right through him.</p>\n<p>Only to run into Iroh. </p>\n<p>Zuko stiffens, watching his uncle make her tea and talk. </p>\n<p>His head is spinning. He had no idea these two knew each other. </p>\n<p>It hurts, seeing his uncle like this. Back when he risked so much to try to help Zuko, not knowing where he would end up. He\u2019s glad when Toph leaves.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Toph can\u2019t see in the desert. So when the library starts sinking, and the sandbenders come for Appa, there\u2019s very little she can do. </p>\n<p>Zuko tries to help, anyway, tries to help her figure out which direction the thieves are coming from. But it\u2019s no good. Even if that worked, she still has to hold up the library. Still has to decide between her soulmates and her friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Appa,\u201d she says, her voice breaking. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Serpent\u2019s Pass, the Drill (\u201cI can\u2019t bend in there!\u201d Zuko snorts. <em>Not yet.</em>), getting Appa back, breaking into the palace, getting the letter...</p>\n<p>Getting kidnapped. </p>\n<p>\u201cQuit your banging!\u201d Chit Tsu yells, slamming his fist against the cage. \u201cYou may think you\u2019re the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can\u2019t bend metal.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph rests a hand against the metal. Zuko nudges her forward. She takes a deep breath and resumes pounding on the metal walls.</p>\n<p>Finally, she either hits hard enough or concentrates hard enough that she finds the tiny specks of earth that have been reforged over and over and over. She smirks. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When the team regroups with the Water Tribe warriors, get Aang settled, and plan their next move, Zuko gets to see Hakoda for the first time. </p>\n<p>The man very obviously cares about his kids, and goes a little pasty when he sees Aang\u2019s injuries. He and Sokka put their heads together and make a plan to steal one Fire Navy ship in order to blend in.</p>\n<p>While everyone\u2019s eating on the dock of said ship, dressed in Fire Nation reds, Hakoda turns to Toph. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t believe I caught your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Sokka gasps. \u201cSo, Dad, this is Toph. Toph, there\u2019s one tiny little detail Katara and I forgot to mention about our tribe.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean besides the fact that your favorite snack tastes like metal?\u201d she asks, chomping into some seal jerky. </p>\n<p>Hakoda doesn\u2019t take insult to this, just chuckles. \u201cIt is an acquired taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust dip it in the soup,\u201d Katara suggests. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about soulmates,\u201d Sokka says. And now Hakoda\u2019s looking at Toph with a lot more interest. \u201cSo, in the Water Tribe, soulmates are basically considered your brothers and sisters. Unless you\u2019re dating them, obviously. But in any case, the parents of one soulmate pretty much adopt all the others. So, congrats! You\u2019re part Water Tribe.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m not calling anyone \u2018Dad.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Hakoda smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that to happen right off the bat, or ever, if you\u2019re not comfortable with it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my <em>actual</em> dad tried to \u2018protect\u2019 me because he thought I was helpless and never let me go outside.\u201d </p>\n<p>He makes a face. \u201cToph, this morning I saw you <em>metalbend</em> several Fire Nation soldiers\u2019 armors and then chuck them into the sea. If anyone here is dumb enough to call you \u2018helpless,\u2019 they deserve the same treatment.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph laughs. And that\u2019s settled.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>After that, the only time Toph arguably needs Zuko\u2019s help is when she\u2019s an emotional mess and does all those scams, becoming \u201cThe Runaway.\u201d But Sokka\u2019s already on it. </p>\n<p>But then, the night before the eclipse, when everyone else is asleep, she turns over. \u201cSunshine? Suki? You there?\u201d </p>\n<p><em>Yes.</em> He feels Guard brush against his fingers. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie: I\u2019m a little scared for tomorrow. You think...you think you can be there with me?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He goes through the eclipse again. His hand never leaves Toph\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>--<br>--</p>\n<p>Zuko wishes that destiny let him warn Toph ahead of time not to sneak up on past-him in the middle of the night, but after the eclipse, that\u2019s it. He blinks, and he\u2019s back in the present, holding Toph\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>She lets go, first. Then punches him in the arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he snaps. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I show affection,\u201d she says. \u201cThis can\u2019t be news to you. You literally named me after that.\u201d </p>\n<p>She hands him the knife, and walks away. \u201cGive that back to Sokka, would ya? I\u2019m going to make a statue of Fire Lord Asshole and throw rocks at it with Aang.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko snorts, but does as he\u2019s been asked.</p>\n<p>He finds Sokka sharpening his sword in the main area and gives him the knife. Sokka studies it. \u201cSo...you wanna...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Zuko says, dropping next to him. \u201cThis is exhausting.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I feel you.\u201d He sheathes the knife. \u201cWanna spar? I could use some practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>And since Zuko has nothing better to do, he agrees. </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s pretty damn good with the blade. Zuko only just manages to win with his dao swords, to much whining. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is so unfair! You can be good at firebending <em>or</em> swordbending, but not both!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSwordbending?\u201d Zuko echoes. \u201cAll right, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re not allowed to come up with anymore names.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Sokka asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cTwo words: Wang Fire. I can\u2019t believe the headmaster fell for that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka strokes his chin like he has a beard. \u201cIt\u2019s not the content of the lie. It\u2019s the delivery.\u201d He sheaths his sword. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re one to talk. I hear you\u2019ve come up with some pretty ridiculous names as well.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko blushes. \u201cI have the excuse of being a child when I came up with them!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot telling.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on! I\u2019m gonna find out eventually.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSure. But not right now,\u201d Zuko says smugly.</p>\n<p>Sokka groans, but doesn\u2019t push. Instead he says, with big, watery eyes, \u201cKatara\u2019s making me do laundry today. Help a soulmate out?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, but agrees.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>A few days pass. Everyone\u2019s acting differently around Zuko, but it\u2019s mostly a good different. Aang and Toph are looser around him. Before the soulmate reveal, they barely knew him. Now it\u2019s like they\u2019ve known him his whole life, because overnight, they have. And Zuko understands them a lot better now, too. Once he\u2019s matched Feather with Aang and Punchy with Toph, it\u2019s easier to let his guard down a bit and relax. </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s also gradually warming up to him. Zuko suspects it has more to do with his unquenchable desire to crack fire, ex-bad guy, and soulmate jokes every four minutes, but it works. Even though they haven\u2019t actually done the soulbond yet, you\u2019d never guess from the way Sokka treats him: throwing his arm around Zuko\u2019s shoulder as they forage or explore the temple, cracking jokes at his expense while ruffling his hair, even unashamedly using him as a heating pad during cold evenings. </p>\n<p>(Zuko felt incredibly awkward the first time Sokka plopped his head on his stomach with a sigh, but when Sokka asked him if he wanted him to move, Zuko said no. He liked the closeness, liked feeling needed. Important. Even if it was just to keep a slight chill away. It was almost enough to convince him to sleep with the rest of the group, but\u2026yeah. Still not ready for that. Also, the nightmares are still a thing. He\u2019s lucky to get five or six hours a night.)</p>\n<p>Then one evenings, while Zuko is handing out tea, Sokka asks to talk to him for a second. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d Zuko asks, when they\u2019re out of earshot of the others. He\u2019s expecting Sokka to ask him to soulbond. </p>\n<p>But, no. Sokka asks about Fire Nation prisons. </p>\n<p>\u2026why couldn\u2019t it have been soulbonds?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t do the bond during the ten-hour hot air balloon ride to the Boiling Rock, either. </p>\n<p>Zuko very hesitantly asks, \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause by not doing it now, we\u2019re basically guaranteeing that we\u2019re both going to survive this,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cThink about it: we both grew up with the other\u2019s spirit from the future watching over us, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>At Zuko\u2019s slow nod, Sokka continues, \u201cSo, if we wait until after we break my dad out of prison, then we\u2019re essentially guaranteeing that this mission will be successful. Because there\u2019s no way the universe is going to let us die <em>before</em> we soulbond. It\u2019s kind of a cosmic protection.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut if you push it too far, then eventually one of us <em>does</em> die before we bond,\u201d Zuko points out. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is why we should do it on our way back,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cJust...humor me on this one, okay? It\u2019d make me feel better knowing for sure that we\u2019ll both make it back even if I fail again.\u201d </p>\n<p>And what else can Zuko do but agree?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko hates to be the bearer of bad news, but he makes himself say it: \u201cI asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. I\u2019m afraid your father\u2019s not here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka collapses against the wall in front of him. \u201cSo we came all this way for nothing? I failed. Again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUgh. What would Uncle say?\u201d Because Zuko hates to see him like this. Whenever Zuko was chasing the group around the world, every time he saw Sokka\u2014the non-bender, the one he naively thought of as the weakest\u2014the warrior was always smirking, plotting, finding some way to fight back. It got to the point where Zuko saw him as just as powerful and determined as the Avatar. Seeing him now, utterly defeated, breaks something in Zuko\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p>So he spouts out some crap about clouds that he thinks is supposed to mean <em>there\u2019s always a silver lining to a bad situation</em>, and when he\u2019s done, Sokka jumps to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s Suki!\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t recognize his final soulmate\u2014story of his life\u2014without her makeup. That makes him sound really shallow, but it\u2019s the truth. </p>\n<p>After he\u2019s discovered and taken as a prisoner, Sokka tells him where the three of them are going to meet, and he finds himself mopping next to her. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good. You guys have met,\u201d Sokka says. </p>\n<p>\u201cActually, he and I met a long time ago,\u201d Suki says testily. </p>\n<p>Zuko winces. \u201cYeah...sorry about that. Is your village okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>She blinks, like she\u2019s surprised he even asked. \u201cYeah, actually. There weren\u2019t any casualties, and all the damage was repaired within a couple of months. So now you\u2019re on our side?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m teaching Aang firebending.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat made you decide to do that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe short version?\u201d Zuko asks, making sure no one\u2019s listening. \u201cTurns out we\u2019re soulmates.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki blinks again. She looks to Sokka, and at his nod, she shrugs. \u201cOkay then.\u201d </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s that. </p>\n<p>They make a plan, other prisoners get involved, and Zuko finds himself freezing in a cooler. Thank Iroh for breath of fire. </p>\n<p>Then Sokka comes to get him, and they overhear the other guards. </p>\n<p>\u201c...some war prisoners. Though I did hear there might be a pirate!\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka looks stricken. </p>\n<p>\u201cWar prisoners. Could be your father,\u201d Zuko says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d </p>\n<p>And Zuko asks him what they should do. It\u2019s less about the fact that it\u2019s his father they\u2019re talking about and more the fact that he now trusts Sokka. Maybe it\u2019s the soulmate thing, or maybe it\u2019s just because by now he knows that Sokka will always come up with the best possible plan. </p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean Zuko has to go along with that plan quietly. He questions it as they\u2019re getting ready to leave, and hears the utter defeat in Sokka\u2019s voice when he says, \u201cMaybe sometimes it\u2019s just better to quit before you fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is the <em>stupidest</em> thing Zuko has ever heard.</p>\n<p>So he talks Sokka into staying. And is unsurprised when Suki agrees to stay with them. Because soulmates don\u2019t let soulmates break their dads out of prison alone.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Seeing Mai again...really sucks. Especially when she reads his break-up letter to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cStop!\u201d he orders. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you! This is about the Fire Nation.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Zuko,\u201d she says, throwing the letter at his head. \u201cThat\u2019s makes me feel all better.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and stands. \u201cThey\u2019re my soulmates.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mai blinks. The soulmate thing has always been a prickly subject between them. Mai doesn\u2019t have any. Zuko would die for his. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho are \u2018they\u2019?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>Zuko snorts. \u201cWho do you think? The Avatar and his friends.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re choosing them over me. Is that it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was them when I left,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now that I do know, I don\u2019t want to choose. I don\u2019t think I should. I love you, I love them, I love our country. And I need to save all of them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSave it? You\u2019re <em>betraying</em> your country!\u201d she snaps. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When they do finally get Hakoda, Chit Sang, and the warden onto the gondola (and Zuko makes a mental note to never pick a serious fight with Suki again; that was terrifying), who else should show up to ruin it all but his sister?</p>\n<p>The three of them get on top to fight them off. Sokka and Zuko find themselves pitted against Azula. </p>\n<p>Suki watches their backs. </p>\n<p>It feels right.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until they\u2019ve stolen Azula\u2019s airship and are several miles away from the Boiling Rock that they all breathe a sigh of relief. </p>\n<p>Most of them start to relax. Not Zuko. Not only can he never relax so soon after a fight, but this airship is designed to be run by firebenders. He and Chit Sang take shifts keeping the fire in the ship\u2019s belly running. It wouldn\u2019t do to die in a crash so soon after escaping prison. </p>\n<p>At one point during his shift, Sokka comes down. \u201cHey. Dad\u2019s at the helm. Suki and I are about to go to sleep.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Zuko says. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo...you should probably get some sleep, too?\u201d Sokka tries. </p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cI never sleep after a fight. Too wired.\u201d And he\u2019s been burned too many times. Too many people waiting to strike. He can\u2019t ever let his guard down until he\u2019s truly safe. He\u2019s also pretty sure he\u2019s going to get some bad nightmares as soon as he closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>Also, he can\u2019t stop thinking about Mai. </p>\n<p>Mostly, he can\u2019t stop thinking about Mai. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep when we\u2019re back at the Temple,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept, like, at all,\u201d Sokka argues. </p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs. </p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cFine. Well...\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou got the knife?\u201d Zuko asks on a whim. </p>\n<p>Sokka pauses, then smiles. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>--<br>--</p>\n<p>It takes Zuko much longer to blink the light from his eyes than it usually does, and he realizes why soon after. The village has been covered by a thick layer of fresh, bright snow. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s much bigger than the one time Zuko came, looking for Aang. There are more people, there are houses made of ice rather than tents made of pelts, and there\u2019s laughter all around him. </p>\n<p>Children are playing in the winter wonderland. Women are cooking delicious-looking spiced meat. Men are doing a variety of tasks: sharpening weapons, building houses, chatting. </p>\n<p>Sokka can\u2019t be older than seven, and even now, he\u2019s a strategist. He, Katara, and several other young children are having a snowball fight. It seems to be boys against girls. Sokka\u2019s built himself a crude fort for cover with a house at his back so no one can sneak up on him. </p>\n<p>He throws a ball at Katara, only about five years old and absolutely adorable. She shakes the snow from her face and glares at her brother, who\u2019s sticking his tongue out. </p>\n<p>Then she hold up her hands and pulls. </p>\n<p>The snow on top of the house Sokka is in front of falls on top of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHa!\u201d Katara shouts. </p>\n<p>Sokka pops his head out of the pile of snow. \u201cHow\u2019d you <em>do</em> that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d a woman asks, coming around the corner. Zuko sees the resemblance\u2014and the necklace she\u2019s wearing\u2014and realizes this is their mother. </p>\n<p>\u201cKatara moved the snow with her <em>mind</em>,\u201d Sokka complains, pulling himself out of the snow. \u201cThat is not fair!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looks at her daughter. \u201cKatara, can you do it again?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara looks uncertain now, especially now that all the other children at looking at her. But with her mother\u2019s gentle encouragement, she raises her hands again. This time, Sokka\u2019s entire fort gets knocked down. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he sulks. </p>\n<p>Their mother brightens. \u201cKatara, I think you\u2019re a waterbender!\u201d </p>\n<p>Of course, that catches the attention of the entire village, and soon, Sokka is forgotten. Zuko sees this, winces at the boy\u2019s dejected look, and moves to try to comfort him. </p>\n<p>Hakoda beats him to it. Which is good, because Zuko kind of sucks at the whole comforting thing. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, your mother was talking about wanting to cook tuna for dinner tonight,\u201d he says, steering Sokka away from the crowd flocking around his sister. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I go fishing?\u201d </p>\n<p>This immediately cheers him up. \u201cOkay!\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko tries very, very hard not to be jealous. He fails. </p>\n<p>Hakoda is just...such a good dad. He makes it very clear to Sokka that just because Katara is a bender, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to suddenly stop loving Sokka, and he does this with both words and actions. His wife Kya does the same, although it\u2019s pretty clear that, as much as Sokka loves his mother, he\u2019s definitely closer to his father. Even though Hakoda\u2019s the chief of the village and very busy making sure things run smoothly, he always sets aside time for his children.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get him wrong: Zuko is very happy for Sokka and Katara. He\u2019s <em>thrilled</em>. If anyone of their soul family is going to have the tormented childhood and abusive parents, Zuko wants it to be himself. He doesn\u2019t want anyone, never mind his soulmates, to have to go through what he did. And it kills him a little to know that, while he\u2019s watching these loving family moments, Sokka\u2019s stuck in his fucked-up past.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t help but wonder: if Ozai was a fraction of the father\u2014a fraction of the <em>man</em>\u2014that Hakoda is, both Zuko and the Fire Nation would have been much better off. </p>\n<p>Zuko watches Hakoda teach Sokka how to use a boomerang. \u201cThis is because it\u2019s my mark on Katara, right?\u201d Sokka asks, throwing it and waiting for the rebound.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the other people?\u201d Sokka asks, pulling up his sleeve so he can look at the marks on his arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cHead\u2019s up, Sokka.\u201d </p>\n<p>He looks up, and ducks just in time. The boomerang flies past his head and ends up in the snow. </p>\n<p>Hakoda chuckles, getting the boomerang and wiping off the snow. \u201cThose are your other soulmates. You\u2019ll meet them someday.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d be my other brothers and sisters,\u201d Sokka says. </p>\n<p>Hakoda chokes on a laugh, kneeling in front of his son. \u201cCould be, but probably not. Your mother and I are perfectly happy with two children.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut in a way, those marks <em>are</em> your siblings. They\u2019re going to be some of the most important people of your life: your best friends, maybe even a girlfriend.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka makes a face at the mention of a girlfriend. \u201cDo you have soulmates?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Hakoda unbuttons his jacket, then pulls down his shirt collar enough to reveal two marks, one on either side of the hollow of his throat. \u201cThe spear is Bato. The feather is your mother.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you and Uncle Bato raised like brothers, even though you aren\u2019t brothers?\u201d Sokka asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cBato\u2019s parents died when he was little. Because he\u2019s mine and Kya\u2019s soulmate, it fell to one of our parents to take care of him. My parents took him in because they had more room. Like I said, your soulmates are sort of like your siblings. In that sense, I would be like their father, too. It\u2019d be my responsibility to look after them.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka looks at his own marks again. His thumb brushes against the golden flame. Zuko\u2019s mark. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not Water Tribe? What if...what if they\u2019re Fire Nation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hakoda taps his chin. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been a long time since anyone in our tribe has had soulmates from anywhere else. But it has happened before. They\u2019d just become honorary tribe members, and they\u2019d still have to put up with me. Firebender or not.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Dread pools in Zuko\u2019s stomach when, as Katara and Sokka play one day, the snow turns black. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find Mom.\u201d Katara runs off toward their house.</p>\n<p>The Fire Nation ships land. Zuko recognizes the Southern Raider flags and tucks that information away for later. </p>\n<p>This fight goes much differently than when Zuko attacked the village. Even though the Water Tribe warriors are badly outnumbered, they manage to repel the bulk of the force. Sokka throws a snowball at one and, even at eight years old, he runs out to help. </p>\n<p>All the soldiers retreat. </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s shoulders sag in relief. The warriors around him, those old enough to know better, are still tense and confused. </p>\n<p>Then Bato takes Sokka by the shoulder, grief in his eyes. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>The man leads Sokka to his house, not Hakoda\u2019s. The chief and Katara are already there. Katara is a mess, and as soon as she sees Sokka, she launches herself at him, sobbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened? Are you hurt?\u201d Sokka asks, holding his sister. He looks to Hakoda, who has tears in his eyes and is staring at the ground. His knuckles are pressed against where Kya\u2019s mark is on his chest. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d </p>\n<p>Neither of the men move, or speak. They\u2019re in shock, Zuko realizes. The pain of losing a soulmate is too much. </p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s the one who blubbers it out, explains that a Fire Nation soldier got into their house, that she saw him interrogate their mother before Kya sent her away, and by the time Katara came back with Hakoda...</p>\n<p>They stay in that house for a long time.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>For about a week, the village is in shock. Life goes on as usual, but it\u2019s subdued. They hold a funeral for Kya, burying her in a circle of stones. Hakoda doesn\u2019t speak. Sokka and Katara don\u2019t say much of anything, either. Their grandmother can\u2019t even get out of bed, she\u2019s so depressed by the death of her daughter. </p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t know how he can help. If he even should help. It was his people who took Sokka\u2019s mother away. And even if it wasn\u2019t, Zuko\u2019s not really the comforting type. The best he can do is keep someone warm when they\u2019re cold, but so far the thick Water Tribe clothing has been doing that for him. </p>\n<p>He stays away.</p>\n<p>After about a week, Katara pokes Sokka awake. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re going fishing.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka blinks. \u201cWha?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFishing. We\u2019re out of food. Dad won\u2019t go, and neither will Bato. So we\u2019ve gotta get it.\u201d She pokes him again. \u201cFishing. Now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka groans. But he gets up.</p>\n<p>They go fishing. At eight and six, they\u2019re not exactly experts, even though Hakoda\u2019s taught Sokka the basics. They plop a line in the water, sit in the snow, and wait. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo...how are you?\u201d Sokka asks. </p>\n<p>Katara looks down. \u201cI miss her.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t want us to be like this, though.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka smiles, and nudges her shoulder. \u201cNo. But don\u2019t think you can be the boss of me.\u201d </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how it goes. Katara pulls the family together. It jolts Hakoda, Bato, and Kanna out of their grief enough that they start moving again. </p>\n<p>Zuko watches all of this without once letting Sokka know that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s pretty sure that destiny just wants him to observe, for now. </p>\n<p>That is, until twelve-year-old Sokka, out on a hunt with his father and a couple other adults, gets separated from them. </p>\n<p>And then a blizzard hits. </p>\n<p>The snow and wind are so thick that it\u2019s impossible to find adequate shelter. So Sokka makes it himself, by digging a little cave into a mound of snow. He crawls inside, shivering as the temperature gets lower and lower. He\u2019s protected from the wind and falling snow, but without a fire, he\u2019s still in danger of freezing to death.</p>\n<p>As soon as Sokka is settled, curling into a ball to conserve warmth, Zuko moves. He positions himself so that his fire-infused spirit is touching as much of Sokka as possible and holds him.</p>\n<p>Sokka jerks, startled a little. \u201cW-Wha...\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko uses his fingers to press the spot on Sokka\u2019s arm where his soulmark is. </p>\n<p>Sokka sucks in a breath. \u201cF-figures you\u2019d be a\u2014a friggin\u2019 fire bender.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko wishes they had to a way to tap out <em>sorry.</em></p>\n<p>The blizzard rages for several hours. Zuko keeps him warm the whole time, listening to him talk, watching him sharpen his boomerang, watching him sleep. He pokes him awake when the storm clears. The shelter is almost completely buried, the entrance Sokka carved out shrunken to a tiny hole. He digs himself out and brushes the snow from his clothes. He looks around. The tundra looks the same all around as far as Zuko\u2019s concerned, but Sokka manages to get his bearings and start walking. </p>\n<p>It takes him over an hour to get to the village. As soon as he\u2019s spotted, he\u2019s swarmed. </p>\n<p>\u201cSokka!\u201d Hakoda pushes his way through the crowd and all but crushes his son in a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re all right!\u201d </p>\n<p>The boy beams. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Katara is right behind their father. \u201cI knew you were okay! Your mark didn\u2019t fade at all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Hakoda demands, pulling back just enough so he can look him up and down for injuries or frostbite. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I made a shelter in one of the snow mounds,\u201d Sokka says. He scratches the back of his neck. \u201cAnd then...well, I\u2019m pretty sure our soulmate showed up.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara brightens. \u201cWhich one?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA new one. The fire guy.\u201d Sokka grows a little more nervous. \u201cHe...might be a firebender?\u201d </p>\n<p>The people still. The last fire raid is still fresh on everyone\u2019s mind. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Gran-Gran says after a pause. \u201cBenders\u2019 spirits have always been different. Waterbenders are cool, airbenders are flighty, earthbenders are tough and solid, and firebender spirits are warm.\u201d </p>\n<p>Even though he\u2019s invisible, Zuko feels extremely self-conscious as the tribe goes through several different emotions. They\u2019re obviously relieved Sokka\u2019s okay, but they do not like the prospect of not one, but two children of <em>their</em> tribe being bound to a firebender. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, he saved Sokka,\u201d Katara defends, looking up at all the adults around her as if daring them to defy her. \u201cSo he can\u2019t be a bad guy.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko wants to laugh. <em>Just wait until you meet me. You\u2019ll change your mind real quick.</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sokka and Katara decide to do their soulbond. Zuko wonders why he\u2019s supposed to watch until after it\u2019s done. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so now we need to set up codes,\u201d Sokka says. </p>\n<p>\u201cCodes?\u201d Katara repeats. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, a way to communicate! Since we can\u2019t talk to each other like that but can still touch.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko wants to smack himself. It\u2019s brilliant, and he feels like an idiot for not thinking of it himself. </p>\n<p>This communication is much more complex than the \u201cone for yes, two for no\u201d that Toph went by. Sokka and Katara manage to come up with codes for yes, no, danger, I\u2019m here, safe, and several others. </p>\n<p>And now Zuko\u2014and he imagines Aang, Toph, and Suki\u2014also know.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>While the South Pole is isolated from the rest of the world, this is not absolute. They do get the odd trader and messenger. One of them is from the Earth Kingdom. </p>\n<p>Sokka is thirteen, Katara eleven, when a messenger from the Earth King himself comes to the village. He has a private meeting with Hakoda, but it doesn\u2019t stay private for long. </p>\n<p>The war against the Fire Nation is going badly. The Earth Kingdom is on its last legs. Ba Sing Se, Omashu, and the North Pole are the only strongholds left. The Earth King needs soldiers. </p>\n<p>Hakoda does not give an order. He puts it to a vote. Leaves it to the men of the tribe to determine what\u2019s more important: staying home where it\u2019s safe, or going out into the world to try to make a difference. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of convincing. The warriors understand. The Fire Nation invaded their village just a few years ago. They invaded them again decades prior to eradicate their waterbenders. They\u2019re not going to stop until someone makes them stop. </p>\n<p>Sokka tries to go with them. Hakoda says no, and leaves him to defend the tribe. </p>\n<p>He hugs both his children good-bye, and tries to lighten the mood a little. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for anyone with your marks.\u201d </p>\n<p>As everyone watches the ships leave, Zuko taps on Sokka\u2019s shoulder the message for <em>I\u2019m here</em>. It\u2019s the best he can do.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko has to save Sokka from the cold again when the idiot falls through the ice a few months later while out fishing. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Sokka groans, struggling to get to his feet. </p>\n<p>Zuko stays. The blizzard was bad enough. Getting drenched in cold water here is deadly. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S your fault,\u201d Sokka slurs. \u201cStupid fire war.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko winces. He still stays with Sokka as the boy marches to the village, and collapses as soon as he\u2019s seen. Katara and the adults carry him inside, strip him down, and drop him in front of a fire. </p>\n<p>Katara takes over body heat, snuggling with her brother under a heavy fur blanket. As soon as he knows they\u2019ve got it, Zuko slips out. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They find Aang and go with him around the world. Zuko finds himself acting less as a heating pack and more as a danger-alert system. Often against himself. </p>\n<p>When they do make it to the North Pole, Zuko is completely unprepared to deal with Yue. Sokka had said his first girlfriend had turned into the moon, but \u201cgirlfriend\u201d means a lot of different things, and rarely means \u201cone of the greatest loves of my life.\u201d Especially the first girlfriend. </p>\n<p>Yue is very different. Sokka is head-over-heels in love, and while his efforts to distance himself from her are valiant when she\u2019s engaged to someone else, it\u2019s not enough. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s crushed when she dies and cries himself to sleep that night. Zuko does nothing. If he hadn\u2019t captured Aang, forcing the group to follow him, maybe Zhao wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill the moon spirit. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s well-hidden feelings of insecurity get worse when Katara masters her bending. He does a very good job of hiding it with arrogance, but Zuko can see it clear as day. Because he has felt the same thing with his own sister. </p>\n<p>Granted, Katara is a much, <em>much</em> better sister than Azula could ever be. Her bending is incredible, and she uses it a lot, but she never shows it off, and never uses it as a tool against Sokka. </p>\n<p>Aang is much the same, as is Toph when she joins. Three of the world\u2019s most amazing, powerful benders. And Sokka. </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t count you. Not being a bender and all.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI can still fight!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Three on three-plus-Sokka.\u201d </p>\n<p>It comes to a head when they\u2019re hiding out in the Fire Nation, waiting for the eclipse. The three benders effortlessly save a village from getting burned from the fire caused by a meteor, and Sokka can do absolutely nothing. </p>\n<p>The group tries to make him feel better. Zuko wants to help, but he can\u2019t. He\u2019s part of the problem. His very touch would remind Sokka of his bending. So he stays back. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s floored when Sokka ends up getting tutored by Piandao. </p>\n<p>And again when it turns out Piandao is a member of the Order of the White Lotus. </p>\n<p>Curious...</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cDude. Run,\u201d Zuko says. Not that Sokka can hear him. Even if he could, he\u2019d be ignored. <br>\u201cWhere. Is. Suki?\u201d Sokka snarls. Azula just smiles at him. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>At the Western Air Temple, Sokka goes out foraging by himself. </p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s not sure when this is. Probably after he\u2019s joined the group, but is it before they knew he was their sixth, or after? </p>\n<p>He notices the edge of the cliff being too unstable and quickly punches <em>danger</em> to Sokka. The boy jumps just as the cliff gives way, and scrambles onto safer ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sokka mutters. Zuko pats his shoulder and leaves. </p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he blurts. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d </p>\n<p>Frowning, Zuko taps <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo you know that our big plan is to defeat the Fire Lord and Fire Nation before they can win the war with the comet, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and that doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>Hm. How to tap that with the limited vocabulary he has. He settles on <em>danger</em>, slowly. </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s quiet for a long moment. Then he says, \u201cThanks for saving my life. Twice. At least. I don\u2019t think I ever said that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko blinks. He didn\u2019t know what to say or how to respond to that, so he just awkwardly pats Sokka on the back. </p>\n<p>The warrior snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re such an awkward turtleduck.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t know why he has to see any more of the Boiling Rock. He was already here!</p>\n<p>But no, destiny will have its way. He finds himself watching Sokka slip into Hakoda\u2019s cell, helmet on. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re okay!\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda is on his feet in a heartbeat, fists up. \u201cIf you take one step closer,\u201d he growls, \u201cyou\u2019ll see just how \u2018okay\u2019 I am.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sucks in a breath. <em>It\u2019s not Ozai. It\u2019s Hakoda. He\u2019ll never hurt Sokka. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s FINE. It\u2019s not Ozai. It\u2019s\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Sokka takes off his helmet. \u201cDad, it\u2019s me.\u201d </p>\n<p>The aggression immediately drops. Hakoda even tears up as they hug. Zuko sags with relief. </p>\n<p>They sit against the wall, and Sokka gives him a run-down of their situation. \u201cAnd you know Prince Zuko?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe son of the Fire Lord? I don\u2019t know him, but I know of him,\u201d Hakoda says, and Zuko cringes a little. He\u2019s not sure he wants to know what kind of stories Hakoda\u2019s heard. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s here, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a major problem.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cActually, he\u2019s on our side now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda makes a face, kind of similar to the ones Katara keeps throwing at him. Zuko can\u2019t help but feel insulted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I had the exact same reaction,\u201d Sokka admits. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done, it was hard to trust him. But he\u2019s really proven himself and I never would\u2019ve found you without his help.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda tips his head. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure...\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s also our sixth. The fire guy.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda blinks. \u201c<em>Really?</em> Wait, then why was he on your tail all this time?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cHis grandpa burned off his marks right after he was born.\u201d </p>\n<p>The next moment would be kind of funny in any other circumstances. Hakoda\u2019s face completely shuts down, like the words just don\u2019t make sense to him. It takes several heartbeats for it to register, and when it does, it\u2019s followed by anger and grief. \u201cShit.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cHe was pretty beat up when we tested it with him and Aang. I\u2019m pretty sure he thinks he still has to make it up or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hakoda\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t guilt him into helping you, did you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? <em>No!</em>\u201d Sokka looks horrified at the very idea of doing that. \u201cI actually planned on going on my own. He caught me sneaking out and insisted he come with. He wouldn\u2019t listen to me when I said that it was all my fault you were stuck here in the first place and that it was my responsibility to get you out.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda\u2019s face softens, and he puts an arm over his son\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSokka. Nobody blames you for the invasion failing. Even the best strategies sometimes don\u2019t go through. And while I cannot begin to tell you how glad I am to see you, it was never your responsibility to get me out. Me, Bato, the others, we would have all happily stayed in prison until the end of the war if it meant you and your soul family were safe and able to fight another day.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s lip trembles. Hakoda pulls him into a hug. Then everything turns white.</p>\n<p>--<br>--</p>\n<p>Sokka reels back from him and swears, pacing up and down the length of the room. Zuko winces a little. \u201cEr...sorry about that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sokka rounds on him, jabbing a finger in his direction. \u201cNu-uh. You do not get to apologize for any of that. You\u2019ve already apologized enough. Just...spirits, Zuko! Your dad is the literal incarnation of evil and if I ever get my hands on him Aang won\u2019t even have to fight him...\u201d </p>\n<p>He goes on like this for a while. Zuko presses his thumb against the cut on his palm, stemming the bleeding as his listens with half an ear. He\u2019s more bemused than anything else. </p>\n<p>Finally, Sokka calms down. They sit next to each other against the wall. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI was kind of a dick to you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs. \u201cYou had a pretty good reason.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. You saved my life, and I never thanked you for it until last week.\u201d </p>\n<p>He shrugs again. He notices Sokka\u2019s hand is still bleeding and bandages it. Sokka lets him work in silence before saying, \u201cSo, you couldn\u2019t hear it, but I was kind of squealing like a little girl when you finally told Ozai where to shove it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko bursts out laughing, almost falling over. He\u2019s not sure why he finds it so funny\u2014it\u2019s not\u2014but he does. </p>\n<p>When he recovers, he notices that Sokka looks rather pleased with himself. But then he sobers. \u201cSo, uh, you probably saw already. But you know how in the Water Tribe...\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat Chief Hakoda is basically planning on adopting all of us?\u201d Zuko asks. \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t get me wrong: he\u2019s a great dad. But I\u2019m just...not ready for that. At the very least, I need to find my uncle first.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka groans. \u201cThey\u2019re <em>both</em> gonna adopt us.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zuko says, trying not to think about his uncle. While he\u2019s positive Iroh will want nothing to do with <em>him</em>, he also knows that Iroh won\u2019t hesitate to open his heart and home to the rest of Team Avatar. He\u2019s already helped them several times. And they deserve him.</p>\n<p>Sokka flicks his ear. \u201cNone of that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNone of what?\u201d Zuko asks, cradling his ear. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your \u2018I am such a horrible human\u2019 look and I don\u2019t like it. So it\u2019s no longer allowed.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy, Sokka.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d He stands up, stretching. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to bed. Don\u2019t let us crash and die.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Zuko says, watching Sokka\u2014watching Brother\u2014leave.</p>\n<p>Zuko remembers that he hasn\u2019t slept in three days after they land at the Air Temple. </p>\n<p>Katara is thrilled to have her father back (even though she still doesn\u2019t give Zuko the time of day), and all of the team members are happy to have their final soulmate back, safe and sound. They get a fire started, heat up a stew, and Sokka fills everyone in.</p>\n<p>Zuko sits between Aang and Suki, listening to her, Sokka and Hakoda take turns telling the tale. When Suki learns that Hakoda ran into her fellow warriors at a previous prison, she demands to know what's become of them, and is obviously relieved and pleased to hear that they're alive and getting along with several other prisoners.\nThe storytelling is a Water Tribe tradition, as the father and son play off of each other beautifully, drawing out the tension and describing the fights and prison in dramatic detail. He remembers seeing similar scenes in cozy Water Tribe tents in the South Pole as Gran Gran, Bato, and several others entertained children and adults alike with tales of fantasy and whimsy. </p>\n<p>Zuko lets their voices wash over him. He wants to sleep\u2014needs to sleep\u2014but really, really doesn\u2019t want to leave to go to bed in his cold, dark room. He feels safer and more at home here than he ever has in his life, and that\u2019s including when he had his mother! </p>\n<p>Eventually the voices kind of blur and fade in the background as he nods off, still sitting up and hunched over his empty bowl. </p>\n<p>He rouses just a little when he feels the bowl being removed from his limp fingers, and feels a hand on his back. Normally, he would blast fireballs first, ask questions later. But he knows that hand, even if he\u2019s too tired to remember her actual name. </p>\n<p>Guard gently lowers him to the ground, and his head gets pillowed in a lap. This is much more comfortable than sitting hunched like a gargoyle. Calloused fingers scratch his scalp, and damn that feels good. He hums, and drifts off to sleep. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The next morning, he\u2019s a little concerned. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s been dog-piled. Toph is using his legs as a foot-stool, which is practically cuddling for her. Sokka is on Zuko\u2019s other side, snoring in his ear and sharing his pillow. </p>\n<p>Oh, and his pillow is Suki. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s asleep like everyone else. One arm is behind her head as a makeshift pillow. The other is in Zuko\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>...shouldn\u2019t she be doing this with Sokka? Or at least <em>not</em> Zuko?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a damn good thing he didn\u2019t get any nightmares last night. Any movement would have woken all three of them, any noise would have woken <em>everyone</em>.</p>\n<p>The sun is just starting to rise, which is when he usually wakes up, anyway. He carefully extracts himself from everyone, hoping the shadows hide his blush, and goes to relieve himself before waking up Aang for his lesson. He also changes out of his prison clothes into something a little more his speed, and feels guilty for it. Suki, Hakoda, and Chit Sang will be stuck in their rags if the group doesn\u2019t do something about it. He decides to see if they can go into a nearby village later. </p>\n<p>He pulls Aang out of bed, into their usual training courtyard, and they get to work. </p>\n<p>About an hour into their lesson, they start to draw a crowd. Sokka likes to watch most bending lessons. Earlier, Zuko assumed it was because he was bored and/or liked cracking jokes at their expense. Now, after the soulbond, he\u2019s positive it\u2019s that, <em>and</em> Sokka is analyzing their firebending technique, figuring out how he as a non-bender can defend against it. </p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not just Sokka. Suki and Hakoda show up, too. They spend half of the lesson watching, half of it talking amongst themselves. Zuko ignores them, focusing on correcting Aang\u2019s form. Aang does a few of the same mistakes Zuko did when he was first learning firebending. But rather than berate, smack, and/or burn him like what the sages did to Zuko, the prince nudges, critiques, and occasionally shouts if it\u2019s a particularly dangerous mistake. He tries to remember to praise him at least once every lesson, too. That doesn\u2019t come naturally to him, but Aang soaks it up like a sea sponge. </p>\n<p>The first lesson after their soulbond, Aang gave him the most formal bow he\u2019d ever seen and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a really great teacher, Zuko. Thank you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko blushed and just pushed him to the main courtyard for breakfast. Being called \u201cSifu Hotman\u201d after that was almost a relief. </p>\n<p>Now, they\u2019re wrapping up, Aang having finally gotten the hang of a particularly difficult firebending move, when Suki asks, \u201cHey, Zuko, can you do that again, from the other angle?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I want to see how I would defend against it,\u201d she says. Sokka and Hakoda, who had been talking to each other, now fall silent, watching with interest. </p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs, turns so she has the other angle, and repeats the move. When the flames fade away and he looks up, Suki has a calculating look on her face. \u201cOne more time.\u201d </p>\n<p>He obeys. Then she stands in front of him, getting in a stance. \u201cAnd again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, what?\u201d he asks, stepping back. \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in the very likely scenario that I <em>do</em>?\u201d he demands. He\u2019s put his soulmates through a lot of pain, but at least he\u2019s never actually burned them! </p>\n<p>\u201cWorst case scenario, Katara\u2019s right around the corner,\u201d Suki says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and she\u2019ll probably kill me,\u201d he mutters. </p>\n<p>Suki doesn\u2019t respond to that. She\u2019s just got this look of utter confidence. Zuko remembers how she fought her way through a dozen firebenders to get to the warden and sighs. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p>\n<p>He gets into the stance, fire curls at his fingertips, he moves his fist forward to punch\u2014</p>\n<p>Suki smacks his wrist aside, steps into his space and palm-strikes his chest, sending him crashing to the ground. </p>\n<p>For a second, everyone just stares. </p>\n<p>Suki smirks, getting back in a ready stance. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re quitting now, firebender.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aaand it\u2019s on. </p>\n<p>Sparring Suki\u2014yes, with firebending\u2014is kind of similar to sparring Ty Lee, in that Suki is constantly moving, diverting attacks rather than blocking, and going after his soft, squishy parts. She gets in a few good hits, and so does he (not burns, though; never burns). </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not entirely sure if this fight means anything. It could be Suki trying to get some sort of revenge, using the old sparring excuse to punch him a few times. It could also just be totally innocent I\u2019m-a-non-bender-and-need-to-know-how-to-defend-myself-in-case-Zuko\u2019s-crazy-sister-shows-up-again training session. Either way, he\u2019s really enjoying himself. And from the look on Suki\u2019s face, she is, too. They\u2019re at it for a while before a shrill whistle makes them pause. </p>\n<p>Hakoda lowers his fingers, <em>everyone</em> gathered around him. \u201cBreakfast is ready,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two call it a draw for now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suki and Zuko look at each other. He kind of wants to keep going, to be honest. </p>\n<p>But then someone\u2019s stomach growls. He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s him or her, but either way, he realizes that he is <em>starving</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d he says, dropping his arms. He bows to her. \u201cGood fight.\u201d </p>\n<p>She returns the bow, albeit in the Earth Kingdom style rather than Fire Nation. </p>\n<p>Sokka looks like he\u2019s fallen head-over-heels in love with her all over again, and immediately takes her arm to escort her to breakfast. Zuko can\u2019t really blame him. Oh, Suki is not his type by any means. And even if she was, he\u2019d never do that to Sokka. But it seems they do share a similar taste in powerful women, and if he had been watching Mai hold her own in a sparring match against someone like, say, Katara or Toph...</p>\n<p>Thinking about Mai again wipes the small smile from Zuko\u2019s face as he trails behind everyone to the food. He\u2019s not really paying attention to where he\u2019s going or who\u2019s around him. </p>\n<p>Which is how he\u2019s surprised when the person next to him clears his throat, and he realizes he\u2019s sitting next to Hakoda. </p>\n<p>Oops. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Hakoda asks with genuine concern in his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh. Yeah.\u201d Zuko turns to his food. Rice, with some veggies someone managed to forage. No one else is around him, everyone else clustered into little groups. He\u2019s effectively alone with the Water Tribe chief.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looked a little depressed earlier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko snorts. \u201cAsk anyone here. I\u2019m always either depressed or angry. Usually angry, if we\u2019re being honest.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, like most teenagers, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko is about to snap a reply when he sees Hakoda\u2019s slight smirk and realizes the man is telling a joke. He snorts in response and takes a bite. </p>\n<p>And then...he doesn\u2019t know why. Maybe the emotions are getting to be too much, or maybe because Hakoda reminds him of Iroh. Either way, he finds himself quietly saying, \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAbout?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMai.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe knife girl who helped us?\u201d Hakoda clarified. At Zuko\u2019s nod, all he says is, \u201cAh. She means a lot to you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend, I guess. Maybe?\u201d He scratches the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine so, for a guy in your position. Do you feel guilty about it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSort of?\u201d Zuko admits. \u201cLike, I know if we could have done something, we would\u2019ve. And I know that without her help, we\u2019d all have died a horrible, painful death. But at the same time, if I hadn\u2019t been there in the first place, or if I\u2019d just been <em>better</em>, then she wouldn\u2019t be sitting in a prison cell. Or worse.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cZuko, if you\u2019re going to blame anyone, it should be me and Chit Sang,\u201d Hakoda says. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who were supposed to be watching the warden.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blaming you, chief,\u201d Zuko says honestly. Maybe he blames Chit Sang a little, but Hakoda? Can you really fault the guy for being more concerned with the safety of his son than the security of a jerk? </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd no one\u2019s blaming you, either,\u201d Hakoda replies. \u201cLeast of all Mai. I won\u2019t pretend that I know her, or even you, to be honest. But she seems like an intelligent young woman?\u201d </p>\n<p>Since it\u2019s phrased as a question, Zuko nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen she knew what she was doing,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I imagine if your positions had been reversed, you\u2019d have done the same thing.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko nods again. He can\u2019t say he feels much better about Mai\u2019s predicament, but it is nice to know that someone else, at least, understands. Actually, out of all of them, Hakoda probably understands best. The prison uniform is low enough that everyone can see his soulmarks. The spear for Bato is vibrant and colorful, but the feather next to it is a faded gray. Dead. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re silent as they continue to eat. Katara starts taking dishes to wash them, Aang and Toph leave for their lesson, all the others clear out to explore the temple. Zuko and Hakoda are still eating, but as their bowls empty, Zuko sighs. \u201cSo...you know I\u2019m their soulmate.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hakoda says, in a very neutral tone. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I know about the Water Tribe\u2019s views on soulmates.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko groans. \u201cI\u2019m not good with...dads. Or parental figures of any type. So I\u2019m probably going to be avoiding you? No offense?\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda gives an understanding smile. \u201cAll things considered, I can\u2019t imagine you have a good relationship with your father, or a good view of anyone even remotely like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>nothing</em> like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Hakoda starts counting off his fingers. \u201cFather of two, father of at least one extraordinary bender, leader of a nation, trained in warfare, leading war efforts...that\u2019s similar enough for a lot of people.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you burned your son\u2019s face for speaking out of turn?\u201d Zuko asks. </p>\n<p>Again, Hakoda has that look on his face, like someone is speaking a foreign language. His eyes dart to Zuko\u2019s scar before focusing more fully on his eyes. \u201cNo...\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not similar. Trust me. Sokka and I did the soulbond on our way back, and if I\u2019d seen you treat my soulmates half as badly as Ozai treated me, I\u2019d have dropped you from the airship, no questions asked.\u201d </p>\n<p>A handful of dishes drop into water behind them, and Zuko realizes that, yup, that was within Katara\u2019s hearing. Before he has time to backpedal or run, Hakoda chuckles. \u201cGood. Kya did the same thing with Bato\u2019s mother.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko tips his head. \u201cHuh?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBato\u2019s father died when he was very young. Hunting accident. He and Bato\u2019s mother were soulmates. Pairs, not a trio like me or a sextet like you. She didn\u2019t take his death well at all, and turned to drinking. And when she was drinking, she got mean. Started taking it out on Bato, since he\u2019d been there, blamed the death on him. Never mind that he was six.\u201d </p>\n<p>Something dark twists Hakoda\u2019s expression for a moment before it smoothes out. \u201cThis was happening under everyone\u2019s noses. We knew she had a drinking problem, but didn\u2019t know about the abuse. At the same time, Kya and I knew that Bato was our soulmate and spent a lot of time together. He took advantage of that, tried to stay out of his home as much as possible. </p>\n<p>\u201cOne day, we had to be around eight or nine, Kya and I saw the bruises on Bato. He tried to play it off, but eventually we got him to tell us. Now, at the time, my father was the chief. I wanted to tell him right away, to have him settle this. Kya had the same idea, but went about it very differently. She went straight to Bato\u2019s mother, who was drunk at the time, which is good because it meant she was uncoordinated. Kya then took her by the ear, twisted it, and <em>dragged</em> her all the way to my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko cringes a little just thinking about that. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we convinced Bato to tell the chief the truth. He didn\u2019t want his mother to get in trouble, but the fact of the matter is, she was hurting him. Had even managed to convince him that his father\u2019s death was his fault, which took years to undo,\u201d Hakoda says. \u201cHe stayed with me and my family while his mother was ordered to stay away from him and get sober.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a while. She tried to see him once, while drunk, while my father was out on a hunt. Kya snuck Bato away while I distracted her,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did get sober eventually, and she and Bato managed to salvage something of a relationship. But before it could go anywhere she got a tumor, and...\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko grimaces. \u201cTough break.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Can\u2019t say I was particularly sad to see her go, but yeah.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda startles him by putting a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAnyway, what I\u2019m trying to say is, to a certain extent, I get it. Bato was terrified of any and all mother-figures in his life until he was an adult. And he, Kya, and I were a little over-protective of each other after that, too. I don\u2019t expect you to start any kind of relationship with me just because my tribe pays special attention to some magic marks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zuko squeaks. </p>\n<p>Hakoda gives him a final pat before getting up and leaving. He passes his bowl to Katara before exiting the room. </p>\n<p>Leaving Zuko alone with the waterbender. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s resumed washing the dishes. He brings her his bowl and asks, \u201cDo you want any\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, glaring at him. \u201cAnd I know I didn\u2019t hear you threatening my dad.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just stating a fact. And since he\u2019s <em>not</em> an abusive jerk, I\u2019ll be leaving him alone.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, because you care so much about your soulmates,\u201d she sneers. </p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>do</em>!\u201d Zuko exclaims. \u201cLook, Katara, I am sorry for everything I did to you guys. You have to know that if I had known you were my soulmates I wouldn\u2019t have done any of it!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have <em>needed</em> to know! Not knowing that we\u2019re soulmates doesn\u2019t give you an excuse. You still tried to capture Aang, the world\u2019s final hope for peace, and did spirits know what in doing so,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>He closes his eyes, because that just hit the nail right on the head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Now get out of my face so I can get these done.\u201d </p>\n<p>He leaves her alone.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Later that day, Zuko, Haru, and Aang go foraging for edibles in the surrounding forest. When they come back, they hear retching sounds in one of the hallways. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s sick?\u201d Aang asks as they round the corner. </p>\n<p>They find Suki and Sokka. Sokka\u2019s the one throwing up. Suki is patting his back with a tight, sympathetic smile on her face. \u201cI warned you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he agrees miserably. \u201cMan, trying to kiss you as a guard was not smart.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it was not.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sees their bleeding palms, puts two and two together, and steers Aang and Haru out of the hallway. \u201cNot for us, guys.\u201d </p>\n<p>Before they\u2019re completely out of earshot, Zuko hears Sokka ask quietly, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d But he doesn\u2019t hear Suki\u2019s response. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Later on his stumbles upon Suki and Aang doing a soulbond. There\u2019s a flash of light coming from the palms, and the next instant, Aang is hugging her. And crying. </p>\n<p>Zuko walks out of the room before they see him. He thinks he hears Aang mumbling \u201cThank you\u201d over and over again. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The next morning goes quite similar to the first: Zuko and Aang do their lesson (though Zuko enlists Chit Sang\u2019s help so they can do a two-on-one scenario), then Zuko and Suki spar, then they have breakfast. </p>\n<p>Only, after breakfast, Suki follows him out of the main room. \u201cHey,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so this might be an awkward question, seeing as we don\u2019t really know each all that well, but I was wondering if you\u2019re down for a soulbond,\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>Zuko blinks in surprise. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d have to wait a while before Suki would want that with him. Maybe not as long as Katara\u2014he\u2019s not expecting her to turn around anytime this century\u2014but certainly more than a few days. </p>\n<p>At his hesitation, she steps back. \u201cIt\u2019s no rush. I was just wondering.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s pretty sure that was a flicker of hurt he saw across her face. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014and I\u2019ve said this before\u2014my past is really messed up. There are a lot of things in there that you\u2019re going to see that I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHow bad are we talking about?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it made Aang cry. And Sokka swear.\u201d </p>\n<p>She nods. Then she says, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \u201cWhen I was imprisoned, one of the guards attacked me. He didn\u2019t get far, but if I hadn\u2019t been able to fight back, it would\u2019ve been rape.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko blinks. \u201c...shit. No wonder Sokka threw up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. So, if you want to wait on it, that\u2019s fine. But you should know that you\u2019re not the only one with a painful history.\u201d </p>\n<p>It occurs to Zuko that...he really knows absolutely nothing about Suki. Even less than he did about the rest of the group when he first joined them. He knows that she\u2019s from an island of women warriors, got inspired by the team to help in the war effort, and somewhere in all that managed to get captured by Azula. </p>\n<p>But who are her parents? Why did she become a warrior if she never planned on leaving the island before meeting Sokka? How did she become the leader of the Kyoshi warriors in the first place? </p>\n<p>Zuko suddenly wants to know. So he takes out the knife Iroh gave him. \u201cWell, no time like the present. If I throw up, I\u2019ll try to aim away from your shoes.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki laughs. </p>\n<p>--<br>\n--</p>\n<p>Suki does not have a father. </p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s odd, at first. Her mother Pan is all she needs. Pan teaches her how to fight, how to fish, how to sew her clothes. Soothes her scraped knees and scolds her for neglecting any chores. The usual. It\u2019s kind of extraordinary, actually, because she\u2019s really young. She was probably still a teenager when Suki was born.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no father. No man running the house while the woman hunts and defends the border. And eventually, Suki asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d </p>\n<p>Pan is washing the dishes and stops. After a minute, she resumes, more slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably on a boat somewhere.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCan I meet him?\u201d Suki asks hopefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p>\n<p>She pouts. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a horrible human being, and if he ever comes anywhere near you it\u2019d only be to hurt you. Do you understand?\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki nods, wide-eyed. </p>\n<p>Zuko wonders. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like Sokka with the South Pole: Zuko really only shows up to keep Suki warm. </p>\n<p>She always smiles when he does, and calls him Blanket. He tries not to grumble about it.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Not all of Kyoshi\u2019s girls are turned into warriors. They\u2019re all taught basic self-defense, but the majority of them choose other careers: fisherwoman, shopkeeper, farmer.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s never a question for Suki. She\u2019s always known she wanted to be a warrior. </p>\n<p>At one point, she and the other girls are taking a break from training. Pan is their teacher, though she often switches with another warrior. Zuko notices that there are a lot of older women\u2014anywhere from age fifteen to fifty\u2014on this island who were not here when he attacked. It gives him a bad feeling. </p>\n<p>Suki sits with one of the older girls and notices a fresh scar on her arm. Right under a soulmark. Suki winces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Jiang.\u201d </p>\n<p>The girl gives a watery sigh. \u201cYeah.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko later learns that Jiang was the girl\u2019s other soulmate. A fisherman who was lost at sea. The mark turned gray about a week before this exchange. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a Kyoshi tradition to remove gray soulmarks. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to keep looking forward,\u201d Pan explains to Suki when asked. \u201cThe past will only wear you down. Learn what lessons you must from it, and then move on. This is one of the greatest lessons of Kyoshi.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki is eleven when she asks Pan, \u201cWho is my father?\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a thunderstorm. Everyone is staying inside. It\u2019s only the two of them, and they\u2019ve just finished dinner. They\u2019re drinking tea now. </p>\n<p>Pan stares at the tea in her cup. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty story, Suki.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki takes her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p>\n<p>Pan sighs. \u201cMy father\u2014your grandfather\u2014was a merchant. I would go with him to the mainland, about a three day journey, to help him sell his wares. As I grew older and became better trained, I acted as a sort of bodyguard. Thought I was pretty hot stuff.\u201d </p>\n<p>She snorts, taking a sip of tea. \u201cOne day, when I was sixteen, our boat got intercepted. Pirates. I tried to fight them off, but there were too many.\u201d She takes a shaky breath. \u201cThey killed my father. Slit his throat and tossed him overboard. But as for me...well, they thought I was too pretty for that and had something else in mind. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who your father is. There were six of them. When they were done using me, they robbed the boat of any and all remaining coin and goods, and then left. Nine months later, you were born.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki is pasty white when her mother is done. Pan sips her tea like nothing ever happened. Zuko feels sick to his stomach, and has no idea what to do. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d Suki whispers. </p>\n<p>Pan almost chokes. She sets her teacup down and pulls Suki closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she says fiercely. \u201cI regret the circumstances of your birth, and if I ever see those bastards again I will castrate them and feed them to the unagi. But I will never regret having you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko breathes a sigh of relief as the two hug. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki is twelve when she loses her mother. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a fight that does it. Not the Fire Nation, not pirates, not the unagi. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a plague. It wipes out half the island. </p>\n<p>At the first signs, the strongest villagers make a temporary village on the other side of the island and send the weakest there: the children, nursing mothers, and the elderly. They\u2019re given strict orders not to come back until a messenger arrives declaring the village safe. Pan asks Suki to look after the other children before leaving.</p>\n<p>It works. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, by the time the plague passes, almost all of the strongest villagers are gone. The Kyoshi Warriors are practically annihilated. Including Pan. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki is a wreck. Zuko feels his other soulmates there when he tries to comfort her, but there\u2019s nothing they can do. The village struggles to rebuild. Suki and several other orphans sleep in the main house while everyone else works to ready for winter. </p>\n<p>And then one day, a few months later, Suki just...snaps out of it. </p>\n<p>It happens when she has to go through Pan\u2019s things, figure out what to keep, what to scrap, what to give away. She finds her mother\u2019s weapons. </p>\n<p>She examines a bladed fan for a long moment. Then she gets a brush and some ink. When she pulls up her pants leg, Zuko can see her line of soulmarks.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the marks, Suki writes her mother\u2019s name in beautiful, elegant script. She watches the ink dry. Then she scrapes off the ink with the fan, taking a bit of skin with it. </p>\n<p>After a quick bandage, Suki gathers up her mother\u2019s weapons and uniform, and throws away everything else. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki returns to training with a vengeance. Two adult warriors survive long enough to impart their skills to her before also passing away, one to drowning and another to old age. </p>\n<p>Suki is elected commander. She trains other girls, amassing a total force of nine warriors. </p>\n<p>Her closest friends are Lin, a sharp-sighted girl with inky hair who acts as second-in-command; Sen, who\u2019s best at first aid; and Lu Men, who spent a lot of time before the plague in the village jail for stealing and pick-pocketing. It seemed the plague triggered a change of heart in her.</p>\n<p>Their first real test comes a year after the plague. Pirates. Apparently they heard about the island\u2019s weakened state and decided it was ripe for plundering. </p>\n<p>Lin spots them coming, and Suki gets everyone ready. The warriors go into the woods, climbing high into the trees directly above the path the pirates have to take to get to the village. </p>\n<p>The men are laughing, weapons casually slung over their shoulders. \u201cI hope they have pigs. I haven\u2019t had good pork in ages.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll get enough silver to finally get a new sail?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping for some pretty girls to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Suki gives the signal. </p>\n<p>The Kyoshi Warriors descend on the pirates like avenging spirits. The first few seconds are complete chaos as the pirates stumble into the ambush. Zuko watches Suki carefully as she disarms and knocks unconscious her first victim. </p>\n<p>Then the pirates start fighting back. Their numbers are slightly less than the warriors at this point, so it\u2019s an even fight. Zuko warns Suki of incoming danger as someone behind her swings a sword at her back. She blocks with a fan and hits back. It's sloppy, but effective. </p>\n<p>After only a minute of fighting, the pirates decide it\u2019s not worth it. They came here for easy prey, not a fight. They quickly retreat. </p>\n<p>Suki watches them leave with narrowed eyes, then returns to her people. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When Aang, Katara, and Sokka show up, Suki doesn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n<p>The warriors give her odd looks. A village this small, everyone knows everyone\u2019s soulmarks, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that the three newcomers are Suki\u2019s. The trio also latch onto the fans and are not-so-subtly asking around. But she doesn\u2019t tell them, and everyone follows her lead. </p>\n<p>Suki and the warriors are putting on their makeup and outfits in the guard house when Lu Men casually asks, \u201cSo, are you not saying anything because the boomerang guy is a raging sexist, or is it something else?\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki glares at her. Lu Men meets it with a raised eyebrow. Everyone else does a horrible job of pretending not to eavesdrop. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe Avatar and his friends are going to the North Pole to learn waterbending,\u201d Suki says at length. \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll do if I reveal myself to them?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lin gets it first. \u201cThey\u2019d ask you to come with. And you think you should stay here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThis island is my home. You are my people,\u201d Suki says, snapping her makeup kit closed. \u201cSoulmates or not, my primary responsibility will always be the safety and protection of this island.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yes. The fact that that idiot is a raging sexist makes my decision a lot easier.\u201d </p>\n<p>The girls giggle and leave it alone. Except Lin, who whispers, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell them eventually.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki nods. \u201cAfter the war.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sokka throws Suki in for a loop by humbling himself, asking her to teach him. Suki hesitates. Zuko nudges her forward. </p>\n<p>She makes an annoyed face, but she does it.</p>\n<p>And yes, Zuko will cherish the image of Sokka in a dress for the rest of his life. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>After Aang leaves and the village starts repairing the damage from Zuko\u2019s fire, Suki is deep in thought. There were no deaths (for which Zuko is greatly relieved) and only minor injuries. Suki sprained her wrist, though, and Sen is the one who tends to it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, boss?\u201d Sen asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomething stupid.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki looks out the window, toward the ocean. \u201cKyoshi has stayed out of the war for a hundred years. And I\u2019m starting to think that that was a really selfish decision.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sen pauses in wrapping Suki\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou think we should join the fight.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should do <em>something</em>. Aang is <em>twelve</em>, and he\u2019s risking his life to end the war.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Avatar. It\u2019s his job.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying because someone has power, they\u2019re responsible for the betterment of others?\u201d Suki asks. </p>\n<p>Sen thinks about it, then nods. \u201cBasically, yeah. If you can help someone, you should.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what does that say about us? We\u2019ve had the ability to help for a hundred years. And we\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d </p>\n<p>The medic thinks again. \u201cI think that either choice is correct. Kyoshi is not the way it used to be. Maybe a few years ago, when we had more warriors, it\u2019d be a simpler answer. Right now, though, staying put to protect what we have is a good choice. The nine of us are the only thing protecting our people.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki hums, still looking at the sea. </p>\n<p>Sen finishes wrapping Suki\u2019s wrist. \u201cHaving said that, if the Fire Nation ever decided to turn their eyes this way, nine girls won\u2019t make a lick of difference. Going out into the world to do some good is also a good choice.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki tears her eyes away from the window to stare at Sen. </p>\n<p>The medic is smiling at her. \u201cYou do what you think is best, boss. The rest of us, we trust you. We\u2019ll follow you to the end.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki\u2019s decision to leave is met with hesitation, then widespread support. All the other Kyoshi Warriors volunteer to go with her. They take a boat and head for the Earth Kingdom mainland. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what exactly is the plan?\u201d Lin asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cMake our way to Ba Sing Se,\u201d Suki says. \u201cThat\u2019s where most of the fighting is happening, and where we\u2019ll be most needed. We\u2019ll offer our services to the Earth King.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lin nods. \u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll tell Lu Men to keep her hands off of anything shiny.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t make it to the Earth King. A few weeks into the trip, they find a bunch of firebenders burning a village to the ground. Several of the firebenders go after the helpless villagers trying to escape. </p>\n<p>Suki and the others attack. It\u2019s a vicious fight that lasts well over an hour, the smoke and fire getting in everyone\u2019s way. But eventually, the firebenders flee. </p>\n<p>The villagers had gone to a nearby lake, away from the fire. Suki and the others are covered head to foot in soot, and several of them are sporting burns and injuries. Sen has her hands full. </p>\n<p>Suki talks to the village leader. They decide to go to Ba Sing Se. The Kyoshi warriors agree to act as escort in a heartbeat. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>They get to Full Moon Bay relatively easily. Some of the warriors are teaching the younger villagers\u2014especially the girls\u2014the basics of fighting. A cranky old woman demands passports and tickets. Suki explains the situation, and they manage to get said passports and tickets for the villagers. The old woman then enlists the warriors as her personal guards. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had half a dozen Fire Nation scouts try to sniff the place out in the last month,\u201d she snarls, flicking away some paperwork. \u201cWhat few guards I have here are barely worth their weight in platypus bear dung. You want to do your part? Help me keep this place safe and civil.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki takes her proposition to the others, and after a bit of debate, they agree to stay. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Suki?\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki stretches her arms over her head. It\u2019s been a long day at work. \u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lin points to a group of kids at the head of the line. </p>\n<p>Suki blinks. Then grins. \u201cCover my shift, would you?\u201d And she goes to greet her soulmates. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Serpent\u2019s Pass?\u201d she almost shrieks. \u201cFor real?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lin, who reported the rumor mill, nods. \u201cApparently the madam won\u2019t let them give away their tickets, and the sweet idyllic family cannot fend for themselves. So obviously, the Avatar\u2019s escorting them.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki sighs, rubbing her eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Suki, I know it\u2019s none of our business. But they are your soulmates. And they\u2019re about to do something stupidly dangerous. They need you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> need me,\u201d Suki counters. </p>\n<p>Lin smiles. \u201cWe can handle ourselves for a few days. Go to your soulmates, Suki. If they have any sense, they\u2019ll understand where you\u2019re coming from and won\u2019t push you to do anything you don\u2019t want to.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki looks at the cave of refugees and her warriors. Then she rushes to get ready. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sokka acts stupidly over protective, and it\u2019s clearly getting on Suki\u2019s nerves. It\u2019s getting on Zuko\u2019s nerves, too. </p>\n<p>But then Sokka asks, \u201cSo, uh, Suki. Me and the others were talking, and, uh, you know, we kind of have this soulmark that looks a bit like a fan...\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki huffs. \u201cYup. That\u2019s me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara freezes, forcing Toph to bump into her. \u201cWhat?!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Sokka wails. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you have your destiny, and I have mine,\u201d Suki says. \u201cYou guys have to save the world. I had to make sure my village was safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>Toph smirks. \u201cAnd yet, here you are.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki blushes, and resumes walking. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>When they finally do get through, and the baby is safely delivered, the soulmates gather \u2018round. Suki and Sokka have already had their moment, and Zuko gags at the lovey-dovey expressions the two keep sharing. </p>\n<p>That is, until Suki says, \u201cI\u2019m heading back. You guys stay safe, okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>The others hesitate. Toph\u2019s the one who asks, \u201cNo soulbond?\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki shakes her head. \u201cNot yet. Which means you all have to stay alive and in one piece until we meet again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara pulls her into a hug. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of you, Suki. I know you feel torn up about it, but people like you are the reason we keep fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suki smiles and hugs back. When they pull apart, there\u2019s some discreet tear-wiping. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for our sixth,\u201d Suki promises over her shoulder. \u201cSay hi to Appa for me!\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Despite all odds, Suki gets back to the bay in one piece, though not without narrowly avoiding another attack by the sea monster. </p>\n<p>The other warriors have decided they\u2019ve had enough of their crabby boss and agree to move on. Their work as guards has earned them all a bit of a paycheck, and they pool their money to spend it on weapon upgrades: shields and swords. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cNo...it couldn\u2019t be.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s jaw drops as Suki follows the trail of bison fur through the forest, up a steep hill, to...</p>\n<p>\u201cAppa?\u201d she gasps. \u201cOh, no!\u201d </p>\n<p>Watching the exchange, Zuko feels sick. He\u2019s not particularly close to Appa, certainly not as close as the others are, but he cares about the bison. Seeing him now, wounded, dirty, <em>chained</em>, makes him want to rage and scream and set something on fire.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing Suki isn\u2019t him. That reaction would not go over well.</p>\n<p>She collects her warriors, and they coax Appa out of the cave. Lu Men picks the locks. Sen carefully plucks out the quills. Lin scouts out and finds a pond for them to give him a bath. </p>\n<p>After a few hours, Appa is clean, de-chained, and happy. Even Zuko is smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Lin asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow we get him back to Aang,\u201d Suki says, running a hand through Appa\u2019s fur. \u201cThey\u2019re on their way to Ba Sing Se, so that\u2019s where we need to go.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sen puts hand hands on her hips, studying the bison with a critical eye. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all going to fit without a saddle.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t. But I can do it myself,\u201d Suki says. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him back to town, first, give him a proper meal and find some rope for the reins. Then tomorrow morning I\u2019ll ride him to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Appa stiffens. All the warriors hear it, and immediately pull out fans and shields. </p>\n<p>Azula, Mai and Ty Lee burst out of the trees. \u201cMy, my, you\u2019re easy to find...\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>As good as they are, the Kyoshi Warriors cannot defeat the trio on their own. With Appa\u2019s help...well, it\u2019s possible. Maybe. A fraction of a chance. </p>\n<p>Zuko might have rolled with those odds, but Suki does not. And when she realizes Appa is afraid of fire, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to pick up the burning branch. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to find Aang!\u201d she orders. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay!\u201d </p>\n<p>Appa hesitates, his sense of loyalty clashing with his fear of fire. The fear wins, and Suki smiles as he flies off. </p>\n<p>Zuko smacks her arm to warn her of Azula\u2019s approach. She raises her shield just in time to catch a fire blast, and pulls out another fan. </p>\n<p>By now, almost all of her warriors are down, chi blocked by Ty Lee or pinned down by Mai. Lin is the only one still standing, blocking knives with her shield and fending off Ty Lee with her sword. Suki takes on Azula. </p>\n<p>And almost\u2014<em>almost</em>\u2014wins. </p>\n<p>She manages to slam her shield into Azula\u2019s side, knocking the girl off-balance, and then presses her advantage. Her bladed fan is aimed right at the princess\u2019s face, and Azula barely ducks out of the way. </p>\n<p>A thin line of blood appears on her cheek. Azula\u2019s eyes burn with fury, and Suki smirks. </p>\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s not Azula who takes Suki down. It\u2019s Ty Lee. Mai finally manages to pin Lin, and when she does, Ty Lee flips over to Suki. Too fast for the warrior to block, Ty Lee jabs her in her chi points, and the warrior drops. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Azula only asks them one questions: \u201cWhere is the Avatar?\u201d </p>\n<p>The chi blocking hasn\u2019t worn off yet. Even so, Suki manages to look confident and imposing when she answers, \u201cThe safest place in the world.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mai sighs. Azula\u2019s eyes narrow in frustration. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The girls are all taken to a nearby Fire Nation prison. Their vibrant green uniforms are removed, replaced with bland prison clothing. </p>\n<p>Suki scans the line of guards and mass of prisoners. \u201cKeep your eyes open, ladies. See if you can sniff out any weak points.\u201d</p>\n<p>They do. But before they can report back to Suki, one of the guards tell her, \u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable. You\u2019re being transferred tomorrow.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suki demands. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the leader. Princess Azula specifically asked that you be taken to the Boiling Rock.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the others hear this, Lu Men\u2019s face blanches. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that. It\u2019s the highest security prison in the Fire Nation.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki sighs. \u201cGuess I better consider that a compliment. How are we on a prison break?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe might have an opening during the eclipse,\u201d Sen says. \u201cBut this place is locked down tight. They\u2019re not taking any chances.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre any of you getting transferred?\u201d </p>\n<p>They shake their heads. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Lin, you\u2019re in charge. The rest of you, you stay together. Look after the other prisoners here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lin scoffs. \u201cMost of them are Fire Nation!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAvatar Aang is trying to end this war,\u201d Suki says. \u201cThe whole point of us fighting with him is to bring balance to the world. We can\u2019t do that if we keep treating everyone with Fire Nation blood as the villain. We have to show them what it means to act with honor and integrity. Understand?\u201d </p>\n<p>They nod. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The day of the transfer, Suki is chained at the wrists and ankles, and walks with her head held high into the bowels of a ship that takes her to the Boiling Rock. </p>\n<p>During the transfer, she\u2019s patted down for weapons. The guard doing it, a beefy man named Lei, spends way too long checking her chest and butt area. Suki narrows her eyes, but says nothing. </p>\n<p>They take her to a tiny cell with barely any light. She\u2019s unchained, and locked inside. Zuko sits beside her and immediately leans against her side so she knows he\u2019s there. Her breathing is shaky. \u201cStupid circus freak.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Lei, the guard who was feeling her up earlier, suddenly visits out of the blue. Suki sits up in her cot. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>The guard closes and locks the door behind him. \u201cI wish the Earth Kingdom had more female soldiers. It gets gross doing this with guys.\u201d He grins. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, sweetie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, shit. This is what Suki was talking about. </p>\n<p>She understands the same time Zuko does, and stands up. \u201cGet out. Now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOr what?\u201d He holds out his hand, and a little fire appears in his palm. \u201cYou try to resist, and I burn your pretty face. You bite anything, and I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t eat for a week. You scream, and I kill you. Do you understand your situation?\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki\u2019s face is perfectly blank. The only thing giving away her fear is the slight tremble of her hands.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s jaw drops when she shrugs, turns her back, and takes off her shirt.</p>\n<p>The guard smiles, putting out the flame, and puts his hands on her. He leaves wet kisses on her neck, rubs himself on her ass, and fondles her breasts. Suki rolls her eyes, but doesn\u2019t move or resist. </p>\n<p>Until he reaches for her pants. </p>\n<p>The warrior moves lightning-quick. She slams her heel on his foot, then kicks his knee so hard it pops in the opposite direction. At the same time she takes his hand and spins around, wrenching his arm. They go to the floor, and she lands on his back, pinning him down.</p>\n<p>His screaming draws the attention of the other guards, and three of them pile into the room. They pull Suki off of him and push her against the wall. The captain of the guard, a woman, is furious. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShe attacked me!\u201d the guard whimpers. </p>\n<p>The captain looks at Suki, who is still topless, and raises an eyebrow. \u201cReally. And what were you doing in her cell in the first place?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI was\u2026doing an inspection.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cInspections aren\u2019t scheduled until tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lei gulps.</p>\n<p>The captain orders him removed to the infirmary, and tells the others to let Suki put her shirt back on. The captain stands in front of her. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d she asks, surprisingly gentle.</p>\n<p>Suki blinks. \u201cUh. No. No, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I apologize for my man\u2019s behavior. At the very least, he will be fired. And I\u2019m assigning only guards that I explicitly trust to handle you for the rest of the journey.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sags in relief. Suki gives a slight bow. \u201cThank you, captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The situation may have been handled with grace, but it still messes Suki up. She wakes up with nightmares and doesn\u2019t let any man touch her if she can help it. The captain assists where she can\u2014the vast majority of the guards assigned to Suki are women\u2014but there\u2019s only so much she can do. </p>\n<p>Zuko hesitates to help\u2014he\u2019s a guy, after all, and he\u2019s not sure if that\u2019ll make the situation better or worse\u2014but decides to act after Suki wakes from another nightmare, heaving with breath. He taps <em>I\u2019m here</em> on her arm, even though she hasn\u2019t had a chance to learn that from Sokka yet.</p>\n<p>She wraps her arms around her knees. \u201cCan I get a hug, you guys?\u201d </p>\n<p>He's quick to obey. With him on the left and Sokka on the right, they lull her back to sleep.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Suki turns the Boiling Rock into her own personal training ground. She leaves the guards alone, but picks a fight with almost every other prisoner. </p>\n<p>Especially the non-benders. Especially the fast ones. Who move like Ty Lee. </p>\n<p>Even though she\u2019s not a firebender, she ends up in the cooler a lot for her trouble. Zuko keeps her warm. She smiles. \"Thanks, Blanket.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an unassuming day at the Boiling Rock, when Suki suddenly gasps. Her hand goes straight to her soulmarks. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s in the yard, in public. Everyone around her gives her strange looks. Despite the fact that time outdoors is a precious commodity, she tries to run back to her cell. The guards won\u2019t let her; they use this time for cell inspections. </p>\n<p>So she punches one of them in the face. </p>\n<p>They throw her in the cooler. </p>\n<p>Zuko is confused by all of this behavior, until she\u2019s finally left alone and she rolls up her pants to reveal her soulmarks. </p>\n<p>Aang\u2019s is flickering, turning from blue to gray and back to blue. </p>\n<p><em>Ba Sing Se</em>, Zuko realizes, a sick feeling in his gut. </p>\n<p>Suki makes a wounded sound. \u201cCome on, Aang. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sits in that cooler for what feels like hours, shivering. Zuko does what he can to keep her warm, but he\u2019s pretty sure his presence doesn\u2019t even filter. Her eyes never leave the mark. Her shoulders do not lose their rigidness until the arrow returns to vibrant blue, and stays that way. </p>\n<p>She drops her head between her knees with a sigh. \u201cWhen I see you again, Aang, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for word to reach the Boiling Rock that the Avatar is dead. </p>\n<p>Suki keeps to herself. Zuko has no idea what she\u2019s thinking, but he knows she\u2019s contemplating something serious. Whatever it is, she makes up her mind when she hears that Azula will be returning to the capital. </p>\n<p>Despite the Boiling Rock\u2019s security measures, Suki still manages to get her hands on a little hand-made knife. She takes it back to her cell and rolls up her pants. All of her marks are vibrant and colorful. </p>\n<p>She cuts off Aang\u2019s. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s still reeling from shock. He\u2019s gone his whole life without his marks, would have cheerfully killed to have them back ages ago, and here Suki went and <em>deliberately</em> removed one? </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get it. Until Azula visits.</p>\n<p>Prison is very routine, so when the door opens unannounced, both Suki and Zuko tense. </p>\n<p>Azula enters, and the door closes behind her. </p>\n<p>Suki stays lying on her mattress and looks at the ceiling. </p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to bow?\u201d Azula asks. \u201cI just conquered your kingdom. That makes me your princess.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki does the smart thing, and does not engage. </p>\n<p>Azula prowls closer. \u201cI also killed your precious Avatar.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki\u2019s eyebrow twitches. It\u2019s her only response. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only one Azula needs. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to avenge him? He <em>was</em> your soulmate, after all.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know me better than that,\u201d Suki says. \u201cIf I try to kill you now, I\u2019ll not only fail, but I\u2019ll be executed tomorrow. Better to wait until I\u2019m out of here and I can sneak into your bedroom to slit your throat.\u201d </p>\n<p>She says it so coldly and matter-of-fact that Zuko believes her. He kind of wishes she wouldn\u2019t\u2014Azula is his sister after all, and assassination in any form tends to be frowned upon\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t blame her for trying. </p>\n<p>Azula seems more amused than anything else. \u201cLet me see your marks.\u201d </p>\n<p><em>Oh,</em> Zuko realizes. <em>Okay, then. Way to think ahead, Suki.</em></p>\n<p>Suki slowly smirks, her eyes finally meeting Azula\u2019s. \u201cI thought you said you killed him. Are you doubting your own abilities?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSince the Water Tribe peasant took his body, my father will want proof. A gray mark is better than nothing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYour own father wouldn\u2019t believe your word?\u201d Suki asks innocently. </p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s jaw clenches, just a little. \u201cYour marks. Unless you want me to burn the clothes off of you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTempting. That would be pretty sexy, but unfortunately my type is more sarcastic and blue-eyed.\u201d Still, Suki pulls up her pants sleeve to reveal her marks. </p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou cut it off. Hiding something?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Kyoshi tradition,\u201d Suki says, straightening out her clothes. \u201cWhen a soulmate dies, you remove their marks from your body.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHmph. And I thought <em>I</em> was considered heartless.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cKyoshi believed that strength lies in looking forward, not back,\u201d Suki says. \u201cAnd sometimes, putting the past behind you is painful. Aang is dead. He\u2019s not coming back. </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly...that\u2019s not entirely true. He\u2019s the Avatar. He\u2019ll show up again in the Water Tribe, won\u2019t he? And you\u2019ll have to go through the trouble of finding him and tracking him down. Without a comet deadline, he\u2019ll have all the time in the world to master the elements.\u201d Suki looks Azula up and down. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t kill you. I think the next Avatar would like that pleasure for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI killed this one,\u201d Azula says. \u201cWho\u2019s the say I can\u2019t kill another?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou killed a twelve-year-old child,\u201d Suki snaps. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a fourteen-year-old teenager. Imagine what I\u2019ll be in my prime, when the Avatar comes again.\u201d Azula knocks twice on the door, signaling to be let out. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, Suki. I\u2019d love to hear about your other soulmates.\u201d </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Azula does come back. Once every few days, she and Suki have a verbal sparring match. It\u2019s hard to tell if the princess is trying to get more information out of Suki, or if she\u2019s just trying to break her spirit. Probably both. </p>\n<p>Sometimes, Suki checks out, spending the time meditating. She gets very good at schooling her expressions so no emotions pass her face. Other times, she replies to Azula\u2019s barbed wired words with some of her own. </p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you got attacked by one of the guards en route. Maybe I\u2019ll have him transferred here. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to say hello.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki doesn\u2019t respond to that one. She hides her trembling fingers behind her head as she looks at the ceiling, meditating while Azula talks. </p>\n<p>Azula threatens her village, asking, \u201cWhere was it you said you were from? Kyoshi Island? I think I\u2019ll visit one of these days. I\u2019m sure whatever buildings you have can be greatly improved with a bit of heat.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWatch out for the unagi,\u201d Suki responds. \u201cPart of the reason we stayed out of the war for so long is because it keeps attacking your ships. All the spicy food you eat must make you especially tasty.\u201d </p>\n<p>Another time Azula says, \u201cI wonder how well your precious Sokka\u2019s doing. Probably starving in a ditch somewhere. Won\u2019t be long before that little boomerang on your leg turns gray.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when it does, do me a favor and get me a knife, would you?\u201d Suki responds. \u201cI\u2019ll carve out that flesh and even send it to you, wrapped in a bow. You can give it to your father, and maybe he\u2019ll pat you on the head like the little bitch you are.\u201d </p>\n<p>She gets slapped for that one. Her response is a smile.</p>\n<p>Zuko is amazed. He grew up with Azula, with her taunts and cruel words. The best he could ever hope for was a tie when they argued. Most of the time, she left him feeling stupid and hurt. </p>\n<p>But for Suki, the worst she\u2019ll get is a little frustrated and a lot exhausted. Sometimes, Azula will be the one to leave in a huff, only to come back a few days later. </p>\n<p>It takes Zuko a while to get it: Azula needs this. Suki is the closest she\u2019s come to an intellectual equal in...ever. Mai and Ty Lee are her friends, to a certain extent, but they\u2019re too afraid of her to defy her. Suki is constantly challenging her, and Azula needs that. </p>\n<p>The whole thing leaves him in awe of Suki and with nothing but pity for Azula. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Azula only ever gets truly violent once, and it\u2019s during her last visit to Suki. Two days before the invasion. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour boyfriend is leading an attack on the capital soon,\u201d she says off-handedly. \u201cI was thinking of stringing you up over the gates by a rope around your neck, let him watch you strangle to death. Or maybe dress you in Fire Nation armor and put you on the front lines.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to put me in Fire Nation colors.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Why not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d look better than you. And then I would escape, and even if the invasion plan fails, you\u2019d have to explain to daddy dearest why you <em>failed</em> to keep me in line.\u201d </p>\n<p>She emphasizes that word, fail, and Zuko knows she\u2019s figured Azula out. That in all the time Azula has been prodding at her, trying to learn what makes her tick, Suki has been doing the exact same thing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI fail?\u201d Azula says carefully. \u201cI never do that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou failed to kill Aang.\u201d </p>\n<p>Azula raises her eyebrows. \u201cSo you admit it, then. The Avatar\u2019s alive.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re both smarter than that,\u201d Suki says. She swings her legs around the bed so she\u2019s facing Azula head-on. \u201cWhy else would you come here that day? If you had truly believed that you\u2019d killed him, there would be no need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so glib with giving that kind of information to the enemy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t do anything with it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Azula chuckles. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d have to admit to failure. That you weren\u2019t good enough to kill the Avatar.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI told everyone my brother killed the Avatar,\u201d Azula says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould they believe you, though?\u201d Suki asks. \u201cRegardless of who claims to kill him, you\u2019ve said that he\u2019s dead. You were there. You did everything in your power to confirm it. Despite your best efforts, he survived, enough to gather an <em>invasion</em> on the homeland. How\u2019s your father going to react to your carelessness?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe invasion plan is doomed. We\u2019ve been preparing for months.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut will it be enough? Do you truly, one hundred percent believe that your father can defeat the Avatar during an <em>eclipse</em>? You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been preparing. And even if the invasion fails, Aang would probably slip through your fingers again. And then what? You explain to your father why you failed\u2014again\u2014to capture a twelve-year-old child. You\u2019d be just as pathetic as your brother\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula grabs Suki by the collar of her shirt and slams her against the wall. \u201cI am <em>nothing like him</em>!\u201d she snaps. \u201cI am better than him in <em>every way</em>!\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki raises an eyebrow. \u201cCareful, Azula. You\u2019re acting very unlike a princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula steams. Suki\u2019s face is neutral. Zuko holds his breath. </p>\n<p>Azula leans in closer. \u201cWhen this is over, I\u2019m going to gather the heads of all of your soulmates and use them to decorate your cell.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki smirks. \u201cI\u2019ll enjoy watching you try.\u201d</p>\n<p>--<br>\n--</p>\n<p>Zuko blinks, and he\u2019s back in the present. </p>\n<p>At first, they\u2019re not entirely sure what to do with each other. Suki huffs and says, \u201cI should\u2019ve killed that bitch.\u201d </p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one to lose a fight to Azula. But you <em>are</em> the only one I know who\u2019s made her bleed.\u201d </p>\n<p>She preens. \u201cWanna spar?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLove to.\u201d</p>\n<p>The day after Suki and Zuko\u2019s soulbond, Azula shows up. </p>\n<p>Because of course she does.</p>\n<p>\u201cFather and I are going to have so much fun with your soulmates, Zuzu,\u201d she taunts as they battle on the airship.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me, first,\u201d he says, and throws another fireball.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>They set up camp, and Sokka toasts Zuko, and Zuko\u2026he finally feels like maybe, he can truly be a part of this group. That he has friends. A family. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m touched,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Katara says, and storms off. It\u2019s like a bucket of cold water. Because he <em>doesn\u2019t</em> deserve this. Any of it.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI was the first to trust you!\u201d Katara shouts. \u201cRemember? Back in Ba Sing Se. And you turned around and betrayed us!\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko groans. \u201cWhat can I do to make it up to you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. Maybe you can recapture Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King! Or, I know, you can bring my mother back.\u201d </p>\n<p>As she moves past him, Zuko grabs her arm. She tears herself free. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t bring your mother back,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know who killed her. And I\u2019m going to help you find them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The rest of the group have some concerns. </p>\n<p>And honestly, Zuko doesn\u2019t get it. The whole pacifism thing. The whole not-wanting-revenge thing. If it were his mother, if it had turned out that she was murdered, not a force in this world or the spirit world could stop him from avenging her.</p>\n<p>Also, Katara is really fucking scary, and angry, and maybe this will help redirect that anger to anyone other than Zuko. </p>\n<p>And even if it doesn\u2019t, she needs the closure. </p>\n<p>They convince Aang to let them take Appa, agree to meet up at Ember Island, and go. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>So. Bloodbending. That\u2019s a thing. </p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko decides not to ask and just reminds himself not to pick another fight with Katara. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Katara doesn\u2019t kill the man who killed her mother, and Zuko isn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019s always been a better person than him, better than anyone else he knows. Hurting other people for her own personal pleasure just isn\u2019t in her nature. She needs a better reason, like self-defense.</p>\n<p>Still, he hopes that the confrontation was helpful in some way. </p>\n<p>He flies them to Ember Island and lets her go off alone. He tells Aang what happened, and the kid sags a little in relief. </p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s just hoping that she\u2019ll stop conflating him with that monster of an ex-captain, and he can work with the rest of the group without worrying about getting dunked in the ocean. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t expect Katara to smile and him and say, \u201cBut I can start to forgive you.\u201d Never mind <em>hug</em> him. </p>\n<p>Luckily, Zuko\u2019s gotten pretty good at hugs, so he returns it. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Being back at Ember Island is\u2026unpleasant. Memories echo in every hall, and even though most of them are pleasant enough they weigh on him. </p>\n<p>The nightmares are horrible. </p>\n<p>The good news is they\u2019re all sleeping in separate rooms now, even if Suki and Sokka usually end up in the same one by morning. </p>\n<p>The bad news is Zuko forgot that the walls are a bit thin. Or maybe he\u2019s just loud. Probably both. </p>\n<p>Either way, when he wakes up with a scream, the rest of the team are there in a heartbeat, looking for a threat. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sokka asks, sword out. \u201cAre you hurt? Zuko?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he pants, embarrassed and terrified. The nightmare had been one of the worst: Aang getting his face burned the exact same way Zuko had, only Ozai doesn\u2019t stop at the skin. He keeps going until the boy\u2019s whole head is nothing but a charred skull. </p>\n<p>He looks at Aang, confirming that he\u2019s unhurt, and sags. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for waking you. Go back to bed.\u201d </p>\n<p>The others look at each other. Sokka sheaths his sword, and they file out. </p>\n<p>Katara stays. </p>\n<p>She sits on the edge of his bed. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d he admits, wiping the sweat from his face. Glancing out the window, it looks like dawn is still a few hours away. He probably only got about three hours of sleep. And no way is he going back to bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a usual thing?\u201d she asks, her voice thick with concern that reminds him a little of Ursa. \u201cIs it why you always slept apart in the temple?\u201d </p>\n<p>Dammit. She\u2019s too smart. Why can\u2019t she go back to hating him? At least then he didn\u2019t have to talk about this.</p>\n<p>She puts a hand on his shoulder. \u201cZuko, we all get nightmares. Aang dreams about the Air Nomads, Sokka dreams about Yue, Suki dreams about her attack, I dream about Mom, and Toph\u2026okay, Toph doesn\u2019t get nightmares. But the rest of us have been there. And we want to help you. It doesn\u2019t look like leaving you alone to deal with it by yourself has been particularly helpful.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, are you telling me that I can make all bad dreams disappear with the power of friendship?\u201d he sneers. \u201cOr maybe you can use your magic healing water to make it all better?\u201d </p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t take the bait, staying perfectly calm and serious as she says, \u201cI can try.\u201d She bends some water out of her bag. </p>\n<p>Normally, Zuko would snap and fight, insisting that he doesn\u2019t need this. But he\u2019s tired. So fucking tired. And the habit of having Snowflake care for him is settled deep in his bones, so he grumbles but is otherwise completely compliant as she puts her hands and water on his head. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026nice. Soothing. He\u2019s not sure how she\u2019s doing it, but the bending seeps into his mind, rocking him exactly the way his mother used to when he was kid and was having trouble sleeping and\u2026</p>\n<p>He takes Katara\u2019s wrist and pushes her away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get another nightmare,\u201d he admits. <em>We never should\u2019ve come here.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, we\u2019re going to share a bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? Families do it in the Water Tribe all the time.\u201d </p>\n<p>He squirms. Katara\u2019s a gorgeous girl, even if she isn\u2019t his type. Co-ed sleeping is not a norm in the Fire Nation, not unless some other activity was going on\u2026</p>\n<p>Wait. Did she just call him family?</p>\n<p>She gives him a flat look. \u201cZuko. You need to sleep. If it looks like you\u2019re having a nightmare, I\u2019ll wake you up.\u201d </p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cOkay. I trust you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>He does have another nightmare that night. It\u2019s the one where Iroh\u2019s yelling at him, blaming him for everything as the world burns down around them. But just as it\u2019s getting particularly bad, a blue haze falls around them. Cool water washes the nightmare away, and he\u2019s instead on a winter beach.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t remember much of that dream other than snippets of turtle-seals and the sense of peace. When he wakes up at dawn, he finds Katara asleep next to him, snoring softly into a pillow. He slips out of bed, tucks the covers up to her chin, and leaves. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The next night, Aang and Toph declare that sleeping in separate rooms is boring. They move all the furniture in the living room, set up a bunch of blankets and pillows on the floor, and declare it the new communal sleeping space. Katara\u2019s all in. So are Sokka and Suki, with minimal complaints from the former. It\u2019s closer to the food, anyway.</p>\n<p>After a bit of hesitation, Zuko joins them. He doesn\u2019t remember, but he learns later that, when he started twitching from a nightmare, Aang curled up on his back and tapped <em>safe</em> on his arm over and over again. It worked. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Zuko?\u201d </p>\n<p>He grunts, drinking water after an intense lesson with Aang. The kid\u2019s getting good, and it fills Zuko with equal parts pride and dread. The comet is days away. </p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s standing in front of him in the courtyard. Everyone else went inside to eat breakfast, and Zuko has half a mind to join them. </p>\n<p>Until he notices a familiar knife in Katara\u2019s hands. </p>\n<p>She smiles. \u201cMight as well make it official. If you\u2019re comfortable doing it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sets the water canteen down. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, Katara.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d </p>\n<p>He could say no. He could ask to wait, and she\u2019d honor that without question. </p>\n<p>He takes the knife. </p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>Zuko opens his eyes to the day of Kya\u2019s death. </p>\n<p>Great start. </p>\n<p>\u201cMom!\u201d Katara bursts into the tent to come face-to-face with Yon Rha. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo find your father, sweetie. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d Kya gives her a brave smile. With a pang, Zuko thinks she and Ursa would have gotten along famously. </p>\n<p>Katara runs out of the tent and gets Hakoda. \u201cDad! There\u2019s a man in our house, and he won\u2019t leave!\u201d </p>\n<p>Hakoda flips a man over his shoulder, and then goes still. His hand goes to his collarbone, where his soulmarks are, and he sprints to the tent, Katara on his heels. </p>\n<p>Zuko tries to stop Katara. No kid needs to see what\u2019s in there. But she runs right through him and into the tent. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Just like in Sokka\u2019s vision, the family is plunged into grief and darkness. Zuko hesitates to intervene. The last thing Katara needs right now is a firebender.</p>\n<p>She pulls the family together, gets them to function again. Until the war tears them apart. Hakoda and the men leave. </p>\n<p>Katara puts on a brave face, for her family and tribe. She dries the younger children\u2019s tears, takes care of Sokka during his hunting mishaps, and does chores with Gran-Gran. And then one day, she leaves to get some firewood. </p>\n<p>As soon as she\u2019s out of sight of everyone else, the mask shatters. She sits on the snow and cries. </p>\n<p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Zuko mutters. Katara\u2019s always, always been the comforter for everyone else. She comforted him when he was growing up. The least he can do is try to make that up to her. </p>\n<p>He sits next to her and hugs her. </p>\n<p>She wipes her face. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Totally fine.\u201d </p>\n<p>He taps, <em>no</em>.</p>\n<p>She sniffs, and lets him hug her. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Aang comes, and is taken away by past-Zuko. Katara watches the water with a determination that Zuko\u2019s grown very familiar with. \u201cWe have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our lives, now it\u2019s our turn to save him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko agrees, nudging her forward.</p>\n<p>Sokka speaks up: \u201cKatara, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you realize he\u2019s on our side? I know you don\u2019t like him, but we have to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara!\u201d </p>\n<p>She turns. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gonna talk all day, or are you coming with me?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Zuko stays with Katara throughout the journey, again, mostly as an alert system. But also, weirdly, as a comforter. An encourager. He pushes her forward when the earthbenders feel no hope in the Fire Nation prison at sea. Stays with her when Sokka and Aang disappear into the spirit world. Hugs her when Aang accidentally burns her hands. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s always quiet, and it\u2019s always private. She puts on a brave face for the others, is the glue that keeps them together and, in many ways, a mother who keeps them safe. But even the strongest people break from time to time. Zuko does his best to pick up the pieces. </p>\n<p>He also completely understands why Katara has been so livid with him. If he\u2019d found out one of the dearest people he relies on was the same stupid asshole who chased them around the world, he\u2019d be pissed off, too.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>When they finally reach the North Pole, Katara runs into a small problem. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your friend was a girl,\u201d Pakku says, disdain dripping from his voice. Zuko almost\u2014almost\u2014wishes the Fire Nation invasion of the North Pole had been successful, because <em>that</em>? That\u2019s the exact kind of bullshit Sozin wanted to get rid of. </p>\n<p>Sneaking lessons from Aang is probably a better solution. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you <em>doing</em>?\u201d Zuko wails as Katara\u2014untrained, idealistic, vulnerable Katara\u2014challenges a fucking bending master to a duel. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to win,\u201d Sokka warns as she marches out of the palace. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! Someone has to teach that old man a lesson!\u201d </p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine,</em> Zuko thinks, somewhat hysterically as Pakku comes out of the building, ignoring Katara. The few times the group has mentioned Pakku, it\u2019s always been positive and respectful. So obviously he doesn\u2019t hurt her today. Certainly not in the way Ozai hurt Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back to the healing hut where you belong,\u201d Pakku says, without even looking at her.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s blood boils. So does Katara\u2019s, and she uses the water whip on him.</p>\n<p>He sucks in a breath as Pakku retaliates, and the fight is on. Katara does very well, certainly better than Zuko did when he was her age. </p>\n<p>Pakku brings a wave of ice spears down on her, and Zuko wants to throttle him. Katara is, thankfully, unhurt, and the whole thing turns out to be a good thing because Pakku recognizes the necklace and realizes his patriarchal ways chased away his soulmate who\u2019s Gran-Gran and blah blah blah\u2026</p>\n<p>If Zuko ever sees him in real life they\u2019re going to have words. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The next time jump is substantial. They\u2019re on a Fire Nation ship, and it takes Zuko a minute to process what\u2019s going on. As soon as he does, he cringes. </p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s sitting next to a bed. Aang\u2019s bed. He\u2019s unconscious and wrapped in bandages. She\u2019s still wearing the dress that got ripped, singed, and dirtied up in the catacombs, so it\u2019s probably only been a day or two since the fall of Ba Sing Se.</p>\n<p>Zuko sits next to her. He hears her stomach growl, but she doesn\u2019t move, just continues to watch Aang with a distant look on her face. </p>\n<p>He taps onto her skin <em>food</em>, something Sokka made up but nobody has ever actually used. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>He taps more forcefully <em>food</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave him,\u201d she snaps. </p>\n<p>He wishes there was an easy way to tap out <em>You need to take care of yourself, too, you idiot</em>. Instead he just taps <em>safe</em>, followed again by <em>food</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up! Your princess is the one who did this to him!\u201d </p>\n<p><em>Yes,</em> he agrees, then taps <em>food.</em></p>\n<p>The door opens before she can respond, and Sokka comes in. \u201cHey. How is he?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe should wake up in a few days,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Then you have time to eat something.\u201d </p>\n<p>She glares at him. \u201cNot you, too\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cKatara, come on,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re no good to anyone if you starve yourself to death.\u201d </p>\n<p>She looks back at Aang. \u201cI can\u2019t leave him. What if something happens? If I messed up the healing, or the spirit water wasn\u2019t enough, or he wakes up early, or\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him,\u201d Sokka says. </p>\n<p>She blinks. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo eat something,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd get cleaned up, and maybe take a nap while you\u2019re at it. But eating is mandatory.\u201d </p>\n<p>She sighs, but gets up and hugs him. \u201cThanks, Sokka.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Meeting Hamma is terrifying. </p>\n<p>Not because of the bloodbending thing, though that is disturbing on its own. It unnerves Zuko because of how similar she is to Katara. How, under the right circumstances, Katara <em>could</em> potentially become a twisted abomination of everything that makes her good. She could become like Azula. </p>\n<p>Katara realizes it, too, and breaks down crying as the villagers lead Hamma away in chains. Zuko is there with Sokka, Aang, and Toph. He thinks about how many other girls have lost their parents to this war, how many other people\u2019s souls have rotted away in prisons, how many other otherwise good people have become twisted by hatred. Even if he doesn\u2019t make it out of this war alive\u2014and let\u2019s be honest, he probably won\u2019t; too many people want him dead, and of everyone on Team Avatar, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s least deserving of a happy ending\u2014he has to guarantee that his friends, his soul family, do. They can set the world on the right track. They can get a happy ending and give the world a shot at one, too. </p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>He should probably say something reassuring, or touching, or anything other than what he actually says:</p>\n<p>\u201cYou idiot! You went up against a <em>waterbending master</em> before you were even trained?!\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara blinks, then scowls. \u201cOh, that\u2019s rich coming from you, Mr. Let\u2019s-Fight-Every-Firebending-Master-I-Disagree-With.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko sputters. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the smart one! Doing things like thinking things through and considering consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the consequences of me <em>not</em> standing up to Pakku would have been worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could have killed you!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your dad could have killed you!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> the hotheaded idiot who doesn\u2019t think things through and jumps over rivers of boiling water! <em>You\u2019re</em> the smart heroic one who actually keeps us together!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGuys, guys,\u201d Sokka says, coming outside. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>both</em> idiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Sokka!\u201d they both snap. </p>\n<p>He shrugs and leaves. \u201cWhatever.\u201d </p>\n<p>The interruption has cooled Zuko down a bit. He runs a hand over his face. </p>\n<p>Katara huffs and pulls him into a hug. \u201cOverprotective dork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSnowflake,\u201d he retorts. </p>\n<p>She chuckles, squeezing him tighter. \u201cWhen this is over, we\u2019ll find your mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows, closing his eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That.</p>\n<p>Fucking. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Hurts.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko clutches his chest, whimpering as stray electricity dances around him. </p>\n<p>He hears Katara scream his name and Azula\u2019s insane laugh. </p>\n<p>Shit. Katara's fighting Azula now. Alone.</p>\n<p><em>Get up,</em> he orders himself. Get up, get up, get up!</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Toph would never admit it, but growing up, Zuko\u2014Sunshine\u2014was probably her favorite soulmate.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that there was anything <em>wrong</em> with the others. Just\u2026well, Katara had always taken care of her, and while she was very different from her parents, Toph sometimes had a hard time separating them in her mind. But it was still great to have an invisible ice pack for her cuts and bruises. Suki was usually there to warn her of danger, whenever a fight was about to go too far. Sokka helped her cheat on her tests, which was always fun. And Aang was always down to play with her, something she desperately needed as a child.</p>\n<p>But Sunshine? He <em>challenged</em> her.</p>\n<p>He helped her bend better, pushed her farther, and always urged her to get back on her feet. That was probably his biggest lesson: always get back up. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times you fall down or what situation you\u2019re in, you get back up. </p>\n<p>No one else did that for her. When she got knocked down, she was coddled by everyone but Sunshine, because he knew she could do better. </p>\n<p>So she gets back on her feet, even as the airship crumbles beneath her. She keeps bringing down more airships even as she and Sokka get separated from Suki. She keeps going, until she can\u2019t keep going any more.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Zuko can\u2019t get up. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not even a matter of pain. He can breathe through pain, he\u2019s been doing it all his life. Honestly, compared to getting his face burned, this isn\u2019t too bad. </p>\n<p>The problem is he can\u2019t <em>breathe</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>You overprotective, stupid, selfless, son of a\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s inner monologue cuts off as she dodges another streak of lightning. Unlike Zuko, she can\u2019t redirect any of it. A single hit, and she\u2019s dead. And then nobody will be there to heal him. Assuming he\u2019s still alive. </p>\n<p><em>Of course he\u2019s still alive,</em> she scolds herself. To think of anything else was ludicrous. Zuko never gives up, even in the face of impossible, insurmountable odds. They could ask him to fetch a pearl from the coldest depths of the ocean and he\u2019d find a way to deliver. </p>\n<p>She ducks behind a pillar, in a palace she knows as well as her own village. Zuko is lying in the middle of the courtyard, not moving.</p>\n<p>This is all her fault. If she hadn\u2019t moved, hadn\u2019t caught Azula\u2019s eye, Zuko would have won that fight himself. But she let her fear get the best of her. She\u2019d seen too much of what Azula had done, all of her horrible victories, and hadn\u2019t trusted Zuko to handle himself. </p>\n<p>Now he\u2019s dying. </p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Katara runs.</p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is respectful to bow to your elders,\u201d Pakku says in the rubble of Ba Sing Se\u2019s wall. He opens his arms. \u201cBut how about a hug, for your new grandfather?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Katara yells, hugging him as Sokka squeals behind her. While she\u2019s surrounded by her soul family (most of them, anyway; Aang\u2019s still missing), getting another traditional family member is like striking gold. </p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!\u201d Sokka cheers, also hugging him. Katara gives them a little space as Sokka tries to come up with more ridiculous nicknames for the already long-suffering Pakku, and sees Zuko open his mouth. </p>\n<p>She turns on him and scolds, \u201cBe nice.\u201d </p>\n<p>He holds up his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but you were going to.\u201d She softens. \u201cPlease, Zuko? He\u2019d never hurt me or Sokka.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face twists a little, but he stays quiet, at least until Pakku pries himself away from Sokka long enough to ask, \u201cAnd who are these three?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOur other soulmates!\u201d Sokka cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s Toph, my girlfriend Suki\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this is the extremely overprotective Zuko,\u201d Katara finishes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>extremely</em> overprotective,\u201d he defends. </p>\n<p>They all make noises against that, but it\u2019s all in good fun, and Katara can tell through the eyeroll he gives that he knows it. They\u2019re all a little overprotective of each other, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>Aang almost kills Ozai. </p>\n<p>Not Avatar Aang. <em>Aang</em> Aang. </p>\n<p>Not because of the loss of the Air Nomads. That had been Sozin, and it would be unfair to hold his grandson accountable for his actions. </p>\n<p>Not because of the loss of Katara and Sokka\u2019s mother. That had been Ozai\u2019s father, Azulon. </p>\n<p>Not even necessarily because Ozai wanted to destroy the world. </p>\n<p>But because of Zuko. Every bit of suffering he\u2019s been through could be laid squarely at this man\u2019s feet. </p>\n<p>Aang wouldn\u2019t even have to kill Ozai to get even. Just burning half of his face would likely be enough. </p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The Air Nomads raised him better than that. Gyatso raised him better than that. Spirits, even <em>Zuko</em> raised him better than that. Using the fire of his spirit to help others, to keep them warm on chilly nights and snowy days, rather than burning them. </p>\n<p>Aang had done his best to return the favor. Once he\u2019d realized what kind of environment Zuko had come from, he tried to show him that there was some good in the world. Even when his mother left, even when he was banished, there was still some kernel of happiness to be found. Some bit of beauty to appreciate.</p>\n<p>The same is true of people. No matter how evil they are, the sheer fact that they\u2019re human deserves to be respected and honored. If he killed Ozai, he\u2019d never be able to look Zuko in the eye.</p>\n<p>So he pulls himself out of the Avatar State and finds another way to end it. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s going to die.</p>\n<p>It would have been bad enough if the lightning had only burned his heart, but oh no. He\u2019s not that lucky. It also got his lungs. Breathing is like fanning a fire in his chest. Every second is agony. </p>\n<p>He realizes that he hasn\u2019t felt his soulmates since bonding with them. Nobody realized it because they were all there physically, so there\u2019s been no need to be there as ghosts from the future. No reason for destiny to intervene. </p>\n<p>But maybe it\u2019s more than that. Maybe it\u2019s because Zuko\u2019s going to die, right here and now, and they won\u2019t get a chance at a second bond. </p>\n<p>He squeezes his eyes shut. <em>I\u2019m sorry, guys. Look after Uncle for me.</em></p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan on the off-chance that this goes really sour?\u201d Sokka asks. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s dawn, the team standing in the growing sunlight as the Order of the White Lotus gets ready for the day around them. The four teens are waiting on breakfast. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Toph asks. </p>\n<p>He jerks a thumb at Iroh\u2019s tent. \u201cIn case <em>that</em> goes sour.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go sour,\u201d Katara argues. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>Iroh</em>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know, he\u2019s actually a decent person. But you never know. People can surprise you. I just want to be prepared with a plan for the worst case scenario.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara rolls her eyes, but Toph seems to be enjoying the mental exercise. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can fight him. He\u2019s the Dragon of the West.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the leader of the Order of the White Lotus,\u201d Suki points out. \u201cWe need him. At least until the comet\u2019s gone.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sokka grumbles. \u201cWe\u2019d probably want to wait for Aang, too. He\u2019d want to fight him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Suki says. \u201cAang and Katara can comfort Zuko while the three of us exact revenge.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes sparkle. \u201cI knew there was a reason we were dating.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat exactly would this revenge look like?\u201d Toph asks, growing even more amused. She\u2019s got that I-know-something-you-don\u2019t-know smile, but Suki doesn\u2019t know what it could be for. </p>\n<p>\u201cSimple: we target that which he loves most,\u201d Suki said, steepling her fingers. \u201cIf that\u2019s not Zuko, then it\u2019s obviously the tea shop.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka brightens. \u201cOh, yeah! We could have Toph flatten it. Or release a dozen hog-monkeys during rush hour!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you even get that many hog-monkeys?\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka and Suki both cringe and look behind them. </p>\n<p>Iroh\u2019s the one who asked the question, looking completely non-plussed at overhearing them plan to destroy his tea shop. Zuko\u2019s standing next to him, face buried in his hand. </p>\n<p>Sokka turns on Toph, who\u2019s cackling. \u201cA little warning, next time?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut this is so much more fun,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Zuko raises his head. His eyes are a little puffy, like he\u2019s been crying recently. But so are Iroh\u2019s. And both of them look relaxed and happy, even if Zuko is also incredibly annoyed. \u201cWhy are we planning on destroying Uncle\u2019s tea shop?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOn the off-chance that he turned out to secretly be a giant dick and was mean to you,\u201d Sokka says, absolutely zero apology in his tone.</p>\n<p>Zuko turns to Suki. \u201cYou approved this?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot the hog-monkeys,\u201d she admits. \u201cViper-rats would be the better choice. They\u2019re easier to get and <em>way</em> more effective.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko face-palms. Iroh laughs. </p>\n<p>Then he <em>bows</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to see my nephew found such good soulmates,\u201d he says genuinely. \u201cThank you for looking after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sudden sincerity catches everyone off-guard, except for Zuko, who\u2019s gotten over his annoyance and embarrassment enough to give them a warm smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe should be thanking Zuko,\u201d Suki says, which turns the firebender pink again.</p>\n<p>Iroh pulls out of the bow and motions for them to follow him. \u201cCome. Breakfast should be ready, and you children need to eat.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>Tying up Ozai seems a bit like overkill. He\u2019s lost his bending and can\u2019t even stand. But Sokka insists, and Suki agrees, so Toph bends some cuffs out of the airship.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko and Katara?\u201d Aang asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cDealing with Azula,\u201d Toph says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve got a pain in my shoulder and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from the marks or something else.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki stiffens. She felt a pain in her leg during the fight, but she\u2019d assumed it was because she landed wrong. Sokka, who was ordered to lie down on a cot across from the ex-Fire Lord, bolts upright and unwraps his wrist. </p>\n<p>Once he sees his marks, his brown skin turns pasty. \u201cGet us to Caldera City. Right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Toph demands as Aang and Suki rush to obey. </p>\n<p>\u201cZuko. He\u2019s fading.\u201d </p>\n<p>Someone laughs. </p>\n<p>Suki pauses on her way to the wheel. Ozai is apparently more coherent than they thought, chuckling at them. \u201cSo you\u2019re the soulmates. That makes sense. Weaklings tend to flock together.\u201d </p>\n<p>She grits her teeth. Even after seeing Zuko's entire life through their soulbond, she still doesn't understand how someone like <em>that</em> could possibly be related to their soul brother.</p>\n<p>Sokka turns his arm so the marks are visible to Ozai. The usually golden flame on his wrist is almost white. \u201cYour son is dying,\u201d he says lowly. \u201cYour daughter might be dead, too. Doesn\u2019t that mean <em>anything</em> to you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ozai shrugs. \u201cThey should have been better.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suki might not be the best at coming up with insulting names. But she can\u2014and does\u2014knock out a fully-grown man with a single punch. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Katara chains Azula to the grate and runs to Zuko. </p>\n<p>The first thing she notices is how <em>small</em> he is, curled up around his chest. It's so wrong. He's the tallest and largest of all of them, capable of wrapping his entire being around anyone to keep them warm and safe.</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t be dead,</em> she prays, turning him over and blanching at the bloody wound on his chest. <em>Don\u2019t you dare be dead.</em></p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>Everyone gets ready to leave. Master Piandao is out securing a ride for Sokka, Toph, and Suki so that Katara and Zuko can use Appa. Sokka puts on his armor, which is proving difficult. His hands won\u2019t stop shaking. </p>\n<p>On the third attempt to get the straps together, pale hands take his own. </p>\n<p>Sokka jumps, and swears. \u201cI\u2019m putting a bell around your neck, Jerkbender.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes and takes over putting on the armor. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re scared.\u201d </p>\n<p>He sputters. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not scared. What are you talking about?\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko gives him a look, and he deflates. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re scared,\u201d Zuko repeats. \u201cIt means you\u2019re not stupid.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka gives a nervous laugh. He, Toph, and Suki are about to go against several airships\u2019 worth of firebenders juiced up on a magic comet. He\u2019s fucking <em>terrified.</em></p>\n<p>On top of that, his other three soulmates are fighting either the Fire Lord, or his crazy bitch of a daughter. Any one of them could be killed today.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t more worried about Katara than\u2026really anyone else. He\u2019d be crushed if any of them died, but if Katara dies, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d <em>break</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Katara would kill me if she heard me say this\u2026\u201d he begins. </p>\n<p>Zuko smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure nothing happens to her.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka lets out a gusty sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko finishes with the straps on Sokka\u2019s armor and steps back. Sokka awkwardly rubs the back of his neck. While they\u2019re definitely friends now, he\u2019s not sure how to act in this situation. The first several months they knew each other, Zuko was <em>the</em> bad guy. The one who could take hit after hit after hit and still get back up, chasing them all over the world. When he joined the group to teach Aang firebending, he was still scary, and formidable, and not someone that anyone was particularly worried about getting hurt.</p>\n<p>But then he turned out to be their soulmate, the one firebender Sokka grudgingly liked as a kid. He\u2019d always assumed the man who saved his life at least twice by keeping him warm during blizzards and fishing mishaps was a walking, talking, fluffy blanket. </p>\n<p>Turns out, he wasn\u2019t far from the mark. Zuko\u2019s an awkward turtleduck, something Sokka finds hilarious as well as endearing. The desire to bundle him up in a dozen blankets and keep him tucked away from the world began to kindle as soon as he and Aang bonded. </p>\n<p>It turned into a raging <em>need</em> when it was Sokka\u2019s turn to soulbond with him. </p>\n<p>Which is stupid. Intellectually, Sokka knows that Zuko is just as scary, formidable, and fierce as ever. Arguably more so, now that he has something more wholesome and concrete to fight for. His bending is stronger than every before. Spirits, even without the bending, he\u2019s more dangerous than most people on the planet. </p>\n<p>So is Katara. That doesn\u2019t stop Sokka from worrying. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t die today, okay?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe kind of need you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes, and there\u2019s that self-deprecating look Sokka hates so much. \u201cWorst case scenario, Uncle Iroh takes the throne and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the fucking throne or the world or whatever,\u201d he snaps. \u201cWe need <em>you.</em> Get that through your thick, fiery skull.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko stares at him, then cracks a tiny smile. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to die today. Promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014<br>\u2014</p>\n<p>Sokka honestly can\u2019t say how long it takes them to to reach Caldera City. He spends the whole time staring at his wrist. </p>\n<p><em>Come on, Zuko,</em> he thinks, clutching his arm so hard there will definitely be bruises. <em>You promised.</em></p>\n<p>Aang is outside of the ship, using his airbending to make them go faster. Toph leans against the wall, not too far from Ozai, who\u2019s drooling on the floor from Suki\u2019s hit. Suki herself is driving the airship.</p>\n<p>The mark flickers, going from gold to gray and back again. It flickers like a real fire, or some other thematically appropriate shit. </p>\n<p>And then, suddenly, it stops. </p>\n<p>He holds his breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cSokka?\u201d Suki calls, concerned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u201d </p>\n<p>Is he crying? Sokka wipes his face and realizes that, yup, definitely crying. </p>\n<p>He looks up, grinning as he shows her his wrist. \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Zuko squeezes his eyes shut. <em>I\u2019m sorry, guys. Look after Uncle for me.</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s getting harder to breathe. Katara and Azula are still fighting. He gives himself maybe two minutes before he\u2019s dead, if he's lucky. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s when he feels it. Light, fluttery fingers tapping <em>I\u2019m here</em> over and over on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Aang.</em>\n</p>\n<p>In a blink, they\u2019re all there. Katara\u2019s curled up against his chest, cooling the burn. Suki\u2019s at his back. Sokka\u2019s holding his hand so tight he wonders if souls can leave bruises. Toph\u2019s fingers dig into his arm right under Aang. </p>\n<p>He honestly can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re physically there, or if it\u2019s the soulbond, or just his imagination. He can\u2019t hear anything anymore, his lungs are pulling in less air with every breath, and right now the only things that really process are the pain and the touch of his soulmates. </p>\n<p>It's not the worst way to go, but right now Zuko's thinking that this <em>isn't</em> the way he goes. He might just survive this, if he can keep sucking in one breath after another. </p>\n<p>He manages to force another six thin, raspy breaths--barely--before someone rolls him over. The cool feeling seeps into his chest, soothing the burns on his heart and lungs. The pain lingers, then dissipates. </p>\n<p>He takes a full breath and opens his eyes. </p>\n<p>His soulmates are gone but for Katara. The glow of the water illuminates her face until it stops, and she meets his eyes. She\u2019s smiling, and crying. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Katara,\u201d he whispers. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It still fucking hurts. </p>\n<p>Not like he\u2019s going to tell anyone else that. </p>\n<p>The first thing he asked, once he was sure Azula was secured and Katara herself was okay, was to see her soul marks so they could check the others. Her marks form a ring around her bellybutton. They\u2019re all there, vibrant and colorful and so <em>not dead.</em></p>\n<p>Now, as the airship lands in front of the palace, Zuko does his best to cover the very visible wound with the burnt remains of his shirt. It doesn\u2019t work, though, as the first thing that happens is Aang flies down and grabs him in a hug. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d he cries. </p>\n<p>\u201cAang, ow!\u201d </p>\n<p>The Avatar immediately pulls back. He tugs Zuko\u2019s shirt away, and winces, but gives a wobbly smile. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re scar buddies.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko looks him up and down. All sorts of nightmarish scenarios came to his head when he realized Aang spent the last half hour fighting Ozai, ranging from him dying to getting a burn like Zuko\u2019s to getting shot by lightning again. Even after seeing the mark on Katara confirming he was alive, that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got a few bruises and his shirt is gone. But he\u2019s fine. Not a single burn. </p>\n<p>The relief is so powerful Zuko almost falls. Katara and Aang catch him and sit him down on the edge of a little stone wall around a garden. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he mumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Aang says.</p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah! Got the Avatar State back and everything.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs everyone else okay?\u201d Katara asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Sokka broke his leg\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>The idiot in question hops out of the ship, with Suki the only thing keeping him upright. </p>\n<p>\u201cSit your ass down before you hurt yourself!\u201d Zuko orders. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>fine</em>.\u201d He hops until he\u2019s got one arm around Zuko and another around Katara. \u201cYou\u2019re both okay!\u201d </p>\n<p>Katara smiles. \u201cWe are.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka smacks Zuko over the head. \u201cDon\u2019t scare us like that again, Jerkbender.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t actually my fault! Blame Azula. She\u2019s the one who shot lightning at Katara.\u201d </p>\n<p>The waterbender winces while Sokka reels back, looking at his sister. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> okay,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause <em>somebody</em> took the hit without properly redirecting it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI redirected most of it!\u201d Zuko defends. </p>\n<p>At Katara\u2019s flat look, he amends, \u201cSome of it. Enough that I\u2019m still breathing!\u201d </p>\n<p>Sokka looks at him and seems to be about two seconds away from crying. Zuko quickly points out the broken leg to Katara, and she gets her brother lying on the wall to look it over. Suki rolls her eyes and mutters something that sounds suspiciously like, \u201cMen.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zuko looks around and frowns. \u201cWhere\u2019s Toph?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSecuring Ozai,\u201d Suki says. </p>\n<p>He blinks. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026still alive?\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a weird feeling. A part of him is relieved, which is a surprise. The other part is filled with dread. Already he can see the Fire Nation splintering as at least half of them refuse to follow him and instead flock to Ozai. The Hundred Year War might be over, but a nasty civil war is just a heartbeat away if\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI took his bending away,\u201d Aang says. </p>\n<p>Zuko stares at him. \u201cIs that a euphemism or\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s call energybending. It\u2019s really cool, and I think it might be how we got our bending in the first place. See, there\u2019s this giant lion turtle who showed me, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Sunshine!\u201d Toph calls, stepping out of the ship and metalbending something behind her. \u201cWhere do you want this?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ozai is in crude metal cuffs and has a nasty black eye. Toph drops him at Zuko\u2019s feet. </p>\n<p>Ozai bares his teeth. </p>\n<p>Zuko stares back at him. </p>\n<p>After a beat, Ozai glances around and asks, \u201cSo. Are you going to deliver the killing blow yourself, or have one of these children do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou think you\u2019re here to be executed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want, <em>Fire Lord</em>?\u201d he sneers. \u201cRevenge?\u201d </p>\n<p>No. That\u2019s what <em>Ozai</em> wants. Zuko, realizes, wants absolutely nothing to do with him. </p>\n<p>He realizes with a jolt that his father has built his entire identity around firebending: using it for power, using it for fear, using it to secure his own superiority over everyone else. Without it, he\u2019s nothing. Right now, death would be a relief. </p>\n<p>Zuko stands. Katara reaches out to steady him, but he doesn\u2019t need it. He cradles his father\u2019s head, his thumb almost touching the left eye. \u201cIf I wanted revenge, you would already be on fire.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ozai stiffens beneath his hand. His soulmates\u2014his family\u2014hold their breath. </p>\n<p>Zuko pulls away. \u201cToph, you know where the prison is?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo me a favor and take him there. Make sure to warp the lock until I know the guards can be trusted.\"</p>\n<p>She does it without question.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Iroh finds him later, after he\u2019s been properly bandaged. </p>\n<p>The entire soul family is in the palace. Zuko could have claimed the royal chambers for himself and given everyone else lavish guest rooms, but they decided against it. Iroh stumbles upon them all in one of the audience chambers. Mattresses, blankets and pillows litter the ground. Some are haphazardly thrown, while others\u2014namely the ones supporting Sokka\u2019s broken leg\u2014are carefully placed. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re all dog-piled on one another, each child touching at least two of their soulmates. Zuko is sandwiched between Katara and Sokka. All of them are asleep. </p>\n<p>Iroh smiles, and leaves the room, ordering the servants not to let them be disturbed until morning, at least. They deserve the rest.</p>"
