  "notes": "<p>im gonna go ahead and assume you've already read the fic this was inspired by (if not then do that and come back here later it's amazing and also i don't provide context) but if you haven't then it's the gaang as time travelling soulmate ghosts.

I've not got anything about this series there, but if you wanna drop me an ask about it or whatever... https://www.tumblr.com/blog/foiblepnoteworthy</p>\n<p>first of all im sorry that i keep just adding more chapters to my estimate. this is a problem for me as much as it is for you. i think its gonna stay where it is now tho, if its any consolation.</p>\n<p>also warnings for a panic attack btw</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>kudos comment subscribe because This Will Not End and was meant to be finished already but oh well</p>\n<p>(*bats eyelashes at regulars with an expression that verges on inappropriate but isn't /quite/ inappropriate enough that you can call me out on it* Hello, my darlings.)</p>\n<p>oh yeah and I'm pretty sure that you're not meant to do what katara did if someone's having a panic attack (like yeah untying him is a good move but she should probably have stayed out of his space). I just took authorial liberties and also they're soulmates and identify each other by touch so...</p>\n<p>I have strict enough plans for the next 2 chapters that they should be all i need and i wont have to add any more but who even knows anymore. maybe I'll end up squishing the two chapters into one, idk what im doing anymore</p>\n<p>hey. hey. look at the chapter count. it hasn't changed for once. i might actually only have one chapter left. that's so soothing</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>kudos comment subscribe we have one chapter left yo guys just ONE MORE CHAPTER AND THEN I'M FREE WHY DID I DO THIS<br>(hello my regulars i see you and i love you and i cherish you and i will answer comments this time i swear I'm getting better at it)</p>\n<p>next chapter will be Sunday or sooner depending on when it is written (but latest is Sunday don't worry)</p>\n<p>In other news i went back to updating the guilt series every two weeks instead of weekly and this thing is almost finished which means I'll finally get back to the non-evil twin woot woot (the first series mentioned is soft emotions, trauma, and theatre and the second is the dumbest funking comedy istg you'll like it i promise) because otherwise I'll run out of new content and therefore validation from comments</p>\n<p>Tumblr, where i really need to do some sort of art for this (what should i do please tell me i cant think of anything): https://foiblepnoteworthy.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>*inhales* *screams internally*<br>Two reasons to be screaming today. The first one you've probably already noticed. There is still another chapter to go. I am losing all faith in everything.

I have a few nice ideas for (hopeful) one-shot fics, but i also need to finish a wolf in wolf and the non-evil twin series in general. I've been thinking about going back to the turtleduck fic also, maybe making a little season one shaped arc and finding some way to call it finished. Or should i be looking at guilt and making sure I've got enough pre-written chapters to avoid a haitus?</p>\n<p>tldr what do you want me to work on after I finish this fic, which will update on sunday/every Sunday (i want there to be one chapter but i am not a complete idiot so)<br>(Yes that is also me plugging my other works; almost everything I write is avatar so there's stuff you'll like there, i promise. it ranges from comedy to found family to romance and Zuko is always the main character)</p>\n<p>Here is my Tumblr it's just doodles of my fics and occasional updates on my works.

Like in a few months or something. i really need to get back to the non-evil twin (which i hope to have an update for within two weeks :) it will be more fucking with jet but that's what y'all want anyway so...)</p>\n<p>seriously tho its been so cool to have so many readers on this; this is my most popular fic at time of writing and the response i got was actually insane. I love you guys and i want you to stick around and i swear i mostly just do avatar so...</p>\n<p>come and tell my what scenes i should illustrate on my Tumblr: https://foiblepnoteworthy.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>Hi there!

  "text": "<p>Aang was born with five marks on his forearm. He grew up with five ghosts protecting and comforting him in equal measure, and eagerly awaited the day he would finally meet them.</p>\n<p>He found two of them \u2013 the boomerang and the strange swirls - the day after he came out of the iceberg. His soulmates both bore the same fan, eye and crossed swords as him.</p>\n<p>Sat in a bison saddle, high up above a wrecked Fire Nation ship, the trio knew that it would only be a matter of time before the six of them were together.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko resisted the urge to hum the Blue Spirit theme as he clung to the bottom of a cart entering the Pohuai Stronghold. He was a professional, and that would definitely get him caught.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t help that one of his soulmates was tapping out one of the beats on his arm. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what they were doing there in the first place.</p>\n<p>(He was glad for the company, much as he pretended otherwise, even to himself. If he failed or was <em>caught</em>\u2026 It was always nice to have a constant assurance that he wasn\u2019t minutes away from dying.)</p>\n<p>It was child\u2019s play to slip past the guards, and only a little harder to take out the quartet guarding the Avatar\u2019s cell. He wasn't sure whether to take pride in his abilities or to fear for the safety of his nation.</p>\n<p>He entered the cell to the oh-so-satisfying sight of the Avatar in chains. He only allowed himself aa half-second to savour it, not wanting the boy to guess his intentions, before leaping to free him \u2013 with a little flair thrown in to scare the slippery brat.</p>\n<p>The Avatar, strangely enough, was more awed by than scared of his swords. Zuko hid his irritation; it was better that he trusted him, for the moment at least. It shouldn't matter that he couldn't even scare a twelve-year-old right.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you here to rescue me?\u201d the boy asked, head tilted up to see him, eyes overlarge in his small body.</p>\n<p>Zuko stayed silent \u2013 he\u2019d recognise his voice \u2013 and gestured for him to follow him with his swords. The Avatar followed the movement a little too closely, and went with him without protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d The boy knelt in the next room, already becoming a problem. \u201cMy frogs!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>What? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMy friends-\u201d the boy cut himself off abruptly, looking between Zuko and the frogs. Zuko took advantage of his hesitation and dragged him away, ignoring his protests. They needed to get out of there.</p>\n<p>(Was he was always like this around 'allies'?)</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Aang knew those swords. He\u2019d seen them every day, felt the warm, if rough, presence of their owner in all his hardest moments and coldest flights. He was a strong figure, gentle in his own way. A Firebender who still used swords.</p>\n<p>The stranger hadn\u2019t acknowledged their bond, but why else would he be there? It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence that someone with those swords \u2013 dual dao, Sokka had called them, with blue handles \u2013 had appeared out of nowhere to rescue him.</p>\n<p>Maybe the stranger wanted to wait until later. Maybe he somehow hadn\u2019t realised that the arrow was Aang \u2013 it had taken Katara and Sokka a minute too.</p>\n<p>(<em>It was in the middle of his forehead,</em> he couldn't help but grump.<em> It wasn\u2019t exactly subtle.</em>)</p>\n<p>Maybe the stranger wasn\u2019t his soulmate. But maybe he\u2019d know someone else with swords like that? Somehow?</p>\n<p>Hidden in a water system beneath the prison, the pair had a minute to talk while that waited for a patrol to move.</p>\n<p>He had to at least<em> ask,</em> even if the stranger wasn't going to mention it.</p>\n<p>Aang pulled up his sleeve to reveal the familiar marks. He traced Katara and Sokka; promised himself he wouldn\u2019t be much longer in getting back to them.</p>\n<p>The stranger had turned his head away the second Aang revealed his marks. That was polite but it wasn't what Aang wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Aang whispered, pointing to the swords. The stranger turned; reluctance clear in the set of his shoulders.</p>\n<p>He froze, masked head tilted towards Aang's arm.</p>\n<p>(He generally seemed to move very cautiously, but the complete stillness was unusual for him, Aang thought.)</p>\n<p>The silence stretched on as the stranger stared at the swords.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have an arrow?\u201d Aang asked, when it became clear that the stranger wasn\u2019t going to react.</p>\n<p>Trembling fingers untucked a black tunic, pulling it up to reveal-</p>\n<p>Aang felt sick. The scar ran from his ribcage to beneath his waistband. It was vaguely hand-shaped, but no hand would be <em>that</em> huge, how could\u2026 who did that?</p>\n<p>The scar was pink and faded; long since healed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d Aang asked.</p>\n<p>The stranger looked away, tucking his tunic back in and hiding the scar.</p>\n<p>Aang still didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d had the arrow or not. He had to have seen them before he... <em>before.</em> He had to know what they looked like. No one would do that to a little kid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But two minutes ago he would never have guessed that someone would burn off someone\u2019s soulmarks.</p>\n<p>There had to be a reason why he had shown Aang his scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what they look like.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at the stranger, silently begging him to prove him wrong.</p>\n<p>The stranger shook his head.</p>\n<p>Aang did the only thing he could think of.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The Avatar was <em>hugging</em> him.</p>\n<p>The Avatar. Hugging.</p>\n<p>His mortal enemy.</p>\n<p><strike>His soulm-</strike> No. He couldn\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t be such a terrible soulmate that he would\u2026 He hadn\u2019t been <em>hunting </em>his <em>soulmate</em>.</p>\n<p>(Soulmate<em>s</em>, plural. The boomerang and the swirls; they had to be the Water Tribe peasants.)</p>\n<p>The Avatar touched his swords.</p>\n<p>Zuko recoiled, his mind finally having caught up enough to push the boy away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can touch blood,\u201d the boy said, promises and pity and care in his eyes and Zuko didn\u2019t <strike>deserve</strike> <em>want</em> any of it. \u201cThen you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reached for his swords again, ignoring Zuko\u2019s shaking head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s you,\u201d the boy insisted. \u201cThere are six of us, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strike>(Five bodies held him on his worst nights.)</strike>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko stepped back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ll do it eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not with <em>him</em>. Not with his enemy.</p>\n<p>(What would he even do if it <em>was</em> him? He couldn\u2019t hunt his soulmate \u2013 couldn\u2019t <em>have been</em> hunt<em>ing </em>his soulmate either. Surely fate wouldn\u2019t be so cruel.)</p>\n<p>The boy looked at him with stars in his eyes. He was standing too close, but Zuko didn't find it in himself to mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter,\u201d he heard himself say in a roughened voice.</p>\n<p>The boy nodded. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair, it\u2019s <em>exhausting</em>. But you have to <em>promise</em> you\u2019ll at least try it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy held one of his hands between his two, eyes beseeching.</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded, then, before the boy could say anything more, pulled them up and out of the tunnel to make their escape.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d have to find some way out of their promise. But later.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Those familiar swords were cold against his throat. Aang swallowed, unsure of whether or not he should look afraid \u2013 unsure of whether or not he <em>felt</em> afraid. His soulmate could kill him with a slip of his hand, and they needed that Zhao guy to believe that he would.</p>\n<p>But they were out the doors. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer before they could join blood and he could get to know his soulmate.</p>\n<p>(It was him; he could <em>feel</em> it.)</p>\n<p>Aang didn\u2019t see the arrow coming until it was too late.</p>\n<p>He <em>did</em> see the face beneath the mask.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko dealt with a lot of terrible things - that was just his life. It made him an expert in awful. He had a phD in getting punched in the face both physically and metaphorically. He\u2019d practically made a career in falling down hills only to land in rivers only to be attacked by hippogators.</p>\n<p>This meant that he could certifiably say that his current situation was the absolute <em>worst</em> without anyone being able to refute it.</p>\n<p>First off, he had a headache. A really bad one too, the kind that made you almost throw up but you never actually do so you\u2019re just anxious and uncomfortable for several hours without the relief of just <em>ending</em> it.</p>\n<p>Secondly, his wrists and ankles were bound. With <em>rope</em>. He\u2019d be even more offended if they hadn\u2019t tied his palms on his elbows, so he couldn\u2019t actually burn them off without setting himself on fire.</p>\n<p>(The fact that the good knotmanship and clear effort in his captivity sated his ego was a smaller, but no less awful, thing he had to deal with.)</p>\n<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, The Avatar was a scant three feet away from him, and he had no way of getting to him. Every time he spotted him, some reflex tripped in the back of his mind telling him to <em>go</em> and <em>hunt</em> and <em>catch that tiny child</em>. This happened every few minutes.</p>\n<p>(The fourth and actual worst part of all of this was the part where the child he had been hunting could be one of his soulmates. If Zuko couldn\u2019t get out of there quickly enough, there was a not-insignificant chance that the Avatar would force them to join blood to try and make him switch sides.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if he had to make that decision.)</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Water Tribe siblings came to, spluttering and yelling at Aang.</p>\n<p>First about the frogs.</p>\n<p>Then about Zuko and his general existence.</p>\n<p>(Zuko kept his eyes shut. Better they think he\u2019s not listening. Maybe he could get a clue about where they were going next.</p>\n<p>Or about what they thought of him as their potential soulmate.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAang, that\u2019s rope!\u201d the brother exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a <em>firebender</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you kidnap Zuko?\u201d the waterbender asked, only confusion in her tone. \u201cIt\u2019s a little\u2026 backwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Thank you!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot backwards,\u201d Sokka agreed. \u201cWhat would we even <em>do</em> with a Fire Prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was captured by Zhao last night,\u201d The Avatar told them. \u201cZuko broke me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The siblings paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make him your friend, Aang,\u201d the boy said, cautious.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aang agreed, \u201cBut these might.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko heard a clink of metal. The siblings let out small noises of shock and dismay.</p>\n<p>There was a rustling as the waterbender climbed out of her sleeping bag to look closer. \u201cThese are his?\u201d There was no mistaking the awe in her voice - nor the bizarre hope.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pshaw</em>,\u201d her brother scoffed, unconvinced. \u201cThey\u2019re good fakes, but he must have seen our marks at some point. He\u2019s just trying to trick us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t use firebending at all last night,\u201d the Avatar said. \u201cJust his swords. He was pretending not to be Zuko \u2013 he had a mask and everything. And he knew how to fight with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAang\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe fought well together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you try to join blood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wanted to wait \u2018til after.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want you to know that you\u2019re not soulmates and he\u2019s trying to manipulate you. It\u2019s a dirty trick; but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from the Fire Nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>How dare he-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko was so sick of this. He just wanted to go back to his ship.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d Zuko said, pulling himself halfway upright (which here means <em>\u2018onto his side because that really was some quality knotwork\u2019</em>) and glaring at them, \u201cwould be in no way honourable. Just because we\u2019re mortal enemies doesn\u2019t mean you have to insult me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Water Tribe boy blinked at him. \u201cYes, it does. What\u2019s the point in having a mortal enemy if you don\u2019t make fun of his terrible awful ugly ponytail?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve resisted the urge with you so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>He squawked, sputtering incoherently. \u201cThis is a warrior\u2019s-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka,\u201d his sister placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, though her expression was unsympathetic.</p>\n<p>The boy \u2013 Sokka \u2013 reeled on him again, his voice only getting higher and louder and worse on Zuko\u2019s headache. \u201cStop trying to distract us!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who insulted my Phoenix Tail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretending to be our soulmate!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko flinched. The fact that they thought the swords matched their mark was\u2026 not good for him. Maybe he could convince them it was on purpose and they wouldn\u2019t try anything \u2013 but faking a soul connection was just\u2026 what kind of person would do something like that? He wouldn\u2019t even pretend to stoop that low.</p>\n<p>(And what if it<em> was</em> them? Shouldn\u2019t he try to fix things now, before he wronged them even more?)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he protested. \u201cThose are <em>my</em> swords. They just happen to look like your soulmarks. I wasn\u2019t trying to trick you \u2013 give me <em>some</em> measure of credit.\u201d They looked unconvinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know about your marks until the Avatar showed me last night,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>The waterbender got a strange look in her eye. She stepped forwards, and sat cross-legged a few feet from Zuko. Even sitting down, she was a lot higher up than he was comfortable with in his vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>He puffed out a mouthful of flames in warning, and got a raised eyebrow in return.</p>\n<p>(Her brother waved his arms in frustration and panic behind them, but didn\u2019t intervene. The Avatar watched with undisguised fascination.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know they would match our marks?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt really <em>was</em> a coincidence?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snarled. \u201cI may be your enemy, but I still have lines I wouldn\u2019t cross. I\u2019d appreciate it immensely,\u201d and how it stung to ask a favour of his enemies, \u201cif you would just let this go \u2013 and let <em>me</em> go while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave a half-hearted tug at his bonds for emphasis. His shoulders were starting to ache.</p>\n<p>She moved closer. \u201cWhere are your soulmarks?\u201d</p>\n<p>His blood froze. He bared his teeth and said in a hiss, \u201cDon\u2019t you <em>dare</em> touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wrestled with his bonds again; to no avail, as before. She placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have matching marks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d He pulled back, trying to free himself from her grip or the rope. Both held tight. \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re scarred over,\u201d the Avatar said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou shut up!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sok- the Water Tribe boy looked over in half-interest, half-horror, eyes wide and brow furrowed. \u201cWhat does that even <em>mean</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe showed me last ni-\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko let loose a stream of fire from his mouth, cutting off the conversation.</p>\n<p>The trio continued talking quietly, at a safe distance. Try as he might, Zuko couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying.</p>\n<p>The fact that they were even <em>considering</em> it made his stomach churn.</p>\n<p>(It couldn\u2019t be them. He wouldn\u2019t <em>let it</em> be them.)</p>\n<p>The Avatar and the waterbender both seemed in agreement about something, nodding when the other spoke and standing shoulder to shoulder; but the Water Tribe boy was vehemently against whatever it was, with dramatic head shaking and arm flailing. Either the group worked unanimously, or the boy had some sort of leadership role given by his age or gender.</p>\n<p>Zuko knew that if the trio offered hi some sort of peace based in these soulmarks that would only aid him in his goal to capture the Avatar. That idea should be the only thing he thought about.</p>\n<p>He was far more concerned about what might happen if they did force him to join blood.</p>\n<p>(What if it really was them? If they\u2019d found him against all odds? The fact that they were discussing it surely meant that he would have a chance, right?)</p>\n<p>Eventually, the waterbender broke off from their group, ignoring their protests, and grabbed a small knife from a huge selection of random objects that he could only assume they\u2019d stolen, for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>She was walking towards him holding a knife. That wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>He managed not to flinch when she sat next to him again, but it was a near thing. Her knife sliced into her palm first, before she reached for his arm, throwing a handful of water in his face when he tried his breath of fire again.</p>\n<p>The knife dug in. There was a hand, soft and soothing on the wound.</p>\n<p>His vision was overwhelmed by white.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bright white of the blood joining faded quickly, as it always did, and Katara found herself in a strange red room. Women bustled around her, disguising panic under strenuous work, while another was laid out in a hospital bed, a bundle clutched to her chest. The white sheets were stained a stark red.</p>\n<p>Katara crouched, looking for any figures she could see at knee height, presuming Zuko to be quite short and at a young age. She knew she was there for a reason, and knew he must have been there a well, but she couldn\u2019t-</p>\n<p>The bundle gave out the sharp cry of a newborn, startling Katara. She\u2019d never heard of someone meeting their soulmate at such a tender age, but there was no other sign of little Zuko.</p>\n<p>He was quickly soothed by the woman - his mother, she had to be \u2013 and burbled, wriggling to try to sit up and look around the room. He was curious; bright-eyed and smiley. Sweet.</p>\n<p>Katara looked at the baby, and couldn\u2019t withhold a rush of emotion. There was no way this baby could ever turn evil.</p>\n<p>(So what had happened?)</p>\n<p>He was Zuko, and Katara should probably actually think about that. But what was there to say? He\u2019d been hunting them like animals halfway across the world, but had also rescued Aang last night, but was the <em>Firelord\u2019s</em> son, but used to be a teeny tiny baby and kept her warm in the winter.</p>\n<p>He spoke a lot about honour. Maybe he really did think he was doing the right thing?</p>\n<p>(He\u2019d struggled, desperate, his good eye white all around with fear, when he saw the knife and realised what she was going to do. She couldn\u2019t shake the image, even watching his unrecognisable infant self. But how else could she have verified their bond?)</p>\n<p>The door slid open, unheralded by any knock, and two men stepped inside: one wizened and stern in his expression, beginning to hunch over with age; the other far younger, head high and hair perfectly groomed.</p>\n<p>All the women, Zuko\u2019s mother included, bowed towards the men, several kneeling. There were reverent greetings of \u201cYour Majesty\u201d and \u201cYour Highness,\u201d explaining why those men thought they were allowed in a women\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>Katara looked with new eyes at the Firelords of past and present. Their expressions betrayed no joy at the birth of their son and grandson. The younger man - <em>Ozai</em>, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 stepped forwards to inspect Zuko, not bothering to take him from his wife\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d he asked, no interest in his tone. Was this some bizarre Fire Nation custom? Perhaps Zuko was born weak, and they were trying not to get attached in case he didn\u2019t make it. He did look a little smaller than most new babies she had helped Gran-Gran deliver, and there was far more blood than Katara was used to seeing after births.</p>\n<p>Behind them, the nurses and medics scampered out of the room, even though the woman was clearly still weak from her ordeal.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoy,\u201d the woman replied, warmth at war with something else in her expression. It made Katara shiver, despite her half-incorporeal form.</p>\n<p>Ozai leaned over to look at Zuko again, this time taking him from his wife\u2019s arms. Her smile froze, watching him hold their son. Ozai didn\u2019t seem to know how to hold a baby \u2013 either that or he didn\u2019t care. He held Zuko under his arms, studying his face intently.</p>\n<p>Zuko reached for his nose with one little chubby hand, gurgling happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking of calling him Zuko,\u201d the women said, \u201cFor my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>The older Firelord approached, scrutinizing tiny Zuko. He let out a little <em>hmph</em> of disapproval.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny marks?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>The women took a short fortifying breath, struggling to hide her confusing fear in her own exhaustion. \u201cHe has five of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ozai turned his gaze from Zuko to his wife. \u201cThen they\u2019ll make do easily without him,\u201d he said, and walked around the bed to a small window, most likely there to provide ventilation in the Fire Nation\u2019s muggy heat.</p>\n<p>He showed Zuko the outside \u2013 showed him the sun, perhaps? Another Fire Nation custom? \u2013 then held him out just a little too far.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(No.)</em>\n</p>\n<p>The woman lurched upwards, struggled to her feet. She swayed, clutching the bed posts for support, and would surely collapse if she took a step closer to Ozai.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d her tone was polite and gentle, completely opposed to her deathly pale skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll give me a heart attack holding him like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She forced a small chuckle, reaching out her hands for Zuko, who made grabby hands back at her. Ozai didn\u2019t return him to her increasingly insistent arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no spark,\u201d Ozai said, cold. \u201cIn his eye nor his spirit. I doubt he will be a Firebender. His birth disgraces us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman gasped \u2013 not in shock, she had clearly seen this coming, but because she seemed to have been holding her breath in fear.</p>\n<p>Her legs shook at the effort of keeping her upright. Ozai was stood six paces away from her, well out of arm\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p>Zuko reached for his mother again, beginning to fuss when he wasn\u2019t handed over.</p>\n<p>Katara soothed him with a gentle hand on his forehead, and told herself that he had to survive this, because otherwise she\u2019d never have met him.</p>\n<p>She wondered again why she was being shown this. She swallowed and watched Ozai, tall and cold and intimidating even when carrying his infant son, and dreaded to think what Zuko\u2019s childhood had been like \u2013 she\u2019d find out soon enough, she supposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is little point in wasting an heir now that he\u2019s here,\u201d The older Firelord said, admonishment in his otherwise indifferent tone. He didn\u2019t look the slightest bit perturbed by Ozai\u2019s intentions. \u201cWe shall see whether or not he is worth keeping when he is older. He may still be a bender.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman almost collapsed onto the bed, settling herself against the headboard so she could watch both the Firelord at the window and the Firelord at the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is his marks,\u201d the old man said, his lip raised in a sneer, \u201cThat I take issue with. Connections like that only make a person weak. Give him here,\u201d he crooked a finger at his son, who came over to him and held Zuko within his reach.</p>\n<p>He began undoing the bundle of blankets that held baby Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are the marks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis stomach,\u201d the woman answered, trying again to stand up, craning her neck to see what they were doing to her baby.</p>\n<p>Or maybe just to see the marks one last time.</p>\n<p>Zuko cooed at the flames in his grandfather\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Everything went white again at the first hiccupping wail.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko was four-ish and climbing a tree. The stubborn pout was so charmingly familiar. It seemed that Zuko brought his determination to everything he did.</p>\n<p>He also brought his recklessness by the looks of things \u2013 he was way too high up. Shouldn\u2019t there be someone watching him? What if he \u2013 there it is.</p>\n<p>Tiny Zuko sniffed on the ground. Someone came forward to check on him, gently helping him up and checking him over. Katara gently rubbed at his cheek, to his evident confusion. (Did he know he had soulmates? Did he even know what soulmates were?)</p>\n<p>His father came outside and watched his son with an irritated expression.</p>\n<p>Katara couldn\u2019t attack anyone like this, couldn\u2019t do anything to protect Zuko \u2013 technically her mortal enemy, but also her soulmate and <em>a baby</em> \u2013 so she just did what she could to comfort him and pushed down her anger. It wasn\u2019t what Zuko needed right now.</p>\n<p>Zuko ran off and the world glowed again.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>She watched him in little snippets, often there to cool his injuries brought about by childish exploration and dangerous training alike. He chattered to her whenever they were alone, sometimes about a pretty bug he saw that day, sometimes about the ways he wanted to help his people when he was older.</p>\n<p>More than once she found him sneaking turtleducks into his room or trying to coax the lizard dogs into games of fetch.</p>\n<p>He grew older and his face and mannerisms took shape \u2013 he looked more and more like the person she knew, but was still so alien at times. He was a very expressive child, and she recognised his older self in that; he liked to study theatre scrolls long after he should have been asleep, and practise saying the lines dramatically. Once or twice she recognised a line from something he\u2019d said while hunting them, and couldn\u2019t supress a giggle.</p>\n<p>(How had she never seen it before? Zuko was a <em>dork</em>.)</p>\n<p>He tried hard at everything he did, even as his younger sister outpaced him with ease. He never gave up, regardless of everything that stood between him and his goals. She recognised that trait easily.</p>\n<p>Some things \u2013 most things, admittedly \u2013 she learned were new. He loved his father dearly, despite his numerous and well-documented flaws, but he was definitely a mama\u2019s boy.</p>\n<p>His mother \u2013 Ursa \u2013 was an interesting person. She absolutely doted on Zuko, but struggled to make time for Azula (and who knew that Zuko had a <em>sister</em>?) despite her clearly needing more affection than she was getting. Katara suspected this had something to do with her being Ozai\u2019s favourite, even though this only meant Azula was more at risk than Zuko in several ways.</p>\n<p>Katara wouldn\u2019t deny that the little girl unsettled her, and fit her mental image for Fire Nation far better than Zuko ever could have hoped to (even before she saw him get stuck up a tree trying to help a raccoon cat get out); but none of that would justify leaving her to Ozai\u2019s rare smiles and sinister encouragements.</p>\n<p>Katara tried to ignore the selective parenting in favour of just being thankful that someone was looking out for Zuko.</p>\n<p>And then, suddenly, nobody was.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d thought the worst part of that day was watching Zuko break down over the death of his cousin. Several other hands joined her in comforting him.</p>\n<p>She was confused but grateful when she wasn\u2019t dragged away to see the next incident; to see the next horrible thing that happened to him (because she\u2019d found, increasingly soas he grew taller and smiled less, that she was always sent to Zuko when he was hurt and upset and injured, and rarely saw him just to visit him).</p>\n<p>She rather missed watching him cuddling turtleducks and reading out villainous lines.</p>\n<p>She saw his grandfather, Azulon, again, for the first time since Zuko\u2019s birth, and wondered how many times Zuko had seen him in that time span.</p>\n<p>(She thought back to her village, where a day wouldn\u2019t go by without her seeing Gran-Gran. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko seemed to only see his father every few days, and never received a kind word from him.)</p>\n<p>She found herself surrounded by her soulmates again, as Zuko curled in a ball on his bed, chanting, \u201cAzula always lies,\u201d as if the evil of his sister would become a comfort, instead of trying to do something to protect himself from a threat he refused to believe in.</p>\n<p>(She felt Sokka pushing Zuko towards his window, the two soulmates she hadn\u2019t met yet each tugging on his arms, but he was unmoved.)</p>\n<p>He had to survive, she reminded herself, just as she had at his birth, because she had met him.</p>\n<p>He would be okay.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>His mother was missing and his grandfather was dead. Zuko refused to look into that, to look at what they meant, and asked again where his mother had gone.</p>\n<p>His sister\u2019s words were happy in the face of his dismay; his father ignored him unless berating him for one \u2018failure\u2019 or another.</p>\n<p>Zuko tried harder and slept less and didn\u2019t eat if he didn\u2019t master his katas and lessons. Whenever he learned to manage his workload, it doubled spitefully.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t complain.</p>\n<p>He received only harsh words.</p>\n<p>He tried harder.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Katara hadn\u2019t thought much about the old man who followed Zuko around like a fussy mother turtleduck. He seemed a strong fighter, from the few occasions he got involved; and was gentle in his tone, with a sense of humour Zuko lacked.</p>\n<p>His soothing aura was in perfect balance to Zuko\u2019s own temper, she saw in reflection.</p>\n<p>The man lacked Zuko\u2019s predatory presence, and thus was never Katara\u2019s focus when she saw him, but she knew him to be sturdy and reliable - everything Zuko needed from an adult. She\u2019d rather been looking forward to seeing him when she realised he was Zuko\u2019s uncle; when she realised he was coming home to him at a time that Zuko desperately needed a real parent.</p>\n<p>She hoped what she\u2019d thought she\u2019d seen, in uncaring glances between battles, was what Zuko would get.</p>\n<p>The small man \u2013 always short, but he\u2019d been stout and solid \u2013 was made of tissue paper and steam. He was a bad day away from collapsing completely.</p>\n<p>He watched Zuko with undisguised pain during their few tea picnics, friendly and happy and kind until he remembered who he was talking to \u2013 who he <em>wasn\u2019t</em> talking to \u2013 and went silent and empty again.</p>\n<p>Iroh had lost his son at the front. Might have seen it happen. He was entirely justified to be lost in grief. She\u2019d seen the same thing in her father after her mother\u2019s death \u2013 she and Gran-Gran had held the family together on those days dad just couldn\u2019t get out of bed.</p>\n<p>Not to mention that she hadn\u2019t seen the old man interacting with Zuko before; it was entirely possible that they weren\u2019t close when Zuko was younger.</p>\n<p>Iroh wasn\u2019t obligated to Zuko, and he really was doing better with him than Ozai was. It had to hurt to spend time with someone who must resemble his own son, like rubbing salt in an old wound.</p>\n<p>Zuko left another picnic despondent and lonelier than before he\u2019d gone, and Katara vowed to punch the old man in the face.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko, Katara had been surprised to find, was an idealist. He wanted to make everybody happy, and believed he could find some way to do it, if only he was \u2018better\u2019.</p>\n<p>He was shocked, that day in the War Room, to find that others, his elders and leaders and apparent \u2018betters\u2019, were not the same.</p>\n<p>Zuko did as Zuko would always do: He tried to fix things, had limited success, and made things difficult for himself.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The Agni Kai arena was filled to the brim with curious spectators, lit from above with a glaring sun.</p>\n<p>Zuko was thirteen, and set to battle a general. His competitor would be past his prime, for sure, but prowess in bending related to skill far more than it did to health. Zuko\u2019s youthful ease of movement would be of limited help, and his inexperience would be a hindrance against his expert opponent.</p>\n<p>Zuko was thirteen. His scar was years old.</p>\n<p>She placed a hand on his shoulder, joined by everyone else, and told herself that he would need her, that she couldn\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>His competitor stood. It wasn\u2019t the old man.</p>\n<p>Of course it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Zuko shuddered in her grip, knelt, and begged for mercy.</p>\n<p>She protected his face with formless hands.</p>\n<p>He screamed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Three years of injuries and failures and missions and anger lead him to the South Pole.</p>\n<p>Iroh was there, finally, as Zuko needed and as she had seen. He should have been there before, but he had clearly recognised that himself. He channelled his new grief into Zuko\u2019s happiness, fleeting as it was.</p>\n<p>Maybe she didn\u2019t need to punch him; he beat himself up enough on long nights, watching over Zuko and soothing him through nightmares.</p>\n<p>In the early days and weeks when his scar was raw, Zuko leaned into her cooling touch. But as time passed and the relief was no longer useful, he seemed to only feel a hand over his eye. He</p>\n<p>flinched at her lightest touches.</p>\n<p>She shook out the sting, stayed away from his face, and held him tighter on the harsh nights.</p>\n<p>She saw the South Pole, saw his mad chase across the Earth Kingdom; his desperate panic when Aang was captured. She gave him a little push when he snuck out the porthole, and he gave her a smile in return.</p>\n<p>The world faded into white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katara was stood over Zuko\u2019s prone form. The shock of returning to her body was always the same, but she was accustomed enough to shake it off easily; rubbing down her limbs and pushing away the imaginary pins and needles.</p>\n<p>(She\u2019d been kneeling for a few seconds at most, even as she\u2019d been in there for months.)</p>\n<p>The shock of emotion, when she finally processed everything and felt things properly, would take a little longer to come.</p>\n<p>She looked down at Zuko, who was taking a little longer to come back to himself. Laid on his right side, his scar was bright and angry and clear.</p>\n<p>Perfectly preserved in her mind\u2019s eye \u2013 she\u2019d refused to look away, felt she owed him that at least \u2013 was the screaming child she couldn\u2019t protect. She saw the bright-eyed boy who wanted to do everything and help everyone and go everywhere.</p>\n<p>She knew who he was, at his centre: a good person who\u2019d been bullied out of doing the right thing. He was her soulmate, <em>their</em> soulmate, even if he wasn\u2019t ready to be.</p>\n<p>She would help him get there.</p>\n<p>She could barely recognise that little boy, cheerful and sad according to his parents\u2019 whims. He was <em>angry</em>, burning and overflowing with it. He couldn\u2019t risk a more vulnerable emotion.</p>\n<p>He blurred before her eyes; sobs caught in her throat.</p>\n<p>Zuko came back to himself with a cut-off gasp, enough to start cursing and struggling again, more desperate than before. He screamed and fought, good eye red with emotion, and Katara fumbled with the knife, holding his shoulder gently. She\u2019d have to hold him still before she could cut the ropes.</p>\n<p>Someone took the knife from her hand, while gentle arms wrapped around her and pulled her away. She didn\u2019t want to leave Zuko while he was so upset, but figured it was best to let one of the boys untie him instead. She wasn\u2019t too prideful to admit that it would take her too long in her state. (At least, not to herself.)</p>\n<p>She and Aang curled up against Appa as Zuko raged and Sokka spoke to him quietly. Flashed of flame appeared occasionally, accompanied by shouts from both boys, as Zuko refused to calm.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka was <em>touching him</em> and Katara was gone and she didn\u2019t matter anyway but he needed Sokka to just <em>leave him alone</em>.</p>\n<p>Another burst of fire pushed the boy away, finally, to talk with the others next to Appa. Zuko took advantage of the relative safety to relax against the cool stone and catch his breath. He took stock of the situation; it was awful.</p>\n<p>Katara was upset. She was sobbing, bawling, in complete misery. It shouldn\u2019t matter to him, but she was upset and it was his fault for landing her with a soulmate like him.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like he could help it! It wasn\u2019t his fault that she had to deal with him \u2013 he hadn\u2019t wanted to soulbond in the first place. She forced them to be soulmates.</p>\n<p>(He was careful not to think too much about what he had seen in her life \u2013 her protective brother and caring grandmother and loving father. Her father never struck her or her brother, and always had a kind word and a hug for both of them, regardless of their achievements or failures. It was like their abilities didn\u2019t even matter to him.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t like to think of their village either \u2013 he\u2019d assumed it was some sort of minor outpost when he\u2019d been there before, rather than one of a few scattered remnants of the Water Tribe. No one had told him she was the last Southern Waterbender.</p>\n<p>The Fire Nation was supposed to be sharing their greatness with the rest of the world, but the Water Tribe was struggling to survive.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t understand.)</p>\n<p>It had to be some sort of trick \u2013 some Avatar magic to make their enemy believe they had to be allies. Somehow.</p>\n<p>(He knew no magic could imitate a soulbond, not even the immense power of the Avatar.)</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t \u2013 they couldn\u2019t actually be\u2026</p>\n<p>Leaving. They were leaving and he was still trapped there and he didn\u2019t know what to say to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he tried, forcing rage into his tone to cover anything else he may have been feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike we\u2019d tell you,\u201d Sokka scoffed. Zuko was hurt by his disgust, flinching minutely, then surprised with himself for caring.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka?\u201d Katara turned to him, pausing in packing up their sleeping bags. \u201cWhy would it matter \u2013 he\u2019s coming with us, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko froze. They\u2026 they wanted him?</p>\n<p>\n<em>It couldn\u2019t be that simple.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sokka looked at him, brow furrowed. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Was he?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d he ordered, \u201cAnd then we can talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you can fry us to a crisp \u2013 no thanks.\u201d Sokka held his boomerang loosely, but defence was clear in his posture. \u201cDo you <em>want</em> to come with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hesitated.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple enough question.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was not a simple question.</p>\n<p>(He knew the soulbond was real, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to accept it \u2013 or admit it.)</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d he tried again, unable to hold his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Avatar looked between them as they argued. \u201cSokka, shouldn\u2019t we-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust him Aang.\u201d And those words were damning, mostly because they were true. \u201cI know he\u2019s our soulmate but he\u2019s hurt us too many times-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe saved my life last night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he had a perfectly evil explanation for that.\u201d Sokka turned back to him. \u201cWhy did you help Aang?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko scowled and said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s banished.\u201d</p>\n<p>The three of them turned to look at Katara, who watched Zuko with a mystifying calm, even as she rubbed at her eyes.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cShut up!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t return to the Fire Nation unless he captures Aang.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka nodded. \u201cSo he was keeping him on the market.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that it?\u201d Aang sat down in front of Zuko. \u201cIs that why you helped me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko looked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you have done if I hadn\u2019t found out it was you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko grit his teeth, fully turning his head away. Aang scooted a little closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promised we\u2019d try to join blood after,\u201d he pressed. \u201cWould you have used our bond to trick me into going with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201d Zuko started, unsure of where he was going, \u201cI would have\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang sat closer. He stared.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2018s voice dropped lower. \u201cI have a mission to complete.\u201d Aang\u2019s face fell. \u201cI won\u2019t betray my country.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even for your soulmates?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hissed, rearing up as high as he was capable. He spat sparks. \u201cYou are <em>not</em> my soulmate!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang jumped away from a rush of fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Sokka clapped his hands together. \u201cZuko is still evil. Glad we\u2019ve figured that out.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabbed Aang and shoved him into Appa\u2019s saddle.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka\u2026\u201d Katara looked reluctant, but could barely muster an argument. \u201cThis\u2026 this has to be a shock to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka shooed her into the saddle and she didn\u2019t fight him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe made his choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko flopped back to the ground again and closed his eyes. Best to make this easiest on whichever one of them would come over to untie him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he might change it.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes snapped open again. Katara was still watching him, that same sad expression on her face.</p>\n<p>Maybe she <em>hadn\u2019t</em> been crying because she was stuck with a terrible soulmate. He couldn\u2019t guess why else she would be that upset though. He was certain Sokka would delight in seeing all the times he\u2019d been hurt over the years.</p>\n<p>Sokka leapt onto Appa, settling on the bison\u2019s head with a hold of the reigns.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wait a minute-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me like this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure we can,\u201d Sokka smirked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sure some of your men will find you\u2026 eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko struggled with his bonds again, as if the hundred times he\u2019d tried before weren\u2019t proof that he wasn\u2019t getting out without help.</p>\n<p>He threw out a desperate plea, \u201cIf Zhao\u2019s men find me like this they\u2019ll know what I did and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Prince,\u201d Sokka shrugged, unconcerned by Zuko\u2019s tone. \u201cI\u2019m sure if anyone can get away with a little treason, it\u2019ll be you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t understand-\u201d the world went dark, his vision reduced to a pinprick. He was too hot and too cold and too still. Burnt flesh seared his nostrils.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t breathe. There wouldn\u2019t be much of him left to go back to his father at this rate. Maybe it would be easier that way.</p>\n<p>A cool, <em>familiar</em> hand stroked the skin on his neck and he arched into the soothing touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust breathe slow, okay?\u201d came a gentle voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, just take in a deep breath\u2026\u201d after a few tries he managed it, \u201cAnd hold it for a few seconds\u2026 and now let it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice told him to breathe again, and he found it easier that time.</p>\n<p>The hand constantly touched him, grounding him, as he was untied and manoeuvred upright. He was kneeling, hands clasped with someone else\u2019s; cold in a way he recognised as <em>safe</em> but couldn\u2019t place.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, Zuko.\u201d</p>\n<p>He took in air and the world came together again in syrupy fragments. He realised too late that he was holding hands with Katara.</p>\n<p>He scrambled back, finding all his limbs to be his own, if a little wobbly. Red marks ringed his wrists; a few layers of skin were missing. His breath came a little too quickly, but that was far better than not at all.</p>\n<p>Katara hadn\u2019t moved, still knelt on the ground. Vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feeling better now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko couldn\u2019t meet her eye. He hadn\u2019t had an episode like that in\u2026 it must have been over a year.</p>\n<p>(And he knew who had helped him through them in the past.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d His throat was rough from abuse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to go now,\u201d she said, slow and soft like he was an injured animal, and he nodded, disgustingly appreciative of her gentle tone, \u201cBut you can come with us, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shuddered. His scar prickled with phantom pain. \u201cThat\u2019s treason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, and he thought she really might. \u201cBut can you think about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He would, but he couldn\u2019t admit to that. \u201cPromise me one thing,\u201d he said instead.</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell them about what you saw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust. Just not the worst parts.\u201d Some flare of anger spiked in the back of his mind, hardening his next words, \u201cThe things you saw were private in the first place, and you forced your way in anyway. The least you can do is keep from <em>gossiping</em> about my scar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 I\u2019ll keep it a secret. But please, just think about it, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t think about the Avatar and his friends all the time anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a promise, but it was the best he could offer her.</p>\n<p>She dared to shuffle closer and take his hand. She squeezed it once, quick but not clinical. No one could prove it if he squeezed back, just a little.</p>\n<p>She stood and walked towards the bison and a thought struck him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour necklace!\u201d He stood, bracing himself against the rush of pins and needles. Nothing was quite working right, it seemed.</p>\n<p>She turned, that strange sadness turning into warmth. He wasn\u2019t sure which expression he hated more.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(Anger - that had to be the hot feeling that swelled behind his eyes.)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise.\u201d He felt himself flush, and couldn\u2019t look her in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll get it back to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled, uncaring of his awkward fumblings, and gave him a nod. He returned the expression, turning a nod into a slight bow. (If she saw it as an apology, he wouldn\u2019t have reason to correct her.)</p>\n<p>She climbed on Appa\u2019s back and waved as they flew away.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t return the gesture.</p>\n<p>Nor did he move until they were less than a dot in the sky.</p>\n<p>It had been almost an hour since they left Prince Too-Good-For-His-Soulmates behind, and Katara still seemed shaky.</p>\n<p>Sokka looked back at her from Appa\u2019s head as often as he thought he could get away with, only to see her moping and staring off into the distance, as if she could still see Zuko. Her soulmate.</p>\n<p>Their soulmate. <em>His</em> soulmate.</p>\n<p>Zuko was an asshole. He\u2019d been hunting them for months, trying to capture Aang and destroy their last hope for peace. He\u2019d burned Kyoshi Island and stolen Katara\u2019s necklace.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d also rescued Aang \u2013 even if he had his own motivations \u2013 and promised to give Katara\u2019s necklace back. It could just be a ruse to get closer to them again, but, as much as Sokka hated to admit it, Zuko had a strong belief in honour. He wouldn\u2019t go back on his word like that.</p>\n<p>As for why he was trying to kidnap Aang\u2026 if Sokka had been kicked out of the Water Tribe, he couldn\u2019t imagine what lengths he\u2019d go to so he could go back home.</p>\n<p><em>Then again</em>, no one would kick him out unless he did something really terrible. Just because Zuko\u2019s punishment kinda sucks doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t deserve it. His dad ran the entire country; it must have been his decision. If even his father thought he deserved it\u2026 well, Sokka couldn\u2019t even think of something he could do to make <em>his</em> father kick him out.</p>\n<p>He looked back over his shoulder. Katara was still moping, but that probably wouldn\u2019t change for a while. He might as well try to get some answers out of her while everything was still fresh.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara,\u201d he called, and was gratified when she stopped staring into the abyss as if Zuko would show up out of nowhere. She turned to look at him, and seemed mostly okay. \u201cDid you see anything useful in Zuko\u2019s memories?\u201d</p>\n<p>She glared at him. \u201cHe deserves his privacy, Sokka.\u201d</p>\n<p>He held up his hands defensively. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wants us to give him a chance. <em>Come on</em> - sell him to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko returned to his ship just as the sun came up. Uncle was waiting for him on deck.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been out all night and also for three months or so, and his headache had come back the second he returned to his body. The attack he\u2019d had afterwards hadn\u2019t helped him much either, especially since it had been so long he\u2019d rather thought he was done with them. He was completely shattered, physically and mentally, but, most of all, emotionally.</p>\n<p>But he knew he\u2019d never be able to sleep unless he figured something out.</p>\n<p>Uncle would know what to do \u2013 he\u2019d have suggestions of how to use their bond to capture the Avatar if he thought it was the best course of action, or advice on what to do if he decided to\u2026 not do that. And, of course, he would never tell his father that Zuko was soulmates with the Avatar.</p>\n<p>Just having the bond was treasonous \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter that he hadn\u2019t wanted it in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Zuko, where have you been?\u201d Uncle called in his pretending-he-hadn\u2019t-been-worried tone. \u201cYou missed music night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>At least something good came out of this mess.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to speak with you, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stood, but retained the faux-jovial tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko gestured for his Uncle to follow him, and led him to his room.</p>\n<p>He locked the door after checking the corridor was empty.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Uncle said, \u201cThat someone rescued the Avatar from Zhao last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko wondered if it was treason to call it a \u2018rescue\u2019 instead of a \u2018theft\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Zuko knew to his bones that uncle would never do anything to betray him, but needed to hear it in words, \u201cWhat I am about to say is to stay between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never to anything to cause you harm, nephew, you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI give you my word that everything you say will stay between us. On my honour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko let out a little sigh at hearing what he already knew to be true. Then: \u201cThe Avatar and his friends are my soulmates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle blinked, a complex expression passing across his face too quickly for Zuko to interpret before it was smoothed over. \u201cI see. You are certain of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey each have a mark that matches my broadswords. Katara touched blood with me and\u2026 it worked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something he\u2019d never shared with anyone, even with his soulmates when they visited before all this started, was that he had never trusted that the soulbond would work. His marks were burned off mere minutes after he was born \u2013 and it was well known that a baby\u2019s marks were only formed during their birth. (Stillborns, for example, never had any marks at all; and babies born early were sometimes said to have their marks appear a few seconds after they came out.)</p>\n<p>The marks were as new as him when he was born, and the soul connection could have still been creating itself. And he\u2019d never heard of anyone else losing their soulmarks.</p>\n<p>(It seemed barbaric, in hindsight, to keep someone from the people fate had bound them to.</p>\n<p>He was pretty sure that thought was treason.)</p>\n<p>He\u2019d long since resigned himself to the possibility that he would never touch blood and have it work perfectly, and the fact that everything had gone so smoothly that day was\u2026 to be honest, he wasn\u2019t sure what to think about it.</p>\n<p>He liked to think it was a good thing that he could still have soulmates, even though he would have preferred for them to be <em>literally anyone else</em>.</p>\n<p>Uncle nodded, his expression giving away none of his inner thoughts. \u201cAnd how do you feel about this development, Prince Zuko?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko froze. \u201cHow <em>should</em> I feel about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko was unconvinced. He knew he could trust Uncle, but he didn\u2019t like how he chose not to take any side. Maybe he was trying to avoid nudging Zuko into a direction he wouldn\u2019t have otherwise gone in \u2013 trying to make sure this was Zuko\u2019s decision and no one else\u2019s \u2013 but he had come to him for advice, not this\u2026 introspection.</p>\n<p>(If he made the wrong decision, all the fault would lay with him. And it wasn\u2019t as though he wanted to think about the things he\u2019d done, the people he was stuck with, all that he\u2019d have to do if he wanted to make it up to them\u2026</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t like that he was thinking about trying to fix things with them either, but something inside him balked at the image of the Avatar in chains.</p>\n<p>The Fire Nation would have no reason to keep Sokka and Katara alive. He didn\u2019t like that notion either.)</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Uncle said, \u201cHas the right to tell you how you should feel \u2013 especially when it comes to your soulmates. If you want to be with them, then you should; and if you don\u2019t, then nothing needs to change.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded as if that was helpful.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Nephew,\u201d Uncle said again, \u201chow do you feel about this development?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara\u2019s mother was killed by the Fire Nation,\u201d he found himself saying. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, wasn\u2019t even a fighter, but they killed her. Katara is the last waterbender in the entirety of the South Pole. And their village\u2026 I hadn\u2019t realised, but that\u2019s basically all that\u2019s standing between the Southern Water tribe and extinction. Just a handful of outposts like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle nodded. \u201cIt is a shame that that has happened.\u201d His tone and expression remained neutral, but there was something encouraging in his nod, so Zuko continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right. We\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t have done that. The Fire Nation is supposed to be sharing our greatness, but instead,\u201d he took a deep breath, unable to look his Uncle in the eye. He might have been making a huge mistake. \u201cThe war isn\u2019t what we think it is, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka really was infuriating sometimes. Mostly when he was right.</p>\n<p>Katara nodded at his suggestion \u2013 it would be best to give him some impression of Zuko, aside from what they already knew of him \u2013 and paused to think. It would be best not to talk about anything too traumatic; Zuko had specifically asked her <em>not</em> to do that and she felt that she\u2019d cried enough that day, besides.</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t want her to talk about anything embarrassing either, but, from what she\u2019d seen of his childhood, his past was made up almost entirely of trauma and adorableness. She didn\u2019t have many other options. He\u2019d forgive her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so. You know his intimidating faces and monologuing shtick, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka nodded, his eyebrows scrunched in confusion. That probably wasn\u2019t the <em>best</em> opener when she was trying to convince Sokka that Zuko wasn\u2019t evil, but\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally rehearsed,\u201d she said, watching Sokka freeze. She grinned, \u201cZuko\u2019s a little nerd. He doesn\u2019t even come up with half of it, he just loves theatre.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka expression of pure glee was something Katara would treasure more than she would ever admit. \u201cSo what\u2019s he like when he\u2019s not pretending?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so awkward. He pretends he\u2019s being angry but really he just doesn\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t take him seriously anymore. He\u2019s like a little turtleduck \u2013 he loves them by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurtleducks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen he was little he would sneak them into his room and make nest for them \u2013 and he was such a cute kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka frowned. Katara couldn\u2019t blame him; until she\u2019d seen baby Zuko herself she couldn\u2019t have pictured it either. The way he acted, it was like he\u2019d blasted his way out of the womb, screaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe grew up though,\u201d Sokka said, unconvinced. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara hesitated. \u201cHe asked me not to talk about <em>that</em>, specifically, but\u2026\u201d she paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay so think about it this way,\u201d she said. \u201cZuko was raised by the worst person on earth, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang and Sokka nodded immediately. No trace of argument there.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Ozai would approve of Zuko doing anything that we would approve of?\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Iroh watched his nephew list to the side, almost falling asleep sitting upright, only to correct himself with a scowl. This had happened seven times, now.</p>\n<p>Iroh got up to retrieve and brew some chamomile and lavender tea, sitting down at his nephew\u2019s side as it stewed. Zuko instantly leaned into him, the smell of the tea enough to make him drowsy.</p>\n<p>Well, drowsi<em>er</em>.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before his nephew finally dropped off to sleep. Since they were already in his chambers, it was easy enough for Iroh to settle him in his bed. Zuko, normally an extraordinarily light sleeper, didn\u2019t react once throughout the process.</p>\n<p>Iroh knew it would be best to leave him for the moment and organise the ship\u2019s departure. Regardless of what Zuko\u2019s chose, he would want to be following the Avatar.</p>\n<p>Instead, he knelt beside his bed, watching the rare calm across his nephew\u2019s face, and ran a gentle hand over where his hair should have been.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s soulmates were the Avatar and his friends. It was likely that he was destined to be the Avatar\u2019s firebending teacher.</p>\n<p>If anyone were to find out, Zuko would be executed. Some part of Iroh couldn\u2019t help but be grateful that there was no evidence of their bond on Zuko\u2019s body, even as he shuddered to remember why.</p>\n<p>(He remembered all too well the struggle he went to to keep Lu Ten\u2019s soulmarks hidden from his father and brother. He knew that Ozai would have never even <em>considered</em> protecting his son\u2019s soulbonds.)</p>\n<p>Iroh tried to be optimistic about the situation; it now seemed quite likely that Zuko would join the Avatar of his own accord, especially considering the way he\u2019d been speaking. It was the first time Zuko had said anything treasonous on purpose, it seemed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps his adventure the previous night had broken the seal on treason.</p>\n<p>Zuko was normally a stubborn and decisive boy, but his worldview had changed drastically since he last saw him, and he was, for once, unsure as to what the right thing to do was. Iroh knew that whatever he suggested, be it to join the Avatar or to fight him, would be the only thing that could sway him to either side.</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have been hesitating. It was the right thing to do \u2013 encouraging his nephew to seek out the people who would, given a little more time, love him as much as Iroh himself did; not to mention that the Avatar needed all the help he could get, and that Zuko would be an invaluable addition to his team.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s scar was huge and angry and likely still painful; it was the only reason Zuko was hesitating. He knew the consequences for displeasing his father all too well. He needed to be sure before he committed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Aang would be the first to admit that he didn\u2019t quite grasp the bond that came from shared blood, having never known himself to share blood with anybody. Despite that, he knew - mostly from watching Sokka and Katara, who, despite their widely differing personalities and many arguments, cared for each other deeply - that family, to those who had it, would always be incredibly important. As much as soulmates, even, as mad as that seemed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOzai wouldn\u2019t hurt Zuko though?\u201d Aang asked, looking between his friends. \u201cHe\u2019s his son. That\u2019s important, isn\u2019t it? Zuko should be able to do as much treason as he wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara flinched at his question, and very deliberately turned her head away.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara?\u201d Sokka asked, attention firmly fixed on her.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p>Aang had a very bad thought. \u201cKatara, do you know how Zuko got his scar?\u201d</p>\n<p>She swallowed. \u201cHe asked me not to talk about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKat-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me about that,\u201d she said, sharper than she needed to. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said he might change his mind,\u201d Sokka said, out of nowhere. \u201cAbout coming with us. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara gave Sokka a small smile, looking at him and not seeing Aang\u2019s pleading expression. \u201cWe just turned his life on its head, Sokka. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if you found out you\u2019d been fighting your soulmates. He just needs some time to figure things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka raised one sceptical eyebrow. \u201cHow sure are you about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good person at heart,\u201d Katara insisted. \u201cBut he knows the price of treason, and he knows the Firelord wouldn\u2019t be lenient with him. His whole crew would be in danger if he switched sides \u2013 his Uncle especially.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang blinked. \u201cThe old man who follows him around all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara grinned at him. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty awesome. I\u2019m hoping that Zuko will talk to him about this instead of just freaking out about it in private. Uncle cares <em>way</em> more about Zuko than he does about the Fire Nation, so if anyone\u2019s gonna encourage some treason it\u2019ll be him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang nodded. That fit with what he\u2019d been told about blood family a lot better than everything with Zuko\u2019s father. Maybe Zuko should just make his Uncle his dad. Is that allowed?</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d Sokka said, \u201cOn what he values most-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>Zuko</em>,\u201d Katara huffed, \u201cI just told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but his happiness or his safety?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara paused. \u201cIf he thinks we have a chance at winning the war\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They exchanged a look that Aang pretended not to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone has to be the sceptic here,\u201d Sokka said eventually, \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m willing to wait and see with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Aang shouted. \u201cSoulmate Zuko! And he can be my firebending teacher, too!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka nodded, something going on behind his eyes. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t deny that having a Fire Prince on our side could be <em>very</em> useful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang bounced in his seat. Knowing Zuko, it wouldn\u2019t be long before he showed up again. It was strange to be looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>Katara found it morbidly appropriate when Zuko\u2019s mark started flickering during her healing lesson.</p>\n<p>Okay, fine, that was a lie - Sokka called it morbidly appropriate when she saw him later on. The only thing Katara had felt at the time was frustration and panic. This was the first she had heard from Zuko after he rescued Aang, and it was because he was dying.</p>\n<p>(When she got to know him even better, this type of thing became the norm. Despite her objections.)</p>\n<p>She\u2019d seen enough of Zuko\u2019s stubborn determination to survive that she wasn\u2019t too worried that he would actually die, but was concerned about what this meant for his general health. He\u2019d probably have a new scar or two the next time she saw him.</p>\n<p>But he would be fine. If there was one thing about Zuko she could trust, it was that he would always turn up at the most inconvenient time. He would be fine.</p>\n<p>Her wrist throbbed.</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t remember much about her lesson after it finished.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko stood on the sand and watched his ship burn. She was useless - a tiny, ugly thing made mostly of rust rather than real steel - but she had served him and his crew to the best of her abilities for almost three years. She had been his home.</p>\n<p>He was lucky that he\u2019d already been preparing for his trip to the North Pole and so had managed to save most of what he\u2019d need in the next few days. He\u2019d begun preparations as soon as Zhao had stolen his crew and he\u2019d realised that he\u2019d have to steal aboard one of his ships if he wanted to reach the North Pole.</p>\n<p>Which he most certainly did. Zhao was up to something worse than usual, and the North Pole would be where all the action was. Regardless of what he chose to do about his soulmates \u2013 and he <em>was</em> still questioning it, no matter what the swords and mask at his hip<em> (what the necklace tied firmly to his wrist)</em> suggested about his intentions \u2013 he would have to be where they were.</p>\n<p>Uncle stepped up beside him, standing a little closer than Zuko would normally have permitted. Uncle had thought him dead for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Zuko <em>had</em> almost died. His hands trembled with leftover adrenaline. He shifted just a little closer to Uncle in case he wanted to hug him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you declare otherwise,\u201d Uncle said, steadfastly not hugging him. (It wasn\u2019t like Zuko could outright give permission; Uncle would get the wrong idea.) \u201cThe Fire Nation will believe you dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fire Nation \u2013 his father \u2013 would have no reason to target <em>him</em> specifically, if he chose his soulmates; they would only know this mysterious Blue Spirit figure. If he chose treason and didn\u2019t enjoy it, it would be simple enough to disappear somewhere in the Earth Kingdom. No one would even know to look for him.</p>\n<p>This would be his best opportunity if he wanted to switch sides.</p>\n<p>His scar prickled, irritated by the heat of the explosion. He inched just a little closer to Uncle, who wrapped a careful (grounding) hand around his waist. \u00a0</p>\n<p>His ribs ached, and he reassured himself by pressing on the wound. The remainders of his marks weren\u2019t the cause of the aches.</p>\n<p><em>They weren\u2019t hurt</em>, he promised himself amid the pain, <em>I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s hurt. No matter what I choose to do, I\u2019ll protect them.</em></p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know why he kept pretending to himself.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The siege had started and Zuko was flickering again. Katara anxiously kept watch over the mark as Aang struggled to fall into a meditative state.</p>\n<p>It seemed silly, even selfish, to be worrying about the Prince of the Fire Nation at a time like this, but she <em>knew</em> him now. He might not have been her ally, not yet, but she liked to think he was her friend. \u00a0</p>\n<p>She was certain Aang thought the same; even though he hadn\u2019t seen Zuko\u2019s memories like she had \u00a0(and <em>dear sweet Tui</em> it would tear him in two if he saw them) he spoke fondly of how they had fought together.</p>\n<p><em>We were a good team</em>, he\u2019d told them over and over. Even when they met Jeong Jeong he\u2019d refused to consider having anyone else as his firebending teacher.</p>\n<p>Katara had encouraged him, if only to see the frustration on Sokka\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>(He was gonna feel like such an asshole when he saw.)</p>\n<p>Katara let herself relax a little as Aang began to glow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Yue asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s crossing into the Spirit World,\u201d Katara explained. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine so long as we don\u2019t move his body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should get some help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s my friend \u2013 my soulmate, actually,\u201d Yue\u2019s eyes widened a little. Apparently Sokka had neglected to mention that during their talks together.</p>\n<p>(Then again, soulmates had been a sore spot for him lately. No one wanted to say it, but Sokka \u2013 the \u2018rational\u2019 member of the group - seemed almost hurt that Zuko had rejected them, despite there being multiple reasons for him to do so.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more than capable of taking care of him,\u201d Katara finished. It had been a struggle to get herself the waterbending lessons she\u2019d wanted, but, through a combination of showing up to watch the lessons uninvited and repeatedly challenging Pakku to fights so she could get her practice in, she\u2019d worn Pakku down enough that he just ignored her when she showed up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier with help though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A voice cut across the oasis. A masked figure, clothed in white with a familiar set of swords swinging at his hip, strode towards them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(How did he even get in here?)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katara rushed forwards to hug him, but hesitated when she got a closer look at him.</p>\n<p>She immediately noticed his odd way of moving \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a limp, nor did he appear to favour any injury, but he definitely wasn\u2019t at a hundred percent. She had suspected he was injured earlier, considering how his marks had been flickering recently, but had unconsciously dismissed the notion when she realised he was coming to join them, assuming he wouldn\u2019t be throwing himself into a dangerous situation while injured.</p>\n<p>She realised what a stupid thought that was the second she stopped to think about it. Uncle was the only person who cared enough to keep him out of trouble, but Zuko wouldn\u2019t listen to him, especially when it came to his own safety.</p>\n<p>She was going to heal him, then smack him, then heal <em>that</em> and then lock him in a block of ice so he wouldn\u2019t get hurt again.</p>\n<p>The idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured,\u201d she told him, unsure if he actually cared enough to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>He waved her concerns away with a gesture, but elected to sit on a rock when he reached them. Katara was going to be generous and call that a concession.</p>\n<p>She wreathed her hands in water and sat down in front of him. He tilted his head in confusion, expression still hidden behind his mask.</p>\n<p>As if she didn\u2019t know it was him somehow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you take that thing off?\u201d</p>\n<p>He glanced towards Yue and Katara felt her eye twitching. Would dealing with Zuko always be immediately infuriating?</p>\n<p>\u201cYue can keep a secret.\u201d Katara scowled. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko didn't take it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"If it's your identity that concerns you,\" Yue said, \"Then I give my word not to reveal it.\"</p>\n<p>He paused in thought for an insulting amount of time, then pulled it off and \u2013 yep, that was a black eye.</p>\n<p>Katara raised her water-wrapped hands to his face unthinkingly and Zuko \u2013 <em>of course</em> \u2013 flinched, falling off his perch to land flat on his back.</p>\n<p>She pulled back, dropping her water, and lowering her hands into a non-threatening posture.</p>\n<p>She gave him a moment to gather himself, then: \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked up at her. He hadn't moved from where he'd landed, but otherwise seemed okay enough. She continued, keeping her voice low and soothing, \u201cI can heal you, if you want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at the spilt water at her feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I was going to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sat up but stayed on the ground. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>She offered him a hand up. \u201cWill you let me heal you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stared at her hand. \u201c...Could you just do my ribs?\u201d</p>\n<p>That bruise looked painful. It was a shame it was directly over his eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d she promised.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He accepted her hand and sat back on the rock. He didn't let go, after, nor did he stop staring at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pushing down frustration at his immediate look of confusion. \u201cAbout that, again, but also\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have forced you, last time I saw you. I had no right to that and I just wasn\u2019t thinking and that\u2019s no excuse, but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Katara.\u201d He squeezed her hand gently. \u201cIt \u2013 it wasn\u2019t <em>right</em> of you to force me to soulbond, but it was necessary. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it otherwise, and the things I saw\u2026 nothing matched what I\u2019d been told about the war. I needed to see it \u2013 and I <em>needed</em> the proof that we were soulmates.\u201d</p>\n<p>He let go of her hand and turned his head away, ending the conversation. He then pulled up his tunic, watching her wrap her hand in glowing water with a twitch of her fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found a Master,\u201d he commented, while she tried not to stare at the pale pink skin on his stomach where his soulmarks used to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. Mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p>He cocked his head as she placed her hands over his ribs. She opened her mouth to explain, but then-</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAre these broken?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCracked,\u201d he corrected, as if the distinction mattered when he was throwing himself into a fight with <em>broken ribs</em>. \u201cAt worst. They might just be bruised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re cracked. They\u2019re <em>my</em> ribs,\u201d he sounded almost indignant, \u201cI\u2019d know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> the healer here-\u201d and if she hadn\u2019t almost sent him into another panic a minute ago she\u2019d have smacked him for that comment, \u201c-and <em>I </em>say they\u2019re broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve fought with worse before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know I could heal,\u201d she moaned, dropping her water to bury her head in her hands. \u201cWere you planning to fight with broken ribs?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it before,\u201d Zuko repeated. Then, just to be an asshole, he added, \u201cI was more worried about the probable concussion, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stared up at him. \u201cYou are just the worst person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am well aware of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to take better care of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to stop imitating Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is just what caring sounds like, Zuko,\u201d she glowered. \u201cNow let me see your concussion or you\u2019re not allowed to fight in anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you bench me I\u2019ll kidnap Aang again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say \u2018again\u2019 as if you ever actually succeeded,\" she scoffed, waggling a finger at him. \"He\u2019s kidnapped you more often than you\u2019ve kidnapped him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI captured him the day we met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe turned himself in and escaped half an hour later. We <em>let you go</em> at least six hours after he caught you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not how I remember it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the concussion. Are you going to let me check on it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko grumbled but didn\u2019t actually protest, and Katara took at it the agreement that it was.</p>\n<p>\u2026it was definitely a concussion.</p>\n<p>Katara gritted her teeth and resisted the counterproductive urge to smack him upside the head.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It was so weird having a friend.</p>\n<p>Zuko was soothed by his soulmates\u2019 mere presence, and there was something pleasant about the way she fussed over his injuries.</p>\n<p>Katara stuck her tongue between her teeth in concentration as she numbed his headache and whisked the fog from his thoughts. Aang gave out a gentle glow where he meditated on the ground, his lemur curled in his lap.</p>\n<p>Zuko couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d ever thought he could value his own self-preservation over the happiness of his soulmates. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d ever done anything to hurt them.</p>\n<p>He was going to make it right.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The siege had started and Zuko was flickering again. Sokka took that as a sign that he was in the North Pole somehow.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d meant what he\u2019d said when he\u2019d promised Katara and Aang that he would give Zuko a chance, but unless the guy came in with an apology and a promise to work with them from here on out, offered completely upfront without prompting, Sokka was unlikely to give him any more chances.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t feeling particularly charitable at the moment either, dealing with Hahn and getting kicked off the mission would do that to a guy, and watching the destruction of the last real stronghold of his people wasn\u2019t all that great for his mood either.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t all that sure how to feel when he found Katara healing Zuko in the middle of the secret spirit oasis not two feet away from Princess Yue the beautiful and elegant and not-even-<em>slightly</em>-a-warrior.</p>\n<p>He hoped Katara had made Zuko swear himself to their side before she made him less vulnerable.</p>\n<p>(<em>Hoped</em> has a very different meaning to <em>believed</em>.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you even <em>get</em> here?\u201d he asked, walking towards them at an <em>un</em>hurried pace - <em>no</em>, he was <em>not</em> panicking - instead of voicing all of his other concerns. His low-level hostility was perfectly appropriate, and Katara had no right to be making <em>that</em> face when she was <em>healing their mortal enemy</em>.</p>\n<p>It was so hard, sometimes, being the only member of Team Avatar that actually wanted to live.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurtle-seal tunnels,\u201d Zuko said, as if that made sense.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s step faltered for a moment. \u201cYou<em> swam</em>? You, a <em>firebender</em>, swam in the arctic ocean long enough to reach the city centre?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a concussion,\u201d Katara added.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd broken ribs,\u201d Yue said.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Cracked</em> ribs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara buried her head in her hands. The gesture seemed well practised.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara, I know what broken ribs feel like and this isn\u2019t that.\u201d</p>\n<p>And <em>Zuko the Determined Crazy Persistence Predator </em>suddenly became <em>Zuko the Self-Destructive Idiot</em>. It should have been reassuring, but somehow wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>(Sokka was destined to forever remain the only member of Team Avatar that actually wanted to live.)</p>\n<p>Sokka sat down with the group, keeping a casual hold on his boomerang that felt irritatingly unnecessary when Zuko was so bruised.</p>\n<p>At least he knew why his mark was flickering before.</p>\n<p>Zuko didn\u2019t even seem to realise that what he\u2019d done was a big deal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you not dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko gave him a slow blink. Was that a bruise under his eye or was he just <em>that</em> tired?</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>am</em> dead, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>What?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katara flinched.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr, rather, Prince Zuko is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka raised an eyebrow when he didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cI think you\u2019ll need to explain it better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko gave a slow smirk and sat back a little and <em>Tui and La he\u2019s rehearsed this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Zuko, Agni bless his soul, was <em>tragically</em> slain by pirates, who blew up his ship with him on it. The explosion was so huge, so disastrous, that Zuko's body was destroyed beyond all chance of finding him. By the Grace of Agni, his crew had all left to join the invasion, and his Uncle wasn\u2019t on the ship at the time, making Zuko the only casualty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara was completely right: Zuko was a little nerd. How did he manage to make something as metal as <em>faking your death</em> seem dorky?</p>\n<p>Katara frowned next to him. \u201cUncle knows you\u2019re alive, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko scrunched up his nose, affronted. \u201cOf course Uncle knows. Even if I hadn\u2019t needed his help breaking into one of Zhao\u2019s ships, I could never have done that to him-\u201d Katara nodded, and Sokka got the impression that he was missing something, \u201c- and the few seconds when he thought I was dead was just painful to listen to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara threw her hands up, clearly wanting to slap him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t <em>tell him </em>before you did it? What if something went wrong and he was on the boat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was <em>expecting</em> someone to try to kill me \u2013 well, more than usual, at least\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>So it was less of a faked-death and more of him capitalising on people trying to kill him. Zuko didn\u2019t seem to think the distinction was important \u2013 no, he didn\u2019t think the distinction needed to be made; it was <em>obvious</em> that people were trying to kill him. The alternate explanation involved him <em>thinking ahead </em>and<em> making plans </em>and<em> being clever</em> and Zuko didn\u2019t know how to do any of those things. It made much more sense that he'd just pissed someone off.</p>\n<p>Sokka resisted the urge to stick his head in the pond and <em>scream</em>, instead just sharing a commiserating look with Katara.</p>\n<p>Sokka made the executive decision to not hear more about Zuko almost dying and ask the important question, \u201cYou<em> are</em> on our side here, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Blue Spirit is on your side, as he has proven to be before.\u201d That <em>almost </em>counted as an answer, but became less useful when one remembered that the Blue Spirit was in no way real, nor was he connected to Zuko. \u201cZuko, of course, is dead, and so has nothing to do with anything that happens from here on out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sighed. \u201cI respect the bit that you\u2019re doing right now, but I really need a more concrete answer here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d and pulled a knife out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>Sokka flinched back. (<em>Why would a firebender even </em>need<em> a knife in the first place?</em>) \u201cWhat are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko cut off his stupid ponytail.</p>\n<p>Katara gasped, hands covering her mouth.</p>\n<p>Yue looked just as baffled as him, though that was fair considering she didn\u2019t even know who Zuko <em>was</em>.</p>\n<p>Katara leapt up and threw her arms around Zuko, pulling him into a hug that he clearly didn\u2019t know what to do with, not letting go even when he started to flail a little, the few patches of unmarred skin on his face bright red.</p>\n<p>He eventually pushed her off and she sat back in her seat, eyes bright and shining.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get the feeling,\u201d Sokka said, pushing down hopeful suspicions, \u201cThat I\u2019m missing something here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sliced open the edge of his palm, then flipped the knife and offered the handle to Sokka. \u201cDo you want the explanation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka remembered how Katara had cried most of the day after she watched his life, tears coming in starts and stops whenever she was left alone with her thoughts for too long. None of them had managed to sleep through the night, listening to her nightmares over and over again.</p>\n<p>Sokka would need all his wits about him for the siege.</p>\n<p>But this was an olive branch and Zuko had always been a curiosity and he almost seemed to be <em>smiling</em> at him. It suited him.</p>\n<p>Sokka took the knife, made his own cut over the scar from the last two he\u2019d done, and took Zuko\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Zuko was <em>tiny!</em> He was small and round and constantly asking questions and running into walls in his excitement. He was a little boy.</p>\n<p>Katara hadn\u2019t mentioned how tiny he was as a baby - but, then again, <em>everyone</em> was that tiny as a baby. She must have thought it was obvious - and really it was \u2013 but he hadn\u2019t been prepared for this bright-eyed grubby handed version of his mortal enemy/destiny-recommended friend.</p>\n<p>He was, in the first memory Sokka was shown, pacing his room reciting something from a scroll on his bed. He was exactly as dramatic as he always had been, and Sokka didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d never realised that all his dramatics and monologues and intimidating faces were all smoke and mirrors.</p>\n<p>Tiny Zuko played games with his mother and chatted with the palace guards and pspsps-ed at the local owlcats. He tripped as he ran through hallways, and Sokka rubbed his shoulder as he sniffed over grazed knees.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka learned a lot about the Fire Nation via Zuko. During his fifth vision he learned about the significance of their topknots, and what it had meant that Zuko had cut his. It took twelve visions (of a gap-toothed Zuko smiling at pretty flowers his mother grew and asking for hugs when he fell over) before a five-year-old Zuko was considered old enough to begin his training, and Sokka saw the best and worst parts of the Fire Nation.</p>\n<p>The soldiers that trained in the barracks were just\u2026 people. They cooed over baby Zuko when no one was watching, and helped him with his sword stances. Even the benders were gentle with him, wrapping him in encouragements and keeping quiet about the dangers of being non-bending nobility.</p>\n<p>Sokka was surprised to learn that Zuko had been a late bloomer. This little fact showed Sokka the worst parts of the Fire Nation.</p>\n<p>Well, the worst part. Singular.</p>\n<p>It was Ozai.</p>\n<p>And Sokka was going to kill him one day.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYour sister mastered those forms six months ago, Prince Zuko.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>His sister liked to push Zuko into the pond and delay him on his way to training.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYour tutors have been ordered to use whatever means they find necessary to made this knowledge stick in your empty head.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes Sokka found fingertip bruises around his pale wrists. He could only hope that someone has been there when they first appeared.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cPrince Zuko, I strongly suggest you find whatever traces of Fire exist within you before the end of the month. Your existence as it is disgraces me, disgraces our Nation, and I can\u2019t imagine what use I would have for a non-bending heir.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sokka knew it was his duty, as soulmate, to comfort Zuko through these times. He also knew that he\u2019d never be able to grab Ozai by his stupid goat beard and give him the pummelling he deserved in his ghostly form. This did not mean it was not difficult for him to restrain himself from throwing hands every time he saw Ozai.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka wondered how many people could get away with branding a Prince, wondered how likely it was that some assassin or kidnapper had managed it, considering how well Zuko fought. The edges of his scar were almost neat, and the wound itself was deep, as though he had been still when it had happened.</p>\n<p>Sokka had seen Zuko in action. He was quick as a blink and constantly on guard.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a fight.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka was man enough to admit that he\u2019d become fond of Zuko the second he started acting like a dramatic little nerd in the Spirit Oasis. He couldn\u2019t help it; everything he thought he knew about the guy was completely unravelled by this absolute <em>dork.</em> It only got better when he watched Zuko reading out his scrolls, and nothing could have prepared him for the joy of going to the theatre with him.</p>\n<p>Together, they ripped into the sacrilege that was The Ember Island Players\u2019 rendition of \u2018Love Amongst the Dragons\u2019. Sokka expressed his disgust by squeezing Zuko\u2019s arm, his laughter with an arm around his shoulders. (Zuko needed more casual touch in his life, and Sokka was more than willing to supply that.) Zuko\u2019s face was a sight to behold on those nights, and it was always fun when he corrected the actors getting their lines wrong.</p>\n<p>Sokka thought back to Zuko\u2019s missing ponytail in the real world, to his steady hand as he offered him the knife. The calm and sureness in his expression as he offered Sokka his soul.</p>\n<p>His tiny baby nerd friend, who looked at him (a little to the left but close enough) with wide eyes and called him \u2018Brother\u2019, had pledged himself to them. He was theirs, and Sokka couldn\u2019t wait to get back to his body and give him a real hug.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A six-year-old Zuko promised his father with a determined pout and shaking knees that he would do better.</p>\n<p>There was nothing but conviction in the week that followed, his days full of failed katas and nights spent staring into candles until he finally managed a few weak sparks.</p>\n<p>His expression of sheer joy was not worth the preceding weeks of fear and exhaustion, but it did soften them.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko had only defected a few days ago \u2013 and that was, as far as Sokka could tell, mostly because of their bond, rather than a genuine belief in their cause or a hatred for his father.</p>\n<p>Did Zuko even know how messed up this was?</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face was starting to look like Zuko\u2019s face. This was a problem. At least, it would be soon enough.</p>\n<p>Their was a cold pit of dread in his stomach every time he looked at Zuko, every time he was brought to a new incident in his childhood, and he wondered if this would be the last time he\u2019d look like <em>that</em>, all round faced and happy-ish and with all his face where it was meant to be. He only scowled when he chose to, a luxury the Zuko he knew was not afforded .</p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t Katara have told him what to look out for? At least then his visits with his baby nerd brother wouldn\u2019t have been marred with \u2018what-if\u2019s.</p>\n<p>(It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know exactly why Katara hadn\u2019t told him \u2013 Zuko\u2019s scar was his business until he decided otherwise, and if he\u2019d wanted Sokka to know about his scar ahead of time he\u2019d have said something.</p>\n<p>(It was not only possible but actually quite likely that Zuko simply hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead but he liked to give the guy some credit where he could.))</p>\n<p>He\u2019d though it might have been the incident when he was nine and his father was ordered to kill him.</p>\n<p>(Sokka had tried with all his might to push him out of his ball of panic and force him out the window; a terrible fear that if he didn\u2019t Zuko would actually <em>die</em> guiding his hands. Zuko was alive in their time, but was that only because Sokka had dragged him out of danger? Time travel was tricky business.)</p>\n<p>He\u2019d wondered if the the burn was meant to kill him, and he\u2019d been allowed his life when he survived the infection, but Zuko got out of that incident suspiciously unharmed with his grandfather suspiciously dead and his mother suspiciously missing and Zuko not suspecting there was anything wrong with that <em>for the love of the spirits, Zuko.</em></p>\n<p>Willful ignorance was a powerful thing.</p>\n<p>Time moved on and training got harder. Sokka nudged him into his proper stances when his Sifus refused to demonstrate a second time just so they had an excuse to burn him. Ozai turned an irritated eye on Zuko\u2019s injuries, only making things worse for him the more he struggled to keep up out of some sick belief that he would gain strength through trauma.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he was hoping Zuko would die one of these days, and Ozai would be done with his \u2018weaker\u2019, more compassionate, heir.</p>\n<p>Either way, it didn\u2019t bode well.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Four spirits brushed hands with him when they entered the war meeting. Sokka pulled a deep breath into his non-existent lungs and closed his eyes for a second. Just a second, so he could prepare himself.</p>\n<p>He sat in front of Zuko in the meeting, their knees touching, drinking in his unblemished face.</p>\n<p>In the back of his mind, he wondered if he shouldn\u2019t be paying more attention to the meeting itself. He listened to every other word but he was in a <em>Fire Nation war meeting</em> and instead of dissecting their tactics, the ways they made their decisions; instead of memorising the Generals\u2019 faces for future reference, he was totally-not-crying at Zuko\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>(He wished he could just be angry; at least he\u2019d know what to do with that.)</p>\n<p>Zuko stood with a stomp and yelled about honour and justice and betrayal and looked just like himself in every way that mattered.</p>\n<p>Zuko was ordered to fight in a duel. He set his jaw and squared his shoulders and clenched his hands into fists that might not have been shaking.</p>\n<p>Sokka squeezed his shoulder and hoped it would be quick.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t quick.</p>\n<p>***<strike></strike></p>\n<p>Sokka was so ready to kill the Firelord.</p>\n<p>Zuko was so ready to capture the Avatar so he could go home and meet his soulmates.</p>\n<p>(Sokka was sure his forehead would hurt from all the slapping if he actually had a physical form.)</p>\n<p>Zuko refused to slow down, to take a minute to heal. He raced across the globe, throwing himself headlong into danger chasing the chance of a lead.</p>\n<p>Uncle really was an awesome dude \u2013 he was chill and clever and gentle and Zuko listened to almost half the things he said \u2013 but he should have tied Zuko down and force fed him sweet bean buns and nice words every once in a while.</p>\n<p>It probably wouldn\u2019t have worked, but Sokka would have liked to see it happen.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko found them. He did increasingly stupid things trying to capture them, and he did it so he could meet them.</p>\n<p>Sokka wondered if Zuko had pissed off one spirit too many while hunting down leads, and now the spirit was laughing at them.</p>\n<p>Zuko teamed up with pirates and threw himself into fights and crept aboard one of Zhao\u2019s boats. He swam in arctic waters with broken ribs.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sokka was sitting on a rock in an oasis in the middle of the North Pole. The invasion was still on. He still had to deal with that.</p>\n<p>He was so spirits-damned <em>tired</em>.</p>\n<p>Zuko looked similarly exhausted, unfocused eyes staring at the ground, a slump in his shoulders that he usually tried to keep hidden. He gripped his seat tightly, blood oozing from the cut on his palm.</p>\n<p>His breaths heaved in and out slowly. Like someone with asthma trying to meditate.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was pale as a corpse, his eyes heavy somehow. His ponytail, held in place by remnants of ribbon, sat by his feet like a dead mouse-sparrow.</p>\n<p>Sokka stepped over the ponytail, grabbed Zuko shoulders and pulled him into a hug. He was stiff and unresponsive, confused and concerned in equal parts, eventually moving his arms up and around in an attempt at returning the gesture.</p>\n<p><em>Dear sweet Tui and La</em> the kid didn\u2019t know how to <em>hug.</em></p>\n<p>Katara smugged at Sokka over Zuko\u2019s shoulder and he couldn\u2019t quite find it in himself to be annoyed at her. It may have been one of those rare occasions in which Katara was right.</p>\n<p>Zuko eventually softened in his arms, leaning into his hold and <em>oof</em>, he was heavy. Sokka shifted them so they were sat down again, keeping an arm firmly around Zuko\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Sokka wasn\u2019t sure how much Zuko had slept over the last few days. He\u2019d only really seen snippets of his various ridiculous schemes, often just being brought in to tap a tune on his shoulder in reassurance that he wasn\u2019t about to die \u2013 and Sokka was very annoyed when he realised that that\u2019s what destiny had been having him do \u2013 but he was fairly sure that he\u2019d spent the last few nights hiding on one of Zhao\u2019s ships, recovering from explosions, before he broke in to the North Pole using turtle-seal tunnels and Sokka would have to punch him for that after he healed up because-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know turtle-seals can hold their breath for like, two hours, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko gave him a sleepy blink and leaned further in to his shoulder. He didn\u2019t even care that his plan should never have worked in the first place and he should have drowned underneath the North Pole and no one would have known.</p>\n<p>Well, they would have known he was <em>dead</em> but not how or when or why; they wouldn\u2019t have known he was coming to help them. Sokka might not have believed he had been.</p>\n<p>Sokka tightened his grip, startling him out of his half-nap. He hadn\u2019t meant to do it, but he couldn\u2019t let him fall back asleep, regardless of how much as Zuko needed it - they really couldn\u2019t afford to have one of their teammates napping, not right then. There was the Siege to think about, after all.</p>\n<p>Zuko shook himself more awake, scrubbing a hand under his good eye, his other hand hovering near his bad eye like it didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t touch his bad eye much.</p>\n<p>(Sokka would be eternally grateful that he couldn\u2019t smell things during a soulbond; he didn\u2019t want his nightmares getting more detailed than they already would be.</p>\n<p>Closing his eyes hadn\u2019t done anything to block out the screams. He could have used his hands but\u2026 Zuko needed them more right then.)</p>\n<p>Zuko pulled halfway out of his grip and Sokka took his arm back, careful to press their sides together. No way Zuko was getting out of physical affection that easily.</p>\n<p>Zuko fiddled with something under his sleeve, cursing under his breath at whatever it was, before (with a little \u201cah-hah\u201d) he pulled out Katara\u2019s necklace.</p>\n<p><em>Mom</em>\u2019s necklace.</p>\n<p>Katara and Yue gave out delighted gasps (both for <em>very different reasons</em>), as Katara eagerly took her necklace back and tied it around her neck. As soon as it was secure she dragged Zuko into a hug, wherein he did a very good impression of a block of wood.</p>\n<p>She pulled back with a steady smile, expression calm, and gave Zuko a little kiss on the cheek before she sat back down. Zuko returned to his place next to Sokka, and Sokka soaked in his firebend-y warmth.</p>\n<p>Yue looked between Zuko and Katara, expression charming and beautiful and ethereal in her mistaken delight.</p>\n<p>Sokka caught her eye and gave a very firm shake of the head, his lip curling. She cocked her head, and her sunbeam smile dimmed to its normal radiance. Sokka let out a small sigh, prompting a nudge and awkward smile from an <em>oh-no-he-knows-everything</em> Prince Zuko.</p>\n<p>Sokka narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat, exactly, did you see in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko had a little shit-eating grin. \u201c<em>Two</em> fishhooks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Sweet Spirits, why?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times did your sister push you into the turtleduck pond?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugged. \u201cLike, a hundred or something. Little sisters are terrifying, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka did not want to answer that when Katara was sitting across from him. There was no right answer there. \u201cSpeaking of family,\u201d he said instead, \u201cdid you see about the Water Tribe tradition-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one where I get to steal your dad?\u201d Zuko asked, and <em>wow, he really was a different person when he smiled.</em> \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna steal your dad. He seems pretty cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was gonna say the one where we get to be brothers-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Zuko pushed his words aside with a wave of his hand, \u201cBut, more importantly, I get your awesome dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ozai, Sokka knew, was objectively the worst person on the planet. There was no one in existence worse than Ozai, and there never had been nor would there ever be one in the future.</p>\n<p>Zuko, in the visions Sokka had seen, had been struggling with that fact. He\u2019d come to terms with the war crimes shortly after seeing their village through Katara\u2019s eyes, but the way his father had treated him never came up in his conversations with Uncle.</p>\n<p>The Zuko he saw now, however, had seen their village and Sokka\u2019s family through the eyes of the under-appreciated somewhat-less-obviously-talented older brother, and saw that Hakoda gave both his children their love equally, and without stipulations.</p>\n<p>Zuko had seen what he needed to see. He understood, he knew what he wanted and he wouoldnt hesitate to go and get it.</p>\n<p>Sokka wrapped his arm back around his shoulder, and Zuko didn\u2019t try to shrug him off.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Their little peaceful bubble cracked the second Aang woke up, shouting about spirits and Zhao and <em>could someone please explain</em> <em>why the moon was a fish?</em></p>\n<p>Zhao appeared, made an attempt at killing the moon \u2013 and, like, Sokka was not the most spiritual guy but that seemed like a bad idea \u2013 failed in his attempt at killing the moon, and was attacked \u2013 and hopefully killed but don\u2019t tell Aang \u2013 by a giant spirit Koi monster and also Aang.</p>\n<p>Sokka slept amazingly well that night, and not just because it was in a pile of soulmates-plus-Yue on the comfiest polar-bear-goose blankets in existence.</p>\n<p>Being royalty seemed pretty great. Maybe it would be worth leaning into the whole Technically-A-Prince thing he had going on, but then he remembered how that had worked out for Zuko.</p>\n<p>Zuko, who was currently curled half into a ball, his back pressed to Sokka\u2019s side, his arms wrapped firmly around Aang in a way that Sokka couldn\u2019t help but laugh at \u2013 <em>he finally caught the Avatar!</em> \u2013 breathing deeply and pushing out steady warmth to fill their little ice room.</p>\n<p>Aang had been so pleased when he woke up to find Zuko there, and had immediately demanded a soulbond. Zuko, insane that he was, was perfectly willing to go along with that despite having only just done one and also being the most tired person in existence.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(\u201cThat\u2019s like, the worst way to show up to a fight, Zuko.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019ve done worse before.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cPlease stop saying that.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHave you ever fought a moose-lion with no swords, no armour and a hangover before?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI hate you. So much.\u201d)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sokka managed to get them to Not Do That, You Idiots, but Aang was adamant that they do it first thing in the morning. Zuko had grumbled about it, but had also stood directly in front of Aang when Zhao appeared, hackles and swords raised, and had only calmed down when Zhao was definitely dead \u2013 and, seriously, <em>don\u2019t tell Aang</em> \u2013 and the invasion had been scared away by Aang\u2019s giant Koi spirit monster.</p>\n<p>Well, Zuko had calmed down if by \u2018calmed down\u2019 one meant \u2018passed out because of these seven different reasons and <em>there really shouldn\u2019t be more than one reason, Zuko.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>(There shouldn\u2019t have been any reasons at all, because Zuko should not be passing out, but Sokka was a realist, not an optimist.)</p>\n<p>Aang had also passed out due to something something spirit-magic, so the group had shoved the two of them somewhere to sleep where they could both be watched together and <em>gee,</em> <em>they did look comfortable.</em></p>\n<p>Sokka was very tired. He was willing to put up with Katara\u2019s silent smirks and her legs on his stomach if it meant he got to be warm and asleep and Yue was there too.</p>\n<p>Sokka wasn\u2019t sure if it was a lie to say he slept well or not. He woke more times than he could count in the night with his face burning and his not-mom disappearing and his boat exploding. Zuko floated slowly in the ice tunnels beneath the North Pole, and Sokka thought he had a hand cramp.</p>\n<p>But every time he woke up Zuko was there, next to him, alive and safe and hopefully not going to do anything stupid now that he had them \u2013 or, Sokka, at least \u2013 to corral him into being safe.</p>\n<p>It was easy to get back to sleep when everyone he cared about was within touching distance.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Zuko opened his eyes the second the sun came up over the horizon. He was surprised to find that he had captured the Avatar, and was confused by the lemur draped across his exposed throat, purring at his natural warmth.</p>\n<p>He turned his head slowly so as to not disturb it, and found his soulmates draped across and around him like they were a litter of puppy-kittens.</p>\n<p>He was unarmed and surrounded and warm and safe. He couldn\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d crossed weapons with these people, nor how many times they\u2019d covered his back the night before.</p>\n<p>He was still tired. He adjusted his grip around Aang\u2019s waist and leaned just a little back into Sokka, close enough that Katara\u2019s foot poked his side, and let himself drift back to sleep.</p>"
