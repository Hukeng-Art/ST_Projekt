  "text": "<p>\u201c<em>Bullshit</em>.\u201d\u00a0 Sh\u014dta seethes, biting the word out with a sharp, clean snap of his teeth.\u00a0 There\u2019s been a potent mix of disbelief and sick cold rage building inside of him since the moment Nezu opened his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, now, Aizawa-kun,\u201d Nezu chides almost absently from where he\u2019s hopped up to sit on the edge of the couch, \u201ccalm down.\u00a0 Getting emotional will not resolve the situation any faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a false accusation and we all know it Nezu,\u201d Sh\u014dta doesn\u2019t bother to acknowledge Nezu\u2019s statement.\u00a0 Instead he just leans forward a bit in his desk chair and does his best not to grind his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had numerous reports besides the initial one all saying the same thing,\u201d Nezu points out calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNumerous reports founded on <em> bullshit</em>,\u201d Sh\u014dta repeats, hands clenched into fists on his desktop.\u00a0 \u201cAnd these students who reported the issue don\u2019t even have regular contact with either Shins\u014d or Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dorm system has brought about an even higher degree of cross year interaction,\u201d Nezu counters.\u00a0 \u201cAdd to that the time students may spend in the halls and cafeteria or various other places on campus as a whole and there\u2019s ample time for unsupervised interactions.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly within corresponding courses,\u201d Sh\u014dta replies even as he reaches out to tap a finger on the top of the small stack of papers Nezu had handed him earlier.\u00a0 \u201cThese students are almost all in upper year Gen Ed. classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re missing the real point here,\u201d Hizashi speaks up then from where he\u2019s been leaning against Sh\u014dta\u2019s desk, arms crossed and a frown tugging at his mouth.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been the only other person in the lounge with Sh\u014dta when Nezu had come in.\u00a0 And given Hizashi\u2019s status as Shins\u014d\u2019s former homeroom teacher and knowing Nezu as he does, Sh\u014dta\u2019s more than a bit certain that was by design.\u00a0 Most things with the principal are.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnlighten us, Yamada-kun,\u201d Nezu prompts cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cShins\u014d <em> adores </em>Midoriya,\u201d Hizashi points out, never one to shy away from the emotional avenue of a situation.\u00a0 He\u2019s always been much more emotionally intelligent and socially aware compared to Sh\u014dta who has always been rooted much more firmly in logic.\u00a0 It\u2019s just one of the many ways they balance each other.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s obvious every time they\u2019re around each other.\u00a0 Shins\u014d wouldn\u2019t do something like this to him.\u00a0 Hell, he wouldn\u2019t have to since Midoriya obviously adores him back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi is, Sh\u014dta knows, completely correct.\u00a0 Even Sh\u014dta had been able to track the two\u2019s speed run of a relationship despite it seeming to come completely out of nowhere in his opinion.\u00a0 But, then again, given how Midoriya had outright maimed himself in the Sports Festival and then somehow came out the other end with Todoroki almost surgically attached to his side, maybe it hadn\u2019t been that unusual.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta\u2019s beginning to believe it might just be a Midoriya thing.</p>\n<p>The kid pretty much wears his heart on his sleeve at any given moment but he\u2019s also kind of unsettling in a way Sh\u014dta just can\u2019t seem to put his finger on no matter how hard he tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of his personal morals and attachment to Midoriya it's still not true,\u201d Sh\u014dta cuts in then because he knows that the emotional avenue isn\u2019t likely to be the argument that sways Nezu no matter how hard Hizashi tries.\u00a0 \u201cThe particulars of Shins\u014d\u2019s quirk don\u2019t work that way.\u00a0 He\u2019s got a hard time limit and prerequisites.\u00a0 The kind of long term manipulation these reports are claiming is something beyond the known scope of his quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hizashi\u2019s quick to say, a wry sort of twist to his mouth as he backs Sh\u014dta up without missing a beat. \u201cAnd, even if it <em> did </em>work like that,\u00a0with as many hits as Midoriya takes during training he\u2019d have snapped out of Shins\u014d\u2019s control ages ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou both make a number of excellent points,\u201d Nezu agrees easily, his version of a smile pulling at his muzzle.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that the suspicion Sh\u014dta\u2019s been harboring in the back of his mind the entire time finally solidifies.</p>\n<p>Because Nezu knows all of this.\u00a0 <em> Of course he does</em>.\u00a0 There are days when Sh\u014dta\u2019s more than a bit convinced that Nezu knows practically everything about everyone in UA.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s anyone who appreciates and lives by the old adage of <em> \u2018knowledge is power\u2019 </em> it\u2019s Nezu.</p>\n<p>So of course he knows all about the ins and outs of Shins\u014d\u2019s quirk.\u00a0 Of course he knows about his relationship with Midoriya even if there\u2019s a self professed, and possibly misleading, disconnect when it comes to the emotional side of the entire matter.</p>\n<p>So Nezu obviously knows that these accusations are, at best, students taking things out of context, or are, at worst, an active attempt to sabotage at least one Hero Course student\u2019s life and career prospects.</p>\n<p>Nezu knows all of this, Sh\u014dta\u2019s sure of it.</p>\n<p>He just doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>There is, as there always seems to be with Nezu, something else at play here.</p>\n<p>Something that Nezu values much more than the impact these rumors might have on two of Sh\u014dta\u2019s students.</p>\n<p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Nezu waves the both of them off as he hops down off of the couch, \u201cwe still have to do our due diligence I\u2019m afraid.\u00a0 Accusations such as these should never be taken lightly.\u00a0 Please bring both Shins\u014d-kun and Midoriya-kun to my office this afternoon once classes are done for the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, as far too often seems to be the case, Sh\u014dta\u2019s obviously more than a few steps behind on whatever scheme Nezu has been cooking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Nezu stops at the door, \u201cand do be sure to not say anything to either Shins\u014d-kun or Midoriya-kun as to the nature of our visit.\u00a0 Seeing their initial reactions in real time will doubtlessly be much more \u2026 <em> informative</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just as quickly as he\u2019d come, Nezu is gone, slipping out of the door silently and off to orchestrate more of his own unique brand of chaos no doubt.</p>\n<p>For a long moment silence hangs thick and heavy over the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s up to something,\u201d Hizashi finally says, shoulders rounding in a sigh as he reaches up to pull his glasses off and massage the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen isn\u2019t he up to something?\u201d Sh\u014dta huffs back, head thunking down onto his desk top.\u00a0 \u201cNezu schemes in his sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Hizashi\u2019s hand is warm and gentle on the nape of Sh\u014dta\u2019s neck, long fingers kneading briefly at the tension that always seems to linger there.\u00a0 \u201cAll we can do is try to head him off at the pass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what we do,\u201d Sh\u014dta turns his head just enough that his words aren\u2019t muffled by the wood anymore.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019ll have already thought about it and found ways around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t still try,\u201d Hizashi points out softly, hand squeezing his nape lightly before he lets go.\u00a0 \u201cNow come on, kitten, time to get moving.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a little time before classes start so let\u2019s do what we can to make sure the little listeners make it out of whatever this is in one piece.\u00a0 We can worry about everything else afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta gives himself another moment before he pushes himself up from his chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch Inui up to speed,\u201d Sh\u014dta tells him.\u00a0 \u201cIf Nezu wants to have some kind of meeting with those two about this without calling in either Midoriya-san or Shins\u014d\u2019s guardians then he shouldn\u2019t refuse to allow a licensed pro and a counselor to sit in.\u00a0 You can get Recovery Girl to come too since she\u2019s actually speaking to you right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Hizashi agrees easily enough, glasses back in place and thumbs hooked over his belt buckle.\u00a0 \u201cCounselor and school nurse, check and check.\u00a0 Me and you will both be expected to go, obviously, otherwise Nezu would\u2019ve just cornered you with this instead of both of us.\u00a0 So that\u2019s at least four people who can try and keep him in check.\u00a0 Think that\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sh\u014dta nods even as he knows it\u2019s a lie.\u00a0 There\u2019s really no such thing as keeping Nezu in check unless he allows it and there\u2019s at least one other person they should probably be including on this for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>And if the look Hizashi cuts at him over the rim of his glasses is anything to go by, he knows it as well.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine</em>,\u201d Sh\u014dta sighs, \u201cI\u2019ll get the idiot.\u00a0 But it\u2019ll be after he deals with the Hell Class for the day.\u00a0 There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll keep his mouth shut otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because, as Sh\u014dta has learned the hard way, if it involves Midoriya then it already does, or eventually will, also involve Yagi.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The rest of the day passes in a semi-peaceful manner overall.</p>\n<p>Even when he tells both Midoriya and Shins\u014d to come to the teacher\u2019s lounge after class, nothing more pressing than Bakug\u014d and Kaminari both existing in close proximity to Sh\u014dta\u2019s last, fragile nerve happens.</p>\n<p>Even the extra close eye Sh\u014dta keeps on Shins\u014d and Midoriya, as well as the rest of their group of not so subtle delinquents by default, at every opportunity throughout the day doesn\u2019t see anything too far out of the ordinary beyond Shins\u014d looking a little more tired than normal.</p>\n<p>There are no signs of guilt or panic in Shins\u014d as far as Sh\u014dta can see, and no fear or relief to be found in Midoriya\u2019s normal sort of jittery intensity.</p>\n<p>There's no sign that he can find that points to there being any truth to those rumors to be seen in either of his students.</p>\n<p>It sets a small part of Sh\u014dta to ease, seeing the day continue on as if nothing\u2019s amiss even as a tension of sorts that Sh\u014dta can\u2019t seem to shake settles itself across his shoulders.\u00a0 It\u2019s an almost electric feeling, like the calm before the storm, that seems content to build on itself.</p>\n<p>He does his best to tuck it away because, as Hizashi had said, the most important thing is to get the two boys through whatever it is Nezu\u2019s trying to pull in one piece.</p>\n<p>Then, hopefully, they can all move on and handle whatever comes afterwards later.</p>\n<p>And, more importantly, Sh\u014dta can concentrate on getting to the bottom of these bullshit accusations.\u00a0 Because if they haven\u2019t been made in good faith, if he finds out there\u2019s a more <em> sinister </em>reasoning behind any of it \u2026</p>\n<p><em> Well</em>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason why Sh\u014dta has the highest expulsion rate in UA history and, contrary to popular belief, not all of those students were in the Hero Course.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>When Shins\u014d and Midoriya show up at the teacher\u2019s lounge after classes just as instructed, Sh\u014dta wastes no time in leading the way to Nezu\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>They weave their way through the twists and turns of UA in silence before they finally come to a stop outside a door that pops open before Sh\u014dta can knock.\u00a0 Nezu and more of the little mind games and power plays he always seems to enjoy so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei,\u201d Nezu calls out from within the room, \u201cright on time as always.\u00a0 Do come inside.\u00a0 Shins\u014d-kun and Midoriya-kun as well of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eager to get this done and over with, Sh\u014dta steps through the door, Shins\u014d and Midoriya following on his heels like silent little shadows.</p>\n<p>Nezu sits behind his desk, customary teacup in hand and eyes fixed on Sh\u014dta\u2019s students with an intensity that makes the hair on the back of his neck rise up just a bit.</p>\n<p>Still Sh\u014dta bites his tongue and moves to stand against the wall beside a Hizashi who looks to be trying his best to stay calm and collected.\u00a0 There\u2019s a grounding press of knuckles against the side of his leg that have him shifting his feet enough to press the toe of his boot against Hizashi\u2019s in a firm but subtle nudge of acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta\u2019s unsurprised to see a grim faced Yagi settled into another chair between a pursed lipped Recovery Girl and an irritable looking Hound Dog.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Nezu speaks up then, waving one paw in Shins\u014d and Midoriya\u2019s direction, \u201ccome sit down so we can get started.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya and Shins\u014d move forward together, steps almost completely in sync, as they settle down into the two empty chairs sitting in front of Nezu\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Are we in some kind of trouble?\u201d\u00a0 Midoriya is, unsurprisingly enough, the one who breaks the silence first, hands fidgeting with the material of his pants before he plants them on the arms of his chair instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a rather delicate situation,\u201d Nezu side steps the boy\u2019s question easily, teacup clicking against the saucer as he sets it down.\u00a0 \u201cSo, perhaps, it would be more beneficial to the proceedings to simply dive right in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta bites back the urge to sneer.\u00a0 The anger that had clawed at him earlier this morning has spent the day festering in his gut, becoming something molten hot and churning in the process.</p>\n<p>He stays quiet for the same reason he\u2019d chosen to listen to Nezu and not to confront Midoriya or Shins\u014d about the rumors on his own.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only way to see what Nezu\u2019s playing at, the only way to get him to tip at least a portion of his hand right here and now.\u00a0 Because if he missteps too soon then Sh\u014dta knows that Nezu will simply recalibrate and get at the boys in a different, less semi-controlled way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems there\u2019s been a few rather \u2026 unsettling accusations put forth from a number of different directions,\u201d Nezu says delicately.\u00a0 \u201cSo, first and foremost, Midoriya-kun I have to ask if you are safe?\u00a0 Is there anything you\u2019d like to report?\u00a0 This is a safe place where no harm will come to you so please speak freely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s brow furrows and his mouth turns down sharply.\u00a0 \u201cI-I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has come to the attention of the staff and myself,\u201d Nezu replies, something dark and calculating in his gaze that almost makes Sh\u014dta want to step in between the chimera and the boys, \u201cthat there is a possibility that your relationship with Shins\u014d-kun is ... non consensual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shins\u014d flinches so abruptly and sharply that Sh\u014dta feels it in his <em> bones </em>as the boy\u2019s expression twists in some sick mix of disgust and despair.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019d been any doubt in him as to whether or not Shins\u014d could have really been taking advantage of Midoriya in such a way it would have been erased in that moment.</p>\n<p>But then it\u2019s Midoriya\u2019s reaction that grabs Sh\u014dta\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>Because, beside Shins\u014d, Midoriya instantly goes almost dangerously still in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cElaborate.\u201d\u00a0 Midoriya\u2019s voice is solid, steady in a way that Sh\u014dta\u2019s never really heard before.</p>\n<p>Between one breath and another Sh\u014dta finds himself standing straight and alert.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if the tone of Midoriya\u2019s voice has reached inside of Sh\u014dta\u2019s chest and grabbed at something that instantly forces Sh\u014dta up off of the wall.\u00a0 Unease coiling in his chest, Sh\u014dta keeps his eyes locked on Midoriya still form, his shoulders tense in instinctive preparation.</p>\n<p>\u201cMultiple students have expressed concerns for your safety on the basis that Shins\u014d-kun may have \u2026 coerced you into a romantic relationship,\u201d Nezu says evenly, as if he doesn\u2019t notice the sudden and dramatic uptick in the undercurrent of tension sparking across the room.\u00a0 \u201cNaturally the staff must investigate all such complaints thoroughly for the safety of the students in question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Midoriya echoes, an eerie sort of blankness in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow Shins\u014d-kun,\u201d Nezu turns his attention in Shins\u014d\u2019s direction then, \u201cdo you have anything to say in your defense?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta turns his attention towards a grey faced Shins\u014d who opens his mouth as if he\u2019s going to speak.\u00a0 But before he can say anything there\u2019s suddenly a sharp splintering sound that makes Sh\u014dta twitch more than he wants to admit.</p>\n<p>Attention swinging back towards his other student, Sh\u014dta feels his own eyes go wide at the sight of the arms of the chair Midoriya\u2019s been gripping have practically crumbled to the ground on either side of him.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been utterly shattered by the strength of Midoriya\u2019s hold on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy boy,\u201d Yagi leans forward in his seat as he speaks up, skeletal face creased even deeper than normal.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a smart move in Sh\u014dta\u2019s opinion.\u00a0 Whatever relationship those two might have still baffles Sh\u014dta on a number of levels but it\u2019s obvious to anyone who has ever been around them that there\u2019s a connection between Midoriya and Yagi.\u00a0 If anyone in the room besides Shins\u014d can calm the boy down it\u2019s sure to be the former number one.</p>\n<p>Only, Sh\u014dta quickly realizes, that\u2019s apparently not as true as he\u2019s always assumed it would be.</p>\n<p>Standing where he is, Sh\u014dta can\u2019t see the look that Midoriya cuts in Yagi\u2019s direction but whatever his expression is, it\u2019s more than enough to shut Yagi up instantly.\u00a0 Yagi leans back in his chair, his face gone slightly chalky, and turns to stare directly ahead instead of saying anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem upset, Midoriya-kun,\u201d Nezu says calmly, unruffled by Midoriya\u2019s outburst.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact Sh\u014dta would even say there\u2019s something almost <em> gleeful </em>in his tone.\u00a0 Which is something Sh\u014dta intimately dislikes on a number of levels for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>One of which being the fact that a gleeful Nezu is <em> never </em>a good sign for anyone involved.</p>\n<p>\u201cUpset?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s head tilts to the side just a bit as he turns back to look at the principal, an almost animal-like gesture Sh\u014dta\u2019s only ever seen him perform once or twice before.\u00a0 The last time had been right at the beginning of his now infamous confrontation with Mineta.\u00a0 \u201cThat seems like such a <em> mild </em>word for what I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Nezu smiles just a bit, an expression that sits unnaturally on his face and, again, absolutely never bodes well, \u201c<em>elaborate</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>sir</em>,\u201d Midoriya starts, more blatant disrespect condensed down in his voice than Sh\u014dta\u2019s <em> ever </em>heard from the kid, \u201cI find it really distasteful that someone would accuse Shins\u014d of conduct unbecoming of a hero student on this level and that the staff here would humor it at all since everyone in this room knows it\u2019s false.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said before, all complaints of this nature must be taken seriously,\u201d Nezu counter, tone mild.\u00a0 He\u2019s obviously still toeing the same line he\u2019d fed Sh\u014dta and Hizashi both.\u00a0 The same one they\u2019d both known was bullshit the moment it had come out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bullshit</em>,\u201d Midoriya practically spits the word like he\u2019s plucked it right out of Sh\u014dta\u2019s thoughts, surging to his feet and leaning forward enough to slam his hands down on Nezu\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>The wood dents in around Midoriya\u2019s palms but Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem to notice, too caught up in his staring contest with Nezu.\u00a0 It\u2019s a show of pure strength that is honestly more than a bit unnerving.</p>\n<p>Shenanigans aside, Midoriya\u2019s normally so unassuming that Sh\u014dta sometimes forgets the sheer strength the kid is capable of without even bothering to pull on his quirk.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta knows then that this entire thing has somehow managed to get even more out of hand than it already was.\u00a0 And given the subject matter, it was already <em> pretty fucking far </em> out of hand in Sh\u014dta\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p>Either way though he knows he needs to step in now, needs to make sure Midoriya doesn\u2019t say or do anything he\u2019ll regret.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta will be damned if he\u2019ll lose either of these two kids to teenage tempers, no matter how righteous, and whatever the hell kind of game Nezu\u2019s trying to play.</p>\n<p>\u201cPro-,\u201d Sh\u014dta takes a step forward then, one hand already on his capture scarf as a precaution.</p>\n<p>The look Midoriya shoots in his direction is almost enough to have him taking that same step back and away instinctively.</p>\n<p>Instead Sh\u014dta does something he hasn\u2019t done since he was a student, since he was younger than Midoriya himself is now.</p>\n<p>He freezes.</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s normal mix of cheerful but determined anxiety is gone from his expression.\u00a0 In its place is something that Sh\u014dta can only describe as <em> dangerous</em>.\u00a0 His mouth is twisted into what can only be described as a snarl and his eyes are dark and <em> sharp</em>.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta\u2019s sure that, for a split second at least, he can see the familiar jade lightning of Midoriya\u2019s quirk sparking in the depth of his eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a look he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d be on the receiving end of from one of his students, especially not <em> Midoriya </em>of all people no matter how much the kid has occasionally unsettled him in the past.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a look that makes Sh\u014dta feel almost \u2026 <em> hunted</em>.</p>\n<p>But then it\u2019s gone, Midoriya turning his attention back towards Nezu as if he hadn\u2019t damn near stopped Sh\u014dta\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cHitoshi has never and would never attempt to force me into anything against my will outside of consensual and authorized quirk training.\u201d Midoriya practically bites the words out, diction sharp enough to make even mini-Tensei proud.\u00a0 \u201cBecause that\u2019s what this is about right?\u00a0 His quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Nezu smooths one paw over the top of the other, a pleased sort of stimming motion that Sh\u014dta recognizes well, and keeps his eyes firmly on Midoriya\u2019s face, \u201cwe are obligated to investigate all accusations of such a nature.\u00a0 Especially where hero students are concerned.\u00a0 For a variety of reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why did it take so long for Mineta to get expelled?\u201d Midoriya shoots back viciously.\u00a0 The way he practically flings the question at Nezu makes Sh\u014dta bite back a snarl of remembered frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Midoriya plows on, not bothering to pause, \u201cwas he allowed to terrorize our female classmates for so long despite multiple complaints against him but Ikeda and his friends, because we all know that\u2019s where this came from, launch a campaign against Hitoshi and you all immediately jump to this.\u201d\u00a0 Midoriya lifts a hand to wave it around the office before he slams it back down onto the desk, denting the wood yet again.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t bother to answer that, I already know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even with his unease from moments before still swirling inside of him Sh\u014dta can\u2019t help but agree with Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Mineta and his continued enrollment in the Hero Course had been an issue for Sh\u014dta since the day Nezu had rejected his first expulsion form for the lecherous brat.</p>\n<p>Nezu had, just as Midoriya had obviously figured out somehow, had plans that involved Mineta that caused him to utilize his rarely touched veto power as to who remained in Sh\u014dta\u2019s class.</p>\n<p>The argument they\u2019d had afterwards had been vicious by their standards but Nezu had stood firm on the issue for months even as the complaints piled up.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta had broken more than one mug from Hizashi\u2019s shatter cabinet out of sheer frustration.\u00a0 He has never and will never appreciate Nezu\u2019s politics and schemes impacting his class so blatantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Nezu starts to speak up then but this time Midoriya doesn\u2019t let him finish.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already knew how this school handles outright violence between classmates,\u201d Midoriya keeps going more than a bit viciously. \u201cBut I had hoped it wouldn\u2019t support blatant quirk discrimination beyond the obvious bias of the entrance exam.\u00a0 I guess that was my mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him Hizashi breathes out a low hiss of air that Sh\u014dta feels reverberate in his <em> soul</em>.</p>\n<p>Ice traces its way down Sh\u014dta\u2019s spine yet again.</p>\n<p>The more physical aspect of heroics training has never been something Midoriya has ever complained about.\u00a0 Sh\u014dta knows that for a fact.\u00a0 If anything it\u2019s been the opposite problem with Midoriya who always seems so eager to overwork himself.</p>\n<p>So the fact that he's brought <em>'violence between classmates'</em> up at all is a red flag of epic proportions.</p>\n<p>And the accusations of blatant quirk discrimination hit just as hard.</p>\n<p>Because Sh\u014dta knows exactly how this looks from the outside.\u00a0 Knows intimately how this must look to Shins\u014d and Midoriya both.\u00a0 And he <em> hates </em>it.\u00a0 Hates that Nezu has put them all in this position, placed them firmly on one side of the equation and his students on the other by the way he\u2019s chosen to handle this entire thing.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta even hates himself just a bit for having gone along with it as much as he has so far.</p>\n<p>Because, biased entrance exam notwithstanding, Sh\u014dta\u2019s has always tried to stamp out any quirk related prejudice he comes across.</p>\n<p>He and Hizashi both had suffered enough of that growing up.\u00a0 Have seen the results more times than they can count while out on patrol.\u00a0 Neither of them are willing to just deal with or blatantly ignore it in their classrooms or from their students now.</p>\n<p>But it seems that, somewhere along the way, Sh\u014dta has missed more than one step where at least these two are concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d Midoriya continues lowly, \u201cmy mistake was applying here at all.\u00a0 Maybe UA isn\u2019t the best choice of hero schools if they\u2019re going to entertain accusations that are blatantly false and made by a group of students led by someone who has been verbally and physically assaulting Hitoshi for weeks now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chill that almost seems to sweep through the room is no match for the rage that roars even higher inside of Sh\u014dta.</p>\n<p>The thought of Ikeda hurting Shins\u014d like Midoriya is saying, of any of the upperclassmen laying hands on one of his kids like that outside of training is enough to have Sh\u014dta clenching his fist around his scarf so hard his knuckles pop.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeyond the fact that he would never do something so villainous, Hitoshi\u2019s quirk is a call-and-response based emitter that I\u2019ve already proven I can break out of independent of outside assistance,\u201d Midoriya keeps going.\u00a0 \u201cIkeda Kino is just jealous that Hitoshi has done what he never could and never will do himself, earn his spot in A-Class.\u00a0 Hitoshi\u2019s going to be a fantastic hero and I refuse to be used as an excuse to damage his reputation and record.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya straightens up then, hands pulling themselves out of Nezu\u2019s desk as he turns just enough to bend down and grab his bag up off of the floor.\u00a0 He rifles through it for a few seconds before he pulls out a black covered notebook.\u00a0 He places it almost delicately onto Nezu\u2019s ruined desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has everything I\u2019ve managed to gather on Ikeda Kino and his group of friends,\u201d Midoriya tells Nezu, holding the principal\u2019s gaze with a steadiness that far too few are capable of.\u00a0 \u201cIt also has a complete log of every insult and instance of assault Hitoshi\u2019s been subjected to in the past few months.\u00a0 You can cross check with Recovery Girl\u2019s records for any injuries and I\u2019m sure you have other sources you can consult too for these kinds of occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta can\u2019t help the thrill of surprise he feels at what Midoriya\u2019s so easily handed over.\u00a0 One of his mysterious notebooks, something he normally guards so completely and fiercely that not even Bakug\u014d gets near them anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cHitoshi deserves an apology for this,\u201d Midoriya practically declares then, like he isn\u2019t attempting to wring something out of Nezu that Sh\u014dta\u2019s not even sure the principal is legitimately capable of sincerely giving.\u00a0 \u201cAnd if UA really is the best of the best then Ikeda deserves to be punished.\u00a0 His record deserves a black mark for false accusations and quirk discrimination as well as multiple instances of assaulting a fellow student.\u00a0 And if those things don\u2019t happen then I\u2019ll do whatever I have to in order to make sure they happen anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta agrees with him of course.\u00a0 Ikeda and his other little cohorts are going to be <em> punished</em>.\u00a0 As far as Sh\u014dta\u2019s concerned their time left in UA is numbering in <em> hours </em>now and that\u2019s something Nezu will either accept or Sh\u014dta will take drastic measures of his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a threat, Midoriya-kun?\u201d Nezu speaks up then, paws smoothing almost greedily across the cover of the notebook Midoriya had passed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya immediately denies, that solid sort of steadiness from before etched in every line of him.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a statement of fact.\u00a0 If Hitoshi gets punished for this, if his record is damaged and Ikeda is allowed to get away without any consequences then I will be withdrawing from UA and attending a different heroics course elsewhere.\u00a0 I will also do my best to take as many of my classmates with me as I can when I go.\u00a0 And then I will scream every single mistake and misstep I\u2019ve seen UA make from the rooftops.\u00a0 And I won\u2019t stop even after I climb the ranks.\u00a0 I\u2019ll keep going until people have no choice but to take me seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta blinks once, twice, a third time.</p>\n<p>Because Midoriya is absolutely serious.</p>\n<p>And Sh\u014dta, more than the rest of the staff except Nezu perhaps, understands just how big of a threat that statement of fact actually is.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s at least a half a dozen students in his homeroom alone that Sh\u014dta\u2019s sure would follow Midoriya without hesitation.\u00a0 Even more than that who would then likely be easy to sway to his side and a few who would stand with Shins\u014d even without Midoriya\u2019s influence.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not taking into account students in the other classes who Sh\u014dta\u2019s sure would also get caught up in Midoriya's wake.\u00a0 Especially once his reasoning and accusations against UA and the staff was announced.</p>\n<p>Midoriya, for all that he never seems to truly realize it, has a strange sort of charisma to him.\u00a0 Especially with Shins\u014d at his side now, grounding him in a way that he hadn\u2019t had before.</p>\n<p>If, Sh\u014dta realizes, Midoriya truly puts his mind to it as he\u2019s saying he will, they could be looking at a willing mass exodus of hero students the likes of which UA has never seen in its history.</p>\n<p>That alone would be enough to give the school\u2019s credibility a serious hit.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not even taking into account the <em> staff </em>who might also see fit to resign as well.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta has no illusions over the fact that, should Midoriya leave, Yagi won\u2019t be far behind.</p>\n<p>Which, of course, means that Nezu knows all of this as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Nezu says quietly.</p>\n<p>And then he <em> grins</em>, an almost unnaturally wide and tooth filled expression, that makes Sh\u014dta\u2019s eyes narrow suspiciously when he immediately turns it in Shins\u014d\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do apologize for this unpleasant matter making it so far Shins\u014d-kun,\u201d Nezu announces calmly, as if the past ten minutes have gone differently than how Sh\u014dta knows they did.\u00a0 \u201cWe will of course take all of this into consideration and conduct a proper investigation.\u00a0 But given the vehemence of Midoriya-kun\u2019s defense of you I think it\u2019s safe to say your record will remain clean here.\u00a0 Please do keep up the hard work and leave the rest of this <em> mess </em>to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya, in another stunning show of uncharacteristic rudeness, steps back and reaches down to grab Shins\u014d\u2019s hand.\u00a0 He pulls him up out of his seat, Shins\u014d fumbling to grab his bag as he stands, and then sketches a small barely there bow in Nezu\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to the dorms now.\u201d\u00a0 Midoriya announces more than anything as he ushers Shins\u014d past where Sh\u014dta\u2019s standing without even looking in his direction.</p>\n<p>The door swings shut behind them quietly.</p>\n<p>For a long, charged moment the office sits in complete silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Sh\u014dta takes another step forward away from the wall, and then another and another until he\u2019s hovering just in front of Nezu\u2019s ruined desk, \u201cthe <em> fuck </em>was that, Nezu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about Aizawa-kun,\u201d Nezu blinks up at him, paws pressed flat against the cover of the notebook he can\u2019t seem to stop touching.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t</em>,\u201d Sh\u014dta says sharply, resisting the urge to add a hand print of his own to Nezu\u2019s tattered desktop.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t play games with me Nezu, not right now.\u00a0 Not after you\u2019ve gone a step too far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I now?\u201d Nezu tilts his head to the side just a bit, black eyes gleaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sh\u014dta hisses.\u00a0 \u201cYou were going to back Shins\u014d into a corner even though we all knew from the onset those accusations were false.\u00a0 Don\u2019t deny it.\u00a0 I could see it.\u00a0 <em> Midoriya </em>could see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I had certainly hoped he would when this entire matter started,\u201d Nezu says easily.\u00a0 \u201cIt would have defeated the entire purpose of the exercise if Midoriya-kun hadn\u2019t been able to see just how damaging such accusation would have been to Shins\u014d-kun.\u00a0 Thankfully he didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta goes abruptly still, mind click, click, clicking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Nezu says just a tad quieter, that earlier glee creeping in around the edges of his tone, \u201cI would even go so far as to say Midoriya-kun achieved high marks all the way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNezu,\u201d Yagi is the one who speaks up then, something tight and controlled in his voice.\u00a0 \u201cWhat, exactly, are you implying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas any of it real?\u201d Sh\u014dta cuts in, dread and rage twisting together in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Aizawa-kun, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Nezu waves a dismissive paw in his direction.\u00a0 \u201cI wasn\u2019t forced to go so far as to fabricate the entire thing.\u00a0 Ikeda-kun, while relatively charismatic, happens to be quite the jealous bigot.\u00a0 Plus he has, just as Midoriya-kun stated, been physically and verbally harassing Shins\u014d-kun for weeks now.\u00a0 This was just the next step in a pattern of steady but ultimately petty escalation on his part.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy expelling him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you just let that harassment continue?\u201d\u00a0 Hizashi speaks up for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Nezu nods.\u00a0 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to last forever and if I had interfered it would have reset the entire board.\u00a0 I would have been forced to implement another game plan to get what I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nezu taps meaningfully at the notebook Midoriya had given him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of that,\u201d Yagi speaks slowly, sounding more than a bit out of his depth in a way Sh\u014dta can\u2019t actually fault him for, \u201cto get one of young Midoriya\u2019s notebooks?\u00a0 You could have simply asked him, Nezu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Nezu chides lightly.\u00a0 \u201cBetter for something like this to be given than asked for.\u00a0 A gift of justice instead of a request or a concession Midoriya would have felt trapped into providing.\u00a0 No, this was a much better inroad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Shins\u014d was what?\u201d Sh\u014dta snaps.\u00a0 \u201cJust collateral damage?\u00a0 An acceptable sacrifice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Nezu denies steadily.\u00a0 \u201cShins\u014d-kun was never in any real danger from those accusations.\u00a0 He\u2019s innocent after all and far too important to be wasted in such a manner.\u00a0 I simply needed both of them to <em> believe </em>he was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em> sick</em>,\u201d Hizashi says quietly, solemnly.\u00a0 \u201cNezu, that\u2019s just ... <em> why </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Nezu hums lightly, sliding the notebook off to the side of his desk with a flick of his paw before he reaches for his ever present teapot and a fresh cup.\u00a0 \u201cThe answer to that is rather simple really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnlighten us,\u201d Sh\u014dta practically sneers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to meet the <em> real </em>Midoriya,\u201d Nezu tells them, paws steady as he pours his tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hizashi asks, giving voice to the confusion that\u2019s practically saturating the room at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a quote from an old pre-Quirk dictator,\u201d Nezu tells them after a long sip of tea, \u201cit goes, <em> \u2018Live with a man forty years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.\u2019 </em> It\u2019s fanciful ideological speculation made by a long dead psychopath but I admit that I agree with the spirit of the ideal if not the letter.\u00a0 But, alas, I don\u2019t have forty years to spend analyzing Midoriya.\u00a0 And, unlike many pro-heroes even, Midoriya is singularly driven not by his own safety but by the safety of others.\u00a0 To meet him, to truly <em> see </em>him, I needed to hang the most intimate part of his heart over the volcano's edge instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yagi sucks in a ragged breath and Sh\u014dta can just barely hear the rumbling growl of displeasure Inui is making over the pounding of his own heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yagi coughs the question out.\u00a0 \u201cYoung Midoriya is a good boy, he\u2019s going to be a fantastic hero.\u00a0 Why all of this just to<em> meet him</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple really.\u00a0 It\u2019s because Midoriya-kun is our future number one hero,\u201d Nezu says simply, with such easy conviction that it startles Sh\u014dta more than a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You son of a bitch</em>,\u201d Sh\u014dta seethes quietly.\u00a0 \u201cYou could have, <em> probably have</em>, damaged the trust two of my students have in me and this school irreparably.\u00a0 And for what?\u00a0 For a <em> notebook </em> and some sick <em> thought experimen</em><em>t?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s yet another moment of almost tangible quiet.</p>\n<p>And then Nezu lets out what can only be described as a giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Aizawa-kun,\u201d Nezu says lightly, some mix of amusement and what on anyone else could have almost been pity in his tone.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think either of those boys <em> actually </em>trusts you do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>In that moment Sh\u014dta\u2019s sure that he stops breathing entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nezu continues calmly, \u201cneither Midoriya-kun nor Shins\u014d-kun trust anyone, expect, perhaps, each other completely.\u00a0 And they <em> certainly </em> don\u2019t trust any of us beyond our roles as pro-heroes.\u00a0 The way they held their silence about this entire situation instead of reaching out is proof enough of that.\u00a0 Even Midoriya-kun\u2019s adoration of Yagi-kun is, in a word, \u2026 <em> conditional</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The noise Yagi makes is somewhere between a ragged, bloody cough and a barely hidden whine. Recovery Girl is quick to reach for him, a severe frown pulling at her aged face but something almost accepting in her eyes.</p>\n<p>Nezu reaches up then and ghosts the side of one sharp tipped claw down the scar that cuts through his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can take my word as <em> law </em>on that fact,\u201d Nezu flashes a sharp toothed grin in Sh\u014dta\u2019s direction then.\u00a0 \u201cLike recognizes like after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose two are nothing like you,\u201d Sh\u014dta can\u2019t help but say.\u00a0 Because they\u2019re not.\u00a0 There\u2019s a coldness, a <em> ruthlessness</em>, in Nezu that Sh\u014dta\u2019s never seen in either of his students.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really so sure?\u201d Nezu cuts back.\u00a0 \u201cOr is that just what you <em> want </em>to be true?\u00a0 Because I believe there\u2019s a number of parallels between us.\u00a0 Midoriya-kun and I most of all but young Shins\u014d-kun isn\u2019t so easily dismissed either.\u00a0 In fact I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll play a pivotal role in the future going forward.\u00a0 Neither he nor Midoriya-kun are, after all, the type to let go of what they love easily.\u00a0 No, I believe that at least one of our future number one\u2019s sides is rather firmly spoken for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nezu sips his tea, an air of almost smug contemplation practically wafting off of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve allowed Midoriya to grow on his own for long enough I believe,\u201d Nezu says.\u00a0 \u201cPerhaps I should have stepped in earlier when I realized that you didn\u2019t see him for what he is, Aizawa-kun.\u00a0 That was my mistake.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a mistake that ends now.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be reporting to my office for his study hall period from now on and Shins\u014d-kun will rotate through a selection of staff members who will be tasked with rounding out his skill set.\u00a0 We have so much to accomplish and relatively little time to do it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nezu pauses, drinks more of his tea, and then sets his cup back on its saucer with a delicate click.\u00a0 He reaches for the notebook Midoriya had given him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Nezu says lightly but tone full of obvious dismissal, \u201cif you would all kindly see yourselves out I\u2019m afraid I have a new project to begin.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Hizashi at his back and the others standing off to one side, Sh\u014dta stands there in front of Nezu\u2019s desk for a long moment before he turns on his heel and stalks out of the office.</p>\n<p>There is, he\u2019s loathe to admit, nothing else he can do at the moment.</p>\n<p>He knows without even bothering to press the issue that Nezu won\u2019t bend any further today.\u00a0 And, as much as he wants more information, Sh\u014dta doesn\u2019t want to ambush and overwhelm either Midoriya or Shins\u014d again so soon.</p>\n<p>So for now all he can do is what he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d handle earlier.</p>\n<p>He has a student to expel and at least a half dozen more to verbally flay.</p>\n<p>And then he has a lot of thinking to do.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta doesn\u2019t stir from his place on the couch when Hizashi finally makes his way into their apartment a few hours later.</p>\n<p>Hizashi toes his boots off, takes a look at the fresh hole in the wall and the already purpling skin of Sh\u014dta\u2019s knuckles, and sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, kitten,\u201d Hizashi says quietly as he settles down on the couch and holds one arm up.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta tips himself to the side without a word, eyes closing as he focuses on the familiar and comforting warmth and scent that envelops him.</p>\n<p>They sit there together in silence for the longest time.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne hell of a day huh?\u201d Hizashi finally murmurs as he combs a hand gently through Sh\u014dta\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta just grunts lowly in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cIkeda was still crying the last I saw him but he\u2019ll be off campus before nightfall,\u201d Hizashi tells him.\u00a0 \u201cNot sure where he\u2019ll go since no other high school in the country is going to take him after what you did to his record though.\u00a0 And the rest of his little group will be having detention with Nemuri until the semester ends, may the gods rest their souls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle bastards,\u201d Sh\u014dta huffs against Hizashi\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hizashi agrees.</p>\n<p>Silence falls over them again, but it\u2019s a long familiar and ultimately comfortable one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Hizashi finally sighs, cutting to the core of what\u2019s bothering Sh\u014dta in that way he always seems able to.\u00a0 \u201cTogether.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do whatever we have to in order to make sure the little listeners know we\u2019re on their side.\u00a0 No matter what other games Nezu might have in mind.\u00a0 They might not trust us now but we\u2019ll work at it until they do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi says it like it\u2019s law, like it\u2019s some kind of undeniable fact.\u00a0 Says it in a voice filled with all of the determination and strength that so many people tend to overlook in him.</p>\n<p>It helps that he\u2019s simply giving voice to what Sh\u014dta\u2019s spent the last few hours contemplating.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d missed a step with Midoriya and Shins\u014d both somehow, they all had apparently.</p>\n<p>But, as always, it\u2019s his own failure that eats at Sh\u014dta.\u00a0 It\u2019s the fact that he had missed such a large chunk of the picture that it\u2019s making him think there might be even more things he\u2019s somehow allowed himself to be blind to with this class.\u00a0 Things he should have seen and acted on ages ago.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta feels as if some veil he hadn\u2019t known he was wearing has finally been ripped away.\u00a0 Like he\u2019s seeing clearly for the first time in a long time.</p>\n<p>Somehow he\u2019d fallen victim to the observational bias he\u2019s always railed so hard against.\u00a0 He\u2019d made assumptions and leaps and never realized just where he was going wrong in the process.</p>\n<p>But that ends here and now.\u00a0 Had, in fact, ended back in Nezu\u2019s office with his student\u2019s distrust being thrown so casually in his face.</p>\n<p>This time Sh\u014dta\u2019s determined to see things for what they <em> are </em>instead of what he thinks they should be.</p>\n<p>This time he\u2019s going to give Midoriya and Shins\u014d and every other kid in his class who might need them undeniably solid reasons to actually trust him.</p>\n<p>Sh\u014dta\u2019s not going to let any of them down again.</p>\n<p>Plus Ultra.</p>"
