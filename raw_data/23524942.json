  "text": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawks can <em>handle</em> pain; he wouldn\u2019t be the number two hero without having an extremely high pain tolerance to go with his pretty face and capable body. As a hero, it's almost his job to be able to handle it; villains don\u2019t care if you rolled your ankle while trying to send them to jail (and all heroes had done that at least once, no matter how many denied it). At some point, pain just doesn\u2019t register for heroes, and finding bruises in random places is just expected. If he wanted to get more dramatic with it, he could say that pain is more of a friend than a stranger, and Hawks can usually handle it with the same familiarity that he handles spicy food. But currently, his back feels like it was hacked at with a weed-wacker, pulsing from the beating he\u2019d gotten not even twenty minutes ago, and he isn\u2019t handling as well as he should be. The thin cuts <em>burn</em> with his jacket pressed against them, his head is pounding, his wrists and neck feel rubbed raw, and his wings ache, but it could have been so much worse. It was <em>supposed</em> to be so much worse. The only reason it <em>wasn\u2019t</em> was because he\u2019d had to meet up with Dabi, and his handlers prioritized potential information over his continued punishment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On one hand it <em>sucks</em>; he can\u2019t even go back to his apartment and wallow because he has to meet with the league. Tonight was supposed to just be a weekly game night that he\u2019s been roped into far too many times before, meaning that the only <em>valuable</em> thing he would be getting was monopoly money and bragging rights. (Skipping out isn\u2019t an option; he learned that the hard way when he skipped and woke up with Dabi\u2019s unimpressed face looming over him and the league in his living room.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, everything hurts and he just wants to flop onto his uncomfortable bed in his stylishly empty apartment and not get up until someone (either his handler or Dabi) finds his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both hands are pretty much the same; Hawks doesn\u2019t really see a positive side to his current situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, he isn\u2019t even sure what he did to deserve the punishment, but he\u2019s <em>almost certain</em> that he deserved it. His handlers wouldn\u2019t discipline him without a reason, however harsh they may be at times. Out of all of the things the commission does to make his life hard, they just want him to be better. They even avoided hurting his wings when they punished him, leaving him able to do his job, which is the job that they<em> want</em> and the people <em>need</em> for him to do. And as grateful as he is that he can at least still do what he was trained for, it doesn\u2019t lessen the <em>agony</em> that his back is going through as he hurries to throw on his jacket. The skin around his wings hadn\u2019t escaped the punishment and Hawks is almost positive that he can feel the skin splitting as if he was still being punished, as if whatever they had been using to hit him was still being whipped against his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> It burned harshly, and almost felt jagged as it was whipped across his skin again and again, overlapping cuts lighting each others nerve endings on fire at the raw feeling, his pathetic jerking against the table as his limbs bruised themselves against the restraints and his back arched and tensed-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hawks shakes the memory away as he dives out the nearest window-<em> for convenience</em>, he tells himself. He\u2019s not<em> running</em>, he has no reason to. As much as he tries to convince himself of it, every breath he pulls in gets easier as he flies away from the building behind him. Flying feels as freeing as it does painful; every wing beat pulls at his ripped skin, not even bandaged due to his sudden departure. The blood will be a bitch to get out, and he might just have to ditch the jacket all together due to all the stains currently spreading across the inside of it. Hawks shakes his head to clear it as the dull rooftop of a building comes into view, preparing himself for a rough landing (having all of his feathers, for once, doesn\u2019t stop his back from screaming as he uses the muscles to control his wings) in the middle of a roof in a bad part of town, wheezing a bit as the sudden movement rubs his wounds against the inside of his jacket. He lands roughly and barely manages to stay on one knee until the pain recedes to manageable levels again and he can breathe again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he finally collects himself off of the rough ground of the roof, Dabi is standing next to the roof access door with a carefully blank expression that somehow shows a <em>shocking</em> level of bitchy impatience at Hawks apparent tardiness for someone who <em>didn\u2019t even show</em> for the last meeting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Dabi seems to run like a city bus schedule; if you're early then you\u2019re on time, if you're on time then you\u2019re late, if you're late then you're dead. It's similar enough to a bus schedule, and shockingly similar to the Hero Public Safety Commission\u2019s schedule that Hawks had taken to it easily, despite the odd hours that it called for. Hawks mentally dubbed it Dabi Time in his head and he has yet to think of it as anything else.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pulling in a gasp of air as he attempts to stretch, Hawks winces both in pain and embarrassment as he walks over, quickly ducking inside and trying to pretend like his back isn\u2019t on fire. If he doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to whatever the pyromaniac is doing, Dabi might actually let him burn, game night truce or no. The thought doesn\u2019t bring anything but a tired weariness, and Hawks resolves to focus on anything other than that fact that death didn\u2019t sound that terrible to him at the moment. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d had a <em>building fall on him</em> while doing hero work (this time), or been <em>thrown from the sky</em> without enough feathers to fly (again), or been <em>suplexed into the ground</em> by someone with a strength quirk and <em>gotten his ribs smashed</em> (he doesn\u2019t recommend it). Those things weren\u2019t <em>great</em>, but at least then he\u2019d have the right to complain if they\u2019d happened this time. Honestly, getting punished by his Handlers was so far down the list of \u2018most painful things\u2019 that it almost didn\u2019t even count. The life of a hero almost guaranteed worse things happening every day, especially if you were as high up as he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>(And everything was fine, but he didn\u2019t even know what he did he couldn\u2019t get better- couldn\u2019t fix it if he didn\u2019t know what he did-)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trip down to the floor of the building, where he assumed the others were, was almost as excruciating as the set of holes that Dabi\u2019s eyes were burning into Hawks\u2019 back, but he didn't stop walking. Honestly, Hawks didn\u2019t even know where he was supposed to be going, it would make sense for Dabi to be leading, but he kinda figured that Dabi didn\u2019t want him at his back as much as the reverse was true. The villain, for all of their trading of witty quips and even non-hostile moments, obviously didn\u2019t like the winged hero. Which was<em> fine</em>, just really, really awkward in moments that required the smallest foundation of trust. Like this one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this point, Hawks is too tired to argue about it anyway; his back feels both more numb and even more painful with every step he forces himself to take, the bruises on his wrists and neck (thankfully mostly hidden by his hero outfit), were their own special kind of pain, and it felt like his head was being stuffed with cotton that bees had nested in. And, as nice as it was to have a fluffy inner lining when he was flying through cold air, the fluff was only catching and pulling at the mess that he was currently calling his skin. Anything that managed to scab over even slightly as quickly caught in and ripped at by the seemingly harmless fluff that he typically enjoyed the feel of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After leaving to meet for game night, Hawks had felt disconnected from his body a bit, and it'd only gotten worse and worse as time slowly crawled on. It came in waves, and it never fully took the pain away, so it was just really inconvenient and disruptive to his thought process. Especially when he's walking through an abandoned building with a certified, and <em>shockingly unrepentant</em>, murderer (who could deem him a liability at any moment and roast him) to go meet with other wanted criminals. To play<em> monopoly</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks just wanted to get the meeting over with and leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A grunt and a harsh jerk on his wing was the only clue he was given before he\u2019s steered into an empty room with Dabi right behind him. So empty in fact, that the rest of the league wasn\u2019t there, but Hawks could hear them nearby. His wings tensed in alarm as Hawks tried to figure out just what Dab was going to do; this ending in a fight was currently his main concern. The room seemed big enough, but Hawks had no doubt that adding any sort of furniture would make it seem too small, his dead body being the furniture in this case. Or maybe that was just him projecting (<em>wishing, hoping, please he didn\u2019t wanna do this anymore it hurts-</em>); his back itched and the skin felt too tight over it due to the swelling of the welts and bruises quickly growing, getting worse by the second. The floaty feeling was making it really hard to concentrate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi makes a displeased noise and levels Hawks with an annoyed look that went with it perfectly, \u201cYou were late.\u201d Hawks shrugs noncommittally in response, \u201cI was<em> busy</em>,\u201d he stresses the word playfully, meeting the villain's eyes after he examined the empty room for a stray monopoly board. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, you saved me from my busy schedule,<em> thank god</em> for game night with wanted criminals,\u201d he jokes mildly, hoping that the small joke will incite something other than rage. Dabi looks to the side, rather pointedly, at a somehow still functioning clock on the wall that read <em>just</em> past two in the morning. Which meant that Dabi was one, <em>challenging his social life</em>, and two, <em>completely aware</em> that he had shitty meeting times, he just didn\u2019t care. Sarcastically flicking his gaze between Hawks and the clock, Dabi didn\u2019t look amused as his face twisted into something colder, something that nearly made his wings shake against his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, too busy doing <em>hero\u00a0work</em>?\u201d Dabi sneers lowly, throwing a pointed look at Hawks\u2019 jacket. Hawks\u2019 fuzzy brain screams at him to also look at his jacket, but he doesn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary with it other than a sauce stain. \u201cHm, no? I came from the commission this time. You got me all to yourselves today,\u201d Hawks laughs distractedly, trying his best to keep his back as straight as possible and the floaty feeling at bay. He needed to concentrate if Dabi was going to start something, or his body really would clog up the room. Scoffing, Dabi leans closer. \u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 <em>lie</em> to me, birdie. Ya got <em>villain blood</em> on your jacket for fucks sake.\u201d Dabi was seething now, leaning forwards with his hands clenched in his pockets, and Hawks\u2019 wings began to fluff up in alarm behind him, catching Dabi\u2019s eye and receiving a harsh look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would have been threatening if everything didn\u2019t feel like it was upside down and underwater.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Hawks far too long to respond, filling the air with a thick one sided tension that he can\u2019t really focus on enough to reciprocate. \u201c...jacket?\u201d Hawks parrots cluelessly after he registers that Dabi expected a response. His hands paw at the sleeves of his jacket, shifting each one this way and that in an attempt to see what Dabi is so angry about. The only blood that could be on his jacket would be his own, and it couldn\u2019t have gotten past the thick rolls of fluff that lined the inside. He quickly double checks his sleeves before his eyes catch against the sauce stain again and he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s just <em>barbecue</em>, hot stuff.\u201d Hawks rubs at the stain absentmindedly. He sure <em>hopes</em> it\u2019s a sauce stain; if it isn\u2019t and Dabi somehow knew, it would suck. Dabi stares harder and Hawks double checks again, just to be sure. Again, nothing out of the ordinary. He\u2019s seconds from confirming his earlier words when he\u2019s interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn your <em>back</em>, dumbass,\u201d Dabi points out helpfully, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers. <em>Shit.</em> Hawks feels his mouth form a small \u2018o\u2019 as he drops his sleeve and freezes; Dabi watches on in mild despair, as if wondering how Hawks could be any stupider. At least he doesn't look like he\u2019s seconds from roasting the room and everything in it, ie Hawks. He still looks like he\u2019s a bit murdery though, like Hawks had in fact been <em>hunting villains all night</em> instead of just reporting to the Hero Public Safety Commission. Feeling the need to defend himself. Hawks quickly sputters out a half assed response, \u201cOh, <em>no</em>. No, no, no. That's uh- mine,\u201d he finishes lamely, looking away from Dabi\u2019s burning gaze to focus on his nose instead. <em>Fuckin\u2019 stupid bird, can\u2019t even keep a jacket clean.</em> Hawks feels his eyes begin to burn with tears that won\u2019t ever fall because of his stupid quirk; for once he\u2019s thankful for it, if it means not crying in front of one of Japan\u2019s most wanted, especially over something as stupid as a ruined jacket. Something shifts in Dab\u2019s expression, but Hawks is too busy trying to blink the focus back into his suddenly blurry vision to see it. A pause. \u201cThat's a lotta blood for <em>one person</em>, pretty bird,\u201d the villain mutters skeptically. He might have said something else but Hawks is, once again, feeling like he could sink through the floor at his feet in both dizziness and despair at the situation. Nothing feels real at that moment, and it\u2019s so odd, especially when compared to everything usually being too much for him all the time. It feels like crashing from a high, or like trying to live in a syrup bottle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks still can\u2019t see very well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks blinks away the tears and Dabi is a little closer than before. Another pause, this one far longer and far more awkward than the first one, stretches between the shortened distance. Finally, Dabi sighs and begins stomping forward to tug at the bird hero\u2019s jacket, \u201cshow me,\u201d he demands roughly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks feels like the air had been sucked from the room as the tugging pulls the blood matted jacket fluff from his wounds, exhaling harshly and nearly falling backwards as he jerks to get away. Fight or Flight kicks in, and even though he\u2019s a bird of prey, Dabi might as well be a <em>hunter</em> in that moment for all of the good that it does him and his stupid animal brain. His wings give a few panicked, uncoordinated flaps that only make the pulling skin <em>worse</em>, but they give him the momentum he needs to separate himself from a heavily scowling Dabi. He quickly chirps out a little, \u201cI\u2019m fine, all good,\u201d before taking a few more steps back to create a larger distance between them. Dabi simply stalks towards him again, taking two steps forward for every one step Hawks takes back. He looks more murderous than usual, and Hawks begins using his wings to propel himself backwards, no matter how much his back burns at the frantic movements. It\u2019s all a haze of pain and mild panic in his brain, a game of cat and mouse, up until Hawks, who had not been focusing on anything but creating distance between himself and a lethal threat, slams himself <em>back first into a wall.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sudden burst of pain causes his vision to grey out and his knees to buckle, and he distantly hears a pained shriek. It\u2019s absolute <em>agony</em>, and if the room had felt empty of air before, now air might as well have never been there in the first place. He crumbles onto his hands and knees <em>(not his back, thank god for the small mercies of life)</em> before his body lists sideways and his ribs hit the unforgiving concrete below him. It jostles his back and he lets out a small whine that only gets bigger when he feels hands tugging at his jacket again. The frantic and painful tugging is coupled with muttered curses and harsh shoves against Hawks\u2019 wildly flapping wings as he lays there in a useless heap. After numerous tugs that have Hawks gasping into the dusty ground, a heat that has nothing to do with swelling and more to do with fire flashes in and out of existence so fast that Hawks wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if it hadn\u2019t somehow taken his jacket with it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world, if not for his own gasping and the thumps of his wings against the wall and ground, would have been dropped into harsh silence. His jacket being gone, burned his frantic but tired mind supplies, sucks but he quickly makes peace with it. It actually helps with the pain; the lack of jacket fluff clinging and ripping free with every breath is a huge relief. And it isn\u2019t like he was left with nothing; his halter top still covers the base of his back and it still clings to his torso and halfway down his arms. Hawks can actually take in stuttering breaths up until fingers prod his back and he arches away with a frightened and pained squawk, the sudden movement tearing at his skin once more. The fingers retreat quickly after that and a low buzzing set in, occasionally broken up with more buzzing that he can faintly call curses. He\u2019s so far gone into a daze that when a hand grabs his chin roughly and jerks his face up he only chirps slightly in a dazed sort of alarm, not even really seeing what\u2019s in front of him. A sudden increase in the buzzing causes him to twitch slightly, and the new pitches hurt his ears when they mix together to form an uneven monster of a noise. Simply deciding to close his eyes, both to hide from the buzzing and to stop the room from spinning, Hawks lets out a small puff of a breath into the floor. Seconds later, something taps his face hard enough for his eyes to flash open as he startles a bit. Dabi\u2019s face enters his view, eyebrows pinched and mouth moving before he scowls and retreats. Air is slowly returning to the room as he lays there with nothing touching his back, clearing his head of the fog that had filled it. Soon enough, Dabi\u2019s looking down at him again with an unhappy expression and a hard glint to his eyes. It\u2019s almost funny, how even in this weird place where nothing really felt real, Dabi looked angry. The humor lasts about as long as Dabi forcing his body into a fireman's carry does. There are flashes of the other league members, and Hawks <em>barely</em> remembers to ask what he had done<em> wrong</em>, because if he was bad and about to be punished he should really <em>remember</em>- But then his world tips dangerously as Dabi rounds a corner and suddenly he can\u2019t really focus on words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After that, things faded scarily fast into nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Hawks wakes up, in extreme pain, to someone manhandling him onto a table, stomach down. His immediate response is to jerk away, but when he attempts it the skin over his back is pulled harshly and several sets of hands snag his bruised wrists. However, the person manhandling him drops their hold with a surprised curse. Hawks nearly eats shit against the corner of the table, barely catching himself with the help of the other hands, and his back is screaming at him, but he\u2019s standing almost on his own and nobody\u2019s really grabbing him anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hooray for small victories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The small victory is short lived as he\u2019s hauled fully onto the table anyway and his automatic thrashing is quickly subdued by bruising holds on his limbs. He still jerks and bucks, but he can\u2019t do much and everything hurts anyway and he doesn\u2019t know what he did wrong and for all his pleading they still won\u2019t tell him, <em>not even his handler</em>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then suddenly he doesn\u2019t really exist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not<em> great</em>, but Hawks can recognize it when he checks out of his body like it's a cheap hotel room; he can feel himself go limp, his breaths evening out, his eyelids falling halfway shut as his heart rate slows. \u00a0He watches from outside his own body as he his back is taken care of, bandaged oh so carefully, like the league of villains actually gives a fuck. The bruises are poked at with gentle fingers, but apparently it's decided that there's nothing that can be done for them. His body is loose and ready for pain, which is probably why it tenses as the hands leave him and suddenly small fingers dive into his hair, larger ones into his wings, and four fingers simply rest on the inside of his left wrist, where the bruising is arguably worse. After several moments of what seems to be poorly timed grooming, Hawks is feeling himself sink rapidly back into his body, trying to quell shivers at the unnaturally gentle touches. If the way that the petting slowly stops is any indication, he doesn\u2019t really do a good job. <em>Fuck</em>. Fingers clench in the feathers of his left wing as he tries to throw himself off of the table, causing him to not get as far and slam his hip into it so hard that his leg goes numb, and he doesn\u2019t get far before he\u2019s dragged back. This time he stays put.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fingers grip the edge of the table so hard that his knuckles turn white, but Hawks flat out refuses to break eye-contact with Dabi, who looks equal parts annoyed and relieved to see him on the fucking table. Hawks just levels him with a blank stare before slowly pushing himself up and sitting, still on the table. The rest of the league seems ready to restrain him at any point, like he\u2019s a flight risk. Jokes on them, Hawks isn\u2019t sure that he could fly without fucking up his back even more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck <em>happened</em>, Hawks?\u201d Shigaraki asks tiredly, sounding like he\u2019s simply out of fucks to give and he forgot to get more from the store.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you believe me if I said zip-lining?\u201d Hawks quips, taking advantage of his distraction and sliding off of the table, being careful not to strain his back too badly. The flight home, if he could even manage to get himself off the ground, was going to <em>suck</em>. Shigaraki scoffs at his answer, looking ready to dust him then and there out of the sheer convenience of never having to deal with this shit again. Spinner leans towards him, looking ready to help at a moment's notice, a movement that Twice copies on his other side. As if Hawks was going to collapse like a swooning maiden or an elderly man on a frozen pond. Jerkily waving his hand in a dismissive gesture, the hero begins his slow inching towards the door, throwing an easy smile at the others in the room. \u201cI mean, have you guys seen those things, they\u2019re <em>death traps</em> man-\u201d Spinner stops him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho got you, Hawks? Surely if you were missing\u00a0 for too long we would have known.\u201d He sounds so reasonable, and <em>just</em> concerned enough that Hawks almost spits it out, almost makes up some lie about being captured just so he doesn\u2019t have to explain that he\u2019d<em> deserved it</em>. But everyone is <em>looking</em> at him, and his proud posture wilts, his wings curling around his shoulders in an effort to hide him as he stops his slow trip to what he assumes is a door that leads outside. This job depends on a lot of <em>trust</em>; if Hawks can\u2019t even admit why he was <em>bleeding out from his back</em>, then he can\u2019t expect to be trusted, or to be let in on <em>actual meetings</em>. Honestly, at this point the only thing holding him back is his own selfish pride, and good heroes- good <em>people</em>, even- aren\u2019t supposed to have that. So he sighs, and repeats what he\u2019d told Dabi when he\u2019d first asked,</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was at the Hero Public Safety Commission due to a <em>stupid mistake</em> I made-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u00a0<em>missing</em> at all then!\u201d Toga interrupts, looking like she caught him doing something incriminating. Twice immediately launches into an argument about interrupting people or something. Hawks isn\u2019t sure what they're going on about, but as long as he doesn\u2019t have to actually explain anything more, he\u2019s fine with being talked over. Spinner and Shigaraki are watching the debate like a tennis match, looking anxious and annoyed respectively. Dabi seems to have decided that nothing is worth his time and just left. Only Kurogiri is still looking at Hawks, who can\u2019t bring himself to make eye contact. \u201cFinish speaking,\u201d he coaxes softly. Hawks glances around and sees that everyone else was still sucked into either debating or spectating said debate. So he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was- I don\u2019t even know,<em> careless</em>? I had to be, uh,\u201d Hawks shifts his hands through the air as if grasping for the right word,\u201d-punished,\u201d he finishes weakly, having a stare-down with the floor. Kurogiri seems to quietly mull this over. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the<em> type</em> to be careless-\u201d and Hawks wants to cry in <em>relief</em> that that's what the other decided to focus on. Not the fact that he was bad enough to need correction, not that the correction has happened <em>at all</em>. Just a mild refutation is the best thing that could have come out of this. Everything crashes and burns half a second later, when Dabi suddenly appears two feet from his face, like a <em>goddamned ghost here to fuck him over.</em></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he fuckin\u2019 <em>isn\u2019t</em>,\u201d Dabi growls out. There\u2019s fire in the villain\u2019s eyes as he just glowers broodingly at Hawks, and the hero can\u2019t even look away because he\u2019s, like, <em>almost positive</em> that Dabi knows too much, like he somehow heard more than what Hawks actually said. The debate had apparently ended, and now everyone\u2019s staring at him with emotions ranging from confusion to anger, and he doesn\u2019t really know what to say. Dabi\u2019s mouth drops open again, and Hawks can\u2019t let <em>that</em> happen, so he pushes onward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even <em>remember</em> why, okay?\u201d Hawks defends, turning his gaze away to look at a far wall. \u201cIt just helps me get<em> better</em>-\u201d. And all at once, everyone explodes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>, Hawks-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that even <em>mean</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks takes baby steps backwards, getting closer and closer to the door, as everyone continues to get loud and look at each other for answers. Well, almost everybody; Dabi is watching him limp away with an unimpressed expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are torture wounds,\u201d Shigaraki points out, crossing his arms and leveling Hawks with a dead-eyed stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do <em>you</em> even know what torture wounds look like?\u201d Hawks mindlessly throws back as he continues to plan his escape. Shigaraki looks at him with raised eyebrows until Hawks looks away again, feeling like an idiot. These people are villains, he knows that (<em>but its so easy to forget-</em>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks flicks him a two fingered salute before turning tail like the coward he feels like and making for the door. He doesn't get more than four feet before Dabi grabs him by one of his wings and yanks him back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit the <em>fuck</em> down, hero,\u201d growls Dabi as he all but drags Hawks back int the main part of the room. It\u2019s almost like being put on display, or up for auction; everyone, including Toga, is just\u2026 <em>staring</em> at him. His voice itches to crack jokes about his looks and flash photography, but the frown on Twice\u2019s face is kinda stopping that train before it leaves the station. The mood of the room has dropped drastically, going from tense to almost... <em>sad</em> in a soft way. Hawks doesn\u2019t really understand it when Toga quickly pulls him to her, not being as careful as she should be with his back but he can appreciate the effort. He still lacks that same understanding when Twice joins the hug, arguing to himself too low for Hawks to hear; it's something about Hawks being too thin, and that being rude to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Honestly, it wasn't the first time someone had said it, but Hawks was never quite sure how to explain that he needs food that the commission says he doesn't. The stuff they feed him is normal for people without a predatory bird quirk, and it makes him sick if he has too much. He convinces himself that it's the reason that he's so fast.)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It almost feels like he\u2019s drowning all over again. He hadn't even done anything to <em>deserve</em> the affection, the concern, and it was slowly taking his world apart because <em>nothing</em> was given for free, not to him. When he manages to pull himself together enough to not just stare blankly over the shoulders in his vision, his eyes find Kurogiri, who looks at him consideringly before deciding, \u201cYou\u2019re remarkably similar to us, Hawks.\u201d And Hawks, a <em>hero</em>, raised with <em>every opportunity that he could hope to have</em>, <em>fed regularly, saves people</em>, Hawks-\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, he doesn\u2019t feel like that assessment is wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the jerky nod Dabi gives, Spinner\u2019s little smile, and the slightly less creepy stare he gets from Shigaraki, they seem to agree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The villain sandwich he\u2019s found himself in has become less of a hug and more of a hold; and Hawks can\u2019t actually remember the last time he was just <em>held</em>. So he allows his eyes to slide shut, allows himself to raise his hands and clutch at the two who only hold on together. He tries not to enjoy it<em> too much</em>, lest he get too used to it- but it can\u2019t hurt to enjoy it while it lasts. He may never get this again, and he wonders briefly what will happen after he lets go. As luck would have it, and because Dabi apparently has a <em>radar</em> for this kind of thing, the moment is ruined a few short breathes later when the flame villain demands for an explanation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Hawks, despite all his training not to, <em>shatters</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so he tells them;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tells them about saving people from a car crash and getting sold to the commission for it. He tells them about how he learned not to cry in the first week. He tells them about the cosmetic surgery, about the weeks spent in agony while training on new feet, about how often he forgets his own name, how it was legally changed. He admits to years of everything being kept from him, of being harshly punished, of the leering stares, of the constant threats for more cosmetic surgery held over his head like a guillotine\u2019s blade-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he feels both like he\u2019s free and like he\u2019s only fulfilling the tale of Icarus when he tells them he\u2019s a spy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi just snorts while Kurogiri solemnly nods, \u201cwe know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks feels his eyes grow wide, his breath stuttering in his chest, \u201cyou <em>knew</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi looks at him incredulously, \u201cof course we <em>knew</em>. Why the <em>fuck else</em> would you only be invited to Monopoly night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Hawks can choke out a laugh, but that\u2019s the last of his air. He starts falling apart for the second time in ten minutes, his wings shake harshly as they curl over him, and Dabi looks at him like he\u2019s crazy before mild panic coupled with realization slides over his face and he reaches out. Hawks is shaking against a wall twenty feet away between one second and the next, and he\u2019s sliding down it because he can\u2019t keep his knees strong enough to support him. He knows he looks pathetic, hell, he <em>feels</em> pathetic- but that doesn\u2019t change anything. He\u2019s <em>failed</em> his mission, his cover is <em>blown</em>, and he\u2019s probably going to <em>die</em> here where nobody will find his body for <em>weeks</em>- maybe even <em>months</em>. He\u2019s curled against the wall, his side pressed to it and his feathers aren't obeying his desperate attempts to get them to respond, to get rid of the threats in the room because <em>they\u2019re going to kill him, and even if he gets away he\u2019s dead-</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The commission has no use for disobedient heroes who blow their own cover.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hand reaches past his feather walls and his stupid bird brain just grabs it tightly, latching on to something that\u2019s going to kill him like it will be what saves him. He clutches at it like a lifeline, and it barely keeps him just floating away. Everything is too bright, too loud, too <em>fucking</em> much right now- Hawks can feel a high whine coming from his throat, and can barely hear a low voice telling people to, \u201cleave, get the fuck out,\u201d as shoes shift against the floor next to him. The voice sends vibrations against his sensitive feathers, each one a raw nerve ending, and the tears build up in his useless eyes again at the stimulation. It doesn\u2019t hurt, and that makes him untense bit by bit, but it still feels far too rough. The skin under his gloveless (when had they been taken<em> off-</em>) fingertips is rough, and probably being stabbed into with his sharp nails hard enough to make most people jerk their hands back or try to pry him off. But this hand, and the wrist attached to it, doesn\u2019t jerk or pull. It just allows Hawks to hold it, and it\u2019s the only thing that can hold his focus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so he\u2019s left here, staring at harsh purple scars that are held to the healthy skin with shiny staples that still glint in the limited light of his wings. Minutes or hours could be passing, he doesn't know. Time feels irrelevant and fluid. Something brushes against his left wing, straightening the ruffled feathers, and Hawks can only gasp and lean into the offered comfort. He begins to count time passed according to the rate of fingers running through his feathers, and having that control helps. When Hawks can uncurl himself enough, he sees Dabi, crouched next to him and carding his free hand through the messy red feathers that cover his wing that isn\u2019t currently trapped against the wall. Dabi peers at him through the small crack in his defenses and hums, \u201chey there, pretty bird.\u201d Hawks chokes on another laugh at the nickname, but this time his lungs are able to refill afterwards and he just <em>breathes</em>. It\u2019s fine; it doesn\u2019t look like Dabi really minds his lack of response as he continues to let Hawks hold his wrist. His eyes never leave the calm teal of Dabi\u2019s as he\u2019s slowly brought out of his wings, just as Dabi\u2019s hand never strays from his wing. Soon enough, he feels okay enough to slowly attempt to relax his grip, to force himself to let go, and huffs a breath of relief when his fingers stiffly follow his directions. Dabi takes his, now free, hand and <em>immediately</em> shoves it into the feathers of Hawks\u2019 other wing, which requires some shifting but when they finally manage it Hawks very nearly <em>chirps</em>. He\u2019s never had anyone take care of his wings without reason; sometimes, if he had to go somewhere important, the Commission would do it, but it was always harsh and they used hairspray to keep them looking nice. Brushing hairspray out of his feathers took hours every time it happened, and it <em>hurt</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when Dabi just stays there, slowly tracing the bones of his wings and just <em>preening</em> him, it feels so nice that it\u2019s almost<em> unreal.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the first little chirp makes it past his lips, Hawks doesn\u2019t even notice at first. It's only after Dabi\u2019s pause that he flushes with embarrassment. He feels his face burn as he just stares at the ground in front of him, and he can feel Dabi\u2019s stare on the back of his head as he asks, \u201cyou <em>chirp</em>?\u201d He stresses the word, like he can\u2019t believe what he heard, and when Hawks chances a glance over his shoulder Dabi meets his eyes and his face is <em>priceless</em>. Hawks, feeling a lot better now, lets out a slow and obviously sarcastic<em> chirp</em> in response. Dabi retaliates by pulling him further from the wall and carding his hands through the feathers again. The closer he gets to where the wings connect to Hawks\u2019 back, the more frequent the chirps get, which Dabi quickly realizes and\u00a0<em>immediately exploits</em> to his best ability.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Dabi removes his hands, Hawks feels like a puddle of hollow bones and fluffy feathers. He groans in protest when Dabi hauls them both up from the ground, his stiff legs wanting to give out but reluctantly supporting his weight. Dabi hands him his halter top, and he pulls it on over the bandages that wrap around his chest, for once unconcerned with how it might look. A hand snags his wrist as he goes to leave, and his breath catches when Dabi calls out, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going.\u201d It\u2019s not even a question, just a gentle reprimand, and Hawks feels himself relax again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apartment?\u201d He tries, cringing at the look Dabi throws his way. \u201cWe live <em>here</em>.\u201d It\u2019s an offer as much as it is just a flippant reminder, and Hawks isn\u2019t really sure what he\u2019s supposed to<em> do</em> with the information. His cluelessness must show on his face, because Dabi just rolls his eyes and starts walking to a different door with Hawks slowly following behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s <em>no way</em> this is your base,\u201d Hawks defends, hoping that he doesn\u2019t sound as lost to the villain as he does to his own ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dabi concedes, not turning around and not stopping his long strides, \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A shit-eating grin spreads on his face as he turns and leans in, \u201c<em>the base is next door</em>.\u201d And Hawks can feel the way his jaw drops in disbelief. Dabi stretches like a cat, looking pleased, before gesturing for Hawks to follow him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the family, birdie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
