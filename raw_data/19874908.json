And I'd be nowhere without Lynnmonster and her ability to turn around a beta so quickly.

  "text": "<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Aziraphale actually surprised the Hell out of him, the first time. It was way back in dusty Mesopotamia, and they had been sharing a jug of something alcoholic\u2014not great, but the best available. It was, Crowley remembered, a string of very hot days, and he was idly thinking about curling up somewhere dark and quiet in serpent form and having a nap. </p>\n<p>That he was eyeing the hem of Aziraphale\u2019s robe for this purpose was neither here nor there. </p>\n<p>In any case\u2014they were minding their own business in a public house, drinking steadily but not immoderately, when a man walked in. </p>\n<p>The mortal reeked of Heaven\u2019s favor, which made Crowley want to sneeze, except he\u2019d never gotten the hang of sneezing. And Aziraphale\u2014</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked very much as though he\u2019d like to crawl under the hem of <i>Crowley\u2019s</i> robe and just not come out. </p>\n<p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Crowley murmured solicitously. </p>\n<p>\u201dNo,\u201d Aziraphale lied poorly.</p>\n<p>Crowley took a close look at the man in question, the kind of close look only an angel or a demon could take. He snorted. \u201cThat was a fire that didn\u2019t need any kindling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have my orders,\u201d Aziraphale said with a pinched look on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re coming this way,\u201d Crowley said dryly. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s expression turned desperate, and all right\u2014even then, Crowley had been weak to the slightest suggestion that he might in some way give Aziraphale what he needed. </p>\n<p>Still\u2014he hadn\u2019t expected a sudden lapful of angel. </p>\n<p>\u201cVery sorry about this,\u201d Aziraphale said, and kissed him.</p>\n<p>Crowley had kissed before; out of idle curiosity, for the most part. He tempted humans to lust when he had to, but he preferred not to be personally involved in any of the fallout. To be perfectly honest, humans mostly lusted all by themselves, no demonic assistance necessary, and when it came right down to it, he couldn\u2019t see what was wrong with using their bodies as they were made. It was all right there in the design, wasn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>And speaking of design, Aziraphale\u2019s lips were soft and plush and so very sweet.</p>\n<p>So, too, was his bottom, which Crowley had grabbed reflexively to steady him when he swung himself into Crowley\u2019s lap. Crowley didn\u2019t exactly mean to help himself to a little exploratory squeeze, but he did get a little caught up in the moment.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale squeaked in surprise, but he didn\u2019t remove himself from Crowley\u2019s embrace. Instead, he stopped kissing Crowley long enough to murmur in his ear, \u201cIs he still there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill there,\u201d Crowley confirmed, and pressed a kiss to the curve of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw. \u201cMy, my, angel, he looks ever so disappointed. What did you <i>do</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you that kind of information,\u201d Aziraphale said primly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Crowley said, who honestly didn\u2019t care about the specifics of Aziraphale\u2019s orders, except when they directly opposed his own. He flicked his still-a-bit-forked tongue at Aziraphale\u2019s earlobe, and Aziraphale shuddered deliciously in his arms. \u201cShall I rescue you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s overstating it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I am,\u201d Crowley said, and then nibbled a bit at the underside of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw. \u201cAn attachment like that\u2014why, anyone might think he\u2019d had a taste of divine ecstasy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale went still in his arms, and Crowley smiled against his throat. \u201cMade it a bit too spicy, didn\u2019t you. And now he wants a second helping, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Aziraphale muttered, a touch sulky.</p>\n<p>Crowley looked over Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder at the man, who was starting to look a little murderous for Crowley\u2019s taste. \u201cWell, angel, there\u2019s a shortage of perfect bottoms in this world. It would be a shame if he discorporated yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale said immediately, and then went charmingly pink in the cheeks. \u201cPerfect?\u201d</p>\n<p>That was when the man started to make his advance toward their table, and Crowley said, \u201cCome on, up, time to go!\u201d because yes, that was a knife.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale scrambled off his lap. \u201cDo something!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Crowley said. He grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s hand and tugged him out the back, and they ran through several alleys and a few courtyards.</p>\n<p>They stopped when Crowley judged them safe enough, and Aziraphale panted for breath. \u201cAll the powers at your disposal, and your plan was to <i>run away</i>?\u201d he said, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Crowley said. \u201cFlashier stuff draws the wrong kind of attention, and I got the impression you wanted to avoid that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale patted his hair ineffectually. \u201cOh. Well. Yes, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean you\u2019d hardly have climbed into my lap otherwise,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite right,\u201d Aziraphale said, and what a magnificently terrible <i>liar</i> he was.</p>\n<p>Crowley scratched the back of his head. \u201cWell. See you around, I suppose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Aziraphale said, sounding delightfully put out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you that kind of information,\u201d Crowley parroted back to him.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s beautiful lips curved into a genuine pout that was definitely not at all angelic. \u201cFine,\u201d he bit out.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to bid me farewell?\u201d Crowley asked, leaning down a bit and cocking one eyebrow suggestively.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale glared at him. \u201cTry not to get stepped on by a mule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCold, angel,\u201d Crowley said. Let Aziraphale see you almost get discorporated in serpent form once and he never let you forget it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019m grateful for the assistance,\u201d Aziraphale said, and then he kissed Crowley on the cheek, as people did in this land when taking their leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cLater, then,\u201d Crowley said, and sauntered away without looking back. He might have even whistled a bit\u2014poorly, though, because he was a demon, after all.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>In Rome, they ran into each other at the same orgy. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Aziraphale asked under his breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cSame thing as you, I\u2019d wager,\u201d Crowley said, equally low. </p>\n<p>\u201cI very much doubt that,\u201d Aziraphale sniffed. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>work</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not here for my own enjoyment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s expression melted into commiseration. \u201cIt is all a bit much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>They surveyed the scene around them. Aziraphale had a gift for understatement. </p>\n<p>Crowley took a large swallow of wine from his goblet. \u201cYou know the most annoying part?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe snails are under seasoned,\u201d Aziraphale said with a glum sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014well, yes,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBut I meant\u2014you\u2019re just here to do your bloody job and people won\u2019t leave you <i>alone</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were already plenty of people eyeing them speculatively, and Aziraphale could be gullible but he wasn\u2019t an idiot. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is inconvenient,\u201d he allowed cautiously. </p>\n<p>\u201cBe much easier to do what we came here to do if they all thought we were spoken for, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley nodded at a wide reclining couch that was miraculously unoccupied and not overly close to any of the proceedings going on around them. \u201cWe take up residence there, and get\u2014comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale took one last look around the room, before evidently deciding to make the best of a shitty situation. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>There were servant boys to fetch refreshments; Aziraphale sent them off with a very specific list of requests. Crowley just asked for an entire jug of wine. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow shall we...\u201d Aziraphale trailed off, looking at the couch. </p>\n<p>\u201cGet comfortable, angel,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale sat down, back ramrod straight, and Crowley sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cLie back,\u201d he coaxed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up all the room,\u201d Aziraphale said, his nose wrinkled in concern. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just relax.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale finally reclined against the cushions on his side, still propped upright enough to eat and drink comfortably.</p>\n<p>Crowley pressed close behind him, and draped himself over Aziraphale as though he still wore a serpent's skin, twined around Aziraphale\u2019s soft body in a way that should convey to onlookers that the angel was decidedly Not Available. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Aziraphale asked in a whisper. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, exceedingly,\u201d Crowley said. </p>\n<p>The servants returned with snacks for Aziraphale and the promised jug of wine. He had no idea what Aziraphale was here to do, but he evidently wasn\u2019t in any hurry. He picked at cheese, pheasant, goose liver, and caviar-stuffed shellfish, and helped Crowley make considerable inroads on the wine. Crowley stole bites of the roasted peacock, which was an incredibly stupid bird that he was only too happy to eat.</p>\n<p>The orgy\u2014progressed, and there was still no sign of the man Crowley was to tempt, although he had his suspicions that any guest at a party like this didn\u2019t need all that much tempting, but apparently it was a political thing. Wretchedly boring, Crowley thought. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t like the way that trio across the way was looking at Aziraphale, all hungry and covetous. Crowley approved of coveting in general, but in this specific case, he didn\u2019t care for it one bit. </p>\n<p>The worst part was: that trio could definitely make things very annoying for them both if they propositioned Aziraphale and he declined. \u201cAngel,\u201d he murmured in Aziraphale\u2019s ear. \u201cYou see those men, off to your right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said, equally quietly. And then, very calmly, he said, \u201cI\u2019d be much obliged if you could slip your hand under my toga, if that\u2019s not too much of an imposition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Crowley said in kind, and without breaking eye contact with the prospective interlopers, he worked his way under the voluminous folds of cloth to Aziraphale\u2019s tunic, to where his cock would be if he cared to manifest such a thing\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you full of surprises,\u201d Crowley said admiringly. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s cheeks went pink. \u201cIt\u2019s the fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d Crowley said. He was sporting one himself. \u201cHow good of an actor are you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an angel, I\u2019m not made to deceive,\u201d Aziraphale had the nerve to say, as if he didn\u2019t whenever it suited him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky for you, I am,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust\u2014close your eyes and sigh a bit, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The toga covered a multitude of sins, including Crowley moving his hand in a very distinctive way without actually touching Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes were obediently closed, and he sighed softly, like he did when some food or drink particularly delighted him.</p>\n<p>It was very distracting, and it wasn\u2019t long before Crowley\u2019s very fashionable cock took notice. It didn\u2019t help that Aziraphale was shifting against him, and he ought to have known the angel\u2019s plump bottom was going to continue to vex him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Aziraphale murmured, after another soft roll of his hips\u2014he <i>had</i> to be feeling the effect he was having on Crowley\u2014 \u201cI do enjoy a spot of this from time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith who?\u201d Crowley demanded without thinking, and then winced.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes opened, and he tilted his head back toward Crowley. \u201cMyself, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s hand slipped, and\u2014oh. Aziraphale was apparently not indifferent.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t onanism a sin?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can hardly be said that I\u2019m being wasteful\u2014this body wasn\u2019t intended to make new life, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a solid point. A solid point that involved him imagining Aziraphale in the pale morning light, flushed and gasping.</p>\n<p>He happened to look up just then, and oh Hell\u2014there was the fellow he was meant to tempt.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Aziraphale gasped, and Crowley was about to apologize for where his hand was still resting when Aziraphale said, \u201cMy dear, so sorry, but that\u2019s the man that I\u2019m supposed to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley narrowed his eyes. \u201cWait. That man over there? The one with the limp?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe emperor\u2019s uncle Claudius, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what are you supposed to get him to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you must know,\u201d Aziraphale said, \u201che\u2019s to become emperor and usher in a new era of judicial law and public works.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what are you supposed to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConvince him to conspire with the Praetorian Guard and various senators to assassinate his nephew and take the throne.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuppose we ought to just get this over with. Want me to wave him over?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re like this?\u201d Aziraphale looked flushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI\u2019m the envy of the room right now, angel.\u201d And he was\u2014he could feel the eyes on them, and though there were more explicit acts currently happening and infinitely more nudity elsewhere at the party, he wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone, not for anything. \u201cUnless you think you\u2019d be too distracted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do my job,\u201d Aziraphale protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sssure?\u201d Crowley said. \u201cBe glad to\u2014help you out. If you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked at him, and oh, his lips were pink and Crowley just wanted a taste\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHonorable countrymen,\u201d came a mild voice, and they looked to see Claudius standing in front of them.</p>\n<p>It was the first time Crowley was cockblocked, and he couldn\u2019t say he cared for it, not one bit.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley was glad to be out of the Black Knight\u2019s armor, which was heavy, uncomfortable, and made him smell bad. Much better to be in a wealthy noblewoman\u2019s dress, especially when one\u2019s assignment was to infiltrate a nunnery.</p>\n<p>It looked pretty good on him, if he did say so himself. Slinky, the belt placed just so around his hips.</p>\n<p>The abbess greeted him in the courtyard, and exclaimed her pleasure at the tithings he brought, and invited him to stay in prayerful contemplation as long as he wished.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo generous,\u201d Crowley murmured, and allowed himself to be shown to his room. He didn\u2019t miss all manner of nuns watching his hips sway as he went.</p>\n<p>He had a short nap, because traveling annoyed him and horses annoyed him more, and when he woke, he decided to explore the nunnery. He kept well away from the consecrated grounds of the chapel; the abbess would not expect him to attend services, on account of his professed desire for solitary prayer and, more to the point, all the coins she would discover in the tithings he brought.</p>\n<p>In a beautiful room with large, stained glass windows, he was surprised to find Aziraphale, commending a few novices on their work with illuminated manuscripts.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely beautiful, Sister Eleanor,\u201d Aziraphale said warmly. In the warm golden light of the afternoon, the undyed wool of his habit looked softer and more luxurious than it was probably supposed to be. The soft leather belt around his waist was simple enough, but the way it cinched the cloth left little to the imagination where his bosom was concerned.</p>\n<p>If Crowley had been there just to inflame some novice nuns\u2019 ardor, he might have turned around and gone home, because clearly Aziraphale had that all very well in hand, whether he knew it or not.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked up, and Crowley waggled the fingers of one hand in hello. Aziraphale\u2019s expression went from surprise, to bafflement, made a stop at annoyance, and then landed on something soft and warm that made the novice nuns think very strongly about sketching the beatific curve of Aziraphale\u2019s lips in the margins of their manuscripts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Aziraphale said. Then he turned his attention back to the novices. \u201cKeep up the good work\u2014I\u2019ll be back momentarily.\u201d He followed Crowley out into the hallway before he whispered, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shrugged one shoulder. \u201cYou know, the usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale heaved an irritated sigh. \u201cCould you do it elsewhere? I\u2019m very fond of these ladies and their illuminations are becoming ever so good, and the abbess is quite a collector of manuscripts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, relax,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to ruffle your nest. I\u2019m just here about a book.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked taken aback. \u201cA book?\u201d He peered at Crowley. \u201cPardon me, my dear, but I didn\u2019t know you had any interest\u2014of course you\u2019re welcome to stay. Is there something in particular you\u2019re interested in?\u201d His expression grew exponentially more delighted. \u201cWould you like a <i>recommendation</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley was definitely of the school of work smarter, not harder. The sooner he had what he came for, the better. He looked around to make sure no one was in earshot. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale blinked. \u201cOh,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my dear, but we don\u2019t have a copy, here\u2014I wish that we did, because I\u2019d ever so much like to read it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not in the scriptorium,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cDangerous work like that, likely to be kept somewhere a bit more secure, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>They looked at each other for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m not helping you steal a book,\u201d Aziraphale said firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said anything about stealing?\u201d Crowley said soothingly. \u201cI just want to read it, and maybe have some other people read it. You said yourself you\u2019re desperate to get your hands on it. The original copy will stay right here in the nunnery, safe and sound.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked extremely dubious, and then sighed. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, after the evening prayer\u2014we\u2019ll go search for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Sister Aziraphale, I do so look forward to it,\u201d Crowley purred.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed again. And as Crowley was about to turn and walk away, Aziraphale said, \u201cLovely dress, by the by \u2014 although that embroidery is a bit on the nose, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley waved a hand down at the enormous embroidered snake on the front of his gown. \u201cWhat, this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale snorted, and strolled back to the scriptorium.</p>\n<p>Later that night, Aziraphale came to collect him, and they went to steal\u2014 \u201cBorrow,\u201d Aziraphale insisted\u2014 a very special text.</p>\n<p>It was precisely where Crowley would have hidden it, if he were an abbess with a now-uncanonical text that encouraged women to ask questions and not take men\u2019s bullshit lying down. Aziraphale took it out of its hidey-hole with careful, reverent hands, and Crowley led the way back to the scriptorium.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you make a copy?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale puffed himself up. \u201cCan I make a copy\u2014my dear, who do you think taught everyone here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cChop chop, angel. Sooner you\u2019re finished, the sooner I\u2019m out of your wimple.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale pursed his lips, but sat down at what was undoubtedly <i>his</i> table, and readied parchment and ink. \u201cI should like to read it first,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of my process. You understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley did, in as much as he knew exactly how greedy his angel could be. But he found himself saying, \u201cRead it aloud? These eyes of mine don\u2019t mix well with the written word.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the candlelight, Aziraphale\u2019s expression softened, and he said, \u201cOh my dear, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a string of nights, Aziraphale worked by candlelight, and Crowley watched him lay ink to the page, the most exquisite illuminations coming to life under his hands. They were most definitely not supposed to be in the scriptorium after evening prayer, but though they tensed when they heard a noise, it was usually just the nunnery cats on their nightly rounds.</p>\n<p>And then one night, there were definitively footsteps, and Crowley and Aziraphale looked at each other in alarm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHide it!\u201d Crowley hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ink\u2019s still wet, it\u2019ll be ruined!\u201d Aziraphale hissed back, looking frantic.</p>\n<p>Crowley was so close to being able to walk out with what he\u2019d came here for, and he thought fast. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, and pulled Aziraphale up to standing, to another table between Aziraphale\u2019s and the door to the scriptorium. Then he pushed Aziraphale to sit on the edge, stepped between his legs, and kissed him.</p>\n<p>The footsteps slowed, and Aziraphale\u2019s mouth opened underneath his, and Crowley couldn\u2019t resist deepening the kiss. Aziraphale was even softer like this, and suddenly Crowley knew exactly how those novices felt, when they wanted to bury their face in Sister Aziraphale\u2019s bosom and never leave.</p>\n<p>There was a gasp, and not from Aziraphale, who was making little sounds of pleasure into Crowley\u2019s mouth. Move on, little nun, Crowley wanted to say, and then he realized abruptly why they were not.</p>\n<p>Well. Far be it from Crowley to deny a virgin a little show that would play behind their eyes every night after evening prayer. He grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s habit and hitched it up until he could get his hand underneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to keep up the distraction,\u201d Crowley whispered in Aziraphale\u2019s ear. \u201cMake it good, angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>You</i> make it good,\u201d Aziraphale retorted automatically under his breath, and then Crowley moved his hand to touch him at the juncture of his thighs.</p>\n<p>And fool him twice\u2014Aziraphale was again making an effort, and what a lovely one.</p>\n<p>He had thought to do just as he had in Rome\u2014simulate, without touching Aziraphale at all. But he was warm and already wet under Crowley\u2019s fingers, and there was no mistaking the buck of his hips up into Crowley\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>And then Crowley heard it \u2014 the footsteps started again, lightly, as their voyeur snuck away. Aziraphale heard it too, and they kissed until the coast seemed to be quite clear. Then Aziraphale broke for breath he didn\u2019t technically need, but it was quite flattering to Crowley\u2019s pride.</p>\n<p>He was still holding Aziraphale intimately, thumb resting against a very sensitive spot. He cleared his throat. \u201cYou, erm, still go in for a spot of this? I could\u2014if you want\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d Aziraphale moaned in his ear, and grabbed Crowley\u2019s wrist to press his hand closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d Crowley said. \u201cOne of us likes to collect books and it\u2019s not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale kissed him again, and it wasn\u2019t exactly <i>nice</i>, but it was very, very good, and he writhed under Crowley\u2019s fingers. He touched him softly at first, just getting the lay of the land, and then he set about making Aziraphale sing his praises.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gasped, and sighed, and trembled, bracing himself with one arm on the table while he wrapped the other around Crowley\u2019s shoulders, and he was a <i>vision</i>, and Crowley was going to make him glorious. He pressed two fingers inside and Aziraphale wailed, and all Crowley could do was ride Aziraphale\u2019s thigh, chasing his own pleasure even as he brought the angel his. It felt so <i>good</i>, why weren\u2019t the nuns doing this all the time\u2014</p>\n<p>Aziraphale made a helpless noise, and then he clenched tight around Crowley\u2019s fingers, and that did it, that was just what Crowley needed, to know that he\u2019d brought Aziraphale not low, but the very highest. He ground against Aziraphale\u2019s thigh and rode the waves of his own pleasure out.</p>\n<p>They both gasped for breath, and Crowley was truthfully thinking about maybe something to drink before a second round, one that would hopefully involve him sticking his head under Aziraphale\u2019s habit. But Aziraphale just made a half-hearted attempt at straightening his clothing, and then coughed delicately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can probably finish tonight,\u201d he said, looking in the direction of the nearly completed manuscript.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Crowley said. He was honestly disappointed, but they both had a job to do, after all.</p>\n<p>In the end, it didn\u2019t work out quite as Crowley had hoped\u2014he\u2019d really wanted to spread the heresy much more widely, because people could and should ask questions. But Aziraphale\u2019s beautiful illuminated manuscript fell into covetous hands, and what a waste, really. Crowley could report it as a mild success, which would have to do.</p>\n<p>He did not report that he\u2019d driven an angel of the Lord to blaspheme in his ear, but he thought about it. Quite a lot. All right, constantly.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t happen every time they met, but they did come to a tacit understanding that if a distraction was required, they were both extremely prepared to do what was necessary. </p>\n<p>Crowley tried not to dwell on it, but he was prepared to do more than that, if only Aziraphale would give him a definitive sign.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t exactly what he was looking for, but when they found themselves faced with extended assignments in Florence, with a deeply paranoid family in power, Aziraphale made him an offer that practically qualified as a temptation. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe could go as husband and wife,\u201d he suggested, looking extremely pleased with himself. </p>\n<p>Crowley stared at him in disbelief. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to get close to the lady\u2019s circle to fulfill my orders, and you require some extended time with the lord\u2019s brother, do you not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley sighed, because his assignment wasn\u2019t a one and done\u2014it was just like Hell to order him to tempt a family and influence the selection of the next Pope, like Crowley could just snap his fingers. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. And then, because his streak of self-sabotage asserted itself at the worst times, he said, \u201cNot worried Upstairs is going to check in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a mandatory staff retreat,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI\u2019m the only one exempted, on account of my duties here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley winced. \u201cBet you\u2019re glad of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am. I take joy in continuing to serve as the Almighty made me,\u201d Aziraphale said, butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. </p>\n<p>Crowley folded, of course\u2014that was inevitable. Soon after, they were in a carriage on the way to Florence. Aziraphale was in so many blessed layers that Crowley actually laughed when he tried to find space next to Aziraphale on the carriage bench.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike traveling with a meringue,\u201d he said as they wrangled the incredible poof of Aziraphale\u2019s skirts. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have standards,\u201d Aziraphale said, but he was laughing, too. \u201cOh, do you think there will be meringue in Florence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Crowley said, and there would be, even if Crowley had to start a new trend. </p>\n<p>They\u2019d taken a large shortcut, but still had a day\u2019s carriage ride ahead of them. The cream and gold brocade of Aziraphale\u2019s gown caught the sunlight, as did his hair, fastened up in a complicated arrangement of braids as was the style for married women. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cIs it my bosom? Did I do it wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour bosom is fine,\u201d Crowley croaked. And then, because he was clearly an idiot who enjoyed suffering, he looked away and said, \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly, surprised but pleased. \u201cI hoped\u2014I hoped it might meet with your approval. That we might look like we belong together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Crowley said, and he wanted it so very much. \u201cVery complementary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another few miles passed, and Crowley kept touching the wedding bands in his pocket. Finally he decided that he needed to get over himself. It was for their disguise, after all. \u201cI have something for you, angel,\u201d he mustered the courage to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it a snack?\u201d Aziraphale asked, brightening at the prospect. \u201cI am feeling a bit peckish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a snack,\u201d Crowley said. He took Aziraphale\u2019s ring out of his pocket. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be Signora Crowley, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s mouth\u2014was that cosmetics, or had it always been that pink?\u2014was open in what appeared to be shock.</p>\n<p>Crowley still held the ring out. \u201cI mean. If you want it. If you\u2019d like another design, of course I can\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale thrust out his left hand, just as square and sturdy as ever, but trembling slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t change a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s traditional for you to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley took his hand and carefully slid the ring on his finger. It knew better than to not fit absolutely perfectly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stared down at the ring on his finger. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t recall,\u201d he said, his throat dry. Under no circumstances was he going to share how long he\u2019d fussed over the design, how many times he\u2019d made and re-made the ring, until it was perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think about rings,\u201d Aziraphale said, and he looked shamefaced. \u201cShall I\u2014would you like\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one,\u201d Crowley said. He pulled it out of his pocket, and it felt like he was showing his hand far too much. He should have just let Aziraphale miracle him one into being.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo elegant,\u201d Aziraphale sighed. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave Aziraphale the ring, who nearly dropped it, and then had a bit of trouble fitting it over Crowley\u2019s knuckle until Crowley hissed at the ring to behave itself, damn it. Finally it was in place, and rather than letting Aziraphale withdraw, Crowley took his hand again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there\u2014\u201d Aziraphale stopped, and delicately cleared his throat. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something you\u2019ve forgotten?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked down at the golden serpent coiled around Aziraphale\u2019s finger. \u201cWe can have a wedding banquet for the two of us when we get to Florence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI mean, yes, that would be lovely, but. There\u2019s another tradition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley racked his brain, because four thousand years was a lot of wedding traditions, and some of them were distinctly better than others. \u201cWhich one, angel?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale wetted his lips. \u201cI believe it is customary to kiss the bride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s tradition.\u201d He put his hands on Aziraphale\u2019s waist, and tugged him closer, the damnable poof of his skirts essentially necessitating hauling Aziraphale into his lap.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale wound his arms around Crowley\u2019s neck. \u201cVery. Exceedingly traditional. Can\u2019t have a wedding without it nowadays, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDevil\u2019s in the details,\u201d Crowley said, lips hovering against Aziraphale\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo let\u2019s not bring him into it,\u201d Aziraphale said, and kissed him.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Florence was two months of wedded bliss.</p>\n<p>People spoke of the honeymoon period, but Crowley wasn\u2019t sure that applied to two supernatural beings who had known each other since the creation of the earth. And their marriage was, after all, purely in service of their respective duties.</p>\n<p>It was very difficult to remember that, in the moment.</p>\n<p>They took possession of some fashionable apartments in a fashionable part of the city, and after that, it wasn\u2019t too much terrible trouble to arrange for an introduction to the family in question. The job itself wasn\u2019t difficult\u2014mostly it was listening, and asking a few leading questions, and whispering in someone\u2019s ear the right thing at the right time.</p>\n<p>Crowley was <i>very</i> good at it; he\u2019d had, after all, a lot of practice.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t say exactly what <i>he</i> was up to, but Crowley inferred it was something to do with fertility.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelicate work,\u201d Aziraphale said, when asked how it was going. \u201cYou have to\u2014\u201d he fluttered his fingers\u2014 \u201cand well, you can\u2019t quite take your eyes off it, or you have to start over. Requires patience and focus, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever it was, it seemed to be progressing. So the work didn\u2019t appear to be an issue for either of them.</p>\n<p>It was just everything <i>else</i>.</p>\n<p>Technically they should have had servants, but the first night in Florence, Aziraphale looked over his shoulder, and said, \u201cMy dear, would you mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley preferred to miracle himself in and out of outfits, but he knew the gist of removing clothing by hand. It in no way prepared him for the experience of taking off Aziraphale\u2019s clothing, piece by piece. But he worked his way through it, slow and methodical\u2014untie this bit here, loosen those laces, unpin this part\u2014and Aziraphale\u2019s skin was revealed to him, bit by bit.</p>\n<p>Strange, that they\u2019d never done this before.</p>\n<p>When Aziraphale was down to his camicia, Crowley cleared his throat. \u201cRight, then,\u201d he said, and then looked awkwardly at the bed. \u201cI know you\u2019re not much for sleeping, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the saying? When in Rome?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d Crowley said, and then before he could think better of it, \u201cLet me take your hair down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a girl put it up before we left,\u201d Aziraphale said, frowning slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could reproduce the effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d Crowley said immediately. And then, again, aware that he was begging: \u201cLet me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale nodded his assent. Crowley touched his coiffure gently, reverently, and then began to pull out hairpins. He remembered days of sewing hair into place to secure it\u2014it was practical and went in and out of use\u2014but he remembered, too, days of pulling pins from his own hair, always finding more than he remembered putting in.</p>\n<p>When he let the braids tumble down Aziraphale\u2019s shoulders and back, the <i>sound</i> Aziraphale made\u2014such a noise of pure pleasure, and all at Crowley\u2019s hands. And when he undid the braids and began to brush Aziraphale\u2019s hair out, it reminded him of something\u2014</p>\n<p>Wings, he realized. It reminded him of grooming each other\u2019s wings, back in the early days, when they\u2019d realized they had no one but each other and were still trying to find their footing in this world. Aziraphale sat on a bench in front of him, eyes closed, and Crowley pulled the brush through his hair in a hypnotic rhythm. When it seemed like Aziraphale might actually fall asleep on the bench, Crowley put his hair in one loose plait, which was his own preference for sleeping in when his hair was long.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale then changed into a less voluminous camicia for sleeping, the fabric finer and more sheer than what he\u2019d worn under his dress. Crowley attempted to avoid looking as he changed into his own sleepwear, but it was difficult.</p>\n<p>Once settled together in bed, Crowley said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep, if you don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t mind if you read.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps tomorrow night,\u201d Aziraphale said, and snuffed out the bedside candle.</p>\n<p>The silence in the room felt stifling. Crowley stared up at the ceiling, wondering how he was supposed to sleep now.</p>\n<p>Finally, Aziraphale said quietly, \u201cMy dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there another tradition?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLoads of them, angel,\u201d Crowley said, trying to buy himself some time for his higher brain functions to re-engage.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale touched Crowley\u2019s hand softly, and bless it, he was not subtle. \u201cYou know the one I mean. I know the humans go on about it, but do you reckon virginity is all that important on one\u2019s wedding night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a real thing,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust some bollocks some men made up. Virginity is whatever you want it to be.\u201d He turned his head to look at Aziraphale. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. I was just thinking\u2014we\u2019ve never\u2014not like this, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t, actually. He could remember every time he\u2019d ever kissed Aziraphale, every time he\u2019d ever driven Aziraphale to shake apart in his arms, every time he\u2019d gasped in Aziraphale\u2019s ear and come. They\u2019d all of them been hurried, and desperate, and tinged with fear of being caught by humans or Heaven or Hell.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d never had a <i>bed</i> before.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Crowley asked, and the light from the moon was so bright as it streamed in the room, turning Aziraphale\u2019s hair to a shock of pale silver.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Aziraphale breathed.</p>\n<p>They reached for each other, and kissed as though they\u2019d never done it before, slow and careful and so tender Crowley could barely stand it. And then it wasn\u2019t enough, and Aziraphale was urging Crowley to lie on top of him, the gossamer fabric of his camicia the only thing between them. He kissed Aziraphale\u2019s neck just the way Aziraphale liked, and finally touched the curves of his frankly magnificent bosom.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Ooh</i>,\u201d Aziraphale sighed, when Crowley tugged the neckline of the camicia out of his way, so that he could put his lips to Aziraphale\u2019s skin, and kiss and lick and suck and worship him properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould spend days here,\u201d Crowley murmured against Aziraphale\u2019s breast, flicking out his tongue against the nipple.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need\u2014\u201d Aziraphale said, and pushed his hips up, and Crowley touched him, just there, the blessed camicia still in the way, and Aziraphale moaned and said, \u201cMy dear, oh please, I need\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Crowley said, and though he wanted to vanish the camicia into the ether, he settled for pulling the hem up, and settled himself again in the cradle of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, pressed against the warm, wet center of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good, not stingy at all,\u201d Aziraphale had the nerve to say as he wrapped one hand around Crowley.</p>\n<p>\u201cStingy!\u201d Crowley protested, letting Aziraphale guide him inside. \u201cWhen <i>exactly</i> have I ever left you unsatisfied?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d Aziraphale said. He was so blessedly tight around Crowley, who paused to look anxiously at his expression.</p>\n<p>Apparently, he needn\u2019t have worried, because Aziraphale looked like he was having a very good moment indeed. There was a soft smile on his lips, and then he said, \u201cWell, wasn\u2019t there that time in Barcelona\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, should I have let them discorporate you rather than letting you find your pleasure a third time\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could make it up to me,\u201d Aziraphale suggested, just a tiny bit coy.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake it up to you,\u201d Crowley muttered, outraged, and began to move his hips in a dance humans figured out way back when, and maybe it was instinctive, or maybe it was that he knew he had to keep making Aziraphale moan like that and didn\u2019t want to stop, not for anything. He only paused to work a hand between them, to touch Aziraphale as his pace grew more frantic and less steady, and Aziraphale practically shrieked and clutched at his shoulders, and Crowley pressed in, in, in, and Aziraphale went tight around him, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMy darling,\u201d Aziraphale breathed in his ear like a secret, and Crowley groaned and shuddered and spilled deep within him.</p>\n<p>Crowley stayed in him until he softened, arms wound around Aziraphale, holding him close, because there was no need to do otherwise. He could just keep Aziraphale all wrapped up, and let that whispered <i>darling</i> reverberate through him.</p>\n<p>When they separated, it was only to get comfortable and curl up close again. Aziraphale put his hand on the back of Crowley\u2019s neck and stroked his nape with gentle fingers, until Crowley melted into sleep.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley woke with this face mashed into Aziraphale\u2019s thigh. Aziraphale was sitting up against the headboard, a book in hand. His hair was an unmitigated disaster.</p>\n<p>Why, it was almost as though he\u2019d been tumbled but well the night before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can feel you smirking,\u201d Aziraphale said dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s smirking?\u201d Crowley mumbled. He rubbed his face into Aziraphale\u2019s thigh, where his camicia was still a bit rucked up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne might almost think you have something to be proud of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tell me, angel,\u201d Crowley said, and lifted the hem of the camicia to stick his head underneath.</p>\n<p>It was, Crowley felt, an excellent way to start the day. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale sat at the vanity bench for him after, and Crowley painstakingly dressed his hair. It had been awhile, but his fingers still remembered the intricacies of various braids, and he had a stupid, fanciful moment when he was done\u2014if he changed his form to a small snake, he could twine himself in his lady\u2019s hair and they could stay together the whole day that way.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale inquired, meeting his startled glance in the mirror. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Crowley said, and slid another hairpin in for want of anything else better to do.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, it was the start of a daily routine. He woke, gave Aziraphale a good seeing-to, then put up Aziraphale\u2019s hair and helped him dress. They wandered the city and saw what humans wrought with their own hands and free will: art and food and music, and all of it was wonderful. They stopped in at the family palazzo to do the bare minimum of work, before returning home. And then the next day, they did it all over again.</p>\n<p>Heads turned to watch Aziraphale as he passed; his pale blonde hair was so on trend that any number of artists asked Crowley whether his lady would be interested in sitting for a portrait. Noblemen elbowed Crowley and congratulated him on such a beautiful wife. Various others made offers and then wisely and immediately reconsidered them.</p>\n<p>Not having to hide was heady and thrilling; he bought Aziraphale jewelry, a dress, a camicia so fine it was practically transparent, and Aziraphale laughed and said, \u201cMy dear, I don\u2019t need so much!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take the melon tart back,\u201d Crowley offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty,\u201d Aziraphale said primly.</p>\n<p>There was a perfect day, when the family held a banquet in a courtyard and there was food that was definitely skirting the edge of sumptuary laws\u2014one of Crowley\u2019s better ideas, if he did say so himself\u2014and through it all, Aziraphale remained by his side. They drank wine and listened to musicians play into the evening, and when Aziraphale pulled him up to standing and said they needed to return home, merriment and laughing suggestions followed them out. They wandered slowly through the city streets, Aziraphale clinging to Crowley\u2019s arm because his shoes were ridiculous and also, he was still a bit drunk. They stopped in the plaza near their home, and ate little tarts with meringue \u2014 \u201cItalian meringue,\u201d Aziraphale sighed happily, like that was supposed to mean something to Crowley \u2014 and Crowley kissed it from the corner of his lips.</p>\n<p>And then it all ended quite abruptly when they came home one day, and there was a letter in the dead center of Aziraphale\u2019s vanity.</p>\n<p>Crowley felt his insides clench when Aziraphale picked it up. Burn it, he wanted to say, burn it, unread, but he knew Aziraphale would never.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s hands shook as he broke the seal made of literal stardust, and then he took one deep breath and opened it.</p>\n<p>Crowley watched anxiously, and Aziraphale went worryingly pale as he read.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d Crowley asked, when he could take the suspense no more.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m to go to London,\u201d he said, which wouldn\u2019t be concerning if he wasn\u2019t so clearly terrified.</p>\n<p>Crowley had no orders yet. \u201cThen we\u2019ll pack up and go,\u201d he said soothingly, approaching Aziraphale carefully as one might a spooked horse.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aziraphale said immediately. He looked like he was about to cry. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m afraid I have to go on ahead. Alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlone?\u201d Crowley repeated faintly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale bit his lip and nodded. And then he flung his arms around Crowley\u2019s neck. \u201cStay safe,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOh my dear, stay safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSafe\u2014angel, hold on, just tell me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale said, and Crowley felt hot tears drip on to his neck.</p>\n<p>And that was it, wasn\u2019t it? Aziraphale wasn\u2019t his, not really\u2014he was <i>Heaven\u2019s</i>, in all the ways that really counted.</p>\n<p>Crowley pressed a kiss to Aziraphale\u2019s temple and murmured, \u201cStay safe, yourself. Not a feather out of place, you hear me? I\u2019ll follow you soon, if I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to let go, but soon Aziraphale pulled back. \u201cCrowley,\u201d he said, and he looked as heartsick as Crowley felt, and Crowley couldn\u2019t stand it. He kissed Aziraphale for what would be the last time for a good long while, and then Aziraphale left.</p>\n<p>Crowley stared unseeing after him. And then he laid down in their marriage bed alone, and wept.</p>\n<p>The honeymoon, it seemed, was well and truly over.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>When he finally arrived in London after a lengthy detour to Spain, everything was different.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Aziraphale wanted discreet locations for meeting. Gone were the days of using any flimsy pretext to touch one another; Aziraphale didn\u2019t exactly shy away from him, but nor did he touch him even casually.</p>\n<p>There was no sign of Aziraphale\u2019s wedding ring. Crowley carried his in his pocket.</p>\n<p>But some of Aziraphale was better than no Aziraphale at all; once he\u2019d persuaded Aziraphale into formalizing their Arrangement, he thought something more might come of it. But no\u2014Aziraphale continued to hold him at arm\u2019s length, which only made Crowley that much more desperate.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t say he covered himself with dignity in the following centuries. He paid humans to keep a weather eye on Aziraphale; not that Crowley could do much in the face of the wrath of Heaven, should Aziraphale incur it as he seemed so desperately afraid, but it made him feel better to do what he could. That, in fact, was how he traced Aziraphale from London to the Bastille, and oh, he shouldn\u2019t want to save Aziraphale so much, but one look at Aziraphale\u2019s pleased expression, one look at Aziraphale in his fancy clothes, and he knew he was a lost cause.</p>\n<p>But they didn\u2019t talk about Florence, not even obliquely, until they encountered one another by chance at a soiree during the Regency.</p>\n<p>Crowley was wearing widow\u2019s weeds and what he thought was a very fetching netted half-veil; it appealed to him to make everyone around him uncomfortable as they contemplated mortality, and also jealous, because he looked very good. He was also getting so much judgement from everyone around him; a person in mourning was customarily not out socially. Not bad work for just standing around at a party.</p>\n<p>He was making conversation with a young lady who distinctly did not want to be at the ball. He turned their lemonade to something a great deal more alcoholic, because it seemed the only way for both of them to cope. And then he looked over her shoulder and saw Aziraphale, who brightened to see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Mowbray,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cMay I introduce Mr. Fell?\u201d</p>\n<p>They exchanged courtesies, and Aziraphale stood there, twisting his hands somewhat awkwardly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you acquainted with one another?\u201d Miss Mowbray asked, obviously dying for something to cut the tension between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Fell was very close to my late husband,\u201d Crowley said, and smiled just a little meanly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s expression crumpled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must miss him,\u201d Miss Mowbray said quietly.</p>\n<p>And then Crowley didn\u2019t have it in him to be any more cruel. \u201cEvery day,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes welled up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were so happy,\u201d Crowley said, wistfulness and yearning suffusing him in equal measure.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were,\u201d Aziraphale said hoarsely, so plainly affected that Crowley felt like a heel for thinking he hadn\u2019t cared, that Crowley was the only one who had suffered in the wake of their separation.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease excuse us,\u201d Crowley said to Miss Mowbray, and took Aziraphale\u2019s arm and led him out onto the balcony, to a dark corner where they could talk, unobserved.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale got himself together enough to say, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing your ring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m quite devoted to the memory,\u201d Crowley said, entirely honest.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked like he might cry again.</p>\n<p>Crowley couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cHush,\u201d he said, and wiped away a tear from Aziraphale\u2019s cheek with his gloved thumb. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI blame me,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cFor my sake. If that means something to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it does,\u201d Aziraphale said, and gave him a watery smile. \u201cMy dear, for whom else do you imagine I would\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Crowley said with sudden ferocity. \u201cTell me there\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was never anyone else,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cThere won\u2019t ever be. Didn\u2019t we promise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe promised,\u201d Crowley said, and he felt something unfurl inside him.</p>\n<p>It felt like hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cKiss me once before I go,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cMy dear, you can\u2019t imagine what kind of trouble we could find ourselves in, not to mention the human scandal\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet them talk,\u201d Crowley said, and he meant all of them. \u201cWhat are they going to do to me? I\u2019m already Fallen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive me, my dear, but I\u2019ve no wish to find out,\u201d Aziraphale said. He took Crowley\u2019s left hand in his and bowed over it, pressing a kiss to the wedding band.</p>\n<p>Crowley watched him go again, and he didn\u2019t like it any better than Florence, and yet.</p>\n<p>He left the party with a certain lightness to his step, but not before he\u2019d spiked the punch bowl liberally.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>What was Will\u2019s line? The course of true love never did run smooth. In their case, there was a bit of a hiccup over Crowley wanting to lay in a store of holy water to defend them if needed, and then a very public row where Crowley said a number of things he did not mean, and he thought Aziraphale did too. </p>\n<p>Strangely, it turned out you could love someone and still want to drop them in the drink.</p>\n<p>Crowley went around the next day to apologize, only to overhear two young men outside the shop gossiping, looking in the window as they did so.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s the most splendid dancer!\u201d one of said, giggling. \u201cEveryone wonders\u2014you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they might get a chance?\u201d the other asked archly.</p>\n<p>\u201cFreddie said he did, and it was <i>marvelous</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley dropped the bouquet of flowers in the street, and then went home to take an exceedingly sulky nap.</p>\n<p>It lasted almost eighty years. When he woke up, he was a little embarrassed to realize that he\u2019d slept so long, and also that those young men were probably looking at another young man in the shop and not talking about Aziraphale, who couldn\u2019t dance at all. That could have changed in the last eighty years, he supposed. He felt a bit ashamed of the whole thing\u2014Aziraphale would no more be untrue than he would Fall.</p>\n<p>He might have gone a bit overboard in making it up to Aziraphale. Walking into a church was a bit of a <i>statement</i>, and the soles of his feet burned for three years after. But for the shy, pleased looks from Aziraphale in the car on the way back to the shop? Completely worth it.</p>\n<p>And Crowley didn\u2019t stop there. They were spending more time together again, at dinners and films and walks in the park, and Aziraphale was still cautious, but he was more easily persuaded to spend time together socially. And after one film in particular, Crowley went out the next day and bought a leather jacket, a white t-shirt, and a motorcycle, and roared up to the front of the bookshop.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale came out, most likely to tell him off for making all the racket\u2014look, revving the engine was <i>fun</i>\u2014and then stopped in the door to the shop, mouth open.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey angel,\u201d Crowley said, still straddling the bike. \u201cFancy a ride?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn <i>that</i>?\u201d Aziraphale asked. His tone was incredulous, but his expression put Crowley in mind of one he\u2019d made in Florence quite a lot. It said, <i>oh yes please, only persuade me</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, only if you want to,\u201d Crowley said, making a show of being extremely casual. \u201cIt is a little dangerous, so you\u2019d have to climb on behind me and hold on tight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale actually fussed with his hair. \u201cWell, I suppose if you\u2019ve come all this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley patted the seat behind him and let his thighs spread a little wider.</p>\n<p>And that was how he ended up with Aziraphale clutching him so tightly and shrieking in his ear. Not quite the way he wanted it, mind, but still pretty good.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll discorporate us both!\u201d Aziraphale yelped as Crowley took a turn very quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax!\u201d Crowley shouted back. \u201cLive a little, angel!\u201d</p>\n<p>And most astonishingly, Aziraphale did. He all but melted into Crowley, his cheek pressed against Crowley\u2019s shoulder. They stopped at one of those restaurants that Crowley would never be able to find again by himself, but that Aziraphale somehow knew about. The food was delicious, and Aziraphale was just a touch flirtatious, and that treacherous beat of hope pounded away in Crowley\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>After dinner, Crowley said, \u201cLift home? I won\u2019t be cross if you\u2019d rather a taxi.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Aziraphale wetted his lips, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s take the long way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The memory of that evening, the warm night wind in his hair and Aziraphale holding him close\u2014maybe the course of true love didn\u2019t run smooth, but that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t parts of it that were awfully good.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>The world was about to end, and Aziraphale was gone. </p>\n<p>Crowley sat in a bar, and said to no one, \u201cI thought we\u2019d have more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And wasn\u2019t that the cruelest turn of them all? They\u2019d had all the time in the world, right until it had run out. He\u2019d stockpiled holy water with Aziraphale\u2019s help, trying to prepare for a day when he might persuade Aziraphale to his side. </p>\n<p>Not Heaven\u2019s, and certainly never Hell\u2019s. Just his own. Their own. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d get back there, someday,\u201d he said brokenly, and downed the rest of his drink before calling for another. </p>\n<p>And then, miraculously, there was Aziraphale: not gone forever, merely discorporated, and nattering on to him about Tadfield of all things. Crowley was so full of emotion, like when he\u2019d seized Aziraphale in a kiss on VE Day in Trafalgar Square, and he felt like that sea of humanity did back then\u2014relief and shock and blinding joy. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale had finally chosen their side. Crowley was not going to disappoint him.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>It was so risky. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Crowley demanded. \u201cI thought they destroyed you today\u2014yesterday?\u2014my point is, I didn\u2019t save this world so I could live without you in it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked infuriatingly calm. Then again, it was his idea. \u201cIt will work. Agnes said it would, and she was never wrong, my dear. Not once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley paced in front of him. \u201cBut what if\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cMy darling,\u201d Aziraphale interrupted. \u201cIf you won\u2019t trust her, will you trust me? I know this is what we\u2019re meant to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t save this world so I could live without you in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically neither of us did the saving,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gave him a look that managed to be both annoyed and extremely tender. \u201cIt will work. Now, come here.\u201d He put his arms around Crowley. \u201cStay safe,\u201d he whispered, as he\u2019d done hundreds of years before.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a feather out of place,\u201d Crowley reminded him, holding him tight. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not just saying that because they\u2019re my feathers, mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale tipped his head up for a kiss, and Crowley obliged him, putting every last desperate ounce of passion and frustrated longing into it.</p>\n<p>And then Crowley was looking up at his own face, and it was time to go.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>They toasted the world with champagne, and Aziraphale was positively <i>giddy</i>.</p>\n<p>Crowley smiled at him helplessly, and poured them more champagne, and they talked and talked and talked like it was the old days when a century might pass between meetings, and they had so much to catch up on.</p>\n<p>Diners changed around them, and they ordered an obscene number of desserts, and that was about when Crowley realized how much Aziraphale was fidgeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all right there, love?\u201d Crowley asked. It almost came out smooth. Fine, his voice cracked on the last bit.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stared at him, looking all kinds of flustered. And then he dug something out of his pocket and held it out in his closed fist.</p>\n<p>Crowley gamely held out his hand, and Aziraphale dropped something into it.</p>\n<p>It was Aziraphale\u2019s wedding ring, the golden serpent twined around just as bright as it had been, so long ago.</p>\n<p>Before he could even open his mouth to ask what on earth, Aziraphale said abruptly, \u201cPut it back on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley tried to make his mouth form words, but only ended up with a few incoherent noises, and then he was seizing Aziraphale\u2019s hand and sliding the ring back on, and oh\u2014oh no, he was actually crying.</p>\n<p>So was Aziraphale, but he was smiling through his tears. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Crowley said, taking his ring out of his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s always been right here. Just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale slid it on to Crowley\u2019s finger. Unlike the last time, it didn\u2019t give them any grief. There wasn\u2019t any left to give.</p>\n<p>They held each other\u2019s hands, and just as they were leaning in for a kiss, Crowley found himself blurting out, \u201cI bought you a cottage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Aziraphale said, eyebrows going up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to live there. Could just use it for a holiday, if you like,\u201d Crowley babbled on. \u201cOr a honeymoon. Unless you\u2019d rather\u2014we could go back to Florence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the cottage will be perfect,\u201d Aziraphale said, and then kissed him, right in front of all the humans, and presumably, the Almighty Herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI put lots of books in it,\u201d Crowley assured him.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gave him that heart-meltingly soft smile. \u201cWill it have you in it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen that\u2019s enough for me,\u201d Aziraphale said, and kissed him again, and again, and again, until Crowley pulled him up to standing, and somebody miraculously paid the bill, and they stumbled out into the world, together.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
