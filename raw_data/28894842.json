  "notes": "<p>Your irregular reminder that the author has never touched a DC comic in her life.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Dick, staring at Jason: \u2026so my future self dropped off a little kid for us?<br><em>Five seconds later\u2026</em><br>Dick, hugging Jason: *hisses* if anyone so much as lays a finger on my Jaybird, I\u2019m going to cut their whole hand off!<br>Bruce and Alfred, watching on in pride: that\u2019s our boy.</p>\n<p>In this universe, thanks to Jason\u2019s tip, Batman looks into Sheila Haywood much, much earlier, and discovers that she\u2019s Jason\u2019s birth mom. Jason feels horrible for a little while, but ultimately ignores it because he has his own fiercely protective Mama Bird.</p>\n<p>In this universe, Dick does not get into a loud argument with Bruce and storm away from home, because there\u2019s a twelve-year-old kid who\u2019s imprinted on him and he has to set a good example. (Bruce is not above using this argument in pointing out the virtues of a college education.)</p>\n<p>In this universe, Dick passes the Robin mantle to Jason when he\u2019s ready, and tells him about the special meaning behind the name. Jason nearly bursts into tears then and there, Bruce\u2019s eyes are suspiciously shiny, and Alfred has to dot at his eyes with a handkerchief.</p>\n<p>(In this universe, Jason tells them about the little sister that likes waffles, so Dick promptly adopts Spoiler the moment they find out her favorite food.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Jason, starry-eyed: is it my turn to get a baby brother from the dimension storks?<br>Bruce: that\u2019s not how it\u2014well, I guess that is how it works now.</p>\n<p>In this universe, Bruce works out some sort of \u2018temporary\u2019 guardianship with Tim\u2019s parents so that Tim stays with them whenever they\u2019re out of the country. (This is an arrangement that is acceptable to all parties involved, except Jason, who really wanted to break some noses.)</p>\n<p>In this universe, Jason has a little brother to steer his impulses towards benign things, like starting a prank war, whenever he gets angry at Bruce and Dick\u2019s moral philosophies. On one memorable occasion, Tim manages to distract him from his growing argument with Bruce by admitting he\u2019s never read Pride and Prejudice, leading to an impressively detailed rant stretching over a full week.</p>\n<p>In this universe, Jason hands the Robin mantle over to Tim in a solemn ceremony, interspersed by Dick\u2019s tears and unsubtle hints that the name \u2018Flamebird\u2019 has not yet been taken. Tim can\u2019t quite control the twitching of his lips as Jason pointedly ignores Dick.</p>\n<p>(In this universe, they don\u2019t figure out who Hood is, or how he knows so much about them\u2014though Tim has his suspicions, especially after hearing Jason\u2019s adoption story.)</p>\n<p>Content warning: implied/referenced animal death.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Tim, snatching Damian: <em>ha</em>, I finally got one of my own!<br>Bruce: but he\u2019s <em>my</em>\u2014you know what, I give up.</p>\n<p>In this universe, Damian is intimidated by his older siblings and mostly clings to Tim. Tim cements his position of favorite sibling ever by introducing Damian to Selina. Between Tim\u2019s logical arguments and careful coaching of puppy-dog eyes, Bruce is helpless to resist the plans for Damian\u2019s menagerie. (Everyone coos over the baby kitten that Damian carries everywhere.)</p>\n<p>In this universe, thanks to the detailed information left behind, Bruce finds and promptly adopts Cassandra Cain <strike>before any of his children have the chance to snatch another sibling</strike>. He also works off of the groundwork to destroy a large portion of the League\u2019s operations and relegate Ra\u2019s back to the shadows. (Bruce and Talia have a long shouting match concerning kidnapping children and lying about miscarriages, but eventually a custody agreement is worked out.)</p>\n<p>In this universe, Tim passes the Robin mantle to Damian in a move designed to distract Dick and Jason while Tim disappears to follow the trail of a missing Bruce. The deception holds up for all of twenty hours before Tim\u2014new alias Crow\u2014is dragged back from Europe by Cass and both Tim and Damian are grounded while the Justice League works on getting Bruce unstuck from the timestream.</p>\n<p>(In this universe, they all wonder about the Bats from the other dimension and what exactly they\u2019re up to\u2014but it takes a few years before they finally get an explanation.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>When Batman gets home a week later, he immediately confiscates the portal gun. Unfortunately, the damage is already done\u2014they\u2019ve saved Jason from death five times, kidnapped Damian from the League in seven dimensions, stolen Steph in two, lured Cass to the family four times, roped Tim into the family earlier thrice, and prevented the Graysons\u2019 death once. Not to mention the one where tired single dad Bruce is in charge of one teenager, two preteens, two young children, and a wailing newborn.</p>\n<p>Bruce resists the urge to travel to that dimension to give Alfred a raise.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason resisted the urge to take a glance behind him, and kept his pace constant.\u00a0 He wanted to start running, ice-cold prickles trickling down his spine and jolting with every scuff of shoe on pavement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They weren\u2019t trying to hide themselves\u2014footsteps loud and slightly off-balanced, far too close for comfort.\u00a0 Drunk on alcohol and power, and they\u2019d <em>seen</em> the wad of cash Frank handed Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took a deep breath and brushed the edge of an alley, grabbing the exposed brick to take the corner quickly, and speeding up once he was out of sight.\u00a0 He ducked around a dumpster, his heart rate increasing as the loud footsteps\u2014two distinct pairs, Crime Alley drawl, low sniggers\u2014followed him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still had the tire iron in his hands, and he gripped it tightly.\u00a0 A couple of good swings\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The air crackled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a loud screech, like fingernails scraping against the wall, and getting away was momentarily halted by the instinctive urge to cover his ears as the sound grated into his bones.\u00a0 The men shouted, and Jason heard a harsh, rattling gasp and the dull whine of electricity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBat!\u201d someone called out, and the alleyway cleared remarkably fast.\u00a0 Heavy footsteps receded into the distance as something crashed into the opposite side of the dumpster, and Jason stayed frozen in place, waiting for the rustling that always preceded Batman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing.\u00a0 Jason darted a quick look up, but no sign of a dark, fluttering cape.\u00a0 Nothing but the soft groans from the other side of the dumpster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were quiet\u2014hitched breaths and soft, pained sounds\u2014but Jason had learned to keep his ears sharp, and especially so in the last couple months.\u00a0 He edged forward slightly\u2014keeping his grip on his tire iron, the small fold of bills burning a hole in his pocket\u2014and slowly peered around the edge of the dumpster until he could see the unlucky stranger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They blended into the shadows\u2014Jason spent a full ten seconds trying to discern shape before realizing that they were clad in form-fitting black, the faintest hint of a blue design shimmering in the low light.\u00a0 The figure made another pained hiss, shifting up until they were reclined against brick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dark hair.\u00a0 Skin too tan to be white.\u00a0 And a familiar black outline over the eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A <em>mask</em>?\u00a0 Jason frowned.\u00a0 Batman had that stupid pointy-eared cowl, and Robin wore a lot more colors than this.\u00a0 Who was <em>this</em> guy?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tightened his grip on the tire iron as the masked figure pressed a hand to their side, panting soundlessly.\u00a0 He had made sure to keep still and silent, so he was taken aback when the masked figure froze, whiteout lenses suddenly fixed on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stumbled back, his heart hammering, ducking back behind the dumpster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d the figure called out, low with a slight rasp, Gotham drawl with the faintest hint of a dock accent.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason warily poked his head back around the dumpster.\u00a0 The masked figure was smiling slightly, still leaning against the brick wall.\u00a0 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jason asked gruffly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing,\u201d the figure volunteered easily, and Jason stepped a little further out of the shadows\u2014that wasn\u2019t the name of any Gotham villain.\u00a0 \u201cAnd what\u2019s <em>your</em>\u2014Jay?\u201d the figure broke off with a gasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stepped back, raising the tire iron.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Jason snarled, his heartbeat thundering\u2014how had he\u2014who told him\u2014was someone <em>after</em> him\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The figure stared at him for a long moment, lenses widening as they scanned Jason from head to toe\u2014Jason fidgeted under this scrutiny, trying to look taller and broader than he really was.\u00a0 Nightwing was still on the ground, though, and hurt\u2014Jason bet he could take off if he got a good hit at their injured side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Nightwing said finally, their gaze sharpening, \u201cYou looked like someone else.\u00a0 What\u2019s your name, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hesitated, hovering in place\u2014they were injured, and they didn\u2019t <em>look</em> like a villain, so maybe they were a new vigilante\u2014and they had scared off the guys following him.\u00a0 Jason could\u2019ve probably outsmarted two drunk idiots, but if they\u2019d <em>caught</em> him\u2014well. \u00a0\u201cYou can call me Jay,\u201d Jason shrugged, \u201cYou some kind of vigilante?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nightwing grimaced, \u201cFrom Bludhaven.\u201d\u00a0 That unnerving white-eyed gaze was fixed on him, and Jason tensed automatically.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a long way from home,\u201d Jason said cautiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing made a short, unamused laugh.\u00a0 \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d they said dryly, casting a look around the alleyway as though they were seeing it for the first time.\u00a0 They still hadn\u2019t moved to get up, and Nightwing grimaced as they shifted position, their hand curled below the ribs, pressing above their right hip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jay swallowed\u2014but if he left Nightwing here, they\u2019d be found by the criminals or the cops, and neither were a good prospect.\u00a0 \u201cDo you\u2014do you want some help?\u201d he asked quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s gaze fixed on him for a long moment.\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d they said finally, \u201cThat would be great.\u00a0 Thanks, Jay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jay edged all the way around the dumpster, and shifted to holding the tire iron one handed as he held the other out to Nightwing.\u00a0 The vigilante was <em>heavy</em>, and Jason had to brace himself against the dumpster as he pulled them upright.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a vigilante, he seemed pretty short, but he was still half a foot taller than Jason and he edged back a wary step as Nightwing straightened, grimacing as the movement pulled at his side.\u00a0 Jason eyed the injury\u2014he couldn\u2019t see much in the semi-darkness, but the gloves looked suspiciously wet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI know someplace you can\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo hospitals,\u201d Nightwing cut him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Dr. Thompkins doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No hospitals</em>,\u201d Nightwing repeated, his firm tone undercut by the way he was sagging against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had never really occurred to Jason that the capes could be injured.\u00a0 Batman was a night terror\u2014the Dark Knight of Gotham, the nightmare waiting in the shadows, the boogeyman for criminal and civilian alike.\u00a0 Robin\u2014well, half of Gotham didn\u2019t believe Robin was <em>human</em>, and popular ideas included a trickster spirit that Batman had bound to his will.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing looked like a regular human who thought going out in a mask and spandex was a good idea, and had unfortunately run straight into the consequences of that decision.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Jason asked\u2014the vigilante was beginning to shiver.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a graze,\u201d Nightwing smiled at him, which was not an answer to Jason\u2019s question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason bit his lip, hovering near the vigilante as he limped to the end of the alley.\u00a0 \u201cI,\u201d Jason said slowly, \u201cI have a first aid kit.\u00a0 I can get it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing tilted his head to one side, like a curious bird, before he smiled.\u00a0 \u201cThanks, Jay,\u201d he said, \u201cThat would be a great help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Jason instructed, before running all the way home.\u00a0 He checked periodically over his shoulder, but no one seemed to be following him, and he didn\u2019t see even a hint of blue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stuffed the cash underneath the mattress and found the first aid kit buried behind a small wall of painkiller bottles.\u00a0 He grabbed the kit and made sure to lock the door behind him before hurrying back down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing hadn\u2019t moved\u2014he was slumped in the shadows, breathing heavily, and Jason had to call his name two times before the white lenses fixed on him.\u00a0 \u201cHere,\u201d Jason said, handing over the kit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Jay,\u201d Nightwing croaked out, rummaging through the kit before he picked out a tube of antiseptic and some gauze.\u00a0 His gaze swung back to Jason, \u201cYou should get back home.\u00a0 Your parents will be worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason said, feeling the hollow inside his chest ache anew, \u201cI should be getting back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for all your help!\u201d Nightwing called back as Jason left the alley.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t know what had possessed him to go back to the alleyway the next afternoon, as the sunlight waned and the day shifted from the period when well-meaning bystanders would ask unattended children why they weren\u2019t in school to the period when they were allowed to roam the streets with impunity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Understanding people\u2019s expectations was the first step in dodging them, and Jason had learned that well.\u00a0 School wasn\u2019t an option, not now, not when they would ask too many questions\u2014Jason had managed to keep the apartment with a collection of lies, and managed to avoid notice with a different, contrary collection of lies, but he was aware that it would just take one suspicious busybody to bring the whole thing crashing down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suspicious busybodies like the guys that ran around with masks and colorful costumes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jason wasn\u2019t going <em>out of his way</em> to check out the alley, and Nightwing had probably made it back to Bludhaven anyway, so, really, Jason was just checking to make sure he hadn\u2019t dropped something in his run.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alley was empty.\u00a0 Jason took a glance around, poked his head into the shadows, and turned to leave, satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone had moved the dumpster, though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was probably the garbage trucks.\u00a0 Or someone doing some dumpster diving.\u00a0 Or\u2014the dumpster had been shoved closer to the fire escape.\u00a0 Close enough that someone with an injured side would have less difficulty reaching the ladder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason eyed the fire escape, noting closed blinds all the way to the top.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t his business.\u00a0 Nightwing had helped him, but he was a cape, and he\u2019d start asking questions, and that was the <em>last</em> thing Jason needed right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason huffed out a frustrated breath, glanced around him, and took a running start to clamber on top of the dumpster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fire escape was half-rusted, and Jason made his way up warily, pausing at every screeching squeak.\u00a0 He checked every windowsill as he passed it, but found no trace of blood on any of them, and he finally poked his head over the edge of the roof.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a typical apartment roof\u2014rooftop access door, a little shed for maintenance, the air conditioning vents\u2014and showed no signs of any squatters.\u00a0 Admittedly, there was little space for anyone to hide\u2014the maintenance shed was tiny and probably full of equipment, the edging along the roof wasn\u2019t high enough to keep out the wind, and the space between the air conditioning vents was maybe wide enough to fit a small child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s first step on the roof crunched gravel under his shoe, and the air suddenly stilled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looks like he was wrong about the squatter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason warily edged forward, eyeing the shed and the door as he moved closer to the air conditioning vents.\u00a0 He tried to be quiet, but the soft shifting of gravel was very obvious in the still air, as was the increasing tension.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason swallowed before he reached the air conditioning vents.\u00a0 \u201cNightwing?\u201d he called out, feeling a little foolish.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The silence stretched, the tension ratcheting up before\u2014\u201cJay?\u201d Nightwing replied hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason edged around the vents and found Nightwing folded up in the empty space between them.\u00a0 He did <em>not</em> want to know how Nightwing managed to contort himself enough to fit, jeez, did the guy not have bones?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Jay!\u201d Nightwing <em>beamed</em> and, despite the sallow tint to his skin and the red sheen to the torn part of his costume, the smile felt like the sun had woken up.\u00a0 \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you.\u00a0 How are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly better than you,\u201d Jason said, crouching down to get a better look at Nightwing.\u00a0 His suit was thin and stretchy, the dark only broken by the blue design Jason had seen yesterday\u2014it looked like some sort of bird, the wings stretching out to Nightwing\u2019s shoulders and running down his arms to splay across his fingers.\u00a0 \u201cDid you seriously sleep out <em>here</em>?\u00a0 In this weather?\u00a0 Wearing <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The suit was far too thin to offer any sort of protection against the cold\u2014or against <em>anything</em>, Jason could see the edges of white gauze poking through the gash in the costume, dotted with red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI unfortunately didn\u2019t have time to look for a place to stay,\u201d Nightwing said, slowly pushing himself off the ground\u2014he couldn\u2019t entirely hide his wince, though, and Jason could see how fiercely he was clinging to the edge of the vent.\u00a0 \u201cAnd all a bird really needs is a good nest!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bird,\u201d Jason scowled, stepping back at the sheer <em>cheerfulness</em> the man exuded, \u201cAnd I thought you\u2019d be back in Bludhaven by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing gave a half-shrug.\u00a0 \u201cThere were some difficulties with my chosen method of transportation.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m stuck here for a while.\u201d\u00a0 He glanced at the dark watch wrapped around his left wrist and gave Jason a mock mournful look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou planning on sleeping here again?\u201d Jason frowned at him, taking in the tightness of the man\u2019s smile and the weight he was leaning against the vent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other homeless found shelters to stay in, or fires to huddle around, but Jason supposed wearing a mask ruled out both those opportunities.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t many good hiding places in Crime Alley and, this close to winter, all of them would be taken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t <em>that</em> bad,\u201d Nightwing laughed\u2014and shivered when an icy breeze skimmed across the roof.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason would regret this.\u00a0 He <em>knew</em> he would regret this.\u00a0 He should\u2019ve never even come looking for the guy\u2014in Gotham, keeping your mouth shut and your eyes on the ground was the best way to survive.\u00a0 Messing around in other people\u2019s business was just asking for trouble.\u00a0 Messing around with <em>capes</em> was asking for a bullet to the back, or fear gas to the face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Nightwing kept smiling, the joyfulness completely at odds with Gotham\u2019s dour nature, and yet the smile never looked fake for a second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you buy dinner,\u201d Jason said before he could talk himself out of it, \u201cYou can stay at my place tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing looked at him\u2014still smiling, but clearly as wary of the offer as Jason was giving it.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 If he\u2019d jumped for it\u2014if a strange man in Gotham had eagerly followed a little boy home, Jason would\u2019ve kicked him between the legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was okay.\u00a0 Nightwing was injured, and Jason still had his tire iron.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre your parents going to be okay with that?\u201d Nightwing asked slowly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason chewed his lip, but Nightwing would find out soon anyway.\u00a0 \u201cDad\u2019s in jail,\u201d he said casually, \u201cMom\u2019s in the hospital.\u00a0 No one will mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Nightwing said, a thread of doubt winding into his tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they started moving, it was clear the Nightwing was nowhere <em>near</em> fine.\u00a0 He was woozy on his feet, and Jason\u2019s plan to go down the fire escape had to be shelved in favor of picking the lock on the rooftop access door and using the actual stairs, because half of Nightwing\u2019s weight was on his shoulder and the man looked frighteningly pale under the mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo hospitals,\u201d Nightwing repeated firmly.\u00a0 Jason glowered at him as they exited the building.\u00a0 Nightwing took the opportunity to lean against the wall and fished around in the pockets of his belt before withdrawing a crumpled twenty dollar bill.\u00a0 \u201cHere,\u201d he offered it to Jason, \u201cGet some chili dogs for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was an offer Jason wasn\u2019t going to decline.\u00a0 He snatched the bill and headed for the closest chili dog stand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he came back with a warm bag oozing out delicious smells, Nightwing was still upright, but breathing heavily.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t ask for the change back, and Jason didn\u2019t mention it, instead helping the vigilante hobble through the shadows and back to his apartment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had a momentary flicker of fear when he let Nightwing inside, but all the vigilante did was stumble the three steps to the couch and sink into it with a pained moan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jason said, fidgeting, \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWater,\u201d Nightwing croaked out, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hurried to the kitchen, grateful for something to do.\u00a0 By the time he unwrapped the chili dogs and brought out the water, Nightwing had gone from sitting to lying down, folded up on their ratty couch and staring up at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jason said, handing over the glass of water\u2014and froze, because Nightwing had removed his mask, revealing an irritated red line around tired blue eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was younger than Jason had been expecting\u2014he couldn\u2019t be more than twenty-five.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nightwing smiled softly, and extended his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Dick.\u00a0 Nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shook the hand before the words caught all the way up.\u00a0 \u201cWait, <em>what</em>?\u00a0 What kind of parents name their kid Dick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s short for Richard,\u201d Nightwing\u2014<em>Dick</em> answered him cheerfully, taking the glass.\u00a0 He gulped it down like he hadn\u2019t had water in <em>days</em>, and when he was done, he slumped back with a groan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Jason grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all the jokes, trust me, kid,\u201d Dick laughed, \u201c<em>All of them</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was pretty sure that hadn\u2019t been <em>intended</em> as a challenge, but Dick\u2019s eyes were glittering and Jason\u2019s competitiveness had been piqued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took a bite of the chili dog as he tried to think of some good ones, and nudged the other foil wrapper to Dick.\u00a0 \u201cEat,\u201d Jason instructed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a bit,\u201d Dick rasped, his eyes fluttering closed, his face stuck in a pained grimace.\u00a0 Jason could only see the one wound, but the way Dick was curled up hinted at broken ribs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get cold,\u201d Jason pressed, something icy settling in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Dick said softly, eyes still squeezed shut, and the picture\u2014sweaty skin, bags under eyes, chewed-red lips, soft, pained gasps\u2014matched Jason\u2019s nightmares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason slowly finished chewing his bite and swallowed it, hoping his stomach wouldn\u2019t rebel.\u00a0 \u201cYou need to eat,\u201d he said, the same half-pleading, half-stern tone he\u2019d used for so long, \u201cYou need to get your strength up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s eyes fluttered open, and he watched Jason silently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEat,\u201d Jason repeated, \u201c<em>Please</em>.\u00a0 Just one bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay,\u201d Dick said quietly, \u201cIf I eat something right now, it\u2019s just going to come back up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How many nights had he listened to his mother retching in the bathroom, coming out with tears in her eyes and blood dripping from her nose?\u00a0 How many times had she foregone food\u2014not for his benefit, but because she couldn\u2019t muster up the will to eat?\u00a0 How much had she wasted away before the end, till where Jason could count every bone in her body as it jutted against sallow skin?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason set down his food and hurried to the bathroom.\u00a0 There was a small collection of painkillers back there\u2014different prescriptions his mother had tried before she got hooked onto heroin and didn\u2019t stop\u2014and Jason scanned each one until he found a couple that didn\u2019t have loss of appetite as a side effect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been planning to sell them\u2014rent didn\u2019t come cheap, no one would offer a full-time job to a ten-year-old, and he knew the dealers that would give fair prices for pills\u2014but a few pills wasn\u2019t any great loss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have painkillers,\u201d Jason shoved the bottles at a surprised Dick, who attempted to catch them all before they hit the ground, \u201cOne of these should help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick looked at the bottles, and blinked at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re my mom\u2019s,\u201d Jason answered the unasked question, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u00a0 You need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s face crinkled.\u00a0 \u201cThanks, Jay,\u201d Dick smiled, \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t take your mother\u2019s pills.\u201d\u00a0 He tried to hand the bottles back, but Jason refused to take them, scowling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe won\u2019t mind,\u201d Jason said, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u00a0 She\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dick said, face bright, \u201cI don\u2019t need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>hurt</em>,\u201d Jason repeated, his voice rising, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt and bleeding and you spent a whole day on a roof and I bet you haven\u2019t eaten anything all day.\u00a0 Just take the stupid pill!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick carefully stacked each bottle on the floor.\u00a0 \u201cJay,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI can\u2019t take someone else\u2019s medication.\u00a0 They\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Jason said, aware that his voice was climbing pitches, \u201cThey\u2019ll just give her a new prescription!\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t need these pills anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, Jay\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason picked all the bottles up, and shoved them back into Dick\u2019s arms.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t watch the man\u2019s pained face.\u00a0 Not without remembering his mother.\u00a0 Not without remembering\u2014they ran out, Jason couldn\u2019t get any more, and his mother was shaking and crying and Jason couldn\u2019t even <em>hug</em> her without her screaming and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he\u2019d gone to the streets and found any way he could to get her the stuff\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust take it!\u201d Jason almost screamed, \u201cYou\u2019re <em>hurting</em>, just\u2014stop it, stop pretending you\u2019re some stupid hero and take a goddamn pill!\u201d\u00a0 His eyes were blurring, and he didn\u2019t even know <em>why</em>\u2014he didn\u2019t know Nightwing, he didn\u2019t care about Dick, he didn\u2019t care about the pinched furrow on his face or the rigidity of his jaw or the hundred different tells that taught him about concealing pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiddo, these are your <em>mom\u2019s</em>, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t help her anymore,\u201d Jason cut off hoarsely, withdrawing further into his hoodie and hoping that the tears wouldn\u2019t fall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s face was concerned, blue eyes wide and forehead furrowed and when he spoke, his voice was soft and hesitant.\u00a0 \u201cJay?\u201d he asked slowly, \u201cIs your mom really in the hospital?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason snapped his head up, choking on a gasp, and burning washed over his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick looked worried, anxious, like the teachers who wanted to talk to his parents or the volunteers that eyed him when he walked past the shelter and he <em>knew</em> that someone would figure it out eventually\u2014and Dick was in his <em>home</em> and he\u2019d lose this too, he\u2019d lose the last thing he had of his mother and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason bolted for the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He got three blocks away before he stumbled to a halt, hot tears curving down his cheeks, and pressed his back to the coarse brick of an alley as he shook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick <em>knew</em>.\u00a0 And Jason didn\u2019t know much about capes, but he knew they worked <em>with</em> the cops, so Dick had probably already called CPS.\u00a0 They would be at his home, and they\u2019d find out that Mom was dead and Dad was in jail and\u2014and they\u2019d take Jason <em>away</em>, and Jason knew what happened to kids in the system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Living in Crime Alley was rough.\u00a0 But he\u2019d had a Mom and Dad that <em>protected</em> him, and every gang knew that messing with a kid that had parents was not a good idea.\u00a0 Especially not when there were so many unattached ones out there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wished he could\u2019ve gotten his stuff.\u00a0 Some clothes.\u00a0 Food.\u00a0 His money.\u00a0 The picture of his mom and him at a fair.\u00a0 The last Mother\u2019s Day card he\u2019d made her, the one she cried over and stuck to the refrigerator.\u00a0 The <em>tire iron</em>, at least.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he needed a head start more than all those things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason roughly wiped at his face and headed for the mouth of the alley\u2014he needed to find a place to hole up for the night, and bawling like a baby wouldn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the moment he stepped back onto the street, he was spotted by the same two idiots that had been following him yesterday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason cursed and spun on his heel, but he wasn\u2019t fast enough to avoid the shout of recognition.\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d one of them called out, \u201cIt\u2019s that kid with the cash!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>.\u00a0 Jason <em>ran</em>, but heavy, pounding footsteps followed behind him, and a hand closed around his arm before he managed to take an alley shortcut.\u00a0 Jason allowed himself to be pulled with the movement, and used his momentum to ram an elbow in the guy\u2019s gut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guy left go, coughing, and Jason twisted back\u2014the other guy tried to grab him, and Jason kicked out at his kneecap and the guy howled in pain.\u00a0 Jason turned to flee\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And was halted by the <em>click</em> of a gun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMove,\u201d Thug No. 1 said, raspy, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll blow your brains out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason swallowed, and let the guy fist a hand in the collar of his hoodie and slam him back against the brick wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the money, brat?\u201d Thug No. 2 said as the gun pressed painfully against his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCut the crap, kid,\u201d Trigger Happy snarled, trying to use the gun as a drill, \u201cWe know you got some cash.\u00a0 Tell us where it is, or we\u2019ll take it out your hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason flitted his gaze between the two of them.\u00a0 \u201cAt\u2014at home,\u201d he said, working a stutter into his voice\u2014the cops were probably already at the apartment, and besides, Jason wasn\u2019t <em>lying</em>.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A finger closed around the gun\u2019s trigger.\u00a0 \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid enough to believe that?\u201d the guy scoffed, \u201cA kid like you is always carrying some cash around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thug No. 2 was looking at Jason in the kind of speculation that made him want to take five showers.\u00a0 \u201cWe can always search him,\u201d he suggested, quiet and dark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trigger Happy looked like he was seriously considering the idea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Jason snarled, bucking against the grip.\u00a0 He\u2019d done a <em>lot</em> of things to get money to help his mother, but there was one thing he swore he wouldn\u2019t do.\u00a0 \u201cGet off me!\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any fucking money, you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason broke off as something moved in the shadows.\u00a0 Darkness.\u00a0 A flicker of blue.\u00a0 A mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thugs followed his gaze and turned, blinking at the newcomer.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not the Bat,\u201d the stupider of the two said, frowning at the sleek costume, the blue bird symbol, and the long\u2026batons?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The batons crackled with blue sparks of electricity.\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Nightwing smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trigger Happy was smart enough to turn the gun on the greater threat, but not smart enough to shoot immediately.\u00a0 The baton hit his hand so hard that several things cracked, and dull whine of electricity after sent the guy into gurgled screams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second one had clearly decided to abandon his friend\u2014Bat-honed instincts serving them well\u2014and Jason watched in no small amount of awe as Nightwing, injured and wobbly and in significant pain, managed to take down his adversary so fluidly it felt choreographed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing still looked like the sun.\u00a0 But the sun was also a flaming ball of gas in the middle of space, hot enough to disintegrate, and every ounce of that threat was laced into that smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing turned towards him, and the smile softened to something less\u2026terrifying.\u00a0 \u201cJay,\u201d he said quietly, taking a hobbling step towards him, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hadn\u2019t heard someone sound so concerned about him since his mother died.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hadn\u2019t heard someone sound so concerned about him since before his mother got lost in the haze of drugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t stop the tears slipping down his face, and Nightwing\u2019s expression shifted to sudden alarm.\u00a0 \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Nightwing said worriedly, holstering his batons and stepping closer to Jason, \u201cDid they\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment Nightwing was close enough to reach, Jason lunged forward and buried his head in the man\u2019s costume, wrapping his arms around him.\u00a0 He heard Nightwing\u2019s startled, harsh wheeze and then realized that that was probably not the brightest idea.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jason said through hitched breaths, \u201cI\u2014I forgot you were hurt, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Nightwing said, his voice slightly strained, and he tugged Jason down until they were both crouching on the ground.\u00a0 Jason flung his arms around Nightwing\u2019s neck this time, burying his face into his shoulder, and cried even harder when Nightwing\u2019s arms slowly wrapped around his back.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jay,\u201d Nightwing murmured, \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice dropped to something lower, something fiercer, \u201cI <em>promise</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing held Jason until he\u2019d exhausted all his tears, and rubbed his back as Jason tried to regain control of his hitched breaths.\u00a0 The two thugs were left groaning and twitching in the alley, and Jason didn\u2019t protest as Nightwing gently steered them back to his apartment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his surprise, no cops or social workers were waiting for them, and Dick merely made a muted groan as he sank back onto the couch and peeled off his mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason peered into the bedroom, but there was no one waiting to ambush him.\u00a0 He drifted back towards the couch, and squinted at Dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick noticed after a solid ten seconds of staring, and raised an eyebrow, his expression twisting into a half-scowl to do so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call the cops,\u201d Jason said finally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a phone,\u201d Dick yawned, \u201c<em>You</em> don\u2019t have a phone.\u00a0 And besides, I\u2019m tired.\u00a0 Those two guys can learn their lesson with some broken bones this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason frowned, \u201cI meant for me.\u201d\u00a0 Dick looked confused.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2014that my mom\u2019s dead.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t call them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s face brightened in comprehension, and then fell in sorrow.\u00a0 \u201cI know what Gotham\u2019s foster care system is like,\u201d he said, and there was a bite in his voice that was all too real, \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you into its jaws.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh.\u00a0 Jason had the sudden urge to fling himself into Dick\u2019s arms to get another one of those hugs, shaky in sudden relief, but Dick\u2019s face was pinched and wan and Jason slowly shuffled back to the pill bottles.\u00a0 He held them up wordlessly, and Dick made a face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jason said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick sighed, and Jason pressed his advantage.\u00a0 He dumped all the bottles in Dick\u2019s lap, and Dick sorted through each of them, carefully reading the labels before keeping it or placing it aside.\u00a0 Finally, he settled on over-the-counter ibuprofen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to take that on an empty stomach,\u201d Jason said, trying to cover up the tiny curl of relief.\u00a0 Dick was in a not-inconsiderable amount of pain, and while one of the prescription painkillers would\u2019ve definitely helped more, Jason knew where that road led.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick sighed again, but he reached for the now-cold chili dog and carefully broke it into half, offering Jason the other piece.\u00a0 Jason took the compromise, accepting the chili dog and sitting on the couch.\u00a0 He gave it a few seconds before he shifted, curling against Dick\u2019s uninjured side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick smiled at him, and rested a casual arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the midst of eating and taking the pill and washing it down with water, Dick\u2019s fingers had migrated to his hair, running through it and gently tugging on the ends, and the repetitive motion lulled Jason to sleep.\u00a0 His head drooped against Nightwing\u2019s shoulder and, when there was no complaint, he decided it was too heavy to lift up again.</p>\n<p><br>The fingers were soft and soothing, and they were joined by a low, lilting song in a language Jason didn\u2019t recognize, and before he realized it, darkness had cocooned him in a warm embrace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason woke up with his head resting on someone\u2019s lap.\u00a0 <em>Mom</em>, he thought drowsily, before remembering that his mother\u2019s legs had been far bonier.\u00a0 Before remembering that his mother was dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>That</em> jolted him the rest of the way awake, and Jason scrambled up to meet Dick\u2019s teasing smile.\u00a0 \u201cHave a good night\u2019s sleep, Jay?\u201d Dick laughed softly, and the sound was so much brighter with some of the pain lines on his forehead relaxed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s cheeks burned\u2014he\u2019d prided himself on his survival instincts, and he fell asleep on a <em>stranger</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A stranger who had saved him twice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A stranger who\u2019d hugged him and sung him a song.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A stranger who was giving Jason a twinkling smile, soft and amused\u2014almost like his mother on one of her good days, when she would nudge a grouchy Jason out of bed with kisses and tickles and have waffles waiting on the counter once he brushed his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want waffles?\u201d Jason asked abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick\u2019s eyebrows raised, but he nodded, still amused.\u00a0 Jason got off the couch and headed to the kitchen to get everything ready, Dick following at a slower pace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like waffles?\u201d Jason asked as he got out the flour.\u00a0 Dick had taken a seat at the kitchen table and was watching him with idle curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay,\u201d Dick said, tilting his head to one side, \u201cMy little sister loves them, so she makes them a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s heart sank.\u00a0 He busied himself with the batter, cracking eggs with ease and adding them in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a big family?\u201d he asked, still turned away from Dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick laughed, though Jason didn\u2019t know what was so funny.\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cI have my fair share of siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose they\u2019re missing you,\u201d he said to the batter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Dick said, his chuckles dying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take me to go home, though.\u201d\u00a0 When Jason turned, he caught Dick staring at his watch, his face drawn into a frown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason cast around for something to change the topic.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you met me, you said I reminded you of someone,\u201d Jason said, casting a curious glance at Dick, \u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick had gone tense, but looked like he was doing his best to pretend that he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 \u201cJay,\u201d he said softly, \u201cMy little brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christ on a cracker, how many siblings did the guy have?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jason said, mixing the batter perhaps more thoroughly than required, \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dick hummed, \u201cHe was ranting about book-to-movie adaptations the last time I saw him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBook-to-movie adaptations suck all the fun out of the book,\u201d Jason replied automatically.\u00a0 Something spasmed across Dick\u2019s face before he drew out a wavering smile and raised his hands in surrender.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many waffles do you want?\u201d Jason asked roughly\u2014Dick had a whole family waiting for him, and he wasn\u2019t even <em>from</em> Gotham.\u00a0 Dick would leave, like everyone else left, and Jason had to be grateful for what he had\u2014Dick had saved him, and hadn\u2019t called the cops, which meant that Jason had a roof over his head for a little while longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo?\u201d Dick said, and Jason plated the first one before sliding it over.\u00a0 Dick dug in with gusto and numerous appreciative noises.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jason said as he poured in the batter for the second waffle, \u201cHow long are you staying in Gotham?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick scowled at his watch again.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he sighed, \u201cMy transport needs to be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t know why the guy couldn\u2019t just take off his mask, put on a coat, and take the train to Bludhaven.\u00a0 Capes were weird.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have anywhere to stay?\u201d Jason checked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Dick exhaled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason chewed his lip.\u00a0 He was having trouble making this month\u2019s rent, and Dick hadn\u2019t <em>done</em> anything to him\u2014sure, he was injured, but capes were supposed to be the good guys, right?\u00a0 His mom had always told him that Batman would protect him, even if he got caught running drugs, because Batman didn\u2019t hurt kids.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stay here if you want,\u201d Jason shrugged, overly casual, busying himself with the wafflemaker, \u201cYou can pay half-rent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence greeted him, and Jason resisted the urge to raise his shoulders.\u00a0 He turned\u2014had Dick already <em>left</em>?\u2014and met the older man\u2019s level gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was staring at Jason like he was a puzzle, face blank but eyes focused, and Jason fought the urge to shiver.\u00a0 Finally, Dick smiled\u2014like the sun peeking out of the clouds.\u00a0 \u201cThat sounds great, Jay, thank you,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to pay half-rent, though,\u201d Jason warned.\u00a0 Scrounging up only half the rent would be much easier than the full thing, and then Jason could pay the gas bill this time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Dick said, smiling bright.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was temporary, and Jason just needed the grace period before he looked old enough that restaurants and mechanic shops would agree to hire him off the books.\u00a0 He had the space, and he needed the money.\u00a0 If he sold the rest of the pills and hid the valuables, Dick would have nothing to steal, either.\u00a0 It was a win-win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason found that he couldn\u2019t resist returning the smile with a quiet one of his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason finished his work a little early, and walked inside the apartment to see Dick pacing, his hair sticking up like he\u2019d run his fingers through it several times, and a half-crazed look in his eyes\u2014a gaze he immediately turned on Jason when he stepped inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jason asked warily, scanning the room.\u00a0 Nothing seemed to be out of place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dick said, his smile strained, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be back so late.\u00a0 I was just worried.\u201d\u00a0 He darted a quick look at his watch, and winced.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jason frowned, \u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0 He fell back on the couch and let himself bounce.\u00a0 \u201cAnything interesting happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another look at the watch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dick said, and then immediately followed that up with, \u201cMaybe.\u201d\u00a0 He winced.\u00a0 \u201cPotentially?\u201d he tried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick took a deep breath and let it out, equally slowly.\u00a0 He glanced at his watch, and made a face.\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d Dick said levelly, \u201cYou\u2019re good at removing tires, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason half-shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m practicing,\u201d he said, \u201cI could be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick said, clearly ignoring his answer, \u201cI\u2026might\u2019ve found us a car.\u00a0 The tires will rake in a lot of cash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason, very slowly, raised an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cYou <em>want</em> me to steal tires?\u201d Jason asked incredulously, \u201cI thought you were supposed to be a vigilante.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dick said solemnly, \u201cThis is for the greater good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wasn\u2019t sure how stealing tires was in anyway good, but maybe they were mob tires or something.\u00a0 Which was a problem of its own, Jason didn\u2019t want some gang chasing after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the car?\u201d Jason asked, wondering what kind of tires fetched \u2018a lot of cash\u2019.\u00a0 He\u2019d managed to get paid at pretty standard rates so far, considering he brought in a tire at a time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With an accomplice, he could get more than one tire.\u00a0 And Dick was too injured to double-cross him, so maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Batmobile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason choked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Excuse me</em>?\u201d he spluttered once he finally managed to regain his breath, \u201cYou want to steal tires from <em>Batman</em>?\u00a0 Are you out of your fucking mind?\u00a0 He\u2019ll <em>murder </em>us\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hurt kids,\u201d Dick said firmly.\u00a0 Ah, so <em>that</em> was what he was after\u2014Jason was supposed to play human shield.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason ignored the curl of betrayal in his gut and stepped forward, narrowing his eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s <em>Batman</em>.\u00a0 He\u2019ll find us anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if we get rid of the tires quickly,\u201d Dick shrugged, unconcerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe will!\u00a0 He\u2019ll be furious!\u00a0 He\u2019ll tear the city apart trying to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Dick rolled his eyes, \u201cThe guy\u2019s <em>rich</em>, he won\u2019t care about a couple of tires.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him, his heart pounding.\u00a0 \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, his words tasting like fury and fear and disappointment, \u201cThat this isn\u2019t some stupid cape vendetta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick immediately looked mournful.\u00a0 \u201cNo, Jay, it\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI just\u2014I wanted to find a way to cover the expenses.\u201d\u00a0 He knelt down until he could look Jason in the eyes.\u00a0 \u201cTrust me?\u201d he asked, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason scowled.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d he snapped, and Dick\u2019s expression cracked.\u00a0 Jason tried to tell himself that he didn\u2019t feel guilt, and hardened his heart\u2014if Dick thought the offer of being roommates meant Jason would allow him to push him around, then he was going to discover how <em>else</em> Jason could use a tire iron.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 I\u2019ll find a different way to get money.\u201d\u00a0 He looked at his watch, and his whole face sort of crumpled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had effectively trapped him, hadn\u2019t he\u2014there was no way Dick could find a legal way to make money, not without revealing his identity, and he was too injured to go find some minimum-wage labor that didn\u2019t ask too many questions, and Dick had found Jason an opportunity all wrapped up in a bow, and Jason shot him down entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason muttered gruffly, \u201cWe\u2019ll go after the goddamn Batmobile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick blinked at him, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if I get beat up, I would\u2019ve still managed to steal Batman\u2019s tires,\u201d Jason shrugged, and went to go get ready, \u201cHow many people can say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick made an odd, half-choked laugh, but accompanied Jason with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay,\u201d Nightwing said suddenly.\u00a0 Jason gave him a quizzical look\u2014they were passing through the East End on their hunt for the Batmobile, and Nightwing had surprisingly kept up the pace.\u00a0 \u201cCan you remember something for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nightwing said, and took a deep breath, \u201cJust\u2014just don\u2019t forget, okay?\u201d\u00a0 He glanced at his watch again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jason said, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing took another deep breath and exhaled quickly.\u00a0 \u201cSheila Haywood is working for the Joker,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason waited, but that was apparently the whole message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cI got it.\u00a0 Sheila Haywood is working for the Joker.\u201d\u00a0 Jason wondered if it was supposed to be Nightwing\u2019s get-out-of-jail card, everyone knew that Batman always appreciated info on the Joker\u2019s movements.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing exhaled so heavily he nearly slumped.\u00a0 \u201cThanks, Jay,\u201d he smiled, looking like a weight was off his back, \u201cNow onto the Batmobile!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shushed him, but couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face as they crept through the streets.\u00a0 True to Nightwing\u2019s word, the Batmobile was sitting in an alley near a nice apartment complex.\u00a0 Jason eyed the building, but this was Gotham\u2014anyone with any sense kept their mouths shut and their blinds closed.\u00a0 Especially if it was Bat business.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we doing this?\u201d Jason asked, eyeing the car and eyeing Nightwing\u2014the walk had taken a lot out of him, he was breathing shallowly again.\u00a0 \u201cOne on each side?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Nightwing said hoarsely, and Jason went to jack up the car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason still had to kick at the tire iron to get the bolts to unstick, and it took a sweaty, cursing five minutes before it loosened up enough for him to get to work.\u00a0 A few minutes later, he finally had the tire off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No alarms, electric shocks, or looming capes.\u00a0 This could actually work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which was, of course, when Jason realized that he hadn\u2019t heard anything from Nightwing in a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing?\u201d Jason hissed, cautiously peering around the car, behind him, and up for good measure.\u00a0 No rustling cape in sight.\u00a0 He edged to the other side of the car.\u00a0 \u201cNightwing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing was on the ground, his breaths low and shallow, curled up in a small ball.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nightwing</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing made a small, choked sound and Jason frantically pulled him onto his back, searching for injuries and checking to make sure his wound hadn\u2019t reopened.\u00a0 \u201cNightwing,\u201d Jason hissed, \u201cWhat happened?\u00a0 Are you okay?\u00a0 We need to get you to a hospital\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nightwing shook his head weakly, \u201cNo hospitals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wanted to shake the man.\u00a0 Jason wanted to <em>cry</em>.\u00a0 \u201cYou might <em>die</em> if you don\u2019t, you stubborn fool!\u201d Jason snarled, \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014you need actual help\u2014you need to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing raised his hand to check his watch, and Jason wanted to grab his shoulders and scream.\u00a0 \u201cNot much time left,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason felt a chill run through him at the words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, clutching his shoulders, \u201cNo\u2014no, you\u2019re not leaving\u2014you can\u2019t go\u2014you have to <em>fight</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing raised a wavering hand and brushed a lock of hair out of his face, smiling softly.\u00a0 \u201cThank you for everything, Jay,\u201d he said, and Jason\u2019s eyes started burning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Jason said, his voice cracking, \u201cYou\u2019re not <em>dying</em>\u2014\u201d Jason couldn\u2019t do this again, he <em>couldn\u2019t</em>, stupid Nightwing, stupid Dick, stupid Jason for getting fucking <em>attached</em>\u2014he knew everyone always left him, he <em>knew</em> it, and Dick had to literally appear out of nowhere and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember what I told you,\u201d Nightwing murmured, his hand slipping off of Jason\u2019s face, \u201cAnd stay out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing\u2014Dick\u2014<em>no</em>\u2014please\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A loud, screeching noise, so awful it tore into Jason\u2019s head and he had to clasp his hands over his ears, his eyes watering as he saw Dick\u2019s fractured smile and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing had disappeared into thin air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at the empty spot for a long moment, stunned, before reality trickled in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing was <em>gone</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason murmured, and then again, louder, \u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0 His cry rose to a scream, \u201c<em>No</em>!\u201d\u00a0 Tears slipped down his face, and he didn\u2019t even care about them anymore, he scrabbled at the asphalt, but there was no trace of the man, no sign that he hadn\u2019t been a figment of Jason\u2019s imagination.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing around him but the half-stripped car, no hint of black-and-blue lurking in the shadows, nothing to indicate that Dick had ever been there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back,\u201d Jason whispered, \u201cPlease, <em>please</em> come back\u2014\u201d he should\u2019ve taken Dick to a hospital that first night, he was so <em>stupid</em>\u2014\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me, you\u2014you said you\u2019d stay, you <em>can\u2019t</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice broke into furious sobs and Jason pressed his fingers against empty ground and <em>cried</em>\u2014this was even worse than his mother, because he still had the chance to hold her, to curl fingers into her cold hand and pet her hair before the ambulance had arrived, and now he was left with <em>nothing</em>\u2014and maybe it had just been a cruel dream the whole time, maybe his mind was torturing him\u2014and he <em>didn\u2019t know</em> because no one had seen Nightwing except him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason wiped his face but the tears kept falling, hot and thick and choking, and he wanted to curl up and cry and remember that warm, encompassing hug and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A rustling sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And no Nightwing to protect him.\u00a0 Jason scrambled upright, his fingers searching for the tire iron, as he turned, ready to swing, looking up\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And <em>up</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason made a small whimper.\u00a0 He\u2019d been crying next to the <em>Batmobile</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman stared down at him, every inch the dark, silent terror.\u00a0 And that was a lot of inches.\u00a0 Jason backed up, nearly banging his head against the fancy car, and gripped the tire iron tightly.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t take on Batman and win\u2014but Nightwing had said that Batman didn\u2019t hurt kids, so maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait a minute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Jason demanded, pushing himself off the ground, \u201cGive him back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Batman growled, and Jason set his face into a snarl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He swung the tire iron\u2014Batman caught the movement, and tore the weapon from Jason\u2019s hands, but Jason just fell back to using his fists.\u00a0 \u201cGive him back!\u201d Jason shouted, flailing as Batman picked him up by the hoodie, \u201cYou stole him, I know you did, it\u2019s just a stupid <em>tire</em>, give him back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Batman growled, \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0 Like he didn\u2019t know, the <em>bastard</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason kicked out, and inhaled sharply when Batman used the movement to grab his shoulders, forcing his arms to his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman didn\u2019t hurt kids.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But looking up at a six foot monster made of shadows and darkness, Jason wasn\u2019t willing to put his faith in a rumor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, you\u2019re scaring him,\u201d a higher voice chirped from above him, and Jason couldn\u2019t manage to pause his high, fluttering breaths to see who the newcomer was.\u00a0 But the steel bands around his arms let go, and Jason\u2019s knees had turned to jelly somewhere in the interval, because he promptly fell back onto the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason scrambled back, only stopping when his back hit the car, and curled up into a small ball.\u00a0 If he tucked his face in and protected his stomach, it wouldn\u2019t hurt so much.\u00a0 \u201cGive him back,\u201d Jason pleaded, his words stuttering.\u00a0 He had to <em>try.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive who back?\u201d the softer voice asked, and Jason warily uncurled, just enough to see the new speaker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red, green, and yellow was pretty distinctive.\u00a0 \u201cR-Robin,\u201d Jason said through a hiccupping breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Robin smiled\u2014there was something familiar about that smile.\u00a0 \u201cDid someone go missing?\u00a0 Were you looking for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne and a half tires off,\u201d Batman\u2019s growl floated from somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014he <em>disappeared</em>,\u201d Jason said, glancing at the road again, like it contained some clue to Nightwing\u2019s whereabouts.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a loud sound, like nails on a chalkboard, and he was <em>gone</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman appeared in his periphery again, some weird device in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try to find him,\u201d Robin soothed, \u201cIs he your dad?\u00a0 Are your parents around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s lip wobbled.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d he said, the words spilling out, \u201cMy parents aren\u2019t around\u2014he\u2019s my older brother\u2014he just <em>vanished</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidence of time magic,\u201d Batman said roughly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Time</em> <em>magic</em>?\u00a0 What the hell?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though, Jason supposed that if aliens and fish people were real, magic wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> crazy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, can you describe him for me?\u00a0 What\u2019s his name?\u201d Robin asked, gentle and cheerful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI mean, Dick.\u201d\u00a0 If the choice was between a revealed identity and being lost in time, Jason knew what <em>he\u2019d</em> pick.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026twenty-four?\u201d Jason estimated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In front of him, Robin had gone very, <em>very</em> still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman went from hovering in his periphery to looming behind Robin, his presence dark and wrathful.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis name is Dick,\u201d Jason repeated, his voice wavering, \u201cHe\u2019s a vigilante who goes by Nightwing.\u00a0 He\u2019s twenty-four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a long, stretching period of silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTime magic,\u201d Robin said softly.\u00a0 Abruptly, he leapt up, jumping on top of the Batmobile to get to the other side, leaving Jason alone with a brooding Batman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shrank back against the car, huddling into his hoodie.\u00a0 Robin was back before he could count to twenty, holding a small sketchbook, which he immediately pressed into Jason\u2019s hands.\u00a0 \u201cTell me if you recognize any of those,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shot him a wary glance, but flipped through the book\u2014they seemed to be doodles of costume designs, and Jason dutifully glanced at each one before turning the page, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A bird, shaded lighter than the dark costume around it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Jason said, shoving the sketch at Robin, \u201cThat\u2019s the design on Nightwing\u2019s suit!\u00a0 Do you know him?\u00a0 Do you know where he is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin looked at the design, and then back at him, staring at him with an intensity that was unnerving through the whiteout lenses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Batman said, in what was definitely a warning tone, but Robin didn\u2019t acknowledge him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a book of my costume ideas,\u201d Robin said quietly, \u201cSometimes bright colors don\u2019t work for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, but what did this have to do with Nightwing?\u00a0 Was Robin taking inspiration from him?\u00a0 Would someone just <em>tell him </em>where Nightwing was?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing is a bird from Kryptonian legend,\u201d Robin continued, \u201cUncle Clark told me the story.\u201d\u00a0 Batman made an abortive growl.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a cool name, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him.\u00a0 The tension was so thick it was beginning to chafe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin reached up\u2026and peeled off his domino mask.\u00a0 He smiled, blue eyes lighting up, and Jason\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Robin said, holding out his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Dick Grayson.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him.\u00a0 At a face that was years younger than when he saw it last, but still very, very familiar.\u00a0 At the uncommon name\u2014and he <em>knew</em> that name, wasn\u2019t that the circus kid Bruce Wayne had adopted?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d called him Jay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d bought him chili dogs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d known about his <em>mom</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d placed Jason deliberately in the path of Batman and Robin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He said Jason reminded him of his little brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He said he didn\u2019t know how to get home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He said he was running out of <em>time</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDick?\u201d Jason asked weakly.\u00a0 Robin nodded, still smiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That meant\u2014that meant that Nightwing hadn\u2019t <em>disappeared</em>.\u00a0 That meant that Dick wasn\u2019t <em>gone</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason could feel something crack inside of him, splintering through the wall he\u2019d forced up after his mom\u2019s death, and it was too thin, too weak, too brittle to hold up to the fissures.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lunged forward\u2014and it was the same exact hug, warm without being suffocating, tight and firm and <em>protective</em>, and Jason buried his head into Robin\u2019s costume and shook as the tears dripped down his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jason choked on the sob, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me, <em>please</em>\u2014\u201d he couldn\u2019t go back to the cold apartment after this, not after seeing <em>what could\u2019ve been</em>\u2014\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me go\u2014\u201d oh <em>no</em>, what if Batman called CPS?\u00a0 What if Robin <em>let him</em> take Jason away\u2014even though Dick <em>knew</em> what the system was like, Jason had seen it in his eyes, what if Robin would leave Jason there because why would he want to be brothers with some random kid from Crime Alley\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Never</em>,\u201d Robin\u2014Dick said, murmuring the words into his hair, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving you.\u00a0 You\u2019re my brother now, and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shuddered, and the tears fell faster, but this time they tasted like relief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick rocked him gently, a gloved hand softly stroking through his hair, and started singing a quiet melody.\u00a0 Jason still couldn\u2019t understand the words, but he memorized the sounds of them as he held onto his new big brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a rustle of the cape and Jason darted a glance up, his stomach twisting\u2014Robin wanted him, but Batman could still send him away, could still\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A heavy cape dropped around his shoulders, draping him in warmth, and Jason felt his limbs relax as he curled closer to Dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>In another dimension\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just <em>con</em> me into getting adopted?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know there were, like, a hundred ways you could\u2019ve alerted Bruce without having Jason steal the tires.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was feeling sentimental, sue me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were injured, Richard, you should not have exerted yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t Bruce always warning us of the consequences of meddling in other dimensions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just <em>leave</em> poor little Jaybird all alone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou call me <em>poor little Jaybird</em> one more time, and I\u2019ll cut your vocal cords.\u00a0 And if you liked the little brat so much, you should\u2019ve stayed with him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s <em>jealous</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing envious of your own younger self is pitiful and illogical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Little Wing, no, I wanted to help out the kid but <em>you\u2019re</em> my little brother!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off me\u2014I don\u2019t want a hug\u2014Dick, <em>you asshole</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim scrambled to the edge of the rooftop and set his camera up with fumbling fingers.\u00a0 It was just starting to get cold outside, and he rubbed his gloved hands fiercely before crouching behind the small ledge and peering through the camera lens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had a beautiful view of downtown Gotham, almost-full moon just rising above the skyscrapers and looming over the twinkling lights of the city.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t be able to spot Batman like this, and Robin would blend in with all the colors, but he took a few pictures of the scenic skyline and waited for the sight of a grapple line extending between buildings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a <em>new</em> Robin\u2014the costume had changed only slightly, but this Robin was smaller and stockier, and Batman had been joined by a slender figure in blue and black that called himself Nightwing.\u00a0 Tim had been so excited\u2014he\u2019d been wondering if Jason would ever take a vigilante role, but it made sense that they wanted to wait until he was a little older.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was fascinated with the shift in their patrols\u2014Robin II made a point of swinging by Crime Alley and checking up on the street kids and the sex workers and while he wasn\u2019t as cheerful and energetic as Dick Grayson, he had an unfailing ability to make people smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim felt proud that he got to watch Jason\u2019s debut.\u00a0 <em>And</em> that he\u2019d been doing this longer than the second Robin\u2014maybe he\u2019d take the chance to get a little closer to Jason, to tell this Robin all the things he\u2019d been far too intimidated to tell the first Robin, the secrets and gossip and hints he picked out climbing all over the city streets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because Jason <em>got</em> it.\u00a0 He understood what the streets were like.\u00a0 And Tim was so happy that Jason got a family\u2014the <em>best</em> family\u2014and Tim ruthlessly suppressed that train of thought before it could lead somewhere he didn\u2019t want it to go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes\u2014just sometimes\u2014he wondered what it would be like to be Bruce Wayne\u2019s kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that was just a stupid daydream.\u00a0 Batman had better things to do than babysit a ten-year-old, and besides, Tim was fine on his own.\u00a0 Case in point, he\u2019d been walking the streets of Gotham at night for a <em>year</em> now, without a grapple line or fancy costumes or a Batmobile, and he hadn\u2019t even been mugged <em>once</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d picked up some self-defense moves, and he had a can of pepper spray, and he was careful.\u00a0 Maybe Robin would even be impressed, and teach him some tricks\u2014like how they managed to scale buildings without a grapple, Tim was very interested in learning that, not all the buildings had fire escapes and there was one in particular that had a <em>great</em> view of the docks\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a loud crackle, like a static shock, and then what sounded like fingernails dragging down chalkboard.\u00a0 Tim had to step away from his camera and clap his hands to his ears as the awful sound grated in his bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It ended as suddenly as it had started, and Tim warily peeked over the ledge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Loud grumbling, a sudden exclamation\u2014<em>bang bang bang</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim watched, frozen to the spot, as a man slowly collapsed to the floor.\u00a0 The other figure, a guy almost as big as Batman with a modified red helmet, lowered his gun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guy was dead.\u00a0 Just like that.\u00a0 Between one instant and the next, he had three bullet wounds, body still and crumpled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPiece of shit,\u201d Red Helmet snarled, \u201cI should\u2019ve cut off your hands first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim didn\u2019t know what he did, but he must\u2019ve made some sort of sound, because Red Helmet\u2019s face snapped up, white-eyed gaze locking on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh <em>crap</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim yanked away from the ledge, grabbing his camera and hurriedly packing it away\u2014any moment now, he was going to hear the guy trying to scale up the building, or shoot at him, or\u2014or\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim needed to get away, he needed to hide\u2014maybe he\u2019d find a convenient dumpster, he\u2019d done it before, and lay there quietly until Red Helmet forgot about him.\u00a0 The guy couldn\u2019t have gotten a good look at him, and Tim was wearing a dark hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He scrambled down the fire escape, trying to be quiet, hoping that Red Helmet hadn\u2019t rounded the building yet\u2014maybe Tim had spooked him, maybe he\u2019d run.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t want to be caught red-handed at the scene of a murder.\u00a0 He probably didn\u2019t even know that Tim was a kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim let go of the last level of the fire escape and absorbed the impact by bending his knees, not bothering to use the ladder\u2014turn into the next street and find a dumpster?\u00a0 Hide in a corner?\u00a0 Or use the one right in front of him, five steps away\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d a distorted voice said behind him, \u201cOr I shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d the voice demanded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His heart was racing, banging frantically on his ribs like it was demanding to be allowed to escape before he got shot.\u00a0 Tim slowly raised his hands, his skin prickling, and shuffled around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Helmet had a gun in his hand, but it was pointing at the floor.\u00a0 Tim kept his hands up, just in case.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your backpack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wished that his can of pepper spray wasn\u2019t in his pocket, too far to reach\u2014not that it would\u2019ve been all that effective, this guy had a full-face helmet.\u00a0 He slowly slipped the backpack off of his shoulders, careful not to make any sudden movements, but before he could hold it out, Red Helmet stalked forward and grabbed it out of his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He crouched to examine its contents, gun still in one hand, and Tim warily shifted on the balls of his feet.\u00a0 He could maybe make a run for it while the guy was distracted\u2014he\u2019d have to leave the camera behind, but that was already a lost cause, he might as well save himself\u2014but Red Helmet straightened with the camera in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim desperately tried to remember if he had anything incriminating on it.\u00a0 He\u2019d taken only skyline shots today and yesterday\u2014but the day before that, he\u2019d gotten an amazing photo of Robin and Batman on the rooftop of the police station, and before that he\u2019d heard some guys talking and had taken careful pictures of the faces of a gang of drug dealers standing around a map.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d taken those photos for printing and deleted them from the memory card, and he\u2019d done that <em>before</em> he\u2019d gone to the police station, so the earliest pictures on the camera should be from the day before yesterday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Helmet\u2019s gloved fingers tightened on the camera.\u00a0 Tim swallowed as he raised the gun, but he holstered it instead of waving it in Tim\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Tim could take advantage of this opportunity and <em>run</em>, Red Helmet stepped forward and grabbed his chin, yanking the hood off and tilting Tim\u2019s face up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stopped breathing.\u00a0 The grip on his jaw was immovable, and all he could do was stare into the white lenses of the red helmet.\u00a0 His limbs were beginning to tremble.\u00a0 He could feel his eyes prickling.\u00a0 That grip just had to shift a little lower to choke him out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Helmet let go and took a step back.\u00a0 \u201cHuh,\u201d he said, scanning both ends of the alleyway before glancing down at his wrist and a weird, oddly-shaped watch that didn\u2019t seem to match the rest of his leather-jacket-guns-armor ensemble.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Red Helmet repeated, in the tone of voice that suggested that he\u2019d meant to substitute a stronger word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim begged his legs to unfreeze.\u00a0 He needed to run\u2014Red Helmet wasn\u2019t looking at him, wasn\u2019t pointing the gun at him, <em>this was his chance\u2014</em>but his body refused to so much as twitch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Helmet looked back at the camera, picked the backpack up, and offered both back to Tim.\u00a0 Tim took them with trembling fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis city isn\u2019t safe at night,\u201d Red Helmet said, slowly and precisely, \u201cGo home, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim clutched the backpack and camera close.\u00a0 He still couldn\u2019t move his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice pictures, though,\u201d Red Helmet said offhandedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinked.\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d he said, his voice almost turning into a squeak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Red Helmet said easily, \u201cYou\u2019ve got an eye, kid.\u00a0 That picture of Batman and Robin?\u00a0 Without them realizing?\u00a0 That takes some skills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tim mumbled, packing his camera back into his bag.\u00a0 His ears were hot.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t shown his pictures to anyone before\u2014well, the GCPD didn\u2019t count, and neither did the small portfolio Tim created for his parents to show him that he wasn\u2019t wasting his time with photography, a portfolio that he\u2019d labored over for <em>hours</em>, and finally received a perfunctory nod before his parents left again\u2014and it felt nice.\u00a0 To get some praise.\u00a0 Even if it <em>was</em> from a murderer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Helmet was walking away.\u00a0 \u201cGo home, kid,\u201d he called out over his shoulder, \u201cYou can take photos in daylight too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim let out a shaky exhale as Red Helmet finally disappeared from sight, his heart rate slowly starting to decrease.\u00a0 His legs felt like limp noodles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t gotten shot, he hadn\u2019t gotten his camera stolen or smashed\u2014he\u2019d gotten the scare of his life, but Tim and his things were in one piece.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared curiously in the direction Red Helmet had gone as he pulled his backpack back on.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t heard of a Rogue or a vigilante with a bright red helmet before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim had scoped out this fire escape a week ago\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything special, and it was a good two blocks away from the shore, but because of the way the streets were laid out, if Tim crouched on the third level of the fire escape, he could see a sliver between two buildings and the ocean beyond it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the full moon rising, it shot a streak of white-yellow across the dark patch of waves, and Tim fiddled with his camera before he took another shot.\u00a0 It was beautiful, like peeking through a keyhole to see a new world, and Tim adjusted the lens again before taking another shot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The quiet <em>click</em> of the camera didn\u2019t quite hide the muffled clang of boots landing on the railing behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no other sounds, even though Tim <em>knew</em> he\u2019d heard someone.\u00a0 Not even the creak of metal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim bit his lip, hard, and slowly turned around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leather jacket, guns, red helmet with eerie, glowing white eyes.\u00a0 \u201cHello,\u201d Red Helmet said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wasn\u2019t sure what sound he made, but he definitely banged his head against the railing as he scrambled up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, kid, I\u2019m not going to eat you,\u201d Red Helmet drawled, hopping off the railing and into Tim\u2019s personal space because three feet was <em>way</em> too close to a guy who had that many guns.\u00a0 \u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stared at him.\u00a0 Red Helmet stared back, and Tim realized he was waiting for an <em>answer</em>.\u00a0 \u201cT-taking pictures,\u201d he squeaked out, still pressed back against the railing, his fingers tight on his camera.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf what?\u201d\u00a0 Red Helmet sounded genuinely bewildered as he observed the surrounding area\u2014all old buildings, slowly crumbling apart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u00a0 The ocean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can see the ocean from here?\u201d Red Helmet asked, incredulous, tilting his head as if that would make him see better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim swallowed, and pointed to the bars of the railing\u2014and stumbled back, pressing into the corner, as Red Helmet stepped forward and crouched to see through the bars.\u00a0 \u201cWow,\u201d he said, the distorted voice quiet, \u201cAll these years, and I\u2019ve never seen this.\u201d\u00a0 He stayed there, squatting, for a little while longer.\u00a0 \u201cMust be some stunning pictures, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stepped away from the railing and straightened.\u00a0 Up and up and up, because he was nearly as tall as <em>Batman</em>, and Tim was just a kid in a too-big hoodie, trying to look older than he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s knees were knocking together, the camera biting painfully into his fingers.\u00a0 Red Helmet stared down at him, and released a loud sigh.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not going to attack you, kid,\u201d he grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Red Hood,\u201d Tim stuttered, and the man went eerily still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from those soulless white lenses, he felt like he was stuck in place and he couldn\u2019t even <em>scream</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you hear that name?\u201d Hood asked, cold and level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim had gone home yesterday and done his research.\u00a0 Red helmet had only ever meant one thing in Gotham, and the Red Hood gang may have been dead and gone, but the Joker was still alive and kicking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I looked it up,\u201d Tim swallowed as friendliness leaked out of the man\u2019s posture, turning into something more militant.\u00a0 \u201cYour\u2014your helmet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of me because I\u2019m wearing a helmet?\u201d the man asked, but his chuckle was unamused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, Tim shouted inside his head, <em>I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s bleached skin behind that helmet</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Red Hood,\u201d Tim said slowly, \u201cBecame the Joker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man locked up like Tim had tased him, a low, growling hiss cracking through the voice distorter, and Tim\u2019s legs finally, <em>finally</em> unfroze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was closer to the stairs, and he took them at a leap, crashing down to the next level and hugging his camera to his chest as he scrambled for the remaining steps.\u00a0 Metal creaked above him, and Tim hurriedly pushed against the ladder, fumbling down it one handed, and letting go before he was all the way down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His knees slammed into asphalt with stinging aches, and Tim hissed at the scrapes on his palms before he lurched back up to his feet.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t glance behind him, didn\u2019t check to see how close Hood was, or if he was gaining, or if he\u2019d taken off that red helmet and begun to laugh.\u00a0 Tim just <em>ran</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The maze of alleyways that made up East-End-Crime-Alley-Bowery was difficult enough to navigate in broad daylight, where absent glances were needed to figure out which alleyways to risk and which to avoid.\u00a0 Unfortunately for Tim, it was the middle of the night, and even the rising full moon wasn\u2019t enough light to see all the monsters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim yelped as he accidently plowed into the back of someone\u2019s legs, landing hard on his side and only allowing himself a moment to be stunned before pushing himself back up.\u00a0 The conversation in front of him cut off as the man he\u2019d bumped into righted himself and turned around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was breathing heavily, his chest squeezing painfully and his fingers shaking.\u00a0 There was a whole gang of them, all staring at Tim, and he hastily backed up a step as their gazes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s just a kid,\u201d someone snorted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going,\u201d the man in the front sneered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim bobbed his head, backing up another step.\u00a0 \u201cS\u2014sorry,\u201d he whispered, clutching his camera to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d the man at the back called out, his narrowed eyes fixed on Tim, \u201cDidn\u2019t Davis say something about a shrimp hanging around their last meeting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim swallowed, and backed up another step as the gang spread out.\u00a0 Shadows played across their faces, but one of them looked very familiar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scar across left cheek, ragged beard, fearsome frown\u2014one of the men Tim had clicked a picture of half a week ago, in the middle of a drug deal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be,\u201d another man said, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim inched back another step.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t be more than a few feet from the alley entrance, if he makes a run for it\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a camera,\u201d hissed someone from the back, and they all fell silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tension ratcheted up.\u00a0 Tim twisted on a heel, lunging for the street, <em>this was bad, this was very, very bad\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And choked as the collar of his hoodie snapped tight across his throat, effectively strangling him as they dragged him back by the hood.\u00a0 \u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Tim tried to scream, but he didn\u2019t have the breath, and he tripped as they threw him down, landing painfully on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little snitch,\u201d Scarface sneered, and Tim wanted to deny it, wanted to shout, wanted to\u2014a foot slammed into his stomach and he wheezed, unable to breathe.\u00a0 \u201cThought you\u2019d try playing at being a cop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another kick, and Tim tried to curl up, but his legs were yanked away from him and someone tore the camera from his trembling fingers.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Stop</em>,\u201d Tim gasped, and choked when the next kick collided with his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot some pictures of Batman and Robin too,\u201d someone jeered.\u00a0 A hand tightened around his throat and hauled him up\u2014Tim frantically clawed at the grip, but he couldn\u2019t stop them from slamming him against the alley wall, and his head cracked painfully against the brick.\u00a0 Nausea surged as bursts of light clouded his vision and Tim scraped his fingernails across the arm holding him in place as he struggled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou one of those Bat fans, kid?\u00a0 You think they\u2019re going to come and save you?\u201d the man in front of him laughed, and Tim saw his fist stretch back through blurred vision.\u00a0 That was going to hit him.\u00a0 That was going to smash into his <em>face</em>, and Tim couldn\u2019t stop it, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <em>bang</em> of a gunshot was almost unreal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man holding him <em>howled</em> and jerked back, letting go of Tim.\u00a0 Tim slid-scraped down the wall, his knees crumpling beneath him, and curled up into as small a ball as he could as shouts and screams and gunshots echoed in the air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d someone screamed as a bullet <em>ding</em>ed off the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone who hates watching kids get hurt,\u201d a deep, furious, mechanized voice answered, and Tim trembled as he clutched his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gunshots stopped, and silence fell abnormally fast.\u00a0 Suddenly, Tim\u2019s quiet sniffles were the loudest sound around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quiet footsteps, nearing him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid?\u201d the distorted voice called out, \u201cKid, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim couldn\u2019t stop shivering, even as he slowly twisted his head enough to catch a glimpse of red.\u00a0 Hood was crouching next to him, gun lowered, watching him silently.\u00a0 Around him, Tim could see unmoving limbs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid?\u201d Hood called again, the distorted voice sounding almost\u2026concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim uncurled, and lunged forward, crashing into armor that was harder than he expected.\u00a0 He gasped as the breath was forced from his stuttering lungs, but he didn\u2019t let go, gripping harder at cracked noise of surprise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His stomach was cramping painfully and <em>everything</em> was trembling and he couldn\u2019t breathe properly\u2014those men had been planning to hurt him\u2014those men were <em>dead</em> \u2014he buried his face against the leather jacket, cheeks wet and freezing\u2014he\u2019d never been more terrified in his life, and that included the time that he fell two stories off the roof and lay in a bush, winded and paralyzed and <em>alone</em>, for what felt like an eternity before he managed to roll over and get back up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Hood said softly, \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you again, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0 A hand settled on his back and slowly patted him.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re safe, kid, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim hung onto him\u2014onto the Red Hood\u2014onto the <em>murderer\u2014</em>and Hood let him, not commenting on Tim\u2019s sniffles, or the tears on his leather jacket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, someone may be coming to investigate the commotion,\u201d Hood said slowly.\u00a0 Tim stiffened as Hood wrapped his arms around him, and lifted as he straightened\u2014he was holding Tim easily, like he was a toddler instead of <em>ten</em>, but Tim didn\u2019t think his legs were up to cooperating right now, so he allowed it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood carried him back to the street and to a different alleyway, a minute\u2019s walk away.\u00a0 He placed Tim on top of a closed dumpster and stepped back to observe him as Tim scrubbed at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim kept one arm curled around his stomach, and didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0 The tears kept falling, no matter how hard he tried to wipe them away, and his breaths were turning into hitched gasps again.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Hood said, \u201cKid\u2014what\u2019s your name?\u00a0 You can call me Hood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJ\u2014Jack,\u201d Tim forced out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood snorted, and Tim stared at him as he stepped closer.\u00a0 \u201cSorry,\u201d Hood said, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014I have a brother named Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0 Tim tried to curl up further, but Hood was in front of him again, tugging at Tim\u2019s arm and pressing carefully at Tim\u2019s ribs and stomach.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s breath caught several times, and he made a pained hiss when Hood\u2019s fingers drifted over a growing bruise, but nothing felt <em>really</em> bad.\u00a0 Hood stepped even closer, gloved hands skimming over the back of Tim\u2019s head, where he\u2019d cracked it against the wall, before stepping back, apparently satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing looks broken, Jack,\u201d Hood said, \u201cBut I can still take you to Doc Thompkins\u2019 clinic if you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone who knew Dr. Leslie Thompkins couldn\u2019t be a <em>real</em> bad guy, right?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m f-fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Hood nodded, before his shoulders hunched up, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for scaring you earlier, kid.\u00a0 You just caught me off guard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim considered him.\u00a0 And remembered the growl.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t like the Joker,\u201d Tim deduced, curling slightly in case Hood reacted badly again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood barked out a laugh, \u201cYou can say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why,\u201d Tim asked quietly, \u201cAre you using his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood considered him for a long moment.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d he said finally, \u201cBut the short answer is that he stole a name from me.\u00a0 So I decided to do the same to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim bobbed his head.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know what the Joker had stolen from Hood, but the logic made sense.\u00a0 Hood took a deep breath, before letting it out again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you this city\u2019s not safe at night,\u201d Hood grumbled, \u201cYour pictures really worth it, Jack?\u201d\u00a0 He had Tim\u2019s camera in his hand, and it was half smashed and covered in blood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim scowled at him.\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d he said vehemently, which seemed to shock Hood.\u00a0 Tim didn\u2019t just take pictures of the ocean, he took pictures of things that helped the GCPD, that helped Batman and Robin, and he wasn\u2019t going to <em>stop</em> because bad people were mad at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood shook his head and chuckled.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t even know why I tried,\u201d he muttered quietly, before handing the camera back to Tim.\u00a0 \u201cGo home,\u201d he instructed, \u201cTake a hot shower.\u00a0 Get some ice packs if your stomach still hurts, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim nodded, hopping of the dumpster.\u00a0 His knees ached and he still felt a little sick, but the churning sea of panic had receded.\u00a0 \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, kiddo,\u201d Red Hood ruffled his hair before letting Tim pass him to get back to the street.\u00a0 \u201cStay out of trouble,\u201d he called after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last sight Tim had of him was Hood staring at the watch on his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camera was ruined.\u00a0 The data card was salvageable, but nothing else, and Tim needed to plan carefully if he wanted to obtain a new camera.\u00a0 For now, he grabbed the disposable camera he\u2019d gotten a long time ago, and the police scanner he\u2019d constructed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The contrast on the disposable camera wasn\u2019t high enough to grab any decent pictures of Batman and Robin, but it would be enough to get some decent shots of any illicit activity.\u00a0 The police scanner would give him some opportunities, and Tim walked near Robinson Park, tuning the radio and listening carefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJack!\u201d Tim whirled around, and saw Hood on the other side of the street.\u00a0 He warily glanced around the empty streets before jogging over to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOut again?\u201d Hood asked, when Tim was closer, helmet dipping down to observe the much smaller camera Tim was clutching.\u00a0 \u201cYou really don\u2019t know how to quit, do you kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like taking photos,\u201d Tim retorted, narrowing his eyes\u2014why was Hood <em>stalking</em> him?\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t <em>you</em> have anything better to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood barked out a half-laugh and muttered something that sounded like <em>\u2018a little shit in every universe\u2019</em>.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m waiting on my ride,\u201d he said, staring at the blocky watch again, \u201cShouldn\u2019t be too long.\u00a0 I\u2019ll probably be gone by tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGone from\u2026Gotham?\u00a0 You\u2019re not from here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Hood said, something amused in his tone, \u201cJust got stranded here for a couple of days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huh.\u00a0 Hadn\u2019t he said something about living here?\u00a0 And he knew the Joker.\u00a0 Tim had the creeping sense that he wasn\u2019t getting the full story\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The police radio crackled, and Tim turned his attention to it, tuning the dials as the scratchy whine resolved into broken words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Hood asked, curious, and Tim shushed him, carefully turning the dial until\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014Arkham breakout\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014Amusement Mile\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014careful\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014Batsignal\u2019s lit\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim turned, along with Hood, and they could see the shadow of the bat against the cloudy sky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThe Joker\u2019s escaped.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The radio was snatched out of his hand.\u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d Tim said automatically, twisting, but Hood backed away, radio in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Hood said, his voice coming out strange and flat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>mine</em>,\u201d Tim snapped, stepping forward but Hood jerked back, his body tense and not at all friendly.\u00a0 He grabbed Tim\u2019s hand before Tim could make another lunge for the radio, and his grip was <em>tight</em>.\u00a0 Bordering on painful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo <em>home</em>,\u201d Hood snarled, and that was rage in his tone, easily identifiable, \u201cThis isn\u2019t some two-bit drug dealer, kid.\u00a0 It\u2019s the <em>Joker</em>.\u00a0 Go back to your house, lock all the doors, and <em>don\u2019t leave</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d Tim said\u2014he meant to snap, but his voice ended up cracking as Hood loomed over him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hood chuckled, unamused, \u201cI thought that too.\u201d\u00a0 He let go of Tim\u2019s hand, sending him stumbling back, and Tim warily edged a step back as Hood stared at him.\u00a0 \u201cYou have two options, kid,\u201d Hood said, mechanized tone dark and dangerous, \u201cEither you go home and <em>stay home</em>, or I\u2019m going to tie you up and hide you in a hole.\u00a0 Your choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim edged back another step.\u00a0 He remembered the gunshots, the easy, casual way Hood murdered an alley full of people.\u00a0 The <em>blood</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d Hood said.\u00a0 Tim stumbled back, unwilling to take his eyes off of Hood, and the red helmet watched him dispassionately.\u00a0 The police radio still crackled out updates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim could feel eyes on him all the way home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim couldn\u2019t go to sleep.\u00a0 He\u2019d stayed on his laptop as the clock ticked on\u2014no news of the Joker\u2019s capture.\u00a0 No news of Batman.\u00a0 <em>No news</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should go back out.\u00a0 Find Batman and Robin.\u00a0 Confirm that they were safe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thought back to Hood\u2019s half-order-half-threat, and shivered.\u00a0 The Red Hood had a strange way of running into him, and Tim didn\u2019t want to cross him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim sighed and flopped back on his bed.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t like <em>waiting</em>.\u00a0 It was the reason he\u2019d taken to the streets in the first place\u2014reading news articles and forum posts was interesting, but he needed <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He contemplated the ceiling\u2014if only he had his police scanner, if only he <em>knew</em> what was going on\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He almost didn\u2019t register the sound of his window sliding open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was odd.\u00a0 It was entirely unexpected.\u00a0 He lived in <em>Bristol</em>, they had a <em>gate</em>, he\u2019d disabled the alarms on his window a year ago and now he was watching the Red Hood slip inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>What</em>, was all his mind was capable of handling.\u00a0 What was\u2014<em>how did</em>\u2014Tim didn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood turned, and saw him staring.\u00a0 He was covered in blood\u2014it gleamed sickly against the dark armor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Tim,\u201d the mechanized voice greeted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2014Tim hadn\u2019t given him his real name.\u00a0 His <em>address</em>.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t\u2014what was Hood\u2014Tim realized that he needed to get <em>away</em> when Hood reached the edge of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there was nowhere to get away <em>to</em>, a fact Tim only realized after he backed himself into the corner.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2014what are you <em>doing</em> here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood checked his watch again.\u00a0 \u201cI wish I could explain,\u201d Hood said slowly, \u201cBut I\u2019m running out of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain <em>what</em>?\u00a0 And why are you covered in blood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, kid,\u201d Hood said, \u201cI really don\u2019t have the time.\u00a0 Are we doing this the easy way or the hard way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoing <em>what</em>?\u201d Tim almost shouted, his gaze darting around the room\u2014the phone was too far away, there was nothing he could use as a weapon, his fists weren\u2019t going to cut it against Hood\u2019s armor, and dread was sinking in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gone a whole <em>year</em> without any problems.\u00a0 He\u2014he\u2014he was being cornered in his <em>bedroom</em> by a man twice his size, a man who\u2019d already shown that he was capable of murder in cold blood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Hood held out a hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI went back home,\u201d Tim said, mouth dry, \u201cLike you told me to.\u201d\u00a0 <em>\u201cI\u2019m going to tie you up and hide you in a hole.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood huffed out an unamused chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, Tim,\u201d Hood said, waggling his fingers, \u201cWe <em>literally</em> do not have time for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How did Hood <em>know his name</em>?\u00a0 How long had he been watching Tim?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Tim asked, stalling but having no clue what he was stalling for.\u00a0 No one was going to hear him if he screamed.\u00a0 No one was going to check on him for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHome,\u201d Hood said simply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis <em>is</em> home,\u201d Tim tried, wondering if Hood was supposed to be in Arkham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood laughed.\u00a0 \u201cThis?\u201d he chuckled, waving his hand at the room around them, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a home, kid, it\u2019s a mausoleum.\u201d\u00a0 Tim made a sound of protest, and Hood dropped the hand, advancing, \u201cReally?\u00a0 Going tell me that the hallways aren\u2019t full of worthless trophies?\u00a0 Going to tell me that your parents aren\u2019t gone?\u201d\u00a0 Tim\u2019s blood ran cold.\u00a0 \u201cDo you even know where they are right now?\u00a0 Do you know when they\u2019re coming back?\u00a0 Do you realize that normal parents don\u2019t leave their kids unsupervised for <em>months</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim couldn\u2019t speak.\u00a0 Tim couldn\u2019t <em>move</em>.\u00a0 How\u2014how did he <em>know</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of time, kid,\u201d Hood said, and he was only three steps away, \u201cGuess we\u2019re doing this the hard way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>No</em>\u2014Tim tried to run, but Hood caught him, an arm slamming into his stomach and a hand catching his right wrist.\u00a0 Hood pulled back, grabbing his left arm as well, and Tim <em>screamed</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no point.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one could hear him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hard plastic locked around his wrists, chaining his arms behind his back, and Tim kept screaming, trying to kick out as he thrashed in Hood\u2019s grip.\u00a0 A boot in the back of his knees forced him to fall forward, unbalanced, and a knee digging into his back kept him on the ground as he writhed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another ziptie tightened around his ankles, locking his feet together.\u00a0 Tim rubbed his ankles against each other, but the tie caught against bone, refusing to slip past.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this,\u201d Hood said.\u00a0 Tim tried to suck in a breath, tried to come up with words\u2014<em>please don\u2019t do this</em>\u2014but there was a ripping noise and Hood grabbed his jaw, forcing his mouth closed and taping over it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s screams turned to muffled sobs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d Hood repeated, finally getting off Tim.\u00a0 Tim managed to get enough momentum to roll over, his wrists pressing painfully against his back as he stared up at Hood.\u00a0 At the expressionless red helmet.\u00a0 At the <em>blood</em>\u2014the blood that surely couldn\u2019t be his, there was too much of it, and it was splattered <em>everywhere</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s breathing ticked up, drawing faster, frantic breaths through his nose as he tried to scream through the tape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is for your own good,\u201d Hood informed him.\u00a0 Tim tried to kick him as he got closer, but the angle was too awkward, and Hood just caught his legs and hauled him up, throwing him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim struggled\u2014even the painful drop to the floor six feet below was better than whatever Hood wanted to do to him\u2014but Hood had an arm wrapped around the back of his knees, too tight to allow much movement.\u00a0 Hood moved easily through the house, clearly unconcerned about getting caught, and Tim tried screaming again when he walked out the front door, making muffled whines through the tape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Hood didn\u2019t go for the gates, or a car.\u00a0 He kept walking, heading for the woods at the edge of the property, and Tim fought <em>harder</em>\u2014there was no good reason for a bloodstained murderer to be carrying him into the woods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was useless.\u00a0 Hood was too strong to fight against, and Tim couldn\u2019t keep up his struggles.\u00a0 Fatigue crept through his muscles as Hood kept walking, and Tim was forced to go limp, tears streaking off his face to land on the ground.\u00a0 All he could do was imagine a myriad of horrible futures\u2014and he hadn\u2019t even been on the streets, he\u2019d been at <em>home</em>, home was supposed to be <em>safe</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood stopped, and there was a beeping noise, like he was entering something into a keypad.\u00a0 Tim sniffled\u2014all he could see was Hood\u2019s legs and the dirt.\u00a0 He blinked furiously, but the tears kept coming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something grated, steel scraping across stone, and Hood was walking again.\u00a0 Tim tried a muffled scream, but it was useless, and he felt a shiver run down his spine as the moonlight disappeared to darkness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh god.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where was Hood <em>taking</em> him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man stayed perfectly silent, boots near-silent against the stone, and the darkness gave way to light again.\u00a0 Tim could see snatches of walls and desks\u2014he tried to crane his neck up, to see where he was, but his neck ached and he had to drop it after only catching a glimpse of what looked like a giant penny.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More beeping.\u00a0 This time, the door opened with a <em>hiss</em> of unsealing.\u00a0 Hood shifted his grip, and Tim widened his eyes in surprise as Hood shrugged him off, settling him on a smooth floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Glass walls.\u00a0 Hood stepped back.\u00a0 Glass <em>door</em> clicking shut.\u00a0 He\u2014he was in a cave?\u00a0 Fluorescent lights illuminated a desk full of monitors, a gym, a <em>dinosaur</em>\u2014and Hood was walking away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Hood called over his shoulder, <em>leaving</em> him, \u201cRemember to be good, Timmy.\u00a0 And stop sneaking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaving him, in a cell, in a <em>cage</em>, in a large, abandoned cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim tried to shout, but the sharpest sound he could make was a high-pitched whine, and Hood didn\u2019t turn.\u00a0 His wrists were still tied behind him, as were his ankles, and he shuffled forward on his knees, driving his shoulder into the glass door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t open.\u00a0 He tried again, <em>harder</em>, and again, until his shoulder was throbbing painfully, but the door didn\u2019t budge and the glass didn\u2019t break.\u00a0 He tried to shriek.\u00a0 He tried to get up.\u00a0 He tried to break the door with his other shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A sizzling sound.\u00a0 Nails <em>screech</em>ing down chalkboard.\u00a0 Hood disappeared between one blink and the next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cave was empty.\u00a0 Tim was all alone, and no one was coming for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pressed his face to the glass, tape tight across his lips, and <em>screamed</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know how long it\u2019d been before he heard voices.\u00a0 How long he\u2019d spent, curled up, sobbing furiously but silently, pressed against the glass door in the faint, illogical hope that it would release.\u00a0 How long before he heard footsteps and exclamations and dully realized that they weren\u2019t inside his own head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How long before he raised his head, in growing hope and terror, to see\u2014a cowled shadow and a brightly-colored boy almost bouncing next to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stared at them, frozen in shock for a long, stretching moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2014they\u2019d come to save him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shouted\u2014or tried to, forcing out as loud a sound as possible through the tape.\u00a0 Batman and Robin stilled, their gazes snapping his way, and Tim made a muffled shout again, banging against the glass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin moved first\u2014he was cursing, and he practically slammed a code in before wrenching open the door and catching Tim before he could faceplant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Robin\u2014<em>Jason</em> said, peeling the tape off his mouth, \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, we got you.\u201d\u00a0 Tim wanted to form words\u2014to tell them about Hood, to say <em>thank you</em>, to do <em>something</em> other than sob, half-curled into Jason\u2019s chest as the older boy fumbled with the zipties before slicing them off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim yanked his wrists free as soon as he was able to, and clutched Jason tightly\u2014he couldn\u2019t go, he couldn\u2019t leave, <em>people kept leaving him and Tim couldn\u2019t</em>\u2014and Jason murmured low, soothing reassurances as he gently patted Tim\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jason said quietly, letting him cry into the front of his suit, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe now.\u201d\u00a0 Tim <em>knew</em> that, and he cried even <em>harder</em>\u2014it felt like the dread had been scooped out of him, and taken all his self-control with it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s cape rustled nearby, and the sense of protection swelled\u2014Tim turned enough to watch him examine the cell, looking for anything out of place.\u00a0 \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim took a fresh glance at his surroundings.\u00a0 Computer set up.\u00a0 Gym.\u00a0 Cases\u2026of older Robin and Batman uniforms.\u00a0 A ten-minute walk from his house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was Batman\u2019s secret hideout.\u00a0 They were <em>under Wayne Manor</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman finished his examination and turned to Tim.\u00a0 \u201cB,\u201d Jason said in a low, warning tone, holding Tim tighter, but Batman just crouched in front of them, a safe distance away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Batman asked, quiet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cT\u2014Tim Drake.\u201d\u00a0 Batman was supposed to be scary but here, wrapped up in Robin\u2019s embrace, Tim had never felt safer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened, Tim?\u201d Batman asked, still quiet.\u00a0 Patient.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, can we save the interrogation\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pushed upright, resettling against Jason, because\u2014because if this was Batman\u2019s hideout, then they needed to know.\u00a0 It\u2014it was compromised, and they needed to know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I was taken,\u201d Tim said, his voice hoarse, \u201cFrom my bedroom.\u00a0 B\u2014by Hood.\u00a0 He\u2014he brought me here and l\u2014locked\u2014\u201d Tim couldn\u2019t even look at the cell, and Jason made a quiet sound and shifted back, until they were facing away from it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHood?\u201d Batman prompted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Red Hood,\u201d Tim sniffled.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s arms tightened.\u00a0 Batman went very still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>Joker</em> knows how to get into the Cave?!\u201d Jason squawked in horror, and Tim was already shaking his head by the time Batman spoke up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Joker is dead,\u201d Batman said quietly, \u201cTim, can you describe the Red Hood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014he was big.\u00a0 A\u2014almost as big as you.\u00a0 Red helmet.\u00a0 Leather jacket.\u00a0 G\u2014guns.\u00a0 He had a red bat on his armor.\u201d\u00a0 Jason made another vehement noise.\u00a0 \u201cHe was\u2014he was covered in blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman made a thoughtful noise.\u00a0 \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pointed in the general direction they\u2019d come from.\u00a0 \u201cA tunnel in the woods.\u00a0 He knew the codes.\u201d\u00a0 He remembered the strangeness of Hood\u2019s departure.\u00a0 \u201cA\u2014and he <em>disappeared</em>.\u201d\u00a0 Tim waved to the last location he\u2019d seen Hood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman straightened fluidly and stalked off in that direction.\u00a0 Tim let himself stay in Robin\u2019s arms as Jason patted his back, reassuring him that he was safe now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTime magic,\u201d Batman called back gruffly, \u201cDimensional.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jason replied, \u201cBut that description doesn\u2019t match\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u00a0 A second traveler.\u00a0 Same dimension, if this is calibrated correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Jason said.\u00a0 And then, looking down at Tim, \u201c<em>Huh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman walked back over to them.\u00a0 \u201cRisk of secondary infiltration low, but I will be running a sweep of the Batcave.\u201d\u00a0 The <em>Batcave</em>.\u00a0 Tim couldn\u2019t believe they actually called it that.\u00a0 Jason smiled at Tim\u2019s snort, and Batman crouched down again.\u00a0 \u201cDid the Red Hood hurt you, Tim?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim thought about it for a moment\u2014his mouth was still tingling from the tape, and his wrists hurt, but that was arguably more due to his struggling than due to Hood, and Hood\u2026hadn\u2019t actually hurt him.\u00a0 He\u2019d just kidnapped him.\u00a0 And put him in the <em>Batcave</em>.\u00a0 Surely he would\u2019ve known that Batman and Robin would come back?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he\u2019d kept <em>apologizing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tim shook his head.\u00a0 He\u2019d been terrified, but not injured.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, Tim,\u201d Jason said, rubbing his back, \u201cWe\u2019ll get some restorative hot chocolate before any more questions, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nodded, \u201cThanks, Jason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s arms went rigid as he froze.\u00a0 The tension around Tim skyrocketed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Jason asked flatly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh <em>no</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim tore himself out of Jason\u2019s arms\u2014trying to straighten up, but stumbling and ending up crawling back, shivering as Robin stared at him with a blank expression, white lenses fixed on him.\u00a0 Behind him, Batman, <em>Bruce Wayne</em>, stood, a glowering shadow glaring at Tim.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No no no no no\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014it was a mistake,\u201d Tim babbled, backing away until his head hit something hard.\u00a0 He looked up and saw the glass wall of the cell.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014you\u2019re not Jason, of course you\u2019re not Jason, that would be stupid\u2014it\u2019s ridiculous, right, like Bruce Wayne would ever be Batman?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin and Batman were still silently staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m s\u2014sorry,\u201d Tim gasped, the tears flowing harder, making it difficult to see if they were advancing on him, or\u2014or what if they thought he was a bad guy?\u00a0 What if they thought he was working with Hood?\u00a0 What if they <em>took his memories away</em>?\u00a0 \u201cI did\u2014didn\u2019t mean it, <em>please</em>\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014I never told anyone, I <em>s\u2014swear</em>\u2014please don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2014<em>Robin</em> moved forward and Tim curled up into a ball, burying his face in his knees, knowing that all he was doing was delaying the inevitable.\u00a0 He was shaking, sobs echoing loudly, and he couldn\u2019t calm down, couldn\u2019t at least be brave in front of Batman and Robin.\u00a0 He was a stupid, <em>stupid</em> kid, and Hood had proved that, and <em>he</em> had proved that, and now the consequences were finally going to catch up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Robin said softly, hands catching his shoulders and pulling him up.\u00a0 Tim let himself be maneuvered, nearly limp, and kept his eyes squeezed shut.\u00a0 \u201cTim, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0 I <em>am</em> Jason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s eyes flew open, startled, and Jason was smiling at him, domino mask off.\u00a0 Behind him, Batman had removed his cowl, and was staring at Tim with an expression sterner than Tim had ever seen on Bruce Wayne\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tim,\u201d Jason repeated, and tugged Tim back into a hug, \u201cWe\u2019re not mad.\u201d\u00a0 Tim clutched at him and buried his face in the bulletproof weave of the brightly colored suit.\u00a0 \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m <em>sorry</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s not your fault.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wasn\u2019t sure he believed him, but at least he was being nice about it.\u00a0 He lifted his head and scrubbed at his face, the tears leaving him shaky and drained, especially on top of the exhaustion and terror.\u00a0 He wanted to go home.\u00a0 He wanted to <em>sleep</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if Jason could read his mind, the older boy smiled softly at him, \u201cHow about we get you home, okay?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think B has any more questions for you, right?\u201d\u00a0 Tim looked at Bruce along with Jason, and the man nodded after a long pause.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Jason chirped, gently tugging him up to his feet.\u00a0 Tim wavered, but Jason kept an arm around his shoulders, and Tim leaned into his warmth.\u00a0 If this was the last time he remembered who Robin was, he wanted to make the most of it.\u00a0 \u201cWhere do you live, Timmers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNext door,\u201d Tim whispered.\u00a0 Jason stared at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Drakes own the property next to ours,\u201d Bruce said mildly, and Jason blinked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting someone to kidnap the neighbor kid, but okay.\u00a0 What about your parents? \u00a0Did Hood hurt them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shook his head.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not at home,\u201d he rasped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2014do you want to call them?\u00a0 Can they come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shook his head again.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re on a trip,\u201d Tim said wearily, \u201cThey\u2014won\u2019t be home any time soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2014okay, um, who\u2019s staying with you?\u00a0 We can call them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo you even know where they are right now?\u00a0 Do you know when they\u2019re coming back?\u00a0 Do you realize that normal parents don\u2019t leave their kids unsupervised for months?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim burst into tears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2014hey, Tim, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d Jason said, panicked, \u201cI swear, you\u2019re not in trouble\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014<em>no one</em>,\u201d Tim forced out through gasping sobs, because no one was at home, no one was staying with him, no one would\u2019ve even <em>realized</em> he was missing until he didn\u2019t show up for school on Monday, and he\u2019d been <em>that</em> close to dying because no one would\u2019ve come looking for him.\u00a0 \u201cNo one\u2019s at home\u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014my parents\u2014they\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re in Peru\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFlight records show them landing in Guyana yesterday morning,\u201d Bruce said levelly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shuddered harder\u2014that meant they\u2019d changed their itinerary again, that meant they would be coming home <em>later</em>, and right now all he wanted was one of his mother\u2019s hugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Bruce said quietly, \u201cAre you telling me that there is no one in your house except you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nodded shakily, and something clouded over Bruce\u2019s face.\u00a0 Jason tightened his grip around Tim.\u00a0 \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t be alone right now, so how about a sleepover?\u201d the older boy chirped, grinning at Tim, \u201cAlfred makes the <em>best</em> hot chocolate, and we can watch Bruce\u2019s stupid old black-and-white movies and eat cookies!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce mouthed <em>\u2018stupid old\u2019</em> and looked mock affronted.\u00a0 Tim couldn\u2019t help the giggle, and Bruce\u2019s expression smoothened to something softer.\u00a0 Something like the look on his face whenever he watched Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim said quietly, and Jason beamed at him.\u00a0 He could stay with the Waynes for a night.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>In another dimension\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is that <em>any </em>better than what I did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe because I didn\u2019t leave him in some random alley in the East End!\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t let him think I was <em>dead</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kidnapped him!\u00a0 You actually did the whole gag-zipties-locked-in-a-cell!\u00a0 How is that not traumatizing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough time to explain things!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell perhaps if you hadn\u2019t wasted time dismembering the clown into a hundred pieces\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, if you thought I was going to let that shitstain <em>live</em>\u2014what the fuck are you doing, Replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHugging you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor being a good big brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Timmy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears Drake is suffering from an undiagnosed head injury.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is exactly the kind of sappy shit I was trying to <em>avoid</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian was on a mission.\u00a0 A very dangerous, classified mission.\u00a0 Not an assassination\u2014he was still too young for that, or so his mother had argued, but according to her, Damian was too young for <em>everything</em>.\u00a0 No, this mission wasn\u2019t to take someone\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was to save one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Damian murmured to the wriggling bundle in his hands, the bundle carefully wrapped to conceal the furry shape and mute those weak cries but not suffocate the little one tucked inside.\u00a0 The mouser in the practice yards had a litter three weeks ago, and it had become apparent that the littlest kitten in the batch was having difficulties.\u00a0 The last time this happened, Mother had told him that the mama cat wouldn\u2019t care for a struggling runt, but Damian had watched <em>carefully </em>this time, and the mama cat wasn\u2019t abandoning it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the League had no use for a kitten too weak to hunt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian couldn\u2019t let that happen, not to this small, little kitten, not when there was a <em>chance</em> he could get it hale and healthy.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here\u2014these halls were forbidden territory\u2014but his mother had shown him the secret paths just in case, and they were currently empty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShush,\u201d Damian admonished the little bundle at a particularly sharp cry, \u201cI am <em>helping</em> you.\u00a0 You must remain quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another bend in the dark hallway, and suddenly he was standing at the entrance to a large underground cavern, watching the green light play off the dark stone.\u00a0 The majority of the cavern was taken up by an irregular pool of glowing green water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian swallowed, and scanned the cavern to make sure that Grandfather wasn\u2019t here.\u00a0 Use of a Lazarus Pit was strictly regulated.\u00a0 But the place was empty and Damian\u2019s window of opportunity was closing fast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he could take a step closer, an awful screeching noise echoed in the cavern and dread clutched grasping fingers around his throat.\u00a0 <em>No</em>, Damian thought, horrified, Grandfather was here and he\u2019d take the kitten and snap its neck and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noise cut out and Damian dared to raise his head a fraction.\u00a0 There was a shadow struggling against the wall, but no one else in sight.\u00a0 Damian lifted his head further\u2014no Ubu, no guards, no Mother\u2026and the shadow was too short to be Grandfather.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They straightened and half-turned, enough to give Damian a glimpse of a red-and-black uniform that looked nothing like League robes.\u00a0 \u201cOh my god,\u201d the figure groaned in American English, \u201cYou have <em>got </em>to be kidding me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t a member of the League.\u00a0 This was an <em>intruder</em>.\u00a0 The proper thing would be to retreat and inform someone that they had a trespasser.\u00a0 But the kitten was still whimpering in Damian\u2019s hands and if he could just steal closer to the Pit without the intruder noticing\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kitten took that moment to make a high cheep, and the figure spun around. \u00a0Damian scrambled back, but the figure merely raised empty, gloved hands in a gesture of surrender.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian paused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d\u00a0 The figure had an odd, raccoon-eyed mask over his eyes, and part of his uniform included a cape.\u00a0 No large weapons, but several pockets on his belt.\u00a0 No indication of how he\u2019d managed to make his way into the guarded sanctuary at the very heart of Nanda Parbat.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not here to\u2014<em>Damian</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian jerked back a further step, almost forgetting not to squeeze down on the kitten in his hands.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d he demanded, and the figure\u2019s entire face spasmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe demon\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d he muttered mostly under his breath, before raising his voice, \u201cI know your father.\u00a0 He wants to meet you.\u00a0 Do you want to come with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Father?\u00a0 Damian had been trying for <em>years</em> to persuade Mother to let him visit, he\u2019d heard so many stories and he wanted to meet his father so very badly\u2014which would make this the perfect trap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Damian demanded instead, \u201cHow did you get in here?\u00a0 You\u2019re trespassing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story and I don\u2019t have enough time,\u201d the masked stranger\u2019s voice twisted oddly on that last word, \u201cBut you can call me Drake.\u00a0 I can take you to your father.\u201d\u00a0 He extended his hand, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian shuffled his grip on the kitten and drew his dagger with his free hand.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know if this was a test or a trap, but he wouldn\u2019t fall for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake dropped his hand and gave him a rueful smile, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry\u2014Dick would\u2019ve done this a better way, but I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\u00a0 Sorry for <em>what</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian tensed his guard as the masked stranger lunged, but he was <em>fast</em>, faster than any opponent Damian had faced before, and Damian\u2019s knife skidded away when the man snapped out a bo staff.\u00a0 Damian was being trained by the finest assassins in the League, but this man moved like <em>Mother</em>, and Damian wasn\u2019t fast enough to stop Drake as the man breached his guard and something sharp pricked his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Immediately, everything started to go dizzy.\u00a0 Strong hands curled around his shoulders instead of letting him fall, and the kitten began to wail as his grip slackened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making that squeaking noise?\u201d the intruder\u2019s voice faded out, along with the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian\u2019s return to consciousness was fuzzy, and he could only weakly curl his hands where he was slumped on top a wooden table.\u00a0 He was surprisingly not restrained\u2014a big mistake.\u00a0 Damian would play dumb, and then, when it was least expected, he would show Drake why no one underestimated the Heir to the Demon\u2019s Head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake was sitting in a chair, tapping away on a computer.\u00a0 The dim glow reflected eerily off his white lenses.\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d he said conversationally, as though he\u2019d sensed that Damian was awake, \u201cYou\u2019d think that a six-hundred-year-old megalomaniac with trust issues would have better security.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t changed his password in <em>years</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian struggled to lift his head, and the effort nearly sent him back to sleep.\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChecking some information, destroying Ra\u2019s\u2019 safeguards, setting up a self-destruct sequence that should, in theory, eliminate the Pit under this base.\u00a0 You know.\u00a0 The usual stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A dull kind of horror settled in Damian\u2019s gut.\u00a0 This\u2014this was Grandfather\u2019s office, that was <em>Grandfather\u2019s computer</em>, and this intruder was skipping through files like they were his own.\u00a0 Damian tried to sit up, and a weak, faint <em>meow</em> stopped him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian froze.\u00a0 The weight on his stomach wasn\u2019t a bruise as he\u2019d expected, but a tiny, warm, trembling ball.\u00a0 The kitten.\u00a0 The kitten was still alive.\u00a0 He curled an unsteady arm around it to keep it tucked against his side.\u00a0 Drake didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Damian croaked out, trying to deflect, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\u00a0 <em>What are you doing with me</em>, he didn\u2019t say, because Damian had been on guard for assassins his whole life.\u00a0 He was Heir to the Demon\u2019s Head, Heir to the Bat, and there\u2019d been a price on his head since before he could talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSending Ra\u2019s slithering back to his caves?\u201d Drake raised an eyebrow, not looking away from the screen.\u00a0 He appeared to be accessing reports about the One Who Is All.\u00a0 \u201cYour grandfather and I aren\u2019t on good terms, and this is the perfect opportunity for a little revenge.\u00a0 Plus, this should distract him from going after us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian\u2019s blood went cold.\u00a0 Not an assassination.\u00a0 A <em>kidnapping</em>.\u00a0 He pushed down <em>hard</em> on the table to lever himself up\u2014he needed to get away, needed to shout or scream or raise the alarm\u2014and the room tilted alarmingly around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His arm buckled, his hand slipped, and he let out a hoarse cry as he toppled off the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An arm caught his shoulder before Damian could fall, and gently pushed him back.\u00a0 \u201cCareful,\u201d Drake said, \u201cI know about your \u2018superior immunity to toxins\u2019 or whatever you call it, but you\u2019re still going to be woozy for a while.\u201d\u00a0 There was some indignant meowing and a soft weight was again transferred into his lap.\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s your kitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything <em>was</em> very dizzy, and by the time the world stopped spinning around him, Damian became aware that he was being carried.\u00a0 The kitten\u2019s weight was gone, he could no longer hear it cheeping, and he weakly struggled against his abductor\u2019s grasp, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Weak</em>, he heard his grandfather chastising him, <em>and you dare to call yourself my heir?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No\u2014no, Damian would be better, he would try <em>harder</em>, he swore, Grandfather <em>please</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian didn\u2019t realize they were outside until he was deposited on a hard seat and buckled in.\u00a0 Drake disappeared, slamming the door shut\u2014truck, they were in a truck, it was night outside and damp and chill and Damian tried to shout but nothing came out of his throat louder than a cracking rasp\u2014and reappeared on the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the man fumbled with his cloak, unclasped it, and used it to cover Damian before reaching into a pocket to\u2026withdraw a trembling ball of fluff.\u00a0 He placed the kitten in Damian\u2019s lap, under the cloak.\u00a0 \u201cTime to go off-roading.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s smile was slightly manic as he started the car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Behind them, something made a large, cracking sound, and the ground shuddered.\u00a0 Shouts of alarm sounded all around them.\u00a0 In the distance, a piercing wail started ringing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They drove straight through the gates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one stopped them.\u00a0 No one noticed, too focused on whatever was happening behind them to pay attention to the truck leaving the compound.\u00a0 No one even <em>looked</em> at Damian, trying to call for help while strapped in place, his limbs heavy and uncoordinated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With every attempt at a struggle, his energy drained further and faster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake turned off the mountain road when they hit a stone field.\u00a0 The drive turned jarring, but Drake didn\u2019t seem to care.\u00a0 His expression was all satisfaction as they bounced over broken rock with only the moon\u2019s light to illuminate their way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian managed to twist in his seat enough to stare back at the mountain, hoping, <em>willing</em> someone to come after them, to realize, to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mountain gave an almighty shudder, and Damian could see the dust kick up all the way down the road.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His heart sank.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kitten made a tiny, desolate chirp, and Damian curled up as much as he could with the warm ball in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d fallen asleep until he was jostled awake.\u00a0 He was upright for some reason\u2014usually when Damian fell asleep in the training halls, Mother carried him to bed, why was he\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shifted, and froze.\u00a0 He was <em>restrained</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamian?\u201d came a recognizably unfamiliar voice, \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian sat as still as he could, trying to think past his pounding heartbeat.\u00a0 There was no meowing warmth in his lap anymore, and judging from the slit view between his cracked eyelids, it had just passed daybreak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were still in the truck.\u00a0 The restraint was a seatbelt.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t have a weapon, but if he moved fast enough, and the belt cooperated\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake caught his hand before he could complete the maneuver, the seatbelt jammed, and Damian was woozy enough that a particular hard jerk of the truck nearly sent him slamming into the dashboard. \u00a0Only Drake\u2019s grip prevented him from getting a concussion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d removed the domino mask, and without it, he looked years younger.\u00a0 A <em>teenager</em>.\u00a0 A teenager that moved like a trained warrior.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Drake cautioned, \u201cThe sedative\u2019s probably worn off, but you\u2019re probably hungry and thirsty.\u00a0 There\u2019s some food in the back.\u201d\u00a0 He was driving one-handed without effort, and something starker than terror slipped down Damian\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were few in the League of Assassins that Damian genuinely considered a threat.\u00a0 Few who emulated the near-unconscious ease of Mother and Grandfather, the <em>casualness</em> of the threat, the way their danger was nothing more than an afterthought.\u00a0 And Drake, whoever he was, moved the same way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour kitten\u2019s in the back too,\u201d Drake said.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t let go of Damian\u2019s hand.\u00a0 One jerk, and he could snap it in two.\u00a0 \u201cI set her up in a little box to avoid any accidents.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have any cat food, but I fed her a little meat and mixed some powdered milk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian couldn\u2019t tell whether it was a threat or not.\u00a0 From Grandfather, it would\u2019ve been.\u00a0 A threat, or a <em>test</em>.\u00a0 Any weakness was to be purged.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A tiny <em>meow</em> echoed from the back, and Damian broke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d he demanded, and Drake unwrapped his fingers from Damian\u2019s wrist.\u00a0 Damian cast a glance at the passenger side door, but they were moving too fast\u2014Drake had found a dusty road, and the mountains were behind them.\u00a0 Instead, he scrambled into the back, where there was a box filled with blankets and a trembling kitten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Damian hushed the kitten.\u00a0 There was indeed food and water back here, and Damian refilled the kitten\u2019s bowl while he used a water bottle to get the sticky aftertaste out of his mouth. \u00a0He cast a glance at Drake, and switched to League Dialect.\u00a0 \u201c<em>It\u2019s okay</em>,\u201d he murmured to the kitten, \u201c<em>We will escape and find our way home.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kitten meowed.\u00a0 Damian carefully didn\u2019t think about her likely fate when he returned to Nanda Parbat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, reequipped with a full stomach, the last of the dizziness chased away\u2014the door discretely checked and found to be locked\u2014Damian strategically chose a seat that offered him the best shielding should Drake attack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Damian demanded again, \u201cWhy did you kidnap me?\u00a0 Where are you taking me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you who I am, and I\u2019m taking you to your father,\u201d Drake said calmly, \u201cHe wants to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian narrowed his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d he said flatly.\u00a0 Mother had said, over and over, that Father would only want Damian when he was trained.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to see Father until I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTalia fed you lies,\u201d Drake said, and there was something <em>angry</em> in his even tone.\u00a0 \u201cYour father had no idea you existed.\u00a0 She never told him about you.\u00a0 If she did, Damian, I <em>promise</em> you that he would\u2019ve been with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No.\u00a0 <em>No</em>.\u00a0 He was lying.\u00a0 This was\u2014this was a trick.\u00a0 <em>He was lying</em>.\u00a0 Father\u2014Father knew about him.\u00a0 Father <em>had</em> to know about him.\u00a0 <em>Mother wouldn\u2019t lie</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Damian accused.\u00a0 The kitten\u2019s warmth was burning hot against his fingertips.\u00a0 \u201cI will have your <em>tongue</em> once Grandfather finds us.\u00a0 You cannot trick me.\u201d\u00a0 Mother had killed every threat to Damian, some in front of him, and this time he would beg to be allowed the privilege.\u00a0 To spill blood in defense of his family\u2019s honor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Drake only laughed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you, Damian,\u201d Drake said, stretching out in the driver\u2019s seat, \u201cI\u2019m taking you to your father.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t try to further engage Damian in conversation, and there was no point in Damian asking questions of a liar.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t versed enough in interrogation to tease out the truth, and it would only confuse him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, Drake had left him unmonitored in the backseat.\u00a0 There were no knives here, no daggers, and Damian had been stripped of his own weapons.\u00a0 However, there were several scattered supplies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Anything can be a weapon, shahzada</em>, Mother had whispered as she showed him how to braid a garrote, <em>you are never defenseless</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian would return to Nanda Parbat victorious, and he would kill his kidnapper and restore his family\u2019s honor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And maybe then he would finally be worthy of meeting his father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Damian\u2019s surprise, they stopped in a town.\u00a0 Or rather, they stopped outside the town, in a little overhang that hid the truck, and made the rest of the way on foot.\u00a0 Drake gathered the useful supplies, and Damian hid his improvised garrote in the seam of his pants and grabbed the kitten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was his chance.\u00a0 Damian stayed tense and alert, scanning his surroundings for a path to escape.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t a town he recognized, but they\u2019d been driving for only around eight hours, so there should definitely be a way to contact the League from here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only problem was that Damian was keenly aware that he was without guards.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t just <em>proclaim</em> that he was Heir to the Demon\u2019s Head, or he might end kidnapped by someone else.\u00a0 Drake had admonished him to stick to the older boy\u2019s side as they entered the town in the bustle of early morning market, and Damian stayed a little out of arm\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian would kill Drake first.\u00a0 He had none of the supplies to keep the boy unconscious, as much as they needed information about how he infiltrated the League.\u00a0 Damian would wait until they were somewhere relatively secluded and Drake was distracted, before striking.\u00a0 After the older boy was dead, Damian could hunt through town for a League contact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep an eye out for any place that might have a computer,\u201d Drake murmured as they passed quietly through the market, \u201cSo we can send a message to Batman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian stumbled and nearly fell flat on his face.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re contacting Father?\u201d he asked, his voice embarrassingly high-pitched.\u00a0 Damian hadn\u2019t expected\u2014he didn\u2019t\u2014Mother had said\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Drake looked down at him, surprised, \u201cI can\u2019t get us all the way to Gotham by myself.\u201d\u00a0 He took a glance at a strange watch on his wrist, and something in his face tightened, \u201cI don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026What if Drake had <em>actually</em> been sent by Father?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, it was a trick, Mother would\u2019ve <em>told</em> him\u2014but Damian had never gotten a direct message from Father before, only the pictures and videos Mother had shown him.\u00a0 What if Drake was telling the truth?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No.\u00a0 This was a <em>trick</em>.\u00a0 He was just trying to confuse Damian.\u00a0 And it was <em>working</em>.\u00a0 Damian bundled the kitten closer to his chest and breathed out slowly.\u00a0 \u201c<em>When we get the opportunity, we will strike</em>,\u201d he promised the kitten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It cheeped at him, and he felt ridiculously reassured.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian had to ensure that the kitten was out of harm\u2019s way when he attacked.\u00a0 Perhaps if he mentioned a vital role for the kitten, Mother would let him keep it.\u00a0 He could train it to attack his enemies and keep watch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But first, Drake.\u00a0 They were reaching the end of the market, and Drake\u2019s footsteps shifted to purposeful.\u00a0 Damian felt a prickle down his spine, the sensation of eyes chasing him.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a transport office over there, that should have a computer.\u201d\u00a0 Damian followed Drake, and felt the stillness of an assassin\u2019s wait settle into his bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake entered through the back door\u2014the office was empty, and there <em>was</em> an old PC in the corner.\u00a0 The older boy gleefully took a seat and began tapping away, not noticing that Damian stayed a few steps behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He carefully placed the kitten on the desk.\u00a0 It meowed plaintively at the loss of warmth, and Damian stilled.\u00a0 <em>Quiet</em>, he tried to impart telepathically, and grabbed a cloth to curl around it and keep it occupied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kitten yawned, stretched, and slumped in place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian breathed in and out, slow and deep.\u00a0 He retrieved the makeshift garrote, and twisted his fingers in the wire to steady his grip.\u00a0 Over the head, snap taut around the neck, cross the ends, twist, and <em>pull</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A minute to choke him out.\u00a0 Check for pulse and breathing before letting go.\u00a0 Finish the kill.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian breathed in and out, silent and slow.\u00a0 Drake was focused on the computer.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t recognize what program he was running, but he appeared to have a chat window up.\u00a0 The message was clearly coded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>How many packages</em>, the question popped up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>One</em>, Drake replied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian lunged.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake had been sitting down, but the chair was still high enough that Damian had to lift his arms, and that proved to be his undoing.\u00a0 Drake moved, much faster than Damian expected, and before Damian could pull the garrote back, there were fingers wrapping around the wire, protecting Drake\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian cursed, and <em>pulled</em>, but Drake slipped down in the chair like he\u2019d suddenly gone boneless, and the braided wire hit nothing.\u00a0 Drake twisted as he popped back up, and Damian\u2019s fingers were caught in the wire now, yanked forward with Drake\u2019s pull, and before Damian could extract them, or kick Drake, or <em>anything</em>, the wire constricted tight around his wrists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake finished by tying the restraint to the arm of the chair and leaned back to study Damian with cool blue eyes.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even look winded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you waited this long.\u201d\u00a0 Drake sounded <em>amused</em>.\u00a0 \u201cCongrats on beating the demon brat\u2019s record.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian was\u2014his heart was beating.\u00a0 Very loudly.\u00a0 If he messed up in training, his teachers would only admonish him, but there had been one teacher who thought Damian needed to learn a lesson on what happened in the <em>real world</em> if he missed his target, and Mother had <em>eviscerated</em> the man when she found out what happened, but Damian never forgot, and here he was, in the real world, and he\u2019d missed his chance, and he was again bound in front of a superior opponent, alone, and this time Mother might not find him in time and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pressure around his wrists disappeared, and Damian nearly stumbled to his knees.\u00a0 In the second before he could yank back, something warm and vibrating was deposited in his hands, and Damian automatically grasped it tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Damian,\u201d the steady voice promised.\u00a0 Damian forced himself to look up, to keep his eyes on the greatest threat in the room.\u00a0 The kitten made a cross between a meow and a snarl as he nearly crushed it, but Drake\u2019s expression was level.\u00a0 \u201cI promise,\u201d the older boy said quietly, \u201cI am taking you to your father.\u00a0 You will be safe there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake was standing out of easy reach.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t make any move to come closer when Damian took a shaky step back.\u00a0 Or another, breathing unsteady and heart pounding wildly.\u00a0 The remnants of his garrote were on the floor, in too many pieces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian had no weapon.\u00a0 He\u2019d missed his opportunity.\u00a0 He <em>failed</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026But Drake wasn\u2019t attacking him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian couldn\u2019t read the expression on the older boy\u2019s face, but it felt\u2014it felt like he was being laid bare, like Damian had shown a vulnerability and Drake had <em>chosen not to strike</em>, except the weakness was already known and Damian was waiting for the attack.\u00a0 The attack would come.\u00a0 It always came.\u00a0 Weakness was to be exploited, and Drake was an idiot if he thought that Damian would believe his asinine claims of <em>safety</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Safety was what you made it, and Damian had failed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake took a step forward, mouth opening like he wanted to say something\u2014what, Damian didn\u2019t know, because there was a <em>whistle</em> and Drake ducked just in time to avoid the throwing knife scything through the air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a robe-clad figure climbing through the window.\u00a0 There was a commotion from the market as more figures pushed through the crowd, intent on the front door.\u00a0 \u201cOh, crap,\u201d Drake said from the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You have stolen the heir</em>,\u201d the assassin intoned in League Dialect, \u201c<em>Prepare to die</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot today, asshole,\u201d Drake leapt up with throwing stars of his own\u2014two made the assassin halt their advance, and one neatly buried itself in the PC, causing the screen to fritz out with static as the machine sparked and smoked.\u00a0 \u201cCome on!\u201d he shouted, grabbing Damian\u2019s hand and tugging him to the back door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian ripped his grip free and stumbled back just as the back door burst open.\u00a0 Drake didn\u2019t pause, didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t make a single motion of surprise, merely snapped out a bo staff in an elegant flick, and threw himself into the fray.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake was\u2026good.\u00a0 Drake was <em>more</em> than good, he was seamlessly taking out several of the best warriors in the League.\u00a0 But the League had them surrounded, and the tinkling of glass echoed as they dove in through other entrances.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Grab the boy</em>!\u201d someone shouted, and Drake spun, mid-strike, his gaze catching on Damian.\u00a0 Damian tightened his grip on the kitten, wanting to back away, there were too many people around him, there was a <em>frenzy</em> and Damian was unarmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake threw down a canister that swiftly exploded and blanketed the room in smoke.\u00a0 It was thick and acrid and burning and even through the layer of cloth Damian had hastily thrown up to cover his face, he was coughing.\u00a0 The kitten was trembling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A firm grip closed around his elbow.\u00a0 \u201cCome on,\u201d Drake hissed, and Damian was off-center enough to be unable to protest Drake tugging him in a direction he couldn\u2019t see.\u00a0 With all this smoke, it would be better to get out of the way, lest someone strike out blindly\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard a <em>snick</em>.\u00a0 A sword, slicing through smoke.\u00a0 It registered in Damian\u2019s mind a fraction of a second before he saw the blade scything through the thick fog.\u00a0 It registered in Damian\u2019s mind that the blade would\u2019ve taken his <em>head</em> a fraction of a second after he was impacted hard enough to hit the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lost his grip on his robe and the kitten.\u00a0 The kitten immediately started wailing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hard grip yanked him up again, and Damian could only crane his head to identify Drake\u2014face tight and focused\u2014before the older boy all-but-shoved him forward.\u00a0 \u201cWait,\u201d Damian\u2019s tongue unstuck, \u201cThe cat\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A none-too-pleased bundle of fur was deposited in his hands as Drake herded him towards the exit.\u00a0 There were no further assassins outside, and Drake quickly pulled him down a side street.\u00a0 Heading back out of the village, to where they left the truck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake was bleeding.\u00a0 His left sleeve was stained with red.\u00a0 His face was teary from the smoke.\u00a0 He was focused on scanning their surroundings and not on Damian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A perfect opening.\u00a0 A kick at the knee and a strike to the throat and Drake would be gasping in the dirt.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t need a weapon to finish it.\u00a0 To kill his kidnapper.\u00a0 To regain his honor and return home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That sword had been aimed for Damian\u2019s neck.\u00a0 He should be <em>dead</em>.\u00a0 If someone had not pushed him out of the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The stain was spreading.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course Drake wanted him alive.\u00a0 It would be difficult to ransom a corpse.\u00a0 There were a thousand different reasons as to why Drake had saved his life that had little to do with <em>safety</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then why did he rescue the kitten?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian curled tighter around his little bundle and kept pace with the older boy as he led them out of the village.\u00a0 Drake had his bleeding arm tucked close to his side, and Damian eyed the wound\u2014deep but not debilitating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d the words burst out without his permission.\u00a0 \u201cWhy did you save me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake startled, as if he hadn\u2019t noticed that Damian was right there.\u00a0 \u201cBecause you\u2019re my brother,\u201d Drake answered simply, and led them out of the village.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brother.\u00a0 Brother.\u00a0 <em>Brother</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mother had no other children.\u00a0 He was sure of it.\u00a0 And Damian could find nothing in Drake\u2019s features to hint at any familiarity with Mother or Grandfather.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which meant that Drake was lying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which meant that Father had other children, more children, <em>older</em> children.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which meant that Damian was not the Heir to the Bat.\u00a0 Had never been the Heir to the Bat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mother had <em>lied</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It meant that Damian had been futilely training in Nanda Parbat for years while other people consolidated power in his father\u2019s domain.\u00a0 It meant that everything he\u2019d been told was <em>useless</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d Damian asked.\u00a0 They were back in the truck, and heading along a road.\u00a0 There had been no further sign of the League.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d\u00a0 Drake had a knee up to brace the steering wheel, his injured arm tucked to his chest.\u00a0 He was driving one-handed and seemed unconcerned with presenting an open target.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you were my <em>brother</em>,\u201d Damian pushed all his disdain into his voice and allowed none of the lingering awe to remain.\u00a0 \u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to your father,\u201d Drake looked amused, \u201cThat should be enough proof.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how long will that take?\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on this road for <em>hours</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just need to get to the city.\u00a0 There\u2019s a safehouse there where we can sit tight.\u00a0 Bruce should get there soon.\u201d\u00a0 Drake checked the watch on his wrist and made a small frown.\u00a0 Damian could see the numbers blinking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soon.\u00a0 He was going to see his father <em>soon</em>.\u00a0 His stomach felt like a pit of eels and Damian suppressed the wriggling feeling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake rolled his eyes.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Impossible as always, little brother</em>,\u201d he murmured in\u2014in <em>League Dialect</em>, and Damian could feel something inside him freeze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake spoke with fluidity but the hint of an accent\u2014exposed enough to be fluent, but not enough to be natural.\u00a0 So Drake wasn\u2019t a part of the League, but fluent enough that he must have regular contact with someone who knew the language\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Father.\u00a0 He\u2014he had to be with Father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Drake took his hand off the wheel to wave a couple of his oddly shaped throwing stars and Damian snatched them.\u00a0 A <em>weapon</em>.\u00a0 Finally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tilted the unusually shaped blade and\u2014a bat.\u00a0 The blade was shaped like a <em>bat</em>.\u00a0 Not handmade, those edges were machine precise.\u00a0 Mother had a collection of Father\u2019s stuff that she occasionally let Damian see, and he knew these throwing stars were part of the collection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t prove anything,\u201d Damian said, unable to fully hide the waver in his tone.\u00a0 Drake merely chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blades were sharp, but felt\u2026unwieldy.\u00a0 Their center of gravity was off, weighted unfamiliarly, and his few testing throws at the dashboard ended in the blades clattering harmlessly off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Drake cautioned, \u201cThose things can shatter glass if you put some force into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTt,\u201d Damian huffed.\u00a0 He was not an <em>imbecile</em>.\u00a0 He could be careful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kept flicking the bat blades at the dashboard as Drake drove, the truck rumbling beneath them.\u00a0 The kitten was curled up peacefully in his lap, having already been fed and cleaned, and Drake hadn\u2019t stopped Damian or rationed their supplies.\u00a0 If not for the fact that Drake had drugged him and wasn\u2019t letting him escape, this wouldn\u2019t be a kidnapping at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m taking you to your father</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe\u2026maybe it wasn\u2019t a kidnapping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me about Father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake jerked his head up, startled, and hissed as he jostled his injury.\u00a0 The cut had been bound, and it was far too early for infection to set in, but Drake was looking oddly gaunt.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d he asked with a slight rasp, flicking those calculating blue eyes at Damian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What did he want to know?\u00a0 <em>Everything</em>.\u00a0 Mother had given him <em>crumbs</em> and Damian was slowly realizing just how much she\u2019d hidden from him.\u00a0 He wanted more information.\u00a0 He wanted <em>all</em> the information.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes Father have\u2026other children?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake made a bark of amusement.\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, and the pit in Damian\u2019s stomach sank deeper.\u00a0 \u201cI think we\u2019ve all lost count at this point\u2014some of them are legal guardianships, some are informal, but the Bat team has quite a few people on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Team</em>?\u201d Damian couldn\u2019t help but repeat, \u201cYou\u2014Father is Batman!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Drake darted a quick smile at him, \u201cBut he isn\u2019t the only vigilante in Gotham.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mother had told him that, but Damian had assumed that his Father had a splinter cell of assassins.\u00a0 Not\u2014Grandfather would never call the League his <em>team</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Damian asked quietly.\u00a0 How thoroughly had he miscalculated?\u00a0 How many more heirs did Father have, how many people would he have to fight to get what Mother had always told him was rightfully his?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt this point in time?\u00a0 I have no clue,\u201d Drake\u2019s expression was wry, \u201cBut let\u2019s see\u2014your oldest brother would be Dick, he\u2019s in his twenties.\u201d\u00a0 Father had <em>adult heirs</em>.\u00a0 \u201cThen comes Jason.\u00a0 Or Cass\u2014or well, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Drake darted a look at the papers he\u2019d stolen from Grandfather.\u00a0 \u201cSteph, maybe?\u00a0 Oh, I forgot Babs, she\u2019s technically the oldest but Bruce hasn\u2019t adopted her.\u00a0 And then\u2014Tim.\u201d\u00a0 Drake\u2019s tone went curiously flat.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s probably the closest to you in age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seven.\u00a0 Father had <em>seven children</em> already, <em>seven heirs</em> while Damian had been wasting his time in Nanda Parbat, and Mother had never <em>told him</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce will be delighted to see you,\u201d Drake smiled at him, \u201cHe loves getting new children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Damian had to be worthy.\u00a0 If his Father <em>chose</em> his followers, then Damian would need to\u2014to prove himself, and he had never thought he had to <em>demonstrate</em> why he deserved to be the heir.\u00a0 He thought it was his birthright.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian took a moment to mourn the future that Mother had weaved for him, before straightening in his seat.\u00a0 He was still Son of the Bat.\u00a0 Damian would <em>win</em> his position.\u00a0 He was trained.\u00a0 He was clever.\u00a0 He could prove his usefulness to Father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me about them,\u201d Damian demanded.\u00a0 He would learn as much about Father as he could before they met.</p>\n<p><br>\nDrake obliged.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The stories of Father and his other children lasted them all the way to the city, though Drake broke off when they left the truck to enter on foot.\u00a0 The stories were all strangely disjoint, like Drake was leaving out pieces of them, and every so often he winced and redirected the topic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, he was wincing for another reason as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look terrible,\u201d Damian said critically, as they paused at the mouth of yet another alleyway so Drake could lean against the wall and catch his breath.\u00a0 The older boy was pale and sweaty and his breathing had grown harsher.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Drake gave him a weak smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No.\u00a0 No, he was not.\u00a0 \u201cLeague blades are frequently poisoned,\u201d Damian said flatly.\u00a0 Drake\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even twitch\u2014he already knew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Drake said, and pushed upright to lead Damian deeper into the city, \u201cBruce will be here soon.\u201d\u00a0 He paired it with the absent glance at his wristwatch, a habit or a nervous tic that was getting increasingly more common over the past hour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes little difference if the League finds us first,\u201d Damian pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re heading to a safehouse,\u201d Drake said, and continued their path through the alleyways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, the League found them first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There</em>,\u201d came the harsh call, and both Damian and Drake spun to see a figure in dark robes blocking the road.\u00a0 \u201c<em>They\u2019re here</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake cursed, low and vicious, and made no attempt to stand and fight.\u00a0 \u201cCome on,\u201d he yanked at Damian\u2019s arm to drag him into a run.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you they would find us!\u201d Damian huffed, but he kept pace with Drake.\u00a0 He wanted to meet Father.\u00a0 He wanted to find out the <em>truth</em>.\u00a0 He wanted the life Drake had spoken of, a father both warm and strict, older siblings that were keen teachers, a family that <em>protected</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Protection is for the weak</em>, Grandfather\u2019s voice echoed in his head.\u00a0 But\u2026but if they didn\u2019t protect the weak, how would they ever get strong?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kitten in his pocket meowed like it could hear his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t outrun them,\u201d Damian hissed, keeping pace easily with the older boy.\u00a0 Drake was faltering, and <em>fast</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to outrun them,\u201d Drake gasped, tugging Damian along in a dizzying set of turns through narrow alleyways.\u00a0 There were no League members in sight, but Damian knew they were being chased.\u00a0 \u201cWe just need to get to the safehouse.\u00a0 We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>True to his word, they came to a jagged halt outside a door set into the plain alleyway.\u00a0 The only indication that it wasn\u2019t another shop or house was the concealed keypad and three layers of security Drake had to bypass before he yanked open the door and shoved Damian inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inside was\u2026sparse.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a safehouse?\u201d Damian asked, eyeing the plain wooden furniture in the cramped room.\u00a0 Father was supposed to be <em>rich</em>.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a <em>shoebox</em>.\u201d\u00a0 Damian peered into the closest drawer to see if he could find a secret compartment, and had nearly finished exploring the entire cabinet before he realized that Drake had never answered him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrake?\u201d Damian turned, and froze when he saw the older boy leaning against the closed door, silently gasping, fingers curled tight on his arm right below his injury.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Damian said softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake sucked in a large breath and met Damian\u2019s gaze.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he wheezed, \u201cBruce will be here soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian didn\u2019t point out that Drake was putting a lot of faith in the man that had never once visited Damian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d Damian asked sharply, \u201cThe League will find us within the hour, and I doubt this place has the defenses to hold them off.\u201d\u00a0 And Drake looked like a strong wind would take him out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That jolted Drake into motion, he pushed off the door and headed for the back wall of the small room.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a panic room, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s secure,\u201d Drake explained, and revealed another concealed keypad.\u00a0 The door slid away from the wall and\u2014that explained why the room was so cramped.\u00a0 It was a tiny little bunker, bathroom and computer setup and a weapons cabinet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake deposited the files he\u2019d collected on the table and began typing on the computer.\u00a0 In a moment, a tracking map unfolded on the screen, with a blinking dot somewhere in the Caucasus.\u00a0 Drake let out a slow exhale and straightened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost here,\u201d Drake smiled.\u00a0 He looked nearly translucent in the harsh light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit down before you crack your head open,\u201d Damian snapped, setting the kitten on the table, \u201cAnd there is little purpose to a safe room if you <em>leave the door open</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake\u2019s gaze swung to the open wall, and his smile shaded to something more\u2026lost.\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d he said, and it didn\u2019t sound like agreement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another glance to his watch, and Damian spotted what looked like a timer counting down.\u00a0 It had minutes left, but according to the tracking map, Father looked to be still an hour out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamian,\u201d Drake said, and something cold slipped down Damian\u2019s spine.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026haven\u2019t told you everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>No</em>.\u00a0 \u201cYour concern should be treating that poisoned wound lest you expire before Father gets here,\u201d Damian said sharply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake slowly bent into a crouch, until he was on his knees to look Damian in the face.\u00a0 \u201cBruce isn\u2019t coming here for me,\u201d Drake said gently, \u201cHe\u2019s coming for <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>One package</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said Father sent you,\u201d Damian accused sharply, \u201cYou said\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Drake rebutted calmly, \u201cI said I would take you to him, and I have, as far as I can manage it.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour job isn\u2019t <em>complete</em>,\u201d Damian said stridently, heart beating too fast, \u201cYou make a poor escort if you don\u2019t finish\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamian,\u201d Drake said levelly, \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>What</em>?\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d Damian said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not from this time,\u201d Drake clarified, \u201cAnd I have to go home.\u201d\u00a0 He glanced again at the watch.\u00a0 Less than ten minutes left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2026made no sense.\u00a0 What did he mean, <em>not from this time</em>?\u00a0 Where was he from?\u00a0 Why had he <em>lied</em>?\u00a0 What\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re right.\u00a0 The League will find this room soon.\u00a0 They\u2019ll break in.\u00a0 I can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Drake said softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian felt the chill but he didn\u2019t know what it <em>meant</em>, too many competing thoughts were jostling for attention and he had gone strangely numb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour family is waiting for you,\u201d Drake promised, \u201cAll your brothers and sisters.\u00a0 And your father.\u00a0 They will be very happy to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian managed to claw some words through the numbness.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Drake said, and he truly looked sorry, \u201cI wish I could stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room was getting oddly blurry.\u00a0 Damian hadn\u2019t\u2014it was the heights of foolishness to trust a captor, but Drake had\u2014he said they were <em>brothers</em>, he\u2019d <em>saved</em> Damian, and the kitten, and he\u2014he\u2014he\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s a long story and I don\u2019t have enough <u>time</u>.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He hasn\u2019t changed his password in <u>years</u>.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Impossible as <u>always</u>, little brother.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a brief impression of warmth on his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The world is yours, little brother</em>,\u201d Drake murmured in the lilting tones of the language Damian had grown up with, \u201c<em>Protect it well</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The presence disappeared and Drake slipped away before Damian could grab him, stepping out of the bunker and watching him as the wall slid back.\u00a0 Damian saw his brother quirk his lips in a faint smile before the door sealed shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Damian finally managed to croak out, pressing his hands to the wall.\u00a0 His face was prickling.\u00a0 \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dot had been stationed right on top of the city for the past ten minutes.\u00a0 Damian was curled up in the chair, kitten carefully concealed in one of the drawers.\u00a0 Drake had protected it but\u2014but he hadn\u2019t stayed.\u00a0 And Father had been taught by Grandfather.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The computer <em>ding</em>ed.\u00a0 The outer security had been unlocked.\u00a0 Damian swallowed, and tightened his grip on the staff he found in the weapons cabinet.\u00a0 The batarangs were tucked in his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The computer beeped again, a second before the wall slid open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman.\u00a0 He was larger than Damian imagined, and both more real and more terrifying than the shadowed figure he\u2019d always seen in his mind.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t a creature of darkness.\u00a0 This was a <em>person</em>, a trained and dangerous warrior.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was Damian\u2019s father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamian?\u201d a gravelly voice asked and Damian swallowed, clearing his throat to reply\u2014before getting distracted by the brightly colored figure that appeared at Batman\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrake?\u201d Damian let out a shocked breath, but even as he said it he knew it was wrong.\u00a0 This person was shorter, younger, not as fluid, and there were barely perceptible differences in the roundness of his cheeks underneath the domino mask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d\u00a0 It was Drake\u2019s voice, albeit younger.\u00a0 \u201cHi?\u00a0 I\u2019m Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m not from this time.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh.\u00a0 <em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Drake?\u201d Batman asked, his voice less gravelly and much softer.\u00a0 He was no longer looming in the doorway and the pressure squeezing Damian\u2019s lungs loosened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Damian couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from Robin, \u201cMy\u2014guide.\u201d\u00a0 Kidnapper.\u00a0 Older brother.\u00a0 \u201cHe was\u2014\u201d <em>he looks like you.</em>\u00a0 \u201cHe went into the city.\u00a0 To draw the League assassins away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0 Batman and Robin exchanged a glance, and Damian could see a wealth of unspoken information in that gaze.\u00a0 Drake had been right.\u00a0 It was\u2014it was <em>superior</em> teamwork.\u00a0 It would never be possible in the League.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll find this\u2026Drake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian shook his head.\u00a0 \u201cHe said he\u2019s leaving,\u201d he forced out.\u00a0 <em>He\u2019s not coming back</em>, he didn\u2019t add.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another look.\u00a0 \u201cWing, Blue,\u201d Robin spoke into a communicator, \u201cBe on the lookout for temporal anomalies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ha</em>,\u201d a tinny voice echoed from the device.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shut up, Dickhead, you don\u2019t win the bet until we find it</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re just a sore loser, Bluebird.\u00a0 Who was it this time, Robin?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrake,\u201d Robin almost whispered into the device, darting a look at Damian and smiling hesitantly.\u00a0 There was a beat of silence, and then a crackling noise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What, we just skipped my turn?</em>\u201d the second voice said, clearly aggrieved, and there was an explosion of chatter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Batman growled, and Damian flinched back automatically.\u00a0 \u201cSearch the city and report back <em>quickly</em>.\u00a0 We\u2019re not staying here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was displeased, Father was angry, he was\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sir, yes sir</em>,\u201d came a clearly sarcastic response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t worry, B, we\u2019ll find the anomaly!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman sighed, and the sound was more resigned than Damian expected.\u00a0 When he turned back to Damian, he pulled the cowl up, and Damian looked up at his father\u2019s face for the very first time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes were warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Damian,\u201d Father smiled and held out a hand, \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>In another dimension\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou moronic <em>imbecile</em>, you call that a <em>plan</em>, you nearly destroyed everything with your half-baked fumbling\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow.\u00a0 He locked the kid in a cell <em>and</em> made him think he was dead.\u00a0 What an overachiever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a <em>cell</em>, Jason\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really think so highly of your overinflated abilities as to take on the <em>League of Assassins</em> in a weekend?\u00a0 Could your simple, feeble mind not understand the concept of <em>sending a message</em>, or was your ego too high to let more qualified others handle the situation\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnicalities.\u00a0 Hey, does that mean he\u2019s the worst one out of the three of us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t needlessly traumatize a child, so probably not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so kidnapping\u2019s fine when <em>he</em> does it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a rescue <em>and</em> he told the baby bat the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd of course you were too weak and slow to dodge a clearly poisoned blade, I don\u2019t know why we even bother to keep you on the team, you are nothing more than <em>dead weight</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDami. \u00a0Dames.\u00a0 Little D.\u00a0 You know Tim\u2019s unconscious, right?\u00a0 He can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I don\u2019t care</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a cold night in Gotham.\u00a0 As was custom when Father was away, the remaining Bats divided the territory among them and spread out in a carefully coordinated patrol.\u00a0 In this particular instance, Batgirl, Black Bat, and Spoiler were also out of town, down south on the trail of a gang, so it was only the Birds that were left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin, check in,\u201d Nightwing\u2019s voice sounded over the comms, and Damian rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he replied concisely, \u201cNo signs of disturbance, which should be obvious, since I\u2019m patrolling <em>Burnley</em>.\u201d\u00a0 His radius had been restricted to five miles around the Wayne penthouse because all his brothers were worrywarts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been out as Robin for a full six months now, and he could take care of himself.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t need to <em>hover</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>This is Crow, Tricorner is quiet aside from some muggings</em>,\u201d Crow thankfully rescued him before Nightwing could respond.\u00a0 Pushy older brothers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bluebird here</em>,\u201d the next eldest\u2019s voice echoed with the background of grunts, \u201c<em>Somerset\u2019s as quiet as it can be</em>.\u201d\u00a0 There was the distinctive sound of a gun firing and Bluebird\u2019s hastily bitten-off curse.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Oh, asshole, do you really want to know how I feel about guns</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Okay, birdies</em>,\u201d Nightwing hummed, \u201c<em>Remember to call for backup if you need it and</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yeah, yeah</em>,\u201d Blue muttered, accompanied by a loud shriek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We <u>know</u>, Wing</em>,\u201d Crow said in exasperation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTt,\u201d Damian contributed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing sighed, loud and put-upon.\u00a0 \u201c<em>I get no respect</em>,\u201d he muttered sulkily, \u201c<em>After all I\u2019ve done for you all</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Kinda hard to respect a guy that nearly drowned in his own bowl of cereal</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I was running on sixty hours of no sleep</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ve stayed awake for longer, Wing, that\u2019s not really an excuse</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Excuse me, Crow, is there something you want to tell us</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian exhaled through his nose and tapped the comm to private line only.\u00a0 Utter idiots.\u00a0 Grandfather would\u2019ve had them all whipped for insubordination.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Grandfather was far away, and they weren\u2019t in the League, and the worst punishment Damian had gotten was the month-long restriction where he wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere without supervision because of that plan to rescue Father.\u00a0 Richard had been <em>furious</em> and Damian had hid behind Timothy in cowardice, but neither of them had gotten a beating.\u00a0 Richard had yelled very loudly, but he apologized the next day, and Damian had still gotten to spend time with the family, still trained, was still allowed to go to school and visit Selina and the shelter and all the things he normally did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt\u2026safe here.\u00a0 Just like Drake had promised, all those years ago.\u00a0 Damian had gotten the whole story, Nightwing and Jason, and Hood and Timothy, and they had put together enough pieces to suggest involuntary dimension travel, but they had more questions than facts when it came to the Bats of the other dimension.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who were they?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What did they want?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How were they accessing this dimension?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They had no way of traveling between dimensions, so the questions were forced to remain.\u00a0 Damian wondered if someday, the alternate version of <em>him</em> would show up and lead them to a new sibling.\u00a0 He was tired of being the youngest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He readied the grapple for the long swing across West Park Street, but was halted by a faint, imperceptible sound.\u00a0 He paused on the ledge, eyes narrowed and ears straining, watching for movement\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A loud, discordant sound screeched through the air, like fingernails dragging down chalkboard, or a particularly high-pitched scream, or the awful rent of a <em>dimension being torn open</em>.\u00a0 Damian was whirling around before he made the conscious decision to, heart stuck in his throat, lightening with hope and trepidation, searching for the outline of a figure in red and black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The figure that tumbled out on the rooftop, tucked neatly into a roll and straightening up, was wearing red and black.\u00a0 But the red was highlighted by green, the black with yellow, and they had a <em>sword</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A sword that looked very familiar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The figure\u2014they were short, shorter than him by an inch or two\u2014spun around in the direction he\u2019d come from, and snarled at empty air.\u00a0 Damian shifted on his perch, fingers tightening on the hilt of his own sword, and watched them curse at the night before the figure turned towards him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sword out and levelled at his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI presume this is the same dimension that my idiot predecessors have visited,\u201d the alternate version of himself intoned.\u00a0 More than the sword pointed at him, Damian was concerned if <em>he</em> sounded as supercilious as the double.\u00a0 \u201cYou will take me to your facilities to restock my supplies in anticipation of my departure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian was stuck somewhere halfway between horror and curiosity, and hovered over the comm button.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t need to call the others.\u00a0 This was <em>himself</em>, and a stuck-up version at that.\u00a0 He could handle it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou presume much,\u201d Damian retorted.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t draw his sword, not yet.\u00a0 The other-Robin\u2019s sword was an emphasis, not a real threat.\u00a0 \u201cI have no idea who you are and I don\u2019t take orders from Christmas ornaments.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Robin outfit hadn\u2019t had <em>that</em> much red and green since Jason\u2019s earliest costumes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other-Robin bristled instantly, \u201cYou insolent <em>whelp</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian\u2019s comm crackled to life with Crow\u2019s tense voice, \u201c<em>All points.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got visitors.\u00a0 Status undetermined.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something chilled inside Damian, and <em>now</em> he drew his sword.\u00a0 \u201cYou didn\u2019t come here alone,\u201d Damian accused, shifting to a ready stance, \u201cHow many?\u00a0 And to what purpose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other-him merely looked confused.\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2014\u201d he started, before cutting off and slightly tilting his head, like he was listening to a conversation Damian couldn\u2019t hear.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Morons</em>,\u201d he ended on a hiss, before turning his stare back to Damian, \u201cVery well.\u00a0 It appears that none of my predecessors has enough <em>common sense</em> to <em>dodge</em>.\u00a0 We might as well track down the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe others?\u201d Damian asked warily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing, Hood, Red Robin,\u201d the other-Robin recited tersely, \u201cThe ones that meddled in this infernal dimension by kidnapping children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim heard Robin\u2019s comm <em>click</em> as he exited the main line and followed suit before either of his big brothers could question his sleeping habits again.\u00a0 He was maintaining a much better schedule now than he had in those awful few weeks when everyone thought that Bruce was dead, but occasionally he got sucked into a spiral and didn\u2019t emerge for a couple of days, and he didn\u2019t need an assigned babysitter <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, when Bluebird and Nightwing started sniping at each other, they would never stop.\u00a0 He still remembered how terrifying Dick\u2019s first visit after Tim\u2019s adoption had been, before he realized that all their teasing and taunting was friendly and Jason wasn\u2019t actually going to murder Dick and bury him out back.\u00a0 And everyone and their mother knew what Dick had done to that creep who\u2019d gotten a little too familiar with Jason at a gala.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim had only really, fully understood their protectiveness after they\u2019d found Damian.\u00a0 Seeing the kid trailing behind Tim, words sharp but actions hesitant\u2014well, was it any wonder that Tim had taken wholeheartedly to being a big brother?\u00a0 Steamrolling Bruce\u2019s objections every time Damian wanted to add to his menagerie was the least he could do for his little brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim finished his route in Tricorner and headed across the bridge and into Old Gotham.\u00a0 His fingers were itching at leaving Robin clear on the other side of Gotham, all by himself\u2014he knew that Nightwing was patrolling Burnley as well, keeping just enough distance so that Robin\u2019s feathers didn\u2019t get ruffled, but Tim was in charge of Robin\u2019s training and Robin was <em>his</em> responsibility.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the Financial District,\u201d Tim tapped the comm to relay the message, breaking off the bickering.\u00a0 He could still hear fighting from Bluebird\u2019s end. \u00a0\u201cBlue, do you want an assist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m good, baby bird</em>,\u201d Blue\u2019s drawl was accompanied by the sound of something <em>crack</em>ing, \u201c<em>Just some idiots that forgot who this territory belongs to</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somerset was Jason\u2019s, the whole island, whether as Bluebird\u2019s stomping grounds or Jason Wayne\u2019s work at the Wayne Foundation, and Tim knew he got prickly at any perceived interference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u00a0 Quiet over here.\u201d\u00a0 Tim set his grapple and watched the hook soar above the streets of Gotham, climbing up to take to the skyscrapers.\u00a0 Normally, this was one of the more enjoyable runs, flying through the sky with his cape flaring out behind him, as dark as night.\u00a0 This time however, a prickling sensation was coiling at the top of his spine, and he shivered under the regard of an unseen stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Below\u2014no one was looking up.\u00a0 Side to side\u2014no sign of any shadowy figures, or the assassins Ra\u2019s liked to waste from time to time.\u00a0 Front\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s heart caught in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He snapped his bo staff out one-handed, armed and ready as he skidded to a stop on the helipad on top of Wayne Tower.\u00a0 Grapple unhooked and stowed, he tapped the comm to broadcast to all lines as the red-and-black figure detached smoothly from the shadows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The staff matched his own.\u00a0 The uniform matched the pictures.\u00a0 \u201cAll points,\u201d Tim whispered to the comm, \u201cWe have visitors.\u201d\u00a0 The figure tilted their head to one side, silent.\u00a0 \u201cStatus undetermined.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Immediate voices rose on the other end of the line but Tim ignored it, focusing on his opponent.\u00a0 He stepped forward, the figure stepped to the side.\u00a0 A testing feint, and no response.\u00a0 Tim twirling his staff, and they did as well.\u00a0 The moves were familiar\u2014only two other people on this planet had the same fighting style, and this was not Lady Shiva or Black Bat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll save you the energy,\u201d the figure spoke, and that was Tim\u2019s boardroom voice, sharp and calculating, \u201cYou know who I am.\u00a0 You know where I\u2019m from.\u00a0 I just want to find my brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou understand that I have questions,\u201d Tim pressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2026<em>is</em> this whole thing?\u201d Tim asked, which wasn\u2019t terribly eloquent, but he had faith that other-him could puzzle it out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome idiot got his hands on a portal gun and promptly lost the instruction booklet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been trying to find him for a fortnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the crossing over\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he fires the gun, it creates a portal that sucks in everything close to it.\u00a0 So far, the portals have all been aimed at this particular dimension.\u00a0 The fool doesn\u2019t even know how to change the settings.\u201d\u00a0 The figure\u2014Drake, Damian had called him\u2014made a sigh that Tim recognized.\u00a0 The <em>if-I-was-a-supervillain-I-could-do-this-ten-times-better</em> sigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It reassured him.\u00a0 Slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so far, you, Hood, and Nightwing have crossed over?\u201d Tim asked.\u00a0 He still had nightmares of that red helmet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as we know.\u00a0 Luckily, the gun has a reverse feature, and if you press that, everything that originally went through gets sucked back.\u00a0 Due to time distortions however, what passes for a few minutes in our time ends up as days in yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d\u00a0 All things that made sense, especially given that other-him didn\u2019t look older than their security camera footage even though it had been years.\u00a0 \u201cThe kidnapping?\u00a0 Ra\u2019s al Ghul?\u00a0 What was that all about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my world, the kid didn\u2019t arrive in Gotham for another two years.\u00a0 And it was\u2026messy,\u201d Drake shrugged, \u201cRa\u2019s was a problem.\u00a0 I took care of him in my world, I thought I\u2019d do you guys a favor and take care of him here too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake didn\u2019t just <em>take care of him</em>, he\u2019d blown up the man\u2019s base and handed them enough information to destroy everything Ra\u2019s took <em>six hundred years</em> to build.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t something you did on a whim.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t something <em>Tim</em> would do on a whim.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was something sharper about Drake, jagged lines where Tim didn\u2019t have any.\u00a0 It made him itch.\u00a0 Tim knew how easily his morals could slide, and Drake looked like he\u2019d spiraled a long way down before something dragged him back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim updated his mental files on Ra\u2019s al Ghul to make sure the man got nowhere near his family ever again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother question,\u201d Tim said, redirecting easily, \u201cWhat\u2019s the outfit called?\u201d\u00a0 He waved a hand to encapsulate all the red and black.\u00a0 When he created Crow, he\u2019d designed the suit for maximum stealth.\u00a0 And to make it even more difficult to differentiate between Cass and him, because it was too hilarious to pass up the chance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was about to ask the same,\u201d Drake smiled lightly, \u201cMine\u2019s Red Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stared blankly.\u00a0 Drake\u2019s expression looked less like a smile and more like a grimace the longer the silence stretched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Like the restaurant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is not a single joke you can make that I have not already heard,\u201d Drake said, painful smile fixed in place, \u201cMost of them from Jason, like it wasn\u2019t <em>his goddamn suit</em> in the first place\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jason</em> chose Red Robin?\u201d Tim was losing the battle to his giggles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Drake waved off, and Tim caught sight of the strange watch on his wrist, the one that had a timer counting down.\u00a0 It blinked in minutes.\u00a0 \u201cYours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCrow,\u201d Tim answered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake\u2019s face scrunched up, \u201c<em>Crow</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than a restaurant,\u201d Tim pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why Crow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put <em>that</em> much thought into it,\u201d Tim said, a little needled\u2014his plan to go to Paris had been very spur-of-the-moment. \u00a0\u201cBesides, it fit the bird theme.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBird theme?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Robin, Nightwing, Bluebird,\u201d Tim ticked off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bluebird</em>?\u201d Drake repeated, clearly confused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d Tim clarified, \u201cOr\u2014you said he was Red Robin\u2014\u201d and he was definitely going to make fun of Jay for that\u2014\u201cDid he choose something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembered the old, unsustained theory he had when Bruce and Jason explained the whole dimension travel story.\u00a0 He\u2019d forgotten about it over the years, especially when Jason ended up looking nothing like Hood and chose a completely different name, but a part of him had always wondered\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake\u2019s lips quirked into a faint smile.\u00a0 \u201cHe <em>is</em> sorry about the kidnapping,\u201d Drake said softly, \u201cHe hadn\u2019t intended it to be so\u2026traumatizing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe slaughtered his way through Gotham,\u201d Tim pointed out, heart pounding.\u00a0 Drake shrugged a shoulder, as if to say <em>so what?</em>\u00a0 \u201cHe left the Joker in <em>pieces</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen what he did to the one in our world,\u201d Drake said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty.\u00a0 Or quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d it couldn\u2019t be Jason, Jason had never, Jason <em>would</em> never, Jason was too passionate to be a coldblooded killer, too comforting to <em>lock children in cells</em>\u2014\u201cHe kidnapped me and <em>left me in a cage</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake shrugged again, utterly unconcerned, \u201cAt least he didn\u2019t slit your throat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gaped at him.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t\u2014he hadn\u2019t just heard\u2014he couldn\u2019t process that right now.\u00a0 Deep breath, shove that piece of information way, way down until they could debrief.\u00a0 Hood wasn\u2019t <em>his</em> Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you still trust him on your team?\u201d Tim asked, all judgement.\u00a0 If his brother had tried to <em>murder</em> him\u2026god, what kind of fucked-up world did they come from?\u00a0 Tim had to mentally revise all his assumptions and recalibrate the context for their actions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Drake chirped, \u201c\u2026But we should probably find him before he blows something up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His comm clicked to life, and he realized it had been strangely silent this whole time.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Hello, birdies</em>,\u201d came a mechanized drawl he was intimately familiar with, \u201c<em>It looks like I caught a bluebird.\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you all come out and say hi?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason breathed slowly, in and out, trying to control the rage searing through him and curling to impotent ash because he was trussed up in so many knots that even <em>Batman</em> would have difficulty getting free.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>fuck</em> is your problem?\u201d Jason hissed at the red helmeted figure loitering a few steps away, spinning Jason\u2019s comm in his gloved fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy problem?\u201d Hood wasn\u2019t even looking at him, thoroughly dismissing him as a threat.\u00a0 It would\u2019ve been helpful if Jason had a single <em>inch</em> to maneuver free.\u00a0 As it was, it was just infuriating.\u00a0 \u201cIf I remember correctly, <em>you</em> were the one that attacked <em>me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason set his expression into a snarl.\u00a0 Of fucking course he\u2019d attacked, he\u2019d heard that godawful screech, thought it was someone yanking on a dumpster or something, and when he saw that gleaming red helmet, a distant memory clicked into place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bodies.\u00a0 Tim locked in a cell, crying and panicking and terrified.\u00a0 The clown, dismembered into a pile of bloody pieces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood, the traveler from another dimension that had left so much carnage in his wake, had murdered and terrorized for all that he\u2019d brought them Tim.\u00a0 Jason had snapped out his escrima sticks and engaged <em>immediately</em>, only for Hood to win their brief struggle by nearly choking Jason out and then tying him to the water tank strut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had abandoned yanking free when the tank groaned ominously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a murderer,\u201d Jason snapped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the irony,\u201d Hood laughed, finally looking his way, \u201cFuck, B is going to <em>love</em> this.\u201d\u00a0 The drawl didn\u2019t sound amused. \u00a0\u201cAnd just my luck for landing into this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck are you here anyway?\u201d Jason growled, \u201cYour dimension kick you out for being a sick freak?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Hood said, \u201cI can see the resemblance now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stilled.\u00a0 As far as they knew, Jason\u2019s compatriot hadn\u2019t crossed over into the dimension.\u00a0 It had only been Nightwing, Hood, and Drake.\u00a0 \u201cYeah?\u00a0 What does the version of me have to say about all this?\u201d he jutted his chin out at Hood\u2019s ensemble.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood laughed.\u00a0 It was a bark of a sound that came out jagged through the voice distorter, and it wasn\u2019t entirely amused.\u00a0 \u201cOh, kid,\u201d Hood raised a hand to the latches of the helmet, and it <em>click</em>ed off, \u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t figured it out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The helmet pulled off easily, revealing a red domino mask and a white tuft of hair against all black and a hard jaw and a familiar crooked smirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the first word he could form.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Fraid so,\u201d Hood chuckled, and he was <em>massive</em>, nearly as big as Bruce, and Jason hadn\u2019t managed to reach <em>Dick\u2019s</em> height, how the fuck was this possible?\u00a0 \u201cLike looking in a broken mirror, huh, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a <em>kid</em>,\u201d Jason retorted, searching Hood\u2019s face for any hint of <em>how the fuck this happened</em>.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t imagine\u2014killing?\u00a0 The <em>Red Hood</em>?\u00a0 Using <em>guns</em> after all the violence they\u2019d wrecked on his family?\u00a0 \u201cWhat is <em>wrong</em> with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t wrong with me?\u201d other-him shrugged, \u201cTake your pick, kid.\u00a0 No one\u2019s sure if it\u2019s the Joker, dying, or the Pit that turned me into this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason nearly choked.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Dying</em>?\u201d he spluttered.\u00a0 <em>You don\u2019t look dead</em>, he thought half-hysterically, but most of his thoughts were taken up with <em>I died?!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014how\u2014\u201d <em>when</em>, was that something Jason needed to watch out for, because for all Hood\u2019s bulk, his face was still young, and he couldn\u2019t be more than a year or two older than Jason, if he was older at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Hood shrugged, too sharp to be casual, \u201cI took care of it.\u00a0 You\u2019re not going to die.\u00a0 You get your perfect life with your rich dad and loving family and no anger management issues and a fucking <em>blue </em>costume and an English degree and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLaw,\u201d Jason unstuck his mouth enough to say, cutting off Hood\u2019s increasingly bitter words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m studying pre-law,\u201d Jason clarified, \u201cMinor in English.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood was staring at him with a bemused expression.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Law</em>?\u201d he asked, clearly bewildered, \u201cWhy law?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause good lawyers are rather thin on the ground in Gotham?\u201d Jason raised an eyebrow, \u201cOne of them got half their face melted off and no one wants to take his place.\u201d\u00a0 Because in his internships at the Wayne Foundations, he\u2019d understood the need to work <em>with</em> the system, no matter how much he despised it, to find and exploit the loopholes, to lobby the slow way while Blue got justice the faster way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLaw,\u201d Hood repeated again, like he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are <em>you</em> studying?\u201d Jason asked.\u00a0 He could spot movement out of the corner of his eye.\u00a0 If he kept Hood distracted\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDead kids don\u2019t get to go to college,\u201d Hood said, aiming for cold and missing by a fucking mile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Oh my god</em>, Jason thought, a little wildly, <em>he needs a hug</em>.\u00a0 A <em>lot</em> of hugs.\u00a0 What was that universe\u2019s Dickface <em>doing</em>?\u00a0 What was <em>Bruce</em> doing?\u00a0 Jesus fucking Christ.\u00a0 What about <em>Tim</em>?\u00a0 The baby bird always sat on Jason whenever he was wallowing or coming up with a particularly stupid plan.\u00a0 Did other-Tim not do that?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look solid enough to attend classes,\u201d Jason retorted, keeping his gaze fixed on Hood, \u201cNot going to lie, I\u2019ve seen students that look like ghosts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I <em>can\u2019t</em>,\u201d Hood snapped at him, \u201cAll my legal paperwork says I\u2019m <em>dead</em>, and I\u2019m not creating an alias just to go to college.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something in his heart broke into tiny pieces.\u00a0 Jason had been so excited when Bruce promised he\u2019d get to go to college.\u00a0 He\u2019d hung onto Dick\u2019s every word whenever his older brother returned for the holidays.\u00a0 He\u2019d done so much research into what degree he wanted, what career he wanted, what university\u2014and here Hood was, utterly dismissive of the whole thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s richer than God,\u201d Jason pointed out, \u201cAnd you\u2019re worried about <em>paperwork</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood bared his teeth at him in a growl, and now he <em>definitely</em> looked like an undergrad in finals week hiding from sunlight in the library.\u00a0 It was very disconcerting to take someone who looked like a deadlier version of Batman and slot him in the \u2018actual disaster, defuse with hugs\u2019 category.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Hood could finish that statement, the figures darting closer finally arrived, and Jason let a part of the tension relax as Nightwing\u2014as <em>two</em> Nightwings landed on the rooftop, utterly identical.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Jaybird,\u201d they chirped, eerily in sync.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick listened to the crackle of the line after Hood\u2019s threat, his stomach clenching into a dense knot.\u00a0 Of all his younger siblings, he could admit that he was closest to Jason, who hadn\u2019t let go of Dick for <em>hours</em> after they brought him home, who spent every waking moment trailing after him, who eyed Bruce with suspicion and Alfred with wariness even as he kept a hand fisted in Dick\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His Jaybird.\u00a0 His Little Wing.\u00a0 The happy family Dick had been on the verge of running to the Titans to recreate, and Jason was in <em>danger</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other-him, dressed in an identical Nightwing costume, groaned and facepalmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dick said mildly, \u201cIs this normal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly when Jason\u2019s decided to be extra dramatic,\u201d Nightwing sighed.\u00a0 Dick twitched again at the mention of Hood being <em>Jason</em>.\u00a0 Nightwing\u2019s explanation on that had been windingly convoluted.\u00a0 He suspected on purpose.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt him, I swear, he\u2019s just a little shit sometimes.\u201d\u00a0 Nightwing mimed a strangling motion, \u201c<em>Brothers</em>.\u00a0 Sometimes I want a refund.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dick hummed as forbiddingly as possible.\u00a0 Irritatingly, it didn\u2019t seem to register with Nightwing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe might as well go see why he wants our attention,\u201d Nightwing said, darting a glance at his watch.\u00a0 There was only twenty minutes left.\u00a0 They would be gone soon\u2014if Nightwing was telling the truth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick knew the lengths he would go to keep his siblings safe.\u00a0 He had no doubt that other-him was the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They took to the skies and it was strange, flying with someone who moved so much like him.\u00a0 It felt like looking into a mirror and <em>knowing</em> that the face you saw was not your own.\u00a0 It felt like\u2026home.\u00a0 Like the Flying Graysons were back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Judging by the frequent glances Nightwing was darting at him, he felt the same way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin and Crow were both fine, and both accompanied by their alternates, and neither of <em>those</em> two had shown any aggression according to the all clears.\u00a0 Dick pushed himself faster to get to Jason\u2019s location, and Nightwing matched him unconsciously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they touched down on the right rooftop, it was to Bluebird tied to a support strut and Hood glaring at him, helmet off and arms crossed.\u00a0 Hood was <em>big</em>, almost as big as Bruce, but when he jolted their way, Dick could trace familiar, <em>young</em> features.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Jaybird,\u201d Dick said casually, and Nightwing matched him in eerie synchrony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bluebird stared at them with wide eyes.\u00a0 Hood looked visibly unnerved.\u00a0 \u201cThe <em>fuck</em>,\u201d the man finally said, \u201cWhich one of you is which?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing placed his hands on his hips and did a <em>great</em> job of replicating Alfred\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m disappointed in you and all your life choices\u2019 frown.\u00a0 Dick had never gotten the right eyebrow height down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have to tie him up, Little Wing?\u201d Nightwing said in a long-suffering tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, <em>he</em> attacked <em>me</em>!\u201d Hood held his hands up, \u201cI was just defending myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the ominous threat over the comms?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to head back, I didn\u2019t want to just <em>leave</em> him here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you consider that if you let him keep the comm, he could call for help himself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood was almost pouting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t resist the drama, could you,\u201d Nightwing sighed, looking abruptly world-weary, \u201cGoddamn Bats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and what are you?\u201d Hood asked snidely, ignoring Dick as he moved towards Blue.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re the only one of us who\u2019s worn the furry suit too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that you can distract me from the point,\u201d Nightwing said sternly, doing a better job of staying on track than Dick ever did.\u00a0 Maybe there <em>was</em> something to Bruce\u2019s and Alfred\u2019s frequent complaints that he spoiled his little brothers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dick whispered as he cut Blue free.\u00a0 Nightwing had started a lecture and Hood was sulking.\u00a0 He looked so much like Bruce that Dick wanted to take a picture.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, he didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d Blue wriggled out of the last knots and hopped up, \u201cAside from my ego.\u00a0 <em>Fuck</em>, he\u2019s built like a tank and moves like a goddamn assassin.\u00a0 Surprised the hell out of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMore training then,\u201d Dick wrapped an arm around his shoulders and squeezed him close, \u201cEverything else good?\u201d\u00a0 <em>How do you feel about an alternate version of you being a murderer?</em> he didn\u2019t ask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bluebird said, looking slightly distracted.\u00a0 Nightwing was still scolding Hood, and Bluebird inched towards them.\u00a0 Dick kept an eye on him, but also noted the separate sets of vigilantes hopping across rooftops and heading their way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should apologize,\u201d Nightwing ended his stern lecture, arms crossed, and he looked eerily like Bruce in that instant.\u00a0 It was kind of spooky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Hood could apologize\u2014or, more likely, object, given his obstinate expression\u2014Blue darted forward.\u00a0 \u201cNightwing?\u201d he asked tentatively, and the other-him gave him a startlingly wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick was not jealous.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 That would be stupid.\u00a0 Jason was <em>his</em> little brother, even if the other-Nightwing had found him first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should give Hood more hugs,\u201d Blue said.\u00a0 Nightwing froze, like a stuck tape, and Hood looked like someone had hit him with a fish.\u00a0 There was a rustle as they were joined by the others.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s lonely and he can\u2019t use his words and he uses insults as a defense mechanism but he really wants hugs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s expression was doing something complicated.\u00a0 Hood was swelling up in what looked to be fury, face flushed, and Dick hurriedly stepped to Bluebird\u2019s side to draw him away from the line of fire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone burst out into laughter.\u00a0 \u201c<em>Oh my god</em>,\u201d other-Tim looked like Christmas had come early, \u201cOh my <em>god</em>, this whole thing\u2014the portals, the guy slipping through our fingers four goddamn times, the poisoning, all of it was worth it for <em>this exact moment</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shut up</em>,\u201d Hood growled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that translate to \u2018cuddle me\u2019?\u201d Drake stepped forward with a shit-eating grin and his arms outstretched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a flash, Hood had a gun unholstered and extended, pointed straight at other-Tim\u2019s head.\u00a0 \u201cIt translates to <em>I\u2019ll put a bullet in you if you won\u2019t shut up</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crow gasped and rocked forward, Robin and Bluebird tensed, and Dick kept his gaze on the gun.\u00a0 In contrast, none of the Bats even twitched.\u00a0 Drake only smiled wider.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Nightwing looked tired, \u201cHave I told you all about threatening your siblings with live weaponry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven Hood isn\u2019t stupid enough to forget to turn the safety off, so technically, the weapon isn\u2019t <em>live</em>,\u201d other-Robin pointed out.\u00a0 Hood hissed, and his thumb moved as if to flick the safety off, but they could all see him stop well short of completing the movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drake took advantage of the hesitance and lunged.\u00a0 Despite what Dick had been expecting, Hood made no move to attack him, and only snarled as the younger boy latched onto him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d Hood snapped, making no actual effort to pry Drake off.\u00a0 Bluebird had a satisfied look on his face, as smug as Selina after a museum heist, and Hood bared his teeth at him.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2014I\u2019m going to <em>end</em> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blue shrugged, unconcerned, \u201cNow we\u2019re even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Nightwing said brightly, clapping his hands together, \u201cThank you, Jay, for your astute observations, we\u2019ll be sure to implement them\u2014\u201d Hood growled again\u2014\u201cWe have less than a minute left, kiddos, so say your goodbyes.\u00a0 The girls should\u2019ve already caught the guy, so this is the last time we\u2019ll see each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other-Robin muttered something to Robin before hovering at Nightwing\u2019s side, Drake let go of Hood to have a low-voiced conversation with Crow, and Hood glared at Bluebird, his face red.\u00a0 Dick stayed where he was and met Nightwing\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake care of them,\u201d his alternate dimension counterpart said, smiling softly.\u00a0 His gaze sharpened into something more <em>intent</em>, \u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSame for you,\u201d Dick responded, \u201c\u01b7a Devle\u00e7a.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s expression brightened to an amalgam of painful happiness.\u00a0 \u201cA\u0107h Devle\u00e7a,\u201d he answered, smile tight and sad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stepped back, heading towards Hood, and all the other-Bats converged.\u00a0 They were huddled together for three seconds before a loud <em>screech</em> split the air, and the counterparts vanished.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence reigned in their wake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething is seriously wrong with them,\u201d Crow said finally, and Bluebird snorted. \u00a0\u201cOther-me calls himself <em>Red Robin</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another beat of silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike the <em>restaurant</em>?\u201d Blue squawked and Crow shuddered and nodded.\u00a0 Dick merely shook his head and grabbed Blue in a hug, because he was closest, before waving Crow and Robin to join in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His birds.\u00a0 His little brothers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so glad we don\u2019t live in that universe,\u201d Dick said fervently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>In another dimension\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to <em>god</em>, if you don\u2019t get off of me, I\u2019m going to start decapitating people again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut other-you said you wanted hugs!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and
