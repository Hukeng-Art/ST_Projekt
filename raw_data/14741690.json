  "text": "<p>\n<span>It was an </span>\n<em>\n<span>accident</span>\n</em>\n<span>, no matter what his friends said about it later. Not that he wasn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>disbelieved, </span>\n</em>\n<span>exactly. Just...it always was. An accident, that is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku wasn\u2019t really </span>\n<em>\n<span>used</span>\n</em>\n<span> to being famous. He\u2019d been a hero nerd so long, it just kind of\u2026.slipped his mind that </span>\n<em>\n<span>he</span>\n</em>\n<span> was now a hero- Izuku, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span> rather, was someone to geeked out over. His autograph was worth </span>\n<em>\n<span>money</span>\n</em>\n<span>. His sloppy, rushed signature that most of the time looked like he\u2019d gone for writing \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Izuku</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019, instead of \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019. He had his own merchandise- merchandise that was very high in both supply and demand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(A torn and bloody piece of his uniform had sold at auction for a ridiculous price and Izuku was </span>\n<em>\n<span>not thinking about that.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ever.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It didn\u2019t help that he liked to go to conventions in costume for other heroes. Both the heroes he loved as he grew up and the new heroes that fascinated him. It was something he\u2019d done since he was young, so he didn\u2019t even think about it. When a convention came around, Izuku made a costume and went, invited or not.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even if some of those heroes were now friends, mentors and colleagues. People whose hands he had shaken, heroes he pulled out of the rubble or even engaged in a friendly sparring match. All Might merchandise was even more special now. More precious for the memories he shared with the only father he had ever known.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And while he was at the conventions, the casual \u2018geeking out\u2019 over heroes wasn\u2019t anything odd. It was what </span>\n<em>\n<span>happened</span>\n</em>\n<span> at Hero Cons. Joining in the conversations while he was on the floor was second nature, as was taking pictures and having heated arguments on whose quirk was better suited for one thing or another. He was also just as excited about the heroes as the rest of the attendees, all decked out in their own costumes, their own merch, so why would he hesitate? He\u2019d always done so, even when he was still Quirkless and rushing around in his first attempts at sewing anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The problem, Izuku found, was that there were quite a few times that the crowd was fanboying over </span>\n<em>\n<span>him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He always had to take a minute when he realized, when all their voices echoed and in loud ringing tones and breathless whispers around him-\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>He\u2019s so cool!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Did you see what he did last week with the Jolt Villains?! One of them had a water Quirk and the other had electricity! They worked really well together, and they managed to shock Deku more than once but he just kept </span>\n</em>\n<span>going!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>He\u2019s a hero, ya know? And that means a lot to me- he\u2019s not one of those heroes that doesn\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>care</span>\n<em>\n<span> about his fans!\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Yeah, did you see that video of Deku at last year\u2019s Con? One of his fans was talking during the Q&amp;A and mentioned how they struggled with depression and panic attacks and some other things, and he </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>literally</em>\n</b>\n<em>\n<span> climbed off the stage to hug her and talk her down from a panic attack! It was just- It really stuck with me. That he just </span>\n</em>\n<span>did that</span>\n<em>\n<span>.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>He\u2019s Number One for a reason!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>He makes me feel safe. Even when he\u2019s not right next to me, I know he\u2019s out there, somewhere, and that\u2019s really comforting to me.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-and Izuku just wanted to </span>\n<em>\n<span>cry</span>\n</em>\n<span> because </span>\n<em>\n<span>this</span>\n</em>\n<span> was what he wanted to do when he was small. </span>\n<em>\n<span>This</span>\n</em>\n<span> was his dream and it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>happening</span>\n</em>\n<span> and Izuku couldn\u2019t believe it sometimes. Sometimes it felt like a dream. Sometimes he could hear all those voices from his childhood- </span>\n<em>\n<span>Quirkless. Helpless. Useless. You can never be a hero like that!</span>\n</em>\n<span>- and it just-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t true. He was here, he was standing at the </span>\n<em>\n<span>top</span>\n</em>\n<span> and the world looked at him and </span>\n<em>\n<span>smiled</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>inspired</span>\n</em>\n<span> people. To some, they had never even known All Might as the No. 1 hero. For their lives, it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So the whole \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>not telling his fans</span>\n</em>\n<span> that he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Pro Hero Deku\u2019,</span>\n</em>\n<span> the world\u2019s Number One, while he flailed over the newest hero video and got into video breakdowns with them, was an honest accident. Really, his name should be common knowledge, especially after the Sports Festivals, but a great deal of people had no idea who Midoriya Izuku was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which was what he introduced himself as, rather then the titles. Dozens of conventions, dozens of costumes, his name was well known in lots of areas. He\u2019d been doing cons for </span>\n<em>\n<span>years</span>\n</em>\n<span> before he was a Pro, and he planned to </span>\n<em>\n<span>keep</span>\n</em>\n<span> doing it, so really it was no surprise that Izuku never thought of himself as </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span> while he was traveling the floor. Nor that any familiarity people saw in him was quickly explained with his sheer amount of participation in the fan industry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, the only real difference to going to the Hero Cons now vs when he was younger, was that he was</span>\n<em>\n<span> invited to them</span>\n</em>\n<span> instead of buying a ticket.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku bounced on his toes, burying his face into the capture weapon wrapped around his neck. It was an authentic weapon, as he had asked Hitoshi for Aizawa-sensei\u2019s weaponized scarf. Or rather, a spare that wasn\u2019t in use. An older model. One that wouldn\u2019t be missed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d chosen to cosplay Aizawa-sensei this year. It was easier to do now that Aizawa-sensei was the principal of UA (and now that Hitoshi had spares of his mentor\u2019s uniform), as he was rather well known in his older years. Being the Sensei to </span>\n<em>\n<span>Class 3-A</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and surviving the July Attacks, as well as being chosen for the role of Principal for </span>\n<em>\n<span>UA</span>\n</em>\n<span>- he was rather famous really, even if he hated it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya would never miss a chance to cosplay one of his favorite people and teachers. (Especially when Aizawa wouldn\u2019t yell at him about it. Other than a muttered, \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>problem child\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> with an exasperated affection in his voice and even though Sensei might have been annoyed or especially sleep deprived, it wasn\u2019t hard to tell that the way he said it was really more fond than angry so </span>\n<em>\n<span>there.</span>\n</em>\n<span>)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The makeup he was wearing to hide his freckles, mimic stubble, change his facial shape subtly,\u00a0 and recreate Aizawa\u2019s scars alongside the contacts and wig kept his identity underwraps. That Izuku really liked the capture weapon- fully functioning and able to be used if needed, also </span>\n<em>\n<span>soft</span>\n</em>\n<span>- and buried his face into it only helped. The black jumpsuit type of uniform Eraserhead favored was easy to cosplay and hid his own easily identifiable scars. It was also comfortable enough that if something happened, he could quickly move around in it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku had no idea </span>\n<em>\n<span>how</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ochako had managed to get those expensive fleshy bits of fake skin that covered the entirety of scars on his hands and wrists, but as he had forgotten to cover them at the last minute, he wasn\u2019t complaining.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d been stopped for over two dozen pictures already and Izuku had to fight to keep his face blank the way he knew Eraserhead would when all he wanted to do was smile. Some had asked for the manic grin the man was known for giving in the very rare photos that always managed to surface on the fan forums. Those had become a popular meme several years ago, along with the caption, \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>logical ruse!\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span>. His class had collectively </span>\n<em>\n<span>lost their minds</span>\n</em>\n<span> when they saw it, and it had been a constant sight in the group chat. It still was, at every opportunity, used liberally by the class. A game had also been born as when A-3 stopped by UA, they made it a challenge to hide a copy of the meme somewhere in Aizawa\u2019s office, in a variety of sizes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako held the record for longest hidden copy, but Tsuyu was a close second.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hero Cons were the </span>\n<em>\n<span>absolute best</span>\n</em>\n<span> place to get Merchandise. Rare, limited edition, one-of-a-kind, newly released and even discounted. They had </span>\n<em>\n<span>everything</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Plus some of the fanart on sale was </span>\n<em>\n<span>gorgeous</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He\u2019d already bought a few pieces for his friends </span>\n<em>\n<span>and</span>\n</em>\n<span> himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d found one of Tail Man, leaping out of the page, his body mid-turn and his tail coming around for an obviously powerful blow. It had been done in chalk pastels and the </span>\n<em>\n<span>colors</span>\n</em>\n<span> had been stunning. The way it had been blended...Izuku had grabbed it immediately, knowing that Ojiro would love it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(It hung on the wall in a place of honor and Izuku smiled, a tiny little thing, every time he saw it.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d spent twenty minutes at the vendor who was selling the chalk pastel drawings gushing over them and making the boy behind the counter blush and stammer. He\u2019d also bought another one of Froppy, because the </span>\n<em>\n<span>number of blended colors</span>\n</em>\n<span> he could see for the water </span>\n<em>\n<span>alone</span>\n</em>\n<span> was glorious, much less the mid-air twist the artist had drawn Froppy doing over the lake in the glen he had placed her in.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The artist had obviously seen their subjects in action or done a fair amount of research, as all the details were nearly </span>\n<em>\n<span>perfect.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Izuku was in </span>\n<em>\n<span>awe.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next piece of artwork to join his collection was an acrylic painting of Uravity as a space goddess, floating in the middle of their solar system, cradling Earth in her palms, larger than life and glowing and gorgeous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d seen one of himself on the walls of the vender stand, decked out like a knight, face twisted with determination, a smile stretching his lips, and an </span>\n<em>\n<span>I Dare You</span>\n</em>\n<span> look in his eyes despite the scuffed and dented armor he wore, his sword lifted out of the page at an unseen enemy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Izuku had taken a moment to discreetly wipe the swell of tears from his eyes.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto had been a beautiful painting of an Elemental, his fire and ice crawling up the page and almost looking like Izuku could reach out and touch it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was so </span>\n<em>\n<span>good</span>\n</em>\n<span> and in that moment, Izuku couldn\u2019t help himself. He bought two of every picture he saw for Class 3-A as well as pocketed the artist's business card. He\u2019d make sure they got a copy of each piece of art mailed back with autographs.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The vendor looked like a breeze would knock him over when Izuku bought the lot. He made quite a lot of money and original, one-of-a-kind art required a rather large price tag. That he </span><em><span>bought</span></em> <em><span>the lot</span></em><span> was absolutely going to keep the artist well fed and supplied until the next annual con. He\u2019d have to get a vehicle to bring it back to his room, but it was well worth it.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku\u2019s favorite things to find though, had to be the hero merch for </span>\n<em>\n<span>Toshinori</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Not All Might, but </span>\n<em>\n<span>Toshi</span>\n</em>\n<span> as he was, skinny and true. It had made a slow appearance over the years after the fight that revealed it all, even when the scars of Kamino were still fresh. The first time Deku had seen it, it had been during his first year as an official Pro, already very popular thanks to the July Attacks and his work while interning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The vendor had </span>\n<em>\n<span>flipped</span>\n</em>\n<span> when they recognized Deku, their hair turning a familiar shade of green, thanks to Izuku fanboying over All Might in front of their stand. The fact he was in cosplay hadn\u2019t phased the teen, they\u2019d </span>\n<em>\n<span>known</span>\n</em>\n<span> the instant Deku went on one of his famous rants who they were looking at. Obviously a dedicated and observant watcher that Deku could respect.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Without hesitation, Deku had bought the entire collection of artwork the vendor had done for Toshinori, and then signed a small collection of work for the teen with a grin on his face. The shell-shocked, dazzled look on the artist\u2019s face made his day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku had no way of knowing that, as he walked away with bags and bags of merchandise, practically floating to his hotel room to drop it off- he\u2019d planned to distribute some of it among his classmates- the teenager he\u2019d left at the vendor stand practically melted into the floor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>However, their reaction drew some attention, even if most people minded their own business, caught up in their own cosplay and the glimmering of the lights.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The teen had slid bonelessly to the floor, where, after landing face down, they had laid until their best friend came back from checking out the rest of the vendors. There was amusement on his face, but as they watched, a small touch of concern furrowed his forehead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDude, what happened to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The vendor had let out a small shriek of sound, flailing a bit on the ground, incoherent words dissolving into a high pitched whine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTakeshi, dude, I need you to speak words- wait. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Wait! No way! Takeshi, where did you get the signed Deku works?!</span>\n</em>\n<span> I know you didn\u2019t have them earlier! I helped you unload all of this! And- are you missing an entire section of your work? I was gone, like, ten minutes max! </span>\n<em>\n<span>How</span>\n</em>\n<span> did you sell it all so quickly?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Takeshi screamed into the floor and okay, now he was definitely worried. His best friend\u2019s hair cycled through at least half a dozen colors in as many seconds, a sure sign their emotions were all over the place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI met </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Takeshi\u2019s voice was a wheeze and across from them, their friend </span>\n<em>\n<span>stilled,</span>\n</em>\n<span> arms frozen mid motion, and his mouth dropping open as disbelief and wonder painted itself all across his freckled face.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\u201cNo </span><em><span>fuckin\u2019</span></em> <em><span>way</span></em><span>.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>\u201cNo, no </span><em><span>you don\u2019t understand Taro. He bought my entire stock on Tiny Might.</span></em><span> Deku likes my art. </span><em><span>Deku likes my art and he bought all of it </span></em><b><em>and</em></b> <b><em>then</em></b><em><span> signed my fanart of him when I didn\u2019t even ask.\u201d</span></em></p>\n<p>\n<span>Takeshi looked like their entire world had just been shaken up like a snowglobe. When they finally lifted their face off the ground and then sat up, Taro could clearly see they were reverently cradling their sketchbook to their chest and, judging by the sheer awe and wonder on their face, appeared as if they were one word away from breaking into tears.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They flipped the sketchbook around for Taro to see, revealing the open page.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Your art is really amazing, and it brings a smile to my face! Keep on drawing, no matter what! I hope to see you again next year.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>The charcoal pieces are my favorite, they have really amazing contrast!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You Can Do It!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>-Deku</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Any Hero Convention that Izuku went in the many years he had been attending since becoming a Hero, had developed a tradition on the last day of the convention.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t one he had started on purpose, but usually when he came out on stage for all his panels, he was never in his cosplay. It was always jeans and t-shirts. Every single t-shirt was one from his friends' merchandise lines, or a joke gift from Momo. A high honor among his friends, to see which shirt Izuku wore for Hero Con.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Over the years, those included some such as-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A t-shirt that said, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Speed Racer,</span>\n</em>\n<span> over his chest, with an Ingenium helmet under the words.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One that had Sato\u2019s muscles drawn on the front and sleeves while the back had </span>\n<em>\n<span>Sugar Rush</span>\n</em>\n<span> across his shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Another that had Dark Shadow and Tokoyami mid-attack and in white over the picture the worlds, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Hello Darkness, my Old Friend</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One of his favorites was from Momo, as a subtle nod to Hitoshi, in black with purple words across the chest reading, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Did I Make Your Mind Blank?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Half-and-Half Shouto tee\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tsuyu\u2019s face with a stamp that read, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ribbit!.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All sorts really.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But the tradition started after his first convention, when Ochako had mentioned that none of his fans had gotten to see his cosplay.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Usually, Izuku had multiple cosplays set for the Conventions, so he would choose his favorite, and on the last panel he had, he would step out in costume.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This was where most of his fans flipped out, suddenly realizing </span>\n<em>\n<span>they had talked to Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Deku fanboyed over my hero merch.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Deku got into a loud attention grabbing debate in the middle of the lobby with a whole powerpoint presentation in that battered notebook</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>That was DEKU I asked for pictures.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or, as the case happened- </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku asked </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>me for a picture</em>\n</b>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His friends always thought it was hilarious. Izuku never thought about it until his fans started screaming in the crowd, or grabbing the nearest stranger and shaking them. Eyes wide, faces glowing in sheer joy and disbelief, all smiles and some even with tears trailing down their cheeks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the middle of the convention, Izuku never thought about it, but on that last day someone always reminded him to show off his cosplay. Izuku always loved to share, and was entirely too happy to explain the \u2018hows\u2019 of making the cosplay if he was asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There were a few videos showing a tutorial or four on how he had managed the really difficult pieces.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One of the most popular videos was of Detonation standing in costume with Deku in sweats and a bright red </span>\n<em>\n<span>MANLY</span>\n</em>\n<span> tank top poking at his costume while surrounded by half constructed pieces of his Detonation cosplay.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The video ended with Katsuki body slamming Izuku over his coffee table and taking out the camera in the process while Shouto yelled in the background \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>don\u2019t break the table!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019 and Barkugou barking at the loud noise.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A lot of the time, Deku ended up signing pictures of his old cosplays once his fans knew it was him. It became a game for the few fans that were </span>\n<em>\n<span>in the know</span>\n</em>\n<span> that Deku stayed true to his roots as a hero otaku.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>This year however, Izuku only had the Eraserhead cosplay, a series of villain attacks throughout the month leading up to the con having kept him from making multiples.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He found that fanartist he had met during his first con in the same booth they always rented out and he smiled. Takeshi always had new Toshi art for him, and Deku made a point to visit every year.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Takeshi refused to let Deku </span>\n<em>\n<span>buy</span>\n</em>\n<span> anything if they figured out it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span> they were selling to, so Izuku always tried to hide who he was until after he\u2019d made the purchase. He had a tradition of signing some of the works Takeshi did of him, choosing the ones he really liked, and always offering constructive advice to him for his art.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Perhaps he should have expected it, really. Class 3-A as a whole had always had the devil\u2019s luck. Especially when it came to broken arms. Not that it was his arm this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still he didn\u2019t expect the attack in the middle of the convention, right in the heart of the vendor\u2019s floor. And, as per his Class\u2019 luck, the force of the villain\u2019s first attack sent Deku flying off his own feet and straight into the vendor table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instinct kicked in as soon as his feet left the ground, and without missing a beat, Deku landed on the table with his hands, spinning himself around in a breakdance move he had learned from Mina, and throwing himself off of the table back onto his feet facing the origin of the attack, eyes narrowed and body low to the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not a single piece of his cosplay was displaced in the mess.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(</span>\n<em>\n<span>The lucky cosplayer with a quirk that allowed her to record everything she saw and download into a phone would make a pretty hefty sum off the ensuing video, but that is for after the con.)</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The villain laughed, standing on a broken table, crushing the delicate snowglobes of heroes in miniature he\u2019d just been admiring and Izuku was </span>\n<em>\n<span>not happy.</span>\n</em>\n<span> He was </span>\n<em>\n<span>enjoying</span>\n</em>\n<span> himself, and this was a time for everyone to get together and enjoy themselves. Villains should know better than to attack a place like this.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, didn\u2019t they know that </span>\n<em>\n<span>he was here?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku lifted his hands, face hard and eyes already starting to shine with the power of One For All, grabbing the end of the capture weapon around his neck, loosening the wrappings and mentally thanking Aizawa-sensei for teaching him how to use the weapon properly. He darted forward with a feral smile on his lips, just as he always did, as adrenaline rushed through his veins.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The villain was better than Deku had given them credit for. It didn\u2019t help that he </span>\n<em>\n<span>apparently</span>\n</em>\n<span> had accomplices in the crowd. Deku jumped back toward Takeshi\u2019s table, quickly pulling the wig off of his head and shoving it into the vendor\u2019s hands with a quick-</span>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cHold this, please!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-before he rushed forward again, Full Cowl sparking to life around his frame. He ignored the way his shirt began to dissolve against the sparking energy of his Quirk, the cosplay material not up to handling the rush of energy. He spared a brief apology to Ochako because he\u2019s pretty sure the fake bits of flesh that she used to cover his scars burnt off right along with the fabric.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire fight ended up blazing across headlines, and Deku covered his face any time someone showed him the GIFsets that had been made from it, embarrassment turning his face red. The incredibly popular GIFsets that were going to be on the internet </span>\n<em>\n<span>forever.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fan favorites ranged from Deku with red eyes- thanks to his contacts- shoving his wig into Takeshi\u2019s hands- the utterly baffled, yet bemused look on Takeshi\u2019s face was </span>\n<em>\n<span>hilarious</span>\n</em>\n<span>- the slow motion dissolving of his shirt- </span>\n<em>\n<span>hello muscles</span>\n</em>\n<span>- to the clip of him straightening up out of crouch over the villain. Still shirtless apart from the capture scarf he had used to tie up the lot before police arrived.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was a great deal of smooth skin and flexing muscles accented by splashes of scars, both pale, faded and shiny pink.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku avoided the comment section like the </span>\n<em>\n<span>plague</span>\n</em>\n<span> and made himself scarce when one of his friends, in a show of dramatics, read them aloud, complete with theatrical voices and </span>\n<em>\n<span>sounds.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Perhaps the most famous instance among Deku fans was the time that Izuku attended a Hero Panel that </span>\n<em>\n<span>didn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> have him on the panel itself. Instead, he had been in the audience itself, dressed up as All Might.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The panel had ended up becoming a live debate comparing the Number One heroes- past and present- Deku and All Might.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku had listened to the entire thing wide eyed and shocked as the fans bounced the argument around the room between themselves. The Panel, being a collection of \u2018up and coming\u2019 heroes rather than any older Pros all tended to side with \u2018Deku\u2019 as being the better of the two.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku ended up standing up in the middle of the crowd and debunking all of them with a rant about how All Might was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Number One</span>\n</em>\n<span>, even among the other number ones. All Might had established </span>\n<em>\n<span>what it meant</span>\n</em>\n<span> to </span>\n<em>\n<span>be</span>\n</em>\n<span> Number One. There was </span>\n<em>\n<span>only</span>\n</em>\n<span> a Number One because </span>\n<em>\n<span>All Might</span>\n</em>\n<span> carved that spot out with a single disaster, a single video and then </span>\n<em>\n<span>held it</span>\n</em>\n<span> for almost </span>\n<em>\n<span>forty years.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looking back it was rather ridiculous and sort of embarrassing, but Izuku couldn\u2019t help himself. The debate never resulted in raised voices, but it did get rather...</span>\n<em>\n<span>intense.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It go so intense actually, that Izuku ended up sitting up on the panel itself, metaphorically on his own little soap box, as he waved his arms- </span>\n<em>\n<span>he\u2019d picked up some habits from Tenya-</span>\n</em>\n<span> and enthusiastically played support for All Might in a room full of people who mostly were raised on stories of </span>\n<em>\n<span>him</span>\n</em>\n<span> as Number One.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku would have continued to debate with the room at large, except at the back of the hall, someone kicked the doors open with a loud and barking, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oi!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span>, as everyone went </span>\n<em>\n<span>silent</span>\n</em>\n<span>. When Izuku looked up, a spark of One For All shivering up his body,\u00a0 he couldn\u2019t stop the instinctive shout of, \u201cKacchan!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDeku, you dumb fuck, you were supposed to be at your panel ten minutes ago- </span>\n<em>\n<span>we\u2019re waiting on you!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The room was so quiet one could have heard a pin drop as Izuku stood, sheepishly rubbing the back of his head as embarrassment painted itself all over his features.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u201cAh- excuse me, sorry everyone! I\u2019m running late,\u201d Izuku dipped into an embarrassed bow before he crouched out, muscles bunching before launching himself above the heads of everyone crowding the stage and gently landed beside Kacchan, before Detonation grabbed him and roughly dragged him out, griping at the number one hero. Behind them, Deku\u2019s whine of, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Kacchan!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span> cut off as the doors shut quietly behind them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as the door closed, a straight wall of noise rose up so quickly, it sounded like a mini explosion went off behind the doors. All over the panel room, fans started screaming and jumping to their feet, phones out, fingers pointing as the realization of what just happened settled into the air.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This </span>\n<em>\n<span>included</span>\n</em>\n<span> the up and coming Pros, who reached over to each other and started yelling about how they had </span>\n<em>\n<span>sat next to Deku</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and can you </span>\n<em>\n<span>believe it, </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>oh my god</em>\n</b>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was chaos in the room as everyone inside realized at the exact same time that they had been collectively </span>\n<em>\n<span>debating why Deku was the Best </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>with Deku</em>\n</b>\n<em>\n<span> dressed like </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>All Might</em>\n</b>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the next few minutes, it suddenly hit the entire room that </span>\n<em>\n<span>Deku\u2019s Panel Started</span>\n</em>\n<span> and the crowd surged as several hundred people immediately scrambled for the door. Needless to say, it was a mad dash for the suddenly bottlenecked passage out of the auditorium.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire panel had been captured on video- later named </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018The Great Debate\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> and referred to by fans as that or \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>The Debate Incident</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019- and it was exceedingly popular, with spikes in views every other week. That video quickly hit the top of Japan\u2019s Most Viewed videos and had no trouble staying there for quite some time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There were multiple comments on the video laughing about the chaos Deku left in his wake, as well as the mad scramble for the doors by everyone there- even the Pros- when they remembered that Deku\u2019s Panel had started.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Pro-Heroes were not excluded from this either. The comments section included some very big names leaving behind laughing emojis and exasperated comments on how like Deku it was to be so caught up in defending All Might he forgot his own panel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In their homes, the entire class of 3-A snickered or outright laughed when seeing the video. Even with the massive amount of fame, the high dollar missions he took, the billboards and advertisements with his face plastered all over them, Deku remained the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>10 Questions Answered By Number One Hero, Deku, and Which One Surprised Us the Most!</b>\n</p>\n<p>It was only six months after the aforementioned con that Deku had been asked about one of the more memorable moments with fans.</p>\n<p>Deku had paused for a second, a single face and a single incident coming to mind. He smiled and settled into the retelling of this story a touch more seriously then before. He was slower, a bit quieter as he spoke and easily held us as his interviewers captive with the splay of emotions he didn\u2019t hide.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll change the names for privacy reasons but\u2026ironically enough, as all my best moments tend to be, I was at Hero Con. \u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the bright red shoes he sees first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a lot of bright red shoes, easily dismissed as cosplay for Deku, casual or otherwise. But these- <em> these </em> are not the shoes worn by <em> Deku, </em> these are the ones worn by <em> Izuku Midoriya. </em></p>\n<p>Quirkless people, with the extra toe joint, with a missing bit of evolution, who need that extra support for that one part of their anatomy that is different from those who developed a Quirk.</p>\n<p>Any Quirkless would recognize that brand. Izuku doesn\u2019t know if the fans at large know the significance of those bright red sneakers, but for this child he sees, tiny body jerking itself around as if searching for someone not there\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em> Izuku knows. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s cosplaying himself at this con. In the very first version of his uniform, with his face covered, made by his mother with normal fabric, not the special Hero-Grade fabrics he wears almost exclusively today.</p>\n<p>He takes a breath and makes a beeline towards the child, weaving through the crowd until the child stands in front of him- dressed in a rendition of All Might\u2019s Silver Age costume with Deku\u2019s iconic red sneakers.</p>\n<p>Black fluffy hair, wide blue eyes set in the face of a child barely 10 years old.</p>\n<p>Time seems to slow as a small space is carved around them, when Izuku lowers himself down to kneel in front of her, a smile curving his lips, as he gently tugs his hood back so his smile is visible.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Izuku says as blue eyes go <em> wide </em> in recognition, as her jaw drops in awe. \u201cI\u2019m Deku. Are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>A moment, then another. A gleam of tears, then the girl snaps her jaw shut and leans forward, something desperate and despairing stealing over her so quickly, Izuku cannot help but see himself looking back.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Can someone without a Quirk be like you? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cCan I be a hero like you?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>The ghost of Izuku\u2019s past, here and now, a lifetime later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, he doesn\u2019t answer. A beat of silence and her expression doesn\u2019t change.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaru Tanaka. I want to be a <em> hero. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Haru says it like it\u2019s the only thing she will ever want. She says it like it hurts, like if she says it enough, if she says it <em> loud </em> enough, it\u2019ll mean something more. That someone will <em> look at her </em> and say, \u201c <em> You\u2019ll be a great hero!\u201d </em>.</p>\n<p>In the exact way only one person has ever told a Quirkless child so long ago.</p>\n<p>Izuku wants to cry, wants to scream that she can from the top of the tallest building he can jump to. A second later, It\u2019s Deku that reaches out and hugs her. It\u2019s Deku that tells her-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are very brave.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> Izuku </em> that tightens his arms, it\u2019s <em> Izuku </em> that whispers as fiercely as he can into her ear-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are enough, all by yourself. You can be anything you want, as long as you work hard enough for it. It won\u2019t be easy. It will be hard. People will tell you that you <em> can\u2019t. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Her breath is hitching as her hands grip tightly into his costume, the one his mother made with all the love and care, just the same as Haru\u2019s parent probably made her own costume and Izuku\u2019s heart aches.</p>\n<p>It was so long ago. The words of the teachers at Aldera, of his classmates, of <em> Kacchan. </em> They still tug at him, almost a decade later. He can barely remember their names, their faces, but their words stick in his memory all these years later.</p>\n<p>What All Might said to him on that rooftop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt,\u201d he says to this girl, as his own scars pull his skin. \u201cBut you can figure out a way to do it and go as far as you can, for as long as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls back, waiting until she raises damp eyes to meet his and gives her his fiercest smile, lets One For All shine and spark from his gaze and says with every single bit of iron and steel in his voice-</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I believe in you.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Haru looks like she can\u2019t believe him. A second in disbelief, a dawning realization that <em> someone believes her. </em> That the <em> Number One Hero </em> believes <em> her. </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of stillness when her face scrunches up like she\u2019s going to start crying again before a blinding grin chases that away.</p>\n<p>Izuku grins back, just as bright, mirroring the joy he sees shining in Haru.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be the best,\u201d Haru declares, viciously, ecstatically and sniffs as a tear slides down her cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHARU!\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Deku and Haru look up at the same moment a harried man with white hair, expression very visibly distraught, pushes roughly through the crowd.</p>\n<p>Izuku tugs his mask back down and moves back, as far as the tight grip Haru has on his costume will allow. The man collapses to his knees by their side, already reaching for her as two white rabbit ears fall around his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Deku soothes, voice automatically falling into the familiar tones of a hero calming a citizen down. \u201cI found Haru-chan wandering so I figured I\u2019d keep her company while waiting for her parent. Is that you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro Tanaka, Hero- er, Stranger-san. Haru-\u201d</p>\n<p>Haru cuts her father off, eyes shining and gaze still fixated on Deku.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be a <em> hero. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku can see exactly how those words hit the man. The exact way his own words hit his mother. He also knows exactly how Haru feels when her father makes that face, that face that he still sometimes dreams of on kaa-san.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaru-chan,\u201d Deku states with all the gravitas he holds, a spark of One for All in his gaze as Shiro Tanaka jerks around to double take at him in something like dawning realization. \u201cCould be a hero if she works hard, if she is determined to be a hero, then <em> she will be. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t say, <em> even if I have to ensure it myself. </em> Doesn\u2019t add, <em> I will make this world a place for people like </em> us. Won\u2019t explain, <em> those shoes are so easy for me to recognize. </em></p>\n<p>Shiro looks exhausted. Despairing, bewildered, confused and even a touch angry. Deku doesn\u2019t mind, he and Haru have already spoken all they need to say.</p>\n<p>Deku rises to his feet, a smooth, graceful movement and tugs his mask down firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook for me,\u201d he murmurs so Haru can hear him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the spotlight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd twists and turns around him and before Haru\u2019s father can act on whatever he\u2019s planning to say to the stranger who he thinks has egged his daughter on in some suicidal stunt in a makeshift attempt at compassion-</p>\n<p>Deku melts into the crowd, vanishing in between one second and then another.</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s ears twitch against his head and he turns to his daughter, only to be taken aback by the fierce and vibrant joy he can see in her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaru-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He is hesitant in asking, almost unsure on what he wants to know, but his daughter merely smiles wide and meets his eyes with more life than he\u2019s seen in <em> months. </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I can be a hero like that. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWe are proud to welcome the Number One Hero! The Can Do Hero! DEKU!! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pulling the cowl off, he\u2019s reaching for the microphone. He\u2019s resplendent in his costume, he\u2019s shining and haloed in light, bathed in the cheers of a thousand people and Deku says nothing for a long, long moment.</p>\n<p>Then, as the noise dies down, as a murmuring quiet falls on the auditorium, Pro Hero Deku says only a single sentence before lightning erupts across his skin and he vanishes in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou can be a hero, I believe in you.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMany don\u2019t know,\u201d Deku says, after a brief, stunned silence. \u201cThat my Quirk didn\u2019t present itself until a short time before the UA Entrance Exam.\u201d</p>\n<p>Into that disbelieving silence, Deku continues as if dropping this unexpected bombshell was nothing more than a hint of added context.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was effectively Quirkless for fifteen years. I wore the red shoes. I was mocked, insulted, bullied, suicide baited and I can tell you right now my teachers not only did <em> nothing, </em> they actively encouraged those with Quirks to practice on me. I was only Quirkless, after all. No one cares about Quirkless people. I had no future, no worth. Those with Quirks could only climb, could only improve their chances using me as some sort of stepping stone in their eyes. It was all the worth they saw in a Quirkless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deku ignores the gaping mouths, the shocked expressions and continues with this never before mentioned look into the Number One Hero\u2019s childhood before UA.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Quirk is a special one, and I won\u2019t go into much detail concerning it, but I shouldn\u2019t have been less simply because I didn\u2019t have a Quirk. A Quirk does not make a person any less or any more deserving of <em> anything. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- But you have a Quirk now? You are a Hero- <em> the </em> Number O-\u201d</p>\n<p>Deku\u2019s voice is cold, hard and sends shivers up our spines when he interrupts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. You can be a hero without a Quirk. There are dangers to being a Hero without a quirk, I won\u2019t lie. But having a quirk did not make me a hero. I made myself a hero, through hard work, through the support of so many other people, with blood, sweat and tears. I will not promise an easy journey, but you <em> can </em> be a hero. You have to work hard. You have to listen to people treat you as if you are <em> lesser </em> because of your <em> lack </em> . You are denied careers, relationships, scholarships. Hospitals will help those with Quirks before they see to your care, if they see you at all. You are Quirkless and society <em> does not want you </em> is one of the first things you figure out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pro Hero Deku takes a breath and clenches his fists.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was four.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence falls and for a moment, the stunned expressions, the shock, the confusion begins to turn into something awkward and uncomfortable. No one talks about the Quirkless. We as the interviewers did not know what to say. Did not know how to continue.</p>\n<p>Deku speaks again and his words will be something many of us will remember for a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love Japan. I love the people around me, my friends and family. The fans who look up to me. Everyone knows my name, my face and I am compared to All Might and held to the same standards. But I will always remember being a child and being told I cannot be a hero because I do not have a Quirk. I am unwanted by society because I am worthless without a Quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a lie,\u201d he continued softly, but firmly. \u201cOne, that if I had listened to it, I would have thrown myself off a roof almost a decade ago and only a single person would have mourned my passing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs such, I am now letting the public know that a resource center for Quirkless people has been opened next to my agency. It is open to the public, both for Quirkless, for people with so called \u201cvillainous quirks\u201d and anyone who needs help. We will be retaining a Quirk Counselor on our staff\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>Click to Read More on the Can Do Hero, Deku\u2019s Surprising Answer And His Solution!</b>\n</p>\n<p>Shiro Tanaka sits back in his chair, a hand pressed tightly over his mouth as tears gather in the corner of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Deku. </em>\n</p>\n<p>His hand moves the mouse, pulling up picture, after picture, after picture of Deku, of Izuku Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Red.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Red. </em>\n</p>\n<p><b> <em>Red</em> </b>.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Red shoes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>The same that his daughter wears.</p>\n<p>Shiro folds his arms, buries his face in them and <em> weeps. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers even though no one can hear him. \u201c<em> Thank you for being there.\u201d </em></p>"
