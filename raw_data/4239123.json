  "text": "<p>\u201cHey, Foggy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Foggy looks up from tying his shoe and waits for Matt to say whatever it is he wants to say. After a little more than a week, he\u2019s still learning to read his new roommate\u2019s face - the \u201cno eye contact\u201d thing makes it tricky - but he thinks Matt looks uncertain. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you...ah\u2026\u201d Matt\u2019s fingers curl around the handle of his cane like a security blanket. He\u2019s already got his jacket and shoes on, ready to head down to the coffee shop before their first classes of the day. \u201cCould you guide me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy blinks. Matt\u2019s asked him for help before, but with little things like reading signs and screens, never with getting around. Foggy maybe should\u2019ve offered, but he didn\u2019t want to stick his foot in his mouth more than he had when they met - and besides, Matt never seems to <i>need</i> help getting around. Sure, he has the cane, and he gropes for seats and doors, but there\u2019s a confidence to the way he moves, a certain surefooted grace that Foggy can never hope to emulate no matter <i>how</i> good his eyes are.</p>\n<p>He must\u2019ve hesitated too long, because Matt\u2019s fingers tighten on the cane. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Foggy says quickly. \u201cI just...are you okay? It\u2019s just that you\u2019re always, like. Mr. Independent. Like Kelly Clarkson.\u201d Foggy is an <i>idiot</i>.</p>\n<p>Matt lets out one of those little surprised laughs of his, the ones that always make Foggy feel oddly triumphant. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. I can get around with just the cane, it\u2019s just...a little easier with someone guiding me. But I don\u2019t like to ask until...until I know the other person.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s glad Matt can\u2019t tell how warm his cheeks are right now. Whatever, it\u2019s totally manly to be touched when your cool new roommate trusts you not to walk him into a wall. \u201cWhat if I lead you off a cliff?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can see Matt relaxing at the joke, the furrow between his brows easing. Once again, being ridiculous serves Foggy well. \u201cOne of the many cliffs we have here in Manhattan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere could be hundreds of them. How would you even know?\u201d Foggy counters. He finishes off his shoelace and stands up. \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Matt moves towards his voice, left hand out. \u201cI\u2019ll hold on to your elbow. Just say if there are stairs, or if we\u2019re crossing the street, stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy holds his right elbow out like he\u2019s doing half a chicken dance. He\u2019s sure it looks awkward as hell, but hey, Matt can\u2019t see it. \u201cElbow\u2019s fine, but just so you know, I don\u2019t hold a boy\u2019s hand until after we\u2019re pinned.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt laughs again. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re guarding your virtue closely. Very admirable.\u201d</p>\n<p>His fingertips bump Foggy\u2019s arm and drag around the curve of it to nest in the crook of his arm. Foggy loosens the bend of it to give him more room. Matt\u2019s grip is light but unmistakable, a warm presence through Foggy\u2019s sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis okay?\u201d Matt asks.</p>\n<p>Next to him like this, Foggy can see the line of Matt\u2019s profile; the slope of his nose, the way his upper lip pushes up into his cupid\u2019s bow. His eyes are normally hidden by his glasses, but here, up close, Foggy can tell that they - or at least the one closest to him - are a warm, forest-y color, that color that\u2019s not quite brown but not quite green.</p>\n<p>Foggy wets his lips. Hazel, right, that\u2019s what it\u2019s called. Hazel. \u201cYeah, but I should warn you: if we walk into a line dance, I <i>will</i> do-si-do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt grins, and his fingers curl tighter against Foggy\u2019s arm. Foggy can see the smile lines arcing towards his cheekbones. \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, Foggy thinks. This is okay.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The world is spinning. The world is spinning, but that\u2019s okay, because Foggy\u2019s safe on his bed, and Matt is snickering over on the next bed about a joke Foggy\u2019s already forgotten, and the Heights Cafe\u2019s three dollar happy hour margaritas are Foggy\u2019s <i>friends</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh. Which...which was the girl who kept trying to sit in your lap?\u201d Matt asks.</p>\n<p>Foggy grins at the ceiling. \u201cThe redhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, you realize that doesn\u2019t help me at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy frowns, then gets it and stifles a laugh. \u201cRight, sorry. The, uh...she kept saying we should go downtown. Not anywhere in particular, just, like. <i>Downtown</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, yeah. What\u2019s downtown?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, man.\u201d Foggy closes his eyes. \u201cShe was hot, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. Red hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt falls silent, and Foggy wiggles a little, burrowing into his mattress. Better to have a secure nest when it\u2019s spinning like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat color is <i>your</i> hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy opens his eyes. He never thought about it, but yeah, how would Matt know? \u201cIt\u2019s green.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFoggy\u2026\u201d There\u2019s laughter in Matt\u2019s voice, but a bit of an edge, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlond,\u201d Foggy admits. \u201cIt\u2019s blond.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s quiet for a minute. \u201cI guess it\u2019s weird, right? That we\u2019ve been roommates all year and I don\u2019t even know what you look like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo weirder than you quoting Thurgood Marshall all the time. <i>Nerd</i>,\u201d Foggy says, and is rewarded with a laugh. \u201c...I. I could tell you what I look like.\u201d He\u2019s gonna describe Justin Timberlake. No, Orlando Bloom. Maybe some kind of hybrid. Orlustin Bloomberlake.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Matt says. \u201cOr\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cOr?\u201d Foggy prompts. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could...touch you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bed spins faster. \u201c...What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, your face. To...feel your features. It helps,\u201d Matt says. \u201cIt gives me a general idea, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s pretty sure his face doesn\u2019t feel like Orlando Bloom\u2019s. Still\u2026 \u201cOkay,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He hears the creak of Matt\u2019s ancient university-issued mattress as he gets up, and then Matt\u2019s feeling for the edge of Foggy\u2019s bed, poking Foggy in the side by accident in the process. Foggy yelps and squirms away. \u201cOkay, more gentle than that on the face, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always gentle,\u201d Matt says, sitting down next to him, and it\u2019s definitely only Foggy\u2019s stupid runaway brain making that sound as suggestive as it did.</p>\n<p>Matt leans over him, close enough that his thigh presses into Foggy\u2019s hip. His glasses are off and his gaze is directed somewhere to the left of Foggy\u2019s mouth, his eyes heavy-lidded. He looks a little flushed, but that\u2019s probably the dim light in the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Where are you?\u201d he asks. His right hand hovers six inches over Foggy\u2019s sternum.</p>\n<p>Foggy swallows. \u201cUh. Here,\u201d he says. He wraps his fingers around Matt\u2019s wrist and guides Matt\u2019s hand to his face. Even though he\u2019s in control, he can\u2019t help jumping a little when Matt\u2019s fingers make contact with his cheekbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Matt says softly, and brings his other hand up on the other side of Foggy\u2019s face. Foggy closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s methodical about everything, so it\u2019s no surprise when he works his way down over Foggy\u2019s features like he\u2019s gonna be tested on them later. He smooths his fingers over Foggy\u2019s forehead, brushing his hair out of the way as he goes. The pads of his fingers are warm and callused, maybe from all the pounding on a punching bag he thinks Foggy doesn\u2019t know about.</p>\n<p>His fingers skate down from Foggy\u2019s temples over his eyebrows, feather-light across his eyelids, and Foggy can\u2019t help his hitch of breath at the intimacy of it. It\u2019s stupid, they\u2019re just <i>eyelids</i>, but he can\u2019t remember anyone else ever touching them. He can\u2019t imagine anyone else he\u2019d <i>let</i> touch them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat color are your eyes?\u201d Matt asks, and his voice is so close, so soft, that Foggy shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, green?\u201d he says. \u201cOr, like a green-blue, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s right thumb brushes through Foggy\u2019s eyelashes, and Foggy hisses a breath in through his teeth.</p>\n<p>His heartbeat is pounding behind his eyes, wracking his chest, and he knows he\u2019s gotta be flushed, maybe even warm enough for Matt to feel it. Matt\u2019s fingers trace the shape of his nose; Foggy twitches it to make Matt laugh, to dispel the too-intense charge between them, but Matt\u2019s laughter, when it comes, is a rumble through Foggy\u2019s bones that just makes everything worse.</p>\n<p>Then his fingers are on Foggy\u2019s cheeks, his palms cupping them, warm and rough. He outlines Foggy\u2019s jawbones, his chin, the dip above it...and then he pauses. He\u2019s not gonna touch Foggy\u2019s mouth, Foggy realizes, and there\u2019s a spark of relief that\u2019s quickly doused in a wave of disappointment.</p>\n<p>He <i>wants</i> Matt\u2019s hands on his mouth. He wants Matt\u2019s hands <i>everywhere</i>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s enough of a reason to stop this. He opens his mouth to ask if Matt has a sense of what he looks like now, but the only word he gets out is \u201cDid,\u201d because the pad of Matt\u2019s thumb is pressing into his lower lip.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s <i>thumb</i> is on his <i>lip</i>, and Foggy freezes, mouth still slightly open, as that same thumb strokes into the corner, pushes a little like he wants to make Foggy smile. He traces the upper lip with the same thumb, presses into Foggy\u2019s mouth until he hits the ridge of Foggy\u2019s bottom teeth. And stops.</p>\n<p>Foggy opens his eyes.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s closer than he thought, hair falling onto his forehead as he leans over Foggy. His thigh is hot against Foggy\u2019s hip. His eyes aren\u2019t sleepy anymore; they\u2019re very wide, tracking something Foggy can\u2019t see, and color burns high in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Matt licks his lips. \u201cFoggy,\u201d he says, and then \u201cFoggy\u201d again, and in that moment Foggy knows Matt\u2019s going to kiss him, knows it as surely as he knows his own name.</p>\n<p>His heart drums faster, frantically.</p>\n<p>And suddenly there\u2019s a line between Matt\u2019s brows and he\u2019s sitting up, the mattress dipping as he moves away. Foggy\u2019s lip is cold where Matt\u2019s thumb rested. \u201cThanks,\u201d Matt says, his voice distant. \u201cI, uh...that gives me a better mental image. So, yeah...thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets up and scurries awkwardly across the room, back to his own bed. Foggy\u2019s world starts to spin again without Matt to anchor it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says into the crushing silence descending between them. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is never another time.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt yanks the earbud out of his ear and slams his laptop shut, probably a bit harder than is good for it. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to find anything on Fisk. He\u2019s covered his tracks too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Foggy assures him. It feels like that\u2019s all any of them have been doing for the past few weeks: taking turns giving up hope. Reassuring each other. Worrying. \u201cWe just have to keep trying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Matt\u2019s got his glasses off, and even as dark as their office is - they have <i>got</i> to work out their overhead lighting situation - it\u2019s easy to see the naked frustration on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about <i>trying</i>. We have to nail him the first time. He\u2019s already gone after Karen twice over Union Allied. What if he tries again once he finds out what we\u2019re doing? What if he comes after <i>you?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you think I keep a baseball bat in the office?\u201d Foggy jokes, but Matt\u2019s weary expression doesn\u2019t so much as flicker. Foggy sighs and gently kicks Matt\u2019s ankle under the table. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s pack it in for the day. It\u2019s late, Karen went home hours ago. You\u2019re just tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s truer than he wants to admit. Matt seems tired all the time now, and preoccupied, like there\u2019s something he\u2019s not talking about. There\u2019s a gulf between them Foggy doesn\u2019t know how to cross. Part of him wonders if it has something to do with Karen, even if Foggy\u2019s not entirely sure where he and Karen stand after their one and only date <i>literally</i> went up in flames. Matt got kind of weird about Marci, too, which is frankly rich from a guy who goes through women like he\u2019s a cruise ship passenger and they\u2019re a midnight buffet.</p>\n<p>But feeling left out wouldn\u2019t explain all the bruises. Matt\u2019s never been clumsy before, but now it\u2019s like every other day he\u2019s got a split lip or he\u2019s walking like an old man. Foggy doesn\u2019t know how to ask about it, not with Matt so distant lately, but he worries that whatever\u2019s keeping Matt up nights is making him careless. He knows Matt\u2019s perfectly capable of getting around on his own, but a careless blind man in <i>this</i> city, and with all the stairs in his apartment\u2026 Foggy\u2019s throat locks up and he can\u2019t finish the thought.</p>\n<p>He closes his own computer, shoves the papers he was poring over back into their folder, and stands up, heading past Matt and towards the door. Matt doesn\u2019t move; he just sits there, his jaw working minutely, practically thrumming with anxiety; a too-tight guitar string about to snap.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Foggy says again, coming up behind Matt\u2019s chair. He puts a hand on Matt\u2019s shoulder to make sure Matt knows he\u2019s there. \u201cTake a break, Matty. It\u2019ll still be here in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s shoulder trembles finely beneath his fingers; then he turns his head and pushes back against Foggy, temple pressed to Foggy\u2019s sternum.</p>\n<p>Startled as he is, it\u2019s just instinct for Foggy to move his hand to Matt\u2019s head, to press closer because that\u2019s what Matt seems to need. He smooths his hand over Matt\u2019s hair and lets Matt breathe, hot and fast against his stomach. A siren wails in the distance, bleeding into the sounds of the city as it gets further away.</p>\n<p>After a minute, Matt pulls back. He doesn\u2019t look at Foggy - well, he never really <i>looks</i> at Foggy, but he doesn\u2019t even turn his head in Foggy\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says, his voice very steady. \u201cIt\u2019ll be here in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>So this is something else they aren\u2019t going to talk about - which is just as well, because Foggy has no idea what to say. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d he says, giving Matt a brisk clap on the shoulder as he steps back. \u201cThere\u2019s some cold lo mein in my fridge calling my name. Except it\u2019s calling me \u2018Franklin,\u2019 which I really hate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt chuffs something like a laugh as he stands up. It\u2019s a hollow sound, and it makes Foggy\u2019s heart ache. \u201cSounds like you need to show it who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the lo mein,\u201d Foggy admits. \u201cYou know how weak I am for roast pork.\u201d He hands Matt his cane, reaching out to guide Matt\u2019s hand to the handle. \u201cHey. Between that and the egg rolls there\u2019s probably enough for two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s fingers hit Foggy\u2019s knuckles, slide up, and curve around the rubber grip of the cane. \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d He takes his glasses out of his breast pocket and slides them on. \u201cFoggy...thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy shrugs into his jacket, glad Matt can\u2019t see the expression on his face. He doesn\u2019t need to know how worried Foggy is - or how touched. \u201cHey, the Nelson refrigerator is always open, you know that,\u201d he says. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the brains of this outfit. If I don\u2019t help you keep body and soul together, there goes Nelson and Murdock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt gives him a faint smile. Foggy hates how forced it is. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that, can we?\u201d</p>\n<p>He taps his way towards the office door and Foggy follows along behind, turning off the lamps as he goes, and thinking, no. No, they certainly can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s making a noise like an animal left at the pound, and Foggy\u2019s finding it harder and harder not to give a shit.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just the two of them, and has been for hours, ever since Claire packed up her first aid kit and her unimpressed facial expressions and left. Matt\u2019s still out like a light; the floor\u2019s still scattered with bloody gauze and scraps of costume. The Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s costume.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s costume.</p>\n<p>Foggy can\u2019t get his head around it: the insanity of it, of his <i>best friend</i> being a vigilante, a criminal, a, a...he doesn\u2019t know what. He would have sworn he knew Matt Murdock better than anyone on the planet, but Christ - he doesn\u2019t know fucking <i>anything</i>. Least of all how many lies Matt\u2019s told, and for how long, and why.</p>\n<p>Maybe Foggy was always just part of the act; a convenient way to make Matt seem like an everyday, non-vigilante, mostly-sane, mega-handsome tragically heroic blind lawyer. Maybe Foggy never meant a damn thing to Matt.</p>\n<p>In which case he should walk out the door right now. Hell, he should probably walk out the door regardless, because no matter what Matt says when he wakes up, there\u2019s no way around the fact that he\u2019s been lying to Foggy about everything.</p>\n<p><i>If</i> Matt wakes up.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why Foggy can\u2019t leave.</p>\n<p>No, he\u2019s just been sitting here stewing in his own thoughts, because if Matt dies it\u2019ll be his own stupid fault, and how <i>dare</i> he do that to Foggy?</p>\n<p>But now Matt\u2019s keening, soft pained sounds that Foggy doesn\u2019t want to admit are cutting straight through him. He\u2019s not sure if Matt\u2019s dreaming or if that\u2019s just what happens when you get gutted like a fish. In the glow of the billboard outside Matt\u2019s window, he can see Matt\u2019s face, twisted up in pain; he can see Matt curling in on himself. Even in this light it\u2019s easy to tell how pale he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>It serves him right. Probably.</p>\n<p>Foggy turns resolutely towards the window.</p>\n<p>Then he gets up and walks over to the couch. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, and puts his hand on Matt\u2019s forehead, pushing his hair back. Matt\u2019s skin is cooler than he expects. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt stills immediately, so fast Foggy\u2019s breath catches. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the command or the contact or his voice that does it. He\u2019s not sure he <i>wants</i> to know.</p>\n<p>He catches his thumb stroking Matt\u2019s forehead, trying to smooth out the lines there, and steps back. Matt stays quiet, and for that small mercy, Foggy is grateful.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s gonna be a long night.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Matt showers and changes back into street clothes while Foggy drifts aimlessly around the gym, studying the name \u201cMurdock\u201d on faded posters and thinking about a little boy left alone in the dark. They head for the precinct once Matt\u2019s dressed, and they\u2019ve already gone two and a half blocks before either of them realize that Matt\u2019s hand is on Foggy\u2019s arm, just like old times.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Foggy who catches himself first. He doesn\u2019t pull away, but Matt must <i>smell</i> it on him or something, because he falters and stops.</p>\n<p>And maybe Foggy\u2019s not as good at reading people\u2019s secret physical signals as Matt is, but he can definitely feel Matt\u2019s fingers tighten on his arm before letting go.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think...it was just habit. You don\u2019t...you don\u2019t actually need that, do you?\u201d Or the translating of other people\u2019s silent gestures, or the endless descriptions of the world around them, or the hundred and one times Foggy\u2019s put Matt in a cab to make sure he got home safe. He\u2019s still not entirely sure what Matt can \u201csee\u201d and what he can\u2019t, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Matt never needed him at all.</p>\n<p>He can see Matt swallow. \u201cNo,\u201d he admits. His voice is very low.</p>\n<p>For a minute Foggy feels guilty for having assumed, and then he remembers that Matt <i>asked</i>, all those years ago. \u201cWhy...I mean, back in college, why did you ask me to\u2026?\u201d He thinks he should be angry, unpacking another box in the attic of their friendship and finding yet more lies, but he mostly just feels tired. He\u2019s been angry so long.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s hands twist around the handle of his cane. \u201cI.\u201d His voice breaks off and he licks his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess...it was part of the act. Part of making everyone think that I...that I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He shakes his head, the picture of abject misery. \u201cI used you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy cocks his head. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t the De-- \u201d Whoops, they\u2019re in public. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have your, uh, <i>night job</i> then.\u201d Good, now any passersby will just think Matt\u2019s a secret hooker. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t...until after we left L and Z and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt doesn\u2019t actually <i>move</i>, but he somehow manages to shrink in on himself further. \u201cI guess it was like you said. I guess I just always...I always knew I\u2019d wind up...you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lying.</p>\n<p>Foggy can\u2019t hear Matt\u2019s heartbeat. He can\u2019t tell if Matt\u2019s warmer than usual. He can\u2019t even see Matt\u2019s <i>eyes</i>, hidden behind his glasses.</p>\n<p>But Matt\u2019s <i>definitely</i> lying.</p>\n<p>Maybe he always knew he\u2019d end up a fighter. Maybe he was marked that way from birth. But that\u2019s not the reason he asked Foggy to guide him, or at least not the only one.</p>\n<p>Maybe he needs Foggy more than Foggy thinks.</p>\n<p>Matt flinches <i>hard</i> when Foggy\u2019s fingers circle his wrist, and it makes Foggy\u2019s throat catch. But he just tucks Matt\u2019s hand back where it belongs, inside his elbow, warm and strong.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s mouth moves soundlessly for a minute. \u201cWhy\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the act. Like you said,\u201d Foggy says, trying to keep his tone breezy. \u201cPeople would notice if we changed it up. Karen\u2019s already suspicious.\u201d He shrugs and doesn\u2019t bother to translate. \u201cBesides, if I don\u2019t hang on to you, you\u2019ll probably go backflipping down the street to beat up a jaywalker or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s fingers tighten again, digging in so hard Foggy\u2019s gonna have to check for a bruise later. Then he apparently catches himself and his fingers soften. His mouth softens. If relief has a smell, Matt\u2019s stewing in it for sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s just part of the act.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lying again, but Foggy can\u2019t bring himself to be mad about this one.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n<i>Thump!</i>\n</p>\n<p>Foggy drops his toothbrush in the sink with a clatter. Okay, that <i>definitely</i> came from the living room. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a garden variety burglar or if someone figured out that the Nelson and Murdock firm is connected to Daredevil and he\u2019s about to get all his toenails pulled off, but either way, loud thumps after midnight aren\u2019t a good sign.</p>\n<p>He looks around for a weapon, but the closest thing he can find is the toilet brush. Well, maybe he can <i>gross</i> the intruder into submission. Wishing he had his phone with him, he creeps out of the bathroom and peers around the corner.</p>\n<p>Daredevil is crouched on his floor, soaking wet, huddled over like something hurts and fumbling at his mask.</p>\n<p>Foggy drops the toilet brush and hurries forward. \u201cMatt!\u201d Oh God, he\u2019s hurt, he\u2019s hurt and maybe he\u2019s bleeding out and Foggy has some extra-large Band-Aids but that\u2019s about it, what is he going to do if Claire can\u2019t get here in time...?</p>\n<p>\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt says as Foggy drops to his knees in front of him, heedless of the puddle soaking into his pajama pants, \u201cFoggy. Fog, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His fingers slip on the mask, gloved fingers clumsy, and it\u2019s Foggy who draws it off and tosses it aside. There\u2019s a bruise purpling under Matt\u2019s left eye and his lip is split, but that seems to be the worst of it. Foggy puts his hands on Matt\u2019s shoulders to hold him at arms\u2019 length, but the costume is intact, with no indication of the gaping wounds Foggy feared. Bless you, Melvin.</p>\n<p>But Matt is <i>shaking</i>, his breath coming fast, and his eyes are wild. He might not be physically hurt, but something happened. Something bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cMatt,\u201d Foggy says. He puts a hand on Matt\u2019s cheek, and shit, Matt\u2019s ice cold. \u201cMatty. Buddy. What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI. It. The new heroin ring, the one that replaced Gao, it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Foggy knows; Matt\u2019s been trying to get a lead on them for weeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI found...by the river. They were waiting...there was a tank under the warehouse and I didn\u2019t...they held me under\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They tried to <i>drown</i> him. Rage howls suddenly in Foggy\u2019s chest and for the first time he understands why someone might take to the streets to burn that kind of anger out. They tried to drown Matt, <i>his</i> Matt.</p>\n<p>But Matt\u2019s been nearly killed before and it\u2019s never shaken him this badly. Foggy <i>wishes</i>, sort of, that it would, because maybe he\u2019d be more careful...but no, this is different.</p>\n<p>His hands are back on Matt\u2019s shoulders. He can feel him trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, soft and firm. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt shakes his head, a little too hard, a little manic. \u201cThey kept...kept pulling me out and putting me under again, and I couldn\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d His hands scrabble at Foggy\u2019s chest, helpless. \u201cFoggy, I couldn\u2019t <i>see</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a minute Foggy doesn\u2019t understand - and then he does. Matt uses hearing and smell to navigate the world, mostly. Underwater, smell\u2019s gone and hearing\u2019s deadened, if not worse than useless. He knows Matt can swim, he\u2019s <i>been</i> swimming with Matt, but that\u2019s not having his head forced under and out again, over and over; water filling his ears and nostrils and throat; panic and disorientation making the world go sideways and never knowing if he\u2019d have the chance to right it again.</p>\n<p>It must have been like being blinded all over again. Christ, no <i>wonder</i> Matt\u2019s shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d he says again, even if it\u2019s not really true, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cYou got away. You\u2019re here with me. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt shakes like a fucking <i>leaf</i> and Foggy hauls him in close, not caring if he gets soaked in whatever filthy water\u2019s still dripping off of Matt. Matt grabs him and <i>clings</i>, but the minute Foggy feels Matt\u2019s frigid cheek against his own he knows this isn\u2019t going to work. He can\u2019t calm down if he\u2019s too busy developing hypothermia.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, buddy,\u201d he murmurs against that same cheek and stands up, pulling Matt with him. \u201cWe gotta dry you off, you\u2019re going to catch the augue in a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt doesn\u2019t laugh, but he also doesn\u2019t resist as Foggy tows him down the hall and into the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be fresh, but you need to get out of those wet clothes,\u201d Foggy says.</p>\n<p>Matt stares helplessly somewhere in his direction until Foggy starts tugging at his belt, trying to figure out how the whole damn thing fastens together. \u201cOh,\u201d he says softly, and lets Foggy pull his gloves off; helps Foggy undo the fastenings so that the shirt will pull over his head; sits on the covered toilet to let Foggy tug his boots off like a kindergartener who needs help with his galoshes.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s standing mostly-naked in Foggy\u2019s bathroom and it\u2019s not how Foggy thought that would happen when he forgets not to let himself imagine that\u2019s a possibility, but Matt is goosepimpled and lost and there\u2019s nothing the least bit sexual about it. Foggy grabs a towel, grateful that he\u2019s a sucker for the big, expensive, fluffy ones. He wraps it around Matt and <i>rubs</i>, like he\u2019s starting a fire, like he can rekindle the spark in Matt\u2019s smile through sheer friction.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still with me, buddy?\u201d he asks, slipping a hand under the towel to touch Matt\u2019s arm. He\u2019s warmer than he was, but he\u2019s hunched and trembling, a fox cornered by hunters and smelling blood.</p>\n<p>Matt shakes his head like there\u2019s still water in his ears, like it\u2019s all he can hear. \u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t <i>hear</i>,\u201d he says, and the <i>ache</i> in his voice makes Foggy clutch Matt\u2019s hand and press it to his heart. He uses his other hand, his grip on the towel still wrapped around Matt\u2019s shoulders, to pull him in close, and Matt leans in until his forehead presses against Foggy\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything outside, in the building, it doesn\u2019t matter. Can you hear my heart?\u201d Matt nods jerkily, wet hair brushing Foggy\u2019s face. \u201cGood. Listen to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stand there, breathing in and out, Matt taking three or four hiccupy breaths to each of Foggy\u2019s. But Foggy waits, his thumb stroking Matt\u2019s knuckles - bruised and raw, always raw - until Matt\u2019s breathing starts to even out: only three to each of Foggy\u2019s, then two, then one. Until the shaking\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Foggy starts to pull back. Matt\u2019s fingers tighten in his shirt, and he waits for Matt to let go on his own before stepping away. \u201cLet me get you some clothes,\u201d he says, and heads into the bedroom to dig up a T-shirt and a spare pair of sweatpants. They\u2019ll be too big on Matt but that\u2019s okay; it\u2019s not like he\u2019s heading to court in them or anything.</p>\n<p>When he holds out the sweats and a faded Columbia Lions shirt, Matt just stares vaguely in the right direction. Foggy\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because his senses are still on the fritz or if he\u2019s just that out of his head. He gives the clothes a little shake in case that helps. \u201cCome on, get dressed, you nudist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt half turns towards the costume crumpled in a sodden mess on the bathroom floor. \u201cI can...I should...I don\u2019t want to bother\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMatthew Michael Murdock, I swear to God, if you don\u2019t put these sweatpants on and go lie down, I will\u2026\u201d Okay, Matt is actually way stronger than Foggy, which limits Foggy\u2019s already narrow threatening options. \u201c...I will flick you on the nose <i>so hard</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get the laugh he wanted, but Matt takes the sweatpants, which he chalks up as a victory. Once Matt is swimming in his clothes he tries to head for the living room, but Foggy puts his hands on Matt\u2019s shoulders and steers him towards the bedroom. \u201cNuh-uh. I think you need a real bed tonight, buddy. I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>That</i> gets him Matt stopping short and turning on him a look of such desperation that it\u2019s all Foggy can do not to haul on his shoes, go find the gang that did this to Matt, and do his level best to beat the stuffing out of them.</p>\n<p>Instead, he forces a smile. \u201cYou know what? I think the bed\u2019s big enough for two.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably weird that that\u2019s what makes Matt stop dragging his heels and actually get into bed, but Foggy\u2019s so relieved that Matt might actually rest that he doesn\u2019t care. Matt curls up to face the wall, and Foggy shuts the light and climbs in behind him. When he puts his hand between Matt\u2019s shoulder blades he can feel Matt jump; he can feel the tension singing down the bumps of his spine.</p>\n<p>He pulls his hand back, unsure. \u201cNo,\u201d Matt says immediately. His voice is hoarse. He might have been screaming before.</p>\n<p>Foggy stops caring if it\u2019s weird, and he stops caring about the tiny, stupid part of his heart that sometimes hopes for the impossible. He scoots forward, curling up against Matt, draping himself around him like the armor he wishes he could be. Matt\u2019s fingers tangle with his.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d he asks, his voice muffled against the back of Matt\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Matt says, \u201cit\u2019s...yeah,\u201d and falls silent.</p>\n<p>Foggy lets his eyes close. He can\u2019t hear as much as Matt can, of course, can\u2019t use his senses the same way, but he can feel Matt\u2019s ribcage expanding and contracting against him, he can hear the distant hum of cars along the asphalt below, and it\u2019s enough of a lullabye.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s half-asleep when Matt says, \u201cDid you <i>full name me</i> back there?\u201d and the laughter in his voice chases the worry from Foggy\u2019s heart like rain washing the city streets clean.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cTo another glorious victory by Nelson and Murdock!\u201d Karen crows, holding up the liquor bottle like a conquering pirate.</p>\n<p>Foggy cheers obediently. Matt, ever the pedant, tries to clarify through his laughter. \u201cTechnically, we settled out of court.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the client\u2019s favor,\u201d Karen points out, pouring a finger of whatever unnameable brew Josie\u2019s trying to pass off as scotch into Matt\u2019s glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we got <i>paid</i>,\u201d Foggy adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust celebrate, Matt,\u201d Karen says, nudging him. Foggy does likewise from the other side. It\u2019s crowded tonight, and they\u2019re more crammed than usual. Matt\u2019s trapped between them, so it\u2019s easy to nudge.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Matt says, lifting his glass. His thigh is pressed to Foggy\u2019s; his free hand is on the table next to Foggy\u2019s, the tip of his pinky resting on the back of Foggy\u2019s hand. Foggy knows Matt\u2019s too good with spatial awareness for any of that to be an accident, but Matt looks happier than he has in <i>months</i>. Foggy\u2019s not going to risk that changing. \u201cTo Nelson and Murdock. And Page,\u201d Matt adds quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! What would we do without Page?\u201d Foggy asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe bankrupt, probably,\u201d Karen says with a sunny smile, and they clink glasses. Matt leans into Foggy as they drink, and Foggy\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s the liquor or Matt warming him down to his toes. Either way, for the first time in a very long time, it finally feels like things are going right.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s getting really tired of being nearly killed in explosions. Which is not a thing he ever expected to have the opportunity to get tired of, but life\u2019s full of surprises.</p>\n<p>He can thank his lucky stars for two things: one, that Matt and Karen are already gone for the night when it happens, and two, that a craving for a greasy egg sandwich from the bodega downstairs hits him about two minutes before the timer on the bomb goes off. He\u2019s already out of the office proper and halfway down the first flight of stairs when the explosion comes, which is the only thing that saves him. He still takes a hard fall down to the landing, but bruised shins and a sprained wrist are a small price to pay for his life.</p>\n<p>Keeping his head down to avoid the black smoke billowing out of the wreckage of Nelson &amp; Murdock\u2019s door, he searches the other offices for other late workers - and a working phone to call 911, because he landed on his back pocket in his tumble down the stairs, and his own phone is useless.</p>\n<p>By the time he\u2019s helping a dazed and coughing Mrs. Cardinelli out of her office, though, he can already hear the sirens. When he reaches the street, the paramedics slap an oxygen mask on him and start wrapping his wrist before he can say, \u201cNo, I need to keep checking the building,\u201d or \u201cWait, I have to call my partner.\u201d Matt\u2019s gonna hear. Matt\u2019s gonna <i>panic</i>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not actually as bad as he thought when he was in it, and the firefighters get the flames down from \u201cterrifying\u201d to \u201ctime for s\u2019mores!\u201d level pretty quickly. Between gasps of oxygen he tells the detectives on the scene about the mob case they\u2019re involved in, which he\u2019s pretty sure is the source of tonight\u2019s surprise gift. Either that or someone\u2019s connected Matt to Daredevil, and he\u2019s certainly not about to tell the police <i>that</i>.</p>\n<p>The paramedics want to take Foggy to the hospital, but he doesn\u2019t have time. He needs to get to Karen\u2019s. Matt\u2019s probably Daredeviling around somewhere, but Karen\u2019s home, and maybe watching the news - hell, she might even be able to see the flames from her window. Foggy can walk to her place from here, he can call Matt\u2019s burner from her apartment, he can tell Brett to be on notice, he can do <i>something</i> besides feeling helpless and scared.</p>\n<p>He shakes off the oxygen mask, the well-meaning and probably correct advice of the paramedics, and heads for Karen. She\u2019s not far - Hell\u2019s Kitchen isn\u2019t actually that big - but he still takes every shortcut he knows. He\u2019s booking it through an alley when a figure in red drops down in front of him and nearly scares the piss out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMa--Daredevil!\u201d he gasps, catching himself. \u201cJesus Christ, warn a guy next time!\u201d His heart is hammering in his throat, threatening to choke him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFoggy.\u201d Matt straightens up. His voice is strangled. \u201cI heard...there was a TV through an open window and the news said\u2026\u201d His head tilts; his nostrils flare. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Foggy says.</p>\n<p>Matt shakes his head. \u201cYou smell like blood, you smell like...Foggy, I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>okay</i>,\u201d Foggy says again, but Matt\u2019s already tugging off his gloves, dropping them on the alley floor, and then Foggy\u2019s back is against the rough brick wall behind him, and Matt\u2019s hands are on his face.</p>\n<p>He lets Matt do it, lets those shaking fingers check over every inch of him like Matt can\u2019t quite believe he\u2019s there unless he can sculpt Foggy back into being himself. He lets Matt do it because he hasn\u2019t been friends with him this long not to understand that this is what Matt needs, and because maybe he can admit that he needs it too. He just escaped fiery death, after all; it\u2019s normal to want a little human comfort when there\u2019s still smoke rattling through your lungs.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s fingers press into his cheeks, his lips. \u201cYou smell like soot,\u201d he says, his voice barely audible. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with your breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathed in some smoke. They gave me oxygen,\u201d Foggy says, and now he can hear it too, the rasp in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019ll clear out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s hands are still moving, across Foggy\u2019s shoulders now, his banged elbow, his wrenched hip. Maybe he can smell bruising under the skin, or feel the heat of it, because he manages to ferret out every wound, every tiny hurt, and Foggy hisses through his teeth and lets him.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s fingers skate across the ace bandage on Foggy\u2019s wrist. \u201cThe blood\u2026\u201d he says. Foggy wishes he could see more of Matt\u2019s face than his tense and worried mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI skinned my knees. Like a kid on a bike,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>, Matt, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s hand goes to Foggy\u2019s mouth as he talks - not to silence him, Foggy\u2019s pretty sure, just to feel the words as they come out. He\u2019s still trembling, every inch of him that Foggy can feel, a raw nerve, and Foggy tries to reassure him again but he can\u2019t because Matt is kissing him.</p>\n<p>Matt is <i>kissing him</i>, bearing him into the wall so hard it scrapes the back of Foggy\u2019s head. His hands are tight enough to hurt and his mouth burns hotter than the fire and Foggy never wants this moment to end.</p>\n<p>It does, of course, but only in the sense that Matt breaks the kiss to drag his mouth over Foggy\u2019s cheekbone, his jaw, presses burning kisses all over his face, and Foggy\u2019s certainly not going to complain about this change in the agenda. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Matt says between kisses, his hands fisting Foggy\u2019s shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t...I can\u2019t...I need you <i>safe</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Foggy teases, because jokes are the only thing he has to hold on to in this strange new world of <i>Matt kissing him</i>. \u201cIf this is my reward for near-death experiences, I might start playing in traffic or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt actually <i>growls</i>. Oh, wow. That\u2019s a sound that\u2019s going to keep Foggy warm at night for a <i>long</i> time to come.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>kidding</i>,\u201d Foggy assures him, even though he kind of wants to see what he can do to make Matt growl again. He cups Matt\u2019s face, the contrast between the slick red leather under his fingers and the stubbled cheeks under his thumbs strange and fascinating. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not afraid of danger.\u201d He hopes Matt can hear his smile. \u201cDaredevil will save me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt <i>groans</i> and presses his face to Foggy\u2019s neck. His breath is hot and damp. There\u2019s a stupid little horn poking Foggy in the jaw but he thinks it\u2019s a fair trade-off.</p>\n<p>He feels it when Matt\u2019s shoulders come down, when he wrests control back. He sucks in a breath against Foggy\u2019s jugular and straightens up. \u201cDaredevil will save you,\u201d he agrees, and his voice sounds steadier too. \u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>Foggy presses his thumb into the corner of Matt\u2019s mouth, because he has to. \u201cI should get to Karen\u2019s,\u201d he says, a little reluctantly. He still wants to make sure she\u2019s okay, that she knows <i>he\u2019s</i> okay, but part of him is afraid that if he stops touching Matt this will all disappear. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna be worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt nods. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get there safe,\u201d he says, pointing to the roofs, and Foggy doesn\u2019t bother to try to deter him.</p>\n<p>Matt pulls his gloves on. He doesn\u2019t kiss Foggy again, but he rests his hand over Foggy\u2019s heart for a minute like he\u2019s making sure it\u2019s still there, and that\u2019s almost as good.</p>\n<p>Then - and Foggy\u2019s not quite sure how he does it - he leaps onto a trash can and ricochets up a wall impossibly fast, until he disappears over the roof. \u201cShow-off,\u201d Foggy mutters, and he hears laughter from above.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what just happened. He\u2019s even less sure what\u2019s going to happen next. But he knows his own personal guardian angel in red keeps his own kind of watch until Foggy\u2019s at Karen\u2019s door, and that\u2019s a comfort of its own.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Very late that night he takes a long, <i>long</i> shower, until the sweat and soot that even his average nose can smell is washed away. He wishes he could send the aches and pains and all the purpling little bruises swirling down the drain with them, but the hot water helps, and more importantly, he\u2019s <i>alive</i>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on his bed in his underwear, trying to figure out how to rewrap his wrist properly, when he realizes someone\u2019s at his window. He lets out a sort of muffled yelp that at least isn\u2019t a full scream before his brain catches up and reminds him that, oh yeah, he\u2019s got a friend who likes to hop around on rooftops in fetish-wear. At least, it\u2019s unlikely to be anyone else, six stories up.</p>\n<p>He goes to the window and sure enough, it\u2019s Daredevil somehow clinging to the ledge and looking totally comfortable doing so. \u201cYou know, I have a front door,\u201d Foggy says as he opens the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, because me ringing your doorbell wearing this would have looked so much more normal,\u201d Matt says. His voice sounds regular, calm, and suddenly Foggy remembers that he\u2019s practically naked. It shouldn\u2019t make any difference - they used to live together, for one, and for another, Matt\u2019s <i>blind</i> so it probably doesn\u2019t matter to him whether he can smell a shirt on Foggy or not - but Foggy still steps away, fumbling with the ace bandage in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your wrist?\u201d Matt asks. He doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s about to pounce on Foggy and kiss him again. Foggy would think he imagined it if he hadn\u2019t spent twenty minutes after his shower staring in the mirror at the traces of beard burn on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, it hurts, but it\u2019s fine. Or will be, if I can figure this stupid bandage out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Matt says, reaching for it.</p>\n<p>Foggy takes another step back and waves him off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>, I\u2019ll figure it out\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I know how to do it, I\u2019ve done it for myself a million times\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, you realize that\u2019s not actually reassuring, right?\u201d Foggy snaps, embarrassment making him sharp, and Matt freezes.</p>\n<p>Foggy closes his eyes. Idiot. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m...sorry. You\u2019re right, you should do it.\u201d He breathes out hard through his nose, exasperated - with Matt, with himself, with this whole stupid <i>thing</i>. \u201cJust...take the mask off first, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears a rustle and opens his eyes to see Matt drag the cowl back. His hair is tousled and matted and he still looks like a wounded puppy, and Foggy remembers the tremble in Matt\u2019s frame when he kissed him earlier and feels even shittier.</p>\n<p>Matt tosses the cowl onto Foggy\u2019s bed, then the gloves, one by one, and that - well. Matt\u2019s clothes slowly scattering themselves across Foggy\u2019s cheap comforter does something unexpected deep in Foggy\u2019s belly, something hot and wanting.</p>\n<p>Then Matt sits on the edge of the bed and holds out his hands and that does something <i>worse</i>. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Foggy sits next to Matt and hands him the bandage. Matt lays Foggy\u2019s wrist across his lap, palm up, and starts winding the bandage around it with sure, practiced fingers. His hands are warm and steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe men who set that bomb...\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re in police custody now.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Matt\u2019s been busy. Foggy raises an eyebrow. \u201cAnd in full body casts?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Daredevil mask is scary as hell in the right lighting, but Matt\u2019s face right now is scarier. \u201cDidn\u2019t have time to do more than subdue them before the police showed up. Lucky for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Foggy says, trying to keep his voice light. \u201cWe just swapped out the folding chairs for real desk chairs, and now we have to buy new ones. Those bastards had to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s jaw is making the little motions that mean he\u2019s struggling with something, fighting to hold something in. Maybe Foggy shouldn\u2019t have joked. \u201cIf you had been hurt, I mean <i>more</i> hurt\u2026\u201d A muscle jumps in his cheek as he fastens the bandage in place with the little metal prongy things it comes with.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Foggy starts to say, but Matt\u2019s not done.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you had been hurt, I think I would have killed them,\u201d he says, and Foggy\u2019s pretty sure the \u201cI think\u201d was only added to make him feel better.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s too much. It makes Foggy want to weep for Matt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, tough shit, Murdock,\u201d he says, too loud, too falsely jovial. Matt actually flinches. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me that easy. We\u2019ve got a lot of student loans to pay off, and you need me around to keep you from taking every case pro bono.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s mouth twitches, but it\u2019s too sad to be a smile. Even though he\u2019s finished with Foggy\u2019s wrist, he\u2019s still holding Foggy\u2019s hand loosely in his lap, the pad of his thumb stroking the metal clasp of the bandage. He\u2019s sitting close enough that his thigh is pressed to Foggy\u2019s, and his exhalations stir the damp hair falling against Foggy\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>Foggy doesn\u2019t know what this is. He\u2019s afraid to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can sniff out a falsely accused millionaire for us,\u201d Matt says. Neither of them manage to fake a laugh.</p>\n<p>Foggy hates this. He <i>hates</i> this. If Matt was just\u2026<i>overwhelmed</i> before, he wishes he would just say so, so they can go back to being very good friends who politely ignore the occasional spikes in Foggy\u2019s temperature when Matt smirks or laughs or wears a really nice suit. And if he meant the kiss - the <i>kisses</i>, plural, so many of them burning against Foggy\u2019s skin - then he wishes Matt would just say that too, so Foggy can decide if he\u2019s more scared at the thought of losing Matt or losing his only chance.</p>\n<p>Either way, Foggy really wishes he was wearing pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt says, and stops. He cocks his head like he\u2019s listening, then shakes it. \u201cCould you just tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, Foggy does <i>not</i> want to do that. \u201cCan\u2019t you, I don\u2019t know, smell it or something?\u201d he says, like the jerk he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know your heart is racing,\u201d Matt says. His fingers linger on Foggy\u2019s pulse point. His voice is miserable. \u201cI know you keep shifting, and your breathing\u2019s uneven, and you smell like adrenalin. I mean, you smell like shampoo and cotton and iron residue from your pipes, but under that it\u2019s all...it\u2019s all copper. I know you\u2019re staring at me right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He is. Foggy <i>knows</i>, sort of, that Matt can do this, but it\u2019s strange and unsettling to have that focus trained on him. Unsettling and, if he\u2019s honest, a little bit thrilling.</p>\n<p>Matt licks his lips. \u201cBut I can only read what\u2019s actually there, I can\u2019t...I don\u2019t know what it <i>means</i>. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re just still scared from the explosion, or from seeing me outside the window, or if you\u2019re mad at me for what I said just now, or what I did when I\u2026when I found you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His fingers tighten on that last part, and Foggy <i>knows</i>. Or at least, he\u2019s pretty sure. \u201cWhat else could it be, Matt?\u201d he asks softly.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s lips part but nothing comes out for a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t want to assume,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck everything up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Foggy says, and can\u2019t fight his growing smile. \u201cThought you were supposed to be fearless.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he kisses Matt, right on his startled mouth.</p>\n<p>He has about two and a half seconds to be triumphant about surprising someone who can smell his emotions practically before Foggy <i>has</i> them - and then Matt\u2019s kissing him back, somewhere between joyful and desperate, and Foggy\u2019s heart might actually beat its way out of his chest. Matt\u2019s hands are everywhere - cupping Foggy\u2019s face, combing through his hair, stroking down his sides and up his thighs, and Foggy stops feeling embarrassed about being mostly naked right now, because Matt\u2019s hands on his bare skin are <i>everything</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt mumbles against Foggy\u2019s mouth, ragged and adoring, \u201cFoggy, Foggy.\u201d It\u2019s the best sound he\u2019s ever made.</p>\n<p>Foggy pulls back to look at Matt; at his kiss-reddened mouth, his hazel eyes, unfocused but still so pretty. He cups Matt\u2019s face with one hand, strokes the smile lines by his eyes and watches Matt\u2019s eyelids droop to half-mast, as blissed out as a purring cat. \u201cGod, Matt\u2026\u201d he breathes. \u201cDid you really not know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt lets his eyes close, raises his eyebrows. \u201c<i>You</i> didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I</i> can\u2019t smell your heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt laughs and the sound bubbles up in Foggy\u2019s chest. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Foggy stretches out, pulling Matt down to the mattress with him. \u201cShow me what you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Matt does is map out their intertwined lives on Foggy\u2019s body with his fingers. What Matt does is kiss every bruise and scrape and strained muscle like a benediction, and let Foggy do the same to him. What Matt does is tell Foggy he loves him, without words, skin to skin, and Foggy thinks between breathless gasps for air that Matt might have a point: he should have known. Matt\u2019s been telling him all along.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s okay, though. Foggy plans on listening more closely from now on.</p>"
