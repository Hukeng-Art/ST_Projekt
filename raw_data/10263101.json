  "text": "<p>Yakov had said not to practice, that he was just here to observe since he would soon <em>finally</em> be able to move up to the junior competitions. But the last thing Yuri wants to do is sit around all day watching <em>other</em> people skate, and if that mean sneaking out his hotel room and into the rink before dawn, so be it.</p>\n<p>This thought is viciously interrupted when he walks straight into someone bigger than he is and crashes to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wow, sorry, I didn\u2019t see you!\u201d a panicked voice says, and Yuri has to blink a few times just to make sure he hadn\u2019t fallen harder than he thought and the person in front of him is actually who he thinks he is. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri keeps staring, mouth parted in surprise but no words coming out. He\u2019d known the man was here, of course, and he\u2019d been looking forward to seeing him, but not \u2013 not like this. Here, alone, after knocking into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hit your head did you?\u201d he kneels in front of him, reaching out to gently feel for any bumps, eye wide and concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuri croaks out finally, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Yuuri Katsuki asks, and in the poster Yuri has hanging above his bed the man\u2019s eyes look black, but this close he can see that they\u2019re actually a soft shade of brown. Yuri nods, not trusting his voice, and he\u2019s screaming inside to <em>pull it together</em>, but he\u2019s still just sitting on the ground. Katsuki smiles, \u201cGood. Sorry, that was my fault, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I thought I was the only one crazy enough to be practicing this early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d and oh god if Yakov or Viktor could see him now they would make fun of him forever, or even worse Mila. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be practicing, I\u2019m not competing. My coach just brought me to observe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you get antsy if you don\u2019t skate,\u201d Katsuki says knowingly and for some reason he seems content to continue hanging out with him on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m the same way. Sometimes when I get nervous and can\u2019t skate, I dance. In the middle of the living room at two in the morning,\u201d he flashes a smile that makes Yuri want to die, \u201cHe\u2019s really nice about it, but it drives my roommate crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yuri says, and Katsuki skates to calm himself too, to focus. Mila always called him weird and Yakov lectured him, but sometimes it wasn\u2019t about practicing, it was just needing to move.</p>\n<p>Katsuki goes crosslegged, clearly in no hurry to go anywhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d he cuts him off, then blushes, then hates himself for both those things. Katsuki looks surprised, and Yuri can\u2019t think as to <em>why</em>. He\u2019s a nationally ranked figure skater. He\u2019s Yuri\u2019s <em>favorite</em> figure skater. His salchows are mediocre and his other jumps are even worse, although his spins are actually really good. But Yuri isn\u2019t impressed by technical finesse, he\u2019s forced to share ice with Victor Nikiforov after all. He\u2019s impressed by Katsuki's step sequences, the way that when he\u2019s skating it looks like the music is playing to his movements and not the other way around. It\u2019s mesmerizing and breath taking and Yuri can never bring himself to look away, even when Katsuki makes a mistake.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, he\u2019d rather stab himself in the eye than see Viktor perform another quadruple flip. Viktor\u2019s good on presentation, obviously, but he\u2019s not on Katsuki\u2019s level. No matter what anyone else seems to think.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Yuri Plisetsky,\u201d he says, trying to fill the silence with something less embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s smile breaks out across his face, \u201cHello Yuri. If you\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay, do you want to get on the ice? We won\u2019t have much time until it starts filling up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri nods, and Katsuki\u2019s so <em>nice</em>, none of the articles had ever said he was nice.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also clearly keeping an eye on Yuri as he skates, making sure he really is okay, and Yuri would normally be pissed off by something like that but he has his favorite skater\u2019s eyes on him. They\u2019re skating on the same ice, and instead he does what he can to <em>keep</em> Katsuki\u2019s eyes on him, performing jumps and spins. At some point Katsuki starts clapping, and for a humiliating moment Yuri thinks he\u2019s making fun of him. But when he looks up the older skater is beaming, \u201cGreat!\u201d he says, and there\u2019s nothing but open delight in his face, \u201cYou\u2019re really good!\u201d</p>\n<p>New skaters aren\u2019t usually happy with him when they see him skate. Especially the older ones. They get quiet, and maybe they\u2019re not quite mean, but they\u2019re also clearly not pleased about his talent. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says, shy in way he hasn\u2019t been since he was a little kid, and blurts, \u201cCan you help me with my spins? You\u2019re really good at them.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s that surprise again, as if Katsuki doesn\u2019t know that about himself. But it fades and he says, \u201cOf course, come here and show me what you did again.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em>amazing</em>, and Katsuki\u2019s actually a good teacher, voice low and patient and oddly reminding him of Yakov. When other skaters start trickling onto they leave the ice, discussing Yuri\u2019s spins and what he should work on and what he has down solid.</p>\n<p>This is another thing he\u2019s not used to and hadn\u2019t expected \u2013 Katsuki isn\u2019t talking to him like he\u2019s a kid, not really. He\u2019s speaking to him like a skater, like he\u2019s smart and knows what he\u2019s doing and doesn\u2019t talk down or make fun of him once.</p>\n<p>They say that meeting your heroes is always a disappointment, but Yuri thinks this is about perfect as it can get.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s proven wrong a moment later when they leave the rink and reach the expected part where they\u2019ll go their separate ways, but instead Katsuki hesitates and asks, \u201cDo you know any place around here to get breakfast? I\u2019ll pay, I did knock you down after all.\u201d Yuri\u2019s stomach rumbles, answering for him, but Katsuki just grins and says, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yakov stares down at his phone in disbelief, shakes it like that will make it make more sense before giving up and handing it to Viktor, \u201cVitya, what does this say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pauses in lacing up his skates and takes the phone. He clears his throat before reciting, \u201cHave not been kidnapped. Getting breakfast with a skater.\u201d He shrugs and hands the phone back, \u201cYura made a friend. So what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnoring the part where Yura <em>blatantly ignored </em>my orders not to practice,\u201d Viktor rolls his eyes because Yakov should have known that that was going to happen from the beginning, \u201cMaking friends doesn\u2019t sound like a very \u2013 him thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s thirteen now,\u201d Viktor says, \u201cmaybe he\u2019s maturing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov snatches his phone out of Viktor\u2019s hands, \u201cWhy would that mean anything? You\u2019re just as much of a brat now as when I started training you,\u201d and stalks off.</p>\n<p>Viktor calls out, \u201cDon\u2019t be like that! Come back! Yakov! My short program is today! YAKOV!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Celestino demands, \u201cYou said you\u2019d be back over an hour ago!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri checks the time on his phone, and also sees the three missed calls, \u201cSorry! I didn\u2019t realize how late it had gotten. I went and got breakfast after I was done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino manages to maintain the angry fa\u00e7ade for another moment, but drops it under Yuri\u2019s sheepish wince. \u201cWell, you do practice insanely early anyway, so I suppose we haven\u2019t lost much time. Go get changed.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri shows up to the rink about fifteen minutes later than he had the day before, and Katsuki is already skating, headphones in so he\u2019s not likely to notice him.</p>\n<p>Yuri quietly goes to the edge of the rink, leaning on the side as he watches Katsuki skate. He\u2019ll get on the ice himself in a moment, but for now he\u2019s content to watch. The familiar beginnings of a routine starts, and he focuses on Katsuki even more intensely. The senior skater had messed up his short program in a half dozen ways the day before, but had still gotten impressive scores anyway thanks to his step sequence.</p>\n<p>But Yuri recognizes this routine, it\u2019s the same routine he did yesterday, only \u2013 different.</p>\n<p>Here, where he thinks he\u2019s alone, where there are no judges and no crowds, he performs it almost flawlessly. His spins seem faster, he lands all his jumps \u2013 but they\u2019re not even the <em>same</em> jumps, he adds rotations and amounts, and ends it with a triple flip. <em>Ends </em>the program with it! Katsuki is known for his stamina, but that\u2019s insane! None of the jumps were perfect, and he\u2019d had to touch down on the last one, but it was still scarily impressive.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly exhausted him, chest heaving, but when Katsuki looks up and sees him he freezes. Yuri bursts into applause, and doesn\u2019t stop even as Katsuki\u2019s whole face goes red and he glides over to him, taking out his headphones. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d Yuri beams, \u201cThat was \u2013 the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen! If you\u2019d skated like that yesterday, you would have beaten all of them!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grimaces.</p>\n<p>Yuri instantly feels the uncomfortable heat of shame bubble up in him and stuffs his hands into his jacket pocket. \u201cI mean \u2013 not that yesterday was bad! I mean, just,\u201d he looks down, and this would be the part where he gets angry and storms away, but he doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to be angry at Katsuki. So he swallows and looks back up, \u201cSorry. I \u2013 sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki gives a half smile, and it looks like it hurts. But he doesn\u2019t seem mad either. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I wish I\u2019d skated like that yesterday too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and the air between them is almost easy and he should leave it, but he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you skate like that before. I\u2019ve seen all your competition footage, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like what you just did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it?\u201d he asks, and there\u2019s that surprise again, so honest and painful to witness that Yuri can\u2019t even bring himself to be embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d he confirms.</p>\n<p>Katsuki half smiles again, but this time it doesn\u2019t look like it hurts him. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 do well, with crowds and, you know, pressure. I wish I did. But even with my coach, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I only skate my best when I\u2019m alone. Which doesn\u2019t do me a lot of good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yuri says, softly, because he\u2019s not stupid, he\u2019s heard of more than one athlete that couldn\u2019t handle the pressure. But it\u2019s not fair, because Katsuki is handling it, mostly, is talented and strong, and before this he was just Yuri\u2019s favorite skater, but now he thinks he might be the <em>best</em> skater. But he doesn\u2019t know how to articulate any of that without seeming like a crazy person, so he asks, \u201cYour triples are pretty good, but do you want to work on your quads? My coach won\u2019t let me perform it in competitions, but I\u2019m pretty good at the quad salchow.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as it\u2019s out of his mouth he regrets it. Katsuki\u2019s a senior skater, and an adult, and as he clearly just demonstrated he doesn\u2019t need help from some <em>kid</em>, quads or no quads. Yuri\u2019s thinking maybe he can just run away and pretend none of this ever happened and that he has any dignity left.</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t laugh at him. Instead he blinks and says, \u201cWow, you can do the quad salchow already? That\u2019s amazing! I\u2019d love your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri\u2019s mouth drops open, heart in his throat, because \u2013 because no one takes him seriously, not Mila or Georgi or Viktor, not even Yakov. He\u2019s good, but he\u2019s a kid, and he has a long way to go. As they all keep reminding him. \u201cCool,\u201d he chokes out, and says, hopeful, \u201cThen \u2013 then we can work on my spins again? If that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds perfect to me,\u201d Katsuki says firmly, \u201ca nice even trade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri retreats to pull on his skates before he can make a total fool of himself, but he\u2019s beaming the whole time.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri meets the Russian junior skater every morning for the rest of the week, and it should be weird but instead it\u2019s easy and \u2013 fun, even. It grounds him, enough that it effects his skating and he lands a couple of jumps that he\u2019d been expecting to mess up. Even Celestino looks impressed. It also means he manages to scrape his way onto the podium.</p>\n<p>Viktor gets first, of course, and Chris winks down at him from his place on second, \u201cDrinks tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he glares. Chris just shrugs, but he\u2019s still smirking.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tells himself that <em>for once</em> he\u2019s going to tell the annoying older skater no, and not make a fool of himself in front of one of his only friends in the skating world, but he knows that\u2019s a lie even as he thinks it. Besides, he\u2019s pretty sure half the reason Chris hangs out with him is for the embarrassing antics he always seems to talk Yuuri into after a few too many drinks.</p>\n<p>Chris shows up at his room, as usual, an hour after they\u2019d managed to pry themselves away from the reporters. Yuuri\u2019s in jeans and a white button up, clothes he\u2019s not attached to just in case he ends up losing them. \u201cViktor\u2019s going to join us,\u201d Chris says once Yuuri has closed the door behind him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares, betrayed. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be unsportsmanlike for us not to invite him!\u201d Chris insists, pouting as he pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose. \u00a0\u201cBesides, we were all on the same podium, there\u2019s no reason for you to be nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>He crosses his arms, \u201cOh, and how are we going to go out for an anonymous night of debauchery with Viktor Nikiforov with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris silently holds up the chunkiest, ugliest pair of glasses he\u2019s ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, this is the worst idea you\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he says faintly.</p>\n<p>Chris claps him on the shoulder and steers him to the elevator, \u201cCome on, we don\u2019t want to leave Viktor waiting!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been friends with Yuuri longer than Viktor, ever since they were junior competitors together, and so he\u2019s not surprised in the slightest when at the first club they go to Yuuri bolts to the bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay that I came?\u201d Viktor asks, eyes concerned under the hideous glasses he\u2019d forced his friend to wear. \u201cI know you said this was something you two do together. I can leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe only do it alone because Yuuri\u2019s anti-social and Sara and Phichit are too young, not that that stops them all the time. He\u2019s just shy, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He looks over and Yuuri is taking shots. At this rate he won\u2019t be shy for long.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Viktor says, frowning.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Two hours and an ungodly amount of alcohol later, Chris and Yuuri are grinding on the dance floor while Viktor watches open mouthed.</p>\n<p>The quiet, reserved Japanese skater had been steadily drinking and mostly ignoring him for the whole night. Then about ten minutes ago Chris had said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had drained the last his drink, slammed his glass onto the table so hard it shook, and said, \u201cYou bet your ass it\u2019s time,\u201d and dragged him onto the dance floor.</p>\n<p>Chris beckons him over, but he\u2019s not sure where exactly in the writhing bodies he\u2019s supposed to fit. Yuuri catches his eye and smiles at him for the first time tonight, cheeks flushed, and <em>oh</em>, okay then, Viktor can feel an answering blush on his own cheeks even though he\u2019s only had a couple of drinks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pulls himself from Chris and holds out a hand, and Viktor lets himself be pulled closer, blushes even more when Yuuri throws his arms around his neck and says, \u201cViktor, Viktor, you \u2013 you need to dance with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks around for help, but Chris seems to have melted into the crowd, so he says, \u201cOkay,\u201d and Yuuri grabs his hands and puts them on his hips, and Viktor is going to die. They keep dancing, and he catches glimpses of Chris but he\u2019s giving them a wide berth. He\u2019d make a note to yell at the other skater for setting him up later, except that Yuuri is gorgeous and the way he\u2019d skated earlier was great, and Viktor doesn\u2019t usually notice people like this. People get all flustered over him, but he doesn\u2019t tend to feel this way, he\u2019s not a casual person.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a drink,\u201d Yuuri says, eyes half lidded, \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both sweat soaked, and it\u2019s making the thin material of Yuuri\u2019s shirt cling to him in interesting ways, so Viktor swallows and nods. Yuuri grabs his hands and drags him to the bar. There\u2019s only one empty seat, and Viktor\u2019s about to offer it to him when he shoves Viktor into it, giving an absent minded, \u201cHere, you\u2019re too tall,\u201d and he isn\u2019t sure if he should be offended or not but he laughs anyway.</p>\n<p>Yuuri leans over to make eye contact with the bartender, which gives Viktor a lovely view of his ass in those tight, tight jeans. He\u2019ll never make fun of the skinny jean trend ever again. \u201cYuuri,\u201d he says. He turns to face him, and they\u2019re almost nose to nose and whatever Viktor was going to say flies right out his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes are blue,\u201d Yuuri says, moving closer and bracing his arm around Viktor on the bar, caging him in, \u201cLike \u2013 like \u2013 I\u2019m from a beach town, and they\u2019re like that perfect blue when the sun\u2019s reflecting off it on a clear day, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh <em>god</em>, a gorgeous man is waxing poetic about his eye color and pinning him to surfaces. He\u2019s never going to recover from this. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yuuri nods, intently serious, and he boosts himself up and suddenly Viktor has a lapful of Yuuri Katsuki.</p>\n<p>He forgets to breath as Yuuri knocks off those ridiculous glasses Chris had forced on him and he tilts his head up just enough to meet Yuuri halfway. He tastes like rum and sugar-sweetness from all those drinks, and he <em>can\u2019t</em> ask him back to his room, not like this, but when Yuuri kisses him he doesn\u2019t resist, opens his mouth up for him and digs his fingers into Yuuri\u2019s hips to keep him from sliding out of his lap.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri wakes up to the harsh ringing of his alarm and wants to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn that off!\u201d Chris groans. His friend is spooning him from behind, arm around his waist as he presses his face into his back.</p>\n<p>Yuuri dismisses the alarm and buried his head into his pillow. \u201cI have to get up. I\u2019m meeting someone at the rink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, <em>why</em>,\u201d Chris moans, \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stay,\u201d he says, untangling himself from Chris\u2019s grip and shedding the clothes from last night that he\u2019d fallen asleep in. At least he hadn\u2019t <em>lost </em>them, so that was an improvement. \u201cDid we get into a dance off last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d he groans, shoving a pillow over his head as Yuuri flings open the curtains.</p>\n<p>He considers showering, but he\u2019s only going to get gross on the rink anyway, so he forgoes that and starts pulling on his practice clothes. \u201cAnything interesting or more embarrassing than usual happen?\u201d He pokes at the finger shaped bruises on his hips, \u201cDid you do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You made out with Viktor Nikiforov and we got kicked out of a club for public indecency. Twice.\u201d He pauses, \u201cOnly the second time was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, \u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll take that as a no then. Text me what time your flight is, if it\u2019s late we\u2019ll get lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris waves a hand in agreement and Yuuri grabs his skates before bolting out of the room and running to the rink.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late!\u201d he says, and Yuri pauses mid-routine to smile at him. \u201cWhat did you want to work on today?\u201d</p>\n<p>They skate together like they have these past few days, and it\u2019s just a fun and easy between them as always. As the hour ticks by, Yuri gets quieter and quieter, and his lips barely twitch upwards when they step off the ice and head to breakfast.</p>\n<p>He can see that Yuri\u2019s upset, but trying to hide it, and this is <em>stupid</em>. They\u2019re helping each other out, and they get along, and it\u2019s perfectly normal for him to go, \u201cHey, give me your phone,\u201d in the middle of their shared plate of waffles. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuri raises an eyebrow but hands it over. Yuuri goes to the contact page and adds himself in there, including his skype and instagram even though he barely uses the thing. He\u2019d noticed Yuri was particularly fond of the app, and between him and Phichit he might actually get dragged into using it more than twice a year. \u201cI could still use your advice on jumps, if you have the time,\u201d he says, handing the phone back.</p>\n<p>Yuri takes it with a blank face, and Yuuri\u2019s worried he\u2019s done something wrong until the younger skater launches himself across the table and grabs him in what an octopus might define as hug. \u201cYes! Absolutely!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not a touchy person, but he laughs and hugs him back as his worries drain away. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The light of midday is streaming into his hotel room, but Viktor is still in bed, arm flung over his eyes and a grin he can\u2019t force down over his face.</p>\n<p>His phone beeps, and if it\u2019s Yakov he\u2019s ignoring it. But it\u2019s a text from Chris saying: <em>here\u2019s a commemorative photo.</em></p>\n<p>He flicks the message open, and it\u2019s from later in the night. He\u2019s back in those clunky glasses, Yuuri\u2019s arms are around his neck, and they\u2019re smiling at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he says quietly, hugs his phone to his chest not unlike a teenage girl, and wonders if making the photo his wallpaper would be too much.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phichit says as soon as he gets back, literally as soon as he walks through the door of their apartment. \u201cCongratulations on getting bronze. What\u2019s going on with you and Plisetsky?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello to you too,\u201d he says, stripping off his coat and dropping his bag to the ground. He\u2019d unpack and take care of it later. Long flights always left him exhausted. \u201cHow did you know I was with Yuri? Were you social media stalking me again?\u201d he collapses onto the couch, swinging his legs onto Phichit\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could I be?\u201d he complains, \u201cYou never post anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPhichit,\u201d he says, mock stern.</p>\n<p>The teen sighs and says, \u201cPlisetsky has a solid instagram. He posts his food when he goes out \u2013 and you were in some of them. Not all of you,\u201d he amends when Yuuri raises an eyebrow, \u201cjust like your elbow or a bit of your torso or something. But since I\u2019m your <em>best friend</em> and a brilliant detective, I figure these things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d noticed he\u2019d followed me on Instagram so your stalked his profile in terrifying detail?\u201d Yuuri translates.</p>\n<p>Phichit pretends to be offended for all of two seconds before going, \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe helped me with my jumps,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s thirteen!\u201d Phichit protests, \u201cWhy was <em>he </em>helping <em>you</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s good, what does his age matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Phichit says doubtfully, \u201cOkay, whatever. Have fun with your adopted little brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri snorts and rolls off the couch onto his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to go take a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood!\u201d Phichit calls after him, \u201cYou stink!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit had said it mostly as a joke, but as the months pass it seems to be more and more the truth. They text and skype, sending each other videos of their routines asking for advice and input. Yuuri talks to the kid more than he does his actual family, but \u2013 it seems to be doing both of them good.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard the rumors about the kid, that he was talented but also arrogant and bratty and a pain to deal with. He can see hints of that sometimes, when they two of them are arguing about a step sequence or choreography, but for the most part \u2013 well, if Phichit didn\u2019t have very reliable sources, he\u2019d think Plisetsky was a sweet kid. Mostly. He complains about his teammates and coach with a viciousness that Phichit personally finds concerning, but Yuuri just shrugs off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey treat him like a child,\u201d Yuuri explains, \u201cand he is, and you know, he needs normal teenage things like discipline and a schedule and boundaries. But treating him like a kid when it comes to skating is pointless. He\u2019s better than half the senior skaters already, and talking down to him only pisses him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit supposes that makes sense, and doesn\u2019t bring it up again. Besides, he may be right \u2013 no matter how much they argue about skating, Plisetsky never directs the contempt he seems to have for everyone else at Yuuri, so his friend must be doing something right.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is better for it too, somehow. Steadier, like being a crutch for Plisetsky had forced him to find firmer footing himself. He tries asking Celestino his opinion on everything, but their coach only says, \u201cI called Yakov and he\u2019s just as confused. We\u2019re just going to go with it for now.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t tell Phichit <em>anything</em> but if Yuuri\u2019s happy and the kid\u2019s happy that\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor leans back against the edge of the rink, refusing to admit he\u2019s pouting. He\u2019s looking in the direction of Yuri, who\u2019s spending their break at the other end of the rink typing rapidly on his phone. Since his grandfather isn\u2019t exactly a large fan of texting, there\u2019s only one person Yuri could be talking to. \u201cHe barely even yells at me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Georgi says, foregoing drinking his water in favor of dumping half the bottle on his face. \u201cHe still yells at you plenty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila goes on her tiptoes so she can rest her chin on Viktor\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s cute, he\u2019s made friends with his hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHero?\u201d Viktor demands, \u201cI thought I was his hero!\u201d</p>\n<p>Georgi raises an eyebrow. Mila moves from behind Viktor to lean over the barrier\u2019s edge so she can look at him pityingly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re his rival. He wants to beat you, not be you. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor crosses his arms and huffs, nose in the air, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so great about Yuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila jabs her fingers into his ribs, \u201cDon\u2019t be a jealous brat. I\u2019m sure he treasures you as a rival too.\u201d He yelps and skates away from her, betrayed. He\u2019d actually meant he didn\u2019t know what was so great about their Yuri that the Yuuri he\u2019d made out with was texting their rinkmate and not him, but considering he hadn\u2019t actually told any of them about that night he decides to let their mistaken interpretation stand.</p>\n<p>He wishes he could ask Yuri to pass on a message, or ask for Yuuri\u2019s number, but he really, <em>really</em> doesn\u2019t want to explain why he wants it.</p>\n<p>She sighs. Georgi hands her what\u2019s left of his water, and she sips at it. \u201cI am glad Yuri has a friend. He\u2019s not great about those.\u201d</p>\n<p>Georgi steals his water back, frowning. \u201cDo you think our Yuri has told his Yuuri that he\u2019s part of his online fan club?</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mila says, \u201cAlso don\u2019t you dare bring that up, we\u2019re not supposed to know that. You're lucky that\u2019s the most embarrassing thing you found on his phone - he\u2019s thirteen!\u201d</p>\n<p>Georgi hums and glides back into the center of the rink, unconcerned about his blatant disregard for other\u2019s privacy. Mila rubs at her forehead and goes to pull her skates back on.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s doing aerial yoga in the living room, hanging upside down by his hips. Phichit had been a little too eager when Yuuri had asked about installing the stripper pole, and he\u2019d had horrifying premonitions of his workouts ending up all over his friend\u2019s instagram. The aerial silk hook had been a compromise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHEY!\u201d Phichit walks into the room, waving Yuuri\u2019s phone, \u201cYour mini-me is calling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hates when you call him that,\u201d Yuuri sighs, holding out his hand, still upside down.</p>\n<p>Phichit gives him the ringing phone, \u201cI can\u2019t call both of you Yuri, and he gets all offended when I call him Yura.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, flicking his thumb across the screen, \u201cHey Yurochka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon,\u201d Yura returns, and Yuuri regrets telling him about his traditions regarding his favorite dish only because it had garnered that unfortunate nickname. Yura had screenshotted his contact lists, and Yuuri\u2019s photo was a picture of his mother\u2019s katsudon that he\u2019d sent him. \u201cAre you busy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He flips up and does a split in the air, then back over so his head\u2019s less than a foot from the floor. They really need to mop. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just hanging out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Yura says, \u201cCan you skype? I want some help with my routine, and Yakov keeps telling me to relax.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds relaxing,\u201d he observes, \u201cHold on, I\u2019ll call you back on skype.\u201d He disconnects the call, then calls back using the video service.</p>\n<p>Yura\u2019s face fills the screen, red and sweat drenched and with enough angry tension in his body that he\u2019s clearly two seconds away from snapping himself in half. He squints, \u201cAre you upside down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri says, and leaves it at that. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your routine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov keeps bitching about my step sequences not being fluid enough,\u201d he snarls, \u201cbut he\u2019s not telling me how to <em>fix</em> that and I\u2019m about to scream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurui flips back up again and shifts until he\u2019s lying in the silk like a makeshift hammock. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura nods and hand the phone to someone who obligingly holds it up so Yuuri can see the whole rink. He goes through his routine, and Yuuri has seen it before but he pays special attention this time to the transitions from jumps to presentation and back. Yura finishes with both arms outstretched before breaking the moment and angrily skating back over and snatching the phone from whoever had been nice enough to hold it. \u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see what he means,\u201d he admits, but when\u2019s Yura\u2019s shoulders get impossibly tenser he hurries to add, \u201cI think it\u2019s where your jumps are placed \u2013 as soon as you start to get in the groove of it you have a jump or a spin and you have to start all over again. It\u2019s hard to make it look fluid the way it\u2019s set up now, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> could do it,\u201d he accuses, ice blue eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth to deny it, but hesitates \u2013 Yura gets angry when he underestimates himself, which wasn\u2019t something he thought he did but Yura doesn\u2019t agree. He runs the routine over again in his head, and, well, Yura\u2019s not wrong. \u201cProbably. But I can\u2019t land my triples nearly as well as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>That seems to relax him a little at least, and he says, \u201cYes, you can. Have you talked to your coach about adding the changes <em>I</em> recommended for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried,\u201d he says, an unusual flash of irritation going through him, \u201cHe didn\u2019t think it was such a great idea.\u201d He barrels forward before Yura can start cursing Celestino, \u201cGive me like a day and I\u2019ll send you some ideas for reordering your routine around, okay? I usually end up designing my own step sequences for Celestino\u2019s routines anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura huffs, blowing his sticky bangs out of his face, \u201cOkay. But talk to your couch again. Your free skate isn\u2019t pushing you enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he agrees, already dreading the conversation, \u201cBut only if you get off the ice for today. You\u2019re not going to improve if you\u2019re too frustrated to focus.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment he thinks Yura is actually going to curse him out, but he bites it back and goes, \u201cFine. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow,\u201d and hangs up.</p>\n<p>Yuuri sighs and pulls himself up and out his silks. Phichit helps him fold it, mouth pulled down at the corners. \u201cNot to agree with the angry thirteen year old, but he\u2019s sort of right about Celestino.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re literally agreeing with the thirteen year old,\u201d Yuuri points out, tucking the silks into the corner, \u201cBesides, you love Celestino.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s great,\u201d Phichit agrees enthusiastically, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know, Yuuri. You\u2019re a brilliant skater. I feel like he should be giving you more complicated routines.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pinches the bridge of his nose, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it, I get enough of it from Yura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d his friend says agreeably enough, but Yuuri knows he hasn\u2019t forgotten it for a second.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks from his training and class schedule to his calendar, and he <em>could </em>do it. He hasn\u2019t taken too many days off this semester.</p>\n<p>Besides, most importantly, <em>he</em> would have liked to have someone there for him for his first serious competition.</p>\n<p>He opens his email to write a quick note to his professors.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Celestino stares. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Mexico?\u201d</p>\n<p>His student crosses his arms, \u201cIt\u2019s for three days. I\u2019ll be back on Sunday. Is there a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks toward Phichit, who only shrugs. Then back to Yuuri. \u201cNo,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cIs there \u2026 is there a <em>reason </em>you\u2019re taking three days off in the middle of training to go to Mexico? Not that that\u2019s a problem, but you\u2019ve never done it before. Ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri flushes and rubs the back of his head, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, because there\u2019s nothing else to say. \u201cHave a nice trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eldest student nods and walks out, presumably to pack. For his trip. To Mexico.</p>\n<p>\u201cBooty call?\u201d he asks hopefully.</p>\n<p>Phichit shakes his head, \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri is staring angrily at the ground as they wait for the ice to be cleared, and Yakov knows it\u2019s probably nerves, but Yuri\u2019s piece is about <em>innocence</em> and <em>childish discovery</em> and the red-hot anger that his youngest student bleeds constantly isn\u2019t the best mindset for this.</p>\n<p>He also doesn\u2019t know how to comfort him because he\u2019s a teenager who hates everyone and everything, but who will certainly hate himself if he messes up his short skate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYurochka!\u201d an unfamiliar voice calls out, and Yuri\u2019s head snaps up. Yakov doesn\u2019t know which reporter or fan just made that mistake, because the only person allowed to call Yuri that is his grandfather, and he throws a <em>fit</em> if anyone else does it \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon!\u201d Yuri answers, waving his arm in greeting, and the first smile Yakov has seen all day breaks out over his face.</p>\n<p>He turns and the Japanese skater who had altered his routine is hurrying towards them. He waits, because absolutely not is Yuri going to let this man get away with calling him that, no matter how happy he is to see him.</p>\n<p>Instead of yelling at him, however, Yuri leaps into the older man\u2019s arms, and Katsuki stoops over enough so that Yuri doesn\u2019t have to strain on his tiptoes. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he says, giving Yuri another squeeze before letting go. \u201cIt was harder to get security to let me back here than I thought it would be. I ended up taking a lot of selfies with security guards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Yuri demands, but he\u2019s beaming. \u201cThis is a junior only competition!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he smiles sheepishly, \u201cBut it\u2019s your first Grand Prix event! I didn\u2019t want to miss it. You\u2019ve been working so hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment where Yuri\u2019s absolutely still and Yakov has no idea what he\u2019s thinking. Then he gives Katsuki the smallest, sweetest smile he\u2019s ever seen him give anyone, and tackle-hugs him one final time before taking off his skate guards, shoving them at Yakov, and stepping on to the ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Katsuki swallows, eyes looking anywhere at Yakov, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for just showing up like this. I hope it\u2019s not too much of an inconvenience.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s clearly braced for a lecture. Katsuki thinks he\u2019s about to yell at him, but he came anyway because he wanted to support Yuri. Yakov curls half his mouth into a grin and claps him hard enough on the shoulder that he stumbles. \u201cThanks, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>By the time Yakov makes it to the rink the next morning, it\u2019s clear that that Katsuki and Yuri have already been there for a while, both of them sweat soaked as they skate through the end of Yuri\u2019s routine together, and it\u2019s like seeing double vision. It looks like Katsuki knows the routine by heart, and he has a sneaking suspicion that Yuri knows Katsuki\u2019s as well.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Yuri on the phone with the kid before, but in person is different. Yuri gives Katsuki a respect that he doesn\u2019t afford anyone, Yakov included, and he\u2019s less offended by that than he is intrigued.</p>\n<p>Yuri skates better with Katsuki around too, the other skater calming the nerves he denies he has just with his presence.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wonders how upset Celestino will be if he kidnaps his student.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri has just gotten off the plane in Detroit when his phone rings, Phichit\u2019s face filling up the screen. He\u2019s so tired all he wants to do is sleep for a week, and he\u2019s sure whatever his roommate wants to talk about can wait until he gets home. But it\u2019s also not like he has anything better to do while he\u2019s waiting for his cab, so answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you let it ring that long,\u201d Phichit scolds before he can get a word in, \u201cAnyway, you broke the internet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds unrealistic,\u201d he yawns, \u201calso, I barely use the internet.\u201d</p>\n<p>His cab finally shows up, and he gratefully slides into the back seat. \u201cYou may not, but everyone else does. Everyone\u2019s freaking out about you showing up GPJ Mexico and all the photos they got of you and Yurio together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio?\u201d he asks, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour sister suggested it, since it\u2019s not Yuri or Yura.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls back the phone in disbelief, staring at it like it\u2019s betrayed him, \u201cYou talk to my <em>sister</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t use social media,\u201d his friend complains, \u201cHow else is she supposed to know if you\u2019re alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy calling <em>me</em>?\u201d he says, \u201cHer brother?\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit makes a dismissive sound at the back of his throat, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Anyway, there\u2019s like a thousand photos of Yurio hugging you and the two of you getting breakfast and stuff everywhere. You and Yurio\u2019s fans are going crazy, they think it\u2019s the cutest thing ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fame part of his career has always been the hardest part to swallow. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>His friend\u2019s voice softens. He knows how Yuuri gets about his image and his fans and all the things off the ice that he wishes he didn\u2019t have to think about. \u201cYes, Yuuri. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, and doesn\u2019t know what to say besides that.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris looks at his phone and is seriously tempted to let it go to voicemail. Considering the deluge of photos Yuuri\u2019s been tagged in, this call can only be about one thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Viktor,\u201d he sighs, giving in, \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come he\u2019s friends with Yuri and not me?\u201d his friend whines into the phone, sniffing obnoxiously. \u201cI want to be his friend!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris rubs at his temples. If he\u2019d known inviting Viktor to go out with them would result in this many irritating phone calls, he wouldn\u2019t have done it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Less than two weeks after Yuri returns from JGP Mexico his instagram and twitter followers start aggressively tagging him in some sort of video. Confused, he opens it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Katsudon, clearly having just come from practice and doing his best to hide his irritation about being ambushed. \u201cYuuri,\u201d the reporter says off screen, \u201cIt\u2019s recently come to light that you have some sort of relationship with the debuting junior skater Yuri Plisetsky. Can we get a comment about that? Are you mentoring him? Showing a more inexperienced skater the ropes, as it were?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri snarls, because the way he\u2019s asking, the tone \u2013 he\u2019s not some charity case!</p>\n<p>Katsudon\u2019s eyes narrow and his lips go into a tight, hard line. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cYuri Plisetsky is an absolutely incredible skater, and any form of mentoring or teaching I may do is returned tenfold. I learn more from him every day, and couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the opportunities and growth his friendship has afforded me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of heavy silence, and the reporter recovers, \u201cWell, that\u2019s, I mean, do you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a class to get to, if you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d Yuuri cuts him off before turning and moving out of frame. The screen cuts to black.</p>\n<p>Yuri\u2019s grin is so wide it hurts, and his heart beats too fast in his chest. It\u2019s the nicest thing anyone has said about him. Ever. And Katsudon said it, his friend, he called him his friend! Which, Yuri knew on some level of course, you didn\u2019t skype someone three times a week and work on their routines and fly to Mexico for someone if they weren\u2019t your friend. Still \u2013 it was nice to hear.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t just say <em>nothing</em> about it, and he can\u2019t post a video in kind because Katsudon will think he\u2019s crazy and he\u2019ll feel crazy. So instead he retweets the video and just adds: <em>I feel exactly the same way</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Mila says, watching the video with Viktor and Georgi looking over her shoulders, \u201che must be dying right now. He hates confrontation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two pairs of suspicious eyes land on her. \u201cHow do you know anything more than we do?\u201d Viktor demands. There\u2019s something almost manic in his expression, and even Georgi gives him an odd look.</p>\n<p>The answer is Sara Crispino, who\u2019s one of the handful of people in the skating community who\u2019s actually <em>friends</em> with the reclusive Japanese skater. For someone who\u2019s by all accounts polite and good-natured, he doesn\u2019t seem to have that many.</p>\n<p>But that answer would open up questions on her relationship with Sara, and that\u2019s not a conversation she\u2019s interested in having at all. So instead she snaps, \u201cNone of your business,\u201d and flounces off away from her rinkmates.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri sits on the couch with his head in his hands. Phichit\u2019s got an arm around his shoulder attempting to comfort him. It\u2019s not nearly as effective as he probably hopes, considering Yuuri can feel him shaking from surprised laughter. \u201cWhy did I do that,\u201d he moans, \u201cPhichit I\u2019m <em>trending</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d he says, then winces when Yuuri glares at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad! If you want something bad I can post literally any of the photos from when I\u2019ve gone out with you and Chris. I\u2019m astounded there <em>aren\u2019t</em> any photos of you two honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody recognizes us with glasses,\u201d he grumbles, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how you keep getting away with following us. You\u2019re <em>eighteen</em>. Stop stalking and following us into clubs! One day we\u2019ll get caught and Celestino will kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>His phone rings. He just hopes it\u2019s not Celestino.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cYurochka,\u201d he answers, \u201cLook I \u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking, I didn\u2019t mean to blow this all up, I know I should have just walked away \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon!\u201d Yura snaps, waiting for Yuuri to take a breath. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>Oh</em>. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says, and the tight pit of anxiety loosens in his chest just the slightest bit. \u201cAre you ready for Belarus? Just because you won silver in Mexico isn\u2019t any reason to get arrogant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura scoffs, \u201cIt\u2019s only arrogance if I\u2019m not as good as I think I am. I\u2019m exactly as good as I think I am, because I have self-awareness. Unlike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, and they fall into the easy sniping back and forth.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris <em>seriously</em> considers letting the call go to voicemail, but he supposes he did this to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Viktor,\u201d he sighs, \u201cYou saw the video?\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds he phone away from him as Viktor wails in his ear.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit is twisted on the armchair doing homework, half-listening to Yuuri\u2019s conversation with his favorite Russian skater. And he\u2019s including his roommate\u2019s obsession with Viktor Nikiforov in that.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s laptop is in the middle of the coffee table, and he\u2019s got his physics homework spread out across every surface of the couch and the rest of the table, and he\u2019s not focusing on any of it. Instead he\u2019s leaning with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands listening to Yurio enthuse about his latest competition in Estonia, the one where he\u2019d finally qualified for the junior division of the Grand Prix Final.</p>\n<p>Phichit wants to be mad, because he\u2019s still competing as a junior and he hadn\u2019t qualified, but he can\u2019t. Yurio is actually that good, and the bubbly, innocent way he\u2019s describing everything to Yuuri is kind of endearing.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s first competition of the Grand Prix series is coming up \u2013 in two weeks he\u2019ll be heading to Canada. Phichit is sure once Yurio stops vibrating for long enough the conversation will circle around to it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s recently come to the uncomfortable realization that Yurio is more invested in Yuuri\u2019s success than Celestino. He still isn\u2019t sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cChris will be there,\u201d Yuuri says, and Phichit was right, they must be talking about Canada now, \u201cSo that will be fun at least. And it\u2019s a short flight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGiocometti?\u201d Yurio asks, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you knew each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t advertise it,\u201d Yuuri grumbles, and Phichit does his best not to laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s great! Really nice under all the \u2013 everything. But he\u2019s that friend that always talks you into bad decisions, you know? Then photographs it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit calls out, \u201cActually, I\u2019m usually the one photographing it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, \u201cWhatever, the point is I like Chris and it will be nice to see him. But also he encourages my drinking problem in really horrible ways and it\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence, long enough that Phichit looks up from his homework and Yuuri\u2019s eyebrows are dipped together. \u201cDrinking problem?\u201d Yurio asks, small and hesitant.</p>\n<p>Phichit cracks up laughing and Yuuri starts waving his arms in front of the monitor, \u201cNo! Not like \u2013 like anything like crazy, or a problem-problem, just you know, I get it from my dad, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlcoholism runs in your family?\u201d Yurio says, and actually sounds a little panicked so it\u2019s totally wrong of him to keep laughing but he does anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Yuuri yelps, \u201cNo, if anything that\u2019s Minako-sensei \u2013 not that she is either! I mean,\u201d he looks to Phichit, \u201cHelp?\u201d</p>\n<p>He drags himself from the chair and shoves Yuuri down so he\u2019s in the camera\u2019s view as well. Yurio\u2019s eyes are wide. \u201cChris is great! I love when he\u2019s around because our dear Yuuri doesn\u2019t have a drinking problem, he has a drinking <em>solution</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d his roommate says, head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t drink often but when he does \u2013 whoo boy! Clothes come off, dance moves come out. He and Chris have a <em>great</em> stripper pole routine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yurio says, but at least he doesn\u2019t look worried anymore.</p>\n<p>Phichit grabs his phone, \u201cDo you want to see pictures?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio says \u201cYes!\u201d the same time Yuuri yells \u201cNO!\u201d and tackles him to the ground.</p>\n<p>They can hear Yurio laughing as they wrestle on the floor for his phone, and it\u2019s then that Phichit realizes he\u2019s actually grown kind of fond of the brat.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mila shoves over a plate of fries to share with Yuri, who\u2019s grudgingly seated beside her in the rec room of the skating rink. The footage for the second day of Skate Canada is playing on both screens. Georgi is sitting at the table besides him, and Viktor left practice early so he could watch it at home. Yuri doesn\u2019t usually bother to watch the competitions live, but Mila knows that this change of behavior is due to one particular Japanese skater. \u201cWhat\u2019s his line up?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>He throws her an irritated glance, but doesn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand her. \u201cThird,\u201d he admits, \u201cAt least it\u2019s not first or last. I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do great,\u201d she says with a confidence she doesn\u2019t feel. He did okay on the first day, his score not breaking a hundred but getting close to it. She\u2019s heard he\u2019s nice, and his routines are <em>good</em>, and his step sequences can definitely be called amazing. But she doesn\u2019t really get the hero worship.</p>\n<p>He crosses his arms. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s about to try again, to say something that will get the scowl off his face, but his phone rings. He grabs it and is about to hit \u2018ignore\u2019 when he freezes, going pale. \u201cYuri?\u201d she asks, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t answer her, standing up so suddenly that his chair clatters to the floor and striding out of the room with the phone pressed to his ear.</p>\n<p>She looks to Georgi, who shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri gets on the podium, trying not to look stunned at his own success. He\u2019s got silver \u2013 barely \u2013 and Chris looks down at him from his place at gold and winks. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d he says, speaking through a smile as the cameras flash. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, giving a little wave to the cameras. He can see Celestino beaming behind them. \u201cI\u2019m not going out drinking with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that every time,\u201d Chris sing-songs. \u201cI\u2019m going to be up at your hotel room in an hour, so you might as well just agree so I don\u2019t have to drag you kicking and screaming like last year in Shanghai.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri sighs. It\u2019s true. Celestino has been no help at all, just telling him to have fun as Chris literally dragged him to the elevators. Sara had caught them in the hotel lobby coming back at four in the morning, and had deposited both of them into her room when they couldn\u2019t remember what their own room numbers were. Yuuri had woken up with a splitting headache to her brother yelling at him and Chris for deflowering his sister, something they absolutely hadn\u2019t done.</p>\n<p>Chris had flipped him off, rolled on top of Yuuri, and gone back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Michele still got twitchy whenever he saw either of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \u201cbut only if we don\u2019t go nearly as hard as we did in Shanghai.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Chris all but purrs, and Yuuri feels like he\u2019s lying to him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s back in his room, getting ready to shower, when his phone rings. He answers it immediately. \u201cYurochka! Were you watching? I did the third jump just like you said, and it went great!\u201d There\u2019s wet, heavy breathing at the other end, and his smile slides off his face. \u201cYurochka, are you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t watching, sorry,\u201d his voice is high and chocked, like he\u2019s trying to keep from crying. \u201cIt went well though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, forget about it,\u201d he says, sitting on the edge of his bed, \u201cTake a deep breath for me, okay? In,\u201d he waits until he hears Yura\u2019s shaky inhale, \u201cthen out. Again. In. And out.\u201d He continues until Yura\u2019s breathing doesn\u2019t sound so perilous. \u201cOkay. Now, what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re not hurt, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cNo, I \u2013 I\u2019m at the hospital, but I\u2019m not hurt. It\u2019s Grandpa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s hand cover\u2019s his mouth, and he swallows before asking, \u201cIs he \u2013 is \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d he says, and Yuuri\u2019s shoulders drop. \u201cHe fell, and messed up his back, and they have him in surgery now. He should be okay. They said he should be okay, so \u2013 so yeah.\u201d He sniffs and whispers, \u201cI\u2019m really scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he soothes, \u201cBut everything\u2019s going to be fine. Is Yakov there? Or anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yura says, which was the answer he was expecting but not the one he wanted, \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re the first person I\u2019m telling. I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t handle. Other people. Right now.\u201d His breathing hitches again, and he says, \u201cCan you \u2013 can you stay on the phone with me? Until, he, until Grandpa\u2019s out of surgery. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods before remembering Yura can\u2019t see it and says, \u201cOf course Yurochka. Whatever you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds his phone between his ear and shoulder, digging around his in his bag for his laptop. \u201cThank you,\u201d Yura says, \u201cTell \u2013 tell me about the free skate. It went well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he confirms, and launches into the story. He opens up his laptop and does two things \u2013 messages Chris that there\u2019s been an emergency and he can\u2019t go out, and googles how much a ticket to St. Petersburg will cost.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Celestino is still asleep in his room from his own night of drunken debauchery, thank god, but Chris is sitting on his bed watching Yuuri pack with an incredulous look on his face. He\u2019s still covered in body glitter from the night before, and his hair is damp from a shower. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can and I am,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cHis grandfather will be in recovery for weeks, <em>if</em> there are no complications, and he\u2019s only thirteen. He can\u2019t deal with that alone. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job,\u201d Chris insists, \u201cYuuri, you\u2019re doing so well this season! You can\u2019t just pack up to play nursemaid in the middle of it. You have the Trophee Eric Bompard in two weeks! You can't afford to interrupt your training by gallivanting off to Russia.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he zips up his suitcase, \u201cI have everything I need for competitions, and I\u2019ll have Phichit send me some clothes once I figure out where I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri!\u201d Chris grabs him by the shoulders, mouth turned down at the corners, \u201cThis is crazy! You don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He quirks a smile and takes Chris\u2019s hands off his shoulders, giving them a quick squeeze. \u201cYes, I do. Good luck in Tokyo.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leaves Chris alone in his hotel room, and pulls out his phone to make a quick call. \u201cSara, it\u2019s Yuuri. I need a favor.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been nearly two days since Yuri\u2019s grandfather was rushed to the hospital, and Viktor is worried. They\u2019re all worried, because he hasn\u2019t slept and he\u2019s barely ate but he keeps practicing, forcing himself to stay on the ice and work through his routine again and again long past the point where it\u2019s doing him any good. They\u2019re all taking a break, except Yuri, who\u2019d growled at Yakov when he\u2019d tried to force him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we sedate him?\u201d Georgi asks.</p>\n<p>Viktor snorts, \u201cHe\u2019d have to actually eat or drink something for that to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood point,\u201d he sighs, \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll pass out from dehydration or low blood sugar first?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov rubs at the bridge of his nose. \u201cProbably just plain exhaustion at this point.\u201d He glances at his watch, \u201cWhere\u2019s Mila? She\u2019s late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said she had to pick up the friend of a friend at the airport,\u201d Georgi says, \u201cIs he still staying at his place alone? Is that even legal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, excellent idea, let\u2019s call the cops on him, that will help,\u201d Yakov glares, \u201cI asked him to stay with me, but he turned me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame,\u201d Viktor says, \u201cOr at least to come by for dinner or \u2013 anything. He told me to leave him alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Georgi crosses his arms, \u201cWe have to do <em>something</em>. This is untenable. Especially since you two are leaving for the Cup of China tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is already cutting it way too close for my liking,\u201d Yakov says, \u201cI\u2019d originally planned for us to leave yesterday, before everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only be gone for a couple of days, then we\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Viktor assures.</p>\n<p>He rubs the back of his neck and looks back to Yuri, \u201cI know, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry. Mila and I will do \u2013 something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor and Yakov share a concerned glance. The dubious tone of voice does nothing to inspire confidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYUROCHKA!\u201d yells a voice Viktor may or may not have been dreaming about for the last several months. Yuri grinds to a halt, chest heaving.</p>\n<p>They all turn to look. Yuuri Katsuki is standing there, Mila at his side. He\u2019s clearly exhausted, bags under his eyes and hair a mess. He looks beautiful, and it would be completely inappropriate, but Viktor feels the urge to march over and kiss him anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Georgi says, \u201che must have come here straight from Canada. I can\u2019t believe Yuri told him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri goes skating towards him, and Yuuri drops his bags and runs to meet him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, is Yuri mad? Should we do something?\u201d Georgi continues.</p>\n<p>Yuri skates right to the edge then leaps into Yuuri\u2019s arms, legs around his waist and skates still on. He momentarily buckles under the weight, but then steadies and hugs him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Viktor says, heart pounding in his ears, \u201cI think we can safely say that he isn\u2019t mad.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Yura is shaking with barely controlled tremors as he clings to him. Yuuri braces one arm under Yura\u2019s thighs and the other around his back, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods against his shoulder, high hitching breaths as he tries and not to cry and fails. Mila is watching with a hand over her mouth, and he catches her eye and purposefully jerks his gaze down, hoping she catches his meaning without him having to say anything. She nods and kneels besides them, carefully unlacing Yura\u2019s skates and sliding them off, and Yuuri lets out a small breath. The last thing they need is someone accidentally getting sliced open.</p>\n<p>Yura doesn\u2019t protest, only criss-crossing his legs behind Yuuri\u2019s back once they\u2019re off. \u201cYou,\u201d he hiccups, \u201cyou - what are you,\u201d he shifts so he\u2019s pressing his facing into the juncture of Yuuri\u2019s neck and shoulder, and his face is wet on Yuuri\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be alone,\u201d he says, carefully walking over so he can lower them both onto the bench seats. Yura doesn\u2019t let go, only let\u2019s Yuuri readjust them so he\u2019s curled in his lap. \u201cI figured I\u2019d stay with you for a bit. If that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura nods, gripping him extra tight for a moment before relaxing. He still doesn\u2019t move to leave, and Yuuri\u2019s not about to make him, so that\u2019s how they stay for long minutes while Yura\u2019s breath evens out and eventually deepens. He knows the moment Yura falls asleep, his whole body going slack and heavy in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki,\u201d he looks up, and they\u2019re all clustered around, a respectful distance back except for Yakov who walks forward and carefully brushes Yura\u2019s hair back from his face. \u201cNice to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, \u201cI wish it could be under better circumstances.\u201d He leans back enough to get a better look at Yura\u2019s face. The crescent bruises under his eyes are dark and deep. \u201cHas he been sleeping at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is the first time since Nikolai was hurt,\u201d Yakov says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been eating either.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs, \u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t suppose you could call me a cab? I think I should take Yura home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take you,\u201d Viktor says, \u201cI have a key to Yuri\u2019s place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks and finally takes a good look at the other skater. He hasn\u2019t seen him since they went out drinking together with Chris months ago, and his memory of that ends somewhere around the time he started doing shots at the first club. Viktor only looks concerned and not like he\u2019s horrified to see Yuuri again, so he couldn\u2019t have done anything too embarrassing. He should really ask Chris for more details \u2013 all he knows is that they didn\u2019t get into dance off, which leaves a whole lot of other embarrassing behavior on the table. \u201cPlease. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor nods and quickly switches out his skates for sneakers. \u201cDo you need helps with\u2026?\u201d he gestures to Yura.</p>\n<p>He stands, shifting his grip so he\u2019s holding Yura bridal style with his head is lying against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get these, then,\u201d Viktor grabs Yuuri\u2019s suitcase and duffle, and gives him a movie star smile. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri gives his own weak grin in return, \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Georgi squints, \u201cDid \u2026 did Viktor just blush?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov and Mila turn to stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Viktor blushed,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m almost positive. At Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila rolls her eyes and glides back onto the ice, \u201cI think our lives are dramatic enough without you making stuff up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Georgi looks to Yakov, beseeching, \u201cYou saw it, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>His coach sighs, \u201cGet back on the ice, you over dramatic little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He huffs and skates back into the center of the rink.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t say much during the car ride there, and under normal circumstance Viktor would be thrilled to have Yuuri in his car, but these aren\u2019t normal circumstances.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d he says as he parks, looking into his mirror to where Yuuri is still holding Yura in his back seat. \u201cWe were getting really worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>He goes around back and helps Yuuri out, both of them being careful not to wake Yura up. \u201cAnytime,\u201d Yuuri says, \u201cI know Yura can be stubborn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHim? Stubborn? You don\u2019t say,\u201d Viktor teases, unlocking the front door, \u201cYura\u2019s room is down the hall on your left. I\u2019ll grab your bags.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods, taking careful steps, and Viktor ducks back out to grab his luggage from the trunk. He drops it off in the Plisetsky\u2019s guest room, and when he goes to Yura\u2019s room Yuuri is just pulling the blanket up over the kid\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d he asks, leaning against the door frame.</p>\n<p>Yuuri stretches, hands above his head and curving backwards until he\u2019s nearly touching the ground, his shirt sliding up enough to reveal a strip of pale skin. \u201cNo, that\u2019s al-\u201d he cuts himself off and straightens. \u201cActually,\u201d he says hesitantly, \u201cif it\u2019s not too much trouble \u2013 would you mind taking a quick trip with me to the grocery store?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he pushes himself off of the door frame, \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri honestly wants nothing more than to take a shower and go to bed \u2013 he hates long plane rides \u2013 but a free ride and a handy translator is too good to pass up. His Russian is limited to the few words and phrases he\u2019s picked up from Yura.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s seemingly fascinated with the array of ingredients Yuuri has picked out, and he instantly gets the impression that Viktor is one of those people whose fridge contains a dazzling array of microwavable dinners and little else. \u201cYou don\u2019t cook a lot?\u201d he finally asks when they\u2019re in the baking aisle, and Viktor is inspecting the shelf of different flours and sugars like he\u2019s never seen it before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m that obvious, huh?\u201d he says, giving him that thousand watt grin that makes Yuuri\u2019s heart skip a beat. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you had time to learn between skating and university.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor knows he goes to school? Has Yura been talking about him?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was before that, actually. My parents run a hot springs and restaurant. They taught me,\u201d he explains, \u201cOf course, this also means all the recipes I know are intended to feed about a dozen people. It\u2019s made making friends in college surprisingly easy.\u201d No one cared if you were quiet and awkward if you were feeding them. He pushes the cart out of that aisle and grabs a gallon of milk before swinging around to the produce section. He starts piling vegetables into the cart, and Viktor\u2019s eyebrows rise nearly to his hairline. Honestly, how is this man even alive?</p>\n<p>Viktor leans against the cart, and Yuuri pauses in his inspection of the tomatoes. He\u2019s not looking at him, and his smile seems almost \u2026 wistful, maybe, is the word. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. I usually eat alone. I guess that\u2019s why I never really learned to cook \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like there was much point if it was only me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares. He\u2019s almost certain that Viktor hadn\u2019t meant for that to come out as heart-wrenchingly sad as it had. His hand hovers over Viktor\u2019s forearm, hesitating because they barely know each other and it\u2019s not his place, but he\u2019s still looking at something Yuuri can\u2019t see, sad in some seemingly untouchable way that Yuuri, who has his family who\u2019s supported and loved him his whole life, who has Phichit and Sara and Chris, who often feels alone but never <em>lonely</em>, can\u2019t really understand.</p>\n<p>He grips Viktor\u2019s arm and squeezes, and his head snaps down so they\u2019re looking each other in the eyes. \u201cKatsudon is my favorite dish that my mother makes \u2013 it\u2019s where Yura got his nickname for me, its means pork cutlet bowl. When you get back from China, I\u2019ll make it for you. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri is not a nurturing person. He\u2019s not prone to cooking and looking after others, but he is a <em>caring </em>person. If looking after Yura keeps him sane, if cooking for Viktor gets that look off his face \u2013 he\u2019s more than happy to do it.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s eyes widen, and he smiles \u2013 something softer and more genuine than his normal grins, and all at once Yuuri is reminded of how incredibly <em>beautiful</em> Viktor is. He puts his hand on top of Yuuri\u2019s and says, \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yuuri says.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still holding the tomato.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri gets back to Yura\u2019s house, groceries on the table that Viktor had paid for despite his protests. He\u2019d said it was the least he could do considering everything Yuuri was doing, and had thrust his card at the bemused cashier.</p>\n<p>The house isn\u2019t a mess by any definition of the word, at worst it can be described as disheveled. But he does what he can, putting away the groceries and quickly throwing together a soup to slow-cook on the stovetop. Yura is still asleep, and when he wakes up he\u2019s going to insist that he eats something. He opens all the curtains, and even cracks a window for a few minutes let fresh air in until he can\u2019t take cold. He does what few dishes there are, and is in the middle of scrubbing down the counters when he hears a phone ringing.</p>\n<p>He blinks, looking around, because it sounds close so it\u2019s not Yura\u2019s and he knows it\u2019s not his. Then he catches sight of a phone attached to the wall, and to be honest he\u2019d completely forgotten that home phones even existed. He picks it up, just in case it\u2019s Yakov or one of Yura\u2019s rinkmates. \u201cPlisetsky residence, Yuuri speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence, and Yuuri\u2019s about to hang up when a gravelly voice barks, \u201cYou are not Yuri! Where\u2019s my grandson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Plisetsky,\u201d he says, startled, \u201cNo, I \u2013 I\u2019m Yuuri Katsuki, maybe your grandson has mentioned me \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon?\u201d he asks, the anger and worry draining from his voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in Japan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri relaxes, \u201cDetroit, actually, although I am from Japan. I just \u2013 Yura called me when you got hurt, and I just \u2013 I didn\u2019t want him to be alone. I was planning to stay with him until you\u2019re recovered, if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d he asks, \u201cIs he still at the rink?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks toward Yura\u2019s room, \u201cUh, no. He\u2019s asleep actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is?\u201d There\u2019s no mistaking the relief in his voice, \u201cHas he eaten anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m making soup now,\u201d he glances at the stove, and he should probably be stirring that. \u201cYakov told me he hasn\u2019t been eating, so I figured I should ease him back into it a bit. I don\u2019t want him getting sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. Yakov knows you\u2019re there? And Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Viktor drove me here,\u201d he says, leaving out the part where Yura passed out at the rink.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another long silence, and Yuuri\u2019s just starting to get nervous when Nikolai says, \u201cVery well, you can stay. Take good care of Yurochka,\u201d and hangs up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do,\u201d he sighs, speaking only to static, before hanging the phone up and going to check on the soup.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri wakes up slowly, eyelids heavy. He curls deeper into his bed, pulling the blankets tighter around him. Sleep is pulling him back, but hunger\u2019s also gnawing at his stomach for the first time since \u2013 since \u2013</p>\n<p>He shoots up, totally awake, and wrestles himself out of the blankets. It all comes flooding back, and it had to have been a dream, or a hallucination, or something. He skids to a stop in the living room, and Katsudon is there, eyes closed and in an improbable yoga pose. He looks up and smiles, untwisting himself to stand up straight, \u201cYou\u2019re up! Good. I made soup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really here,\u201d he says numbly. \u201cKatsudon, what \u2013 what are you <em>doing</em>! You have to be in France in two weeks! You don\u2019t have the time to babysit me!\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises an eyebrow and crosses his arms. \u201cNobody is babysitting anyone. If you\u2019re responsible enough to be an internationally competing professional athlete, then you\u2019re fully capable of spending your nights alone and feeding yourself if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Yuri relaxes a little, those words soothing a pride he hadn\u2019t even realized had been hurt. He wasn\u2019t a kid. He didn\u2019t need people fussing over him. \u201cHowever,\u201d Katsudon continues, \u201cthis is rough. It sucks. I thought you might want a friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does. Just having him there makes everything better, everything more tolerable. \u201cBut your competition!\u201d he insists, \u201cYuuri, you have a really good chance of qualifying for the Grand Prix Final. You need to be focused on that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve already looked into it \u2013 there\u2019s a rink nearby that I can practice at. I\u2019ll be <em>fine</em>, Yurochka. You\u2019re always saying Celestino is useless anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>He is, but even a shitty coach is better than no coach. But Katsudon has that frown that means he\u2019s going to be stubborn about this, and it\u2019s not like Yuri actually wants him to leave anyway. \u201cOkay. But you\u2019re not going to practice at some random rink with the public \u2013 you\u2019re coming and practicing with me at my rink.\u201d He opens his mouth to protest, but Yuri barrels forward, \u201cYakov and Viktor are going to be gone for the next couple of days anyway, and Mila and Georgi won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when Yakov gets back?\u201d Yuuri asks, eyebrow raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he answers, making a note to look up when Viktor\u2019s free skate will be over so he can give their coach a call after. He\u2019s not stupid enough to try to extract favors from Yakov before Vitya has secured yet another gold medal. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon uncrosses his arms and sighs, \u201cDeal. Now let\u2019s eat before the soup gets cold.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mila is getting ready for the day, putting on her workout clothes and running a brush through her hair. Considering the alarm she can hear blaring across the hall, she has another five minutes before Georgi groggily stumbles into her room accusing her of making them late. As if it\u2019s ever <em>her</em> fault that they\u2019re late.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s really planning to stay there?\u201d Sara asks, her face filling up the laptop screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d she says, and her hair is just barely long enough to pull back. \u201cI\u2019m glad, Yuri\u2019s still a kid. He needs someone looking after him, and he wasn\u2019t about to let any of us do it.\u201d She hesitates, dropping her arms and turning so she can actually see Sara\u2019s face. \u201cYuri brought him to the rink yesterday. Which is fine, he has his second qualifying event in less than two weeks, so it\u2019s for the best. He\u2019s nice, just like you said, but \u2013 uh, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like that great of a skater?\u201d Sara finishes knowingly.</p>\n<p>Mila lets out a great sigh of relief, \u201cYes! Not bad, of course, but not \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve seen him skate in competitions before, and that was better. I just \u2013 don\u2019t get it, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugs, \u201cHe\u2019s always been like that, don\u2019t worry about it. When push comes to shove, Yuuri will pull through, and besides this season he\u2019s doing better than ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Mila says, \u201cI have to get to the rink, I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit tilts his head to side and squints, \u201cAre you lying in a bathtub?\u201d</p>\n<p>His best friend rolls his eyes and shifts, and he can\u2019t see much more than Yuuri\u2019s face but it definitely looks like a bathtub. \u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want Yurochka to overhear and worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorry?\u201d he echoes, and tries not to let his voice pitch into hysteria, \u201cWhy would he worry? It\u2019s not like Celestino is threatening to drop you unless you get your ass on a plane back to Detroit or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh!\u201d he hisses, glancing anxiously off screen to what Phichit assumes is the bathroom door. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell Celestino about Yura\u2019s grandfather, he can\u2019t keep any secrets when he\u2019s drunk. I told him I needed to deal with a family emergency, I don\u2019t know what else he expects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you to stop acting like a crazy person maybe?\u201d he suggests.</p>\n<p>Yuuri glares, mouth tugging down at the corners. \u201cWell, he can drop me or not, but I\u2019m staying where I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>So <em>stubborn</em>. Phichuit frequently forgets how immovable Yuuri can be when he\u2019s made up his mind about something. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, not wanting to sit there having an argument he can already tell he\u2019s not going to win. \u201cHow are you doing practicing on your own?\u201d</p>\n<p>His face twists into a grimace, \u201cAbout as well as expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>,\u201d Phichit moans, putting his head in his hands and going back on the decision he\u2019d just made to say, \u201cThis is all such a bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an odd gasping sound coming from his monitor, and he peeks between his fingers to see Yuuri laughing so hard he can\u2019t even catch his breath. The knot of worry in his chest loosens at that, because the Yuuri he knew before Yurio would be midway through a panic attack with everything going on, but instead he\u2019s laughing at him.</p>\n<p>Maybe, <em>maybe</em> Yuuri knows what he\u2019s doing after all.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yura wanted to see his grandfather, but Nikolai hadn\u2019t wanted him missing practice to visit him, so the compromise was Yuuri and Yura getting up at the crack of dawn and taking a cab to the hospital.</p>\n<p>Yuuri didn\u2019t mind, not one to sleep much past sunrise anyway, but Yura had gotten into the back of the cab and curled up against him before falling asleep like a grumpy kitten. It was, quite frankly, adorable, and Yuuri twisted his arm at an awkward angle to snap a photo without waking him up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a short ride, and Yuuri finds himself shaking Yura awake and guiding him through the hospital. He\u2019s wondering if maybe going so early wasn\u2019t the brightest idea when they enter the room and Yura, without any sort of greeting, climbs into Nikolai\u2019s hospital bed and faceplants into his chest. Nikolai laughs and pats the top of Yura\u2019s head, and the two of them speak in soft Russian while Yuuri claims a chair by Nikolai\u2019s bedside.</p>\n<p>Some minute later, a gruff voice says, \u201cYou must be Katsudon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks up from scrolling through his instagram \u2013 damn Yura and Phichit both for getting him to use the damn thing \u2013 and smiles. \u201cYes sir,\u201d he stands and holds out his hand to shake, \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you. I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nikolai raises an eyebrow and looks from Yuuri\u2019s hand to Yura, who attempts to hide his snickers in his grandfather\u2019s shoulder. Yuuri\u2019s beginning to wonder if he\u2019s missed something when Nikolai\u2019s work-roughened hand closes over his own. However, instead of shaking it, he tugs Yuuri forward, causing him to stumble and fall into the older man. Nikola\u2019s arm comes across his back and squeezes, \u201cNone of that now. Thank you for looking after our Yurochka. It\u2019s much easier to focus on getting better and out of here knowing that he\u2019s with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes and hesitantly hugs back once he feels Yura\u2019s arms joining his grandfather\u2019s, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Nikolai,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s laughing at him but it\u2019s also equally clear it\u2019s not malicious so he only nods.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris\u2019s alarm goes off, and he blindly reaches out an arm to snatch his phone of his bedside table and hit snooze. He blinks some of the sleep from his eyes, huddling beneath the warmth of his duvet as he unlocks his phone to check his facebook and twitter.</p>\n<p>He blinks again, slower this time, wondering if he\u2019s still asleep, and scrolls quickly through the rest of his feed, seeing the same thing over and over. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, faint because it\u2019s too early to curse and he\u2019s not fully awake yet. It has to be some sort of mistake, because he would have heard about it if it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He considers calling one of them, either to find out what exactly is going on or to give them a heads up, but it\u2019s <em>early</em> and he\u2019s sure to hear about it anyway so he tucks his phone under his pillow and works on catching some extra precious minutes of sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor beams, the gold medal around his neck, and carefully steps off the podium to walk over to Yakov and the hoards of reporters. He slows, however, when he sees Yakov frantically shaking his head and miming a zipping motion over his mouth. What on earth\u2026?</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Nikiforov!\u201d one of the reporters calls out, and Viktor shrugs it off and strides forward, million-watt smile on display. \u201cCan you confirm the existence of a romantic relationship between yourself and Japanese skater Yuuri Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>What?</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only through years of practice that he keeps his smile from slipping, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two have already moved in together,\u201d another reporter adds, which is certainly news to him, \u201cthings must be serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny talk of an engagement?\u201d a third one asks, and he shoots Yakov a panicked glance, because on one hand he and Yuuri \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 aren\u2019t dating and definitely aren\u2019t engaged, but on the other hand Yakov clearly doesn\u2019t want him to say anything, and why exactly is he getting asked these questions now?</p>\n<p>His mind flashes to the photo on his phone, and if it turns out Chris leaked photos of the two of them from when they\u2019d gone out together after the last World Championships he\u2019s going to strangle him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d Yakov says gruffly, latching onto Viktor\u2019s elbow and dragging him away from the throng of reporters. He gives them a little wave but allows himself to be pulled away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demands once they\u2019re away from prying eyes, \u201cWhat are they all talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov hold out his phone. The headline \u2018SECRET LOVE AFFAIR REVEALED\u2019 is stamped along the top, and below it is a photo. It\u2019s the two of them, taken just a couple days ago from when they were grocery shopping. They\u2019re looking into each other\u2019s eyes and their hands are tangled together. Yuuri is holding a tomato.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a damning picture. Viktor knows it was just Yuuri feeling sorry for him and offering to cook him dinner, but it certainly looks like they\u2019re lovers, like Yuuri is a moment away from closing the few inches between their lips. But he\u2019s not. \u201cSo they have a picture,\u201d he says, tearing his eyes away and looking at his coach, who\u2019s now frowning at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake, why didn\u2019t we just say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tell them what?\u201d he asks, \u201cThat Katsuki is taking an extended vacation to St. Petersburg in the middle of competition season for no reason? That\u2019s believable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Viktor says, finally understanding. The public doesn\u2019t know Yuri\u2019s grandfather is injured, because it\u2019s none of their business. Yuri didn\u2019t even want <em>their</em> sympathy, never mind his thousands of fans. \u201cWe need to talk to Yuri. Both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Thankfully, they\u2019d gotten to the rink before the story had broken, and hadn\u2019t even known about it until Mila and Georgi had burst inside, eyes wide and frantic. Both of them had been babbling in Russian so Yuuri hadn\u2019t caught a word, but Yura had paled and skated over to the edge of the rink, frantically grabbing for his cell phone. \u201cMind filling me in?\u201d he asks, skating to the edge and leaning against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone thinks you and Viktor are dating,\u201d Yura answers, and he stares.</p>\n<p>Georgi holds out his phone, looking vaguely apologetic, \u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s all over \u2013 everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he says faintly, looking down at the photo and scrolling through the <em>hundreds</em> of comments. He thinks he\u2019s going to pass out.</p>\n<p>At that moment, Yura\u2019s phone starts ringing, and he answers it immediately, barking, \u201cViktor, <em>what the hell</em>.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause. \u201cYes, he\u2019s here. No, you can\u2019t talk to him, you psycho. Tell me why you haven\u2019t released a statement yet.\u201d There\u2019s another long pause, and Yuri resists the urge to ask Yura to put in on speaker. His face pinches and he says, quieter this time, \u201cOh. Okay. Hold on, we\u2019re not doing this through a phone call, at least let me call you back on skype.\u201d He hangs up and sighs, closing his eyes and breathing out slowly.</p>\n<p>Yuuri skates over and puts an arm around his shoulders, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura opens his mouth, closes it, and winds his arm around Yuuri\u2019s waist so they\u2019re pressed side to side. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, giving a half smile. He calls back on skype and holds up the phone they\u2019re both in view.</p>\n<p>Viktor and Yakov\u2019s faces fill the screen. Viktor\u2019s biting his lips and his eyebrows are dipped together, while Yakov\u2019s face just gives the vague impression of concern while remaining completely blank. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this!\u201d Viktor blurts.</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks, taken aback, \u201cWhy? We got photographed, it happens, and it\u2019s certainly not your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone right now?\u201d Yakov asks, cutting off whatever Viktor was about to say.</p>\n<p>His face heats up, \u201cUh \u2013 no, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yakov nods, \u201cthen congratulations \u2013 for the foreseeable future, you and Vitya are dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can feel the all blood that had just rushed to his face drain from it, which can\u2019t be healthy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you ask me if <em>I\u2019m </em>seeing anyone?\u201d Viktor whines before what Yakov just said seems to catch up with him and he says, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier than trying to concoct some other excuse,\u201d Yakov says, \u201cand it\u2019ll only be for a month or so anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I just look like a crazy person who abandoned my coach to live in Russia in the middle of competition season for my boyfriend,\u201d Yuuri sighs, and tries not to think of the absolute fit Celestino is going to throw over this. He\u2019s still not planning on telling his coach why exactly he\u2019s here, and now with this story everywhere he\u2019s sure to be furious.</p>\n<p>Yura tenses all along his side and he looks down in concern. \u201cNo,\u201d Yura says, hands clenches, \u201cno that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not fair. We\u2019ll just tell everyone the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov shakes his head, \u201cNo, Yuri\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he cuts him off, \u201cNo. It\u2019s not fair to drag down Katsudon\u2019s reputation just to keep me out of the news. It\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019ll tell everyone the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a nice gesture \u2013 an <em>amazing</em> gesture \u2013 but Yuuri isn\u2019t about to let it happen. \u201cYurochka,\u201d he says, squeezing his shoulder until the younger boy looks up at him, \u201cNo. Thank you \u2013 but no. Your personal life isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s concern, and the last thing you want to do is start letting the media butt into your privacy. We\u2019ll go with the cover story,\u201d he looks to Viktor, who gives a determined nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut now they\u2019ll be butting in to <em>your</em> privacy,\u201d Yura argues.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, even though it\u2019s really not, even though he <em>hates </em>the media prying into his life, hates the fame that comes with his passion. Pretending to be Viktor Nikiforov\u2019s boyfriend is only going to make all that so much worse. But Yura is a kid, he\u2019s only thirteen, and the only thing worse than the public prying into his own personal life is them dragging out all the dirty details of Yura and his grandfather, is the whole world putting Yura\u2019s pain on display like they have some sort of right to it. So Yuuri pushes all his fears down to say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Yura. Viktor and I can handle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura doesn\u2019t look away, searching Yuuri\u2019s face for a long moment before nodding and leaning back against Yuuri\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s settled then,\u201d Yakov says, \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the airport now. See you in about,\u201d he checks his watch, \u201cfifteen hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fifteen hours. Cool. Fifteen hours to prepare himself to act like the boyfriend of his idol. This is fine.</p>\n<p>Oh god, he needs to talk Phichit.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri waits until they\u2019ve snuck their way back home and Katsudon\u2019s in the shower to call Yakov. He\u2019s a little bit gratified when he picks up by the time the second ring is done, \u201cYura? Is something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides everything?\u201d he snarls before remembering he\u2019s calling because he wants something and he should at least make a little bit of an effort at not being a brat. \u201cI mean \u2013 yes, something\u2019s wrong. I need a favor. A big favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you to train Katsudon too, while he\u2019s here,\u201d he says, \u201cHe\u2019s good, and he\u2019s doing so well this season. I try to help \u2013 I <em>do</em> help \u2013 but I\u2019m not a coach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov snorts before saying dryly, \u201cIt\u2019s good to know you\u2019re aware of at least some of your limits.\u201d Yuri doesn\u2019t even have the time to get offended before he continues, \u201cYura, of course. By helping you he\u2019s helping all of us.\u201d The relief is so immediate and staggering that he has to lean against the wall for support. He\u2019d been so afraid that he\u2019d doomed Katsudon to failure by needing him, and even if Katsudon was okay with that he isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve tried calling Celestino but he\u2019s not answering my calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShocking,\u201d Yuri says, but he\u2019s grinning. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov grunts, somehow managing to still sound vaguely pleased, and ends the call.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris is mid-practice when his coach calls out, \u201cYour phone\u2019s ringing! It\u2019s Nikiforov!\u201d</p>\n<p>He immediately abandons his step sequence to rush over and snatch his phone away, ignoring Josef\u2019s exasperated look. He\u2019s been <em>waiting</em> for one of them to call him, and he doesn\u2019t bother to keep the delight from his voice when he answers, \u201cCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials. If I\u2019m not the best man I\u2019m going to be very cross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut <em>up</em>,\u201d he moans, \u201cwhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, I\u2019m assuming,\u201d he says, and laughs outright when Viktor makes a choking sound at the other end.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris leans over and snatches a towel from Josef\u2019s outstretched hand, wiping the sweat from his face. \u201cSo am I. What\u2019s the problem here? The man you\u2019re obsessed with is now your media-boyfriend. Could it get any more perfect?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want him to be my real boyfriend! Not my media-boyfriend!\u201d he insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell considering you\u2019ve made exactly zero progress with that on your own, this seems like a perfect opportunity. This time you just have to seduce him without alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor groans, \u201cI didn\u2019t seduce him last time! He seduced me!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good point. \u201cHe probably won\u2019t do that again without alcohol.\u201d There a long silence. Chris raises an eyebrow, \u201cViktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says quietly, \u201che\u2019s been doing a pretty good job of it so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cOh my god,\u201d Chris laughs, and then hangs up on principle. His phone is instantly ringing again, and he answers \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asks not-Viktor, \u201cChris?\u201d</p>\n<p>He winces, \u201cYes, sorry, I thought you were someone else. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as he says it he realized that it\u2019s a ridiculous question. Yuuri answers, \u201cPhichit didn\u2019t answer. I left him a message. In the meanwhile,\u201d he takes a deep breath, and Chris has enough foresight to pull the phone away from his ear.</p>\n<p>He can still hear Yuuri screaming from the speaker, and by the time he stops laughing long enough to bring the phone back to his ear Yuuri\u2019s already hung up.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to go with you?\u201d he asks for the fifth time.</p>\n<p>Katsudon sighs, \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. The whole point of this is to keep you away from the media circus, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>He crosses his arms, \u201cI don\u2019t like you going alone. They\u2019re going to eat you alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence,\u201d he says dryly, and Yuri can tell he\u2019s not actually offended so he doesn\u2019t bother to apologize. \u201cI\u2019ll go pick them up, get a few pictures taken, and I\u2019ll be right back. It shouldn\u2019t take more than an hour or two.\u201d Yuri stares. No way is he that stupid. Eventually Katsudon sighs and says, \u201cLet me hope, okay? I promise to come back with all my limbs attached at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives in, uncrossing his arms, but can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYou\u2019re not going in that, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon looks down at his sweatpants and longsleeve, \u201cI was planning on it. Why?\u201d There\u2019s not enough time in the world to talk about everything wrong with it, and they have less than an hour before Katsudon ha to leave. He pulls out his phone, firing off a rapid text to Mila and Georgi since they only live a couple miles from Viktor\u2019s apartment, and doesn\u2019t put it in their rinkmates group chat specifically he doesn\u2019t want the older man to see it. If he hadn\u2019t wanted them going through his things he shouldn\u2019t have given them all keys to his place. \u201cYura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo put on some jeans,\u201d he says, not looking up from his phone as Mila and Georgi start sending him pictures of their options, \u201cthe too-tight skinny ones. I know Phichit sent them. And a white button up, you have like five of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDenim is cold!\u201d he protests, \u201cI\u2019ll freeze!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stabs a finger towards the guest room where Katsudon is staying, \u201cMarch. That wasn\u2019t a suggestion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon throws up his hands, but does as he\u2019s told with a minimum amount of grumbling. If Katsudon is going to put himself under a microscope for Yuri\u2019s benefit, the least he can do is make sure the press doesn\u2019t literally tear him apart.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor <em>had </em>expected the horde of reporters when he stepped out of baggage claim. What he hadn\u2019t expected was Yuuri to be there waiting for him as well, looking absolutely delicious. Or wearing his grey waistcoat and favorite black silk tie, and jeans that look like they\u2019d been poured on. The cameras are already flashing when Yuuri runs over to him and throws his arms around his neck. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind about the borrowed clothes,\u201d he whispers, going on his tiptoes so he can speak directly into his ear, \u201cYura insisted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he says back, throat dry, and keeps an arm around Yuuri\u2019s waist as he shifts to stand at his side instead. Oh god, is Yura trying to kill him? \u201cFeel free to take whatever you like.\u201d He immediately flushes and calls himself ten kinds of idiot. Yakov has a sudden coughing fit that probably looks natural to everyone else, but Viktor knows his coach is laughing at him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri flashes a smile at him that makes him melt, \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d He takes Viktor\u2019s hand and laces their fingers together, \u201cReady to face the music?\u201d</p>\n<p>He squeezes Yuuri\u2019s hand and says, \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit is conflicted. On one hand, Celestino is absolutely furious and he thinks they might have passed the point of no return, even if Yuuri were to get on the phone this instant and tell their coach everything. On the other hand, his best friend is in a Hollywood relationship with his childhood celebrity crush and splashed on the cover of every news outlet that\u2019s even remotely invested in the skating world.</p>\n<p>His phone rings, and he answers it without looking. \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIS THIS REAL?\u201d two voices yell in his ear.</p>\n<p>He winces and holds the phone farther away, \u201cHi Guang-Hong, and \u2013 Leo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d they both answer at the same time. Again. Phichit hadn\u2019t eve known they were currently in the same country. \u201cThis whole \u2013 Yuuri and Viktor thing. It\u2019s real, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, very real,\u201d he answers, because he\u2019s not about to go spilling Yurio\u2019s secrets, even to his closest friends. And also because he\u2019s having <em>entirely </em>too much fun. \u201cIt was kind of a whirlwind romance, you know? One second they barely know each other, the next Yuuri\u2019s jumping on a plane to Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more screaming, and Phichit covers the bottom of his phone so they can\u2019t hear him cackling to himself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s their first morning all training together, and Yuri is grateful that Katsudon is here, loves practicing with him and the others. What he doesn\u2019t love is how Katsudon\u2019s nerves are making it impossible to get through his routine while everyone else is watching him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s flubbing spins that Yuri knows for sure he could make in his sleep, and his eyes keep darting to the others, Viktor especially, like he\u2019s afraid they\u2019re judging him and finding him wanting. He falls while attempting a jump, and Yuri has officially had it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay everyone!\u201d he claps his hands, getting everyone\u2019s attention on him and away from Katsudon. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s lunchtime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s eleven,\u201d Georgi protests, \u201cWe\u2019ve only been a few hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrunch then,\u201d he insists stubbornly, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>Viktor darts his gaze from Katsudon then back to him, and says, \u201cIf this is about \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Goodbye now</em>,\u201d he cuts him off, glaring, because when it comes to skating Viktor may be a genius but with everything else he\u2019s a <em>moron</em>.</p>\n<p>He will literally start shoving people off the ice if he has to, but Yakov sighs and calls out, \u201cLet\u2019s take an early break. My treat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we try the new bakery that opened up down the street?\u201d Georgi demands with an intensity Yuri would mock him for if it were any other time. He has the worst sweet-tooth that Yuri has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Yakov rubs at his forehead, \u201cYes, Georgi, we can go to the new bakery down the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone leaves the ice, talking amiably and pointedly not looking behind them. Katsudon skates over, \u201cYura, you really didn\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waits until they\u2019re gone to face him and answer, \u201cYes, I really did. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Katsudon bites his lip and looks away, and he continues, \u201cNever mind, you\u2019re right, that was a stupid question. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, looking back and forcing a smile, \u201cYou know, maybe it\u2019s best if I just practice on my own like I was planning to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it will be so much easier to skate in front of a whole bunch of strangers than a couple of fellow skaters? Besides, it\u2019s not like the paparazzi is following you around or anything \u2013 oh wait, just kidding, they are.\u201d Katsudon rolls his eyes, but he\u2019s not as tense now, which had been the point. \u201cYou have to leave for France in a week, okay, so just \u2013 you know this routine. You\u2019ve done it a thousand times. You <em>can </em>do it \u2013 there\u2019s no part of it that\u2019s outside your skills, okay? I know how you get, with the \u2013 with people and the expectation, and all that crap.\u201d He grabs Katsudon\u2019s hands, and implores, \u201cThere\u2019s no one else here, okay? It\u2019s just me. <em>Me</em>. I already know you\u2019re great, I\u2019m not someone you need to impress. So just skate it for me. Like you mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon smiles and pulls his hands back so he can ruffle Yuri\u2019s hair, \u201cI - okay, Yurochka. I\u2019ll skate it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri beams and skates to edge of the rink, smile wide and eager.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor feels a little bad about the fact that they\u2019re all hiding just out of sight and spying on Yura and Yuuri, but it wasn\u2019t his idea.</p>\n<p>It was Yakov\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Mila\u2019s piggybacking on Georgi\u2019s shoulders so she can see, and Viktor is reminded again that in spite of how antagonistic their relationship can be at times, the two of them have been friends since they were kids. Like proper little kids, before either of them got into skating.</p>\n<p>Viktor doesn\u2019t talk to anyone that he knew before he started skating.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Mila says faintly. Viktor curses at himself for getting distracted focuses back on the ice.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s skating, but instead of the high strung mess he was just moments ago \u2013 it barely looks like he\u2019s skating, it looks like he\u2019s flying. His movements are so fluid and natural that it barely looks like he\u2019s touching the ice. His spins are gorgeous, and his flips are neat and precise. He makes it all look easy, but if Viktor tried to do jumps that complicated at the end of a routine \u2013 especially after practicing for hours beforehand \u2013 he would fall flat on his face and possibly break his leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess Yuri\u2019s obsession wasn\u2019t all hype,\u201d Georgi\u2019s eyebrows are nearly to his hairline. \u201cFuck, Viktor, you better watch out. If Katsuki gets his shit together, you\u2019re going to be out of a gold medal.\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels the beginnings of genuine excitement and nervousness. Not to disparage other skaters, never ever to talk ill of the talented people he shares the ice with \u2013 but it\u2019s been <em>so long</em> since he looked at a fellow competitor and saw a <em>challenge</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris is eating breakfast when his phone rings. This time he doesn\u2019t hesitate at all before answering. \u201cHave you slept with Yuuri yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Viktor says, sounding shocked at the suggestions and Chris resists the urge to bang his head against his kitchen table. He\u2019s tempted to fly out to Russia himself and knock some sense into both of them. Even if Yuuri is embarrassed about their drunken night out, he\u2019s certainly not embarrassed enough to tell Viktor no if the giant moron would just make a proper move instead of just moping around everywhere like a love-struck fool</p>\n<p>Why are his friends so exhausting?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now,\u201d Chris informs him, \u201cCall me back when you have a boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWAIT!\u201d Viktor says, and he sounds serious, for once. \u201cJust \u2013 hold on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris frowns, \u201cOkay, okay. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s about half a minute of silence, and he\u2019s about to hang up for real when Viktor blurts, \u201cSo \u2013 so Yuuri\u2019s, uh, kinda good. At skating.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives in and lies face down on the table since he can\u2019t give Viktor an exasperated stare over the phone. He hopes they\u2019ve been friends for long enough that he picks up on it anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s the best figure skater in Japan, but yeah, okay, we can go with kinda good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I meant \u2013 I think he might be the best figure skater not in Japan. I mean, uh, I mean that\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw him skate alone,\u201d Chris deduces, smirking, \u201cTerrifying, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh my god</em>,\u201d Viktor hisses, somehow managing to sound distressed and impressed at the same time, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>He straightens enough so that he\u2019s only slouched on the table and not lying across it, \u201cBasically, yeah. I\u2019ve practiced with him a few times where it was just the two of us, and it\u2019s just as crazy every time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been able to skate like that?\u201d Viktor demands.</p>\n<p>Chris shrugs, \u201cMore or less. He has a heavy background in ballet, he could have done that professionally instead. It shows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Viktor says, different this time, and Chris hangs up.</p>\n<p>He already knows Yuuri is amazing and gorgeous. He <em>really</em> doesn\u2019t need to listen to Viktor wax poetic about it for the next hour.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier after that, skating in front of the others. He still gets anxious, but it\u2019s not as bad, and he can just close his eyes and pretend he\u2019s skating for Yura alone, and that makes it better. Yakov helps too, the old man gruff and endlessly patient. He yells at the Viktor and Yura but never at him, nor at Georgi and Mila, and he watches Yakov closely after he notices that.</p>\n<p>Celestino had always treated his students the same, insisting that he would never play favorites, but Yakov doesn\u2019t do that. Not exactly. His students are different, so he treats them differently. Viktor is easily distracted and has to be steered on course more often than not, and Yuri\u2019s focused, too focused sometimes, and Yakov spends more time yelling at him to get off the ice than on it. Mila gets dry sarcasm and critiques that sound like suggestions, while Georgi is given frank, straightforward corrections but only in encouraging and gentle tones.</p>\n<p>Yakov treats him differently too, and it throws him at first. He treats him almost like he treats Viktor \u2013 no yelling or corralling, but he doesn\u2019t tell either of them what to do. He only says, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t enough rotations,\u201d or \u201cYour back isn\u2019t straight enough.\u201d He\u2019s not sure what it means at first, and he\u2019d think it means Yakov isn\u2019t interested in training him, except treats Viktor the same way. He\u2019s obviously invested in training Viktor, so Yuuri just doesn\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks and looks up, and Viktor is standing too close except that Yuuri doesn\u2019t feel the urge to move away at all. He\u2019s sweat soaked and his hair is sticking to his face, still beautiful and close enough that Yuuri can feel his whole body heat up. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it get in your eyes?\u201d he asks, reaching up and pushing Viktor\u2019s hair back from his face.</p>\n<p>Viktor leans into his hand, and it\u2019s so unexpected that he freezes, so he\u2019s standing their cupping Viktor\u2019s cheek. \u201cSays the man who skates all his competitions half-blind,\u201d he teases. \u201cYou might have heard of this new invention called contact lenses?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey irritate my eyes,\u201d he says, and feels himself moving an extra inch closer since he can\u2019t think of a non-awkward way to reclaim his hand with Viktor still nuzzling it. He\u2019s not sure he wants to anyway. He\u2019s gotten mostly used to the casual touches when they\u2019re in public, Viktor\u2019s hand on his waist or their fingers tangled together. But they\u2019re not in public now, there\u2019s no media to make a show for, but Viktor seems to be moving impossibly closer anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri jerks away, eyes wide and heart pounding. Yura skates over and grabs his hand, pulling him away, \u201cYura, what \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need some help with my spins,\u201d he insists, addressing him but looking past him to \u2013 is he <em>glaring </em>at Viktor?</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks, \u201cAh, okay, Yura. Of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>He starts to skate away and Viktor says, \u201cWe should go on a date tonight!\u201d Yuuri\u2019s mouth drops open, and Viktor hastily adds, \u201cFor \u2013 for the press, right? To put in an appearance. I\u2019ll pick you up at eight?\u201d</p>\n<p>For their dedicated band of paparazzi. Right. \u201cSure,\u201d he says, and oh god, he has to be so red right now, someone kill him and put him out of his misery. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 sure, yes. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon,\u201d Yura hisses, tugging on his arm, and he throws Viktor a smile that hopefully doesn\u2019t look too panicked before allowing Yura to pull him to other side of the rink.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yakov holds his head in his hands. Mila is nearly as red as her hair from her attempts to not burst out laughing, and Georgi makes stabbing motion to the rink and says, \u201cI told you! Viktor has a crush on Yuuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is <em>amazing</em>,\u201d Mila says fiercely, \u201cOh my god, this is perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov slowly lowers his hands. He should say something, he should <em>really</em> say something, but there\u2019s not a single bit of him that wants to get involved in his students\u2019 love lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a drink,\u201d he says, choosing the best course of action and walking away.</p>\n<p>Georgi calls after him, \u201cIt\u2019s ten in the morning!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock somewhere,\u201d Mila sing songs, and he should really work on getting students that aren\u2019t going to give him ulcers.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit is exhausted and gross, but Yuuri had texted asking for a skype session when he got home so he obliges, collapsing into his computer chair and calling him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri answers almost immediately, pale and frazzled. He only has a moment to worry that something\u2019s gone seriously wrong before he says, \u201cI\u2019m going on a date! With Viktor! In public!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you gone on dates with Viktor not in public?\u201d he asks immediately, waggling his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Yuuri moans and grabs the edges of his laptop, his face suddenly taking up most of the screen. \u201cPhichit, I\u2019m serious! What do I wear! We haven\u2019t \u2013 the most we\u2019ve done is go on a coffee run together so the media could snap some photos, I wasn\u2019t expecting to have to go on a <em>date</em> with him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d he says, grinning and not even trying to sound sympathetic. \u201cI know you\u2019re not the type to put out on the first date, but I think this should be an exception.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri leans back, looking completely scandalized, as if Phichit hasn\u2019t personally witnessed him leave a trail of broken hearts all over campus. He\u2019s about to make fun of him specifically for that reason there\u2019s a loud bang of a door slamming a wall and Yurio strolls into the screen. \u201cWhat are you guys screaming about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri can\u2019t decide what to wear,\u201d Phichit answers, deciding to gloss over the part where he\u2019s encouraging his best friend to ride Nikiforov\u2019s dick into the sunset.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you went to Phichit?\u201d Yurio demands, crossing his arms. \u201cI am <em>offended</em>, Katsudon.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t look that offended, lips turned up the tiniest bit at the corners as he does his best to keep from grinning and only partially succeeds. Yuuri smiles back, and it\u2019s only been a little over a week, but he seems less tense, almost \u2013 happier, even, and Phichit doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s due to Yurio or Viktor or some combination of the two but he\u2019s thrilled to see it. He misses Yuuri, but the longer he\u2019s away the more Phichit becomes convinced that it was the right decision.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, dress me then,\u201d Yuuri says, flinging his arms out dramatically, and Yurio breaks and laughs outright. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me leave the house in something you didn\u2019t approve of anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio walks to the other side of the room and flings open the closet, \u201cI\u2019d say you have a terrible sense of style, but that implies you have one at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri makes an offended face at the camera, but doesn\u2019t protest Yurio\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he taking you?\u201d Yurio asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes, \u201cOkay, well what are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shrugs, \u201cNo clue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio pulls his head out of the closet and demands, \u201cHow the hell does that asshole expect you to dress then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri holds up both his hands in helpless confusion, and Phichit leaves the camera\u2019s view so they can hear him laughing but at least they can\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor knows it\u2019s not a real date, that Yuuri only agreed because they have a cover to maintain, but it\u2019s the closest he\u2019s gotten, and he spends approximately ten minutes fiddling with his hair and triple checking that his waist coat is buttoned properly before he can talk himself into getting out of the car.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to knock on the door when it opens, Yura on the other side and scowling. He lowers his arm, confused. \u201cHi Yura. Can I come in? Is Yuuri ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of letting him in, Yura steps outside and closes the door behind him. He begins to feel a whole new type of nervousness when Yura crosses his arms, eyed hard, and says, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do?\u201d he asks, because he doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s good someone does.</p>\n<p>Yura growls, \u201cDon\u2019t act stupid.\u201d He\u2019s flattered Yura thinks it\u2019s an act. \u201cI see how you look at him. For the record, Katsudon is about the only one that hasn\u2019t figured out that you\u2019re a huge pervert.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a pervert,\u201d he protests, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite natural to think that \u2013 that I\u2019ve fallen \u2013 I mean, <em>look</em> at him Yura!\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t give an inch. \u201cWhatever. The point is that he has enough to worry about, with France and then the Grand Prix Final, that he doesn\u2019t need you messing with him just because you\u2019re easily distracted and he\u2019s pretty. Understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor feels the first stirrings of actual offence, because he\u2019s not <em>messing with him</em>, if anyone\u2019s messing with anyone, it\u2019s definitely Yuuri with him, since Yuuri\u2019s the one that danced with him and kissed him and made Viktor fall head over heels for him and then never bothered to call. Or text. Or email. But that\u2019s a lot of things that he doesn\u2019t want to say to Yura at all, so he goes, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me be crystal clear,\u201d Yura glares, \u201cNo using Yuuri trying to protect <em>me</em> as a way to get him to have sex with <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He jabs his finger into his chest for emphasis, and the Viktor winces and fights the urge to recoil. That\u2019s going to bruise. He opens his mouth, floundering for a moment before saying, \u201cI\u2019m very uncomfortable right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura smiles, and it looks almost like a snarl. \u201c<em>Good</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor swallows.</p>\n<p>He opens the door, kicking it open almost like a challenge. \u201cKatsudon\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you?\u201d he steps inside, edging around Yura in a way that would probably be funny if he wasn\u2019t genuinely worried for his safety. It\u2019s officially the strangest and most terrifying shovel talk he\u2019s ever been given, never mind that it\u2019s the only shovel talk he\u2019s ever been given.</p>\n<p>He pushes it all out of his mind as he walks to the Plisetsky\u2019s guest room. No matter anything else, he has a <em>date</em> with Yuuri.</p>\n<p>He tries to tone down his smile and keep his heart from beating a thousand times a minute, and fails spectacularly on both accounts.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is still messing with his hair when he hears someone clear their throat. He turns to the sound, and instantly feels all the blood rush to his face, which is at least better than it rushing to some other unfortunate places.</p>\n<p>Viktor is dressed in charcoal pants that cling to him and a matching waistcoat with a sky blue button up shirt underneath. His hair is falling into his face like it always does, and his cheeks are red, probably from coming in from the cold. His lips are a wet, dark pink that Yuuri wonders if he could get even darker if he bit them. He looks at Viktor and feels such a visceral punch of <em>want</em> in his gut that he\u2019s almost dizzy with it. \u201cI feel underdressed,\u201d he says, and hopes Viktor doesn\u2019t notice how his voice cracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Viktor assures, his words almost overlapping with his own. Yuuri\u2019s wearing the same dark skinny jeans he wore to the airport, and a soft red cashmere sweater that Yura has bullied him into wearing. Mostly because it\u2019s not his sweater \u2013 it\u2019s Yura\u2019s, and it shows. It\u2019s wrapped around him like a second skin, and the neck dips down low enough to show his collarbones. He knows it\u2019s ridiculous to feel naked when he\u2019s almost entirely covered, but he does. He can\u2019t help it. He doesn\u2019t usually wear clothing this form fitting unless he\u2019s skating in a competition.</p>\n<p>He swallows, \u201cUh, okay. Should \u2013 should we get going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor blinks then jerks, like he\u2019s coming out of a trance. \u201cYes! Yes, let\u2019s go.\u201d He offers his arm, and Yuuri can\u2019t help but feel oddly shy as he places his hand in the crook of Viktor\u2019s elbow, and he can\u2019t even say <em>why</em>. He\u2019s never dated anyone, but he\u2019s been on dates. This is no different. This is fine.</p>\n<p>They walk out and Yura is curled up in the corner of the couch, scrolling through his phone. He looks up at they walk by and smiles at him, \u201cDon\u2019t forget your coat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, and resists the urge to reach out and ruffle his hair, knowing that Yura won\u2019t appreciate it, at least not in front of Viktor. Then he has a small panic attack when Viktor grabs his coat off the hook and helps him into it. He snatches Viktor\u2019s from the rack before he can, and stubbornly hold it out so he can return the favor.</p>\n<p>He just knows Yura is making a face behind them, so he waves goodbye and shoves them both out the door before he can comment.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until Viktor has turned the key and his car revs to life that he realizes he\u2019s made a terrible mistake. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says softly, eyes widening as he grips the steering wheel too tight. He slowly curls forward and presses his head against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor!\u201d Yuuri grabs his shoulder, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns his head until he can peek at Yuuri\u2019s worried face and admits, \u201cI forgot to plan something. I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t think of anything for us to do.\u201d He\u2019d been so excited about going on a date with Yuuri and trying to pick out the perfect outfit and trying not to be late that he\u2019d completely forgotten that in order for them to go on a date he had to actually <em>plan a date</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never telling Chris about this.</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares. He wonders if he\u2019s just going to get out of the car and go back inside and leave Viktor out here alone to call himself ten kinds of idiot. \u201cIs that all?\u201d he asks finally, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. What do you normally do when you want to get noticed by paparazzi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShopping?\u201d he answers, because he\u2019s careful to be photographed pretty frequently, the more pictures of him that show up in magazines the more he can charge for exhibition skates. Besides, even the trashy tabloids are usually pretty kind to him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pats his shoulder and leans back in his seat, grinning. \u201cOkay, well I don\u2019t really have the money to buy much, but I like window shopping. Maybe I\u2019ll find some gifts for my parents for Christmas or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor kind of wants to kiss Yuuri right now. Well, he always kind of wants to kiss him, but \u2013 he\u2019s not making fun of him, he\u2019s not upset or irritated. He\u2019s just sitting in his car, waiting for him to drive them to the mall so they can window shop. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says as Viktor backs them out of Yura\u2019s driveway, \u201cI\u2019m easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nearly hits the mailbox pulling onto the road. Is Yuuri trying to kill him?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri finally closes the app, his plane ticket bought, and some of the worried tension leaves. For better or worse, he\u2019s made his decision.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but the house feels kind of empty without Katsudon or his grandfather in it. Visiting hours are over at the hospital, and the rink is closed. He could break in, he\u2019s done it before, but he really doesn\u2019t want either Katsudon or Yakov to get a call from the cops if he gets caught.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already half made up his mind to go for a run around his block just to get rid of some of his restless energy when there\u2019s a knock at the door. He\u2019s instantly suspicious \u2013 anyone who he\u2019d open the door for has their own keys. Whoever it is knocks again, and he heaves himself off the couch. He stands on his tiptoes so he can squint through the peephole, then bangs his head against the door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Mila and Georgi. He debates not answering, but they definitely know he\u2019s there and they do have their own keys, so if he doesn\u2019t let them in they <em>will</em> let themselves in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens the door scowling, \u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to see you too,\u201d Mila says as Georgi pushes his way past Yuri, his arms laden with take-out. \u201cGame night!\u201d She hold up her hands, and Yuri notices she\u2019s holding a small stack of board games.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he snarls, then the smell of the food Georgi is unpacking on his coffee table hits him. \u201cIs that from Suliko?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour favorite,\u201d Georgi winks, \u201cNow are you going to stand their pouting, or are you going to get some plates?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wavers. Mila is holding Monopoly. He <em>loves</em> Monopoly, and they don\u2019t. They never agree to play it with him.</p>\n<p>Even as annoying as Georgi and Mila are, a night spent eating and playing with them is probably better than spending the night home alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he rolls his eyes, but goes to the kitchen to get some plates. He pretends he doesn\u2019t see them high five as soon as his back is turned.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>They\u2019re being trailed by a few very unsubtle paparazzi, but they\u2019ve stayed a respectful distance away. They also keep getting stopped by fans wanting selfies, and almost all of them recognized Yuuri as well and wanted a photo with him too. He supposes if nothing else pretending to date Viktor might up his popularity and make him more appealing to sponsors.</p>\n<p>He buys a delicate nesting doll in varying shades of green for his mother, and then a similar one in pink for Minako. Viktor had insisted on carrying them, then dragged him into a high end menswear store, and started piling things into his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I be insulted that everyone in my life feels the need to dress me?\u201d Yuuri asks, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Viktor says, critically eyeing two shirts that to Yuuri look like the exact same shade of aquamarine. \u201cWell, maybe a little. You spend too much time in sweatpants and t-shirts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI spend most of my time training or studying,\u201d he points out, and he\u2019s definitely had this conversation with Phichit before.</p>\n<p>Viktor puts one of the shirts back on the rack. Yuuri can\u2019t tell which one. \u201cIt\u2019s practically <em>criminal</em> not to dress your body up. It\u2019s your body, it\u2019s meant to be decorated. Like your home!\u201d</p>\n<p>The only decorating he\u2019s ever done was hanging up an obsessive number of posters and photos of Viktor. Which is a horrible thought to have, because that leads to him thinking of decorating his <em>body</em> with Viktor, and thank god Viktor has his head buried in a rack of slacks because his entire face is burning.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere!\u201d he dramatically holds up a pair of dark red pants, \u201cPerfect!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri hopes he doesn\u2019t expect him to wear that with aquamarine shirt. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t afford any of this right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDress up is fun,\u201d he pouts, \u201cWon\u2019t you try them on for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>All this blood rushing to his face so often can\u2019t be healthy. \u201cY-yeah. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>This entire thing is incredibly self-indulgent, and also probably morally questionable, but Viktor is having the time of his life. Yuuri lets him shove him into a dressing room and call out instructions about what to pair together.</p>\n<p>He chose a few things that he wasn\u2019t sure about, so he\u2019s sure at least some of the outfits are going to look silly. Not that he\u2019ll <em>tell</em> Yuuri that, but some of them inevitably aren\u2019t going to look great because that\u2019s how clothes and people who wear clothes work.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a fucking idiot.</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks absolutely delicious in everything.</p>\n<p>At first he thinks he\u2019s not just looking at him objectively, since he\u2019s certain Yuuri could be wearing a potato sack and Viktor would still want to lick his face. But considering the downright filthy glances the store attendant keeps giving his date, he figures he\u2019s not alone in his assessment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look ridiculous,\u201d Yuuri complains, and Viktor looks up from his phone to assure him he doesn\u2019t, but he gets one look at Yuuri and nearly swallows his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he starts, and can\u2019t finish, because he\u2019s forgotten how to speak Russian, never mind English.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pushes his hair back, rolling his eyes. The store attendant walks into the rack of clothes, and scrambles to keep it from crashing to the ground. Viktor can\u2019t blame him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wear this on the <em>ice</em>, forget the street. I look like a Christmas ornament!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can be the star on top of my tree,\u201d the attendant mutters in Russian, clearly not meaning to be heard. Viktor would tell him that doesn\u2019t even make sense, except the man is managing to actually form words, so he\u2019s doing better than Viktor.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s wearing the slim dark red pants, clinging perfectly to the curve of his ass and making his long legs look even longer. Then it\u2019s a simple black t-shirt, but on top of that is a black silk-wool blend blazer with a floral pattern embroidered in gold thread. It hugs him perfectly, and clothes off the rack don\u2019t fit anyone perfectly, except Yuuri Katsuki, apparently. It emphasizes his slim waist and broadens his shoulders, makes the eye focus on the swell of his muscles as he breathes and the gold thread shimmers with every shifting movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need that,\u201d he croaks out finally, his mouth dry.</p>\n<p>Yuuri huffs and crosses his arms. Viktor thinks he might whimper. \u201cThese are way too expensive \u2013 I definitely can\u2019t afford any of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need it,\u201d he repeats dumbly, and when Yuuri\u2019s eyes narrow in the beginnings of true irritation he adds on, \u201cI\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes, \u201cViktor, no! You don\u2019t need to do that. I look silly, I don\u2019t need any of this stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a gift for Yuuri, it\u2019s a gift for himself because he\u2019s a bad, bad man. \u201cI insist.\u201d Yuuri opens his mouth, hands on his hips, and Viktor interrupts him before he gets a chance to say anything, \u201cYou can argue with me now, and I\u2019ll smile and agree, and then I\u2019ll come back and buy it and drop it off at Yura\u2019s. Or you can say \u2018Thank you Viktor\u2019 and let me buy it now to save myself a trip tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri is unamused. Usually a faintly disapproving look from him is all Viktor needs to question his actions, but he\u2019s made up his mind. Yuuri looks <em>fabulous</em> in it in a way that Viktor could never pull off. For all of his shyness, Yuuri does \u2018flashy\u2019 so much better than him. Whenever he tries to wear something with sparkle he looks like a disco reject. Yuuri looks like a work of art.</p>\n<p>Granted, he <em>always </em>looks like a work of art, but still.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Viktor,\u201d he says finally, uncrossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d he says generously.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re leaving the store, Viktor having insisted, on carrying their bags, and Yuuri\u2019s hand tucked into the small of his elbow when his stomach grows. Viktor kind of wants to die, but Yuuri just laughs, \u201cDinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he smiles down at him, and sees a camera flash out of the corner of his eye. \u201cFrench?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri jerks his head to the paparazzi, \u201cDo you think we\u2019ve put on enough of a show?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s heart sinks. He doesn\u2019t want this date to end, but it would be unfair to lie just to spend more time with him. \u201cI think they\u2019ve gotten plenty of photos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yuuri says, \u201cbecause I owe you some katsudon. Let\u2019s go the market to get the ingredients, and I\u2019ll make it for you. Do you mind if we go to your place? I don\u2019t want to wake up Yura.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is the best day of his life. He hopes he doesn\u2019t look too much like a besotted idiot, but considering the rapid flashes of cameras going off he must fail completely. \u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mila\u2019s eye flick to the clock. It\u2019s late, and Yuuri still isn\u2019t home.</p>\n<p>Yura is grinning with devilish delight while Georgi looks at what remains of his properties and openly weeps.</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s not the first night they\u2019ve spent on Yura\u2019s couch, and she doubts it\u2019ll be the last. Besides, they figured this might happen, and there\u2019s a bag in her car with overnight things for both of them, plus their practice outfits for the next morning. Not that they\u2019ll tell Yura they were planning to stay over \u2013 he\u2019ll only get offended and insist he doesn\u2019t need to be babysat.</p>\n<p>She looks down at her own holdings and tries to keep her shoulders from slumping. She\u2019s <em>good </em>at Monopoly, but she\u2019s almost as bad off as Georgi.</p>\n<p>Yura is a monster.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>This is hands down the best date Yuuri has ever been on, and it\u2019s not even a real date. He can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s sad or pathetic, so he just focuses on cooking. Viktor pours them each some wine, and on one hand he doesn\u2019t usually drink alcohol so close to a competition, but on the other hand Viktor simultaneously makes him feel safe and comfortable and nervous enough to crawl out of his skin all at once, so he decides a glass or two won\u2019t hurt. Besides, it takes roughly a dozen shots of hard liquor to get him to tipsy, so some wine won\u2019t do much.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mother taught you this?\u201d Viktor asks, sitting on the section of the counter that Yuuri hasn\u2019t commandeered.</p>\n<p>He nods, \u201cI\u2019ve been helping out in the hot springs since I was a kid. My older sister, Mari, was awful at cooking. I mean, she still is, but she can do simple stuff now. I picked it up pretty quick, so if I wasn\u2019t in school or on the ice, I was in the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSchool,\u201d Viktor says, and he sounds upset. Yuuri looks up at him, confused. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am in school,\u201d he says slowly, feeling as if he\u2019s missed something here.</p>\n<p>Viktor shakes his head, \u201cNo, I mean, right now. Like \u2013 <em>right now</em>. It\u2019s the middle of the semester!\u201d</p>\n<p>H looks so worried that Yuuri knows it\u2019d be rude to laugh at him, but he almost does it anyway. \u201cViktor, it\u2019s competition season. I don\u2019t take classes in the fall, only in the spring and summer. Otherwise I\u2019d probably give myself a heart attack from stress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d now he looks embarrassed, and the flush across his face makes Yuuri want to kiss his nose. \u201cRight. That makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nudges Viktor\u2019s knees with his hip, \u201cIt\u2019s about done, do you want to grab some bowls?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hops down and does just that. \u201cIt smells great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I hope it tastes that way,\u201d he says, accepting the bowl from Viktor and trying not to grin too wide when their fingers brush.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor automatically goes to his couch before remembering he\u2019s not alone and he has a kitchen table that they can use. He doesn\u2019t sit their normally, because eating a meal at a table meant for four when he\u2019s alone just makes him feel \u2013 well, alone. He shifts to stand and sit at the table like a proper adult, but before he gets the chance Yuuri sits beside him, \u201cDid you want to watch a movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dinner and a movie, in his house, away from the reporters and everyone else. It\u2019s almost like a real date. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, mouth dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he says, \u201cyou pick. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be able to understand any of it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll translate,\u201d he promises, tossing Yuuri the remote.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe channels are in Cyrillic,\u201d he protests, \u201cI can\u2019t read this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor laughs at him, and keeps at it until he takes his first bite of katsudon. He goes still and his eyes widen.</p>\n<p>Yuuri leans forward, concerned. \u201cIs something wrong with it? If you don\u2019t like it\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, and swallows. \u201cThis,\u201d he says reverently, \u201cis the best thing I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri grins, \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he takes another bite and looks at his bowl in disbelief that anything can taste this delicious, \u201cthis is the <em>best thing I\u2019ve ever had in my mouth</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He only realizes what he\u2019s said after he\u2019s done it, but luckily Yuuri is just laughing at him, a pleased little crinkle at the corner of his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s recipe. I\u2019ll be sure to tell her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor hopes he doesn\u2019t phrase it exactly like he had, but can\u2019t be too bothered either way. Yuuri is in his home, having made him delicious food, and is sitting on his couch with him, content as Viktor flicks through the on-demand section for something worth watching and hopefully in English.</p>\n<p>Halfway through the movie, Yuuri falls asleep and his head droops down to rest on Viktor\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Viktor can\u2019t remember the last time he was happier than he is right now.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri\u2019s alarm goes off the next morning, and when he wakes up he remembers the night of good food and absolutely destroying his rinkmates at Monopoly, and has to spend a good minute grinning into his pillow like a little kid.</p>\n<p>He gets himself under control, and decides he\u2019ll even make coffee for everyone before they have to head off to practice. He likes the caffeine, but can only tolerate it with a frankly disgusting amount of sugar. Katsudon and Georgi are the same, while Mila drinks it black like her soul.</p>\n<p>All his good cheer disappears instantly when he passes by Katsudon\u2019s room to see his door open and no one inside, the bed made and unused.</p>\n<p>He stares at it in betrayal. \u201cViktor,\u201d he growls viciously, \u201c<em>you slutty motherfucker</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mila is, at first, incredibly irritated at Yura for waking her up by pushing her off the couch onto the ground. Then he shoves a heavenly smelling coffee into her hand and says \u201cKatsudon didn\u2019t come home last night. Drive me to Viktor\u2019s so we can pick them up before practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura doesn\u2019t end that sentence with <em>so I can roundhouse kick Viktor in the face</em>, but considering the force of his scowl it\u2019s definitely implied. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says. She reaches up to the armchair that Georgi is sleeping in, grabs onto his ankle, and yanks him down to the floor with her.</p>\n<p>He wakes up screaming, realizes where he is, and curls up on the carpet and falls back asleep immediately.</p>\n<p>Yura stares. \u201cIs he always like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince we were kids,\u201d she says with more fondness than she\u2019d be comfortable showing if he was awake enough to hear her.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, looking between them oddly. \u201cI\u2019m going to get changed. Let me know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a minimal amount of affronted whining from Georgi, they\u2019re on the road a short while later. Yura sits with his arms crossed the whole time, staring out the window like the route from his to Viktor\u2019s home isn\u2019t one he\u2019s traveled a hundred times before. He\u2019s out of the car almost before Mila has had a chance to park, and then he\u2019s taking the stairs two at a time up to Viktor\u2019s floor. She\u2019s not willing to miss a second of this, so she\u2019s right behind him. Georgi follows at a more sedate pace, his innate need for drama battling with his overwhelming hatred of waking up and coming out the loser.</p>\n<p>Yura unlocks the door and slams it open, \u201cVIKTOR!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a thump and twin grunts of pain. They both turn to the source of it, and see Viktor and Yuri splayed out on the floor and blinking sleepily, both having fallen from the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad we\u2019re all starting today the same way,\u201d Mila says, and can\u2019t help but be disappointed in their appearance. They\u2019d clearly fallen asleep in their clothes \u2013 actually, is Yuuri wearing Yura\u2019s sweater? \u2013 and Yuuri has indent makes on his right cheek from sleeping in his glasses.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t look like they got up to anything interesting last night.</p>\n<p>Yura must notice the same thing, because his shoulders relax and most of his angry energy bleeds off of him. \u201cKatsudon. You didn\u2019t come home last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri and Viktor stand up from off the floor, and Yuuri\u2019s whole demeanor is contrite. \u201cSorry, Yurokchka. We were watching a movie and must have fallen asleep. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he shrugs, but the last of the tension leaves his frame when Yuuri steps from Viktor\u2019s side over to his, and he smiles up at Yuuri seemingly in spite of himself. \u201cYou\u2019re late for practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re all late for practice, actually,\u201d Georgi says, leaning against the doorframe.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good point. Mila considers sending Yakov a text, but decides against it. He\u2019s too high strung. It\u2019ll be good for him. She\u2019s only looking out for his long term health, really. He\u2019s so lucky to have such caring and considerate students.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s face drains of color. Viktor just keeps fiddling with the edges of his wrinkled shirt and trying not to look at anyone. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he says, \u201coh no, okay, this is fine. I just need to swing by Yura\u2019s to get my things\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI grabbed your skates,\u201d Georgi volunteers, then scratches his chin. \u201cHadn\u2019t considered that you might need anything else. Sorry Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can borrow something to wear from me,\u201d Viktor volunteers instantly.</p>\n<p>Yura scowls. Mila doesn\u2019t laugh, but it\u2019s a near thing. Viktor probably thinks he\u2019s slick, but it\u2019s obvious to anyone with eyes that what he wants more than anything is to see Yuuri in his clothes. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she says, \u201canything you have would be too big. I have an extra set of practice clothes I keep at the rink he can borrow. Now go get ready so we can leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor slinks away, trying to hide that he\u2019s pouting and failing miserably. Yura pokes Yuuri in the side, \u201cCan we work on my transitions today? I was watching my practice video and they\u2019re still not smooth enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on yourself,\u201d he says, which isn\u2019t wrong, Mila thinks, but is rich coming from him. \u201cBut yeah, of course. Whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura positively beams, and it\u2019s so strange to see him looking and acting his age. He only does it around Yuuri. Mila finds it adorable, but knows if she ever said that aloud Yura would flip.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady!\u201d Viktor calls, stepping out in his standard sweatpants and t-shirt. He flashes his million watt grin at Yuuri, who turns red and scratches his nose in an attempt to hide it. Yura is back to scowling.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s so happy Yuuri came to stay with them. This is the most fun she\u2019s had possibly ever.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris thinks he\u2019s a good person. Not perfect, of course, but kind enough, a decent sort of guy. Not cruel or particularly malicious. Arrogant for sure, but he\u2019s <em>earned </em>it, so it\u2019s hard for him to think of it as a vice. Which is probably why it is one, actually.</p>\n<p>So as he stares at the ringing phone his coach is holding out to him, he can\u2019t think of what he could have done to deserve this hell. Surely his past self was some sort of serial killer or tax evader or someone who was rude to waiters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Josef asks impatiently, shaking the phone. \u201cAre you going to answer it?\u201d</p>\n<p>For his sins, whatever they may be, he is the receptacle for all of Viktor Nikiforov\u2019s many and varied emotions. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes the phone and answers it, preemptively pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off the headache he\u2019s sure will come. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re calling to say you finally banged Yuuri? I saw the photos of your fake date last night. He looked good enough to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor tries to sputter in indignation and sigh dreamily at the same time, and it ends up coming out as a garbled gasp. Chris <em>must</em> have been someone who double parked in a past life. It\u2019s the only explanation. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>No shit</em>, Chris wants to say, but doesn\u2019t, because he\u2019s a good person, damnit. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t sleep together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe technically slept together? We fell asleep on my couch last night,\u201d and there\u2019s that dreamy sigh again. Chris wants to stab himself in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor, for the love of god, <em>make a real move</em>. Put us all out of our misery. Throw him over your shoulder and take him to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor makes a sound of scandalized affront at the suggestion, like Chris doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s almost certainly jerked off to that very thought. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s actually interested in me, yo-\u201c</p>\n<p>Chris hangs up and would throw his phone onto the rink in frustration if he didn\u2019t have to pay for it\u2019s replacement. It\u2019s almost worth it regardless, but only almost. \u201cI\u2019m a good person, right?\u201d he asks his coach.</p>\n<p>Josef\u2019s eyes flicker to the side, halfway to an eyeroll he won\u2019t let himself complete, which is about the maximum amount of expression he shows in any of Chris\u2019s personal affairs. \u201cYou\u2019re a good <em>skater</em>, although that won\u2019t last if you don\u2019t get back to practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>A serial killing, tax evading person who was mean to waiters and double parked. It\u2019s the <em>only</em> reasonable explanation.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Georgi is pretty comfortable in the knowledge that\u2019s he\u2019s a straight guy. He likes girls. Probably too much, falling in love too fast and too hard with the idea of a woman rather than the woman herself. Hey, he\u2019s self aware, if not willing to actually do anything about it. The high before the fall is far too exhilarating to give up.</p>\n<p>Point being, he is a man who is attracted to women.</p>\n<p>But even he has to do a double take when Yuuri steps onto the ice. Because Georgi may be straight, but he is an appreciator of <em>beauty</em>, and Yuuri\u2019s ass in Mila\u2019s leggings can hardly qualify as anything else. They\u2019re skintight, molding to his every muscle, and Mila\u2019s crop top almost looks better on Yuuri than it does on her, although Georgi will never tell her that. Then again, judging by the appreciative way she\u2019s eyeing Yuuri, he thinks she might agree with him.</p>\n<p>Viktor is staring, bug-eyed and mouth open. He skates straight into the edge of the rink, and then has to flail to grab onto it to keep on falling over. Yura can\u2019t seem to decide between being amused or irritated. Yakov looks like he regrets ever getting involved with figure skating in general, and agreeing to coach any of them in particular. He looks like that a lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get cold in this?\u201d Yuuri asks, ineffectually trying to tug the top lower so that the majority of his torso isn\u2019t on display.</p>\n<p>Georgi thinks Viktor actually whimpers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re cold, then you\u2019re not training hard enough,\u201d she says decisively, then claps her hands together, \u201cChop, chop!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes and goes to the middle of ice, Yura trailing behind him. Viktor still looks like he\u2019s in the middle of having a heart attack.</p>\n<p>Georgi skates behind Mila and stoops so he can rest his chin on her shoulder. \u201cYou are a very bad woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have always known this,\u201d she leans her head against his for the briefest of moments before darting away and leaving him scrambling not to fall flat on his face.</p>\n<p>Well, she\u2019s not wrong.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the night before he has to leave for Paris, and he and Yura are waiting outside for their cab after a visit with Yura\u2019s grandfather. It\u2019s snowing, and Yura is tucked under his arm and up against his side for warmth. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Yura asks.</p>\n<p>He blinks, looking down. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says, and is surprised by the honesty of it. He has the worst nerves right before he steps onto the ice, but two days before a competition he\u2019s usually gotten to the point where he\u2019s jittery, and pacing, and he can\u2019t focus on anything. But instead he\u2019s trying to think of what to make for dinner, and if he should double the recipe so Yura doesn\u2019t just eat take out with his rinkmates while he\u2019s gone, and replaying every time Viktor has smiled at him in the past week and wondering if he places in France if Viktor will smile at him when he gets back.</p>\n<p>He knows it\u2019ll just be for show if he does, but he wonders if Viktor will be waiting for him at the airport when he comes back, just like Yuuri was for him. He spends an awful lot of time wondering about that one, actually.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not calm. He\u2019ll never be anxiety free, but this is as close to stable ground as he\u2019s known since he was a kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yura says, satisfied, and snuggles even more into Yuuri.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichuit\u2019s worried face fills the screen of his laptop, but Yuuri can\u2019t bring himself to feel more than a light undercurrent of anxiety \u2013 well, about this one specific thing, at least. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he\u2019s planning to do,\u201d his friend says, and he sounds agonized about it.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head, surveying the things he has laid out on his bed, triple checking that he has everything he needs for France. He has to leave to catch his flight in a few hours. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I knew that this might happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just <em>talk</em> to him,\u201d Phichit tries, \u201che may be a loud drunk, but he\u2019s a good coach, and he cares about you. But you just left, and didn\u2019t tell him why\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him it was a family emergency, and I told him to trust me,\u201d he says, turning back to the camera to raise an eyebrow. At Phichit\u2019s disapproving look, he sighs and admits, \u201cI\u2019ve tried calling a couple of times, but he won\u2019t answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit moans in despair and buries his face in his hands. Yuri can\u2019t help but crack a grin. He knows this is serious, he knows that he should be panicking and worrying about the fact he may be performing at the Trophee Eric Bombard without a coach, and he is worried, there\u2019s a pit of unease in his stomach. But, even if that\u2019s the case \u2013 well, he knows it won\u2019t be a disaster.</p>\n<p>He feels more comfortable with his routine than he ever has. Worst case scenario, he\u2019s almost certain that he can get Yura to convince Yakov to act as his coach for the rest of the season. Besides, Nikolai has another back surgery scheduled. It looks like he\u2019ll make a complete recovery from all of this, but a large chunk of that is that he\u2019s not rushing to get out of the hospital to take care of his grandson. Because he doesn\u2019t have to, since Yuuri is here to make sure that Yura doesn\u2019t stress himself into an early grave.</p>\n<p>So coach or no coach, he\u2019s staying right where he is. He\u2019s made up his mind, and he knows he\u2019s making the right choice.</p>\n<p>Yuuri had forgotten how determined he could be, how clear everything was for him once he decided exactly what it was that he wanted. This has all been a very good reminder.</p>\n<p>When he looks back at the screen, Phichit is peeking at him through his fingers and smiling. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just \u2013 you look really happy, Yuuri. Maybe Russia is good for you.\u201d He lowers his hands and his soft expression melts into a wicked smirk. \u201cOr at lease <em>something</em> in Russia is good for you. To you. <em>In</em> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri slams his laptop shut, face burning.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri had already told his grandfather and Yakov was he was planning on doing. However, he remembers he deliberately hadn\u2019t told the most important person when Katsudon comes out of his room with his suitcase, sees Yuri waiting for him with his duffle swung over his shoulder, and only looks confused. \u201cYurochka?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe better hurry up if we don\u2019t want to miss our flight,\u201d he says, \u201cYou take forever to pack, we\u2019re going to be there for like four days, what could you possibly be bringing?\u201d He frowns, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re spending too much time around Viktor. He always overpacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon\u2019s mouth drops open, then he closes it. \u201cYura, what are you talking about? You can\u2019t come with me, you\u2019re in the middle of training, and the last thing you need is to interrupt that worrying about me\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d he crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow. \u201cKatsudon, you dropped everything and flew across the country to stay with me when I needed you. You left your coach behind, you friends, everything you know to move to a place where you don\u2019t even speak the language. You did it even though you\u2019re in the middle of competition season.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubs the back of his neck, \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri scowls and marches forward to jab Katsudon in the chest. \u201cIt is <em>not</em>. This friendship is a two way street, and if you think I\u2019m going to let you go to France and compete alone you\u2019ve lost your mind. You\u2019re my friend. You won\u2019t leave me to face my problems alone, and I won\u2019t leave you to face yours alone either.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has his plane ticket, and he booked a hotel room, there\u2019s absolutely nothing Katsudon can do to stop him. He\u2019s one hundred percent prepared to be supportive against Katsudon\u2019s will, but instead Katsudon pulls him forward and gives him a crushing hug. \u201cThanks,\u201d he breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is what friends are for,\u201d he says confidently, hugging back and burying his face in Katsudon\u2019s shoulder to hide how terribly relieved he is that he\u2019d made the right call.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The flight is short, or at least shorter than it would have been from Detroit, and he\u2019s almost not exhausted from sitting in a plane doing nothing. He\u2019s thankful they both just brought carry-ons so they don\u2019t have to wait in baggage claim.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri! Over here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Both he and Yura turn to the sound of the voice, and he breaks out into a big grin and drops his bag so he can run to meet her. \u201cSara!\u201d He picks her up and spins her, lifting her by her ass just to piss Michele off. When he puts her back on her feet, she gives him a quick hug and a kiss on each cheek. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I didn\u2019t order a welcome committee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not very welcome,\u201d Michele hisses, angrily taking the bags from Yura\u2019s hands. Even when he\u2019s furious he still has to act like a gentleman. It\u2019s one of the things Yuuri likes best about him. \u201cStop touching my sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks down at Sara, who\u2019s still attached to his arm. \u201cDo you want me to stop touching you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she beams, and Michele sighs.</p>\n<p>Yuuri tugs Yura forward with his free hand, and tries not to notice how tense and uncertain he\u2019s become. \u201cYura, these are my friends, Sara and Michele Crispino,\u201d Michele huffs at being called his friend, but only holds Yura\u2019s duffle a little firmer. \u201cGuys, this is Yuri Plisetsky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know!\u201d Sara says, \u201cI can\u2019t wait until you start competing at the senior level, it\u2019s going to be glorious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d Michele says, his scowl slipping off his face when he addresses Yura, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy good, I\u2019m going to lose my place on the podium once I start skating against you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura looks stunned, and he gets that pleased little smile on his face that he usually only has around Yuuri. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, how did you even know when I was arriving?\u201d Yuuri asks as they make their trek out of the airport.</p>\n<p>\u201cMila told me, she said she didn\u2019t want you getting lost,\u201d she grins.</p>\n<p>Yuuri rolls his eyes, \u201cI have been to Paris before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I remember,\u201d she says, and he hopes she doesn\u2019t go into detail because Yura is <em>right there</em>, and Chris hadn\u2019t been there that time to drag him out to the clubs, but Sara had been and it had been <em>brutal</em>. He\u2019d woken up with a massive hangover, half his clothes missing, and about a dozen different phone numbers written on his abs.</p>\n<p>Going out with Sara is even more dangerous than going out with Chris.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yakov has been unsuccessfully trying to get ahold of Celestino since Yuuri came to stay with Yura. He knows that if any of his students tried to pull that kind of shit on him he\u2019d be <em>furious</em>, so he does understand the man\u2019s radio silence, at least in part.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>Yuuri has enough raw talent to make Viktor weep (literally, the last time Yuuri had gone through his full routine Vitya had actually started crying) and he thinks that type of skill should afford Yuuri enough room to make some bad decisions. God knows Vitya makes enough of them.</p>\n<p>Considering his inability to confirm whether or not the boy\u2019s coach will even show up, he feels completely justified and booking his own ticket to Paris. Yura may be great for the boy\u2019s confidence, but he\u2019s not a coach. He doesn\u2019t <em>tell</em> anyone that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, he has a reputation damnit, so instead he just says that since Yura isn\u2019t going to be there they can all have the weekend off.</p>\n<p>Yakov is showing up the day the competition starts, so that he doesn\u2019t have to leave his other students alone for more than a couple days, considering it\u2019s in the middle of their competition season as well and Yuuri isn\u2019t technically his student.</p>\n<p>This ends up being a completely worthless effort.</p>\n<p>He shows up to the boarding area the same time as Mila and Georgi. They both look surprised to see him. \u201cWhat do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Georgi winces, \u201cwe thought it\u2019d be a good idea check out the competition in person?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila glares at him, \u201cNever mind us, what are <em>you</em> doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov scoffs and sputters, trying to come up with an explanation that isn\u2019t as sappy as the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIENDS!\u201d a voice they all know well crows, and all three of their shoulders slump. Viktor beams and walks over, dragging an unnecessarily large pink suitcase behind him. He throws an arm around Yakov and Georgi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhat are you all doing here? Are you coming to see me off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov,\u201d Georgi says, absolutely delighted, \u201cyou really have taken our little pork cutlet bowl under your wing, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Mila simpers, smirking like they\u2019re clearly aren\u2019t all here for the same reason, as if he\u2019s any more sappy or invested than the rest of them considering they all individually decided to fly to Paris and support Yuuri. \u201cHow uncharacteristically caring and sensitive of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov wants to die.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yura has the hotel room next to his, and he must have talked to Phichit to get his flight and room details. When he next talks to his best friend, he\u2019ll be sure to yell at him for not telling him. Then again, it\u2019s entirely possible he thought that Yuuri had known since it\u2019s not like Yura to keep secrets from him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d booked this room with Celestino before he\u2019d left Detroit. He\u2019s disappointed when he checks into an empty room, but not terribly surprised. Celestino will either show up, or he won\u2019t, and if he doesn\u2019t he and Yuuri will have to make a statement to the press saying they\u2019ve gone their separate ways. If they don\u2019t, the rumor mill and the few gossip rags that follow figure skating will go absolutely wild.</p>\n<p>This is, he decides, all a tomorrow problem. He\u2019s going to sleep now so he can wake up early enough to beat everyone to the rink tomorrow. Yura\u2019s still awake, but he trusts Sara and Michele not to get him into too much trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri had spent the whole night hanging out in a restaurant down the street from the hotel with the senior skaters, and at first he\u2019d been horribly self conscious and snappish, because he was obviously the youngest one there and he only knew <em>of</em> all these people, he didn\u2019t actually know any of them even if he\u2019d seen them with his rinkmates before.</p>\n<p>But Michele had stayed at his side the whole night, guiding him into conversation and cutting anyone off if they began to say something about his age or anything else. He\u2019d relaxed after that, and it had actually been really nice, what he imagines being a real senior skater will be like, what being appreciated for his skills will feel like, when people talk to him again and don\u2019t just shut him out and ignore him because of jealousy.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t really have any friends among the junior skaters. There\u2019s Phichit now, but they haven\u2019t competed at the same event since they become friends, and having another skater to text and joke with who was closer to his age was nice, but it wasn\u2019t the same as the easy camaraderie that other skaters seemed to share at competitions, going out together and sharing in-jokes and not letting rankings and loss get in the way of friendships.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d started skating because it was fun. Because it made him happy. He can\u2019t wait until he can share that part of him again with someone else besides Yuuri, and that night out with the senior skaters gives him a taste of that.</p>\n<p>This all means he\u2019s in a <em>fantastic</em> mood when he meets Yuuri down at the ice in the cool grey of morning, even if he\u2019s only running on a couple hours of sleep. He\u2019s not competing today, so he\u2019s not bothered, and Yuuri looks well rested. As he should, he\u2019d slept for more than ten hours. \u201cReady?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Yuuri beams at him and ruffles his hair. \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Celestino knows Yuuri. He wants to talk to him alone before just showing up in their hotel room so he figured waiting until his student was practicing was his best bet. When he shows up at the rink before most people have even contemplated being awake, he knows exactly what he\u2019ll find.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been coaching Yuuri for years, and he knew he was good. He wouldn\u2019t have kept training him if he wasn\u2019t. That said, he seems to have stalled out the past couple of years. Yuuri\u2019s mediocre is still leagues above most people\u2019s best, so even as he stagnated and got frustrated with his skills, he easily maintained his place as the best figure skater in Japan, he kept qualifying and usually even placing in the Grand Prix events. But Celestino had given up hope that Yuuri would ever break into something <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not a man who makes many mistakes. This was clearly one of them.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is performing his routine, smooth and elegant and looking more like he\u2019s flying than he\u2019s skating. There\u2019s no music that Celestino can hear, but he choreographed the piece, helped Yuuri place his step sequences. Even with the alterations, he can tell that Yuuri is perfectly synced to every beat of the song. Plisetsky is there, sweat soaked so he was skating earlier, but now he\u2019s only watching Yuuri in plain wonder as he dances on the ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d someone says, a warm hand clapping him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>Celestino raises an eyebrow and glances to his side to see Yakov. He quickly glances around the rink, but they\u2019re the only ones there, and mostly hidden away out of sight. \u201cIt seems your coaching has paid off,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Yakov snorts and shakes his head, \u201cWasn\u2019t me, I\u2019m afraid. I really didn\u2019t do much. That\u2019s all Yuuri. Well,\u201d he amends, \u201cYura helped.\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino rolls his eyes and looks back to Yuuri. \u201cI wanted to talk to him about what we should do going forward. But \u2013 damn, look at him. If he skates like this out there, there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t take gold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yakov agrees, \u201cwait until after the short skate, at least. Whatever you\u2019ve decided.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just me that has some decisions to make,\u201d he says, and he should go before he\u2019s noticed, but watching Yuuri perfectly execute jumps he\u2019d barely been able to land before is mesmerizing. \u201cWe both have to decide this is over.\u201d He looks behind him to his bag and slumps, \u201cAlso, if I\u2019m not letting him know I\u2019m here yet, then I can\u2019t go to our room. What do you think the chances are there\u2019s another room available?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone,\u201d he says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You can take Viktor\u2019s room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino raised an eyebrow, \u201cViktor\u2019s here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Yakov says with complete seriousness, \u201cthey are dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>He elbows him in the ribs, and takes some satisfaction from his hiss of pain. \u201cDon\u2019t try that crap with me. If Yuuri and Viktor were actually dating, he wouldn\u2019t have flown to Russia and paraded around in front of paparazzi. He\u2019d have hid his identity from the press until they were married, possibly until they died.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov rubs at his chest, \u201cWell, they might be dating, I can\u2019t keep up honestly. They spend so much time making cow eyes at each other who knows what they\u2019re doing. They certainly don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino coughs to mask his laughter, and they both have to duck behind the bleachers when Yura looks back to where they\u2019re hiding, confused. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before we get caught,\u201d Celestino mutters, grabbing Yakov by the shirt collar and dragging him out behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more calm than I anticipated,\u201d Yakov admits.</p>\n<p>Celestino stares, \u201cWhen am I ever <em>not</em> calm?\u201d The only time he was anything other than perfectly level was when he was drunk. Granted, he was drunk a lot, but even then he wasn\u2019t exactly prone to hysterics.</p>\n<p>Yakov rubs his chin, \u201cHuh. I guess you have a point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Celestino rolls his eyes, \u201clet\u2019s go kick the top figure skater in the world out of his room. Then you can buy me breakfast, since you stole my student.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal anyone,\u201d he sighs, \u201cbut sure. Viktor should have just fallen asleep, so waking him up should be extra satisfying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys just arrived?\u201d he asks, surprised.</p>\n<p>Yakov winces. \u201cActually, Yuuri doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re here yet either.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re away from the rink, because this time Celestino doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to contain his laughter even if he tried.</p>\n<p>Yakov still hasn\u2019t made an appearance by the time he has to step onto the ice for his short skate, and he should be freaking out. He should be an anxious <em>mess</em>.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s sure all the commentators are discussing it, and really should be more worried about it, but \u2013 he\u2019s just not. The only sound making it through right now is Yura cheering him on, and he focuses on that through the sounds of the audience and the commentators and everything else.</p>\n<p>The music swells, and he moves. He\u2019s done this routine so many times before, done it well so many times before. He knows he can do it, and as he moves he has a confidence in it that he\u2019s just never had before. It\u2019s not perfect, he wobbles on most of his landings and even has to touch down on one of them, but his transitions feel as fluid as ever. Before, each mistake would have built up on the one before, until he was too distracted by his potential point loss to give all his of his focus to the rest of the skate. Now there\u2019s a half-second of irritation, then he moves on, actually managing to get through the skate while remaining mostly calm.</p>\n<p>The minutes pass like seconds, and the next thing he knows the music has ended and he\u2019s gasping for breath, sweat dripping down his brow. Sound comes back to him all at once, and the stands are full of screaming fans and the commentators are actually stuttering they\u2019re so thrown off balance by his performance. He can only hope that\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p>He turns to skate off the rink, looking for Yura, but he has to pause for a moment at what he finds instead.</p>\n<p>Yura is there, of course, but he\u2019s not alone. Celestino is there, clapping and beaming, which is a nice surprise, but that\u2019s not all. Yakov is there, which he hadn\u2019t expected but almost makes sense, but Viktor is there too, and behind them are Georgi and Mila.</p>\n<p>There are too many cameras trained on him right now to hide that he\u2019s crying, so he doesn\u2019t even bother, wiping at his face as he skates over. \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was amazing!\u201d Yura beams. Viktor tries to move past him to get closer to Yuuri, and Yura elbows him in the stomach and pushes him back without looking. Viktor trips over his feet and crashes in Georgi. \u201cYou did so well, I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s not a touchy person, but Yura has conditioned him well, so he\u2019s already lifting an arm for a hug before he even moves to give him one. Yura\u2019s snuggled into his side with his arm around his waist when he looks at everyone and repeats, \u201cWhat are you all doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to support you, of course!\u201d Viktor calls out from where he\u2019s still trying to disentangle himself from the Georgi and get off the floor. Every time they almost make it to their feet, Mila pushes them back down again while laughing, so it\u2019s taking about five times longer than it should.</p>\n<p>Yakov shrugs and crosses his arms, but Yuuri thinks the old man might even be blushing. Celestino claps him on the shoulder and says, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get your scores. You did very well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri eyes his couch warily, but he doesn\u2019t <em>look</em> mad, and he\u2019s always been crap at hiding his emotions. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Phichit is literally on the edge of his seat, waiting for the judges to make their call. They don\u2019t have a television in their crappy shared apartment, so he\u2019s commandeered the one in the student lounge. Whenever someone had tried to change the channel, he thinks he might have hissed at them.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely the lounge has filled with people who don\u2019t particularly care about skating, but do care that one of their classmates is performing on international television. There are a few people here who Phichit would even say he and Yuuri are friends with, which is really sweet, and he means to take a selfie of everyone to send to his friend later, but right now he can\u2019t bring himself to look away from the screen for even a second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the scoreboard flashes <em>104.6</em> across the screen, he literally screams and starts jumping up and down on the couch. It takes everyone else a beat, because he\u2019s betting not a single one of them know how the scoring works, but as soon as they see how happy he is they start cheering as well.</p>\n<p>The photo he gets of everyone is a little blurry, but he\u2019s tackled by his science lab partner a moment later, so it\u2019s the best he\u2019s going to get.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Celestino knocks on the wall before walking the rest of the way into the changing room, just to make sure he doesn\u2019t startle his student. Yuuri is mostly changed, his uniform neatly folded on the bench as he pulls a sweater over his head. Celestino can tell he\u2019s still pretty dazed from his score, and Celestino doesn\u2019t blame him \u2013 that\u2019s the best short skate score he\u2019s ever received. \u201cThe rest of the competitors along with the Russians are waiting for you. They all want to go out to dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks, his dark eyes wide. \u201cOh. What? I don\u2019t normally go out with \u2013 with everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time your started,\u201d he says, raising an eyebrow, \u201cGiomatti and that Crispino girl always seem to get you in more trouble than anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d he says, more as a statement than as a defense. He\u2019s cautious, looking at him from the side of his eyes and pursing his lips. Celestino fully expected to have to be the one who brought up the elephant in the room, but maybe Phichit is right and these Russians are doing Yuuri some good, because he blurts out, \u201cDo you want to \u2013 should we \u2013 we should probably talk. About us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic, you make us sound like some sort of estranged lovers,\u201d he teases. Yuuri flushes and starts sputtering, and it\u2019s almost a relief, to see that the boy he\u2019s spent the past few years training hadn\u2019t disappeared in the weeks since he\u2019s seen him last. \u201cI was upset, and I still am, but I\u2019m old enough to admit that I acted poorly. I\u2019m okay with chalking this up to poor behavior on both our parts if you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri deflates, and he finally meets his eyes head on. \u201cYes! Please. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d he ruffles his hair, and is gratified when Yuuri leans into the touch. \u201cStill, you have some decisions to make. I\u2019m assuming you plan to go back to Russia, and not to Detroit with me?\u2019</p>\n<p>Yuuri hesitates, biting at his lower lip, but nods. Celestino had figured as much. Yakov had finally filled him in on what exactly Yuuri has been up to. He supposes if he\u2019d returned the other man\u2019s calls, or even Yuuri\u2019s, he would have found all this out a lot sooner.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, and his student blinks at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll remain silent to the press about what exactly is going on, and we\u2019ll all sit down and figure out what we\u2019re going to do. <em>After</em> the Grand Prix Final, which, after seeing you skate today, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll qualify for. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Some things definitely <em>have</em> changed, because shy, reserved Yuuri throws himself at him, giving him a quick, hard hug and whispering, \u201cThank you!\u201d before letting go, grabbing his uniform, and bolting out of the changing room.</p>\n<p>Celestino is left alone in the locker room, unable to do anything besides blink.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s new.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor had been hoping for a moment alone with Yuuri, but hadn\u2019t gotten one. He\u2019d come out of the locker room, and been immediately attacked by Sara Crispino, who had jumped into his arms and kissed both his cheeks in congratulations. He\u2019s never been so jealous of another person in his whole life. Also, seeing the ease that Yuuri catches Sara reminds him of how <em>strong</em> he is. Viktor is taller than him, but Yuuri probably could pick him up just as easily as he had Sara. Which is certainly an interesting thought, but one he shouldn\u2019t focus on too long while in public.</p>\n<p>Yura stays glued to Yuuri\u2019s side all through dinner, and Sara is draped over him on his other side. Mila sits next to Sara, and Viktor ends up almost across from Yuuri, sandwiched between Georgi and Michele, the latter of whom spends the whole dinner glaring at Yuuri. He\u2019s vaguely familiar with the other competing skaters, but he doesn\u2019t know them personally. He\u2019s pulled into their conversation anyway, it would be incredibly rude not to answer their questions when they\u2019re sharing a table, after all. He barely gets to exchange any words with Yuuri, never mind getting any alone time with them.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the dinner doesn\u2019t last long. The free skate is the next day, after all, so all the competing skaters are eager to get to bed early. Everyone finally disperses in the hotel lobby, Yura included, even if he does give Viktor a suspicious stare for not following him upstairs. Luckily, Michele pulls him away. Viktor makes a note to do something nice for the man later, even he does have some sort of weird vendetta against Yuuri.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Yuuri asks, and he\u2019s paused in the middle of the hallway, leaning back against the wall. \u201cYou\u2019ve been jumpy all night. Is something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought he\u2019d done a pretty good job of hiding it, but clearly not. Or maybe Yuuri just knows him that well. He really likes the idea of that. \u201cSo, um, I got a room here, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yuuri agrees, a smile around the edge of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Celestino took my room. Yakov woke me up and kicked me out, and Celestino gave me his key, so I kind of put my stuff in your room. Is it okay if I sleep there? I don\u2019t want to bother you or anything, you have a really important skate tomorrow, is all, and I can absolutely force Georgi and Mila to share with me, or Yura. Or I can get Yura to switch with me! You won\u2019t mind him, and he probably doesn\u2019t want me sleeping with you anyway \u2013 NEXT TO! He probably doesn\u2019t me sleeping next to you, is what I me\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri places his hand over Viktor\u2019s mouth, laughing as he cuts off his waterfall of words. \u201cYou can stay in my room Viktor, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve already shared a couch. We can share a room.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mind immediately goes back to that night, to Yuri heavy and warm at his side, and his voice comes out higher pitched than normal when he says, \u201cYeah, okay. Thank you.\u201d It also comes out a little muffled, since Yuuri\u2019s hand is still over his mouth. His lips press against Yuuri\u2019s skin while he talks, and it\u2019s probably really messed up of him to be as turned on as he is right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Yuuri says, lowering his hand. Is he blushing, or is it just the horrible fluorescent lights, or even just Viktor\u2019s imagination? He can\u2019t tell. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best anyway, considering we\u2019re supposed to be dating. It would be weird if they found out we were staying in separate rooms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Viktor agrees, mouth dry. The whole world thinks he\u2019s sleeping with Yuuri. That he gets to spend his nights curled over him, touching him, kissing him. \u201cWe should, uh, probably get going. To your room. Our room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yuuri says, except he\u2019s still leaning against the wall, and they\u2019re so close their chests are nearly touching, and it would take nothing at all for Viktor to lean down and press their lips together, to kiss him like Yuuri kissed him on that night so many months ago. But Yuuri clears his throat and repeats, \u201cYeah,\u201d a little more loudly. He pushes himself away from the wall and therefore into Viktor, and for a single delicious moment Yuuri\u2019s body is up against his, and then he\u2019s walking down the hall.</p>\n<p>It takes Viktor almost a full fifteen seconds before his brain comes back online so he can run down the hall to catch up with Yuuri instead of staring at a blank wall like an idiot.</p>\n<p>Somehow the simple acts of getting ready for bed together seem more intimate than anything else they\u2019ve done, than making out in clubs or going on a date or curling up together on his couch.</p>\n<p>He spends a long time just listening to the rise and fall of Yuuri\u2019s breathing before following his fake boyfriend into sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s intolerably early in the morning, but Yuri has already been here for ten minutes and Katsudon should <em>be here</em> by now. It\u2019s not like him to oversleep, especially the day of a competition. He\u2019s just about made up his mind to go track him door when he burst through the door, \u201cSorry, sorry! I got distracted this morning, sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, biting his lip to keep from smiling as Katsudon frantically changes into his skates. \u201cIt\u2019s your practice for your competition that you have today. Far be it from me to stand in the way of your very important beauty sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he says, just a few octaves off from a wail, and Yuri loses him composure completely and spends nearly two minutes clutching the side of the rink and laughing until he can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>He only stopes when Katsudon skates over and starts poking him in the side, babbling over his laughter that he really needs to work on his triple flip, can he please focus? Except he can\u2019t, and it ends in them spending their first ten minutes on the ice playing an increasingly ridiculous game of tag.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mila wakes to Sara\u2019s alarm, but the Italian skater only irritably throws in across the room, choosing to burrow deeper into Mila\u2019s side instead of getting ready for practice. Neither of them had bothered to put their clothes on after they\u2019d finished, and Mila can just tell that getting out of the warm cocoon of their tangled limbs underneath the heavy blanket will be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Michele hasn\u2019t barged in here yet,\u201d she says, pressing a kiss to the corning of Sara\u2019s mouth, wondering if they have enough time to make use of their lack of clothing before she really has to leave for some last second practice. Probably not.</p>\n<p>Sara kisses her back, very much on her mouth and settles her thigh between Mila\u2019s legs. Clearly she has a very different concept of time and punctuality. How Italian. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m with you, and he likes you. He says you\u2019re the only person he trusts me with, which is kind of insulting, because I can take care of myself, despite his personal beliefs. But it does mean he won\u2019t come barging in here, even if I\u2019m late for practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila likes to pretend she doesn\u2019t have emotions, but she can\u2019t help but be touched. Georgi is as good as her brother, she\u2019s known him practically her whole life and loves him as dearly as she does the rest her family. Not that she\u2019d ever tell him that. But he would never dare to get propriety with her, even if he was worried, because she would drop kick him in the face.</p>\n<p>But Michele isn\u2019t like that. Sara can hide it better, but their freaky codependent relationship runs both ways, and Sara is suspicious of any woman that tries to get close to her brother. Michele is straight up fanatical about keeping Sara safe and happy, and that he thinks Mila is someone who could keep his beloved sister safe and happy is \u2013 is really \u2013</p>\n<p>She flips them over and pins Sara to the bed, pressing a trail of kisses from her lips down her sternum.</p>\n<p>If Sara isn\u2019t going to rush off to practice, Mila isn\u2019t going to waste their time together <em>not</em> getting laid.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri is about to start his free skate, and he\u2019s nervous, because he\u2019s always nervous, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. He can still think and breathe and he\u2019s not on the edge of a panic attack like he so often is right before a competitive skate. Mila and Georgi are in the stands. Viktor\u2019s joined them in the kiss and cry because Yakov had said it would be weird if he <em>wasn\u2019t</em> there, since he\u2019s supposedly Yuuri\u2019s boyfriend. Yura\u2019s there too, because Yura had growled at Yakov when he\u2019d tried to get him to sit in the stands with his rinkmates, and Yakov hadn\u2019t tried again.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something at the back of his mind, like a thought he can\u2019t quite articulate, and it\u2019s unsettling him. He\u2019s not nervous, but he\u2019s not exactly focused either, aware something is bothering him but unsure about what exactly \u2018it\u2019 is.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been late for meeting Yura this morning because he\u2019d gotten into a discussion with Viktor about the decline in quality of Kit-Kat flavors, which was a weird conversation to have possibly ever, but doubly so at four in the morning. Except it hadn\u2019t felt weird. Yuuri sometimes struggled to hold mundane conversations with people he liked and knew, and there he was, chattering away to Viktor about the most inane of topics like it\u2019s nothing.</p>\n<p>He steps onto the ice and the music starts, and he should be focusing on his routine. It is, quite literally, the most important thing to him and his career at this moment. He\u2019s going through the moves perfectly, but he\u2019s still <em>distracted</em>, thinking about Viktor\u2019s sleep rough voice and the way he had the lines of the sheets imprinted onto his face this morning, and his hair had been all mussed into the back. Besides that first night he spent with Viktor and Chris, and he really doesn\u2019t remember much of it anyway, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever struggled to find words with Viktor. Which is so odd, because he struggles with everyone, at least in the beginning. He can keep a steady flow of words with Phichit, Chris, and Sara <em>now</em>, but that took a lot of time to build. It didn\u2019t happen automatically, or easily.</p>\n<p>The closest thing to what he has with Viktor is his relationship with Yura, but that makes sense, even if he doesn\u2019t understand it. He doesn\u2019t have much to compare it to, but it in almost no time at all Yura felt like family, like he was a missing piece in Yuuri\u2019s life. Thanks to Yura he\u2019s a stronger skater, and a better person \u2013 a kinder person, even. It was always so easy for him to get lost in his own head, to be selfish without meaning to because his problems were his only problems, for the most part. But Yura doesn\u2019t let him to do that, constantly pulling his attention to him, and to Yuuri\u2019s strengths. He likes who he\u2019s become since he\u2019s known Yura, but it\u2019s not the same as what he feels with Viktor.</p>\n<p>Viktor isn\u2019t making him whole, because he doesn\u2019t have any other missing spaces for him to fill. It\u2019s not even particularly calming being around the man sometimes, because he\u2019s so beautiful. Looking at Viktor is like looking at the sun. It\u2019s shining, and wonderful, but it can hurt. He\u2019s always known that, really, he\u2019s always been a fan of Viktor\u2019s, so he\u2019s not sure what has changed recently. Sure, there\u2019s the laughter, and the softness in the center of his chest when he\u2019s with Viktor, and how when Viktor doesn\u2019t think anyone\u2019s paying attention he\u2019ll look so <em>sad</em>, and sometimes some of the things he says just break Yuuri\u2019s heart, because Viktor is wonderful. He\u2019s wonderful and beautiful and kind, even if he\u2019s an over dramatic disaster, and he hates seeing Viktor sad, because he\u2019s in lo \u2013</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in lo \u2013</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t get himself to complete the thought, and he doesn\u2019t get a chance to try again, seeing as he\u2019s so deep in thought that he messes up his triple flip and crashes face first into the ice. He\u2019s on his feet a moment later, although the entire left side of his face is throbbing and raw. He can\u2019t tell if the liquid running down his face is sweat or blood. He glides straight back into his routine, and resists the urge to poke at his teeth with his tongue to see if any of them have come loose.</p>\n<p>That fall almost definitely destroyed his chances of getting to the Grand Prix Final, but he can\u2019t really bring himself to freak out about that right now. He\u2019s much to busy freaking out over \u2013 over realizing that he \u2013 that\u2019s he\u2019s \u2013</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in love with Viktor.</p>\n<p>Being in lust with Viktor is old news, and hardly makes him unique. But he <em>loves</em> him, loves not the image of Viktor but the man, the person who looks sad in produce aisles and forgets to plan dates and is one of the very few people that Yura trusts and who smiles at him with green onion stuck in his teeth as he compliments his cooking, his mother\u2019s recipe. That\u2019s who Yuuri\u2019s in love with.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is in love with Viktor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When Katsudon goes down, there\u2019s an audible gasp from the audience. It\u2019s bad, he misses the landing and lands in a twisted pile of limbs. It looks like a fall that ends up breaking something, that will effect the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>He and Viktor both fling their arms out to prevent the other from jumping forward, realize what they\u2019ve done, and pull their arms back.</p>\n<p>\u201cMEDIC!\u201d Yakov shouts, but Celestino hisses, \u201cNot yet!\u201d and frantically shoves his hand over Yakov\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Yuri can\u2019t look away, gripping the edge of the rink, biting his lip to keep from crying out. A second later Katsudon is pushing himself up and onto his feet, flawlessly getting back into the routine like nothing had happened. Viktor\u2019s sigh of relief leaves him like air leaves a popped balloon, but Yuri can\u2019t even spare the time to make fun of him for it.</p>\n<p>Half of Katsudon\u2019s face is torn up and bleeding, but he\u2019s skating. It doesn\u2019t look like he broke anything, like his ankle or arm or \u2013 or his back. He looks fine.</p>\n<p>The last forty five seconds of Katsudon\u2019s free skate are possibly the longest forty five seconds of his life.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor is reaching for Yuuri as soon as he steps off the ice, cupping his face in his hands pressing the edge of his sleeve against the cut along his upper jaw. \u201cYuuri! Are you okay? That looks like it really hurt!\u201d He\u2019s so, so grateful for his cover as Yuuri\u2019s boyfriend, which gives him an excuse to manhandle him like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d he says, eyes wide, \u201cReally, uh \u2013 just, just fine. Must have looked worse than it felt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he says, distressed, and he\u2019s surprised Yura hasn\u2019t pushed him aside to check on Yuuri for himself yet. Instead the younger skater is hovering next to them, lips pressed into a hard line but not making any move to get in middle of them.</p>\n<p>Lights are flashing everywhere, and he\u2019s sure pictures of the two of them will end up all over the internet by tomorrow, but he really, really doesn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor makes a disagreeable sound in the back of his throat. Yuuri fell and he\u2019s bleeding and it is, in fact, a very big deal!</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll get you checked out later to be sure,\u201d Celestino says, somehow managing to elbow in between them and place his arm around Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, guiding him over to where they\u2019ll announce his score. It happens so quickly that Viktor can only make an aborted gesture to reach after Yuuri as he\u2019s pulled away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that he notices Yuuri\u2019s blood has stained the edge of his sleeve, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising considering he literally pressed it against his bleeding wound. But seeing the stark red against the crisp white of his sweater seems \u2013 barbaric, almost. He doesn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri is shocked when scores come up, and when all is said done and he manages to scrape his way onto another podium. His fall hurt his score, but he still managed to get bronze, right behind Michele.</p>\n<p>Which means, by some miracle, he\u2019s qualified for the Grand Prix Final.</p>\n<p>Michele and Sara have as well, and Sara is absolutely ecstatic at the news. She runs over to him as soon as they all leave the kiss and cry. \u201cWe should go out!\u201d she says excitedly, \u201cMe and my two favorite boys are going to the Grand Prix Final together! In Sochi! We\u2019ll be in Russia!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in Russia <em>now</em>,\u201d he feels compelled to point out, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. Going out with Sara never ends well for him. \u201cMaybe I should just stay in tonight? Yura came all this way to see me, and it seems rude to leave him on his own\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Celestino says, clapping Yuuri hard enough on the shoulder that he staggers. \u201cYou should celebrate your victory! Yuri won\u2019t mind. Will you, Yuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks over to Yura, and he\u2019s shaking his head. \u201cYou should have fun with your friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something seems off about Yura, and he can\u2019t put his finger on what, so he feels compelled to say, \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> my friend. I really don\u2019t need to go out drinking to have fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura relaxes a little, but something still seems not quite right. \u201cGo out drinking. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he says, and he <em>sounds</em> genuine, but Yuuri can\u2019t help but have the niggling feeling that something is wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, you\u2019ve earned it,\u201d Celestino says, but the gleam in his eyes gives Yuuri the impression that he\u2019s not completely over the weeks of radio silence, and he definitely considers this punishment.</p>\n<p>Yakov sighs, \u201cIt\u2019s probably not a bad idea. You could use the publicity,\u201d carefully not saying that it would be good for Viktor and him to be photographed together considering the mixed company, but certainly implying it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he says, feeling unnecessarily ganged up on. If nothing else, it can\u2019t be worse than the last time he went clubbing in Paris with Sara.</p>\n<p>Sara squeals and jump into his arms, and he catches her in a bridal hold almost on instinct. She does that a lot. \u201cYay, we\u2019re going to have so much fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>He realizes then that the Grand Prix, he and Sara and Chris are all going to be at the same event, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to survive that.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When Sara tells them what the game plan is, wide eyed and innocent, Georgi understands completely why Mila likes her so much (Mila might think she\u2019s slick, but he\u2019s known her since they were kids, and he\u2019s known been dating Sara since the beginning.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a plan of pure evil.</p>\n<p>Granted, it\u2019s also pretty straight forward: Get Yuuri and Viktor drunk and push them at each other until they\u2019re forced to do something about all that sexual tension. He doesn\u2019t know how <em>effective</em> it will be, but most of his relationships end in the most dramatic fashion possible, so he doesn\u2019t have a lot of room to talk.</p>\n<p>Sara\u2019s smart, so they\u2019re not going out with the other skaters, the ones that Yuuri knows but who aren\u2019t actually his friends. It\u2019s him, Mila, Sara, Michele, and Viktor, meaning Yuuri <em>should</em> be comfortable, but he\u2019s been twitchy all night. He initially chalks it up at his guilt at leaving Yura behind, but halfway through the walk to the first club Sara leans over and whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s always like this at the beginning of the night. He\u2019ll be fine once we start drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finds that a little hard to believe. The Yuuri he knows is quiet and shy and not someone who would feel comfortable at all in nightclubs. Then again, he\u2019d worried Yuuri would show up in sweatpants and a sweatshirt, which is what he wears most of the time back in St. Petersburg. But he\u2019d come down in skinny jeans that had looked like they\u2019d needed to be poured on and a slim black button up, which sounds simple and fairly conservative, but somehow managed to make Yuuri look like he was a hop and skip away from working on a street corner. Viktor had practically started salivating when they\u2019d met up in the lobby of the hotel. Georgi wonders if he could bribe Yuuri into wearing some mesh next time they went out. It\u2019s entirely possible that if he could get Yuuri into a mesh top over those tight jeans, and possibly some eyeliner if he can get away with it, that Viktor would literally combust or possibly fall to his knees and weep. Either one would be hilarious and entirely worth it.</p>\n<p>His conservative estimation of Yuuri is chucked out the window about ten minutes after they get to the club. There\u2019s no keeping a low profile with the group they\u2019re in, and they\u2019re already getting some stares, and the longer people stare the tenser Yuuri becomes.</p>\n<p>Sara goes to the bar and comes back with six shots of clear alcohol. \u201cHere! This will make you feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should do hard liquor tonight,\u201d Yuuri says nervously, \u201cSomeone can have my shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Yuuri,\u201d Sara says, the thinnest layer of false disappointment covering her unholy glee, \u201cthese are all for <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor looks conflicted, but Georgi\u2019s eyes bug out of his head. Yuuri has a lot of muscle on him, but he\u2019s not exactly a large man. If he starts off with six shots now, they\u2019re going to end up having to carry him home an hour later. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Sara says pleasantly, but with the same undercurrent of steel that Mila has that makes him obey instantly. She pushes the six shots closer to Yuuri. \u201c<em>Drink</em>, mi passerotto. I insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor opens his mouth, hopefully to stop this insanity. Before he gets the chance Yuuri mutters, \u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d at Sara, and does all six shots in under a minute, one after another.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Mila grins, \u201cI like how this is going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d Yuuri says, and Michele\u2019s stone face collapses as he snickers into his hand. Georgi thinks he must be dreaming. \u201cShots take too long, I\u2019m just going to get the bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri disappears into the crowd, and he turns to Michele and Sara, \u201cAre you two shitting me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrunk Yuuri is the best Yuuri!\u201d Sara says excitedly.</p>\n<p>Michele snorts, \u201cDrunk Yuuri is a flirt. Luckily he\u2019s gotten himself a boytoy,\u201d he jerks his thumb at Viktor, who looks concerningly excited at being called Yuuri\u2019s boytoy. \u201cYou\u2019re on Yuuri wrangling duty. Don\u2019t let him get kidnapped by a group of pretty people into a sex cult or an orgy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that happen often?\u201d Georgi asks, horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time,\u201d Sara and Michele chorus as one.</p>\n<p>What the fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Viktor sighs. He follows his rinkmate\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is sitting <em>on</em> the bar, long legs crossed and one arm braced behind him. He\u2019s got his other hand wrapped around a bottle of top shelf tequila, which he\u2019s pouring directly into his mouth, head tilted back and pale neck exposed as his slick pink lips slide over the neck of the bottle. It\u2019s <em>obscene</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also definitely not allowed, but the bartender looks like the last think on her mind is telling him off. Georgi really can\u2019t blame her. He\u2019s pretty sure that if temptation had a physical form, it would be Yuuri Katsuki deep throating a bottle of tequila.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuuri probably should have seen this happening from the beginning. They start out as a group, but within a couple hours everyone has broken apart. Mila and Sara are nowhere to be found, although he catches occasional glimpses of Georgi and Michele dancing with various women.</p>\n<p>He has a high alcohol tolerance, so it generally takes him a significant about of time before he becomes well and truly drunk. But considering his recent revelation about his feelings for Viktor, being next to the man is hell, because nothing has changed, but also everything has changed. His heart is beating too fast and his face is hot, and whenever Viktor\u2019s eyes lock on his it almost feels like the beginnings of a panic attack.</p>\n<p>There is simply no way to explain any of that without confessing his newly found feelings (not an option) or looking like a crazy person. He doesn\u2019t want to get drunk and slip, doesn\u2019t want to say something that he\u2019ll regret later and will possibly ruin his relationship with Viktor forever. But then Sara puts the shots in front of him, and he takes the path of least resistance \u2013 getting so astoundingly, mind-numbingly drunk that he it won\u2019t even occur to him to have a panic attack over the fact that he\u2019s in love with Viktor Nikiforov.</p>\n<p>It works astoundingly well, except that he pops out on the other side, and all he wants to do is pin Viktor to vertical surfaces and have his way with him. To his alcohol soaked brain, there\u2019s absolutely no reason he <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> do that, so he does.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor is a little hazy, having downed one or two or three too many brightly colored drinks with the little umbrellas in them. He\u2019d thought Yuuri wrangling would be a hard job, but it\u2019s surprisingly easy, since Yuuri seems to want nothing more than to stay glued to his side, which is incredibly flattering and also makes him feel like a teenage girl.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been stuck in the throng of bodies for a while, he lost track of time a long time ago, and having Yuuri rubbing his body all over him and putting his hands all over him is driving him insane, and is most of his motivation for getting brightly colored drink after brightly colored drink. \u201cCome on,\u201d Yuuri says, damp breath against his skin, lips brushing the shell of his ear, \u201cI want to get some air.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, because Yuuri could literally suggest anything to him in that moment and he would agree.</p>\n<p>He drags them outside the back of the club, to an alley where a couple of people are smoking and chatting far from the door, but is otherwise empty. The cool air is an instant relief, they\u2019re soaked with sweat and he hadn\u2019t realized how hot he was until he wasn\u2019t anymore. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d he asks, looking to Yuuri.</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t answer. Instead he pushes him against the brick wall and goes on his tip toes so he can press his hands onto the wall on either side of Viktor\u2019s head. Yuuri\u2019s gorgeous brown eyes are hypnotically close, and Viktor doesn\u2019t feel chilled anymore, his entire body is on fire as Yuuri slides his thigh in between Viktor\u2019s legs. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmurs, and Viktor can feel his breath ghosting over his lips. His heart constricts, conflicted, because Yuuri thinks he\u2019s beautiful, but \u2013 so many people think he\u2019s beautiful. He wants Yuuri but he doesn\u2019t know if he can stand just being a beautiful person for Yuuri to touch when Viktor loves him with every fiber of his being, has loved him for nearly a year, since the first time they went drinking together. Yuuri continues muttering, \u201cLove the way you\u2019re so worried about your shirt matching your socks of all things, your ridiculous taste in clothes, how excited you get over good food, over <em>my</em> food, the way you\u2019re so patient with Yura, so patient with me, love your <em>kindness</em>, Vitya, it\u2019s all so beautiful, it makes you so beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s crying as he tilts his head enough to close to the inch of space between them, and his head is spinning with alcohol and Yuuri\u2019s words echoing though his head, and he\u2019s very certain that if he doesn\u2019t kiss Yuuri right this instant, he will die. Yuuri makes an eager little sound against his mouth that make\u2019s all of Viktor\u2019s blood rush south, and it\u2019s not cold out here <em>at all</em>, all at once he\u2019s just as hot as he was in the center of the club. \u201cWanna go back to our room?\u201d Yuuri asks, biting up his neck, and Viktor knows there\u2019s a reason that that\u2019s a bad idea, but he\u2019s had many drinks and Yuuri is against him, warm and hard and gorgeous, and he can\u2019t think of what it could possibly be.</p>\n<p>Yuuri thinks he\u2019s beautiful, but not like everyone else, thinks he\u2019s beautiful because of who he is, not what he looks like, and it\u2019s the simplest thing in the world for him to say, \u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>By the time they get back to the hotel, Yuuri has sobered up enough to realize that going to bed with Viktor, the man he\u2019s recently realized he\u2019s in love with, is courting disaster. But he doesn\u2019t actually care, because for some incomprehensible reason Viktor wants him, and he\u2019s not going to pass up his chance to have Viktor\u2019s hands on him, his mouth on him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a chance that sex could ruin their friendship, that they\u2019ll wake up in the morning and think it\u2019s a mistake, that he\u2019ll lose the easiness between them that he values so much. But the man he loves is grabbing his ass and whispering filthy things in Russian in his ear, and he\u2019s willing to risk it. They\u2019re stumbling down the hallway to their room when a familiar voice says, \u201cOh my god! Sorry, I didn\u2019t \u2013 sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pushes Viktor away, and only has a moment to feel bad about Viktor stumbling back into the hallway wall before he sees Yura sitting on the floor next their hotel room door, eyes rimmed red and mouth open in surprise. \u201cYurochka!\u201d he says, falling hard to his knees beside him. He reaches out a clumsy hand to cup his cheek, carefully looking at his pale face and the obvious signs of crying. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d he says, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t think \u2013 I\u2019ll go now, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d He tries to scramble to his feet, but Yuuri clamps a hand on his shoulder, preventing him from standing.</p>\n<p>The adrenaline and worry has a better sobering effect than anything else, and he tries to push away his drunken haze so he can focus on Yura. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. What were you waiting for me for? Was someone mean to you?\u201d If someone made Yura cry, he is one hundred percent sober enough to track them down and punch them in the face.</p>\n<p>Yura shakes his head. \u201cNothing, it was nothing, it was stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing that upsets you is stupid,\u201d Viktor says, hesitantly kneeling on the other side of Yuuri. Yura shrinks away from him, ducking his head down, and Viktor looks at Yuuri helplessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it,\u201d he says, and mourns for the briefest of moments the sex he\u2019s definitely not going to have tonight. \u201cGo get ready for bed, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura tries to bolt again, but he doesn\u2019t let him. \u201cNo, don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t think that you two would be \u2013 that you were \u2013 um, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor hesitates, but leans down to press a quick kiss to Yura\u2019s forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re more important.\u201d He squeezes Yuuri\u2019s shoulder briefly before going into their room and quietly shutting the door behind him. The fact that he doesn\u2019t seem the least bit bothered about the change of plans for the night is on one hand a little bit of blow to his ego, but also if Viktor had indicated at all that he wanted Yuuri to leave Yura alone and upset he would have had to punch him.</p>\n<p>He shifts so he\u2019s sitting next to Yura with his back to the wall and curls his arm around Yura\u2019s shoulders, pulling the smaller boy against his side. He\u2019s stiff for a moment, but the he melts into it, throwing his arm around Yuuri\u2019s stomach. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just,\u201d he tenses a little and says almost too quietly to hear, \u201cthe fall looked really bad, is all. And sometimes injuries that are really bad don\u2019t hurt at first, and \u2013 and it looked like you fell on your back, is the thing, just for a moment. And I know the medic said you were fine, and you said you were fine, and Yakov said you were fine \u2013 but I just, I was just being stupid, is all,\u201d he says, but the last bit comes out choked, and Yuuri doesn\u2019t have to look at him to know he\u2019s crying again.</p>\n<p>Yuuri feels like a complete and total moron. Yura\u2019s grandfather is in the hospital thanks to a fall, and he\u2019d had to wait in the hospital with him alone, had had to deal with all that alone until Yuuri could get to him. Then Yuuri wipes out right in front of him. It\u2019s not wonder that Yura is freaking out and worried and panicking. Maybe it\u2019s not entirely logical, but if anyone can understand the crushing panic and fear from things that aren\u2019t entirely logical, it\u2019s Yuuri.</p>\n<p>He, more than anyone, should have seen this coming. He\u2019d known Yura was upset about something, but he hadn\u2019t known what, and he\u2019s brushed it off and left him alone anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re not being stupid at all, Yurochka. It was scary for you when I fell, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura freezes, and then turns completely so he\u2019s full on hugging Yuuri with his face buried in his chest. He nods, breaths hitching and shoulders shaking. \u201cI know you\u2019re fine, I didn\u2019t mean to ruin your night, I just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, and I figured if I waited for you and saw you were fine I wouldn\u2019t worry anymore, so I did, but I didn\u2019t mean to ruin anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing is ruined,\u201d Yuuri says, rubbing his hand in soothing circles along Yura\u2019s back. \u201cHow about I spend the night in your room, and that way you can keep an eye on me? Would that make you feel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls back and wipes at his eyes, \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to,\u201d his eyes flicker to the hotel room door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably already asleep anyway,\u201d Yuuri says firmly, \u201cI\u2019m <em>fine</em>, Yurochka. But if you need to see it to believe it, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yura stares at him for several long moments, getting his tears under control and searching for any hint of lie. Then he looks down and says, \u201cIf \u2013 if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d Yuuri swears, pulling them both to their feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor knows it\u2019s not a very nice thing to do, but he\u2019s seated on the floor of their hotel room with his ear pressed to the crack, straining to hear their conversation.</p>\n<p>When Yuuri offers to go with Yura, he can\u2019t be surprised, or upset. Yura is a kid, and the list of people he trusts completely is very short. In fact, it contains exactly two people \u2013 his grandfather, and Yuuri. It\u2019s no wonder at all he freaked out at the thought of <em>both</em> of his trusted people being hurt.</p>\n<p>Still, he can\u2019t help the feeling of his heart constricting in his chest as he listens to them walk away. Yuuri had wanted him, and it would have been \u2013 they would have woken up the next morning, and Viktor could have spirited Yuuri away to breakfast, and they could have had an adult conversation about what it all meant. They couldn\u2019t avoid it anymore if they\u2019d slept together, for better or worse they would have had to <em>talk</em> about it. After Yuuri\u2019s ramblings in the alleyway, he can\u2019t help but think that maybe Chris has been right this whole time, maybe Yuuri really did like him, not just as an attractive man to make out with, but as <em>Viktor</em>. Which means the hopeful end result to this breakfast would be Yuuri agreeing to be his boyfriend for real, not just as a media ploy, and the two of them going back to their room to have sex again before packing to fly back to Russia together, to then have even more sex all over his apartment.</p>\n<p>But instead he\u2019s alone in this room, covered in sweat and alcohol, and with pressure steadily building behind his eyes that he\u2019s doing his best to ignore. Yura needs Yuuri more, so this is fine, it\u2019s all fine, and he\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri wakes up with the strangest crick to his neck, and he\u2019s confused as to why until the events of last night catch up to him, his embarrassing breakdown and Katsudon comforting him and offering to stay with him, and the two of them squeezing into his too small bed so he could press his ear against Katsudon\u2019s chest and assure himself that his heart was still beating, that he wasn\u2019t going to have to deal with the other most important person in his life getting hurt so soon after his Grandfather.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s alone in bed now, and he turns over to see Katsudon sitting in the window sill, still in last night\u2019s clothes and a distant look in his eyes as he looks out over the Paris skyline. Yuri curls up under the blankets and pillows his head in his arms, just watching him for several minutes before he works up the courage to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you and Viktor were \u2013 are \u2013 you know. I thought it was just a cover for the media.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon startles at the sound of his voice, but he\u2019s smiling when he turns his head to look at him, and Yuri can\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d he says when what Yuri said catches up with him, cheeks flushing. \u201cLast night was just \u2013 just a mistake is all. I mean I \u2013 but I\u2019m sure that Viktor doesn\u2019t, so, so, yeah,\u201d he finishes lamely.</p>\n<p>Yuri keeps starring at him, and he doesn\u2019t know if other people think Katsudon\u2019s a good liar, because as far as Yuri\u2019s concerned he\u2019s pretty crap at it. He pushes himself out of bed and walks over to him, standing directly in front of him. Katsudon raises a single eyebrow and tilts his head to the side. Yuri asks, \u201cDo you have feelings for Viktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d he says, eyes wide, which is so clearly a confirmation.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d he sighs, and boosts himself up to sit on the window ledge as well. Katsudon pulls his knees up against his chest to make room. \u201cLook, I know you have self esteem issues,\u201d Katsudon rolls his eyes but doesn\u2019t protest, which is progress, \u201cbut you trust me, right? You know I wouldn\u2019t lie to you, or make fun of you, right? I would never tell you something that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Katsudon says with gratifying quickness. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>On one hand, this will almost certainly mean he\u2019ll have to deal with even more Viktor in his life than before. On the other hand, if Viktor can make Katsudon happy, that\u2019s the only thing that really matters here. \u201cViktor is an idiot,\u201d he begins, \u201cbut also he\u2019s in love with you, which is the least idiotic thing he\u2019s done to date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsudon\u2019s mouth drops open. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t think, I mean \u2013 what, uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri raises a single finger and then launches into a speech about every piece of evidence he can think of that proves Viktor is head over heals in love with Katsudon.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Viktor has just stepped out of the shower, a towel knotted around his waist and hair in his eyes, when Yuuri bursts into their room, still wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes and looking unfairly good in them. How is that even possible? No human being should look so beautiful after falling straight into bed after a night of hard partying.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get more than a couple seconds to appreciate the view before Yuuri says, words tumbling over each other, \u201cYura says you\u2019re in love with me, is that true? Because if it is I\u2019m in love with you too. I mean, I guess I\u2019m in love with you whether you love me or not, because that\u2019s how love works, but if \u2013 if you do love me, you should know that I love you too. Or if you don\u2019t love me, I guess I just love you, no too added. But no pressure if you don\u2019t feel the same way, I don\u2019t want you to feel pres\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor freezes at the first sentence, but by the end of that rambling question he\u2019s beaming. He does what Yuuri did to him last night, and pins him against the wall and presses their mouths together. Yuuri freezes, and Viktor starts to back up, worried he\u2019s done something wrong. But then Yuuri\u2019s arms encircle his waist and pull him closer, pressing them together again and Yuuri\u2019s mouth is eager under his.</p>\n<p>His towel drops and he\u2019s fumbling at the buttons of Yuuri\u2019s shirt, desperate to touch him, to kiss him. Yuuri finally figures out what he\u2019s doing and pushes him back onto the bed, and he\u2019s flushed red as he looks at Viktor spread out before him. \u201cSo is that a yes then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Viktor says, and then hooks his foot around the back of Yuuri\u2019s knees and yanks so he falls down on top of him.</p>\n<p>They only have a couple hours before they have to leave to catch their flight, and Viktor plans to make the most of them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Chris is curled up under his covers, scrolling through his news feed, when he gets a text message from Viktor.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s better than a phone call, but he\u2019s already resigned himself to a three paragraph ode to the curve of Yuuri\u2019s ass. Or, well it\u2019s Viktor, so it\u2019s might be about his \u2018gentle spirit\u2019 or whatever.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a picture. He impatiently waits for it to load, and when it does he screams.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Viktor and Yuuri from the waist up, lying in bed and clearly naked. Yuuri\u2019s covered his face with his hands and Viktor is beaming, and there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that the two of them have just had sex. Another message comes in reading: <em>he\u2019s my boyfriend now!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</em></p>\n<p>He tries to call both of them, but it goes straight to voicemail, and this is the worst. He\u2019s endured so much, dealt with so much, and they don\u2019t even have the decency to answer his phone call!</p>\n<p>Despicable.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Yuri was worried things would change, now that Viktor and Katsudon are dating for real, and not just as a ploy for the media.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Michele and Sara make fun of Viktor for being love struck to his face instead of behind his back, and Katsudon is now way more shy around paparazzi now that he really is Viktor\u2019s boyfriend. But he doesn\u2019t start spending the night at Viktor\u2019s, he still trains more with Yuri than anyone else, he\u2019s still <em>there</em> for him in a way almost no one else has been his whole life.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s incredibly grateful for that, but it\u2019s way too mortifying of a sentiment to ever say out loud, so instead he tries to glare at Viktor a little less since he\u2019s Katsudon\u2019s boyfriend and hopes the sentiment gets across.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re over thinking this,\u201d Phichit says, his face filling up Yuuri\u2019s laptop screen as he paces back and forth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can I be overthinking this? It\u2019s a big decision!\u201d he says, and tries not to sound like he\u2019s whining, but almost certain that he does.</p>\n<p>Phichit rolls his eyes. \u201cLook, you\u2019re my best friend, and obviously what <em>I </em>want is for you to come back to Detroit and continue being my roommate and my rinkmate. But Viktor Nikiforov is your <em>boyfriend</em> now! You\u2019ll always be my best friend. But long distance relationships are way harder to maintain than long distance friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut school! And I don\u2019t even know if Yakov wants to be my coach, I don\u2019t want him to feel obligated just because I\u2019m dating Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit sighs, but before he gets a chance to say anything there\u2019s a knock on his door, and Yura comes in without waiting for him to answer. \u201cYou guys are so loud, I can hear you, you know,\u201d he bounces down on the edge of Yuuri\u2019s bed. \u201cYakov would love to take you on, don\u2019t be ridiculous, and it\u2019s not because of Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he blinks, sheepish, \u201csorry Yurochka, I didn\u2019t mean for you to hear any of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves his hand, \u201cWhatever, don\u2019t worry about it. But Phichit\u2019s wrong,\u201d Phichit makes an offended sound, but doesn\u2019t attempt to interrupt any more than that. \u201cDon\u2019t stay because of Viktor. If he really loves you, the two of you will manage long distance just fine. If he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be here to punch him in the face. Don\u2019t stay because of me either, Grandpa\u2019s going to be stuck in the hospital for another couple months, but I can take care of myself. So don\u2019t do anything because of Viktor, or me, or the media, or anyone else either. The <em>only </em>reason you should stay is if it\u2019s what you <em>want</em>. You\u2019re family,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cand you\u2019ll stay family even if you go back to Detroit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares at him for a long moment, and Yura\u2019s face is slowly turning red from embarrassment. Before he can take any of it back, Yuuri pulls him to feet and grabs him in a tight hug. \u201cOkay then,\u201d he says, trying not to sound as choked as he feels, \u201cI\u2019ll do only what I want then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood!\u201d Yura says, although it comes out kinda muffled since his face is pressed into Yuuri\u2019s sternum.</p>\n<p>He hears the tell tale click as Phichit takes a photo of them through the webcam. He flips him off behind Yura\u2019s back, and knows he angled it correctly when his best friend cackles.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>In the Grand Prix Finals, Yuuri loses to Viktor by three quarters of point. He takes silver, while Chris gets bronze. He can see Yura and Phichit booing from the stands, Yura\u2019s gold medal from the junior competition around his neck, and he has to bite his lip to keep from laughing as the cameras flash all around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I have to drag you out tonight, or will you come willingly?\u201d Chris asks from the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Yuuri sighs. Sara, Michele, Mila, and Georgi are all here too. It\u2019s going to be a complete disaster. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris beams.</p>\n<p>After they get down from the podiums, he goes to stand by Celestino for the last time. There\u2019s a cluster of reporters waiting for them, to officially release what the ice skating world has been buzzing about for weeks \u2013 he and Celestino going their separate ways, and his permanent relocation to St. Petersburg to study under Yakov.</p>\n<p>And to be closer to his boyfriend and Yurochka, but that\u2019s something he\u2019ll leave to the rumor mill, also known as Phichit.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still so much to figure out \u2013 shipping all his stuff from Detroit, and getting his permanent residency for Russia, and finding a university that at least teaches in English once he maxes out how many online credits his current college will accept.</p>\n<p>At the very least, he won\u2019t have to worry about finding a place to live. He\u2019s staying with Yurochka until his grandfather is fully recovered, and after that \u2013</p>\n<p>Well, Viktor had asked him to move in with him last night.</p>\n<p>He knows this should be an ending, moving from Detroit and leaving Celestino, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it.</p>\n<p>It feels like the last beginning he\u2019ll ever need.</p>"
