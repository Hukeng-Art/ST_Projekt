  "text": "<p>\u201cBut, Mr. Hale, sir\u2026I don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hesitated, glancing surreptitiously down at the name on Peter\u2019s memo. \u201c\u2026Mr. Greenberg, Hale Industries\u2019 internship program was instated to seek out the best and brightest minds for our entry-level positions. Unfortunately, your performance in the past few months has fallen significantly behind those of your colleagues, so we have no choice but to let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kid, <em>Greenberg</em>, stood red-faced and gaping in the middle of the bullpen of cubicles, the other still-employed interns hunched over their keyboards pretending not to listen.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-but I need this job! I spent four years on my finance degree to get here! I still have student loans to pay off! I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go,\u201d Greenberg moaned, crumpling into a slobbering lump at Derek\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>Derek resisted the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose as his ex-employee wheezed on the office floor. This was supposed to be Finstock\u2019s responsibility, but the head of Finance had conveniently succumbed to food poisoning at the end of the quarter, so Derek had opened up his e-mail at six-thirty a.m. that day to find Peter\u2019s memo with a list of names to pink-slip.</p>\n<p>Greenberg\u2019s was the last name on the list, thank God - It was already nearing six in the evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need your ID badge before you go, Mr. Greenberg.\u201d The ex-intern whimpered, pawing his way off the floor to remove the lanyard from around his neck and handed it to Derek with trembling hands. \u201cIf you have any further questions, please contact HR. Good luck in your future.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Derek turned towards the elevators, he heard Greenberg stifle a sob and slump back into what was no longer his chair. It sent a pang of guilt through him, but Derek gritted his teeth and kept walking. After all, the kid had to be smart enough to find another job \u2013 Hale Industries\u2019 internship program was one of the most competitive in the country, and other companies would be scrambling to hire one of their former interns, even one that had been let go.</p>\n<p>That, and Allison in HR would undoubtedly help out. The woman had the ability to turn r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into works of art. Greenberg would be fine.</p>\n<p>Still, dealing with people\u2019s emotions all day had been taxing, and despite all that Peter had tried to teach him, Derek had never been able to see their employees as purely cogs in the machine, at least not when they stood face-to-face with him, begging for second or third chances. It kept him from making the hard decisions, Peter said. It\u2019s why Derek stayed sequestered in his office almost all of the time, only leaving to go home, or on rare occasions like today, at Peter\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p>The damn elevator moved so slow. It dinged when it finally reached the thirty-first floor, doors sliding open to his personal assistant\u2019s rigid smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening Mr. Hale, I haven\u2019t seen you all day,\u201d Erica said breezily, her smile easing at the sight of him. \u201cYou have four messages on your phone, I\u2019ve scheduled your video conferences for the rest of the week, and I\u2019ve already put in your regular order at Angelo\u2019s. Your meatball sub will be here in fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiled fondly. She was one person he didn\u2019t need to hide it from \u2013 Erica was a machine herself, ruthless and cunning, and with an eidetic memory for his calendar out to the year 2025.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Erica. You\u2019re free to go home \u2013 I won\u2019t be needing you for the rest of the evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raised a carefully manicured eyebrow at him. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the liberty of ordering two meatball sub sandwiches on the off-chance that you will be, Mr. Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiled widely. Erica could match him in appetite even with her slight frame, probably needing all that energy to power that massive brain of hers. He sometimes thought that she could run Hale Industries single-handedly, if she ever tried to depose both Peter and him.</p>\n<p>But he knew she wasn\u2019t that Machiavellian. Hopefully.</p>\n<p>And turns out that he <em>did</em> need Erica\u2019s help, several times over the next hour, until she had to leave for her Zumba class. For the next half hour, Derek fiddled with his scheduling program until a couple meetings disappeared completely.</p>\n<p>User-friendly, his ass. He\u2019d beg Erica to salvage them in the morning; he was done for the night.</p>\n<p>Derek slid his jacket back on and picked up his bag, seeing the intern\u2019s badge out of the corner of his eye. Allison would need that back to deactivate it \u2013 he\u2019d drop it off in her mailbox on his way down.</p>\n<p>As the elevator crawled from thirty-one to twenty-five, Derek checked his watch. Eight-thirty. He heaved a sigh - he\u2019d been at work for the past fourteen hours. And there were still unread e-mails in his inbox to check from home.</p>\n<p>The elevator dinged, and Derek took a step forward when the doors slid open, almost running straight into the man walking in.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dude! Sorry, I wasn\u2019t even looking. Figured I was the only one left in the building,\u201d the man (or <em>kid</em>, rather) said, his brown eyes wide and tracking down Derek\u2019s body. Derek took an involuntary step back.</p>\n<p>The kid walked to his side as the doors slid shut. For a few seconds they stood there in silence, until they both seemed to realize simultaneously that the elevator hadn\u2019t moved. Derek surged forward at the same time the kid\u2019s hand flew towards the panel, and Derek dodged it reflexively, but the kid laughed aloud, reaching in front of Derek to press \u2018G\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you forgot to hit that earlier. Hey! You\u2019re interning too? What department?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Intern\u2026?</em> Derek turned and stared at the kid in confusion, before following his gaze to the telltale blue badge in Derek\u2019s hand. <em>Oh.</em> Before he could open his mouth to correct him, the kid stretched his neck closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cD. Greenberg, Financial,\u201d he read out loud. \u201cMan, they must have a strict dress code for you guys if their interns even have to wear monkey suits. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, you look\u2026you look good, but R&amp;D could care less. Exhibit A.\u201d The kid gestured down his body.</p>\n<p>Derek swept his eyes down, taking in the kid\u2019s gelled, brown hair, black plastic-frame glasses, cardigan and T-shirt, and\u2026were those cargo pants? Derek might need to have a word with the head of R&amp;D about professionalism. He looked back up, pausing on the blue badge around the kid\u2019s neck. <em>G. Stilinski \u2013 Research and Development.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look too impressed. I\u2019m Stiles,\u201d G. Stilinski said, holding out a hand\u2026that Derek stared at until it lowered itself in submission.</p>\n<p>The person attached to the hand apparently had no such sense of self-preservation. \u201cGee, all those numbers you work with in your head haven\u2019t left any room for proper social etiquette, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowned at this\u2026<em>Stiles</em>, but it did nothing to deter him. \u201cI mean, Scott\u2019s dumb as a bag of rocks but he\u2019s the nicest guy ever, so maybe there is a correlation.\u201d Stiles paused, actually <em>scrunching</em> his nose. \u201cBut no, Lydia\u2019s a genius and upper management adores her, she\u2019s just an ice queen to us commoners but we dote on her anyway\u2026I mean, don\u2019t be fooled, I\u2019m actually about to keel over, it\u2019s just too much effort to maintain a verbal filter when I\u2019m tired, but I just spent the last 2 hours on the specs for Lydia\u2019s prototype because I didn\u2019t want her to strain her brain, because Derek Hale is a horrible, <em>horrible</em> man-\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows had been furrowing in bewilderment for the absence of breathing between Stiles\u2019 words, but at that they shot straight up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Does he ride you guys as hard as he rides R&amp;D? No, stupid question, of course he does,\u201d Stiles scoffed, not waiting for an answer. \u201cThe man\u2019s a slave-driver that no one\u2019s ever seen, just felt his whip, and whip, thy name is Erica Reyes, PA- did you hear about how she made Isaac cry at orientation? Isaac \u201cSunshine-and-Rainbows\u201d Lahey. And all he did was ask if we had Smartfood popcorn in the vending machine. Which is a totally legitimate question by the way, it\u2019s one of the lowest calorie on-the-go options and you\u2019d think the company would want its employees to be eating healthy, but no, we don\u2019t even have time to run to the vending machines.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek let out a snort at the mental image of Erica berating an intern for a snack preference as it sounded exactly like her, but again Stiles misread him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, right? Like, good god, we\u2019re already working our asses off, while Derek Hale sits in his shiny office and sends his four-inch-heeled Amazon with request after request. And he\u2019s next in line for the corporate throne! I mean, can you imagine? I\u2019ve heard his sister Laura\u2019s an angel but decided the arts were more her forte and didn\u2019t want anything to do with the family business. It\u2019s too bad she\u2019s not the one in charge\u2026I bet she\u2019d order Smartfood popcorn for us. If it weren\u2019t for Hale Industries\u2019 reputation, I bet none of the interns would want to be permanently employed by Derek Hale, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u2018ever\u2019 was punctuated by the elevator jerking to a halt, and Stiles was halfway out the door before it opened completely.</p>\n<p>Derek watched him go, but Stiles spun around suddenly to hold the doors open.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s the \u2018D\u2019 in your name stand for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he answered reflexively.</p>\n<p>Stiles stared openly at him for a long second. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d he snorted. \u201cSee you around, Derek Greenberg.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sped off, leaving Derek alone in the elevator for who knew how long, until he had to throw out an arm to stop the doors from closing again.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Derek dropped the badge off in Allison\u2019s office the next morning, before anyone had actually arrived. He rode the elevator up to his own office, and opened up his inbox to a slew of e-mails from Peter regarding negotiations with the head of the Hunter Corporation, Chris Argent. Apparently things were going less than swimmingly. Recently, Peter had become adamant on expanding into the weapons industry, something that Derek was not in support of in the least, but now he was being called to smooth things over with the largest weapons manufacturer in North America. All because Peter managed to rub another client the wrong way.</p>\n<p>It was too early in the morning for this. Any other day, Derek would have grit his teeth and put his mediating skills (which were few, but still more than Peter\u2019s) to work, but something had been niggling at his brain since the night before, a twitching concern that couldn\u2019t stay still.</p>\n<p>He pressed the intercom button on his desk. \u201cErica, how do we add something to the vending machines downstairs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust let me know what you\u2019d like and I can get it for you, Mr. Hale,\u201d the speaker buzzed back.</p>\n<p>Derek frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me- I mean, I spoke with an employee yesterday and he requested that we add Smartpop\u2026Smartcorn-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSmartfood popcorn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a long silence on the other end. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighed. \u201cYes Erica, I-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, that can absolutely be arranged, sir. I\u2019ll bring you the vending company catalog and order form for you to sign off on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He chose to ignore the thread of incredulity in his PA\u2019s voice. \u201cThank you, Erica.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek switched off the intercom and sat back in his chair, staring at the wall for a full minute before slumping back with a frown.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d hoped solving that <em>issue</em> would have made the nagging feeling in his head go away, but it was still there in full force, like the kid from last night had bombarded him with a deluge of words and he was still soaked and starting to feel itchy.</p>\n<p>If he thought about it, no one had talked to him that much since before Laura moved away, before his mom and dad died. Laura still called but it wasn\u2019t the same as seeing her face, and Peter only spoke to him when it was relevant to the company. Everyone else cowered in fear, much less spoke their minds to him, but this kid hadn\u2019t recognized Derek.</p>\n<p>Stiles had pretty much called Derek Hale the bane of his existence.</p>\n<p>And he didn\u2019t know if that felt more hurtful or more refreshing.</p>\n<p>Derek picked up the phone and dialed the extension for HR.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison, It\u2019s Derek Hale. I\u2019m going to need the personnel file for one of our employees.\u201d</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Stiles was smart. Exceptionally, actually, if his academic record was any indication. Top of his class in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley, and mentored by one of the emeritus faculty in the program. His senior capstone project was entitled the \u2018Bipolar Prepuce Forceps\u2019, which turned out to be a surgical device for more sterile, faster-healing circumcisions.</p>\n<p>How he talked his teammates into that, Derek has no idea.</p>\n<p>But it probably involved just that. <em>Talking</em>.</p>\n<p>They probably caved to all the diagrams of penises just to get him to stop.</p>\n<p>It was stupid. The chances that Derek was going to run into Stiles again were incredibly slim. There were hundreds of people that worked in the building, that used the elevators every day, and Derek had never run into that bespectacled whirlwind of an intern before yesterday. Still, it was all he could think about for the rest of the morning and afternoon, in the middle of sorting out the Chris Argent issue and fielding other requests from Peter.</p>\n<p>By the time eight-thirty rolled around again, Derek already had his briefcase in hand. He\u2019d told Erica to go home at six, and hoped that everyone else had cleared out of the building as well. The elevator crawled downwards, past the other executive offices, past legal, and marketing, and HR\u2026but the elevator didn\u2019t slow when the digital display flicked from 24 to 23, and kept on descending.</p>\n<p>Stiles had probably gone home already, with the rest of R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>And there was absolutely no reason for Derek to be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Or that\u2019s what he told himself, as he stepped out to an empty lobby and headed outside, where the streetlights were already on and the lone cab stalled on the curb.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the week, Derek left when he usually left, or whenever his work allowed him, and didn\u2019t run into Stiles again.</p>\n<p>Still, when the assignments crossed his desk for him to allocate to the engineers in R&amp;D, he thought of how much potential Stiles\u2019 file showed, and how he might enjoy some of the projects Derek would typically assign to the more seasoned engineers. Maybe it was the tedium of what the interns worked on, tweaking and refining existing devices, that made Stiles so bitter towards Der- towards his job.</p>\n<p>Derek sent the assignments down to R&amp;D via Erica, and tried all weekend not to think about how Stiles would react to the project he\u2019d picked for him.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>The following Tuesday, Derek\u2019s teleconference with a client in Beijing kept him in the office until eight. Just as he started to shut his computer down, his inbox pinged with a new e-mail.</p>\n<p><strong>H.I. Prototype No. 118695 </strong>from<strong> Stiles Stilinski, R&amp;D. </strong></p>\n<p>Derek nearly knocked the mouse off his desk in his haste to click.</p>\n<p><strong> <em>From: </em> </strong> <em>Stiles Stilinski, R&amp;D<br></em><strong><em>Time</em> </strong> <em>: Tuesday, September 4th, 2012 8:07:24 PM PDT</em><br><strong> <em> To</em> </strong> <em>: Alan Deaton, R&amp;D</em><br><strong> <em> CC</em> </strong> <em>: Derek Hale, VP</em><br><strong> <em> Subject</em> </strong> <em>: H.I. Prototype No. 118695</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Dr. Deaton,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ve attached the specifications for the prototype #118695 assigned to me last Friday (I apologize if it\u2019s a bit late). Please let me know if any changes should be made before I submit the prototype for presentation. I\u2019ve also copied Mr. Hale on this to keep him informed of my progress.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Regards,</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Stiles Stilinski<br></em> <em>Research &amp; Development Intern</em></p>\n<p>Derek clicked on the attachment at the bottom of the e-mail, and watched as pages of Stiles\u2019 drafts popped up on his screen. They all looked flawless as far as he could tell\u2026but that was impossible. Manually pressing the power-button on his computer (safe-shutdown be damned), he grabbed his jacket and briefcase and dashed out to the elevator.</p>\n<p>That was an original prototype that had just been approved for development. Which meant any decent engineer would spend weeks to months working on the specifications, not to mention an <em>intern</em>.</p>\n<p>Who finished in the span of three days.</p>\n<p>This time the elevator slowed at floor twenty-three, the doors sliding open to a very disheveled Stiles, his stained hoodie hanging limply off his frame and flattened hair sticking out from under his beanie. Derek almost choked at the sight, if it weren\u2019t for how Stiles\u2019 dark-circled eyes suddenly lit up behind his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>Still caught off guard by Stiles\u2019 appearance, Derek opted to stare back in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, aren\u2019t <em>you</em> a sight for sore eyes? And I mean really sore. Like, I\u2019m seeing two of you right now, which isn\u2019t a bad thing at all-\u201c</p>\n<p>The doors started to close. Derek threw an arm out and dragged Stiles inside, steadying him when it was clear the momentum was sending him into a face-plant.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thanks, I\u2019m such a klutz,\u201d Stiles laughed, but it came out as more of a wheeze. \u201cThen again, it might be the whole not-sleeping-for-four-days-and-subsisting-on-Snickers-Red-Bull-and-popcorn\u2019 thing. That\u2019s protein and vegetables, right? Hey, did you hear that we got the popcorn in the vending machines now? The corporate gods have smiled upon us. Speaking of which, I think Derek Hale wants to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gaped at Stiles, but the intern\u2019s eyes were half-lidded and focused on a spot on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, I just wanted to go home this past weekend and play WoW and battle mythical creatures and shit, but Derek Hale is a giant ogre that wants to grind my bones to make his bread. Like, why would he do that? Why would he give me this giant project when all the other interns have the normal refine-and-adjust work and expect me to meet the same deadline?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek felt a sense of dawning realization mixed with horror. The interns normally completed their work in a matter of days, and Stiles\u2019 hadn\u2019t been told otherwise when he\u2019d been given the new assignment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he wants to fire me. Derek Hale wants to see me fail so he has a reason to fire me. But he can\u2019t! Because I finished the damn thing! I even copied him on the e-mail to my boss so he can see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lifted his hands in a weak approximation of raising-the-roof. \u201cSo take <em>that</em>, Derek Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wanted to kick himself. This was the complete opposite of what he wanted, and even hearing Stiles acknowledge the popcorn gesture had been overshadowed by just how much of a massive <em>idiot</em> Derek felt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn other news,\u201d Stiles segued, interrupting Derek\u2019s mental stream of self-reproach. \u201cOr at least, I\u2019m pretty sure it actually happened, unless I\u2019ve really been that out of it, but Scott finally asked Allison out and she said yes. Miracle of miracles. Actually, getting Lydia to acknowledge my existence would fall under that category. But if Scott has a shot with Allison, beloved queen of HR, there may be hope for me yet- I could just, I don\u2019t know, get her a lapdog, or braid flowers into her strawberry-blonde hair, or lay my lab coat across a puddle\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>There was something wrong with the elevator\u2019s ventilation. Something in the air was clearly making Derek feel warmer and crankier, and made him want to trip someone in high-heels or stick his hand in some perfectly styled hair and tug. What the hell.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But I look nothing like <em>you</em>, I mean, you must be dodging women left and right, with that facial symmetry and manly stubble, and your <em>eyes</em>, dude. What color are they even?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek watched dumbfounded as Stiles leaned into his personal space, golden-brown eyes boring into his own. He felt even warmer (but suddenly less cranky) when Stiles\u2019 gaze slid down his face and settled on his mouth, which\u2026which was hanging open.</p>\n<p>The elevator dinged, and Derek shut his mouth with an audible <em>click</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles smiled lazily at him one last time, and stumbled out into the lobby. Derek involuntarily reached out to steady him again, and vaguely considered calling him a cab, but Stiles simply patted him on the shoulder and staggered towards the bike rack outside.</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t even know they had a bike rack.</p>\n<p>He watched as Stiles made several unsuccessful attempts to unlock his bike, but once he was on it he was surprisingly graceful. Stiles weaved through the parked cars, finally disappearing around the corner of a building before Derek looked away and hailed his own cab to head home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s apartment was dark and quiet. He threw his keys in the bowl by the door and made a beeline for the bar, pouring himself a finger or two of scotch before settling in on the modular couch by the window, watching the tiny lights crawl along the bottom of the high-rise.</p>\n<p>Derek swirled the tumbler in his hand. The golden liquid reminded him of a certain set of eyes, the way they flickered every time the intern\u2019s brain switched directions\u2026Derek scowled. This is why Peter was right \u2013 this is why he should never have\u2026gotten attached to an employee, and now he\u2019d driven Stiles even farther away.</p>\n<p>Even though Stiles still thought he was Derek <em>Greenberg</em>.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter now \u2013 even if Derek told him the truth, Stiles would probably hate him more for the deception. He should just leave Stiles alone, and let things go back to the way they were, with Stiles hating him from a distance and inevitably leaving H.I. for someplace like the Hunter Corporation-</p>\n<p>Derek scowled. The thought of <em>that</em> was even worse than hearing about Stiles\u2019 crush on the R&amp;D girl.</p>\n<p>Derek loosened his death grip on the tumbler. He rubbed at his temples and tried to relax into the couch, but the cushions were too firm, some Swedish design someone at some agency had been overpaid to put in his flat. Nowhere near as comfortable as the cushy sofa his family had growing up, with its chocolate milk stains and cushions that he and Laura used to build blanket forts\u2026</p>\n<p>Derek took out his phone and hit the first speed-dial.</p>\n<p>Ring. Ring. \u201cDer-Der!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s lip quirked. He hated the name growing up, but he heard it so rarely these days. Derek could still here his mother\u2019s voice whispering, <em>There, there, Derek. Hush now</em>, his sister echoing in the background, <em>Der-Der, Derek!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the series coming along?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s coming. I\u2019m covered in paint as we speak, baby bro. You get the invite for my gallery opening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI booked my flight last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>His sister made an approving sound. \u201cSo, what\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>There\u2019s this intern...</em>\u201d-Peter\u2019s sending me to Beijing next month to meet with some clients.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. Peter making you do his dirty work isn\u2019t news, Derek, that\u2019s all he ever does.\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek sighed. \u201cLaura-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you need to get away from H.I. once in awhile, Derek. Go out and meet people, find a new hobby-\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek cringed. Last time Laura suggested he find a new hobby, she\u2019d sent him a couple crates of painting supplies, he managed to mix a muddy brown color on the palette instead of sky blue, and the rest of the supplies had gone straight to the local community center.</p>\n<p>\u201c-I knew it wasn\u2019t for me, and you\u2019re still young, Derek. I just don\u2019t want you to end up like Peter,\u201d Laura finished softly.</p>\n<p>Peter lived at the office. When his uncle wasn\u2019t at the office, he lived alone. Peter had more money than he knew what to do with, so there was nothing to do but make more.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t have someone to tell him when he\u2019d messed up and needed to stop, who made sure he ate healthy, who was smart as hell, whose giant eyes lit up whenever he saw him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I already have? What if the only person who\u2019s talked to me already hates me?\u201d Derek muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tried to talk to someone and they said they hated you?\u201d Laura asked incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he never - I\u2019m the one who \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know who I am-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ll</em> say. No one that knows anything about you could possibly hate you, you hear me? If this\u2026if this guy really knew what you\u2019re like and he still doesn\u2019t like you? He\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek drained the last few drops in the glass. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>The line went quiet for a moment. \u201cDerek, he\u2019s not Kate. Don\u2019t be afraid to let someone in again, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded slowly. \u201cYeah. Yeah, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t assign Stiles any more original projects. He let things go back to normal, trying to treat Stiles like any of the other interns even if it meant Stiles was still cursing him from another part of the building.</p>\n<p>At least this way, he couldn\u2019t make things worse.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Erica opened his office door one day, stepping aside to let Allison in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the interruption, Mr. Hale, but Allison has something important she needs to discuss with you. Off the record.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raised an eyebrow, before turning to the man sitting across from him. \u201cMr. Boyd, if you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a problem, sir. I\u2019ll just update you on the repairs budget via e-mail,\u201d the head of maintenance said, rising and exiting quietly.</p>\n<p>Derek gestured to the now vacant chair across from his desk and Allison took a tentative seat. \u201cMr. Hale, I\u2019m not- I shouldn\u2019t be here, but you know who my father is and what the Hunter Corporation does,\u201d she began nervously. \u201dI work for H.I. because I don\u2019t want to be a part of a company that produces weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded solemnly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know that I heard them talking, but the Hunter execs are instituting a lateral hiring plan for Hale Industries\u2019 interns before they\u2019re officially signed on here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cArgent is planning on poaching our interns to work for Hunter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my grandfather\u2019s idea - they\u2019ve discussed offering them higher starting salaries and more flexibility,\u201d she said, eyes turned to the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tapped his pen on the desk. \u201cThank you for coming to me, Allison. I\u2019ll discuss this with the rest of the board-\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison looked up. \u201c-And your name will never come up. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>A look of relief passed over her face. \u201cThank you, Mr. Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded at her as she stepped back out, before buzzing Erica to arrange a board meeting.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>If Derek rode the elevator up and down for nearly an hour that evening, well, nobody needed to know.</p>\n<p>When the doors opened and it was finally Stiles standing there, slurping loudly through a plastic straw, Derek let out the breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding\u2026and then promptly tensed back up.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t planned beyond making sure Stiles still worked there.</p>\n<p>\u201cD-man! How\u2019s it hangin\u2019, bro?...You look a little green.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek may have developed a bit of motion sickness over the last half hour.</p>\n<p>Stiles stepped into his space. \u201cSeriously, you okay? You look like you need to sit down, or eat some saltines, or I\u2019ve got this blue slushie if that\u2019ll help?\u201d Stiles shook the cup at him, and the sudden wave of nausea must have shown on Derek\u2019s face. \u201cOkay artificially colored syrup probably isn\u2019t a good idea right now, but you should really pop a squat, come on now.\u201d Stiles grabbed Derek\u2019s elbow and manhandled him down to the floor, before settling in cross-legged next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Stiles asked. Derek took a deep breath and nodded. The urge to lose his lunch was starting to subside.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what is it \u2013 week-old potato salad? Bad fiscal quarter? You forget the covers on your TPS reports?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek turned and looked at Stiles. The intern looked better than he\u2019d ever seen him, no dark circles around his eyes and his usual twitch subdued. Derek huffed at Stiles\u2019 lips, tinted blue from nursing his drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let it get to you,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cEven if your boss rips you a new one for screwing up, y\u2019know. <em>This too shall pass</em> and all that. I mean, look at me, I survived the Great Hale Storm of 2012 and kept my job! Whatever that guy\u2019s throwing at you is nothing you can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ha, well, Derek Hale\u2019s existence is definitely my greatest obstacle right now.</em> But what Stiles thought of him didn\u2019t matter anymore. All Derek wanted was to know if Stiles was happy with his job.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like working here?\u201d Derek asked tiredly.</p>\n<p>Stiles paused, his eyes widening in an expression of surprise, glancing down to Derek\u2019s mouth. His gaze lingered there, until Stiles shook his head and met Derek\u2019s eyes with a sincere look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yeah. I mean, I get to play with robots and machines all day. How cool is that? And that project from hell that I told you about? Other than the deadline, that project was <em>awesome</em>. I got to design a light bulb that recycles its own <em>thermal energy</em>. Best job ever or best job ever? Plus, you won\u2019t find better benefits anywhere on the west coast, and the holiday parties are the bomb. Insider tip: if you can sneak into Marketing\u2019s holiday bash, their eggnog is more liquor than\u2026nog.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Stiles expounded on all of Hale Industries many merits, it felt more to him like <em>Stiles</em> was the one trying to convince Derek to stay at H.I. It made something in Derek\u2019s chest clench to see Stiles gesticulating enthusiastically about everything from the prototype machines to the vending machines, his smile wide and uninhibited.</p>\n<p>The elevator dinged at the ground floor, and Stiles stopped abruptly to level him with an indecipherable look.</p>\n<p>Derek averted his eyes, rolling forward onto his hands and knees to reach for his suitcase, when a choked off sound came from behind. When he glanced over his shoulder, Stiles was staring back at him red-faced, before scrambling up to his feet and slipping out of the elevator, his bag clutched tightly in front of him.</p>\n<p>Derek stood and dusted off his pants. By the time he walked out to the street, Stiles and his bike were already long gone.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>He started running into Stiles more often. Always in the elevator and not every day, but Derek began to get used to the hoodies and cargo shorts that seemed to make up Stiles\u2019 wardrobe, graphic tees with superheroes and physics jokes emblazoned on them.</p>\n<p>He noticed that Stiles looked him up and down as often as Derek did it to him, and he made an effort to stand taller and straighter, the panels of his suit stretching tight across his chest. It made Derek feel oddly smug when Stiles\u2019 eyes would drift down, his rapid speech slowing momentarily before speeding back up.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026And don\u2019t tell anybody, but I just stole all the blue paperclips because those are the only kind Matt uses. Weirdo. <em>Nobody</em> blatantly hits on my best friend\u2019s girl and gets away with it! Seriously, everybody and their mom knows that Allison and Scott just started going steady, so he was totally doing it just to be a dick, and offering to do a <em>photo shoot</em> of her? That\u2019s just creepy, dude. I mean, I understand desperation, but we\u2019re at work, am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowned at the idea of this \u2018Matt\u2019 guy harassing Allison, but merely grunted in response. It was something Laura had always poked fun at him for \u2013 <em>Use your words, Der-Der. Mom didn\u2019t raise you to be a caveman, no matter how much you look like one</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles talked to him about everything. Derek now felt like he knew everything, from Scott\u2019s old crush on their first grade teacher to the pharmacology of <em>platypus venom</em>. And Stiles seemed happier, complained about his workload less often and hardly ever mentioned his deep and endless hatred for \u2018Derek Hale, vice president\u2019 anymore. For the first time, Derek felt hopeful, like Stiles might not leave and Derek could keep him, and maybe, maybe Stiles\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Maybe Stiles</em> nothing. Stiles didn\u2019t know anything about the real him, because Derek had never given him anything. It had never occurred to him before - at first, Derek had just been in awe that someone felt enough at ease with him to speak freely, and before long he\u2019d just came to revel in the comfort of Stiles\u2019 presence. But Stiles could never feel anything for Derek if he still knew nothing about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth to Grumpy-Face,\u201d Stiles said, waving a hand in front of Derek\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m trying to describe the awesomeness of my new ergonomic chair to you. It\u2019s like sitting on a cloud, a fluffy cumulonimbus, I swear I could hear my lumbar vertebrae singing the Hallelujah chorus-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cMy favorite color is black,\u201d Derek blurted, flinching back.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 expression flickered between confusion, surprise and amusement, before settling into the same fond look the last time Derek had chanced to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, black\u2019s actually the absence of color\u2026but I respect that!\u201d he added, as Derek started to turn away. \u201cYou always look good in it, anyways,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>Derek stared at the pink tips of Stiles\u2019 ears. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t like wearing these suits. I\u2019d wear my leather jacket to work every day if I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cWell <em>there\u2019s</em> a mental image.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek felt himself flush at that, but when Stiles opted for silence and instead leveled him with an expectant and, dare he say <em>fond</em> look, he felt a surge of confidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to have all these suits tailored, and the fittings take forever and it\u2019s still hard to move in them afterwards. I\u2019d much rather just throw on a shirt and jeans and come in to the office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gaped at him. \u201cYou have a <em>tailor</em>? Geez, how much are they paying the financial interns?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek felt jolted by the sudden pang of guilt.</p>\n<p>But per usual, Stiles barreled on. \u201cWell, I hope they pay you well enough if they expect everyone to have enough suits for every day of the week. Those things are <em>expensive</em>. I blew a week and a half\u2019s pay on the potato sack I wore to my aunt Muriel\u2019s third wedding, and really, I should never again complain about how much I make in R&amp;D as long as they don\u2019t care if I show up in flip-flops.\u201d</p>\n<p>The elevator doors opened on the ground floor, and Derek cringed at the <em>fwap-fwap</em> of Stiles\u2019 footwear as he zipped out. He knew H.I. had a company-wide dress code. Derek really needed to have a word with Deaton about adhering to it.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Stiles still stayed later than the rest of the company working on his projects (and Lydia\u2019s, Derek learned unhappily), such that Derek nearly always caught him boarding the elevator around seven.</p>\n<p>Their conversation gradually became <em>conversation</em>, a two-sided thing that made Derek feel both vulnerable and validated at the same time. Stiles let him speak more often than not, even letting the silence sit between them as Derek gathered his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like nature. I wanted to study ecology in college but my family made me choose business\u2026I haven\u2019t seen a forest since I moved to the city.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s the sheriff back home, and when I was a kid I thought he was Batman and I wanted to grow up to bring Justice to the world. With a capital-J.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s called me Der-Der since I was two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom was the first one to start calling me Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026My dad gave me his old Camaro for my sixteenth birthday right before he and my mom died. It\u2019s still sitting in the garage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUp until my mom passed, she bought me model kits of everything \u2013 trains, planes, dinosaurs, you name it. I wanted to be an engineer because of her.\u201d</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Derek was stuck in the office until eight-thirty one night responding to e-mails from their Beijing client.</p>\n<p>When the elevator doors slid open on the twenty-third floor, Stiles was perched in front of them in a rolling chair, his head snapping up from the book propped open in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cI almost thought you\u2019d left already!\u201d Stiles chirped, grabbing his messenger bag and blindly kicking the chair backwards down the hall. It hit the wall and toppled over.</p>\n<p>Stiles cringed. \u201cI\u2019ll get that tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Stiles bounded in, stuffing a post-it note into the book to save his place \u2013 <em>Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, he noted \u2013 Derek tried not to assume that Stiles had waited an hour and a half for a five-minute elevator ride with him\u2026but he\u2019d pretty much just confessed to doing so. It made something in Derek\u2019s chest clench fiercely, and he suddenly wanted nothing more than to reach over and pull Stiles to him.</p>\n<p>Stiles was oblivious to the sentiment. \u201c\u2026I have my performance review tomorrow and I\u2019m kinda sorta really freaking out \u2013 I mean, I really rushed the thermal recycling bulb but I think it turned out okay? I\u2019m not sure, but they totally chewed out Danny and he\u2019s one of the top interns. Like, he went to MIT and US News and World Report says they\u2019re better than Berkeley, where I studied <em>penises</em> and oh God, what if Derek Hale is there?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t going to be. Even though Deaton had requested his presence, he knew he couldn\u2019t go. \u201cStiles,\u201d he commanded, gaze fixed on the manic intern. \u201cDon\u2019t. Panic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stared back, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t panic.\u2019\u201d Derek glanced down at the book in Stiles\u2019 hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you- Did you just reference the Guide? Did you just <em>make a joke</em>?\u201d Stiles spluttered. \u201cOh my god, you did! You closet nerd! I bet you have a towel stuffed in that briefcase-\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek smirked and kept silent. If he seemed smug, it was only because Stiles wasn\u2019t panicking anymore.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>The calm didn\u2019t last long.</p>\n<p>On the last Friday of October, two months after Stiles\u2019 frenzied presence first ingratiated itself into Derek\u2019s monotonous life, the intern burst into the elevator in a flurry of limbs and expletives.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s moving in with <em>Jackson. Jackson</em>, of all people, lord of the douchebags, with his stupid, charming snake-face and his fancy law degree from Harvard. I bet he only got in because his parents bought a freaking building and named it the <em>Admit Our Son or We\u2019ll Ruin You</em> Hall. Did you know he put Scott in a headlock once for asking if Legal hired him for his \u2018Bend and Snap\u2019? We totally fist-pounded over that until Jackson chased me down the hall \u2013 but really, Lydia\u2019s picking <em>that</em>? I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been pining after her for five years, I followed her all the way here from Berkeley, I\u2019ve stayed countless nights working on <em>her</em> projects while she was apparently off rendezvousing with Jackson freaking Whittemore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Five years. Derek didn\u2019t know his crush on the little red-headed engineer was that old. And she\u2019d not only ignored him and strung him along for that long, but <em>used</em> him as well?</p>\n<p>\u201cI give up! I\u2019m gonna- where\u2019s my phone?\u201d Stiles wailed, pulling out his iPhone. \u201cSiri, where\u2019s the nearest animal shelter? I need to adopt some cats. Lots of cats. I might as well accept my fate now and get on with the reclusion and dying alone thing, since the only affection I\u2019ll ever get is of the feline persuasion, and I\u2019ll have to hire someone to deliver groceries to my house too, Siri, because who am I kidding? Cute brainiac girls would never go for someone like <em>me</em>-\u201c</p>\n<p>Something flared in Derek\u2019s mind, furious and possessive. Stiles had <em>no idea</em>. Before he could register what he was doing, Derek had thrown a hand out towards the panel of buttons on the wall, jamming his thumb into the emergency stop.</p>\n<p>Stiles yelped when the entire elevator jolted to a halt, the loud buzz of the alarm overwhelming the room.</p>\n<p>Derek returned Stiles\u2019 open-mouthed stare. He panicked for a split second \u2013 <em>what the hell had he done that for</em> - before deciding <em>fuck it</em> and stepping forward to press his lips against Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 lips were softer than he\u2019d expected\u2026but his lips were frozen against Derek\u2019s, unresponsive and slack-jawed, and Derek\u2019s mind went from <em>oh shit</em> to <em>he\u2019s going to sue me</em> to <em>Hale Industries is going to crash and burn because I have no self-control</em> and <em>I should back away now</em> before Stiles made a desperate noise and wrapped his arms around Derek.</p>\n<p>So he clutched back, hands fisting in that stupid scarlet hoodie, and Stiles sank forward into him until they hit the wall. Derek moaned at the surprising display of strength, a deep rumble in his chest, licking cautiously across the bow of his top lip until Stiles shuddered against him.</p>\n<p>\u2026The feeling of it was something Derek wanted etched in his memory permanently.</p>\n<p>Derek broke off the kiss and dipped his head down to Stiles\u2019 throat, kissing over his rapid pulse and nuzzling into the vibrations of Stiles\u2019 whimpers, reveling in the feel of Stiles\u2019 fingers playing over the nape of his neck.</p>\n<p>The loud gasp of \u201c<em>Derek!</em>\u201d when he slid a leg between Stiles\u2019 nearly undid him, hips bucking forward, and things were about to get a whole lot heavier in the elevator when the blaring alarm suddenly cut off.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mr. Hale</em>,\u201d the tinny voice filtered in through the control panel. \u201c<em>This is Boyd. I see you\u2019ve pressed the emergency stop. Is everything alright?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026The voice sounded mildly amused. Derek spun around, spotting the tiny half-globe of the camera in the corner for the first time. <em>Shit</em>.</p>\n<p>When he turned back around, Stiles was stock-still in his arms, staring at him with a look of abject horror. <em>Shit shit shit</em>.</p>\n<p>Derek closed his eyes and tried to breathe. \u201cYes Boyd, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Okay then, Mr. Hale. We\u2019re working on getting the elevator moving again, but it\u2019ll be a few minutes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Boyd,\u201d Derek forced out.</p>\n<p>The intercom shut off with a click, and Stiles continued staring, eyes full of disbelief, or terror, or <em>betrayal</em>, and silent as Derek had ever seen.</p>\n<p>He was just about to beg him to speak, when Stiles snapped his jaw shut and whispered, \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, <em>you\u2019re</em> Derek Hale?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pursed his lips, and nodded slowly, carefully.</p>\n<p>Stiles made a choking sound. \u201c<em>But your last name is Greenberg!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said that was my badge,\u201d Derek sighed. He couldn\u2019t meet Stiles\u2019 eyes.</p>\n<p>He only finally looked up at the mounting sound of wheezing. Stiles had gone sheet-white, eyes going in and out of focus. Derek reached out to grab Stiles when he started to sway. \u201cStiles! What the hell \u2013 calm down!\u201d he worried, shaking him roughly once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fired! I\u2019m so fired!\u201d Stiles shrieked.</p>\n<p>Derek grimaced. \u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI called you a slave-driver!\u201d Stiles cried hysterically. \u201cI called you an <em>ogre</em>! <em>I stole all the blue paperclips!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raised an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s company property!</em>\u201d he shouted, waving his arms madly in distress.</p>\n<p>Derek ran a hand over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not theft if the vice president of the company gives you permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somehow that sent Stiles into a whole new set of conniptions. \u201cOhmygod I made out with the vice president of the company, <em>Oh my god</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek felt his heart sink. It was one thing to expect Stiles to be amenable to an office relationship between departments\u2026it was another thing to <em>lie</em> to him and then try to involve him in something with extreme legal repercussions. He couldn\u2019t do that to Stiles.</p>\n<p>So that was it. Whatever fantasy Derek had been hopelessly entertaining for the past couple of weeks had come to an end. He only hoped that Stiles could recover from the trauma Derek had clearly inflicted on him, maybe even forgive him some day, if they ever saw each other again.</p>\n<p>Derek took several steps back, as far away as he could get in the confined space. \u201cStiles,\u201d he began, inhaling deeply. \u201cI took\u2026I took advantage of you and I basically lied to you, and it was all, uh, it is all unforgiveable\u2026so I will stay away from you from now on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t expect the look of hurt to sweep across Stiles\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see me anymore?\u201d Stiles whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not-\u201c Dammit, how did Stiles look even <em>more</em> betrayed? \u201cI overstepped my boundaries, I let my feelings cloud my judgment and I should\u2019ve kept your interests-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I already picked the color scheme for our wedding,\u201d Stiles blurted.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face turned crimson. \u201c<em>It\u2019s red and black our favorite colors</em>,\u201d he squeaked, throwing his hands over his mouth.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2026Derek tried to parse out what Stiles was really saying.</p>\n<p>And then he had to double-check, because it made no sense - Stiles liked short, redheaded engineering girls, not scowling, taciturn executives, and oh, Stiles was suffocating himself behind his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like meatball subs?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles let out a long, spluttering exhale as he lowered his hands, the purple slowly draining out of his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like. Meatball subs.\u201d</p>\n<p>He scrunched up his face. \u201cYeah, I guess, how is that-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m headed over to Angelo\u2019s right now to get one, if you\u2019d like to join me.\u201d</p>\n<p>As realization dawned on him, Stiles\u2019 lips curved farther up, until his smile looked like it was going to split his face in half.</p>\n<p>It was the brightest thing Derek had ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Stiles responded, nodding vigorously. \u201cI\u2019d like that- I\u2019d like it a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>He kept on beaming even when the elevator jerkily resumed its descent, and Derek was almost tempted to step forward and kiss him breathless again. Almost.</p>\n<p>The elevator doors slid open on the ground floor, and for the first time, Stiles didn\u2019t run out ahead of him, instead reaching out a tentative hand towards Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek took it with a tight squeeze. Stiles grinned shyly, and led them out into the lobby.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 phone pinged, and he pulled it out with his free hand to check it. \u201cIx-nay on the cats, Siri,\u201d he muttered into the phone, and shoved it back into his pocket.</p>\n<p>Derek smiled.</p>"
