  "text": "<p align=\"left\">The bell rings, class starts, and Katsuki and Midoriya are inexplicably absent. Back in first year, this would have been considered a disaster that was deserving of UA going into full lockdown and a PR backlash that would last for months. Eijirou shivers, remembering the fight at Ground Beta, Katsuki climbing into his bed late at night, face wet with tears, limbs shaking with something Eijirou never wanted anywhere near his boyfriend <em>ever</em>. But it\u2019s second year now, and things have calmed down. The atmosphere in the classroom is\u2026 mildly unsettled, as opposed to reeking of abject panic.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cWhere are problem children one and two,\u201d Aizawa sighs. Eijirou can almost see the new hairs turning grey as the man finishes his headcount coming up two short. They really don\u2019t pay Aizawa-sensei enough. Should they talk to Nedzu about this? Maybe organize an Aizawa-sensei Appreciation Day where they all leave him alone for 24 hours and nobody almost dies/gets kidnapped/destroys the school//harasses the girls\u2013</p>\n<p align=\"left\">He\u2019ll figure out the logistics later.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cBakugo wasn\u2019t in his room this morning,\u201d Eijirou says, eventually. \u201cI thought he was just out running, though\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">His boyfriend runs himself like a military base and it\u2019s equal parts worrying and impressive. Running first thing in the morning, Katsuki has told him, quiets his mind. For someone whose brain is so loud all the time\u2026 Well, Eijirou is glad that he\u2019s found a healthy coping mechanism, even if he does have to lay down the law on how many laps are considered enough and how many laps make his lungs burn just thinking about them.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cYou\u2019re saying you checked?\u201d Denki turns to him, wiggling his eyebrows.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cDude, you know it\u2019s not like that!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">It\u2019s exactly like that.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cAnd Midoriya?\u201d Aizawa swiftly changes the topic with the desperation of a man who has been friends with Present Mic and Midnight long enough for them to break him.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cI heard him leave early this morning,\u201d Tokoyami offers. \u201cA little after sunrise.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cThat\u2019s so early,\u201d Uraraka says, eyes furrowed. \u201cUnless\u2026\u201d she turns to Iida. \u201cDidn\u2019t Deku say he and Bakugo were starting to work on some new combos?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The class is silent as they absorb this new information. Individually, Aizawa\u2019s so-called problem children are more than well-deserving of their names. Together\u2013</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cWe\u2019re fucked,\u201d Denki whispers.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">As if on cue, Midoriya bursts through the door, already babbling apologies. Katsuki strides in behind him, his movements languid, relaxed. Eijirou feels the corners of his lips quirk up, unbidden. Whatever the two of them were working on was going well, if it has Katsuki that calm.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Aizawa drones, but it\u2019s drowned out by the class\u2019 exclamations.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cHoly shit, what happened to you guys?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cDeku, your face!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cBakubro, are you okay, dude? Your arms are shaking\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cGo stick your dick in a blender,\u201d Katsuki bites out, dropping into his seat. Hanta almost looks considering for a moment, before shaking himself out of it.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cI know you love those protein shakes, bro!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u201cIt\u2019s too early for this,\u201d Aizawa-sensei says, finally. \u201cWe will be discussing this later.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, class starts, and Eijirou does his best to pay attention to the progression of hero policy and not his boyfriend who is in desperate need of an arm massage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few minutes before the end of class, Aizawa-turns to Katsuki and Midoriya expectedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidnight supervised us,\u201d Midoriya says, rushed, \u201cShe had prep first and we made sure it was okay with her and we won\u2019t be late again, we\u2019re really sorry about that\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it was training,\u201d Aizawa checks. \u201cThe reason you both look\u2026 like this, is because you\u2019re developing your combo moves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stares at him. \u201cAre you asking if me beating up Deku was safe, sane, and consensual? Because it was safe, sane, and consensual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Denki wheezes. Iida looks like he\u2019s in the beginning stages of a heart attack.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out of my class,\u201d Aizawa monotones, with the eyes of a dead man.</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot fucking win with you assholes,\u201d Katsuki mutters, turning for the door. Behind him, Midoriya\u2019s face is bright pink, but the guy looks ludicrously happy for someone with heavily-charred arm hair. Even with Eijirou\u2019s vague, spotty knowledge of their history, it makes sense. Training with Katsuki is like cliff jumping. He pushes, pushes, pushes until you\u2019re drowning.</p>\n<p>But the <em>fall</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s exhilarating.</p>\n<p>Eijirou isn\u2019t a poet, but he imagines his boyfriend makes him one. Midoriya would understand what he means but, privately, Eijirou thinks, no one will ever fall as fast, as hard as him. When it comes to Katsuki, Eijirou is untameable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, for one, respect a man with good BDSM etiquette,\u201d Denki announces, the minute they\u2019re out of earshot of Aizawa\u2019s disapproving ears. It\u2019s enough to break Eijirou out of his reverie and he laughs, laughs harder when Katsuki lunges at Denki without Eijirou to hold him back.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine. He deserves it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The soft knock on his door that night isn\u2019t unexpected. Eijirou turns to his mirror one last time, smoothes down his shirt before opening the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Katsuki asks, his eyes soft. It does something to Eijirou, knowing that this sweetness, this gentleness, is something special, something reserved for him. He doesn\u2019t have experience with good things, permanent things, but this\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, dumbass,\u201d Katsuki interrupts, one hand cupping his jaw. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired or whatever we don\u2019t need to\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Eijirou snaps out of it. \u201cI\u2019m all good, I just\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> I just really love you. I just can\u2019t believe how lucky I am to have you. I just want to have this forever and, for the first time, I think that I might actually get to.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013got distracted! But I\u2019m good now, dude, promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki huffs a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their footsteps are quiet as they sneak out of the dorms, past the gates, and out into the streets of the city. Eijirou reaches out for Katsuki\u2019s hand and the weight of it is warm and familiar. Nights like these are the reason why their relationship is a secret. He\u2019s not ashamed of Katsuki, never could be, and it\u2019s taken a while but he knows Katsuki feels the same about him. It\u2019s just that their world is so <em> public </em>, between their friends, the school, the media, and their burgeoning careers. It\u2019s nice to have something to keep for themselves.</p>\n<p>He echoes this last statement out loud and Katsuki hums in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m craving mochi,\u201d Eijirou offers delicately, eyes fixed straight ahead, as they turn the corner towards the nearest 7-11.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m with fucking Round Face,\u201d Katsuki says, huffing, but his hand still squeezes Eijirou\u2019s because half the reason why he and Uraraka have become such great friends despite her cemented place in the Izucrew is that they both absolutely love the sweet treat (although nobody is quite on Uraraka\u2019s level.) Then, \u201cIf you suggest getting fucking lame-ass packaged ramen, I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s the super spicy version?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially then, asshole, it\u2019s a fucking insult.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou is still laughing when they leave the conbini, arms laden down with mochi and caramel corn and spicy squid chips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Eijirou starts, \u201cmaybe you\u2019ve got more in common with Uraraka than just the mochi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises an eyebrow. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou grins. \u201cWell, you both have super soft cheeks, and near the end of training, they get really pink\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to explode your fucking caramel corn if you don\u2019t stop right now at this fucking instant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s exploded corn already, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to fucking find out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, bro, we should totally try that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry what? Me exploding your fucking food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo like, making popcorn! If I hardened my hands around some kernels and you like, exploded them! We could make popcorn!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a contemplating silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought about it for a second there,\u201d Eijirou prods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking about pushing you into the fucking street,\u201d Katsuki replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any cars out, what would even be the point?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki growls. \u201cIt\u2019s the fucking <em> principle </em> of the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A giggle builds up in Eijrou\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re such a nerd, babe.\u201d</p>\n<p>His boyfriend turns to him, his eyes bright and so, so beautiful. \u201cYeah? This is big coming from the guy who can recite the location and purpose of every fucking muscle in the human body. The guy who remembers the dates and details of every Crimson Riot fight. The guy who forgot to come down for dinner yesterday because he was too busy designing our hero agency\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s said it, but it falls out of him with the same desperation. Katsuki stops. Flushes that soft, pretty pink that has Eijirou wrapped around his pinky finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking gay.\u201d He squeezes Eijirou\u2019s hand. \u201cI love you so much too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou grins. \u201cSee? Nerd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Oh my fucking god </em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou? Kirishima?\u201d</p>\n<p>They both freeze. On the other side of the crosswalk is one of the second-year Business students, Kobayashi Aia. Her sharp eyes have already picked up the hundred suspicious things about the scene; their interlaced fingers, their matching blushes, their faces that are so, so close. Hearing Red Riot saying \u201cI love you so much\u201d to someone who replies in kind. Having that someone be the Beast of 1-A, Ground Zero. Eijirou can\u2019t say \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like\u201d because it <em>is</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t tell anyone we saw you out here,\u201d Katsuki says. Eijirou turns and his heart breaks because his boyfriend is so tense, so nervous, and his grip on Eijirou\u2019s hand is near-crushing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell anyone you saw us. Deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kobayashi nods, slowly. She starts to cross, and so they do as well. The air is colder than it was a minute ago but at his side, Bakugo is warm, and it\u2019s enough to keep Eijirou from drowning.</p>\n<p>It all goes to shit so quickly.</p>\n<p>In front of them, the harsh lights of a convertible glow, the engine loud and bright. The driver either doesn\u2019t see them or is going too fast too stop, and the noise of it all is deafeningly terrifying. Eijirou hardens on impact, pushing Kobayashi behind him, while Katsuki drags both of them out of the way. As quick as it had appeared, the car passes them, leaving ugly skid marks on the asphalt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Katsuki mutters, before turning to Kobayashi. \u201cAre you okay? Does anything hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Look how much you\u2019ve grown</em>, Eijirou thinks, fondly. This Katsuki that immediately checks on the civilian in the wake of an incident makes a beautiful contrast to the one that had failed his first Provisional License Exam on account of a horrifying bedside manner. Eijirou had loved him then, but now\u2026 <em> You\u2019re amazing. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Ei, she\u2019s right here,\u201d Katsuki hisses, his voice stuttery and breaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kobayashi inhales. \u201cOh no\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to, I was just so scared and I lost control\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Eijirou reassures, despite his heart spiking. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy quirk,\u201d Kobayashi mumbles miserably, looking at the ground. \u201cWhen I\u2026 release it on two people, they can hear each others\u2019 thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. That explains why his boyfriend is currently the colour of a cherry tomato.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long will it last?\u201d Eijirou asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAround two weeks, give or take a few days,\u201d Kobayashi says, exhaling shakily. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I completely understand if you tell the teachers.\u201d She groans, smacking herself in the face. \u201cI just wanted some ice cream, how did this end up happening? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop fucking apologizing,\u201d Bakugo rumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, we\u2019re all fucking okay, everything\u2019s fucking fine or whatever.\u201d <em> If it has to be anyone, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s Eijirou.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Eijirou looks down at him, grinning. \u201cAww Katsuki, you really mean that?\u201d</p>\n<p>His boyfriend groans. \u201cShut the fuck up. Shut the fuck <em> up </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looooove me. You have a cruuuuush on me. You wanna share your super gay thooooughts with me~\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have moved out of the way,\u201d Katsuki sighs, hauling Kobayashi up. \u201cI should have let that fucking asshole hit us, honestly, a broken back would be better than this.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Masochist</em>, Eijirou thinks and, in the second right before Katsuki chokes and focuses intensely on salvaging what's left of their midnight haul, he realizes that this might be a problem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kobayashi explains the rest on their way back to Heights Alliance. It\u2019s not a constant stream of thoughts, but the more prominent feelings, words, and ideas will make themselves known. Dreams and nightmares can be shared occasionally, but it\u2019s not an absolute rule. Distance shouldn\u2019t have an impact. If they practice, they can probably shut the other out with minimal discomfort.</p>\n<p>By the time he and Katsuki are back on their floor, Eijirou thinks he\u2019ll be able to handle this.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay with this? I know privacy is a big thing with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> He\u2019s so caring what the fuck, how is he still thinking about how I feel, I love him so much how fucking dare he be this easy to love? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Eijirou sniffles. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be this gay for the whole two weeks I\u2019m not going to be able to make it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slams shut in his face.</p>\n<p>Moments later, when Eijirou is lying down, ready to go to sleep, he feels a <em> Goodnight, I love you</em>, <em> even if you\u2019re a shithead </em>and he hopes Katsuki can feel the luminous happiness that consumes him.</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m so lucky</em>, he thinks. <em> So, incredibly lucky. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is the unluckiest bastard alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His joint training with Deku wasn\u2019t a total fucking dumpster fire, they were patching up their relationship, he and Eijirou were going strong, none of the nosy, hobbyless chucklefucks they called their friends had found them out\u2026 All things considered, he should have expected this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ever since the Sports Festival in their first year, he\u2019s been training with Shinsou to block off his mind. He picks up the mental exercises that Kobayashi explains faster; by all accounts, he should be able to close that door. Hide himself from Eijirou, and lock him out in return.</p>\n<p>He just can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Hearing Eijirou\u2019s thoughts is like having his ear pressed up against his boyfriends\u2019 solid chest and hearing his steady heartbeat. It\u2019s reassuring, to have the warmth of it grounding him throughout the day. Something strong, to lead him through. A mental version of Eijirous\u2019 Unbreakable in his mind; a protector.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima, dude, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him, Eijirou\u2019s eyes are wide as he tries to choke down his rice. Sparky gleefully takes the opportunity to whack him on the back.</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot, drink some water,\u201d Katsuki grumbles, pushing a glass in his direction. Eijirou looks at him with watery eyes and Katsuki does his best to pretend the tears are because of the choking and not because of the massive amounts of sappiness his boyfriend had just borne witness to. He is Bakugo Katsuki, future Number One Pro Hero, he has a fucking <em>reputation </em>and now all of that is going up in smoke. Here lies Katsuki, he died as he lived, disgustingly sappy to the point that it fucking killed him because he\u2019s a loser and deserves a losers\u2019 death.</p>\n<p><em> I love you so much, </em> Eijirou thinks. <em> Do you know how cute you are? It should be illegal. </em></p>\n<p><em> Shut the fuck up</em>, Katsuki replies. <em> I abhor you. </em></p>\n<p>Eijirou smiles and Katsukis\u2019 eye catches it.</p>\n<p>\n<em> His smile is so fucking beautiful. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cKiri, dude, seriously, you\u2019ve gotta start eating slower!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite Kobayashi\u2019s assurances, they make the decision to keep the secret from Aizawa. Explaining their predicament would mean explaining why they were out in the first place and, while Katsuki doesn\u2019t give two shits about whether or not his teacher knows he\u2019s in a relationship, he refuses to get in trouble over a fucking mochi craving, of all things.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not Round Cheeks. He\u2019s <em>not</em>.</p>\n<p>Beside him, Eijirou does a poor job of hiding his laughter. Katsuki is not the only one who notices this.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima!\u201d Present Mic calls from the front of the room. \u201cWould you mind sharing what you find so funny to the rest of the class!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just thinking about that story you told us about Aizawa-sensei, sir,\u201d Eijirou responds, smoothly.</p>\n<p>Present Mic preens. \u201cBaby Eraser was hilarious, I agree. Still think he could stand to loosen up sometimes, but things take time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a fond look in his eyes, Katsuki realizes. Fuck, is Present Mic in love with Aizawa? Are they together? They\u2019re old as fuck, are they <em> married? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki I\u2019m begging you to stop,\u201d Eijirou murmurs, his voice strained.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He loves his idiot so much. If there\u2019s one good thing about this whole thing, it\u2019s that Eijirou knows, now, wholeheartedly. Katsuki\u2019s not good with words, can\u2019t express just how much of his world revolves around Eijirou but now, it\u2019s been made embarrassingly clear. It would be humiliating if he didn\u2019t love him so much. If some part of him wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly glad for it to be made transparently obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei, can I go to the bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo right ahead, listener!\u201d</p>\n<p>His boyfriends\u2019 face is so, so red. It\u2019s the cutest fucking thing Katsuki\u2019s ever seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, I hope Kiri\u2019s okay,\u201d Mina whispers from behind him. \u201cHe\u2019s been off since yesterday. Do you think something\u2019s happened?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Your friends are worried about you</em>, Katsuki thinks.</p>\n<p>\n<em> This is all your fault. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shitty Hair it\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re a fucking homosexual. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I hate you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Pause.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Tell them I\u2019m nervous about the math test. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbass is nervous about the fucking math test later,\u201d Katsuki grumbles. \u201cIf he gets below an 80 they\u2019re never going to find his body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, look at you being a supportive boyfriend,\u201d Raccoon Eyes coos. \u201cKiri\u2019s so lucky to have you, Bakugou!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will pull out your toenails and stick them in your mouth.\u201d <em> I\u2019m the lucky one</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<em> KATSUKI, PLEASE! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eijirou is trying so, so hard not to burst into flames every time Katsuki looks at him, but it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult. How could anyone not know we\u2019re together, he wonders, when he looks at me like that? His boyfriend is many things, but subtle isn\u2019t one of them. Maybe their class is just cripplingly oblivious? That\u2019s\u2026 not a great trait to have in so many of Japan\u2019s rising heroes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPot meet kettle,\u201d Katsuki mutters, capping his eyeliner.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need help with your mask?\u201d Eijirou asks, because one of them might as well showcase regular, romantic, non-asshole behaviour.</p>\n<p>\n<em> I thought you said me being all sappy and shit was killing you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Only because I\u2019m not used to it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki looks up at Eijirou and his eyes are so wide, so vulnerable; Eijirou can see the little golden flecks in his iris and it reminds him of victory.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should say it more, then,\u201d Katsuki says, softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d Eijirou replies. He\u2019s not lying. Katsuki shows love in his actions and it\u2019s one of the reasons why Eijirou loves him. Cooking his favourite meals, patiently reviewing concepts, sneaking out at midnight; Katsuki doesn\u2019t have anything to prove. Not to him. Not to someone who understands him the way he is, loves him the way he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf my eyeliner runs, I\u2019m going to shank you in your sleep.\u201d The threat would be scarier if Katsuki didn\u2019t stutter his way through it.</p>\n<p>Eijirou gasps, because his asshole boyfriend is rubbing off on him. \u201cBabe, did I make you cry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Katsuki growls, shoving him out of the way. \u201cFucking control yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re the last ones out of the locker room and Eijirou resolutely ignores the wide, Cheshire Cat grins from Denki, Hanta, and Mina. It\u2019s nice to have supportive friends, but he shies away from imagining how enthusiastic they would be if they found out that he and Katsuki are actually a couple. It\u2019s daunting. To be this vulnerable in his head, with Katsuki, really isn\u2019t difficult. To showcase his heart so boldly, to everyone around him, is another thing entirely.</p>\n<p>As the thought gains traction in his head, Eijirou feels a wave of something buttery and comforting wash over him. It feels like stepping into a warm shower after a workout, the hot water running over him, reaching every dip and corner, soothing his aching muscles and relieving his skin. It feels like Katsuki. He turns. His boyfriend is all tense shoulders and furrowed brows, but there\u2019s a certain looseness in his hands that tell Eijirou all he needs to know.</p>\n<p>\n<em> I love you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Love you more. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fighting in pairs today,\u201d Aizawa announces. He sighs, looking like he would rather be decomposing in a landfill overrun by raccoons than speaking to his class. \u201cI\u2019m allowing you to choose your partners.\" The class looks warily between Katsuki and Midoriya. They\u2019re unpredictable at worst, unbeatable at best. Eijirou feels the excitement thrumming in his chest, excited to see what his boyfriend had come up with\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima.\u201d Katsuki is looking at him, something sharp and dangerous in his grin. <em> We\u2019re going to wipe the fucking floor with the rest of these extras. </em></p>\n<p>Eijirou feels that same sharpness in the pit of his stomach and bares his teeth. <em> Fuck yeah. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is extremely unsettling,\u201d Todoroki says. No one disagrees with him.</p>\n<p>Eijirou almost feels bad. Almost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are in the presence of demons, reborn,\u201d Tokoyami solemnly declares. A sore, groaning, wishing-they-were-dead Class 2-A agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like they were one person,\u201d Uraraka whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Kacchan move like that with someone else before,\u201d Midoriya mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to France,\u201d Aoyama groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone go get changed,\u201d Aizawa says, his voice embarrassingly close to something resembling amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei, please,\u201d Denki whines. \u201cHave some sympathy for the broken, the beaten, and the damned.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Eijirou thinks Aizawa-sensei looks torn between painstakingly making a Denki skinsuit and zipping himself up in his sleeping bag until he suffocates. Katsuki chokes and tries his pass it off as a cough. The end product is enough to make Yaomomo look steps away from offering him her fancy, significantly-higher-tax-bracket tea.</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t get sick. No, he thinks Eijirou\u2019s <em>funny</em>.</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m breaking up with you</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima and Bakugou, stay behind. Those who join them will be forced to fight them. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somehow, Kaminari Denki, the broken, beaten, and damned, finds it in himself to sprint to the locker room, wailing in pain the whole way. The rest of the class follows him, though with noticeably more dignity.</p>\n<p>Without the rest of their classmates to shoulder the weight of it, Aizawa\u2019s gaze cuts through Eijirous\u2019 composure like a particularly disgruntled kitchen knife.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould either of you like to explain to me what I just saw?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d Katsuki replies, staunchly.</p>\n<p>Aizawa turns to him. Thank you, kitchen knife, Eijirou praises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki stomps on his foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter class,\u201d he continues. \u201cDuring weekends. On our own time. Our quirks are compatible as fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe work well together,\u201d Eijirou says, trying to unstick his voicebox from his intestines. \u201cAnd we figured out some super cool things that we can do, together, and we\u2019re going to make this work, we\u2019re going to go Plus Ultra\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>His teacher squints at him. \u201cHow long have you been working on this?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThree months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too long.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> We\u2019re telepathic, </em> Eijirou despairs<em>, how did we fuck that up. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been planning it out for three months,\u201d he stumbles, \u201cbut we\u2019ve only started actually training for the last few weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa-sensei looks up at the ceiling like he\u2019s begging it to come crashing down on him. Eijirou can relate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two did well today,\u201d he says, finally. \u201cIf you need any help, or ideas for strategies, my door is open.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, sensei,\u201d Eijirou says. Katsuki echoes him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease go change,\u201d Aizawa-sensei says, sounding like he\u2019s on the verge of tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sensei,\u201d they chorus.</p>\n<p>Eijirou wonders how stupid the two of them look, two hero students powerwalking away from a man who has to depuff his eyebags before weighing himself at the doctors\u2019 office.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo fucking stupid,\u201d Katsuki groans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it was worth it,\u201d Eijirou says.</p>\n<p>Katsuki turns to him, eyes blazing. \u201cSo fucking worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They settle into the whole thing, after that. Eijirou thinks about his moms, their movie nights, how competitive their family game nights would get. Katsuki pretends something in the cracked Wii remote that is his heart doesn\u2019t melt. Eijirou suggests he come over sometime. Katsuki says okay.</p>\n<p>In Ectoplasm\u2019s class, Eijirou zones out during the lesson, letting Katsuki's voice explain the concepts to him instead. When he's called on, he actually gets the answer right! Ectoplasm says, \u201cCorrect, Kirishima,\u201d a series of sounds nobody has ever heard from the math teacher before. (Katsuki is <em> spoiled </em>that night.)</p>\n<p>During lunch, Katsuki looks out the windows. The sun tugs at something inside him and he remembers the days he used to spend hiking with his dad, the two of them climbing in silence, breaking the calm to point out vibrant leaves, rare bird species, a riveting snail shell.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It sounds nice</em>, says Eijirou. He feels the switch in the energy, the nervous tick, Katsuki's tense inhale, the wanting so heartbreakingly sweet\u2013</p>\n<p>\n<em> Mind taking me along sometime? </em>\n</p>\n<p>And Katsuki exhales. Thinks that maybe this quirk is good for some things. Dispels the thought as soon as he thinks it. The only real constant in Katsuki\u2019s happiness is Kirishima Eijirou.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They start practicing on the weekends, in their spare time. Neither of them likes lying to their homeroom teacher and both of them are determined to maintain their impossible synergy, quirk or no quirk. Katsuki always wins. Eijirou is unshakeable. Together, they bring down the sky.</p>\n<p>Their class congratulates them. Kobayashi stops looking terrified every time they make eye contact. Things start settling.</p>\n<p>Katsuki and Eijirou have never been good at settling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Depending on who you ask, everything comes around in either the sweetest way or the most humiliating way. Eijirou will always see it as a memory shrouded in rose petals and honey. If Katsuki drinks enough white wine, then exactly two cosmos, and has been awake for over 24 hours prior, he might admit something similar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What happens is this:</p>\n<p>It is Saturday morning and Eijirou is still blinking sleep from his eyes as he sleepily shuffles into the common room. Midoriya and Iida discuss a comic book series in the corner and Uraraka, Tsuyu, and Yaomomo are engrossed in a braiding chain in front of the sofa. Shouji and Tokoyami play cards at the table. Jirou reads quietly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s peaceful.</p>\n<p>Eijirou grins at his friends, pads past them towards the kitchen. Looks up. Has the breath knocked out of him.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s cracking eggs into the pan, mentally humming a song Eijirous\u2019 been singing non-stop, just to see if it would stick. He looks soft and snug in the hoodie he\u2019d stolen back in first year, once it had outgrown Eijirou but not his own smaller frame. His arms are steady and sure as he flips the tamagoyaki, the smell of it already mouthwatering. There are enough for two, Eijirou notices. Katsuki is cooking for him too.</p>\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s the culmination of all those things. Katsuki, always enduring. Katsuki, wearing his clothes. Katsuki, always thinking of Eijirou. Katsuki, looking like something perfect, something otherworldly, something exquisite. <em> I want to come home to him for the rest of my life</em>, Eijirou thinks. <em> He\u2019s it for me. My Symbol of Victory. My reminder to breathe. The love of my life. Bakugou Katsuki. </em></p>\n<p>What happens is this:</p>\n<p>Katsuki turns off the stove and is very, very still. Eijirou only registers a shocked silence, before his boyfriend raises his fist to his mouth, attempting to muffle a choked sob.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt? Did you burn yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Katsuki whispers. There are tears tracing their way down his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eijirou can\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em> baby</em>,\u201d he murmurs, wrapping his boyfriend in his arms. \u201cIs this because of\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki drops into him with a shaky breath, seemingly forgetting their wide-eyed, drop-jawed audience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fucking asshole,\u201d he says. \u201cYou make me feel so\u2013 so\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> So loved. You make me feel so goddamn loved and I want to spend the rest of my fucking life making you feel the same way. I want to open a fucking hero agency together and become number one together and challenge each other every day of our lives and I want to come home to you, at the end of it all. I want to build a fucking house together, with room for your million and one weights and all my knives. I want to be home for you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Eijirou breathes. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d It doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Nothing he could say to Katsuki will ever be enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cEi,\u201d Katsuki says, \u201cyou just made me fucking cry because of how fucking gay you are. Stop with that bullshit. Everything you do is enough for me. More than enough, even, you fucking overcompensater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you understand, right?\u201d Eijirou checks. \u201cYou understand how much I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki kisses him, soft and sweet. \u201cBelieve me, Ei,\u201d he says, the words dripping with fondness. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it impossible for me to ever fucking forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later:</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me recap, for everyone whose brain just melted out of their ears,\u201d Mina chirps. \u201cYou two,\u201d she turns, stabs two aggressive \u201cI\u2019m-Watching-You\u201d fingers at Eijirou and Katsuki, \u201care fucking telepathic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have <em> been </em> telepathic for the past week and have told <em> none </em>of us, choosing instead to annihilate us without mercy and have Aizawa-sensei think you\u2019re actually practicing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop blaming us for the fact that you fucking suck,\u201d Katsuki snaps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, we have started practicing,\u201d Eijirou sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, you\u2019re telepathic, you have no say,\u201d Mina argues. The class agrees with her. Vocally. With anger. Katsuki\u2019s pretty sure three-fifths of the fucking idiot parade is the reason why theres a giant intervention banner strung across the common room. Ponytail is selling \u201cI\u2019ve Been Personally Betrayed By KRBK\u201d buttons. He doesn\u2019t know what KRBK stands for and does not fucking want to.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd moving past the telepathy thing, which, again, <em> what the fuck</em>,\u201d Jirou interjects. \u201cYou have been dating since fucking <em>first year</em>. And didn\u2019t tell <em> anyone </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we just wanted privacy\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, no, what the fuck,\u201d Katsuki says. And again, \u201c<em>what the fuck. </em> Sure, we didn\u2019t tell any of you zero-IQ pussyfooters but how much more fucking obvious does it need to be? Asshole grabbed my hand at Kamino! We sleep in the same fucking bed half the time. Sometimes we eat lunch alone in the goddamn courtyard. <em> I cook for this fucking shithead. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou call each other bro and dude all the time!\u201d Denki wails.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI also have fucking hickeys because I\u2019m dating a goddamn shark furry does that scream bromance to you?\u201d </em>Bakugo yells.</p>\n<p>\u201cShark furry,\u201d Hanta wheezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHickeys?\u201d Deku asks.</p>\n<p>\n<em> This is why I didn\u2019t want to have any fucking friends.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Babe, I can hear your inner monologue first-naming them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I take it back, I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life with you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTHEY\u2019RE DOING IT AGAIN!\u201d Mina shrieks. The room erupts with noise and Katsuki decides that he has had <em>enough</em>. By the small smile on Eijirous\u2019 face, his boyfriend knows exactly where this is going and, Katsuki smirks, is overwhelmingly okay with it.</p>\n<p>They both stand up and the room goes quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Eijirou. \u201cWe\u2019ll be telepathic for the next week. We\u2019ll be dating for\u2026 much longer than that.\u201d He winces. \u201cHonestly, we\u2019re not really sorry about not telling you, being a secret was kind of fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will now be going upstairs to have sex,\u201d Katsuki deadpans. \u201cIf you follow us I will throw you out the window. Don\u2019t attempt to contact us for the next three hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Three hours </em>?\u201d Shinsou hisses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right as the elevator door opens, Aizawa-sensei\u2019s dark, deadened, blunt kitchen knife voice reaches all twenty students of 2-A.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will pretend to have heard none of that. However, rest assured that we will be having a conversation and Mondays\u2019 lesson will cover <em> discretion </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki flushes. Eijirou blanches.</p>\n<p>The rest of 2-A stares at the wall as if they are each of them Edward Cullen and the neutral paint is the beautiful shell of an effervescent snail. Twenty students and one teacher stand in a soul-sucking silence, until they hear the faintest sound of a door slamming.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree-hour field trip,\u201d Aizawa sighs. \u201cEverybody out.\u201d</p>"
