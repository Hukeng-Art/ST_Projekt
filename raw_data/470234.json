  "summary": "<p>Derek and Stiles switch bodies because of wizard reasons and Stiles just wants to know what that awesome scent is.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Once again, thanks to Ro and Andrea for cheering me on and keeping me cheerful, and Dizzzylu for being an even more amazing beta than usual, since she had to face this before I even gave it a proper first edit. This was written as a fill for a prompt at the Teen Wolf Kink Meme and is set in the nebulous 'future' where stuff isn't so shitty and wizard bones are the worst thing they have to face.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cNo, seriously, <em>what </em>is that <em>smell</em><em>?</em>\u201d<br><br>\nStiles sniffs at the air above his computer screen, sure he looks stupid but also sure he doesn\u2019t care, since it\u2019s not his body he\u2019s looking stupid in. And no, <em>seriously</em>. Whatever it is, it\u2019s awesome. All warm and spicy and... green? Is green a scent?<br><br>\n\u201cHey, Derek, is green a scent?\u201d<br><br>\nSacked out on the bed behind him, Derek grumbles.<br><br>\nYeah, it takes a lot of energy to be a Stiles, and Derek isn\u2019t doing all that well with it.<br><br>\nLike, at all.<br><br>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to sleep yet, man, it\u2019s barely five. You\u2019ll screw up my body rhythms. And I have the worst nightmares during naps, just fyi.\u201d<br><br>\nBoy, and how weird is that? They\u2019d switched minds or spirits or whatever, Stiles doesn\u2019t like to think about it because words like \u2018soul\u2019 start coming up and no, okay? Just no. They\u2019d switched minds but their actual brain masses had stayed firmly inside their respective skulls, which evidently meant that they got to dream each others\u2019 dreams now, too, along with living each others\u2019 lives.<br><br>\nIf Stiles never dream-eats another dream-antelope again, it\u2019ll be too damn soon. And then there\u2019s the dreams with fire, horrific enough that Stiles is pretty sure they\u2019ll come along with him if he ever gets his body back.<br><br><em>When</em><em>.</em><br><br><em>When </em>he ever gets his body back.<br><br>\nHoly fuck, none of the if and all of the when.<br><br>\nBecause if he was lying a teeny bit to Peter Hale about not wanting the bite, he is <em>sure </em>of it now. He does not want the bite, he does not want to be a werewolf, he wants to be out of this mind-of-its-own body and back in his own now, now, foot stomp, now.<br><br>\nGod, this <em>town</em>. Where else, right? Where else would picking up a fucking bone in a forest equal Freaky Fur-day? Where else would wizards think it was humorous to just leave their own humeruses laying around for anyone to find?<br><br>\nWhere else would <em>wizards</em>.<br><br>\nYeah. That\u2019s a thing.<br><br>\nWizards.<br><br>\nWizards who are <em>assholes</em>.<br><br>\nAnd now because of some Merlin wannabe, he gets to spend the rest of who knows how long inside Derek Hale\u2019s body. And with Derek inside <em>his </em>body. Which, irony, because how often had he thought about that before, with slightly dirtier implications? Too often.<br><br>\nAnd yet never often enough.<br><br>\nSo yeah. It\u2019s been hell, so far.<br><br>\nStiles would never admit it, but Derek has the worst of it between them. Stiles only has to control the urge to flip out and kill people here and there. Derek has to go to<em> high school</em>. Derek has to get detentions and suck at lacrosse and occasionally fall down to keep the world convinced that it\u2019s Stiles in there. Derek has to hug the Sheriff (\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes you <em>do</em>. You hug him or I shave you, so not kidding.\u201d). Derek has to <em>mow the lawn</em>.<br><br>\nHave you seen the Hale house? Outdoor maintenance is not a priority.<br><br>\nNot that Stiles isn\u2019t having a rough time, too. All these fancy werewolf instincts are easy enough to learn about at a distance, researching for Scott and all, but actually having them? So. Shitty. The urge to run, the urge to fight, to howl and hunt and stalk and hump. He doesn\u2019t know if that last one is mostly his teenage-boy mind on werewolf or if it\u2019s more because of Derek\u2019s body, but it is just every form of inconvenient either way.<br><br>\nHe can\u2019t even jerk off because it\u2019s not his damn dick. An injustice so unfair that Stiles has given into the lesser sin of coveting just to try and balance out the universe. Coveting, in this case, means getting all the eyeful he can get his hands on whenever he has an excuse to get Derek\u2019s body naked. He\u2019s been taking a lot of showers, lately. Sometimes two in a row. One warm shower for the ogling of the abs and the, uh, goods (the <em>very </em>goods) and one cold one for the de-arousing afterward.<br><br>\nAnd that\u2019s so not the worst of it.<br><br>\nNo, really. The absolute worst of it had been when he\u2019d seen Mr. Argent a few days ago, giving Stiles-in-Derek the hairy eyeball in a thankfully populated street, and Stiles had found himself wanting to bite him and grind all up on him at the same time. What. No. What? No! If this is what it\u2019s like being a werewolf, every no. He has no idea how they all do it.<br><br>\nOh, and speaking of \u2018they\u2019, is he ever glad he didn\u2019t have to convince any of the pack that he was Derek. It probably would\u2019ve been impossible anyway, even if Stiles hadn\u2019t totally spaced out when he caught their scents and ended up starting a drugged out pack-haze touch-fest, nuzzling into their necks and crawling all over them while Derek tried to explain the whole mind swap thing. Going by the way they all turned from shocked to just as blissed out and touchy as Stiles was, he figures Derek must control the fuck out of that instinct and not let it out to play very often. Or ever.<br><br>\nWhich is silly, because the parts of that day that weren\u2019t killer embarrassing (he\u2019s pretty sure Isaac came in his pants and he\u2019s definitely sure Scott bathed him with his tongue) were <em>awesome</em>. And Derek needs some awesome in his life. A thing that Stiles would have told him if he hadn\u2019t run away after the explaining part, like some... running awayer.<br><br>\nMaybe humans and pack pseudo-orgies don\u2019t mix.<br><br>\nSince then, Stiles has been spending most of his time either here or at Casa de Werewolf, turning his brain to mush and his eyes into dry little balls of agony while trying to figure out how to fix them. Werewolf eyeballs are inconveniently sensitive to the light of computer screens. Handy, huh? All roads have led to nowhere, so far, except for a quick conversation with Dr. Deaton that ended with some borrowed books, an \u2018I\u2019ll look into it\u2019 and an assessing look that made Stiles think of rabbits in labs and fleeing the premises.<br><br>\nOf course, Derek is no help. What time he doesn\u2019t spend Stilesing, he spends recuperating from Stilesing and occasionally enjoying the novelty of homework.<br><br>\nOh wait, no, that\u2019s right, he makes <em>Stiles </em>do the all the homework still. Ha ha ha.<br><br>\nAsshat can wrestle with the lawn mower and his father\u2019s confused, hurt faces for <em>eternity </em>for all Stiles cares.<br><br>\nExcept no, of course not.<br><br>\nBut at the same time, yes.<br><br>\nBecause here Stiles is subjecting his stupid werewolf eyes to yet more asshole wizard research while Derek snoozes on the bed like he owns it or something.<br><br>\n\u201cHey, furball, I mean it!\u201d Stiles twists in his chair, throwing a balled up piece of paper at Derek\u2019s Stiles-shaped skull. Boom, headshot, thank you werewolf vision. \u201cNo napping! Wake up and tell me if any of this sounds even remotely plausible. Because I can\u2019t be certain, but I\u2019m pretty sure licking tree stumps isn\u2019t going to help us.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek\u2019s bare feet roll and stretch where they hang off the side of the bed, their current owner grunting himself awake. \u201cYour teacher is an asshole.\u201d Funny how he manages to sound sexy like that, voice all sleep-rough deep, where Stiles usually just sounds like he\u2019s got a head cold.<br><br>\n\u201cWho?\u201d Stiles loses the thread of the conversation for a second as another wave of that green-spice smell breezes over him. It\u2019s been following him around since this all started last week and if he doesn\u2019t figure out what it is soon, he\u2019s going to flip out. \u201cOh, what, Harris? What\u2019d he do to me now? To you.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek is silent for a moment, frowning at the ceiling. \u201cHe\u2019s just an asshole. He kept singling me out.\u201d He heaves himself up, slumping on the edge of the bed and rubbing his hands vigorously over the short stubble of his hair. \u201cAnd he called you stupid.\u201d He speaks it into his chest, low and muffled enough that Stiles probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear it with his own ears.<br><br>\n\u201cUh, you also call me stupid?\u201d Like seriously, pot on kettle judgements all over the place here.<br><br>\nDerek looks up, palms still curved over his skull. He\u2019s wearing that Derek look of pouty, angry affront. It\u2019s super disconcerting on Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Whatever, Stiles doesn\u2019t have enough spare brain cells to ask about the logic there, not when there are tree stumps to read about and smells to pinpoint. He shifts back and shoves his head under the desk, hunting the scent. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s always been that way, you\u2019ll tune it out. Oh hey, or-\u201d His scalp skims the edge of the desk as he pulls up with a mischievous (or terrifyingly toothy, depending on who you ask) grin. \u201cWe could bring your face to visit him if you want, put the fear of Hale into him?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek gives him a level look (with a touch of sarcasm, because that\u2019s how Stiles\u2019 face works). \u201cNo. You don\u2019t have enough control yet. If he pisses you off, you might hurt him.\u201d<br><br>\nStiles shrugs and rolls his chair away from the desk with a kick, sniffing at the air. \u201cFine, I was just offering.\u201d Whatever, Derek\u2019s the one that has to deal with Harris. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019d have more control if you, you know-\u201d He waves a floppy arm of accusation. \u201c-helped me? Hooked me up with tickets to AlphaCon 2012? Seminars. Pack Orgies And You. Proper Care And Maintenance of a Nemesis. Current Best Practices in Discovering What The <em>Hell That Smell Is</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek growls, sharp frustration pulling him to his feet. Or, well, Stiles thinks that was a growl. Filtered through a human throat it came out more like a whiny groan with a stutter in it, but hey, points for effort.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s <em>just </em>a smell, Stiles. Ignore it!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is not \u2018just\u2019 a smell. Cheese is just a smell. Rain is just a smell. This is.. this is unignorable. It\u2019s everywhere! Is this just how the world smells to your nose? Because you\u2019d think it\u2019d be a mood lifter.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd yet you won\u2019t stop complaining about it.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, because I don\u2019t know what it is! Come on, you have to have some idea. Green? Spice? Greenspice? Does any of this sound familiar?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek turns away, shoulders doing that high scrunch thing that always leaves Stiles\u2019 back tight and sore. \u201cWhat does it even matter?\u201d He picks a book off the pile on Stiles\u2019 nightstand, one of the ones they\u2019d borrowed from Dr. Deaton, and waves it over his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more important things to worry about.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWe?\u201d Because it hasn\u2019t been ninety percent Stiles doing all the heavy eye work. Nope, \u2018we\u2019 have more imp- Wait.<br><br>\nStiles knows those shoulders, and what sort of feelings set them off. And his fuzzy superpowers are telling him he knows what the rise in Derek\u2019s heartbeat and the tiny changes in his voice mean, too. \u201cOh you deflecting assmunch, you totally know what it is, I can hear it!\u201d<br><br>\nIf anything, Derek\u2019s back tenses up further. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. All you\u2019re hearing is me getting pissed off because you won\u2019t drop it.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHa! No. No way. I can recognize angry-Derek just fine, thanks. Lots of little points of data to compare, there. You are <em>totally </em>lying and you\u2019re gonna tell me, or I\u2019ll bleach every piece of leather you own.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cStiles, it <em>seriously </em>doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Oh, he actually is getting angry now, Stiles can see it in the tightness in his jaw and the twitches in his hands. If Derek was in his own body, there would be claws by now and possibly some wall slamming. But Derek isn\u2019t in his own body, is he? Derek can be pushed.<br><br>\nStiles takes a deep breath and goes full on five-year-old. \u201cTell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, I can do this all night, man, tell me, tell me, tell m-\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cStiles!\u201d It must sting like hell when Derek slams his palm against the wall, fragile as Stiles knows that palm to be. Yup, definitely winning this one.<br><br>\n\u201cCome on, I can be annoying way longer than you can be stoic, tell me, tell me, tell me, what is it, what is it wh-\u201d<br><br>\nDerek turns on him, snarling. \u201cYou! It\u2019s you!\u201d His eyes are blazing, not supernaturally lit but still intense enough that Stiles shrinks back in his chair. \u201cJesus fucking- \u201d His hands run over his hair in a frustrated swipe, he\u2019d probably be tearing at it if there was enough to get a grip on. \u201cThat\u2019s what this body smells like. The smell. Is you.\u201d<br><br>\nStiles blinks, dumbstruck. No way. \u201cNo <em>way</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek stares at him, intensity fading to that familiar sour look before he snorts and turns away, back to the pile of books on the nightstand. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere because your body\u2019s been everywhere. Now drop it.\u201d<br><br>\nYeah, no. No in ten languages. Stiles has to check this shit out.<br><br>\nHe\u2019s on his feet and behind Derek in a few short steps, leaning in to take a deep breath at the back of his neck, where Stiles knows the sweat always gathers. This close, the scent comes in like a gale, whipping all through him. <em>Greenspice</em>.<br><br>\nHoly god, it <em>is </em>him.<br><br>\n\u201cOh my <em>god</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek hand-to-god <em>flails</em>, trying to turn around and step back in the same movement, which mostly ends up with him sideswiping Stiles and hip checking the nightstand.<br><br>\nSo it\u2019s at least half Stiles\u2019 body\u2019s fault that he spends so much time trying not to hit the floor. Good to know.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d Derek backs into the wall, eyes wide, hand flying up to the back of his neck.<br><br>\nStiles follows through a haze of scent, wanting his nose back in there right damn now. He crowds Derek\u2019s newly smaller body against the wall, stuffing his face into the curve of neck and shoulder and taking another deep sniff. \u201cHumuhgod.\u201d It\u2019s even better the second time, warming him from the inside out.<br><br>\nTwo hands push all over Stiles\u2019 face, shoving him back. Not all that far though, Stiles has freakish wolf-strength and at least one extra inch on his side, now.<br><br>\nPanting hard through grit teeth, Derek glares at him. \u201cGet ahold of yourself!\u201d<br><br>\nA beat of silence, and then they\u2019re both looking down to where Stiles has his hands on Derek\u2019s arms, fingers tight.<br><br>\nStiles flicks his eyes up again and barely has time to smirk before Derek rolls essentially his entire face. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, no, it\u2019s fine, I just-\u201d Stiles shifts to the other side, nosing into the fuzzy hair behind Derek\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got it under control, just let me- \u201c Derek\u2019s pulse picks up, breath catching in his throat, his hands still pushing at Stiles to very little effect. If anything, the way Derek\u2019s body is reacting just makes the scent even better, makes it less like a noses-only party and more like a freaking all-senses-invited aura or something. Stiles groans and presses in, mouth open to breathe in the full experience.<br><br>\n\u201cStiles! Stop!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMmhm.\u201d In a minute.<br><br>\nAnd then Derek knees him in the balls.<br><br>\nIt\u2019s a pretty iffy kneeing, as far as they go. With the way they\u2019re standing, he\u2019s barely able to make contact. But it\u2019s enough of a shock to send Stiles stumbling back with an alarmed grunt. \u201cUh, <em>ow</em>?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek falls back against the wall, catching his breath. \u201cYou have to calm down.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWho\u2019s not calm, I\u2019m calm! You know what\u2019s not calm? Kneeing someone in the junk!\u201d Stiles gestures towards the abused goods emphatically. Which in retrospect is a bad idea because, sudden realization, he is hard enough to put up drywall with his dick. Or something.<br><br>\nDerek doesn\u2019t notice though, he\u2019s too busy giving Stiles shit. \u201cYou weren\u2019t listening!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, well-\u201d He totally wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s not sure he could have without the knee distraction, which should be a sobering thought but mostly just leaves him angry and tangled up in instincts and guilt. \u201c-well. You know what? It\u2019s my body, so I can sniff it if I want to!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cCalm. Down.\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes squeeze shut as he breathes each word out tight through his teeth. Really, it looks like he\u2019s not even talking to Stiles at all.<br><br>\nThe thought makes Stiles pause and cock his head to the side, sniffing at the air. The scent has morphed now, turned all hot baked wood. And Stiles remembers it. Not the same scent, no, but the same sort of redshift change. Just like when Isaac lost it in that whole pack-pile incident and had started humping Stiles\u2019 Alpha-shin.<br><br>\nDerek is <em>into it.</em><br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re totally horny.\u201d Okay, that wasn\u2019t the subtle yet classy insinuation Stiles had intended. Sue him, he\u2019s busy being stunned.<br><br>\nDerek jerks, eyes flying open. \u201cNo, I- \u201c He stops himself, knowing Stiles can hear the lie.<br><br>\n\u201cLiar.\u201d Okay, so they both knew it, that doesn\u2019t mean Stiles can\u2019t get another point on the scoreboard.<br><br>\nDerek grunts, turning his head away. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf stuck in a teenager\u2019s body. And you were <em>sniffing </em><em>me</em>. It\u2019s only- \u201d It seems like he\u2019s struggling with the words, attention anywhere but on Stiles. His heart rate and breathing are doing very weird things, though.<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re still lying, sort of.\u201d Stiles muddles through the mess of instincts and sense-memories in his head. \u201cLike... half-lying. Which means. Something being left out, maybe?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek\u2019s eyes flick over to him, then down and away again with another twitch<br><br>\nHoly shit, Derek just checked him out. Or checked himself out. Whatever, who cares, somebody definitely just got checked out. \u201cOh wow.\u201d<br><br>\nHe doesn\u2019t know what that means, what exactly Derek is leaving out. But if it\u2019s not just automatic reactions, if it\u2019s something else too, then wow.<br><br>\nStiles takes a step forward, sees Derek tense up again and knows it\u2019s not a refusal. <em>Definitely </em>knows it when Derek\u2019s eyes lock on to his mouth.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Stiles</em><em>.</em>\u201d<br><br>\nIt\u2019s part warning and part plea, and even if it was said in Stiles\u2019 voice, the thought of Derek pleading for anything makes Stiles\u2019 lungs want to work double-time. \u201cWe can... \u201c He moves closer, licks his lips and sees Derek\u2019s eyes go heavy and dark at the sight. Oh yeah. \u201cWe can do this. Can we do this? I mean, I think we can do this. It\u2019s basically masturbation, right?\u201d<br><br>\nYeah, right.<br><br>\nDerek shudders and the woodspice scent comes up rich, thick in Stiles\u2019 nose, overpowering. It makes him want to own and he growls out around the need, crowding Derek into the wall again, not waiting for a reply.<br><br>\nHe has his nose pressed tight against the bend of Derek\u2019s jaw when Derek must decide that the answer is yes, because suddenly they\u2019re kissing. Oh, wow, Derek\u2019s mouth is warm. It\u2019s warm and wet and tasty and <em>weird as fuck</em> because it\u2019s Stiles\u2019 mouth. He\u2019s kissing his own mouth and licking at his own tongue, pressing his own body against the wall while his own hands go tight around his shoulders, and it is weird as fuck, but the weird barely rates beside the knowledge that this is <em>Derek</em>.<br><br>\nThey break apart, panting for breath. \u201cOh god.\u201d Stiles leans his head against Derek\u2019s neck, hands clenching in the worn grey hoodie he seems partial to. \u201cHow do more people not want to make out with me? My mouth is amazing!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Speaking of amazing, even coming out of Stiles\u2019 mouth Derek\u2019s sex-voice is practically debilitating. All rough and growly and Stiles is kissing him again, chasing it over his tongue.<br><br>\nThey kiss for ages, bodies shifting against each other while Stiles drowns in the taste and the sound, the feel of Derek rolling into him. It only stops when Derek\u2019s groans change, going higher and tighter. Stiles pulls back and... shit.<br><br>\nHe\u2019s holding Derek there. Both hands wrapped around thin wrists, he has them locked to the wall by Derek\u2019s head, holding fast even as Stiles feels the muscles under his palms flexing and pulling. \u201cOh, shit!\u201d He yanks his hands back like they\u2019ve been burnt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t-\u201d He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been doing that, so lost in wanting to kiss of fuck or eat Derek right through the wall, he hadn\u2019t had a fucking clue.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d It doesn\u2019t come out like an acceptance of Stiles\u2019 apology. It comes out <em>raw</em>. Derek\u2019s hands clench where he still holds them against the wall and his eyes slide shut. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br><br>\nHoly crap, he likes it.<br><br>\nOne part of Stiles (one stupid part that will not succeed in its quest to keep him unsexed) wants to psychoanalyze that, make sense of it with everything he knows about Derek, but the rest of him wants that part to fuck off so he can do exactly what Derek says.<br><br>\nNot a hard choice.<br><br>\nHe\u2019s back up in Derek\u2019s space in a heartbeat, hands pinning his wrists against the wall, mouth seeking that taste-scent again. Derek strains against his grip, but now Stiles can tell the difference. It\u2019s not Derek trying to get away, it\u2019s Derek testing the power in Stiles\u2019 hold, feeling how strong it is from the other side for once, and liking it.<br><br>\nBut Stiles can\u2019t keep it up, not with Derek grunting into his mouth like that and rocking his hips up. It makes Stiles\u2019 hands itch for more and he barely has any say in how they drag down Derek\u2019s arms and curve low around his back. He knows what they want, and it\u2019s like nothing to wrap them around Derek\u2019s waist and lift. No effort at all the hold like that while Derek groans into his mouth and wraps long legs around Stiles\u2019 hips, heels digging in hard to the backs of tense thighs.<br><br>\n\u201cOh my <em>god</em>.\u201d Best creepy self-making-out <em>ever</em>.<br><br>\nOr, no, because then Derek takes it another step into better, tearing his mouth away so Stiles can drag teeth down a long, sweat-damp neck. \u201cThe bed- hah- Stiles, the<em> </em><em>bed</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nWhat bed, Stiles doesn\u2019t own a bed. All he has is this wonderful wall and two handfuls of an ass that never felt this good when it was his. He squeezes through thin material, plaid pajama bottoms because werewolves only care about style when they\u2019re in their own bodies, and Derek makes the loudest noise yet, a sharp \u2018<em>ah</em>\u2019, before burying his hands in Stiles\u2019 hair and yanking. \u201cThe bed!\u201d<br><br>\nOhh, the <em>bed</em>. Also, note to self: grow the hair out even if it makes you look like a muppet, because sexy hair yanking feels fantastic.<br><br>\n\u201cBed, bed, yes, great plan, smart- oh god- smart thinking.\u201d He takes a deep breath in anticipation of the effort, but once again, it\u2019s like nothing to move away from the wall with Derek held up around him, the few steps between the wall and the bed easy and steady.<br><br>\nIt must not feel the same from the other side because Derek\u2019s arms go tight around his neck, holding on hard enough that Stiles has to tamp down the urge to rub his face all over him and tell him everything\u2019s okay. Because <em>really</em>. Seriously, what is a werewolf, a miserable little pile of instincts.<br><br>\nThey land soft when they make it to the side of the bed, Stiles still marvelling at how much more control he has over his muscles now, how they take the weight of two bodies leaning over with little strain. He lifts Derek again, pushing him farther onto the mattress until Stiles can crawl up after him, kneeling in between his spread legs.<br><br>\nA wave of vertigo sweeps through him as he stares down at Derek. At <em>himself</em>. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, totally inexperienced, half dazed with lust and scent, and he\u2019s doing it with <em>himself</em>. In that second it\u2019s all too much. It overwhelms him, makes his teeth itch and his hands ache, makes his bones want to shift and- god- \u201c<em>Derek</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Derek is right there, up on one arm and into Stiles\u2019 space with his palm rasping against Stiles\u2019 jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, just concentrate on me, just- here.\u201d He sits up and curls his fingers around the bottom of Stiles\u2019 shirt, sweeping it up and over his head in one movement. \u201cHere.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek\u2019s hands slide up his chest and along his shoulders, fingers spread wide over the dip and curve of trembling muscle. It feels so good, firm against firm. It pulls Stiles back down from the edge and he whimpers, leaning into Derek until they\u2019re flat on the bed again, nuzzling into the hand that finds its way up his neck.<br><br>\n\u201cYou good?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMmhm.\u201d Stiles lets his eyes fall shut, dipping his nose into Derek\u2019s palm and following the scent down to his wrist, powerful where the skin is so smooth and thin.<br><br>\n\u201cGood.\u201d<br><br>\nDeep down in the spice of skin and heartbeat, Stiles barely even senses the movement of Derek\u2019s legs as they wrap over his hips. So it\u2019s a shock when they go tight, lifting Derek hard against him, rolling them together through layers of cloth. Stiles gasps, hips bucking down hard against Derek. \u201c<em>Ahh</em><em>!</em>\u201d<br><br>\nDerek grunts in pleasure, head falling back against the blanket as the flush on his skin rises higher and hotter. Warm thighs work around Stiles\u2019 body, drawing him in and moving in ways he\u2019s pretty sure he never would have thought of. Stiles eases into the rhythm, finding the steadiest places to put his knees and the best angle to tilt his hips, hard to do when all he wants is to lay over Derek and let it take him.<br><br>\nStiles does something right though, because suddenly they\u2019re there, they\u2019re locked and tight and grinding against each other and Stiles can feel it. He can feel the hard length of Derek\u2019s cock perfectly, dragging against his own over and over again. \u201cOh, holy, Derek, <em>wow</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek just nods against the bed, eyes still shut and mouth open around groaning little whimpers. Stiles tucks his face into Derek\u2019s throat, mouth and nose working at it like he could somehow get right into the skin. He needs everything,<em>everything</em>. The sweat gathering in the dips and valleys under Derek\u2019s shirt is close enough to smell, but that\u2019s not enough.<br><br>\nDerek sucks in a surprised breath when Stiles pulls them both upright and yanks that ratty grey hoodie off him, rough enough that a few seams tear with a stuttering rip. Stiles growls in frustration, because of course there\u2019s another shirt underneath, all tucked up under Derek\u2019s armpits now. It follows the first just as fast, leaving Derek bare and pink-flushed from the waist up, chest heaving.<br><br>\nFor most of his life, Stiles has never been exactly happy about this view. How he\u2019s paler and thinner than a lot of the other guys. Freckled, with that full body blush that just screams his embarrassment to the world. But now... <em> fuck</em>.<br><br>\nA second later they\u2019re flat on the bed again, Stiles sighing in satisfaction as bare skin slides against bare skin. It\u2019s so <em>hot </em>pressed together like this, and the sweat collects along Derek\u2019s collarbone even as Stiles licks it away. He holds Derek down, spreads him out with his arms wide and loses himself in taste while they move together. Derek groans with each swipe of Stiles\u2019 tongue, shudders every time Stiles rubs a stubbled cheek against him, cries out when teeth scrape over his shoulder or against the sensitive skin around his nipples.<br><br>\nThey never stop moving, tangled up and locked together until Derek is arcing up from the bed, spine a hard curve. His voice is strangled and whining when he can finally force it out. \u201cJesus, <em>Stiles</em>! I- fuck, I can\u2019t- hold on- fucking hair trigger- <em>harder</em>!\u201d<br><br>\nStiles is whimpering back, loses his grip on Derek\u2019s arms as they fly up to wrap around the wide span of his shoulders. He presses down heavily against Derek\u2019s chest, face tucked into his neck, mouth open and gasping against his throat. \u201cTha- <em>ah</em>! That body\u2019s never been- with someone else- <em>god</em>! Hell d\u2019you expect?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek seems to contract at that, thighs suddenly like vises around Stiles\u2019 hips, arms clawing tight. He surges up against Stiles with a strangled noise,a mixed sob and growl, clinging while he, fuck, while he <em>comes </em>in Stiles\u2019 arms, in his bed, in his fucking<em> </em><em>body</em>.<br><br>\n\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re, oh my <em>god</em>.\u201d The scent of it hits, a hundred times stronger, a thousand time sharper, driving into Stiles\u2019 skull and he has to- he doesn\u2019t know- he needs- \u201cDerek!\u201d<br><br>\nHis body is moving almost without him, turning Derek onto his stomach and tearing at his own pants, pulling and shoving until they\u2019re down around his thighs and his cock is free.<br><br>\nFingers twisting hard in the blanket, Derek turns his head back, voice hoarse. \u201cDon\u2019t-!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Stiles shakes his head even as he\u2019s laying himself down over Derek\u2019s back. He won\u2019t, he still has enough control left to keep himself from that, from shoving Derek\u2019s pants down and losing everything inside him just like this body wants. But even the thought of it, the image, has him shaking as he finds the dip between Derek\u2019s cheeks and shoves his cock along it with a harsh whimper.<br><br>\nThe friction is strange, the thin cloth of Derek\u2019s pants moving with Stiles and bunching up around his cock, but he still can\u2019t keep himself from rutting against Derek\u2019s ass, hips jerking hard as he mouths blindly at the trembling muscles in Derek\u2019s shoulders. His teeth ache to bite and scrape along the nape of Derek\u2019s neck and Stiles grinds them hard, snarling through the urges.<br><br>\nDerek goes rigid underneath him and, for a second, some small part of Stiles shrinks back, sure it\u2019s fear that Derek\u2019s showing. But it doesn\u2019t smell like fear. It smells like, it\u2019s not actually possible but it almost smells like Derek is coming <em>again</em>, that hot forest scent driving Stiles to grind even harder against him, riding him into the mattress.<br><br>\nAnd it has to hurt how Derek\u2019s cock, barely spent, is trapped between his body and the growing wet spot on the bed. Stiles has always been ridiculously sensitive after he comes. But Derek only flings his arm back until he can grab hold of Stiles\u2019 thigh and urge him on, blunt nails digging into the clenching muscle.<br><br>\nIt\u2019s possibly the spark of pain that does it, who knows, but suddenly the curling need in Stiles\u2019 belly is <em>urgent</em>, dragging him up. He fits one hand around the back of Derek\u2019s neck and sets the other between his shoulders, fingers spread wide, pinning Derek flat against the bed. The pressure lifts Derek\u2019s ass and Stiles throws his head back, crying out as he fucks against the hot curve of it. This is the moment he might break, these are the seconds where the wolf clawing in his chest might tear through and take Derek, fuck him, <em>mate </em>him. Stiles is shaking with it, voice and body both <em>howling</em>.<br><br>\nBut it can\u2019t happen, he\u2019s already coming, everything from his ass down to his toes flexing hard and working for as much sliding contact as possible. He soaks the band of Derek\u2019s pants and comes all over his back in slick lines, growling in satisfaction at the sight. His hands barely keep their hold against Derek\u2019s skin as Stiles fucks himself through it, past it, until he\u2019s shaking, whimpering, eyes squeezed shut over the rough feel of cloth against his cock. God, he can\u2019t stop, why can\u2019t he <em>stop</em>?<br><br>\nIt\u2019s Derek that finally gets Stiles\u2019 attention, loose and pliant underneath him, repeating his name breathlessly until Stiles finally stills, calmed by the sound of it. Shuddering, he opens his eyes.<br><br>\nOh, god. Derek is <em>covered </em>in him.<br><br>\nThick lines of come pool and slide down Derek\u2019s back, marking him, pulling Stiles to crouch down against him, weak and shivering. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do until he does it, he barely knows his own name, but when he rubs his rough cheek into the wet patterns of his own come, spreading it up Derek\u2019s back and mixing it into the smell of their skin, it only feels right.<br><br>\nHe\u2019s panting heavily, slumped with his sticky face mashed against Derek\u2019s shoulder when Derek finally shrugs him off and turns over. He looks about as messed up as Stiles feels, open and vulnerable in ways Stiles is too out of it to think about right now. Half on his side, Stiles only has the energy to watch as Derek leans closer and, with a carefulness that makes Stiles feel more things he doesn\u2019t want to think about, licks at his cheek.<br><br>\nStiles whines but Derek just pushes him onto his back and finishes the job, tongue scraping against stubble. When he\u2019s done, he licks his way to Stiles\u2019 mouth and in, sharing the mixed flavour of them before falling back onto the bed with a breathy grunt.<br><br>\nStiles blinks at the ceiling, every part of him weak, stunned. \u201cSo...\u201d<br><br>\nSlim fingers brush against his thigh, distracting him with the soft rub of knuckles. Eventually, after Derek turns and curls up with the skin of his back tacky against Stiles\u2019 arm, Stiles remembers that he\u2019d been saying something.<br><br>\n\u201cSo...\u201d<br><br>\nWow, the entire universe smells like him and Derek now. That\u2019s nice. That can stay. Oh right, saying something.<br><br>\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m kind of upset that Scott never told me the finer details of awesome werewolf sex.\u201d<br><br>\nDerek \u2018<em>hmph</em>\u2019s in reply. It\u2019s either a laugh of the fondest \u2018you idiot\u2019 Stiles has ever heard. That can stay, too.<br><br>\nStiles speaks up again a few minutes later, because even the most intense of experiences aren\u2019t enough to keep him down for long. \u201cHey, how weird would it be if I devirginized my own ass?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek goes stiff beside him and Stiles can practically smell the denial. \u201cNo.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t <em>planning</em>, I was just saying.\u201d Stiles flushes, a much less obvious effect in Derek\u2019s skin, and tries not to remember how close he got to doing exactly that.<br><br>\nDerek turns again, shifting against the wrinkled blanket until he\u2019s facing Stiles, watching him intently. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in the right body when that happens.\u201d<br><br><em>When </em>that happens. Stiles swallows over the hard thump his heart takes. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna fuck me?\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean for it to come out all sexy, but he can\u2019t help it if his throat has gone dry and his voice is wrecked to shit and extra Derek-y. He can already feel this body reacting to the dirty pictures in his head and he takes a moment to reflect on how unfair it is if the werewolf recovery bonus extends to dicks as well. He has time to think about it since Derek is just staring at him, eyes tracking over Stiles\u2019 face like he\u2019s trying to see under it to the actual Stiles inside.<br><br>\n\u201cYes.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like a threat or a promise when Derek finally answers, it\u2019s more like a certainty. A truth.<br><br>\n\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles blinks and tries to keep from staring at Derek\u2019s mouth. The whole sex haze is finally clearing and being attracted to his own face is starting to get weird again. \u201cOkay.\u201d He was a sure thing anyway, so he supposes it\u2019s good to know that Derek is on the same page.<br><br>\nObviously done with the conversation and the act of conversing in general, Derek turns away and curls up against Stiles\u2019 side again. It\u2019s sort of surprising that he doesn\u2019t want a shower, or at least a towel or something, but if smelling like sticky sex and werewolf from head to toe doesn\u2019t bother him, Stiles isn\u2019t going to complain.<br><br>\nShit, he\u2019d bite his tongue off first. And with this mouth that is not an empty threat.<br><br>\nHis mind circles while they lay there, buzzing around school and pack and asshole wizards who he\u2019s feeling just a little magnanimous toward right now but who still need their dead teeth kicked in, before coming back around to werewolves and the sexing thereof.<br><br>\n\u201cHey, Derek?\u201d<br><br>\nThere\u2019s no answer, but he\u2019ll take the slight change in Derek\u2019s breathing as a \u2018yes, Stiles, I am paying attention, your sexual prowess has simply robbed me of my ability to speak\u2019. Or possibly just a \u2018yes, Stiles\u2019.<br><br>\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t everybody all over me if I smell this good? All the pack, I mean\u201d Because Peter sort of had been, but that bit of knowledge is packed away in a box labeled \u2018Nope\u2019 and thrown into the very dustiest corner of Stiles\u2019 mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019ve had a lot of practice controlling their shit like you have.\u201d<br><br>\nOn the tail end of a sigh that was definitely edging toward a snore, Derek answers. \u201c's different for everyone, you don't smell like that to them.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh. So why do I smell that way to you?\u201d<br><br>\nDerek hesitates before answering, body sleep-still but heartbeat giving him away. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d<br><br>\nStiles snorts, dragging his arm up from where it's gone numb under Derek's back and repurposing it as a pillow. With his free hand, he tugs on his pants until they look somewhere in the vicinity of proper. \u201cIt's gonna suck when we're back in our own bodies and I won\u2019t be able to sniff out when you're doing that deflecting thing any more.\u201d No reaction, naturally. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t sleep, I have to not be here when Dad gets home.\u201d<br><br>\nWell past half-asleep now (Derek is a born napper, who knew), Derek replies with a murmur. \u201c\u2018S\u2019fine, you\u2019ll hear him.\u201d With a last bit of effort, he drags himself up a few inches, taking up whatever room is left on Stiles\u2019 arm-pillow. \u201cY\u2019wake up when you feel some\u2019n in your territory...\u201d<br><br>\nOh, well that\u2019s alright then. He is feeling pretty wiped now after all that sexual prowessing, no matter what his dick thinks. Derek\u2019s dick. Their dick? Bah. Maybe the asshole wizard research can be put on hold for the night. Who knows, a fresh brain might be helpful in trying to figure out- hey.<br><br>\n\u201cWait, what d\u2019you mean my territory. Derek? If anything, it\u2019s his-\u201d<br><br>\nDerek makes a happy rumbling noise beside him, totally gone.<br><br>\n\u201cDerek?\u201d<br><br>\nNada.<br><br>\nFine. Whatever. It\u2019s not like he can\u2019t badger answers out of displaced werewolves tomorrow just as well as he did today.<br><br>\nFiguring he may as well make the best of it, Stiles rolls onto his side and eases up against Derek\u2019s back. With an arm around Derek\u2019s waist and the other still doing pillow duty, he resigns himself to being the big bone to Derek\u2019s little bone for the next hour at least.<br><br>\nHa, \u2018bone\u2019.<br><br>\nFreaking wizards.</p>"
