  "text": "<p><br>There\u2019s a child underneath Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize this until he sits down and tiny hands wrap themselves around his ankles, and Fire Lord Zuko definitely does not shriek and backpedal away at the unexpected touch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He definitely <em> does </em> do that, but Gou, the single guard he\u2019s agreed to let shadow him, is kind enough not to mention it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko likes Gou, he decides. He might promote him, even if his reflexes are slow to the point that if this was an assassination, Zuko would have to save himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko does not have to save himself, because when he kneels down and peers underneath his desk, a small child, practically a baby\u2014 a <em> mobile </em> baby, peers right back at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The baby makes grabby hands at him and replies but not in human words that Zuko can understand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Spirits</em>. A baby? Zuko has no idea what to do with a baby. Is he stuck with it? Is this how fatherhood approaches him at his virginal age of seventeen?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It does not occur to Fire Lord Zuko, not even a little bit that he can, in fact, foist the infant off onto somebody else. Literally anybody else. He\u2019s the Fire Lord, he could hand the child over to Gou and the man would be legally obligated to change his job title to babysitter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko does not do this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, Zuko holds out his hands and the kid makes a trusting beeline for him, crashing into his robes with the full force of a toddler with minimal gross motor control. Zuko rocks back on his heels, lifts the child by the armpits, and looks them in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says, not entirely unlike the way he greets the resident pygmy-pumas, \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon my interruption, Your Majesty,\u201d Gou interjects, \u201cBut she probably belongs to one of the staff. It\u2019s not, uh, my place to say, but one of your housekeepers, Missus Sayaka, mentioned that she was unable to get her usual babysitter this morning over breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko frowns a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not to say that the palace isn\u2019t a place for children, but it\u2019s not really a good place for unsupervised children. A hypocritical thing to think, really, considering just how much of his childhood Zuko himself spent unsupervised, but he was probably at least a little older than this. Mom would have had a heart attack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child kicks her legs and laughs brightly at being picked up. Zuko\u2019s stomach twists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Do you have any children, Gou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Your Majesty. Shall I go fetch her mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a problem. I wouldn\u2019t want her to miss out on work, but I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s worried. If you could send for someone to let her know that I\u2019ve got the kid\u2014what\u2019s her name? Do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe that her name is Rin, Fire Lord Zuko.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease let Missus Sayaka know that I\u2019ve found Rin and that she\u2019s with me.\u201d Zuko stands up and settles the baby against his chest so she can peer over his shoulder. \u201cRin, is it? I\u2019m Zuko.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know much about kids but it\u2019s good to talk to them, right? Can babies talk when they\u2019re this old? At all?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Uko!\u201d She squeals happily, \u201c\u2018Uko, up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re already up,\u201d Zuko tells her. \u201cAnd I have a meeting. Right? That\u2019s a thing I have today?\u201d It\u2019s a fairly safe bet that Zuko <em> always </em>has a meeting of some kind and if he doesn\u2019t, something will pop up. Or it\u2019s reading, or signing something, or screaming at a general or two.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You know, a Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uncle\u2019s always telling him that he needs to take a break.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, he can\u2019t. He\u2019s only been Fire Lord for six months. That\u2019s <em> nothing </em> , that\u2019s a drop in the bucket, and Zuko can\u2019t afford to take a break. The world is delicate, and fragile, and the Fire Nation is not <em> safe.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s already lost his country once; he won\u2019t do it again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But sometimes, late at night when he\u2019s not sleeping, because sleep comes in catnaps these days, Zuko can\u2019t imagine doing this for the rest of his life. He\u2019s lonely all the time. He has no family here and his friends are scattered. It\u2019s supposed to get easier, right? When does it get easier?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t ever tell Uncle Iroh, so far away in Ba Sing Se, and so <em> happy</em>, that sometimes he just wants all of it to stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>...Gou\u2019s talking. Zuko should probably listen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014with the minister of Agriculture. Do you need anything beforehand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s sure that he probably does but spirits know that he can\u2019t think of anything. So he adjusts Rin in his arms because she\u2019s squirming, fits her so she\u2019s scooped comfortably into the crook of his arm. One chubby hand twists in the collar of his robes, the other pats his cheek. The baby coos at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gou looks like he might say something, but Zuko finds himself smiling back at her like there was no other option. How could he not?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gou closes his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Uko <em> \u2018all</em>,\u201d Rin tells him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that tall,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou\u2019re just tiny. Like a little tiger-shrimp. Are kids supposed to be this tiny? How long do they stay this tiny?\u201d Zuko\u2019s not that big but he <em> feels </em> big, and has the sudden, misplaced fear that he\u2019s definitely going to drop her or break her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...are you certain that you\u2019d rather not send for Sayaka?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease just go tell her before she has a breakdown over missing her kid,\u201d Zuko snaps. His voice sharpens in a way he doesn\u2019t mean, and Rin buries her face in his neck. He sighs in apology. \u201cPlease. I know that she has to be worried. The longer you wait, the more she\u2019ll worry. I\u2019m pretty sure that this is something I can handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d Gou bows and exits the room faster than Zuko\u2019s ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Zuko had slept for more than two hours over the past two days, he would have remembered several things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[1] He would have remembered that most of the house staff is terrified of him. A few who spend more time around him, like Gou and Chef Bon and his stylist Hanako (why does he even have a stylist? He can brush his own damned hair and dress himself, even if he does still struggle with getting the crown to sit straight on his head.) are less afraid, but for the most part, he\u2019s avoided at all costs. Zuko tries to not think about how that adds to the unmoored feeling of being lost at sea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[2] He would have remembered that he <em> did </em> actually need a particular scroll for this meeting, and he does not currently have it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[3] He would have remembered that hearing the words \u2018the Fire Lord has your baby\u2019 sound way scarier when most everyone\u2019s Fire Lord experience consists of his father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, because Fire Lord Zuko has only slept about two hours in the past two days, he does not remember any of those things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko tries to do the best job he can with what he\u2019s given.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little thankless and his entire life, personal or otherwise, has suffered for it, but it\u2019s important and Zuko knows this. He really does know this, but Minister Jing is <em> so boring </em> that Zuko can barely keep his eyes open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing keeping people from talking is the fact that they\u2019re afraid of him, Zuko thinks with no small amount of resentment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one dares mention the toddler supported carefully in Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s lap, nor the way that he alternates his questions, even when he accidentally asks Rin her opinions on prospective rice yields and Minister Jing whether he can say the word \u2018blue\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rin does not have an opinion on the rice yields or the color blue but she does have a very strong opinion on the length of Zuko\u2019s meeting. He agrees with her, silently, and tries to balance entertaining her with his productivity for as long as she\u2019ll have it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A baby can only tolerate it for so long, it seems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rin fusses, settles for a moment, and then opens her mouth, and the loudest wail that Zuko\u2019s ever heard comes out. Big, fat tears roll down her cheeks and she bangs her tiny fists on his chest and kicks her feet. Zuko would not mind the opportunity to kick his feet a little and scream about it with her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he\u2019s the Fire Lord so Zuko does not do this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What he <em> does </em> do, however, is get to his feet and bounce Rin a little in his arms to try and calm her because spirits, <em> that noise is unholy</em>, and bow a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a rain check,\u201d he says like it\u2019s an option when he means that it\u2019s a requirement, firmly and with little room for argument. \u201cYou were mostly done, weren't you?\u201d Minister Jing was not mostly done if the look on his face is any indication, but Zuko finds, for once, that he can\u2019t make himself care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shuffles out of the room and heads for his office. Zuko\u2019s head throbs as much from Rin\u2019s crying as from sleep deprivation, and all he wants to do is lay down. He can\u2019t do that, exactly, but he can at least take a moment and let Rin run around his office. Inactivity isn\u2019t good for little kids, right? There\u2019s not anything she can really get into in there, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s thinking so hard that he almost runs headlong into Fuyumi, the head of house staff. In fact, be barely avoids hitting Fuyumi and in doing so nearly careens into a wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Majesty! Are you alright?\u201d She asks with more concern than he deserves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko groans a little. Whacking a wall has done nothing for the mood of the toddler he\u2019s put himself in charge of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you. Just...need a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi, blessedly, is one of the few people in the palace who makes no indication of having been afraid of anything or anyone, ever. She\u2019s a firm and no-nonsense woman in her forties, and generally makes it her personal responsibility for bringing Zuko meals and generally making sure that he\u2019s still alive at the beginning and end of each day even though he\u2019s sure that she has better things that she could be doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you make kids stop crying?\u201d He asks her tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi clucks at him a little and takes Rin from him, ignoring her wailing to check her bottom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s dry, but when was the last time you fed her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c....uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s answer enough, and Fuyumi sighs and hands her back to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go fetch a meal for her,\u201d she says. \u201cTry and keep her distracted until then, Your Majesty.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi must think that Zuko is, like, the most useless Fire Lord in existence. She\u2019s not wrong either, especially if Zuko can\u2019t even remember that babies need to <em> eat </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rin has no interest in the papers that litter Zuko\u2019s desk but she does like the little model of a turtleduck that Toph made him, bent out of smelted metal that Zuko likes to use as a paperweight. So instead of getting any actual work done, Zuko ends up on the floor while the toddler alternates between gnawing on his things and scuttling around underneath his couch. She\u2019s still cranky but seems happier to at least have some freedom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, so is Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not too long before there\u2019s a knock on the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi\u2019s back with a tray in her hands, and Zuko can\u2019t interpret the look on her face when she sees him on his belly on the floor with a toddler sitting on the flat of his shoulders and mercilessly tugging his hair out of order. It\u2019s too soft of a look to be judgement. If Zuko didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think it was a look of affection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, Your Majesty. Children are messy.\u201d She hands him a napkin and ties another loosely around Rin\u2019s neck for a bib. \u201cWould you like anything from the kitchens?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko waves her off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s very rarely hungry, lately. He can eat later when he has more time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Zuko doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s been telling himself that for months now, and that Chef Bon has been sending meals up to him whether he asked for them or not. He also doesn\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve shifted from hot food to things that can be eaten cold, because it usually takes at least an hour for him to remember that there\u2019s food in front of him.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi bows and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tray is all easy food cut up into small pieces that can be eaten by hand. There\u2019s a little pile of cubed komodo-chicken, some sticky rice, and cut up straw-banana, and Rin immediately clambers off of him to sit on the floor next to the tray. She goes for the fruit first, popping a few pieces into her mouth with gusto, then looks at Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Uko,\u201d she says with her mouth full, holds out a slightly smushed piece of straw-banana. \u201c\u2018Uko <em> eat</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s done a lot of things in his life that he\u2019s not proud of but he\u2019s not an <em> asshole</em>. He could no more reject that offering than he could stop breathing. He doesn\u2019t really want it but that\u2019s overruled by his absolute refusal to hurt the feelings of a baby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, and eats the offered fruit, determinedly not thinking about where Rin\u2019s hands have been. Zuko\u2019s got the immune system of a tank and he\u2019s eaten way worse things than food that\u2019s touched an unwashed baby hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The worst thing is that she only eats about half of what Fuyumi brought because she keeps handing food to Zuko, who is a sucker and doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018no\u2019. Well, he knows it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just not used to using it as of late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you still hungry, Rin?\u201d Zuko asks. He doesn\u2019t really expect an answer and he doesn\u2019t get one. Well, he gets a pleased <em> \u2018Uko </em> for his trouble, but that doesn\u2019t tell him if the kid\u2019s still hungry. How much are kids supposed to eat? He eyes the empty plate with some scepticism and eventually pops his head out of his office to call for another plate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi shows up with it, again, looking like the pygmy puma that ate the canary-mouse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko eyes her offering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...this doesn\u2019t look like kid food,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think babies like spicy peanut noodles? Can babies even eat those?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s on a baby plate,\u201d Fuyumi tells him, grinning. It <em> is </em>on a baby plate. It\u2019s sectioned off and everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think babies eat this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, here.\u201d She hands him the plate and a pair of chopsticks, and then a little bamboo steamer basket. \u201cChef Bon sent these too. For babies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Zuko\u2019s consternation, inside the basket is an assortment of bao and, gratifyingly, some steamed sweet potato-choke with cinnamon butter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuyumi, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Fuyumi is already bowing deeply to him and out the door, and Zuko feels, somehow, that he\u2019s just been played.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It turns out that Zuko is right and that babies do not, in fact, like spicy peanut noodles. Babies will eat exactly one noodle and make a face and proceed to give the rest an impressive stink eye. Babies also eat only part of the bread of one pork bao and the butteriest parts of the sweet potato-chokes and leave the rest for Zuko, who isn\u2019t hungry but also hates the idea of wasting food.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t forgotten his time as a refugee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t forgotten any of it at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Zuko eats the spicy peanut noodles <em> and </em> the pork bao <em> and </em>the rest of the sweet potato-chokes. At first he\u2019s sure that he can\u2019t, because his appetite feels nonexistent and the idea of eating right now makes him feel vaguely nauseated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He manages, though, and when he\u2019s finished he feels...better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still feels tired and rundown but less hollow, only flinching a bit when little Rin throws herself into his lap, knees first into his shins. Looking at her now, Zuko would never have guessed that she\u2019d been screeching like an angry leopard seal not even an hour ago. She\u2019s certainly cheerful enough now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko looks at Rin and then around at his office. It\u2019s sparsely decorated and formal, with no indication of Zuko\u2019s personality. Or <em> anyone\u2019s </em> personality at all, in fact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A child can\u2019t possibly be happy in here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko drags the plush, woven blanket off of his sofa, tosses it over his shoulder, and offers Rin his hand. She curls her whole hand around two of his fingers and Zuko makes himself hunch over so that she doesn\u2019t have to stretch her arm too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a field trip. I think you could use some sun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Rin bounces the entire way to the gardens and nearly falls on her face more than once. Zuko offers to scoop her but it seems that she\u2019d rather go at her own babyish walk-run and Zuko figures that it\u2019s fine. If she can walk herself, she should. It\u2019s not that far and it\u2019s a pretty day, and the combination of food and sunshine do more to lift his mood than he could have thought possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he should just start taking all of his meetings outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting in the sun and keeping a careful eye on the toddler running amok through his mother\u2019s long-tended flowerbeds is a thousand times more pleasant than talking rice yields and international reparations, but even rice yields and reparations might be easier to handle if he could do them out here instead of inside, where even the large throne room makes him feel trapped and cornered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting on his blanket and half dazed with the warm feeling of the sun on his face, Zuko stifles a yawn so big that his eyes water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Uko!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He blinks and immediately has a cluster of plants shoved into his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rin hasn\u2019t touched the massive rose blossoms or the spears of bright gladiolus, or the veritable rainbow of daisies. Instead, she\u2019s dug up a good handful of flowering weeds from the edge of the pond, the roots still attached.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She shakes them at him and showers the blanket with dirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are very pretty, Rin,\u201d Zuko says, and takes them carefully from her when it becomes clear that she\u2019s offering them as a gift. The day is still young but it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s wearing herself out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Babies take naps, right? That\u2019s a thing?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a word that Rin knows, clear as anything, and Zuko\u2019s not sure whether he wants to laugh or sigh. In the end, he does both, one right after the other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNaptime?\u201d He offers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No night-night.\u201d Rin scowls at him, juts out her lower lip and <em> pouts</em>. Despite the determined attitude, she\u2019s squinting a little. Zuko has to cover his mouth to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even a little one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh well,\u201d Zuko says, light and breezy, \u201cGuess I have to do it all by myself, then. You\u2019re in charge, now. Night-night, Rin.\u201d With plenty of pomp, he flops over onto his side and lounges dramatically on top of his blanket, making a show of closing his eyes and pretending to snore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a good thirty seconds, there\u2019s silence. Zuko is pretty sure that Rin\u2019s still pouting at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a quiet, diabolical little cackle and then there\u2019s a child burrowing her way underneath Zuko\u2019s arm. He props himself up on his elbow and tries very hard to ignore the way his feelings all suddenly feel too big to fit inside his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels like it\u2019s been <em> forever </em> since anybody\u2019s dared to touch him in any way and Zuko, out of nowhere, suddenly misses his uncle with an intensity that physically hurts. They write often but it\u2019s not the same, and it\u2019s too easy for Zuko to omit what he doesn\u2019t want to say\u2014that he\u2019s lonely, and unhappy, and that he wishes that he\u2019d come back. Zuko <em> understands </em> but it doesn\u2019t make him feel better. He understands, and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t say it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNight-night, \u2018Uko,\u201d Rin orders and sleepily slap-pats at his cheek. \u201cNight-night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs Her Majesty commands,\u201d Zuko teases, and closes his eyes at first just for pretend, but the sun feels <em> so good </em> on his face and on his spirit that within minutes he\u2019s asleep himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Fire Lord found Rin in his office,\u201d Gou says, and Sayaka feels like she\u2019s having a panic attack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bad enough that she had no choice but to bring Rin to work in the first place. Worse still that her wily toddler wandered off the moment Sayaka wasn\u2019t actively watching her. And absolute worst of all: the Fire Lord had <em> found </em> her. In his <em> office.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka needs to sit down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gou continues as if he\u2019s talking about the weather instead of Sayaka\u2019s <em> only child</em>. Maybe it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t been in the palace for very long\u2014Fire Lord Zuko hired him after his coronation so maybe he just doesn\u2019t know. But Sayaka\u2019s been working in the palace for a year and a half and she\u2019s seen the kinds of things these royals do\u2014Princess Azula\u2019s last few days with a crown were some of the most terrifying in Sayaka\u2019s life and she\u2019s heard plenty of stories from some of the more senior staff about Ozai.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka hasn\u2019t even <em> seen </em>Fire Lord Zuko since his coronation; she doesn\u2019t have a reason to cross his path and even if she did, he always seems to be holed up in the throne room or his office with the door shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone says, when his hair gets pulled back and out of his face, how much the Fire Lord resembles his father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remembering that makes Sayaka\u2019s bones shake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas...was he angry?\u201d She manages to ask, finally. Gou still doesn\u2019t seem worried. <em> Why </em>isn\u2019t he worried? Sayaka likes Gou, so why doesn\u2019t he seem to understand why this is a big deal?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, he was fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fine? <em> Fine? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says that you can finish your shift and then pick her up when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka slides down the wall when Gou leaves to complete the rest of his duties, and buries her face in her hands. This feels like a nightmare. Is making her finish her shift some kind of awful kind game that the Fire Lord is playing? Is this her punishment, to run every terrible scenario through her head all day while her baby is\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spirits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What\u2019s he going to do to her? Rin\u2019s just a baby. He wouldn\u2019t <em> hurt </em> a baby, would he? Sayaka cuts off that line of thought. She can\u2019t think that or she\u2019s going to melt down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She somehow manages to make it through several, agonizing hours of work before she can\u2019t handle it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Sayaka\u2019s going to lose her job. Maybe the Fire Lord will decide that that\u2019s not good enough, and just banish her. The Princess had gotten rid of a good chunk of her own staff. Most of them had refused to come back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka feels cold all the way down to her feet when she finds the head of staff, Fuyumi, and demands to see her daughter. Fuyumi\u2019s worked in the palace for almost twenty years and acts like it, but she\u2019s kind and professional and more likely to understand Sayaka\u2019s fears. Fuyumi interacts more with Fire Lord Zuko than almost anyone else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll understand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuyumi <em> does </em> understand, and places a steady, comforting hand on Sayaka\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that His Majesty wouldn\u2019t hurt a child, right?\u201d she asks kindly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka does not know this and keeps her thoughts about it to herself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Zuko is not in his office where Fuyumi left him about an hour ago. He\u2019s not in the throne room, and he\u2019s not wandering the halls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Zuko is found in the royal gardens. Fuyumi announces herself but there\u2019s no response, and Sayaka nearly slams into her back when she stops dead in her tracks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Curled up on a blanket is the Fire Lord himself, looking younger and smaller with his hair loose and wearing casual robes. He\u2019s motionless in sleep, and tucked carefully into the crook of his arm is\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Rin,</em>\u201d Sayaka breathes and feels so relieved she wants to cry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The look on Fuyumi\u2019s face is warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, didn't I?\u201d She asks. \u201cThat boy would never hurt a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka wipes at her face and sniffles. At the noise, Rin stirs and sits up, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMama!\u201d She exclaims with a squeal and scrambles out of the Fire Lord\u2019s easy hold, making a beeline for her mother. Sayaka kneels and catches her. \u201cMama okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, darling. Just happy to see you. I was worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Zuko begins to stir the moment his arm slips and it\u2019s with a quiet groan that he sits up and rubs at his own eyes. Like a flipped switch, Sayaka\u2019s relief turns to fear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have a good rest, Your Majesty?\u201d Fuyumi asks him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment that the Fire Lord realizes that he got caught taking an afternoon nap in the sun is a visible one. He goes red and twists his hands awkwardly, like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them, and suddenly Sayaka can\u2019t see Ozai in him at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All she can see is a tired kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rin points at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Uko!\u201d She says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fire Lord Zuko</em>,\u201d Sayaka says hurriedly, \u201cBe polite, honey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe can call me what she likes,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been called way worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka sets Rin down on the ground and kneels, so low that her forehead touches grass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord Zuko, I\u2019m <em> so sorry,</em>\u201d she says. This is it. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to make up for the inconvenience she\u2019s caused you, please\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t bow to me like that. Okay? Sit up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Zuko rubs his temples like he\u2019s trying hard to fend off a headache. Rin, socially oblivious as very small children tend to be, dodges her mother\u2019s grab and trots right back up to him, patting his scarred cheek with a hand. Fire Lord Zuko allows it with grace, and his whole posture softens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka can\u2019t see, but Fuyumi is trying desperately to not smile behind her back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was\u2014it was no trouble,\u201d he finally manages. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014<em> she </em> was no trouble.\u201d Fire Lord Zuko is painfully awkward and looks uncomfortable, almost shy. A seventeen year old boy is still, apparently, a seventeen year old boy, crown on his head or not. Weirdly, it makes Sayaka feel better about it all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, watching the way her little daughter bounces happily around him, it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no way in a frozen volcano that Fire Lord Zuko would allow any harm to come to Rin, much less from his own hand. Fire Nation royalty, historically, have always been dangerous. It\u2019s part of what has made them so powerful, as a country.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But what Ozai had forgotten that Fire Lord Zuko clearly has not, is that that danger is for <em> others</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s said that the royal bloodline contains the blood of dragons. It\u2019s what gives them the right to rule and the strength to hold onto the throne and the determination to take down anything that stands in their way. Dragons protect their hoard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dragons are not <em> safe...</em>except to those they care for and it\u2019s clear that under Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s careful watch, Rin could not be safer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sayaka remembers, out of nowhere, that Fuyumi <em> knew </em> this. Twenty years working in the palace meant that she\u2019d seen plenty and not only that, had seen plenty of Fire Lord Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No wonder she\u2019d been so calm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sayaka drops her face into her hands and drags in a long, shaky breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She knows, deep down, that after this she won\u2019t ever be able to be afraid of him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you very much, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThank you for taking such good care of my baby. Thank you for looking after your people so well, Your Majesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The smile he gives her is still awkward and shy, but warm and very sweet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Fire Lord Zuko asks. Quietly, like he\u2019s unsure of the answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do, my lord.\u201d Sayaka bows to him once again, and he <em> matches it </em>with one of his own, lower than his station requires towards someone like her. Rin takes advantage of his lowered head to grab him around the neck in a hug that Sayaka knows from personal experience is tight and difficult to dislodge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGently, dearest,\u201d she says pointlessly. Fire Lord Zuko doesn\u2019t seem to mind; on the contrary, he wraps an arm around Rin and squeezes her gently, then lifts her to place her in Sayaka\u2019s arms. \u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko tells her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t nothing and everyone knows it, except for Fire Lord Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko can\u2019t sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can remember very distinctly the last time he truly slept well: immediately following Sozin\u2019s Comet, and he\u2019d finally gotten proof that all of his friends had survived. Chef Bon had crawled out from inside the hideaway wall and started cooking for everyone, and Zuko had fallen asleep at the kotatsu between Toph and Uncle Iroh. He\u2019d felt safer than he had in years and when he woke up, he\u2019d been moved to bed and he\u2019d found out that he\u2019d slept for nearly fifteen hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t rested like that since he\u2019d been crowned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He might never rest like that again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s head hurts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think about what he\u2019s doing when he tugs the overrobe on over his pajamas, and can\u2019t manage to make himself care that he\u2019s wandering the palace barefoot. It\u2019s unseemly, his father\u2019s voice scolds in the back of his head. Unseemly and pathetic. What does he think he\u2019s doing, giving the night shift a show?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko ignores it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone awake at this hour deserves any show that they get.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko pushes open the door to the kitchen and nearly frightens Chef Bon into throwing the dough he\u2019s kneading at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d The man exclaims, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! If you needed something, you should have called for someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko waves off his concerns with a tired hand wave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t know that anyone would be awake. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chef Bon shoots him a look of concern and clicks his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to start the morning\u2019s bread, Your Majesty. Someone\u2019s always awake. You haven\u2019t slept yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chef Bon clearly thinks that it\u2019s not fine but says nothing, instead simply pushing a stool in Zuko\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me make you something, my lord. Please sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Protesting is useless, Zuko discovers, and sits where he\u2019s directed. Kitchens are never quiet either, and Zuko finds himself soothed by the noises and shuffle of Chef Bon\u2019s bustling around, and in the end he folds his arms on the counter and rests his head on them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t remember falling asleep but the next thing he knows he\u2019s jerking awake at the sound of a plate being set down next to his head. He smells ginger, honey, and grass-garlic and when Zuko opens his eyes all he can see is a small mountain of sauced noodles, sprinkled with peanuts and sliced chilis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chef Bon sets a cup of tea down next to him as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> jasmine, </em>and to Zuko\u2019s absolute horror he feels his eyes start to burn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Chef Bon asks with open alarm. Zuko doesn\u2019t want to know what his face looks like. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, is it not\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It\u2019s fine,</em>\u201d Zuko snaps harshly, and then immediately feels bad when Chef Bon\u2019s mouth shuts abruptly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you prefer another kind of tea?\u201d The man asks, very gently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want another kind of tea. He just doesn\u2019t want this one. He doesn\u2019t want any tea at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko drinks his tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hot and well-brewed but <em> wrong </em>, and Zuko smothers the taste with the noodles, pretends that his burning eyes and throat are from heat and spice instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you\u2014\u201c Zuko\u2019s voice cracks a little and he clears his throat, \u201cCan you get me some paper and something to write with, please? I need to write my uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s mid-afternoon and the <em> Jasmine Dragon </em> is bustling in its lunch rush when the hawk perches itself in the window and screeches its presence to all and sundry, scaring a pai sho tile right out of a customer\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLetter for you, boss!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iroh\u2019s not expecting a letter from Zuko for a few more days yet, but that is definitely a palace hawk and that\u2019s definitely Zuko\u2019s seal on the rolled up paper Meilin hands him. He pops the seal and scans the letter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s normal at first read, innocuous and unobtrusive. But something about it isn\u2019t right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s how many words and phrases, whole sentences, are scratched out to the point that Iroh can\u2019t even hope to read them. Maybe it\u2019s that it\u2019s arrived off schedule and Zuko\u2019s communications have been coming like clockwork, every week. Or maybe it\u2019s the way Iroh can barely recognize Zuko\u2019s writing. He\u2019s got lovely penmanship, but this is shaky and lacks composure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something is <em> wrong </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One phrase sticks out from the rest, repeated multiple times throughout Zuko\u2019s letter:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I miss you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like Zuko to be so openly vulnerable, and that combined with the rest of it sends off warning bells in Iroh\u2019s head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I miss you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iroh wasn\u2019t going to take his break until after the lunch crowd was done, but he takes off his apron and heads upstairs to his living quarters. Iroh has to pack, and he has to decide whether he wants to close the shop for a bit or leave it to his staff to manage while he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got a nephew he needs to go see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
