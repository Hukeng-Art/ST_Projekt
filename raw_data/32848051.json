  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about me. This isn\u2019t awkward for me at all. Please, carry on. I\u2019ll just sit here and watch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung unfurls himself slightly, frowning. He\u2019s got all four limbs tightly wrapped around Yoongi, vaguely reminding Jimin of an octopus. If he actually <em>were</em> an octopus, Jimin is certain the remainder of his arms would be entwined around Yoongi as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut I love him!\u201d Taehyung whines. Yoongi makes an apologetic face, slowly peeling Taehyung\u2019s left arm off his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know you do,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cBut there are no laps here for <em>me</em> to sit on, so it\u2019s making me sad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you kidding? I bet you could talk your way into the lap of any guy here in, like, five seconds flat. Hello? You\u2019re <em>you</em>.\u201d Taehyung slides the rest of the way off Yoongi, settling back down next to him in the booth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit on a random lap,\u201d Jimin says, pouting. \u201cI want to sit on a lap that loves me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNow you\u2019ve actually made him sad,\u201d Yoongi says, sighing. He nudges Taehyung with his shoulder. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry, Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung says, reaching across the table and squeezing Jimin\u2019s hand. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think a random lap would hurt.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The three of them are sitting together in a booth near the back of the White Rabbit, a huge bar that\u2019s just down the street from Jimin and Yoongi\u2019s office. It\u2019s Friday night, so it\u2019s packed with all sorts of burned-out corporate slaves, desperate to drink away the stress of the week. Jimin and Yoongi had both come straight from work, and Taehyung, Jimin\u2019s roommate, met them here a couple of hours ago.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin certainly looks the part: he\u2019s got a pair of well-worn bags under his eyes from a long week of little sleep, and his white dress shirt is rumpled, unbuttoned at the collar with both sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Anyone who didn\u2019t know him would probably just assume he\u2019s worn out after a tough week at work. What\u2019s actually weighing on his heart, though, is his disaster of a love life.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s been single for a little over two weeks now, and he\u2019s still getting used to it. He\u2019d spent the past few months in a casual relationship with Park Hyungsik, his tall and handsome coworker from the finance department. In addition to being tall and handsome, however, it turns out that Hyungsik was also a lying, cheating bag of shit. A few weeks ago, Yoongi was heading home late from the office and happened to spot Hyungsik in the parking garage, steaming up his car\u2019s windows with some guy from IT perched right in his lap.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Their relationship may not have been very serious, but it was exclusive. They\u2019d made that explicitly clear. And their agreement to exclusivity definitely did <em>not</em> include any loopholes that would allow for Hyungsik to fuck <em>any</em> members of the IT department inside his vehicle.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin ended things, of course, but Hyungsik made him feel like shit about it. He barely even apologized. And there are so many gossips working in that office building that Jimin\u2019s cheeks were permanently on fire for a full week, knowing everyone was whispering behind his back about how Hyungsik cheated on him. Speculating about <em>why</em> Hyungsik cheated on him. It was embarrassing and awful, and he\u2019s spent the past two weeks trying to convince himself that he isn\u2019t inadequate. That this wasn\u2019t his fault. That he\u2019s perfectly loveable and there\u2019s nothing wrong with him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So despite Jimin\u2019s cheeky remarks about longing for a lap, he honestly doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s anywhere near ready to find himself in another lap again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not like he was madly in love with Hyungsik or anything. But the betrayal hurt\u2014a lot\u2014and Jimin doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be ready to open himself up to someone new anytime soon, despite how good it would feel to flaunt someone else on his arm in front of Hyungsik at their next office get-together.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Tonight, he\u2019s actually feeling pretty okay, all things considered. He\u2019s several drinks deep, and he had <em>almost</em> forgotten how lonely he was\u2014at least until Taehyung decided to start essentially dry-humping Yoongi across the table.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin loves them both, and he\u2019s grateful that he was able to play matchmaker and set them up last year, but\u2026 sometimes they\u2019re a lot. More than a lot, actually.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWho wants to go buy us another round?\u201d Taehyung asks, draining the last of his wine glass. \u201cIt can\u2019t be me. I\u2019m too wobbly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you really think you should have another round if you\u2019re already too wobbly?\u201d Yoongi asks with a raised eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s actually about maintaining the perfect level of wobbliness,\u201d Taehyung explains, running a hand down Yoongi\u2019s forearm. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have another drink, my wobbliness will diminish, and I\u2019m not ready for that to happen yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can go,\u201d Jimin says with a sigh. A smile tugs at the corners of his mouth, despite himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He starts to slide out of the booth, but then he glances up and sees Yoongi\u2019s mouth fall open, his eyes focused somewhere behind Jimin, looking towards the front of the bar.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe don\u2019t,\u201d Yoongi hisses, reaching out and yanking Jimin\u2019s arm, pulling him back into the booth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jimin asks, turning around and craning his neck to see. Taehyung follows the path of Yoongi\u2019s gaze, then he pales slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin, duck,\u201d Taehyung whispers loudly. \u201cDuck down!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin says, whirling back around, understandably alarmed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat might have been a little too dramatic,\u201d Yoongi says, turning to Taehyung. \u201cYou\u2019re making it seem like he\u2019s about to be assassinated.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cEmotionally assassinated, maybe!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan someone please tell me what is going on,\u201d Jimin says flatly, looking back and forth between the two of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHyungsik just walked in,\u201d Yoongi says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s heart falls into his stomach.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He hasn\u2019t seen Hyungsik since they broke up. The finance department is three floors down from the floor that Jimin works on, and Jimin\u2019s been avoiding it like the plague, sending other coworkers on any errands that would usually bring him there.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He takes a deep breath, frowning. \u201cOkay. Well, I should probably go home anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo!\u201d Taehyung says, reaching out and grabbing Jimin\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to go yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go together,\u201d Jimin mumbles. He slides down a little bit so that the back of his head isn\u2019t visible from behind the booth. \u201cYou still remember where we live, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut what about the cab fare! We were going to split it! I can\u2019t take the subway by myself, I\u2019ll fall over and be arrested for public indecency.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRemember what I said about being dramatic,\u201d Yoongi says dryly, turning and brushing his hand briefly through Taehyung\u2019s hair.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin tosses back the rest of his gin and tonic, sighing. Maybe cutting his evening short would just be letting Hyungsik win. Maybe he deserves to have fun, too. He hasn\u2019t even gotten to dance yet\u2014the dance floor wasn\u2019t packed enough when they arrived for him to dance without feeling awkward, but it\u2019s swarming with bodies now.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Dancing alone with Hyungsik\u2019s eyes on him, though\u2026 Jimin isn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019s quite reached that level of post-breakup confidence yet.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFine,\u201d Jimin says, groaning. \u201cI\u2019ll stay. Only because I want to dance. But you have to promise to dance with me, and don\u2019t let him anywhere near me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf he gets within a ten foot radius, I\u2019ll pounce like an attack dog,\u201d Taehyung says solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll start barking. It will be very scary. He\u2019ll leave.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird,\u201d Yoongi says, plucking a maraschino cherry out of his glass and popping it into his mouth. \u201cBut like, in a hot way, I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Taehyung says, beaming.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s focus,\u201d Jimin reminds them. \u201cCan I go up to the bar now? Where is he?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yoongi leans to the right a little bit, gently colliding with the side of Taehyung\u2019s head as he peers across the large space. \u201cYou should be fine. He\u2019s sitting at a table all the way on the other side.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin says, huffing as he slips out of the booth and rises to his feet. \u201cYou just want another one of the same?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They both nod.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to go instead?\u201d Yoongi offers. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin shakes his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s so packed, I doubt he\u2019ll even see me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <em>Famous last words.</em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin squeezes his way through the crowd until he reaches the massive bar in the center, using his small stature to his advantage, wiggling between bodies until he ends up pretty close to the bar, with only one very tall woman standing between him and the bartender. He pulls out his phone and scrolls through Twitter mindlessly while he waits, running a hand through his blonde hair. Someone dims the overhead lights a little, and cheers erupt from the dance floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">After the woman ahead of him grabs her drink and ducks out of the way, Jimin steps up to the bar. The bartender closest to him, a short girl with bright blue hair, catches his eye and nods as she pours a pint. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin lists off the three drinks, then reaches into his pocket for his wallet, fishing out his credit card. He hasn\u2019t opened a tab yet\u2014Taehyung has been the one ordering drinks for everyone so far tonight.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As he\u2019s about to slide his credit card across the bar, he feels a tap on his shoulder. A second later, there\u2019s a familiar voice, low and close to his ear.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin. Hey.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin freezes, every muscle in his body tensing up.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Did Hyungsik just <em>teleport</em> here from across the room? What the fuck?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHyungsik,\u201d Jimin mumbles, barely turning to face him. Jimin keeps his eyes on the bartender. \u201cHello.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s trying to play it cool, but inside, he\u2019s completely panicking. He\u2019s got to get out of this somehow. He was never planning on speaking to Hyungsik again. He wants nothing to do with him. Being near him makes him feel ill, actually, and all the alcohol in his stomach is starting to feel a little unsettled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow are you?\u201d Hyungsik asks. He slides into the freshly vacated spot on Jimin\u2019s left, leaning against the bar. He looks obnoxiously handsome, as usual\u2014he\u2019s wearing a perfectly tailored navy suit, not a single hair out of place.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s far too close for comfort, and the way he\u2019s looking at Jimin is borderline predatory.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jimin says flatly, still staring at the bartender. She\u2019s busy taking someone else\u2019s order at the other end of the bar.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <em>Please come over here and take my credit card. Please.</em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It seems she hasn\u2019t learned how to read minds yet.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m doing well. Not that you asked,\u201d Hyungsik says coolly. \u201cI\u2019m here on a date, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">How perfectly pleasant. Jimin was just sitting in the back of the bar, whining about how lonely he is, and meanwhile, Hyungsik\u2019s already got himself a date.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A wave of hot embarrassment washes over Jimin, his cheeks flushing, but he doesn\u2019t even fully understand why. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s here <em>completely</em> alone. But he still feels like Hyungsik has bested him somehow.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow nice,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A few guys squeeze into the space to Jimin\u2019s right, trying to get the bartender\u2019s attention, shifting Jimin even closer to Hyungsik. There\u2019s nowhere for Jimin to go.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you here by yourself?\u201d Hyungsik asks, the tiniest hint of a smirk on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then Jimin does something dumb.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He isn\u2019t quite sure where the idea comes from. He does it before fully thinking it through, taking action before the thought has even finished processing in his brain, and he\u2019s just drunk enough for it to make sense\u2014for it to seem logical and not absolutely idiotic.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He swiftly turns to the right with only one goal in mind: immediately laying hands on the nearest physical body. The lucky winner is a guy wearing a flannel shirt, his back turned to Jimin. He\u2019s several inches taller than him, with broad shoulders and long, wavy hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere you are!\u201d Jimin says loudly, his eyes wide and a little crazed, his hand pressing into the small of the stranger\u2019s back. \u201cI was worried about you. You weren\u2019t texting me back. How was your day, baby?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The man slowly turns to face him. He stares down at Jimin with an absolutely perplexed expression. His eyes are already huge to begin with, but they\u2019re extra round now, his lips pursed in an unspoken question.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">With Hyungsik right behind him, Jimin can\u2019t audibly <em>tell</em> this guy what\u2019s going on, but he figures he can try to signal it with his face. So he waggles his eyebrows to the left, eyes widening further, mouth twisting to the side, desperately trying to communicate: <em>Please help me out here.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Understanding slowly dawns on the stranger\u2019s face, and Jimin lets out a tiny breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d the man says, his expression shifting into something more apologetic. \u201cI got tied up at work and forgot to text you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSuch a hard worker,\u201d Jimin coos. He shifts a bit further away from Hyungsik and closer towards the man, pressing up against his side. He silently reminds himself to apologize later for getting all handsy without asking for permission. \u201cI missed you today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The stranger quirks a smile, his eyes twinkling a little. He\u2019s very cute, actually, but Jimin is hardly concerned with that right now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce me?\u201d the man asks expectantly, glancing at Hyungsik.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOf course,\u201d Jimin says, turning to face Hyungsik. \u201cHow rude of me. Hyungsik, this is my boyfriend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The corners of his mouth twitch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin repeats. \u201cMy boyfriend. His name is...\u201d Jimin finds the stranger\u2019s foot with his own and steps on it gently, crushing the toe of his chunky sneaker under his Chelsea boot.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook,\u201d the man says, and it sounds like he\u2019s choking back a laugh. \u201cMy name is Jungkook.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hyungsik lifts his chin a little, meeting Jungkook\u2019s eye. \u201cI see. Well, I hope you\u2019re enjoying my sloppy seconds, Jungkook.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s mouth falls open.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook huffs quietly, clenching his jaw and squaring up his shoulders. He reminds Jimin of a threatened peacock, a little bit. Jimin has to give him credit\u2014he\u2019s an excellent actor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, I am much more enjoyable than you ever were,\u201d Jungkook says coolly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s mouth falls open even further.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hyungsik laughs incredulously, grabbing the beer that the bartender has just placed in front of him. \"Wow. Seems like you two really are suited for each other.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"We are,\" Jimin says, now that he's regained the ability to speak. The urge to sucker-punch Hyungsik right in the stomach is quite overwhelming. More than anything, though, he\u2019s shocked by how enthusiastically Jungkook is playing along.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\"Nice seeing you,\" Jimin says dismissively.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Seeing him was not nice. Jimin just wants him to leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hyungsik looks like he wants to say something else, but he just shakes his head a little, disappearing into the crowd.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin waits until he's out of earshot before spinning to face Jungkook, his shoulders sagging in relief. \"Thank you <em>so</em> much. That was my ex. I mean, you probably guessed that, after he said sloppy sec\u2014well, anyway. I seriously can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYour ex is an asshole,\u201d Jungkook says matter-of-factly, sipping his beer. \u201cYou should reevaluate your taste in men.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They both take a step back from the bar, making space for others to come forward and order. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Jimin mumbles. \u201cI think I\u2019ve sworn off dating for a little while.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Now that the panic swarming through Jimin\u2019s brain has died down significantly, he takes a moment to actually process Jungkook\u2019s appearance. If he <em>hadn\u2019t</em> just sworn off dating, he would probably be blushing right now. Jungkook is tall and broad, with sparkling eyes and a bright smile, and his demeanor is completely disarming\u2014Jimin feels strangely comfortable and safe around him, even though they\u2019ve barely exchanged any words at all. Jimin realizes, then, that he hasn\u2019t even told him his name.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy name is Jimin, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for touching you like that without asking first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t think you could have asked me first without blowing your cover.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. But, I mean\u2026 are you here with anyone? I don\u2019t want to have stepped on any toes\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn case you forgot, you literally and physically stepped on my toe. Kind of hard, for the record.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRight,\u201d Jimin says, wincing. \u201cSorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not here with anyone who would care,\u201d Jungkook says. He tucks some hair behind his ear. Jimin is surprised to see that his fingers are tattooed. \u201cI\u2019m just with some friends.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet me buy your next drink,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI mean, as a thank you. For helping me. Not to like, hit on you. I\u2019m not doing that. I wouldn\u2019t do that. Well, I mean, I <em>would</em>, but\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing and waving him off. \u201cI get it. But you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u2018\u201cAre you sure? I feel like I owe you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t like it when people owe me,\u201d Jungkook says, shrugging. \u201cConsider the debt already paid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. Okay. Well, thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook says, turning back towards his friends and starting to walk away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin opens his mouth to say goodbye, but then it hits him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">This isn\u2019t going to work.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook! Wait.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook turns back to face him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026 um. Can you just come back here for a second, please?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook looks a little unsure, but he takes a couple of steps back towards Jimin, leaning down to hear him better. He smells like fabric softener. \u201cYes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf\u2026 well. If you\u2019re supposed to be my boyfriend, and we were meeting up here\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2014if I go back to my table, and you go back to yours\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook blinks at him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt would be obvious I was lying,\u201d Jimin says quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh,\u201d Jungkook says, understanding. \u201cRight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s asking of Jungkook, exactly. The only thing he knows is that he would never be able to survive the embarrassment of Hyungsik discovering that he had lied.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you want me to stay here and talk to you for a little while longer?\u201d Jungkook offers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jimin says apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I feel awful about this\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jungkook says. But it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s brushing Jimin off\u2014Jimin actually believes him. \u201cYour ex seemed pretty awful. I understand why you\u2019re worried.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe is awful. He cheated on me.\u201d Jimin is not sure why he volunteers this information so readily. Jungkook is terribly easy to talk to.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook grimaces. \u201cYikes. Sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t serious. But we\u2019re coworkers, so it\u2019s made everything really awkward.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you have to see him at work every day?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin shakes his head. \u201cI work at Fila. It\u2019s a huge office building, so we don\u2019t work on the same floor. Tonight was actually the first time I\u2019ve seen him since we broke up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, you work at Fila?\u201d Jungkook asks, eyebrows raised. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy job isn\u2019t very cool,\u201d Jimin admits. \u201cI\u2019m not like a designer, or a model, or anything even half as exciting as that. I\u2019m just the assistant to the CEO.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI still think that\u2019s cool,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cYou probably get to see a lot of the company\u2019s inner workings, right? I\u2019ve always found that stuff interesting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, it can be interesting. And unpredictable. Plus, the CEO is super nice, which makes it a little more bearable.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A guy comes up behind Jungkook and taps him on the shoulder. They\u2019re around the same height, and he\u2019s just as handsome as Jungkook\u2014he has full lips, perfectly tousled hair, and the face of a model. Jimin stares for a couple of seconds longer than is probably appropriate.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey! We\u2019re going to go dance. Are you coming?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shakes his head. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The man glances over at Jimin, then stares at Jungkook suspiciously, a mischievous glint in his eye. \u201cWell, this is certainly not what I expected from you tonight, Jungkookie. I thought you said\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Jungkook says, cutting him off. \u201cThere was\u2026 um. There was a situation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook is pretending to be my boyfriend,\u201d Jimin offers helpfully. \u201cJust pretending, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, he\u2019s not doing a very good job,\u201d the man says flatly. \u201cJungkook, I\u2019ve taught you better than this, haven\u2019t I? You literally <em>live</em> with an actor, and this is the end result? You look very obviously like two people who have only just met.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, we did just meet,\u201d Jungkook says slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on, but if you want this to be believable, I\u2019m going to need you to take at least two steps closer to him\u2014whatever your name is, short businessy person\u2014and get a lot more flirty. Bat your eyelashes!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m\u2014um, okay. Thank you for the advice\u2026 tall actor person?\u201d Jimin says, his eyes slightly wide.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSeokjin,\u201d he says, bowing a little. \u201cPleased to help. Please don\u2019t actually tell me what\u2019s going on here, though, because I have no desire to know. I\u2019m going to go dance with my boyfriend now. Goodbye.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin laughs, and after the stress of his encounter with Hyungsik, he can physically feel some tension melting away as he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019s probably right,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cHe is an actor. He didn\u2019t make that part up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks, wondering which part he <em>did</em> make up.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook takes a couple of steps forward, right into Jimin\u2019s space, so close that Jimin can see the faint pilling of the fabric on his plaid flannel shirt.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt would probably be better if I\u2026\u201d he trails off, slipping one arm around Jimin\u2019s waist, fingers splaying out across the small of Jimin\u2019s back. \u201cThis is good. Right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. He\u2019s had enough drinks to feel slightly unsteady on his feet, and it feels nice to have a big, steadying hand on him. Especially a big, steadying hand attached to someone this cute\u2014as meaningless as it is.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin looks up at him. He\u2019s close enough to count Jungkook\u2019s eyelashes, if he wanted to. \u201cYeah, this is good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. Cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re silent for a moment. It should probably be awkward, but it feels fine. Good, even.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo, where do you work?\u201d Jimin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you think your job is boring, mine will put you to sleep,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. He has a very kind face. \u201cI\u2019m a developer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLike, you code stuff?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cWebsites. I work at a small agency that\u2019s just a few blocks away from here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd you get to dress like that for work?\u201d Jimin asks, eyeing Jungkook\u2019s flannel and cargo pants. He stares down at his own outfit\u2014his rumpled dress shirt, his fitted grey slacks, his shiny boots. He looks awfully stuffy in comparison.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. The nice thing about working in tech is that everything is more casual,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cThe dress code isn\u2019t strict, and I never interact with our clients, so they don\u2019t care about my tattoos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin glances at the tattooed fingers wrapped around Jungkook\u2019s beer glass. \u201cHow many do you have?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI stopped counting a couple of years ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA lot, then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cA whole sleeve. Plus some others.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhere?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks rapidly, his cheeks flushing. \u201cHow am I meant to find out\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, sorry,\u201d Jungkook says sheepishly, his palm rubbing up Jimin\u2019s back a little. Jimin has to resist the urge to shiver. \u201cI may have taken this role-playing scenario slightly too far.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I do appreciate your commitment to the role,\u201d Jimin says, his eyes crinkling at the corners.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t have Seokjin kicking me out of my own home. I\u2019m feeling the pressure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have tattoos too, actually,\u201d Jimin says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook asks, sounding genuinely surprised.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hums, holding up his wrist. At work, this one is usually covered by his long-sleeved dress shirts, but he has his sleeves rolled up now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPretty,\u201d Jungkook murmurs. \u201cYou said tattoos\u2014plural. There are more?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to find out,\u201d Jimin says teasingly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pokes at the inside of his cheek with his tongue. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is cut off by a large hand clamping down on his shoulder. He jumps slightly. It\u2019s Taehyung, his dark, wavy hair sticking out in a million different directions. \u201cJimin! There you are. Yoongi sent me on a search and rescue mission. What are you\u2026\u201d he trails off, glancing down and noticing Jungkook\u2019s arm around Jimin\u2019s waist. His eyebrows furrow.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry. I ran into Hyungsik while I was up at the bar,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI was so focused on getting away from him that I didn\u2019t even end up paying for our drinks. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t care about the drinks,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI am actually more interested in hearing about...\u201d he wildly gesticulates in Jungkook\u2019s direction, nearly whacking Jimin in the face as he does it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m pretending to be his boyfriend,\u201d Jungkook says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI sort of, um, accosted him,\u201d Jimin explains. \u201cI acted like he was my boyfriend so that Hyungsik would leave me alone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Oh</em>,\u201d Taehyung says, nodding in understanding. \u201cSo now you\u2019re committing to the bit?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They both nod.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy are you helping him?\u201d Taehyung asks Jungkook, his eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for you? Jimin isn\u2019t ready to date again yet, you know. And he doesn\u2019t do one night stands. So if you think you\u2019re going to get in his\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s cheeks turn a little pink and he rushes to cut Taehyung off. \u201cNo, I, um\u2014that\u2019s not why. I\u2019m not interested in that right now, actually. I just felt kind of bad for him because his ex was really rude.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, good. I love being pitied. Thank you,\u201d Jimin says flatly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung bursts out laughing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, no, no, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d Jungkook stammers, eyes round above his beer glass. \u201cI don\u2019t pity you. Not at all. I just meant I\u2014I wanted to help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d Jimin says, tilting his head and smiling. Jungkook\u2019s shoulders immediately relax.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo you\u2019re going to hang out with my Jiminie for the rest of the evening, then? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have to do. Otherwise, Hyungsik will know you\u2019re faking.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is starting to feel a little guilty. When he\u2019d grabbed Jungkook in the midst of his panic, he only figured Jungkook would need to help him out for a few minutes max. He didn\u2019t fully think this through. How can he reasonably ask this complete stranger to ditch his friends for the night and hang out with him instead? He can\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy friends are annoying,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling sweetly, as if he\u2019s reading Jimin\u2019s mind. \u201cYou have no idea. I should be thanking you for giving me a convenient excuse to escape them tonight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSeokjin didn\u2019t seem annoying,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHe seemed\u2026 entertaining.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love him. But I\u2019m only here with him and his boyfriend, so I\u2019m like the third wheel, and it can sometimes be really awkward, because they\u2019re really\u2026 well. Let\u2019s just say they love each other a lot. Also, I live with him, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m starved for his attention. Trust me. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know exactly the type of couple you mean,\u201d Jimin says dryly, turning to look at Taehyung.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung gasps. \u201cJimin, we have literally invited you into our bedroom. The door is always open\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s eyebrows shoot up.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think now is the time to discuss that!\u201d Jimin says brightly, reaching up to pinch Taehyung\u2019s cheek. \u201cPlease go tell Yoongi I\u2019m fine. And order drinks, I guess, if you want. Sorry for abandoning you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll be watching you,\u201d Taehyung says to Jungkook ominously.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Then he makes his way up to the bar, leaving them alone again. At Jimin\u2019s request, Jungkook tells him more about Seokjin and the variety of roles he\u2019s been cast in, mostly minor roles in cable dramas. He never removes his hand from Jimin\u2019s back, continuously rubbing his palm in small, slow circles. Jimin feels sort of like a cat being stroked\u2014it feels good, and it\u2019s physically relaxing him, and he knows he\u2019s arching into the touch, which he hopes Jungkook doesn\u2019t read into too much.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung reappears behind Jungkook after only a few minutes, reaching past him to hand Jimin a double gin and tonic. Jimin blinks in surprise, accepting it gratefully.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI figured you might need another drink to deal with\u2026 this situation,\u201d Taehyung says, glancing at Jungkook meaningfully.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Jungkook asks, his eyebrows furrowed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNothing. Just that Jimin does better with some extra lubrication in unorthodox social situations.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy are we talking about lubrication?\u201d Jimin groans, taking a big sip of his drink.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt least dance with him,\u201d Taehyung says, ignoring the question and turning to Jungkook. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like Jimin is getting his money\u2019s worth right now. That bothers me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI didn't <em>pay</em> him, Taehyung.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was speaking metaphorically.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d Jungkook says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Behind Jimin, someone squeezes up towards the bar, pushing Jimin in closer towards Jungkook\u2019s body. Jungkook seems unbothered\u2014he just tightens his arm further around Jimin\u2019s waist.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It feels nice. Being touched by Jungkook, being this close to him\u2014Jimin is <em>surprised</em> by how nice it feels. How easy it is. Jimin thinks that dancing with Jungkook would probably be a lot of fun.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung is gone when Jimin looks up again, presumably to deliver drinks to Yoongi back at their booth. Jimin places a hand flat against Jungkook\u2019s chest, and he can feel the sharp inhale that immediately follows. Jimin doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. He surprised him, maybe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His chest is solid and muscular. The baggy flannel was doing a pretty good job of keeping that a secret. But now Jimin knows. He silently reminds himself that this is useless information.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI want to dance,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cAnd since you are my fake boyfriend, it feels appropriate for you to dance with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you just want to dance, or do you want to put on a show?\u201d Jungkook asks, his eyes twinkling.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Okay, dancing with Jungkook will <em>definitely</em> be a lot of fun.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s eyes flicker over to the dance floor behind Jungkook. He can see Hyungsik near the far edge, now minus his suit jacket, and some scrawny little guy is grinding on him, arms looped around his neck\u2014his date, presumably.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s put on a show,\u201d Jimin says, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s hand and tugging him onto the dance floor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin isn\u2019t necessarily expecting Jungkook to be a very good dancer, but he takes the lead easily, his hands low on Jimin\u2019s hips, pulling him in close. It\u2019s easy and effortless, and more than anything, it\u2019s <em>fun\u2014</em>the DJ is playing song after song after song, but Jimin doesn\u2019t feel like much time has passed at all<em>. </em>He\u2019s losing himself to the music, just perfectly drunk enough to feel warm and buzzy and careless, and he all but forgets about the unpleasant situation that\u2019s led him to dance with Jungkook in the first place. His world has narrowed down to the heavy thrum of the bass, the flashing lights above them, and the feeling of Jungkook\u2019s warm, solid body against him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook seems like he\u2019s having fun, too. He\u2019s all bright smiles and laughter and gentle touches, eyes solely focused on Jimin as they move perfectly in sync. Any outsider who glanced at the two of them would definitely assume that they were in love. Jimin can\u2019t believe he\u2019s picked such an excellent fake boyfriend. He\u2019s rather proud of himself, actually.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs he looking?\u201d Jungkook murmurs into Jimin\u2019s ear after a while, pulling him in so close that their bodies are pressed together, front to front. Jimin tilts his head, gazing over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder lazily.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hyungsik meets Jimin\u2019s eye from across the dance floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cStaring,\u201d Jimin replies, winding his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm. Should we give him something to stare at, then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles up at him, playful and catlike.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Thanks to the alcohol buzzing through his bloodstream and the thrill of having Jungkook\u2019s hands all over him, this is starting to feel less like a catastrophe and more like a game.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t say anything in response. Instead, he spins 180 degrees, backing up until their bodies are pressed together again and he\u2019s grinding his ass against Jungkook\u2019s front. Jungkook makes a strangled little noise in his ear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hums in satisfaction. Jungkook\u2019s hands land on his waist, smoothing over the fabric of his dress shirt and skating along the top of his pants. Jimin can feel him breathing against his ear, warm and fast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis seems fairly convincing,\u201d Jungkook says quietly. His voice is rumbly, about an octave lower than before, tickling the shell of Jimin\u2019s ear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm. Well, you\u2019re an excellent actor. In fact, I think you\u2019re probably giving Seokjin a run for his money,\u201d Jimin purrs, rolling his hips again to the beat. Jungkook\u2019s grip on his waist tightens. \u201cThe Academy Award goes to\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t let him hear you say that,\u201d Jungkook says, puffing out a tiny laugh. \u201cAlso, stop acting like I\u2019m the one doing all the work. I\u2019d say you\u2019re contributing just as much to our little ruse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAm I?\u201d Jimin murmurs, reaching a hand back to comb through Jungkook\u2019s hair. It\u2019s soft. \u201cWell, it\u2019s only fair that I do my part. I\u2019m the one who dragged you into this, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI do appreciate your commitment,\u201d Jungkook says. He leans forward, nosing along Jimin\u2019s jaw. Jimin stops breathing for a moment. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a long time since I danced with anyone even half as fun as you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI mean, I had to <em>somehow</em> make it worth your while.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou did,\u201d Jungkook murmurs against Jimin\u2019s skin, lips brushing against his jaw. Jimin shivers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is liking this a little more than he expected, but he reminds himself that this is probably just a normal physical reaction to this kind of proximity. And that\u2019s a good thing\u2014the more into it he is, the more natural it will appear from the outside.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As he pushes back against Jungkook, leaning his weight into him as Jungkook\u2019s palms skate up his sides, Jimin discovers he\u2019s definitely not the only one enjoying himself. Not at all. There\u2019s something suspiciously hard pressing right against his ass. It sends a thrill straight through him, making his stomach flutter.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It means he\u2019s doing a good job. But it also means he\u2019s teetering a dangerous line.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin spins around, looping his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck again, and Jungkook stares at him with a face that clearly reveals he knows he\u2019s busted.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, don\u2019t <em>you</em> look like the cat who ate the canary,\u201d Jimin sing-songs, fingertips dancing along the nape of Jungkook\u2019s neck. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo one would be able to survive what you just did to me,\u201d Jungkook says, pouting. It\u2019s a sharp contrast to the low timbre of his voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Jimin murmurs, scratching at Jungkook\u2019s scalp a little. He can\u2019t help himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs he still looking at you?\u201d Jungkook asks quietly. The bass thumps loudly in Jimin\u2019s ears, nearly drowning him out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin peers over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder again. Hyungsik isn\u2019t in the spot where Jimin saw him last. There\u2019s a rowdy group of girls there now, all jumping up and down and screaming along to the song that\u2019s currently playing. Jimin\u2019s eyes scan across the crowd, and then he realizes with a jolt\u2014Hyungsik is much closer to them now. There are only a few bodies between them. His date is still grinding on him very enthusiastically. Hyungsik\u2019s eyes are closed, but then they flutter open, and he looks right at Jimin, a tiny smirk forming on his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The eye contact isn\u2019t pleasant. Jimin quickly turns his head, looking up at Jungkook again. He\u2019d much rather feel the warmth of Jungkook\u2019s gaze on him instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot closer to us now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you still care what he thinks?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin swallows. He decides to respond honestly, even though he wishes the answer wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, it seems like he wanted a better view,\u201d Jungkook says. His hands slide up Jimin\u2019s back, and Jimin hums. \u201cSo maybe your plan is working.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat was my plan, exactly?\u201d Jimin asks hazily.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t care about making him jealous,\u201d Jimin admits. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want him to think that I was alone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d Jungkook says, almost too softly for Jimin to hear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin stares up at him. His eyes are big enough to get lost in, mesmerizing and dark and slightly half-lidded. Jungkook\u2019s looking at him with such an earnest expression that Jimin momentarily forgets how to speak. He can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at him like that\u2014like they were willing to share all their secrets without a second thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>You swore off men</em>, Jimin silently reminds himself. <em>This is just pretend. And he\u2019s just pretending, like all the rest.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As long as he remembers that, everything will be fine.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin allows himself to go molten underneath Jungkook\u2019s hands again, warmth spreading everywhere he touches. He allows himself to enjoy this for exactly what it is: a ruse, and nothing more.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you think he\u2019s convinced?\u201d Jimin asks, cocking his head. \u201cThat you\u2019re my boyfriend?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat depends,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cHow convinced do you want him to be?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s gaze flickers down to Jimin\u2019s lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cVery,\u201d Jimin murmurs quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re barely dancing anymore, but Jimin doesn\u2019t care much. He hardly notices the bodies jostling them on all sides, dancing and laughing and pushing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook lifts a hand to Jimin\u2019s face, cupping his cheek. Jimin tilts his chin up, leaning into the touch. Their noses brush. Neither of them move.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs this more convincing?\u201d Jungkook breathes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cProbably,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cConvincing enough, then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm,\u201d Jungkook says, his thumb tracing over Jimin\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very demanding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still playing along.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Their noses brush again. Jimin fists Jungkook\u2019s flannel in both hands, squeezing the fabric bunched together in his palms. There\u2019s nothing but hard body underneath. It\u2019s hot in here, and Jimin can feel how warm Jungkook is through the cotton. It\u2019s a radiating heat. But it\u2019s not unpleasant.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, I guess I am.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo then you must be having fun,\u201d Jimin murmurs, tilting his chin up further. The blue and purple lights above the dance floor reflect in Jungkook\u2019s eyes like tiny stars.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s thumb roams further down, gently tracing over Jimin\u2019s bottom lip. Jungkook pushes against it. Jimin\u2019s mouth falls open a little, his breath catching in his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood?\u201d Jungkook asks, breath hot against Jimin\u2019s cheek.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cKiss me,\u201d Jimin whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles a small, knowing smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOnly if it\u2019s pretend,\u201d he says, searching Jimin\u2019s eyes. Jimin nods\u2014perhaps a little too enthusiastically.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That seems to be all the confirmation Jungkook needs. He leans in, closing the tiny bit of remaining distance between them, lips pressing into Jimin\u2019s, gentle fingers cupping his jaw.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s mouth is soft, and kissing him is easy, just like all the rest of this has been. It\u2019s not logical, but it feels like the right thing to do. Jungkook hums against Jimin\u2019s mouth, like he\u2019s agreeing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s slow and cautious at first, neither of them sure how far to take it. They\u2019re playing a game with no rulebook. But Jimin\u2019s brain is chanting at him: <em>more, more, more, </em>so he tentatively sweeps his tongue across Jungkook\u2019s bottom lip, and Jungkook reciprocates, opening up to let him in.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin sighs into his mouth, and Jungkook\u2019s hand trails around to the back of Jimin\u2019s head, fingers tangling in his hair. He pulls a little, tilting Jimin\u2019s head back for better access.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin should probably not be surprised that his hot, charming, perfect fake boyfriend is also fantastic at kissing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s also fantastic at pretending, apparently.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMore?\u201d Jungkook murmurs, his other hand trailing down, fingertips grazing along the curve of Jimin\u2019s ass. Jimin nearly moans, but he swallows it down, nipping on Jungkook\u2019s bottom lip instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling against him. He grips Jimin\u2019s ass more firmly, cupping it in his hand, and Jimin arches his back, winding his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck, and then\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAlright, loverboys, the show\u2019s over.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin yanks back, frantically searching for the source of the voice in a daze. It\u2019s Taehyung, looking very drunk, hovering so close to Jimin\u2019s shoulder that he\u2019s nearly got his head perched on top of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook hesitantly removes both hands from Jimin, taking a step back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re going home,\u201d Taehyung announces. \u201cWhich means you have to come too, because we\u2019re splitting the cab fare.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. Right,\u201d Jimin says, trying not to sound winded. He\u2019s embarrassingly out of breath. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs he coming too?\u201d Taehyung asks, turning to look at Jungkook meaningfully. As if this couldn\u2019t possibly get any more awkward.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, no,\u201d Jimin and Jungkook both say at the same time. Taehyung stares back and forth between them, one eyebrow raised.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re both silent for a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess your work here is done,\u201d Jimin says, completely unsure of how to wrap up this sort of thing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess so,\u201d Jungkook says, running a hand through his hair, which is very messy now. He blows out a breath. \u201cYeah. Okay. Get home safe, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Taehyung starts to pull Jimin away by the arm, and after a moment of looking quite uncertain, Jungkook turns to walk away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin suddenly feels a fleeting sense of panic. This is it? That can\u2019t be right. He\u2019ll never see Jungkook again?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But it <em>is</em> right, and that stings, although it shouldn\u2019t. There would be no reason for him to see Jungkook again. None of what just happened was real. He was just a stranger. They both played the parts they were cast in, and now the play is over.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks, allowing himself to be dragged across the dance floor and towards the back of the bar.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat didn\u2019t look very fake to me,\u201d Taehyung says under his breath, finally loosening his grip once they arrive back at their booth. Yoongi is sitting there, staring up at the two of them with a suspiciously neutral face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat just means we were doing a good job,\u201d Jimin says defensively.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUh huh,\u201d Taehyung says, reaching out a hand to help Yoongi up. \u201cHyungsik was staring at you every time I looked at him, so I guess it worked.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess so,\u201d Jimin mumbles. He desperately needs another drink.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTaehyung filled me in on your little scheme,\u201d Yoongi says as he rises to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite impressed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you. I think,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was complimented on\u2026 um, on a scheme.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you bringing him to the company gala next week, too, then?\u201d Yoongi asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Every single one of Jimin\u2019s thoughts comes crashing to a sudden halt. His brain makes the Windows shut-down noise and goes dark. He blinks as he fully registers Yoongi\u2019s words.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe gala,\u201d he says slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes. I mean\u2014did you not think about that? Hyungsik will expect this guy to be your plus one, if he\u2019s supposedly your boyfriend. If you show up alone\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t hear the rest. He\u2019s already dashing across the bar, frantically searching for that blue flannel shirt in the crowd.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Shit. <em>Shit.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He emerges on the other side of the dance floor and scans the booths lining the far wall, pushing up onto his tip-toes. The bar is so packed that it\u2019s nearly impossible to see, and he\u2019s about to give up, but then he sees him\u2014he\u2019s just about to sit down, joining Seokjin and another guy who is already seated on the opposite side of the booth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin breathes out a sigh of relief, and then he quickly walks over, only realizing once he arrives in front of their booth that it probably would have been beneficial for him to spend at least, like, five seconds considering what he was going to say beforehand.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As he approaches, Jungkook looks up at him with round eyes and a mix of surprise and something else on his face that Jimin can\u2019t quite figure out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi,\u201d Jimin says. He clears his throat. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. Okay, sure,\u201d Jungkook says, moving to slide back out of the booth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Seokjin reaches out, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s arm and pinning it to the table.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCertainly there\u2019s nothing you need to say to him that you can\u2019t say here in front of us,\u201d Seokjin proclaims, setting his beer down. \u201cYou stole my Jungkook for the entire evening, and I\u2019m quite bitter about it. I\u2019ve had to wait all this time to tell him about my latest expedition, and now you\u2019re interrupting again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cExpedition?\u201d Jimin asks, blinking.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes. To the fish market.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin decides not to ask questions. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t say here, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think you\u2019re being a little scary,\u201d the man across the table pipes up cheerfully, reaching out to pat Seokjin\u2019s arm lovingly. \u201cLet Jungkook have his fun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cActing isn\u2019t all fun and games, you know!\u201d Seokjin says, turning to face Jimin. \u201cIf Jungkook had merely asked me for advice, I would have told him\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the other man says to Jimin, reaching out and yanking him down until he\u2019s forced to sit down in the booth, butt sliding across the cool wood as he settles in next to whom he assumes must be Seokjin\u2019s boyfriend. \u201cThis is just how he is. And I enjoy it, for some reason. I am not sure why. Anyway, please ask Jungkook whatever you needed to ask him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin glances at Jungkook across the table. He looks terribly apologetic.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin feels like he could either burst into panicked tears or hysterical laughter at any moment, but he\u2019s not sure which.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell,\u201d Jimin says, clearing his throat again. \u201cI realized something. After we, um\u2026 said goodbye.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat you\u2019re in love with him? You\u2019re going to have to join the other fifty men lined up around his apartment block,\u201d Seokjin says flatly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo\u2014no, it\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d Jimin rushes to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 there\u2019s a gala I have to attend next week. And it\u2019s a work thing, so my ex will be there. I didn\u2019t think about it until my friend, um, my coworker, he said something. And it\u2019s just\u2014we\u2019re supposed to bring a plus one, and if I show up by myself, I think it would be\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d Jungkook says with a tiny shrug, cutting him off.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI said I\u2019ll come.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cOkay. Um, cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The guy sitting next to Jimin shoots a look across the table at Seokjin that Jimin doesn\u2019t quite know how to translate.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d Seokjin demands. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this arrangement. Isn\u2019t this rather one-sided? Perhaps you should consider charging him by the hour, Jungkook. You never were a very good businessman. There\u2019s so much you could learn from me. Too bad you abandoned me tonight. Maybe don\u2019t do that ever again. I don\u2019t think you can afford it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to charge him,\u201d Jungkook says. The sleeves of his flannel are rolled up to the elbows now, revealing a full sleeve of tattoos on his right arm. Jimin fleetingly wonders about the other ones he mentioned. Maybe he has one on his shoulder? Or on his thigh?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> <em>That\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.</em> </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He blinks away the thought. This is not a thought that he should be thinking at all. He does not need to know if his fake boyfriend has a thigh tattoo.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI had fun with you tonight,\u201d Jungkook says. He looks a little shy all of a sudden. \u201cEven if it was just pretend. So I don\u2019t mind helping you again. I think you\u2019re right that it would be suspicious\u2014I mean, if you showed up to your party alone, when you\u2019re supposed to have a boyfriend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes. Exactly,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI\u2019m glad you agree.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen is it?\u201d Jungkook asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNext Saturday. It starts at five, I think. I\u2019ll have to check the email.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo I need to dress up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. \u201cYou can wear a suit, if you have one. Otherwise, just a dress shirt and tie would be okay. Nice pants. Like what you\u2019d wear to an office.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s just starting to sober up enough that he\u2019s beginning to get sleepy. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s chatting with Jungkook about office apparel. This evening has certainly taken a turn.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust give him your number already,\u201d Seokjin says, grabbing a cocktail napkin and shoving it across the table towards Jimin. He whips out a pen from\u2014well, Jimin isn\u2019t exactly sure where.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin agrees, becoming increasingly more terrified of Seokjin with every passing second. He scrawls his number onto the napkin in a hurry, then passes it back across the table to Jungkook. Their fingers brush as Jungkook takes it, and then he folds it up carefully, sticking it into his shirt\u2019s front pocket.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m Hoseok, by the way,\u201d the guy sitting next to Jimin says. He sticks out his hand, and Jimin shakes it awkwardly. \u201cSeokjin will warm up to you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t anticipate that I\u2019d ever have the chance to,\u201d Seokjin says, his eyebrows furrowed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Jimin says cheerfully, sliding out of the booth with great haste. \u201cJungkook, text me this week, okay? I\u2019ll send you everything you need to know about the gala. And\u2026 thank you. For this, and for tonight. I owe you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shakes his head. \u201cRemember what I said about owing me? You don\u2019t owe me anything. If I didn\u2019t want to help you, I wouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSuch a philanthropist,\u201d Seokjin says, sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou make it sound like Jimin is a charity case,\u201d Hoseok says, frowning.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, he\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Jimin says. He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s kidding. He might not be.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a beat of awkward silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d Jungkook says, graciously giving Jimin permission to escape.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWait. The boy is looking,\u201d Seokjin says as Jimin is about to turn and walk away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin asks, his heartbeat accelerating. He\u2019s scared to turn around. \u201cHow do you even know who\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook doesn\u2019t even look. He just reaches out and grabs Jimin\u2019s hand, pulling it to his mouth and kissing his palm briefly before letting go.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere you go. A slightly more believable goodbye,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin feels dizzy. He pulls his hand back, flexing his fingers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Seokjin bursts into laughter, wheezing and windshield-wipery. They all turn to stare at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019s not looking. I was just fucking with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s cheeks go pink. He smacks Seokjin on the shoulder, frowning. \u201cThis is serious! Don\u2019t be an asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, please. You\u2019ll both live. A little hand kiss never hurt anyone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook glares at him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, sorry, <em>sorry</em>. I just wanted to see how committed you were. You passed the test. I\u2019m kind of surprised.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe is an amazing fake boyfriend,\u201d Jimin says defensively. \u201cThe best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHave you had multiple fake boyfriends?\u201d Hoseok asks, raising his eyebrows.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Seokjin hums like Jimin has just said something reprehensible.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m going to go,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles at him apologetically. \u201cOkay. Get home safe. You\u2019re going with your friends?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNice meeting you!\u201d Hoseok says with a bright smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook gives him a lingering look\u2014one that could mean something, if it did, although Jimin knows it doesn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then Jimin is out of there, riding home in a cab with a clingy Taehyung, running fingers through Jimin\u2019s hair and cooing about how badly he wants some ramyeon once they get home.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is confused, and a little stressed, but he feels like he\u2019s just successfully pulled off the greatest heist of the twenty-first century.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"s2\">\u3000</span> <span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span> <span class=\"s2\">\u3000</span> <span class=\"s1\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ended up happening to the call later? The one with the investors?\u201d Namjoon asks, eyes flickering back and forth between his two computer screens as he rapidly types away on his keyboard. He\u2019s wearing a navy suit today, his hair neatly combed back off his forehead, trademark wire-framed glasses perched on his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still happening today, but it was bumped to 4:30,\u201d Jimin says. He\u2019s sitting with his legs crossed at one of the two tables in Namjoon\u2019s large office, blonde hair falling down into his eyes, scanning through a contract and highlighting all the points he wants Namjoon to review. \u201cI sent you an updated calendar invite a few minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Namjoon says. He sounds distracted. \u201cAlso, sorry\u2014did you talk to the events team about the gala? About the plants?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Jimin says. He can feel a smile creeping onto his face, but Namjoon would give him hell if he saw him smirking about this, so he tries to mask it as best as he can. \u201cThey weren\u2019t happy, but in the end, what you say goes. I gave them three different leads for real ferns. They shouldn\u2019t have much trouble sourcing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Namjoon says, rolling back in his desk chair and wiping a hand down his face. \u201cI would have been so mortified. I\u2019m <em> so </em> glad you saw the purchase order. This is why you\u2019re never allowed to quit\u2014this place would fall apart without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The theme of this year\u2019s company gala is <em> Growth/Renewal</em>, and the decor is nature-inspired: bright and airy with lots of greenery and plants. Namjoon said he wanted everyone to feel like they were in a rainforest or a jungle. Jimin thinks this is actually just a thinly veiled excuse for Namjoon to spend an evening surrounded by plants, but the theme seems nice enough.</p>\n<p>When Jimin was thumbing through a pile of documents that needed Namjoon\u2019s approval, he spotted a purchase order for over 200 artificial ferns. Fake plants. Jimin had nearly choked on his coffee. They were probably ordered by some intern in the events department who doesn\u2019t know anything about Namjoon or his\u2026 well, his quirks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin brought it to Namjoon\u2019s attention, as he was obligated to do, and when he showed Namjoon the order, Namjoon\u2019s face was painted with such comical horror that you\u2019d think the intern had committed murder. To Namjoon, actually, buying plastic trees was far worse than that.</p>\n<p>It was all sorted out in the end. Jimin gave the events team a heads up about their grave mistake, and he even went the extra mile and researched a few places they might be able to find some real plants that were similar to the fake ones they\u2019d ordered. With the gala quickly approaching on Saturday, he caught the mistake in the nick of time.</p>\n<p>It might seem like Jimin went out of his way to fix the plant catastrophe because he\u2019s a stellar employee\u2014and sure, maybe he is\u2014but his actual motivation was rather selfish. Jimin spends about 50% of each workday right by Namjoon\u2019s side, and if Namjoon is happy, then Jimin\u2019s days are much easier.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Namjoon is difficult to work with when he\u2019s <em> not </em> happy. He seems to be much more kind and easygoing than the other CEOs Jimin has encountered during the course of his work at Fila. But when he\u2019s having a good day, he tends to ask Jimin for less, which means Jimin has more time for all the other work he needs to get done.</p>\n<p>This particular Monday has been busier than usual, with multiple appointments that needed rescheduling to accommodate Namjoon\u2019s ever-changing schedule, plus a slew of documents for Jimin to comb through related to an upcoming round of investment funding for one of Fila\u2019s subsidiaries. His brain is already halfway to fried and he hasn\u2019t even taken his lunch break yet.</p>\n<p>When Jimin tells people that he\u2019s Namjoon\u2019s assistant, they often assume he\u2019s something like a secretary\u2014taking care of Namjoon\u2019s dry cleaning, bringing him coffee, doting on his every need. In reality, it\u2019s nothing like that at all. Jimin has a business degree and previous experience in the corporate world, and Namjoon wanted an assistant who would do more than just wait on him hand and foot\u2014he wanted a confidant, a consultant, a jack-of-all-trades with a brain big enough to help him with literally <em> anything </em> he needed. And for the past two years, Jimin has done exactly that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten lunch yet, have you?\u201d Namjoon asks, glancing down at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jimin admits, scanning through the final page of the contract and sorting the papers in front of him into a neat stack. \u201cI lost track of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go eat? The paperwork will still be here when you get back, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>On cue, Jimin\u2019s stomach grumbles loudly. Jimin winces. \u201cYeah, I probably should eat something. You need anything before I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon shakes his head, taking his glasses off and setting them on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ll be busy this afternoon\u2014I\u2019ve got a few calls. Just pop back in here before the meeting at 4:30, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cWill do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>After dropping the freshly highlighted contract onto Namjoon\u2019s desk, Jimin heads out of Namjoon\u2019s office, then down the hall to his own office, which is much smaller and far less sunny. There\u2019s barely enough room for his desk and a single chair in the corner. It could be worse, he figures\u2014at least he has a window, even if it\u2019s small. There are lots of offices in the building with no windows at all.</p>\n<p>He shrugs off his gray suit jacket, rolling his shoulders and throwing the jacket over the back of his desk chair. Then he picks up his cell phone off his desk, planning to order some food for delivery. He\u2019d been in too much of a rush this morning to pack his lunch like he normally does.</p>\n<p>When the screen lights up, he almost ignores the long list of notifications that have accumulated since this morning, but then something catches his eye\u2014a few texts from an unknown number that isn\u2019t in his contact list.</p>\n<p>He swipes up on the notification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>+011-0901-0613 </b>12:23PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> hey, it\u2019s jungkook. from the bar </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>+011-0901-0613 </b>12:24PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> your fake boyfriend </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin stares down at the messages in surprise. After Sunday came and went without a text, Jimin honestly wasn\u2019t sure if Jungkook was going to message him. He was starting to think maybe Jungkook regretted saying he\u2019d come as Jimin\u2019s date to the gala. Jimin had purposely left the ball in Jungkook\u2019s court\u2014he\u2019d asked a lot of him, after all, and he didn\u2019t want to be too pushy about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But now the ball has been returned, and Jimin is happier about that than he anticipated. He\u2019s borderline giddy, actually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s probably bad. He shakes his head, frowning. He does not need to develop a crush on his fake boyfriend. He barely knows anything about him, anyway. Just that he\u2019s a web developer, and probably smart, and <em> definitely </em> hot, and very good at kissing, and also willingly pretending to be dating him. Jimin hasn\u2019t managed to figure out that part quite yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook probably has some skeleton in the closet that makes him undateable, Jimin thinks. Why would he be single, otherwise? Maybe he\u2019s a convicted felon. Maybe he\u2019s in the witness protection program and doesn\u2019t allow himself to get too close to anyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin adds Jungkook\u2019s number to his contact list, entering him in as \u201c<em>boyfriend\u201d </em> with a sparkly heart emoji.</p>\n<p>He chews on the inside of his cheek for a moment, pondering how to respond. The temptation to flirt is overwhelming. But that\u2019s unnecessary\u2014no one is watching their text conversation, after all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ends up firing off a single message: <em> wow, you actually texted me</em>. Less than a minute later, his phone lights up with another notification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:03PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> did you think i wouldn\u2019t? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:04PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i mean, kind of? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:04PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that\u2019s offensive. i\u2019m a man of my word </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:05PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> sorry to offend you, mr. honorable. i guess i need to stay on your good side if i still want you to accompany me to the gala </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:07PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that\u2019s why i texted you. can you send me the info? like, the address and time and stuff? also, it would be nice to know what it is, exactly? those of us who aren\u2019t corporate hotshots don\u2019t attend galas very frequently </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:09PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> yeah, i\u2019ll check the email invite later and send everything over. it\u2019s our annual celebration for employees\u2026 it\u2019s basically just a wild party with a fancy dress code. there\u2019s dinner and drinks and dancing, and they give out awards, which is kind of fun, but it\u2019s mainly an excuse for everyone to get really drunk\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:10PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that actually doesn\u2019t sound as bad as i thought it was going to be </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:11PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i\u2019m happy to hear you assumed that being my date was going to be a bad time </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:11PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that is not what i meant and you know it\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:12PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i did not know it. in fact, i hardly know you at all. which may prove to be problematic when i am parading you around in front of all my coworkers and they start to ask me questions about you </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:13PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> just make up the answers! that\u2019s more fun anyway </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:13PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i was going to suggest that i ask you a few questions to get to know you better but i suppose that\u2019s also an alternative </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:15PM</p>\n<p><em> jimin, where did your boyfriend grow up? \u201con mars\u201d </em><br>\n<em> jimin, how did you meet your boyfriend? \u201cin a sex shop. he was the cashier. i was buying a dildo. it was fate i think\u201d </em> <em><br>\njimin, how old is your boyfriend? \u201che\u2019s 85. love has no age limit\u201d</em></p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:15PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> wait, how old are you actually? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:16PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i\u2019m 24 </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:16PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> ah. just a baby </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:17PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i feel much older. life is exhausting </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:17PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> aren\u2019t you going to ask how old i am? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:18PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> wasn\u2019t planning on it </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:18PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i\u2019m 26 </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:18PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> thank you for sharing </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:19PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i don\u2019t remember you being this sassy when we were at the bar </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:20PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> really? maybe that\u2019s because you were drunk </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:20PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i wasn\u2019t THAT drunk </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:21PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i mean, you were drunk enough to make out with me and let me grab your butt </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:22PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> oh so we\u2019re just going to\u2026 acknowledge that. i assumed we would never discuss that again </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:23PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> it\u2019s only awkward if you make it awkward! which you kind of are, now! thank you! </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:24PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> you\u2019re welcome. let\u2019s keep the ass grabbing to a minimum at my company function. i have a reputation to uphold </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:25PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that\u2019s fine. can i kiss you though? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin stares down at his phone with wide eyes, his cheeks going pink. He takes a minute to respond, which unfortunately inserts an awkward pause into their rapidfire back-and-forth conversation. He hopes Jungkook won\u2019t realize that it\u2019s because he got flustered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:28PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> yes, you should. but keep it chaste. no tongue </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:28PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> that\u2019s no fun :( </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:29PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> my coworkers do not need to see you sticking your tongue down my throat </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:30PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> look, i\u2019m just trying to keep things believable. it\u2019s what i was hired to do </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:31PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i did not hire you. you volunteered </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:31PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> yeah after you literally sprinted across the bar and nearly fell to your knees begging me to come </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:32PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> to the gala. come to the gala </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:32PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> yes? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:33PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i just wanted to clarify because you very much made it sound like something else </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:33PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i guess i should not be surprised you are this filthy </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:34PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> ???? are you flirting with me </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:34PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> haven\u2019t you ever heard of method acting </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:35PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> is seokjin pressuring you into this. does he want you to burst onto the acting scene or something </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:36PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> he is not. i actually haven\u2019t seen him in like two days. he gets home late from shooting and i\u2019ve been busy with work </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:36PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> must not be that busy considering you\u2019ve spent the last 30 minutes texting me </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:37PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i needed a break from CSS. can you really blame me </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:37PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i literally have no idea what that is </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:38PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i\u2019m honestly so jealous\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:38PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> well this little conversation was nice and weird but i am starving and need to order food and get back to my job thank you </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:38PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> ok! don\u2019t forget to send me the info </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:39PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> i\u2019ll send it when i\u2019m done work. also to be completely serious for a moment: thank you, i really appreciate that you are coming with me </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:40PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> don\u2019t worry about it. i\u2019ve never been one to turn down a free meal. plus i\u2019m bulking right now </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:40PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> does that mean trying to get bigger? it didn\u2019t seem to me like you need to do that at all???? </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>boyfriend </b> <b>\ud83d\udc96 </b>2:41PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> oh really? how interesting to know that you feel that way </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>jimin </b>2:42PM</p>\n<p>\n<em> BYE </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin ends up hastily scarfing down his delivery jajangmyeon while simultaneously responding to emails, since he wasted away most of his lunch hour texting Jungkook. But strangely enough, he doesn\u2019t regret it. The conversation left him with a warm glow in his chest. Talking to Jungkook was <em> fun</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything about Jungkook seems fun, actually. Even if the boyfriend part has to stay fake, Jimin wonders if maybe they could be friends after this is all over. It\u2019s been a long time since someone made him smile until his cheeks hurt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u3000 \u0489\u3000\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Saturday arrives, Jimin is less nervous than he anticipated. Namjoon was insistent that he wanted Jimin to be able to kick back and actually enjoy the party, so his day-of responsibilities are basically zero. He had to make sure Namjoon\u2019s notes were prepared for his speech, but that was about it, and he was able to take care of that the day prior.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And surprisingly, Jimin doesn\u2019t feel that strongly about seeing Hyungsik again. Seeing him at the bar seemed to adequately relieve those first-time jitters. He <em> does </em> care about keeping up appearances, though, because he would be horrified if Hyungsik found out he had lied\u2014so he\u2019s grateful that Jungkook will be there with him tonight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin thought he might feel anxious about spending the evening with Jungkook, but it turns out he\u2019s mainly just excited. Jungkook already proved himself to be an excellent date while they were at the bar\u2014and a fabulous actor, to boot. Jimin doesn\u2019t think he has anything to worry about at all.</p>\n<p>The gala is being held at a gorgeous venue on the water\u2014all natural wood and tall ceilings and open air, decked out from top to bottom with lush greenery. The open space has been set up with dozens of tables for everyone to sit and eat dinner, along with multiple bars scattered along the perimeter, and there\u2019s a podium near the front where Namjoon will give his speech and announce the annual employee award winners.</p>\n<p>Jimin shares a cab with Taehyung, who\u2019s attending as Yoongi\u2019s plus one. Having Jungkook come meet them at their apartment seemed like overkill, so Jimin ended up just texting him all the details and asking him to meet them at the venue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they arrive, Jungkook is already waiting in the lobby, off in the corner by himself and staring down at his phone. It takes Jimin a moment to spot him, because he looks like a <em> completely </em> different person than that night they met at the bar. That messy-haired, flannel-clad boy is nowhere to be found. His hair has been tamed and combed back away from his forehead, and he\u2019s in a fitted black suit with the jacket unbuttoned. He\u2019s wearing a white dress shirt underneath and no tie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This outfit does a much better job of revealing his anatomy than the baggy bar ensemble did. The suit is tailored to fit him like a glove, the pants tightly hugging every curve of his muscular thighs, the black leather belt cinching and accenting his deceptively slim waist. Honestly, he looks like he just walked off a cover shoot for some swanky fashion magazine. In other words: he\u2019s scary hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure clean up well,\u201d Jimin says teasingly as he and Taehyung approach. Jungkook looks up from his phone with a small jolt, his eyes wide, then smiles when he sees it\u2019s Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cJumpy,\u201d Taehyung comments. \u201cSuspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gives Taehyung a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Jungkook says, appraising Jimin from head to toe. He leans in slightly, lowering his voice. \u201cHow nice of you to get all dressed up just so that I can take it all off you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung gasps, eyes going round. He looks completely scandalized. Jimin just bursts out laughing, covering his face with his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Was that too far?\u201d Jungkook asks, looking back and forth between them. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have listened to Seokjin\u2019s advice. You know, now that I\u2019m saying it out loud, I\u2019m realizing I really probably shouldn\u2019t have listened to Seokjin\u2019s advice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he give you a script?\u201d Jimin asks, still laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me that he would do the dishes for a whole week if I promised to use the lines he gave me,\u201d Jungkook groans. \u201cI think he just likes feeling important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need his lines,\u201d Jimin says with a shrug. \u201cYou performed perfectly well at the bar with no coaching at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin <em> does </em> look great. That much is true. He\u2019s wearing his favorite suit with a skinny tie and a perfectly shiny pair of boots. His blonde hair is styled in a deep side part with one side swept back. He\u2019s wearing his most expensive cologne and his nicest watch, both of which he reserves for special events only.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Yoongi says, approaching them from the other side of the lobby. He slides an arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist, and Taehyung leans in, kissing him for about two or three seconds longer than is probably appropriate for this hour of the evening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Taehyung pulls back, he gives Jungkook a pointed look. \u201cThat\u2019s how couples usually greet each other, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyungsik isn\u2019t around, though,\u201d Jimin says, glancing around the lobby inconspicuously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis goes beyond him now,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve brought Jungkook here, you\u2019ve got to make sure the whole company believes it. Otherwise, you know someone will tell Hyungsik the second they catch you faking. This office is full of snitches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding in agreement. He steps forward, and before Jimin even really has a chance to get nervous about it, Jungkook places his hand on the small of his back, pulling him in. Their lips brush for a moment, and then Jungkook kisses him. It\u2019s soft and sweet. He tastes like coconut lip balm.</p>\n<p>Jimin is very taken aback.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says, pulling away. He blinks, hand coming up to touch his lips. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Taehyung says cheerfully. \u201cThat was very believable. Jimin, I think you\u2019re blushing. Can you teach me how to blush on command? I think that would come in handy for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am?\u201d Jimin asks, pressing a palm to his right cheek.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up at Jungkook. His eyes are sparkling. But it seems like they are always somewhat sparkly, so this is probably normal.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so easy to fluster,\u201d Jungkook murmurs under his breath with a tiny smile, sliding his hands into his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour job is not to fluster me,\u201d Jimin says flatly. \u201cYour job is to dote on me and make it seem like we are very much in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing flustered is part of being in love,\u201d Yoongi chimes in helpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to expect you to be in love, anyway. Not after you\u2019ve only been together for\u2026 what, a week?\u201d Taehyung asks. \u201cYou\u2019d still be in the infatuation stage at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe still <em> are </em> in the infatuation stage,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cNot <em> would be. </em>My point is that we should stop discussing this out loud. We\u2019re at risk of blowing our cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are so good at this,\u201d Jimin says, reaching out and squeezing his shoulder. It feels like squeezing a rock. \u201cYou are truly the best fake boyfriend I could ask for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that out loud,\u201d Jungkook hisses with wide eyes. \u201cDid you not listen to what I just said?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d Jimin says with a shrug, grabbing his arm and pulling him towards the main entrance to the event space. \u201cLet\u2019s get a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung and Yoongi trail behind them. They walk through a huge archway constructed out of lush, fragrant plants\u2014all real, of course\u2014and then they\u2019re in the main space, already crowded with people, where appetizers are currently being served by waitstaff floating their way around the tables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys go get drinks,\u201d Taehyung says, veering off in the other direction. \u201cOrder me a glass of cabernet, please. I\u2019m going to grab us a table so we don\u2019t end up being forced to sit with weirdos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you not aware that... <em> you </em> are a weirdo?\u201d Yoongi asks. \u201cSurely you must know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t answer. He just waves a hand in the air, his back turned as he weaves his way through the crowd.</p>\n<p>Jimin makes his way towards the closest bar, and Jungkook trails behind him, doing the stereotypical boyfriend-in-a-crowd thing, one hand lightly pressed to his back, steering him gently through the empty spaces between mingling employees. A few people stare at them for a little too long. After all the buzz that his breakup with Hyungsik created, Jimin knows the office busibodies must be thrilled to see him with someone new so soon. And he\u2019s happy to give them something else to talk about.</p>\n<p>After they order their drinks, they crane their necks to find Taehyung, and they eventually spot him all the way on the opposite side of the space. He\u2019s sitting at a table with Hana, a woman from the marketing department who Jimin is somewhat acquainted with, along with her wife.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As fate would have it, while they\u2019re making their way through the crowd, Jimin almost slams directly into Hyungsik, who is walking and talking while looking over his shoulder and not even paying the slightest amount of attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hyungsik stops, and then when he looks down and realizes it\u2019s Jimin he\u2019s nearly collided with, he rolls his eyes. Jimin glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should probably watch where you\u2019re going,\u201d Jungkook says calmly, his jaw ticking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d Hyungsik says, laughing in disbelief. \u201cWow. Can\u2019t say I expected to see you again. Honestly, when Jimin said you were his boyfriend, I wondered if he was lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is not at all drunk enough to handle this situation. He tries to plaster an insulted look on his face and prays he doesn\u2019t look caught out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d Jungkook says, still using that low, unbothered voice. \u201cJust because Jimin is way out of my league doesn\u2019t mean our relationship isn\u2019t legitimate. I\u2019ll have you know that I actually have a number of redeeming qualities, despite my subpar looks. Now if you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hyungsik huffs, shaking his head as Jungkook ushers Jimin past him and guides him in the direction of their table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSubpar looks,\u201d Jimin says dryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompared to you? Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyebrows furrow. \u201cWait. You weren\u2019t kidding? I thought you were just trying to throw him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>They arrive at the table, and Jungkook pulls out Jimin\u2019s chair before sitting down in his own. \u201cI mean, I <em> was </em> trying to throw him off, but I still meant what I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWine!\u201d Taehyung exclaims giddily, making grabby hands at the glass Jimin is holding. Jimin passes it to him, frowning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you need to start drinking,\u201d Yoongi says to Jimin. \u201cAlso, Hana is already two drinks ahead of us. We need to catch up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hana giggles from behind her half-empty wine glass. \u201cI always try to get at least four drinks deep before the speeches start. You know how long-winded Namjoon can be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that better than anyone,\u201d Jimin says, laughing. \u201cHana, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met your wife?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re right,\u201d she says, beaming. She turns to the woman next to her, who\u2019s very pretty\u2014she\u2019s wearing a fitted red dress with matching red lipstick. \u201cThis is Hayoon. She\u2019s a physiotherapist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Jimin tells her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d she says, smiling politely. \u201cDo you work directly with Hana?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d Jimin explains. \u201cI\u2019m the assistant to the CEO. But our paths do cross from time to time. I interface with pretty much every single department during the course of my regular responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Namjoon\u2019s assistant,\u201d Hayoon says, clucking her tongue. \u201cHow is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s honestly pretty fun,\u201d Jimin says, taking a big sip of his wine. He\u2019s got to catch up, especially if he\u2019s going to be forced to engage in the medieval torture that is small talk. \u201cNamjoon\u2019s very easygoing. And my work is different every single day, so it\u2019s never boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin\u2019s job is definitely more exciting than mine,\u201d Hana says, draining the rest of her wine glass. \u201cI spend all day every day herding my employees like they\u2019re chickens escaped from the coop. Now, please <em> do </em> tell me... who\u2019s this handsome young gentleman you\u2019ve brought with you?\u201d she asks, looking over to Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin begins. \u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of a long\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stomps on Jimin\u2019s foot under the table.</p>\n<p>It hurts like a bitch. It takes all of Jimin\u2019s human strength to not immediately release a long string of expletives. He coughs into his wine, wincing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear\u2014are you alright?\u201d Hayoon asks, looking concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust went down the wrong pipe,\u201d Jimin says weakly, clearing his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s message is received loud and clear. Jimin can\u2019t let anyone in on their secret if this is going to work.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Jungkook,\u201d Jimin says with a small sigh.</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles, and a tiny dimple pokes into his left cheek. Jimin hadn\u2019t noticed it before. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Your boyfriend?\u201d Hana asks, blinking. \u201cJimin, I certainly don\u2019t mean to pry, but wasn\u2019t it just a few weeks ago that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHana,\u201d Hayoon says, interrupting her and reaching out to touch her forearm. \u201cI don\u2019t even know exactly what you\u2019re planning on asking, but I can already tell it\u2019s going to be terribly inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hana smiles sheepishly. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, one thing\u2019s confirmed: every damn person employed by this company is an insatiable gossip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jimin says, wishing he could somehow magically summon another glass of wine from the bar. \u201cYes, I was in a relationship with someone else until very recently. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t planning on dating again so soon, but\u2026 life has a funny way of opening doors when you least expect it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is literally the cheesiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Taehyung says, popping a shrimp into his mouth that he\u2019s just snagged from one of the wandering waitstaff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is cheesy,\u201d Jungkook says wistfully. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite things about him, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook literally has no idea whether or not Jimin is actually cheesy, but he delivers the compliment with an impressive amount of conviction.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jimin says, tearing off a small piece of the slice of crusty bread in front of him and feeding it to Jungkook. It\u2019s supposed to seem like a loving gesture, but it ends up looking more like he\u2019s feeding a baby bird.</p>\n<p>Yoongi dissolves into laughter across the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet, Yoongi,\u201d Jimin says with a saccharine smile and a threatening glare. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us about your team\u2019s new project? You know the one, with the\u2014with the thing, and the people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, the people thing,\u201d Taehyung says brightly. \u201cWith the thing and the people! He\u2019s been talking about that one a lot lately. Very thrilling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently sensing that Jimin is trying to shift the topic of conversation away from his relationship status, Yoongi launches into a story about a project that Jimin is 99% sure is completely made up. Jimin nods along enthusiastically like he\u2019s familiar with all the details, and he somehow manages to keep a straight face\u2014even when Yoongi inserts three different acronyms into one sentence, rattling off a comical jumble of letters that Jimin <em> knows </em> doesn\u2019t actually stand for anything at all.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, as the sun slowly sinks below the horizon and the three-course dinner is served, the conversation starts to get a little easier, largely thanks to all the alcohol they\u2019re consuming. The collection of empty bottles and glasses on the table has begun to accumulate into quite the impressive hoard.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all taking turns getting up and ordering rounds of drinks for everyone at the bar, and they even had Yoongi take an extra turn, stashing an extra round of beers at the table, since the bars will be temporarily shut down during Namjoon\u2019s speech and the awards presentation. Jimin feels a deep pang of sympathy for all the employees hired over the past year who are attending the gala for the very first time and are unaware of this fact.</p>\n<p>The dance floor always opens up right after the award presentation is done\u2014and seasoned professionals like Jimin, Yoongi, and Hana are always well-lubricated enough in time to hit it right away. Luckily, it seems like Jungkook can hold his liquor fairly well, and he\u2019s keeping up with them round for round. He\u2019s the perfect drinking companion, dapper and composed. And he\u2019s polite, making well-mannered conversation with everyone at the table throughout the meal. Jimin is starting to wonder if he has <em> any </em> flaws.</p>\n<p>Jimin excuses himself for five minutes to check up on Namjoon and make sure he\u2019s ready for his speech, but everything has gone according to plan and his notes are all in order, so Namjoon shoos him back to his table, telling him to have fun (\u201cbut not <em> too </em> much fun.\u201d) Jimin grabs another drink for himself and Jungkook just before the bar closes, and he slides back into his seat just as Namjoon is taking his place at the podium and a hush is falling over the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome, everyone,\u201d he says, dressed in a black suit, leaning down to speak into the mic, which is slightly too low for him. Jimin makes a mental note to scold the events team about that later. \u201cThank you so much for joining us here tonight. As you know, this celebration is about you. We\u2019re here to honor all your incredible accomplishments over the past year.\u201d He pauses, allowing the audience to applaud for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019d also love to take the opportunity to share a little bit about the direction I see Fila heading in the next year. There are so many amazing things we\u2019re going to do together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe looks young to be the CEO,\u201d Jungkook whispers, leaning in close to Jimin\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Jimin whispers back. \u201cHe\u2019s barely 30.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Jungkook asks, eyebrows furrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis dad was the CEO before,\u201d Jimin explains. \u201cBut he got sick and had to step down. Everyone thought that his brother\u2014Namjoon\u2019s uncle\u2014would be appointed as CEO, but Namjoon\u2019s dad surprised everyone and appointed Namjoon instead. He was working in accounting at the time. It blew everyone away. But he\u2019s been CEO for a couple of years now, and he\u2019s done an amazing job, so he\u2019s earned a lot of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods, not saying anything else, turning his focus back to Namjoon\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p>It goes by rather quickly, at least compared to prior years. He touches on some of Fila\u2019s greatest achievements over the past 12 months, thanks a few departments in particular for all their hard work, and then he talks a little bit about his vision for what Fila will accomplish over the next year. If Jimin was sober, it would probably feel longer, but he\u2019s buzzed enough to feel warm and giddy and content right where he is.</p>\n<p>Plus, he keeps stealing glances at Jungkook, which is fun. Why is it fun? He doesn\u2019t know, nor does he plan on trying to figure it out. It just <em> is</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no break between Namjoon\u2019s speech and the awards ceremony\u2014after a long moment where everyone gives him a round of applause, rising to their feet, he pulls out a new stack of notecards and straightens the edges, knocking them against the podium. Jimin hasn\u2019t seen these notes. The award winners are kept confidential from pretty much everyone until they\u2019re announced.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you know, these annual awards are meant to recognize the best of the best here at Fila. The employees who have worked relentlessly over the past year, going above and beyond to leave a legacy behind them. To those of you who are about to receive this award tonight: your work hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed, and I hope this will help demonstrate our deep appreciation for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The audience applauds, tittering nervously. Jungkook leans over to Jimin, whispering: \u201cAre these awards a big deal or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cGetting one is pretty much the highest honor you can receive here. Plus, everyone who wins goes on a trip,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cApparently it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll win,\u201d Jungkook says matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve worked here long enough. Usually it\u2019s people who have been around for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi dramatically shushes them from across the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs many of you already know, everyone who\u2019s honored tonight will be awarded with an all-expenses-paid trip next month. This year, we\u2019ll be spending four days at a resort on Jeju Island.\u201d The crowd <em> oohs </em> and <em> aahs</em>, and Namjoon smiles. \u201cAfter last year\u2019s experience on the mountaintop, we decided to go with something a little more traditional this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently people with a fear of heights didn\u2019t fare so well when they showed up and realized the accommodations were perched right on the edge of a mountain,\u201d Jimin whispers to Jungkook. \u201cSome people went home early because they were too worried about plunging to their deaths.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUngrateful,\u201d Jungkook whispers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jimin whispers back, laughing quietly.</p>\n<p>The awards presentation begins. Namjoon gives a brief introduction for each person, submitted by whoever nominated them for the award, then the winner walks up to the podium to collect their engraved glass trophy, which is an intricate sculpture of the Fila logo.</p>\n<p>There are usually about 20 winners, and Namjoon makes quick work of running through the list. There\u2019s a woman from HR, someone from the marketing department who\u2019s relatively new, a man from the product design team, a seasoned member of the PR department, and one of the custodial staff. They\u2019re all absolutely delighted to receive the award, smiling wide and bowing and practically bouncing back to their seats, and it\u2019s heartwarming to see them all so happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is my personal honor to be presenting this next award, which is also the last award of the evening,\u201d Namjoon says at the podium. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to work side-by-side with this person for over two years now. His work ethic is second to none and he\u2019s an absolute joy to be around. His warmth and positive attitude is contagious. And he puts up with <em> me </em> every day\u2014that alone makes him deserving of an award, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd laughs politely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth falls open a little.</p>\n<p>Namjoon meets Jimin\u2019s eye in the crowd and smiles. \u201cPlease congratulate Park Jimin, my assistant, for winning this year\u2019s Fila Excellence award.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook bursts into applause next to him, beaming like he\u2019s known Jimin for years. It\u2019s very convincing. Jimin rises to his feet in shock, weaving his way through the tables as he makes his way up to the podium. He really was not expecting this at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Namjoon says to Jimin, stepping away from the mic and handing him the trophy. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Jimin says, bowing. He laughs incredulously. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon slaps him on the back gently. \u201cYou should. You\u2019re more deserving than anyone. Now go celebrate. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin bows again, then returns to his table with the award, smiling politely at the people at other tables whispering their congratulations to him on his way back.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, you motherfucker,\u201d Yoongi says as Jimin is sitting down. For Yoongi, this is a term of endearment. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to bust my ass for the next ten years before I\u2019m ever considered for one of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think working for Namjoon probably gave me a slight advantage,\u201d Jimin says sheepishly, touching his hair to make sure the swept-back style is still holding.</p>\n<p>\u201cFalse,\u201d Taehyung declares. \u201cYou deserve every award in existence. If it were up to me, you would have a Nobel Peace Prize by now, a Pulitzer Prize, the Order of Cultural Merit\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat has he done to deserve any of those, exactly?\u201d Yoongi asks, one eyebrow raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone loves him,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI love him. His parents love him. Animals love him. Jungkook loves him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook chokes on his beer a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you have to do a bit more than be widely loved to win a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Yoongi says to Taehyung. He says it kindly and with sympathy, like it\u2019s understandable that Taehyung doesn\u2019t actually know this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should be congratulating Jungkook, too,\u201d Hana says from across the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook blinks. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>It dawns on Jimin, then, what she\u2019s going to say. What he hadn\u2019t thought about until now. He has to fight the urge to clutch his head in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the award winners are allowed to bring a plus one for the trip!\u201d Hana says, glancing over at her wife. \u201cHayoon has been harassing me for years because I haven\u2019t won yet. She really wants a free vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just think it would be nice,\u201d Hayoon says, pouting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, I guess you\u2019re going to Jeju!\u201d Hana says to Jungkook, smiling brightly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks like he\u2019s struggling not to laugh. He leans back in his chair, the corner of his mouth twitching up in a smile. \u201cWow. Cool. I guess so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Jimin insists, turning towards him. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re too busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I be too busy to go on vacation with my boyfriend?\u201d Jungkook asks, tilting his head. His eyes are twinkling. \u201cI can clear my schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says weakly. \u201cBut you don\u2019t even know when it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Jungkook says with a shrug.</p>\n<p>Jimin glances at Taehyung across the table. He looks like he\u2019s about to lose it\u2014his shoulders are shaking and he\u2019s covered his face with his hand. Jimin shoots a look at Yoongi, and Yoongi swats at Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Taehyung straightens up, pulling his hand away, revealing watery eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you two will have a wonderful time,\u201d Taehyung chokes out, clearly one second away from bursting into hysterical laughter. He wipes at his eyes. \u201cSorry. I just got a little emotional because I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>After presenting Jimin\u2019s award, Namjoon had stepped away from the podium for a few minutes to take photos with any of the award winners who wanted a picture with him. Now, he returns to the mic, tapping on it a couple of times to get everyone\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve all been waiting for this moment,\u201d Namjoon says, smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started, shall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd erupts into cheers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you all have a fantastic night. Have fun, be safe, and thank you again for all your hard work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon steps down from the podium, and the lights are dimmed a few seconds later. Party lights begin to flash above the large, open space in the center of the venue, and the DJ in the corner leans into his own mic as the music starts to play. \u201cI want to see everyone out on the dance floor right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone immediately flocks to the dance floor. Hana leaps up and practically drags Hayoon away from the table. Taehyung rises to his feet, and Yoongi follows. Jungkook starts to get up, but Jimin touches his arm, stalling him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you guys coming?\u201d Taehyung asks, pausing.</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a few minutes. We\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you unwell?\u201d Taehyung says, putting the back of his hand to Jimin\u2019s forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jimin says, smiling and swatting him away. \u201cGo. Have fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi takes Taehyung\u2019s hand and leads him out to the dance floor. Jungkook turns to Jimin, scooting his chair a bit closer to him. Jimin is not sure why he does that. It makes him feel slightly flustered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m in trouble?\u201d Jungkook says quietly. He\u2019s smiling, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI just figured we should talk about the trip before we get too wrapped up in our\u2014well, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur scam?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes it sound so unpleasant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. It\u2019s not unpleasant,\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2014well, no. I guess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook reaches out and rests his hand on Jimin\u2019s knee. He squeezes it a little. It\u2019s very distracting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you to explain something to me. Why don\u2019t you have a boyfriend?\u201d Jimin demands, keeping his voice low.</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s suspicious that you don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cIt\u2019s very weird to me that you\u2019re single. With your\u2026 you know. All of you, and all of your\u2026 anyway. I want to know why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should probably take this as a compliment, I guess?\u201d Jungkook asks, scratching his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how you take it. I just want to make sure you\u2019re not an axe murderer or something before I bring you along with me to Jeju and let you sleep in the same room as me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin. If I was an axe murderer, do you think I would <em> tell </em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Jimin grumbles.</p>\n<p>Jungkook squeezes Jimin\u2019s knee again. He leans back in his chair, sighing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just picky,\u201d Jungkook says quietly, looking straight ahead. \u201cWell, maybe picky isn\u2019t the right word. I\u2019m\u2026 particular. I\u2019m too intense for a lot of people. I\u2019m big into romance and I believe in soulmates and I feel all of my feelings really strongly. It usually scares everyone away. After a while, I kind of stopped trying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says, blinking. That is not the answer he was expecting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cIt sounds like you just haven\u2019t found the right person yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t kill people. And you\u2019re not in the witness protection program. You\u2019re just\u2026 cheesy? You tell people you love them three days after you\u2019ve started dating? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think my record was five days,\u201d Jungkook says wistfully. \u201cBut I really thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Jimin says, brushing him off. \u201cI don\u2019t think these are flaws. They\u2019re just\u2026 quirks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now, about the trip\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on. Hyungsik is staring at you,\u201d Jungkook says, gazing somewhere past Jimin\u2019s shoulder, towards the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Do something boyfriend-y, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to look? To double check whether I\u2019m telling the truth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares at him. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I could be lying. I could just be making up an excuse to kiss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cheeks flush. \u201cWhy would you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook bursts into laughter, cutting him off. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so fun when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m drunk?\u201d Jimin huffs, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. All the time, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop fucking with me. No one is around to overhear us and your flirting is extremely confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying. He\u2019s looking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs, closing his eyes. \u201cDo something, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans in close, pressing a kiss to Jimin\u2019s temple. With his eyes closed, Jimin doesn\u2019t see him approach, so he doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s going to do until it happens\u2014until he feels the warm brush of Jungkook\u2019s lips against his skin, his breath on his cheek. He lingers there for a moment, not pulling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are very good at this, you know,\u201d Jimin murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you should reward me with an all-expenses paid trip to Jeju,\u201d Jungkook whispers in his ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls back, frowning. \u201cYou seriously want to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do. Don\u2019t you think I deserve some compensation for all the hard work I\u2019ve been putting into this relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no relationship,\u201d Jimin reminds him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pushes a finger to Jimin\u2019s lips, shushing him. Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that here,\u201d Jungkook says, scolding.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we need to talk about this,\u201d Jimin hisses. \u201cHyungsik isn\u2019t even <em> going </em> on the trip. Is it really necessary to keep up the charade, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard what Yoongi said earlier. Everyone at the company has to buy it\u2014otherwise he\u2019ll find out. So, yes, it would be weird if I\u2019m supposedly your boyfriend and I don\u2019t come with you. I mean, unless you want to tell everyone we broke up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thought of doing that sends a weird and unpleasant pang right through the center of Jimin\u2019s chest that he doesn\u2019t understand at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen take me with you,\u201d Jungkook says, shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to come so badly? I don\u2019t get why you want to keep helping me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about helping you. It\u2019s been, like, two years since I went on a proper vacation. I don\u2019t get much time off at work. And this one would be free\u2026 so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. \u201cFine. You can come. But I\u2019m specifically requesting a room with two beds. No funny business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook puts both hands up. \u201cNo funny business, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Jimin drains the last of his beer, the music fades out to something quieter, and the DJ leans into the mic again. \u201cThis one\u2019s for all the couples out there. Let\u2019s slow things down a little! Now\u2019s the time to grab your lover and come on out to the dance floor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He presses a few buttons, and then a slow ballad starts playing. Jimin vaguely recognizes it\u2014maybe from a drama he watched a long time ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook reaches out, still seated, placing both hands on Jimin\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGrabbing my lover,\u201d Jungkook says solemnly.</p>\n<p>Jimin dissolves into laughter, sliding out of Jungkook\u2019s grip. \u201cYou are so ridiculous. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin leads him out to the dance floor, and they settle into an empty space near the edge as the song reaches the first chorus. Jungkook steps in close and places his hand on the small of Jimin\u2019s back. He takes Jimin\u2019s other hand in his own, then starts to lead them around in a slow, lazy circle, humming a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I slow danced like this,\u201d Jimin admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyungsik not much of a slow dancer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly the romantic type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gathered that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were together for a few months, but it was a lot less serious than you\u2019d expect a relationship to be after you\u2019d been together for that long,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI mean, like, we rarely went on dates at all, and when I saw him, it was usually just to fuck. He intentionally kept things very casual. And I didn\u2019t mind, I think because I was just\u2026 lonely? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve much better than that,\u201d Jungkook murmurs quietly.</p>\n<p>Jimin already knows that\u2019s true, but for some reason, hearing Jungkook say it feels terribly validating. It makes his chest tighten in a way he\u2019s not expecting.</p>\n<p>And Jimin knows it\u2019s emotionally irresponsible, but it\u2019s easy to let his mind wander when he\u2019s pressed this close to Jungkook. When his hand is gently enveloped by Jungkook\u2019s larger one. When Jungkook is humming so softly in his ear, like it\u2019s a song only meant for him to hear, it\u2019s easy\u2014so easy that Jimin allows himself to think for one fleeting moment: <em> What would it be like to be loved by him? </em></p>\n<p>It would feel like the warmth of the sun, Jimin thinks. If he was ready to feel the warmth of the sun. Which he\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>Clearly he\u2019s had too much to drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jungkook asks, breaking the moment of silence that had stretched between them during Jimin\u2019s reckless thought experiment. They\u2019re still continuing their slow, easy sway, guided by Jungkook\u2019s steady hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Jimin says seriously.</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you so easy to get along with?\u201d Jimin asks, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m waiting to discover a flaw. Tell me one, actually. I would like to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I already told you earlier that I\u2019m a disaster in relationships. I think that\u2019s probably a flaw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me another one, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook pauses for a moment, his eyebrow creasing in thought. That damn dimple pokes into his cheek again as he ponders. Jimin wonders why everything he does has to be so fucking cute. It\u2019s starting to become relatively distressing.</p>\n<p>In the background, the song is nearing its end, and the DJ gradually transitions this ballad into another slow one. \u201cHere\u2019s one more for all you lovebirds before we get the party started back up again,\u201d he says into the mic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too clean,\u201d Jungkook finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re too clean,\u201d Jimin parrots, his voice flat.</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods, his hand sliding up Jimin\u2019s back a little. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re claiming this is a flaw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is! It drives Seokjin crazy. I have to organize everything in my own particular way, and I have a special way of folding all my clothes, and if anything is out of place, it drives me nuts. I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s very annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, coming from someone who lives with Taehyung\u2014Kim Taehyung, you know, the one right over there, who thinks underwear strewn all over the floor counts as home decor and makes his room look <em> lived in </em>\u2014I think that actually sounds quite ideal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do strike me as someone who would be tidy,\u201d Jungkook says, pulling Jimin a tiny bit closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah? Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the energy you give off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you strike me as someone who is suspiciously perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have now told you about <em> two </em> of my flaws. How can I be perfect if I have two flaws?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so flawed,\u201d Jimin says in a sing-song voice. \u201cI\u2019m way too romantic and I love doing laundry. Who could ever love me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook frowns a little. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me. People really have been bothered by those things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin says, and he is. He can\u2019t help it\u2014he reaches up, tucking a lock of hair behind Jungkook\u2019s ear. \u201cI think those people must have been pretty silly. You seem great just how you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re playing the role of fake boyfriend impressively well right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing anything,\u201d Jimin says, shaking his head. \u201cI meant what I just said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jungkook says, his face softening. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s best at faking, anyway, not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to be the best at everything I do,\u201d Jungkook says seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, eyes roaming over the rest of the dance floor. He spots Yoongi and Taehyung swaying together prom-style, Yoongi\u2019s arms looped around Taehyung\u2019s neck. Several feet behind them, Hyungsik is slow-dancing with his date, who appears to be the same guy he\u2019d brought to the bar last weekend. Surprisingly, the sight doesn\u2019t make Jimin feel much of anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, even though we ran into him, I\u2019ve barely thought about Hyungsik tonight,\u201d Jimin murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ve just been having a good time with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to be thought about, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt this point, all I really care about is making sure he doesn\u2019t find out that I lied about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it sounds like our ruse is still underway,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cCan he see you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cHe\u2019s over by Yoongi and Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder again, then glances back just in time to feel the firm press of Jungkook\u2019s mouth to his.</p>\n<p>Jimin makes a little noise in surprise, closing his eyes, and he can feel Jungkook smile against his lips, releasing his hand so that he can reach up and gently cup the back of Jimin\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember what I said,\u201d Jimin says, murmuring against his mouth. \u201cNo tongue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Jungkook says, kissing him softly again. \u201cI have a very good memory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything about you is very good, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when you said I was being confusing and flirting with you too much,\u201d Jungkook says, kissing along Jimin\u2019s jaw, just below his ear. \u201cIt kind of feels like you are the one doing that now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cYou\u2019re the one kissing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kissed me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans in one more time and kisses him again, his fingertips tracing across Jimin\u2019s back. Jimin tilts his head back a little, lips soft and open against Jungkook\u2019s mouth. The ballad is ending now, quickly transitioning to something more upbeat, and the people who had only come out for the slow songs start to trickle off the dance floor.</p>\n<p>Neither one of them make any move to leave. They\u2019re too busy kissing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re making a scene,\u201d Jungkook says after a moment, pulling away and brushing quickly across Jimin\u2019s bottom lip with his thumb. Jimin blinks up at him in a daze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jimin agrees after a moment, letting out a shaky breath and taking a small step backwards. \u201cDo you wanna go sit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jungkook says softly.</p>\n<p>So they head back to their table, and for the rest of the night, they just sit there and talk, both of them nursing one final drink. In previous years, Jimin has always spent this part of the evening going wild on the dance floor, letting loose all of the work-related stress he\u2019d accumulated over the course of the year prior, but tonight, that doesn\u2019t appeal to him as much as this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of their table companions spend the night dancing, so they\u2019re alone at the table. They talk for a long time, and in their semi-drunken state, the rest of the night rushes past them surprisingly quickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook explains more about his work\u2014which up until now, had felt like a mystery to Jimin, considering he knows nothing at all about web development. They talk about their families and realize that they both grew up in Busan. Jimin tells the story of how he was able to land the job working for Namjoon. He tells Jungkook more about Taehyung, gushing about how he is Jimin\u2019s favorite person in the world, despite all of his idiosyncrasies. Or maybe <em> because </em> of them.</p>\n<p>Talking to Jungkook is easy. And Jimin thinks the reason it\u2019s so easy, mainly, is because Jungkook actually listens to him. It seems like he genuinely cares what Jimin has to say. He listens intently. He asks questions. He laughs whenever Jimin is trying to be funny. Although there\u2019s no way to be completely certain, Jimin is pretty sure he isn\u2019t faking any of that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Jimin met someone who actually seemed to care about him so much.</p>\n<p>What makes this all terribly confusing is that Jimin has now also spent a considerable amount of time kissing Jungkook, and touching Jungkook, and thinking about how hot and cute and kind he is, and then he has to immediately remind himself that every bit of this is fake. Which, incidentally, is getting a little bit harder to do.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s entirely possible that Jeju is going to be a disaster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it seems like Jungkook really wants to come, and secretly\u2014although he gave Jungkook a hard time about it\u2014Jimin really wants him to come, too.</p>\n<p>So although it seems slightly ill-advised, Jimin agrees to text Jungkook all the details about the trip once he learns more about it next week. Jimin also leans his head on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder when the end of the evening draws near and he\u2019s starting to get a little sleepy. He reassures himself that this is all just part of the scheme. If his fake boyfriend has a shoulder, he may as well take advantage of said shoulder.</p>\n<p>Eventually, groups of people start to head home, and Taehyung and Yoongi return to the table, looking thoroughly exhausted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting a boyfriend made you boring,\u201d Taehyung whines, crossing his arms and pouting. \u201cYou didn\u2019t dance with us at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make Jungkook feel bad,\u201d Jimin scolds him. \u201cHe\u2019s only doing his job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis situation is still incredibly confusing to me, but I feel like it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t ask questions,\u201d Yoongi says with a sigh, buttoning his suit jacket.</p>\n<p>After gathering their belongings and nearly forgetting Jimin\u2019s trophy, they all walk out of the venue together, and since Jimin and Taehyung are sharing a cab home, Jimin has to bid Jungkook farewell once they get outside.</p>\n<p>He looks different out here, under the starlight, hair falling into his eyes. It makes it even easier to pretend that all this actually means something.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet home safe,\u201d Jungkook tells him, slipping his hands into his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jimin says, shuffling his feet nervously. \u201cYou too, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. \u201cI had a lot of fun tonight. Thank you for inviting me,\u201d he says earnestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had fun too. I should be thanking you, really. Thank you for coming with me. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles softly. \u201cI wanted to. Do you want a regular goodbye, or a boyfriend goodbye?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA boyfriend goodbye, probably.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans down, lips brushing across Jimin\u2019s mouth in a kiss so gentle that Jimin wonders if the whole thing was a figment of his imagination. Then he kisses Jimin\u2019s nose, and then his forehead, pulling away a moment later, starting to walk backwards in the other direction, hands still in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in Jeju, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, trying to calm his pounding heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in Jeju.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0\u0489 \u3000\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou better hurry up. You\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Taehyung calls from the bathroom, voice garbled as he brushes his teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin glances up from where he\u2019s wrestling with his tiny carry-on suitcase on the bed, his body flung halfway on top of it, trying to squish it down enough that he\u2019ll be able to zip it closed. \u201cWho are <em>you</em> to lecture <em>me</em> about being late? You\u2019ve never been on time for anything in your life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI think I was on time for a doctor\u2019s appointment once,\u201d he says. Jimin hears him spit his toothpaste into the sink. \u201cSeriously, though, I\u2019m just trying to help. Didn\u2019t you say you needed to leave by 10:30?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin grabs his phone, tapping the screen. It\u2019s 10:35.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s later than I thought,\u201d Jimin says, zipping up his suitcase with a final grunt and hauling it off the bed. It hits the ground with a loud thud. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I gotta go.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDo you have everything you need?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI think so.\u201d Jimin wheels his suitcase out of his bedroom and down the hall. Taehyung follows him, still wearing his pajamas from the night before.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDeodorant? Sunscreen? Sunglasses?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes to all of the above,\u201d Jimin says, grabbing the backpack he\u2019d packed and left by the door last night. He\u2019s in a summery outfit that\u2019ll also be comfortable for travel by plane: a breezy white short-sleeved button-down with navy cutoff shorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat about condoms?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin stops in his tracks, leveling what he hopes is a very threatening glare in Taehyung\u2019s direction. \u201cI do <em>not</em> need to bring condoms.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t, because I already put some in your suitcase!\u201d Taehyung says, smiling brightly, walking over and slapping the suitcase twice. \u201cYou can never be too prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDammit, Taehyung,\u201d Jimin whines, running two hands through his hair. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t put anything else in there?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust lube,\u201d he says noncommittally, rounding the kitchen island and opening the fridge. He pulls out a container of orange juice, taking a swig right from the bottle. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s travel size, so it\u2019s fine to have in your carry-on!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Jimin says flatly. \u201cTruly don\u2019t know what I would do without you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow nice of you to finally show me a little appreciation,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI thought about putting your handcuffs in there too, but I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Jimin announces, scowling, hauling his backpack over one shoulder and putting on his sunglasses. He reaches for the doorknob. \u201cAnd by the way, I know about your bet with Yoongi. I know that\u2019s why you put that stuff in my suitcase. You\u2019re just trying to win.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taehyung gasps. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah, well, he really wants to win. I don\u2019t know what you wagered, but please <em>don\u2019t</em> tell me, because I don\u2019t want to know. If he\u2019s that passionate about it, I know it\u2019s got to be something freaky and inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Taehyung says, pouting. \u201cBut a bet was irresistible! He\u2019s so sure you won\u2019t cave! He\u2019s so naive. He\u2019s <em>seen</em> Jungkook, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s not clicking for him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust because Jungkook is hot doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to sleep with him. You know I don\u2019t do one night stands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be a one night stand, though.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin blinks. \u201cYou think we\u2019re going to get together, then? Like, as a <em>couple</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m just saying it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world,\u201d Taehyung says, holding up his hands. \u201cWait, so you admit that he\u2019s hot?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhen have I ever denied that he\u2019s hot?\u201d Jimin says, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh, I\u2019ve totally got this in the bag,\u201d Taehyung says, smiling happily to himself and pulling out his phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to text Yoongi right now and tell him my new safe word so that he can plan ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGoodbye, Taehyung,\u201d Jimin says dully, opening the door and wheeling his suitcase through. \u201cYou are the light of my life, but you deeply exhaust me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBye! Love you!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door swings shut behind Jimin, and he heads briskly down the hall towards the elevator, checking the time on his phone again. He had planned to take the subway for the first leg of the journey to the airport, but since he\u2019s running late, it\u2019s probably going to be better to take a cab the whole way there.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just before he\u2019s about to slide his phone back in his pocket, it buzzes and lights up in his hand. He glances down at the screen.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>boyfriend </b><span class=\"s1\">\ud83d\udc96</span><b> </b>10:45AM</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>just got to the airport :) are you here?</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin hastily types a reply with one hand as the elevator dings and reaches the ground floor.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>jimin</b><b> </b>10:46AM</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>sorry i\u2019m running late :( just leaving my apartment now, taking a cab so i\u2019ll be there as soon as i can</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>boyfriend </b><span class=\"s1\">\ud83d\udc96</span><b> </b>10:46AM</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>oh sure you are</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>boyfriend </b><span class=\"s1\">\ud83d\udc96</span><b> </b>10:47AM</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>have i fallen victim to an elaborate scheme to ship me off to jeju alone so you won\u2019t have to deal with me anymore</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>jimin</b><b> </b>10:47AM</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>if i was going to do that, trust me, i would ship you off to somewhere much further away</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin shakes his head and smiles, slipping his phone back into his shorts and climbing into the cab idling at the curb in front of his apartment building.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGimpo Airport,\u201d he tells the cab driver, and the driver nods and merges back into traffic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin is oddly excited to see Jungkook. The gala was about a month ago, and they haven\u2019t seen each other since then, since there wasn\u2019t really a reason for them to. Jimin hasn\u2019t had any other work functions or social gatherings where Jungkook was required to step in and play the role of handsome, doting boyfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it would be awkward if they completely stopped talking for an entire month, then suddenly went on a trip together, so to prevent that, they\u2019ve kept in touch, texting from time to time. Not every day like <em>real</em> boyfriends would, but enough that Jimin feels like he\u2019s been able to get to know Jungkook a little better and will feel slightly less out of his depth when he\u2019s thrust into spending four straight days with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook feels less like a stranger now and more like a friend. He\u2019s shared more about himself with Jimin\u2014including his hobbies, which apparently consist of going to the gym, playing video games, and trying to learn how to play the piano. Before Jimin could begin irrationally swooning over that, Jungkook informed him he\u2019s currently about as skilled as a five-year-old who\u2019s just starting to learn.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which was good, because Jimin does not need any more reasons to swoon. He needs less reasons to swoon, actually.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now that a bit more time has passed since Jimin\u2019s breakup with Hyungsik, he\u2019s allowed himself to wonder occasionally, fleetingly, usually when he\u2019s lying in bed and having trouble sleeping: what are these weird feelings that swirl in the pit of his stomach when he thinks about Jungkook?\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Why has Jungkook agreed to this arrangement for so long?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And the most terrifying question of all: is there any chance that everything <em>hasn\u2019t </em>been completely and totally fake?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During those two nights he spent with Jungkook, Jimin had worked hard to convince himself that everything he felt was just pretend. But as the angry haze of his post-breakup man-hatred has started to lift, he\u2019s starting to question whether that\u2019s actually true.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because when he thinks about Jungkook\u2026 when he thinks about how it feels to have Jungkook\u2019s hands all over his body, about the way Jungkook kisses him so easy and slow, about the way Jungkook throws his head back when he laughs\u2026 Jimin can feel a familiar warmth spreading through his chest. Sometimes, he even blushes. That isn\u2019t exactly something he can fake.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Jimin isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s ready to put himself out there again, especially since he\u2019s not sure that Jungkook feels the same way. Jungkook has dropped tiny hints that he isn\u2019t interested in dating anyone, especially early on. He\u2019d made offhand comments at the bar, and at the gala, he\u2019d said that he was too picky and particular. Jimin can\u2019t imagine that <em>he</em> would be the choice pick for someone who\u2019s admittedly picky. So maybe Jungkook is just pretending, after all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If he\u2019s being totally honest with himself, then Jimin can admit he has a tiny crush. That\u2019s it, though. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, and it doesn\u2019t mean he has to do anything about it. It <em>certainly</em> doesn\u2019t mean anything is going to come out of it. After this trip, as much as Jimin hates to think about it, it\u2019s likely that his arrangement with Jungkook will be over.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So he\u2019s decided to simply enjoy the trip for exactly what it is: four days with someone cute and fun who makes him laugh, and maybe they\u2019ll even get to kiss a little, if somebody happens to be looking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Traffic is terrible, and it takes longer than Jimin was expecting to get to the airport, but when they pull up to the departures terminal, there\u2019s still a little over an hour until his flight is scheduled to board, so Jimin figures that should be plenty of time. He pays the cab driver, thanking him before grabbing his suitcase and wheeling it through the automated revolving doors leading into the airport.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He looks both directions, then sees a sign for Jeju Air with an arrow pointing to the left, so he heads in that direction, down towards the check-in counters that are visible in the distance. Once he gets closer, he spots Jungkook\u2014he\u2019s sitting on a row of airport chairs across from the counters, wearing a pair of fitted shorts and a patterned blue short-sleeve button-down. His hair is loose and wavy, a pair of sunglasses is perched on top of his head, and he\u2019s scrolling through his phone, his foot tapping.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0\u201cHey, you,\u201d Jimin calls out once he gets within ten feet of him. \u201cI decided not to ship you off to Jeju alone after all.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook glances up, and when he sees Jimin, a bright smile quickly takes over his entire face, his nose scrunching.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t know what to make of the way his stomach swoops nervously at the sight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear that,\u201d Jungkook says, rising to his feet and slipping his phone into his shirt pocket. He steps forward\u2014three long, quick strides\u2014and then he\u2019s wrapping Jimin in a tight hug, pressing him to his chest, surrounding him in that comforting fresh-laundry scent that Jimin had been wondering when he\u2019d get to smell again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHi. How was the drive?\u201d Jungkook asks, releasing him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin gets a good look at him now that they\u2019re up close. He has a little bit of a glow about him, like he\u2019s been spending some time in the sun this summer. \u201cIt was fine. Traffic was bad, so I was worried about being late. I\u2019m gonna check in. You already did?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cShouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin turns around to look at the check-in counter and is relieved to see there\u2019s hardly a line. \u201cOkay, wait here? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After waiting in the short queue, the process of checking in is ultimately quick and easy, and once he shows his passport and gets his boarding pass, Jimin heads back over to where Jungkook is sitting. He doesn\u2019t have a suitcase with him\u2014only a large black backpack.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat\u2019s all you brought?\u201d Jimin asks. \u201cHow\u2019d you fit all your clothes in there?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook slings the backpack over his shoulder easily, trailing behind Jimin as they walk towards the security check on the opposite side of the terminal. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t pack that many. I assumed I wouldn\u2019t need very many clothes for this trip.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPerfect,\u201d Jimin says flatly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat? We\u2019re going to the beach!\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably just be in swim trunks most of the time, right? I packed a couple of real outfits for dinner and stuff, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For some reason, Jimin hadn\u2019t really considered until now just how little clothing would be required during their time together. He hadn\u2019t thought about all the time they\u2019d spend at the beach or pool. It\u2019s probably better that he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGuess I\u2019ll finally get to see all those tattoos of yours, huh?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMost of them,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin stares at him, his eyes narrowing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The right side of Jungkook\u2019s mouth curls into a crooked smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNothing,\u201d Jimin huffs, hauling his suitcase onto the conveyor belt to go through the scanner.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook falls into line behind him, laughing quietly and plopping his backpack down behind Jimin\u2019s bag. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get to see the rest of yours, then, too.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou already could, if only you were more observant.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook\u2019s head pops up in interest. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Suddenly there are two strong hands on Jimin\u2019s shoulders from behind, basically manhandling him, tilting his body from side to side. Jungkook leans left to right, turning his head, trying to check Jimin from every angle.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin dissolves into laughter. \u201cStop. You\u2019re making a scene.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh!\u201d Jungkook says, fingertips pushing Jimin\u2019s shirt sleeve up a little bit, exposing the back of his arm. He runs a finger across the tattoo there, and goosebumps rise across Jimin\u2019s skin. \u201cYou have one here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin nods, swallowing audibly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Jungkook checks the other arm, giving it the same treatment. \u201cOne here.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>No?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo,\u201d Jimin confirms, unable to fight back a laugh.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook starts to spin him around, but Jimin wiggles out of his hold, smiling and shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the other one eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs that a promise? Or a threat?\u201d Jungkook asks, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re doing the confusingly flirty thing again.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook\u2019s face softens. \u201cI just like tattoos.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course that\u2019s all it is. Jimin sighs. He can sense that his cheeks have gone a little pink.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He steps forward to go through the body scanner, and Jungkook follows once he\u2019s done. It doesn\u2019t take long, and after making a stop at one of the overpriced airport convenience stores to grab bottled water and a couple of snacks in case they get hungry on the plane, they arrive at their gate, which isn\u2019t very crowded yet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs everyone from Fila coming on the same flight?\u201d Jungkook asks, looking around at all the empty chairs. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly anyone here.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin shakes his head. \u201cThere are lots of flights to Jeju each day, so they let us each book our own. That way we could make sure the timing worked with our own schedules. There\u2019s no itinerary for today, since everyone is arriving at different times, so we\u2019ll just be able to do whatever we want once we get there. Tomorrow, though, there are some workshops during the day that I have to go to.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThey\u2019re making you go to workshops while you\u2019re on vacation?\u201d Jungkook asks, eyebrows furrowing. \u201cHow rude.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust during that one day. Don\u2019t be so offended. After all, it means you\u2019ll get to escape my clutches and actually have some time to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook does not look as happy about that as Jimin would have anticipated.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThere are a couple of people I recognize here, though,\u201d Jimin says, nodding towards the wall near the gate. \u201cThe lady in the pink dress is one of the other award winners. She works in HR.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI guess my role resumes now, then,\u201d Jungkook says. He reaches out, taking Jimin\u2019s hand in his own. He laces their fingers together. \u201cBoyfriend mode officially activated.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin squeezes his hand, glancing up at him and smiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He does not know how he is going to survive four whole days of this.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"s3\">\u3000</span> \u0489<span class=\"s3\">\u3000</span>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The flight is quick\u2014only about an hour long\u2014and they don\u2019t talk much, although it\u2019s not awkward. Jimin takes care of a few last minute things he needed to wrap up for Namjoon before the trip, working on files he\u2019d saved to his phone so they\u2019d be accessible offline, and Jungkook puts headphones in and plays a game on his phone. When they touch down in Jeju, there\u2019s hardly a cloud in the sky, and the sun feels brighter somehow, like the whole world is a little more saturated. They fly in low over the water, deep blue and sparkling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The resort they\u2019re staying at is called The Shilla, and since it\u2019s all the way on the other side of the island, it has a dedicated shuttle that runs hourly from the airport. They follow the signs out of the airport towards the public transportation hub and wait for the next one to come. The ride is comfortable and goes by fast, too. It\u2019s a large bus with soft, cushioned seats and powerful air conditioning, which offers them a welcome relief from the burning hot sun. Jungkook idly drums his fingers against Jimin\u2019s knee the whole way there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The resort is scenic and sprawling, and they get a great view of the ocean as the bus climbs the mountainous hill the resort is perched on top of. The resort itself isn\u2019t directly on the beach, but it\u2019s walkable, with a winding path and long set of stairs leading down to the ocean. Because the building was constructed on the highest point of the hill, there\u2019s nothing to block the view of the water, so all the rooms facing that direction have an ocean view. Jimin is hoping their room will be on that side, although they won\u2019t know for sure until they check in.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d Jungkook murmurs as they walk together into the lobby, a gigantic open-air space with huge ceiling fans, everything painted in earthy tones of cream and tan and brown. Lots of large plants\u2014real ones, Jimin observes, as he\u2019s been trained to do\u2014decorate the space tastefully. It\u2019s giving very expensive vibes. Jimin is quite thankful he isn\u2019t paying for a cent of this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHello, gentlemen,\u201d the woman behind the counter in the lobby greets them. \u201cChecking in?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin says, pulling out his wallet and fishing out his ID. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the Fila trip.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh, wonderful,\u201d she says kindly, starting to type on her computer. \u201cWelcome. We\u2019re so happy to have you and the rest of your group here.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She takes his ID, and after a bit more typing, grabs two keycards from under the counter. \u201cWe\u2019ve upgraded your room to one of our swim-up suites with an ocean view,\u201d she says, sliding the keycards across the counter towards him. \u201cComplimentary.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh, really? Awesome,\u201d Jimin says, taking the keys. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be on the ground floor, since it\u2019s a swim-up. You\u2019re in room 186. You\u2019ll want to exit this building, walk to the right, and follow the path down until you reach the villa building. The signs there will point you in the direction of your room.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSorry, what\u2019s a swim-up?\u201d Jungkook asks slowly. \u201cDoes that mean we have to\u2026 swim up to it?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The woman bursts into polite laughter. \u201cOh, no, not at all. Your room has two doors, one leading to the inside hall and one to the outside patio, both of which are very much accessible by land. A swim-up means that you can enter the pool directly from your patio. You\u2019ll have a semi-private area of the pool located right next to your room, which is connected to one of the larger public pools, so you can use the pool and swim directly back to your room.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhoa. Cool,\u201d Jungkook says.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou two should be all set. If you need anything, please don\u2019t hesitate to call the front desk. I hope you enjoy your stay.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Jungkook tells her, bowing a little. Jimin smiles and says thank you as well. Jungkook grabs Jimin\u2019s hand and leads him away from the desk.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They head out of the building and to the right, down a winding brick path lined with bright orange and yellow flowers, fragrant and sweet, the warm sun beating down on them from above. It eventually leads them to the smaller building which houses the swim-up suites. The back side of the structure is right up against a large pool, and the seemingly endless ocean is visible beyond it in the distance, down the steep slope of the hill.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook pulls open the door to the building and they enter the hall on the ground floor, the air conditioning practically punching them in the face with its intensity. Jimin wheels his suitcase behind him, and they easily find their room after a couple of twists and turns down the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI can\u2019t believe they upgraded us for free,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI mean, we weren\u2019t paying for anything anyway, but still.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI know. The pool thing seems really cool. Plus, I was hoping we\u2019d get an ocean view room, so I\u2019m really happy,\u201d Jimin says, rummaging in his pocket for the keycard and pulling it out. He holds it against the door and it lights up green, unlocking with a click. \u201cThe ocean always reminds me of home.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBusan, you mean, right?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin nods, pushing the door open. \u201cYeah. Sometimes I really miss\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Jimin walks into the room, the words die on his lips.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is going to be a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The room itself is gorgeous. There\u2019s no problem with the <em>room</em>. It\u2019s all white and airy and sunny, and the far wall is made completely of glass, fitted with a sliding door that leads out to the patio and pool. It smells fresh, like summer and greenery, and there\u2019s tasteful art on the walls, and it\u2019s probably\u2014no, definitely\u2014the most expensive hotel room Jimin will ever stay in.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s all fine. That\u2019s not the problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The problem is the giant king bed sitting in the middle of the room, perfectly made with soft and pristine white bedding, adorned with piles of fluffy white pillows neatly propped up against the headboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is no other bed. It\u2019s the <em>only</em> bed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook bursts into laughter behind him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At first, Jimin assumes he\u2019s laughing at their predicament, but as he takes a couple of steps closer, he realizes what\u2019s actually caught Jungkook\u2019s attention. It\u2019s impossible for Jimin to imagine something that could make this situation <em>more </em>awkward, but as it turns out, he doesn\u2019t have to imagine, because there it is, right in front of him: two folded towel animals\u2014swans, to be precise\u2014fucking in the middle of the bed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yes, fucking. If this was a polite and civilized resort, the staff probably would have positioned the swans in some sort of romantic heart shape, or maybe simply sitting next to each other, side by side, like well-mannered swans ought to be. But no. There is no doubt about the way these swans have been posed: they are in the throes of passion, hitting it from the back, doggy style.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin\u2019s cheeks are flaming hot. He spins around to face Jungkook. \u201cWe have to request a different room.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAre you that offended by the swans? We can just move them\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not about the swans!\u201d Jimin screeches. \u201cI\u2019m talking about there only being one bed.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jungkook says, blinking. \u201cRight.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI specifically requested a room with two beds.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI mean, our original room probably had two beds. I guess this room only has one because we got upgraded.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just call the front desk and let them know we need a new room,\u201d Jimin says, heading over to the nightstand by the bed, where the room\u2019s phone is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook wanders across the room, stopping to peer through the glass wall. \u201cBut Jimin\u2026wait. Come look at this.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin walks up beside him, staring through the glass. His eyes go a little round as he takes it all in. The patio area outside their room is huge. There\u2019s a tile-floored area with a table and chairs, and next to it, there\u2019s a full-sized hot tub. To the left of that, there\u2019s the semi-private pool the receptionist had described. It\u2019s small and oval-shaped, with stairs leading into the pool right off their patio, only a couple of steps beyond their door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The whole area is rather private\u2014there are walls on either side of the patio, and the balconies jutting out from the rooms above offer a bit of shade and privacy from overhead, too. If they were to swim out past their own patio, then they\u2019d be entering the main, larger pool that presumably connects to all the swim-up rooms on the floor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWow,\u201d Jimin says, in awe. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe\u2019d probably be giving this up if we got a different room, right? I bet they would just put us in a regular room.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin sighs. \u201cI mean, yes. You\u2019re right. But if we stay in this room, we\u2019ll have to share a bed.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs that really so awful?\u201d Jungkook asks, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI mean, I want you to be comfortable\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong. But it\u2019s a king, so it\u2019s probably big enough that you\u2019ll hardly notice me. I\u2019ll keep to my own side. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s kind of hilarious that Jungkook actually believes Jimin could share a bed with him and not be constantly thinking about his presence. Maybe Jungkook doesn\u2019t understand his own power. Maybe he doesn\u2019t realize what he looks like. Maybe he\u2019s never looked in a mirror. Maybe he\u2019s a vampire?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin takes a deep, calming breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou promise?\u201d he asks, still staring out at the patio.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I promise. It\u2019ll just be like, you know, um\u2026 a sleepover. Or something.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ah, yes. Perfect. Exactly the vibes Jimin was hoping for. A <em>sleepover</em> with his crush, who is apparently completely unfazed by the idea of sharing a bed with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFine,\u201d Jimin agrees, trying to shake off some of the tension in his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll keep the room. I love hot tubs too much to give it up.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Jungkook says, smiling brightly. \u201cNow let me just take care of these screwing swans before you get all upset again.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook walks over to the bed, gingerly picking up one of the swans and setting it back down a few inches away from its counterpart. He pats it on the head gently before backing away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Jimin says. He suddenly feels a little sheepish. \u201cI just don\u2019t like it when things don\u2019t go according to plan. Sorry if it seemed like I was freaking out about the bed. I didn\u2019t mean to ruin the mood.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jungkook tells him. \u201cThis is supposed to be a relaxing trip. You quite literally earned it. So try not to worry about anything too much. If something doesn\u2019t go right, we\u2019ll fix it together.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI think the swans made it worse,\u201d Jimin mumbles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJimin, I want you to be comfortable around me,\u201d Jungkook says. His eyebrows are knitted together with worry. Jimin is suddenly overcome with the overwhelming urge to reach up and smooth out the creases. \u201cI understand that what we\u2019re doing\u2014like, the fake affection and stuff\u2014has the potential to make things uncomfortable if you don\u2019t actually feel that way towards me. If you ever want to stop, you can just tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What a strange way for him to have phrased that. Jimin glosses over it, eager to placate him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Jimin rushes to explain. \u201cI am comfortable around you. Really comfortable, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jungkook says. His shoulders relax a little bit. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s good. I\u2019m really comfortable around you, too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI think we just need to accept that this is naturally going to be a little awkward,\u201d Jimin says with a nervous laugh. \u201cI mean, all of it. Sharing a room, sharing a bed, pretending that we\u2019re together for the next four days. It\u2019s a much bigger commitment than what we did at the bar, or at the party. It\u2019s normal for it to be weird. What we\u2019re doing <em>is </em>weird.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI guess so. And I can see how the fucking swans could make it feel, um, weirder.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs that a sentence you ever anticipated you would speak during the course of your lifetime?\u201d Jimin asks as he walks back towards the door to grab his suitcase.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Jimin tells him, sitting down on the edge of the bed. \u201cI just want you to have a good time. You deserve to, after how much you\u2019ve helped me. And considering we have endless amounts of free alcohol at our disposal and don\u2019t even have to leave our room to go to the pool, having a good time should be very easy.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This conversation about worrying is quickly becoming a little too meta for Jimin\u2019s tastes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThen let\u2019s get on with our day,\u201d Jimin says, clapping his hands together. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They end up spending the short remainder of the afternoon exploring the resort and all it has to offer. After they both take a bit of time to freshen up, they leave the room and go for a walk around the expansive grounds, enjoying the comforting smell of the sea and the warmth of the sun on their skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The resort is huge\u2014there\u2019s a variety of different shops and restaurants, two gardens, so many different pools that Jimin starts to lose count, and even more bars than there are pools.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When walking around in the heat starts to wear them out, they dip into a bar near the far edge of the property, an open-air shack with a thatched roof that has no other customers at the moment. They split a bottle of soju, enjoying the breeze from the fans behind the bar, and like everything else with Jungkook has been, it\u2019s easy. It slows down the passage of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sitting next to Jungkook, watching his eyes sparkle as he launches into a story about Seokjin and Hoseok, laughing with him, teasing him\u2014it all makes Jimin so grateful that Jungkook is the one he brought with him on this trip. Grateful that he\u2019s the one who gets to selfishly enjoy Jungkook\u2019s company for the next four days. Even if he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy his company forever.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The more he thinks about it, he can\u2019t believe the odds\u2014he can\u2019t believe that <em>this</em> gem of a human being is the one he randomly grabbed at the bar.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When it starts to get late, they head over to one of the resort\u2019s restaurants for dinner, eating an elaborate three-course meal consisting mostly of seafood. They eat until they\u2019re stuffed, and Jungkook jokes that Jimin is going to have to roll him back down the hill to their room. When they actually approach the hill, Jimin starts to push him, and Jungkook swats him away, laughing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The path down to the building looks a little different in the setting sun, but they manage to find their way back to the room, and Jimin unlocks the door, letting Jungkook go in first.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWow. I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Jungkook says, sliding off his sandals near the door and stretching his arms above his head, yawning. His shirt rides up a little bit, exposing a sliver of hard stomach. Jimin glances away.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI am too,\u201d Jimin admits, perching on the end of the bed. He glances down at his phone, checking the time. \u201cIt\u2019s only eight, though. Way too early to go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMmm. I was considering checking out the gym tonight, but I think I\u2019m too tired. I might go tomorrow instead.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think one single day off will kill you, Mr. Muscles.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cProbably not,\u201d Jungkook agrees. To Jimin\u2019s surprise, he does not object to the nickname.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin walks over to his suitcase in the corner and bends down to rummage through it, pulling out a few random skincare and hygiene items he\u2019ll need for his evening routine. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBefore you do that...\u201d Jungkook says. Jimin turns around to glance at him. \u201cWhat if we went in the hot tub? That seems like a nice enough way to pass the time.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin\u2019s muscles, sore and achy from a long day of travelling and walking around, practically start singing at the thought. \u201cThat sounds amazing. I\u2019m kind of sore, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, it should help relax your muscles,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cPlus, you deserve some actual relaxation time before Fila inhumanely forces you to work tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cStop,\u201d Jimin says, laughing. He digs back into his suitcase, pulling out one of the pairs of swim shorts he\u2019d packed. They\u2019re turquoise with tiny lemons embroidered on them. \u201cThey\u2019re paying for this trip, remember? Besides, it\u2019ll hardly be anything. I don\u2019t even think it will take the full day. Do you know what you\u2019re going to do while I\u2019m out?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook hums. \u201cProbably go to the gym, since I\u2019m not going tonight. Maybe go lay on the beach.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat sounds nice, \u201cJimin says, sighing. He looks down at the shorts in his hands, then glances back up at Jungkook awkwardly. \u201cI guess we should\u2026 change?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook says, picking his backpack up off the floor and plopping it onto the bed. He searches around in there for a few moments, then looks up at Jimin. \u201cUm.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ll go change in the bathroom!\u201d Jimin says way too enthusiastically, rushing off in that direction. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know before I come out, in case you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin slips through the open bathroom door and closes it behind him hastily, leaning back against it with a sigh.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The most challenging part of the trip is already beginning, apparently. You know, the part where he has to see Jungkook half-naked and pretend he doesn\u2019t care at all, since there\u2019s nobody around to witness him caring about it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin feels inexplicably self-conscious about changing into his own bathing suit, too. He has a nice body\u2014and he knows that\u2014but there\u2019s something about stripping down in front of Jungkook that\u2019s terribly intimidating, despite how otherwise comfortable Jimin feels around him. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that he isn\u2019t sure how much Jungkook will actually care to look.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGet out of your head,\u201d he mumbles to himself, unbuttoning his shirt and slipping it off his shoulders. His shorts come next, then his boxers, and then he pulls the swim trunks up and over his thighs, lacing them at the waist. They sit pretty low on his hips, and the tight fit doesn\u2019t leave anything about his ass to the imagination. Jimin briefly wonders if they\u2019re too inappropriate. He analyzes himself in the mirror for a moment, turning to look at himself from the side.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIf he stares at your ass, that\u2019s his problem, not yours,\u201d Jimin says to himself in the mirror. \u201cActually, you know what\u2014it\u2019s not a problem at all. It\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He folds his clothes on the counter, then opens the bathroom door a tiny crack. \u201cJungkook? Are you dressed?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYup,\u201d Jungkook calls out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin leaves the bathroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he catches sight of Jungkook standing over by the glass door, Jimin\u2019s eyes go comically round. He desperately attempts to regain control of his facial expression, plastering on what he hopes is a neutral look before Jungkook can realize he\u2019s staring at him like some sort of crazed animal.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He tries to swallow, but he can\u2019t\u2014his mouth has suddenly gone dry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh, Jimin knew this was going to be bad, but he didn\u2019t know just <em>how</em> bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook is shirtless, unfortunately, and he\u2019s wearing a pair of navy blue swim trunks. They\u2019re fitted and they only come down to about mid-thigh. He has both arms raised, pulling the top of his hair into a half-ponytail, his biceps and shoulders flexing. His entire right arm is covered in tattoos, the artwork dense and dark and swirling all the way up to his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His arms and abs and chest are all clearly defined, but he\u2019s not so muscular that he\u2019s bulky or big. His skin is golden and smooth, all soft against hard muscle, and his waist is impossibly slender compared to his broad shoulders. His shorts are riding perilously low, slipping down even further as he raises up his arms again to adjust his ponytail, tightening it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin has forgotten how to speak.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He lets his eyes roam lower. Just for a moment. And that\u2019s when he sees it\u2014a large tattoo on Jungkook\u2019s right thigh, the bottom edge of it just barely peeking out from beneath his swim trunks. Jimin can\u2019t tell what it is. Primarily because he\u2019s gone a little cross-eyed. Why is it so hot in here?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m going to turn up the air conditioning,\u201d Jimin announces hoarsely, walking over to the thermostat and aggressively pressing the button a few more times than is probably necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, adjusting his shorts slightly. He pads over to the sliding glass door in his bare feet. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYup,\u201d Jimin confirms, his voice artificially strained.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin follows Jungkook outside. Since they\u2019ve returned to the room, the sun has all but set, leaving only a few hints of pink and purple streaking across the otherwise black sky. They can\u2019t see the ocean anymore, but they can still hear the waves lapping against the shore in the distance and smell its familiar salt in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The vibe out here on the patio is totally different at night. Most of the light is coming from their brightly illuminated pool, glowing soft and cyan in the dark. The hot tub has a few dim bulbs along its inside walls, as well, but it\u2019s not as bright as the pool.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs that the last of them?\u201d Jungkook asks as Jimin slides the door shut behind them.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin turns to look at him, trying very determinedly to keep his gaze at eye level. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOf your tattoos.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook is not looking at Jimin\u2019s face. He\u2019s looking at his body. Jimin glances down, following Jungkook's line of sight, then realizes that Jungkook is staring at the tattoo on his ribs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh. Yup,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook hums. \u201cI like it. Your tattoos all really suit you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cUm, thanks. Yours do, they\u2014yours are\u2026 nice.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apparently Jungkook\u2019s state of half-undress has rendered Jimin completely unable to form a coherent thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Jungkook says. He looks like he\u2019s fighting back a smile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Surely, over the next four days, Jimin will eventually get accustomed to seeing Jungkook like this. For the sake of his mental health, he <em>must</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook nods at the hot tub. \u201cYou go first,\u201d Jungkook tells him. \u201cTell me how hot it is.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhy? You scared of a little heat?\u201d Jimin asks, making his way down the three stairs leading into the hot tub, hissing quietly as the hot water makes contact with his bare legs. It\u2019s hotter than he was expecting, but it feels <em>amazing</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once he\u2019s all the way in, the water hits him mid-waist. He maneuvers his way over to the far side, turning around and sliding down to sit on the built-in bench, sinking down until the water is all the way up to his shoulders. He positions himself so there\u2019s a jet directly behind him, massaging his sore back muscles.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He sighs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d Jimin murmurs, closing his eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not too hot?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMm-mmm,\u201d Jimin says, eyes still closed.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t see it, but he feels it: the gentle ripple of the water as Jungkook steps in, the feel of Jungkook\u2019s calves brushing against Jimin\u2019s own as he sinks down onto the bench across from him, sighing. The hot tub is technically big enough for two, but Jungkook\u2019s legs are long.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin opens his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now that Jungkook has settled in, most of his body is concealed by the water, thankfully, except for his bare shoulders. His arms are spread out, resting along the sides of the hot tub. Maybe Jimin can actually manage to have a conversation with him like this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ve gotta say, I\u2019m glad you convinced me to keep the room,\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMe too. Imagine if we had to fight with all the other people\u2014I mean, <em>peasants</em>\u2014over the shared hot tubs instead? That would have been unimaginable.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin swirls the water in front of him with his hand. \u201cImagine not having our own pool? Imagine having to wake up early every day to scavenge for a lounge chair that isn\u2019t taken yet? I\u2019m not built to withstand that kind of struggle. I wouldn\u2019t have survived.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMaybe the receptionist could sense it,\u201d Jungkook says, his brow furrowing in realization. \u201cShe gave us the complimentary upgrade because she knew it would save our lives.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI forgot to text Yoongi and brag about it,\u201d Jimin suddenly remembers. \u201cI love making him mad. It\u2019s one of my favorite pastimes. I need to send him a picture tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt sounded like he really wanted to go on this trip. If it wasn\u2019t for me, I bet he would have talked you into taking him instead.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh, absolutely not. Taehyung would have never allowed it. I mean, like, not because he would be jealous, but because <em>he</em> would want to come as my plus one instead. I would have brought him, probably, if I hadn\u2019t brought you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI am once again feeling very lucky to be your fake boyfriend,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. He brushes some hair out of his eyes with wet hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOnce again?\u201d Jimin asks, tilting his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook looks slightly startled by the question. \u201cOh. Yeah, I just mean\u2014it seems to be working out rather well for me. I\u2019m on a free vacation, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Jimin agrees, closing his eyes again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s very relaxing out here. There isn\u2019t much splashing or laughter happening at the main pool, which is mostly out of their line of sight. It\u2019s that time of the evening where everyone starts to transition into night mode: showering, going out to dinner, starting their first round of drinks. Jimin and Jungkook are the earlybirds tonight, apparently, since they\u2019ve slid in for their pre-bedtime soak barely past eight thirty. Jimin isn\u2019t used to that\u2014usually, he\u2019d be the one hitting the bars early and staying out until they close\u2014but he really doesn\u2019t mind the change. This is nice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin hadn\u2019t realized how desperately he was in need of some relaxation, but he can feel the tension rapidly melting out of his body the longer they sit here. Knots that have been there for months are starting to untie themselves. It\u2019s been a long time since he felt like this. <em>Now</em> he\u2019s wishing he didn\u2019t have to deal with the company itinerary tomorrow, because he never wants to leave the hot tub again. He could die here and be happy about it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAfter my workshops, let\u2019s keep the rest of the trip very low key,\u201d Jimin declares. \u201cLike, no energy expenditure whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI guess the 17 kilometer hike across the mountain I was going to suggest for Thursday is a no-go, then.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin stares at him blankly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing. His eyes are sparkling, reflecting the blue light of the pool.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin splashes him with a little water. \u201cYou scared me. For a minute, I feared we might be truly incompatible.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re definitely not incompatible.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI know. Wait, what\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI despise cardio,\u201d Jungkook interrupts him. \u201cHiking is like literal, actual torture for me. Running, too. I would rather burn in hell. I would never, ever seriously suggest a hike.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cReally? I would have assumed you were into all that stuff. Since you\u2019re, like, you know. Since you have\u2014um. Since you look\u2014\u201d Jimin vaguely gestures in Jungkook\u2019s direction, floundering.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou mean my body?\u201d Jungkook looks a little bashful all of a sudden. He runs a wet hand through his hair again. \u201cIt\u2019s from weight training, mostly. I have a personal trainer. I would never be able to figure out workouts and all that stuff by myself. Since I have to sit at a desk for like nine hours a day, I try to stay healthy.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou do seem very healthy,\u201d Jimin blurts out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook looks at him quizzically. \u201cOh. Thank you?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnyway, I just want to be lazy the whole time we\u2019re here,\u201d Jimin says, trying to regain his footing. \u201cWe should have done this from the beginning. Walking around earlier was fine, but\u2026 this is better.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIf you want to be lazy, we can be lazy,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. His leg brushes against Jimin\u2019s underneath the water, and Jimin doesn\u2019t pull away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Being lazy with Jungkook sounds like the best possible way to pass the time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So they immediately get some practice\u2014they stay in the hot tub until their fingers get pruny, listening to the birds calling quietly in the distance and the calming drone of the ocean waves in the dark. They talk for a while, relaxed with voices low, and never about anything serious. The lulls in conversation are filled with a calm quiet that isn\u2019t uncomfortable at all. By the time they get out, it\u2019s nearly ten thirty.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They towel off and head back inside.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Getting ready for bed is about as awkward as Jimin imagined it would be: relatively, but not unbearably so. They take turns in the bathroom, each of them taking a quick shower, washing the chlorine out of their hair, taking advantage of the privacy in there to get dressed when they\u2019re done, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin goes second, and after he finishes his skincare routine, he comes out of the bathroom to find Jungkook already under the covers on the left side of the bed. His hair is messy and towel-dried, and he\u2019s wearing a plain white t-shirt, his cheeks still a little flushed from the hours spent in the hot tub, his cell phone screen lighting up his face in the otherwise dim light of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sight makes Jimin\u2019s stomach flip.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI hope it\u2019s okay that I took this side,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you had a preference.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThat side is fine,\u201d Jimin reassures him, crossing the room and plugging in his phone by the nightstand on the other side of the bed. The lamp on that table is the only one that\u2019s still on.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He climbs into bed, carefully positioning himself so that he\u2019s fairly close to the edge. There\u2019s only a couple of feet separating him and Jungkook. Which is a totally respectable and platonic amount of feet, he thinks. It should not make him feel nervous at all. He does <em>not</em> need to freak out over the fact that they are now sharing a bed. Officially.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He scrunches his eyes shut, praying Jungkook can\u2019t hear the sound of his hammering heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs it okay if I turn the light off?\u201d Jimin asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jungkook mumbles something in assent, and then Jimin can feel his body shifting on the mattress slightly, springs creaking with the movement. Maybe he\u2019s setting his phone on the bedside table. Jimin is too scared to look. Not that he could look, anyway, since his eyes are still closed.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He is not handling this well. He needs to get this infatuation under control before he has a full-blown heart attack.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jimin takes a deep breath and opens his eyes. Then he leans over, flicking the switch on the table lamp, plunging them into darkness. He shimmies back down until he\u2019s all the way under the covers, rolling onto his side, facing away from Jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Jimin murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGoodnight, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook says quietly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now it\u2019s time to sleep. Rationally, Jimin understands this. He closes his eyes, but he doesn\u2019t feel tired at all. His mind refuses to shut down.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The air conditioner hums. It\u2019s quiet. This should be a perfectly conducive environment for sleeping. But all Jimin can think about is the warm and kind and enigmatic person lying next to him, close enough to touch.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wonders what it would be like to touch him. Jimin\u2019s touched him before, sure, but not like this. Not in a bed. Not with nobody looking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Jungkook is just barely out of his reach, the same way he\u2019s always been, ever since Jimin first laid eyes on him at the bar.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Disappointingly, Jungkook clearly isn\u2019t as nervous about this as Jimin is, because after only a few minutes, Jimin can hear his breaths have evened out, slow and steady, a dead giveaway that he\u2019s already fast asleep.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And eventually, although it takes a little while, Jimin lets the quiet, rhythmic sound of Jungkook\u2019s breathing lull him to sleep, his limbs feeling heavier once he finally allows himself to relax.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He drifts off with his face firmly pressed into the pillow, and as he goes, he accepts that he\u2019ll probably end up dreaming about Jungkook, which seems like a rather ironic thing to do while they\u2019re sharing a bed.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"s3\">\u3000</span> \u0489<span class=\"s3\">\u3000</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Jimin wakes up the next morning, bright rays of sunshine are streaming through the glass wall, reflecting and shining directly into his eyes. He winces, barely awake, shifting his body slightly, trying to orient himself in the unfamiliar bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As he moves, he realizes there\u2019s something unfamiliar touching his cheek. Warm, soft... skin? He opens his eyes, squinting. He\u2019s greeted by the sight of a tattooed arm so close to his face that it takes a moment for his eyes to focus on it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin wakes up the rest of the way with a jolt, his eyes flying open in panic.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He quickly assesses the situation. Jungkook still seems to be asleep, and Jimin quickly thanks every single deity he\u2019s ever heard of for that, because the situation they\u2019re in is\u2014well, it\u2019s compromising, to say the least.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They must have gravitated towards each other in their sleep. Jimin is much closer to the center of the bed than he remembers, and Jungkook\u2019s arm is flung out over Jimin\u2019s head. Jimin\u2019s cheek is pressed to his bicep. Jungkook\u2019s other arm is loosely draped over Jimin\u2019s waist, and Jimin has both calves tangled up in Jungkook\u2019s legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They vaguely resemble some sort of human pretzel. It\u2019s not entirely clear who is ultimately responsible for it. Jimin blinks, comically frozen, trying not to move a single muscle.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">How the hell is he going to untangle himself without waking Jungkook up?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Because waking Jungkook up, allowing him to discover this, is <em>not</em> an option. What if Jungkook thinks that Jimin snuggled up to him in the middle of the night? How embarrassing. Jimin would never do something like that. Except, well, he did, apparently. So maybe he would. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s going to get out of this before Jungkook has any idea of what\u2019s happened.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He starts with his left leg, slowly pulling it out from between Jungkook\u2019s calves. When he gets it all the way out, Jungkook\u2019s leg falls down onto the mattress with a gentle thud.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook groans.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide. He freezes, holding his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But Jungkook doesn\u2019t wake up. He bends his leg at the knee a little, sighing in his sleep, eyelashes fluttering.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin knows it\u2019s a race against the clock now. He decides to work on Jungkook\u2019s arm next\u2014the one that\u2019s looped around Jimin\u2019s waist. It feels like a dead weight lying on top of him. It\u2019s so heavy, actually, that Jimin wonders how it\u2019s physically possible for it to weigh that much, but now is probably not the time to try and solve that mystery.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin grabs it carefully, wrapping his fingers gently around Jungkook\u2019s forearm, and then he starts to pull it off his body, inch by inch. He stares directly at it, moving very slowly with laser focus.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When he\u2019s finally maneuvered the arm back onto the mattress and he\u2019s about to remove his hand, he looks back up at Jungkook\u2019s face\u2014and he finds Jungkook staring right back at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin yelps, yanking his hand away from Jungkook\u2019s arm like he\u2019s been burned. He pulls his other leg out of the pretzel, then lifts his face off of Jungkook\u2019s other arm, staring at him with wide eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood morning,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, his voice scratchy and deep. He\u2019s barely awake, but there\u2019s a tiny hint of a smile on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood morning,\u201d Jimin croaks, leaning up on one arm and trying to act nonchalant, although that\u2019s probably useless at this point. \u201cI was just\u2026 it seems like we\u2014I guess overnight, we\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI probably should have warned you about that,\u201d Jungkook says, still sounding sleepy. \u201cMy friends call me a koala, sometimes, because I just latch onto things in my sleep. I was going to try not to do it to you, but\u2026 I guess that was kind of dumb, in retrospect, since I\u2019m asleep when it happens.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says weakly. \u201cA koala. Okay. Yes. I see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook says, rubbing some sleep out of his eyes. \u201cWe can build a pillow fortress between us tonight, if you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>I absolutely do not want!</em> is what Jimin would like to say.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin ponders how he can communicate that without blowing his cover. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d is what he settles on, trying to sound casual. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I get cold at night, anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He silently curses at himself. That did <em>not</em> sound cool and unbothered. That sounded very much like: <em>\u201cNo! I am begging you to snuggle me, if you erect a wall of pillows between us I will quite literally freeze to death, your body heat is all I\u2019ve ever wanted, let me be your bamboo stalk, I\u2019m ready and willing\u2014\u201d\u00a0</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, rolling onto his back and stretching his arms above his head, yawning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Well. That\u2019s that, apparently.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Jimin asks, sitting up in bed and combing fingers through his hair, trying to smooth it down. His cheeks feel hot. \u201cI\u2019ll be eating breakfast with my coworkers this morning.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t usually get hungry until later,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I can hunt down some food.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin slips out of bed and slides his feet into the slippers he\u2019d left waiting on the floor last night. \u201cAre you getting up now, or do you want more sleep? I can get ready in the bathroom, so it\u2019ll be quiet out here, if you want to sleep more.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I should get up and go to the gym anyways,\u201d Jungkook says, sitting up and leaning over to check his phone. It feels so strangely intimate, seeing him like this, all bleary-eyed with messy hair in the early morning light.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He stays in bed for a little while longer, scrolling through his phone as Jimin gets ready for the day. There\u2019s a big conference room in the main hotel building where Jimin is supposed to meet everyone at 9AM sharp. He\u2019s not sure exactly when they\u2019ll be done, but he assumes it will be sometime in the afternoon. Jimin gets dressed, then packs his backpack with some essentials: his work laptop, a water bottle, an extra tube of sunscreen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll text you whenever I\u2019m finished,\u201d Jimin calls out to Jungkook from the bathroom, where he\u2019s leaning forward and combing his hair in the mirror. \u201cAnd then I can just come meet you wherever you are. There\u2019s a dinner tonight, by the way\u2014it\u2019s optional, but we should go, because Namjoon will be there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh? Is it fancy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s on the beach,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cShould be nice enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat does sound nice. I will be on my best boyfriend behavior.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you. If you\u2019re very good, I\u2019ll introduce you to Namjoon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Jungkook sounds excited. \u201cAh, I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019ll probably say something dumb.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cImpossible,\u201d Jimin reassures him, stepping out of the bathroom and slinging his backpack over his shoulder. He slides out of his slippers, then into the sandals he\u2019d left by the door last night. \u201cYou good? Need anything before I go?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Jungkook says, sitting up and swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. \u201cHave a good day, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s such a domestic and boyfriend-like thing for him to say, especially while perched on the edge of the bed they shared last night, that it makes Jimin stutter for a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, um\u2014I will. Don\u2019t have too much fun without me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin slips out the door, letting it swing closed behind him, then makes his way down the hall and into the bright heat of the early morning sun. He puts on his sunglasses, muttering to himself as he heads down the path towards the main building.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou usually have no trouble with flirting at all,\u201d he grumbles, adjusting his backpack on his shoulder. \u201cYou flirt with everyone! You flirt with inanimate objects! Why are you being so fucking awkward!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A frog leaps across the path in front of him, croaking twice, like he\u2019s directly answering him: <em>It\u2019s because you really like him, you idiot.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNobody asked you,\u201d Jimin tells the frog, carefully stepping around it. It croaks once more before hopping away. \u201cHave a good day, though. And be careful. I almost stepped on you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Jimin enters the conference room, he\u2019s one of the first few to arrive, and after nodding a few polite hellos to his coworkers, he plops down at an empty table, pulling his laptop out of his backpack and connecting it to the hotel wifi. If he has a few extra minutes, he figures he might as well use it to catch up on work stuff.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He scrolls through his email inbox, trying to scan through and open anything that seems important. He has hundreds of unread emails already, so it\u2019s a little difficult to wade through the mess. He almost misses it as he\u2019s scrolling, but he spots it just before it vanishes off the top of the screen\u2014from late last night, there\u2019s an email from Yoongi.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s unusual for Yoongi to email him about work-related things. Usually, he\u2019d just text him instead. Jimin clicks on the email, one eyebrow raised.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><b>From</b>: Min Yoongi &lt;<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"4924202767302626272e20092f202528672a2667223b\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>&gt;<br>\n<b>Date</b>: August 5, 2021, 9:49PM<br>\n<b>Subject: </b>Fwd: Finance team opening</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hey you,</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Some intel about the motherfucker.

Park Hyungsik has put in his two week\u2019s notice, and Jeong Ryung will be stepping up to fill the team lead role, but that leaves us in desperate need of a replacement for him, as the team is already understaffed. The position will be posted tomorrow. Please check and see if anyone might be a good candidate for an inter-departmental transfer.</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span>\n<em>Best,</em><br>\nKim Eunji<br>\nSenior Recruiter\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks at his computer screen, processing the news. Hyungsik is leaving Fila?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His first reaction is overwhelming relief. If Hyungsik is leaving, that means Jimin will never have to see him again. It means Jimin will actually be able to go down to the finance department floor without having to send someone else in his place. Most importantly, it means Jimin can finally move on and forget all about Hyungsik\u2014faced with no more awkward reminders of what they were, or what he did to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin quickly realizes something else, though. If he\u2019s never going to see Hyungsik again, that means there\u2019s definitely not going to be any reason to carry on his fake boyfriend arrangement with Jungkook beyond this trip.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He sort of figured that might be the case, anyway, but the finality of it squeezes his heart in a vice grip that he wasn\u2019t expecting at all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s sure that he and Jungkook will still be friends when this is all over, but it won\u2019t be the same as this. It won\u2019t be the same as this weird, thrilling, confusing thing they\u2019re doing right now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin frowns, leaning back in his chair. Why does he feel more upset about breaking up with his fake boyfriend than he felt about breaking up with his <em>real</em> boyfriend?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey, you,\u201d a voice says directly behind Jimin, and a friendly hand clamps down on his shoulder. Jimin jumps in his seat a little, startled out of his thoughts.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to catch you by surprise,\u201d Namjoon says. \u201cI just wanted to say hi since I hadn\u2019t seen you yet. Are you having a good time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Jimin says, forcing a smile. \u201cSorry. I was just zoned out. Yes, this resort is really nice. You really outdid yourself this year, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Namjoon smiles. \u201cOnly the best for my best of the best. You like your room?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey gave us an insane upgrade. We\u2019re in one of the swim-up suites. We have our own hot tub and pool. It is the fanciest hotel room I have ever seen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about that,\u201d Namjoon whispers. \u201cThe others, I mean.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin raises an eyebrow, lowering his voice. \u201cWait. Are <em>you</em> the one who got us upgraded?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can neither confirm nor deny that,\u201d Namjoon says in a dramatic whisper.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cNo way. Namjoon, you didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know,\u201d Namjoon says, cutting him off. \u201cBut you deserve it. So enjoy it. Is your boyfriend enjoying himself?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBoyfriend? My\u2014oh. Right. My boyfriend. Yeah, he is. He\u2019s just gonna have a lazy day today while I\u2019m occupied. Well, his version of a lazy day, which means he\u2019s going to the gym.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGoing to the gym on vacation,\u201d Namjoon says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s a nice person, Jimin, but that\u2019s a red flag.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin bursts into laughter. \u201cI\u2019m with you on that one. But, no, he is a nice person. You\u2019ll meet him tonight, hopefully.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d Namjoon slaps Jimin on the shoulder again. \u201cEnjoy yourself this week, okay? I\u2019ll try not to drag out the festivities too long today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Jimin says, smiling. \u201cI hope you get to relax while you\u2019re here, too. I think you deserve it <em>slightly</em> more than I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAfter today, you won\u2019t hear a peep from me,\u201d Namjoon assures him. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the pool for three days straight. I even brought my own inflatable swan floatie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI am not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t mention swans to me. I\u2019m going to start having war flashbacks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Namjoon asks, eyebrows furrowing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNothing. But it was your fault, apparently.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. With you, I learned not to ask questions a long time ago. I apologize in advance if you see me in my swan floatie and it triggers any\u2026 unpleasant feelings.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Namjoon smiles an awkward smile, then leaves to go talk to someone at the next table over. Jimin resumes scanning his email inbox, trying not to think too much more about the news of Hyungsik\u2019s departure.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Although Jimin would rather not be trapped in this windowless conference room while he\u2019s on vacation, the day of activities passes by rather quickly. They start out with opening remarks from Namjoon, thanking everyone for being there and talking a bit more in depth about Fila\u2019s strategy for the next year. There are a couple of different presentations from HR and marketing, as well as a few team-building activities, and a brainstorming workshop to come up with new methods of collaborating between different divisions.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They have breaks for breakfast and lunch, too, but by the time 3PM rolls around and the brainstorming activity ends, it\u2019s obvious that everyone is getting antsy. The woman sitting across the table from Jimin looks like she\u2019s at risk of falling asleep. One of their other table companions excused himself to go to the bathroom an hour ago and just never came back. Jimin figures he\u2019s already two beers deep by now.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Namjoon walks to the front of the room at that point, clearing his throat to get everyone\u2019s attention.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think I\u2019ve made you all suffer enough. As a token of my appreciation, before you go, I\u2019d like to do a quick drawing and hand out some prizes. Consider it my way of saying thank you for putting in a little work while all your spouses and family members were relaxing on the beach.\u201d There\u2019s a polite chorus of laughter around the room. \u201cThese are vouchers to be used for resort activities. Some are for excursions, some are for the spa, and so on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Namjoon walks over to the nearest table, where there\u2019s a clear glass vase filled with tiny folded slips of paper, along with a stack of what Jimin assumes are the aforementioned vouchers. Then he starts drawing names out of the vase\u2014five total, since there are five vouchers to be given away. Someone wins a zipline excursion, and the next person wins a mud facial at the hotel spa.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur next winner is\u2026\u201d Namjoon digs into the vase, pulling out the next slip of paper with a flourish. He unfolds it, then smiles brightly. \u201cPark Jimin!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is rigged,\u201d someone complains from the next table over, but they\u2019re obviously kidding. Jimin laughs, shaking his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou win\u2026\u201d Namjoon picks up a voucher from the top of the stack. \u201cA couple\u2019s massage at the spa!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks. A couple\u2019s massage? What does that\u2026 entail, exactly? He\u2019s never had a massage before. What, in particular, makes it a <em>couple\u2019s</em> massage? He has many questions. <em>None</em> of which he can ask Namjoon. Or anyone, actually. He\u2019ll need to search it up on Naver later.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He forces himself to smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d he tells Namjoon, walking up to collect his voucher. \u201cThat sounds\u2026 lovely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Namjoon winks at him when he hands him the voucher, which Jimin finds very concerning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re free to go after Namjoon has handed out the rest of the prizes, so Jimin packs up his laptop in his backpack, eager to head back to the room and get changed. There are only a couple of hours until the dinner on the beach, so he wants to be sure to squeeze in some poolside time beforehand.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As he walks out of the conference room and exits the building, stepping into the bright afternoon sun, he slips his phone out of his pocket, checking his texts, since he\u2019s been MIA pretty much all day. He has texts from Taehyung and Jungkook. He taps on the one from Taehyung first.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>taehyung</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">1:47PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>so :) did i win yet :)\u00a0</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin laughs, rolling his eyes. He types a quick response, glancing up every now and then to ensure he avoids any potential crash collisions with sassy frogs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>jimin</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:13PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>no, you didn\u2019t. sorry love. i think yoongi might have this one in the bag.</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>taehyung</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:14PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>????? absolutely not. you still have two more nights there. this game is far from over.\u00a0</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>honestly, though, i\u2019m kind of surprised?? i really thought you were into him</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>jimin</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:15PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>i have avoided speaking with you about it, because that would make it into...a thing, but yes, i have realized i am very much into him</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>taehyung</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:16PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>!!!!!

He exits the conversation, tapping to view Jungkook\u2019s texts instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>boyfriend </b>\n</span>\n<span class=\"s3\">\ud83d\udc96</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">11:34AM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>done my workout! the gym is really nice, and there was basically no one there</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>jimin</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:22PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>probably because you are the only weirdo who wants to work out on vacation</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>what are you up to now? i just got done with my work stuff</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>boyfriend </b>\n</span>\n<span class=\"s3\">\ud83d\udc96</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:23PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>oh hello! yay! come hang out with me :)\u00a0</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>i\u2019m by the pool, if you swim out from our patio to the big pool, i\u2019m in one of the chairs on the right side</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<b>jimin</b>\n</span>\n<b> </b>\n<span class=\"s1\">3:24PM</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>ok! lemme change and then i\u2019ll meet you</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin makes swift work of getting changed once he gets back to their room. It\u2019s a little weird, being alone in here, able to just change out in the open. He sifts through his suitcase until he finds his other pair of swim trunks\u2014the pink ones with daisies embroidered on them\u2014then puts them on, not bothering with a shirt, since he\u2019s going to be swimming through the pool to get to Jungkook anyway.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That means he can\u2019t take his phone, either, so he leaves everything but the room key, sliding it into the pocket of his swim shorts. He doesn\u2019t even bring shoes. Just walks out onto the patio in his bare feet, climbs into the pool, and starts lazily paddling his way out to the main pool.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He hangs a right, avoiding two teenage girls in the middle of a splash fight, and he eventually spots Jungkook lying back in a reclined lounge chair. He\u2019s underneath the shade of an umbrella, and there\u2019s a half-empty beer bottle on the little table next to him. He\u2019s got one arm swung over his eyes, and a paperback book is resting on his bare stomach, opened and turned over to keep his place.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAm I interrupting your afternoon siesta?\u201d Jimin asks, hoisting himself out of the pool in front of where Jungkook is lying. He does his best to not splash him, running both hands through his wet hair to push it back off his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook removes the arm from his face, smiling lazily when he sees Jimin. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks at him. \u201cMe? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCome here,\u201d Jungkook says, sitting up and setting his book aside, then reaching out to drag another lounge chair closer to him, so that it\u2019s partially under the shade of the umbrella. He pats the chair.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin walks over and sits. \u201cHave you been out here for a while?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cFor a few hours. I just had a beer, but it made me sleepy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin allows himself to steal one full-body glance. Jungkook\u2019s wearing black swim trunks today, slightly longer than the ones he wore last night, so his thigh tattoo isn\u2019t visible at all. His hair is damp, starting to curl slightly, and there\u2019s a thin sheen of something\u2014Jimin\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s sweat or pool water\u2014glistening on his chest and across his collarbones. He has very nice collarbones.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you have sunscreen?\u201d Jimin asks, swiveling away to face the pool. \u201cSince I swam over, I couldn\u2019t bring anything with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nods, angling his head towards the small table between them. Jungkook\u2019s cell phone and a bottle of sunscreen are sitting underneath it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin grabs the sunscreen, squeezing some out into his hands, then starts rubbing it into his arms and shoulders. It smells good\u2014like coconut and banana. It reminds Jimin of his childhood, of long days spent by the sea, with sticky feet covered in sand.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDinner on the beach starts at five thirty,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cSo we only have a little while before we\u2019ll need to go back and shower.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWho eats that early?\u201d Jungkook whines. \u201cI wanna nap.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s supposed to be like a big party. So dinner is earlier because there will be drinks afterward. Making an appearance is the most important part, though, so once we do that, it doesn\u2019t matter how long we stay.\u201d Jimin tilts his head to the side, rubbing sunscreen into his neck.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you need me to do your back?\u201d Jungkook offers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Panic bells instantly start ringing inside Jimin\u2019s head. It <em>would</em> be helpful, since Jimin knows he\u2019d miss spots if he tried to do it himself, but\u2014Jungkook\u2019s hands? His big, tattooed hands\u2014are going to be all over him? In <em>public</em>? Is that even allowed? It seems like it should be illegal. Everything about Jungkook seems like it should be illegal, actually.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u00a0\u201cOh. Um, sure! Thanks,\u201d Jimin finds himself saying anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin takes a deep breath, turning around in the chair and swinging his legs over to the other side so that his back is facing Jungkook. Jungkook leans over, picking up the bottle of sunscreen off the ground and squirting some into his hands. He rubs it between his palms to warm it up first\u2014very considerate, Jimin thinks\u2014and then two broad palms are rubbing over Jimin\u2019s shoulder blades, working the sunscreen into his skin.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A tiny strangled noise tries to work its way out of Jimin\u2019s throat, but he manages to keep it in.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow was your work stuff?\u201d Jungkook asks, thumbs rubbing over Jimin\u2019s shoulders. Jimin is not entirely sure if that particular motion is necessary for effective sunscreen application.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was fine,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cOh, actually, I forgot to tell you. I won a prize for us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah?\u201d Jungkook asks, squeezing more sunscreen into his hands and rubbing it into Jimin\u2019s lower back with firm strokes. It is very difficult, but Jimin somehow resists the urge to arch his back like a cat in heat.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmhmm. Namjoon gave out vouchers for stuff around the resort. We won a couple\u2019s massage.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook makes an abrupt noise that sounds halfway between laughing and choking. \u201cOh, really? Wow. How...romantic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin says, laughing weakly. Jungkook is still rubbing his back, although Jimin is pretty sure all the sunscreen must be absorbed by now. He lets his head loll to the side a little bit. It feels like he no longer has any bones. They have evaporated.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d Jungkook says, giving Jimin\u2019s shoulders one final squeeze before leaning back in his chair. \u201cWhen\u2019s the massage? Tomorrow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. He spins around in his chair to face Jungkook again. \u201c10:30AM. Appointment\u2019s already booked and everything. All we have to do is show up. I mean, only if you want to. If it\u2019s going to be too awkward or something\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, no, we should go,\u201d Jungkook insists, lying back in his chair again and picking up his book. \u201cIt\u2019s been forever since I had a massage.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSame,\u201d Jimin says, deciding not to reveal he has never had one before. Apparently Jungkook is not disturbed by the <em>couple\u2019s</em> aspect of the massage, so maybe it will be fine.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin eventually ends up grabbing a pool raft and floating in the pool right in front of where Jungkook is lying, close enough that they can still talk. But time ultimately passes way too quickly, and he\u2019s barely soaked up any sun before it\u2019s time to head back to their room to shower and get ready for dinner.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll walk around the long way, since I have my phone and stuff,\u201d Jungkook says, getting up off the chair and stretching. \u201cI\u2019ll see you back there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin agrees, one leg dangling off his raft, kicking gently in the cool water.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He stares a little too long at Jungkook\u2019s retreating form, admiring the way his back muscles shift as he walks away. Then he closes his eyes, sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He almost shared the news about Hyungsik quitting while they were lounging by the pool, but he changed his mind at the last minute. He\u2019ll try again at dinner. Jungkook deserves to know he\u2019ll be off the hook after this, even if it makes Jimin terribly sad.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span>\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks, tilting his chin up towards Jungkook. \u201cHmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you think Namjoon liked me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles. \u201cYes. You\u2019re very polite when you actually try to be.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook leans a little closer, one eyebrow shifting down worriedly. \u201cHey. I\u2019m polite <em>all</em> the time, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHistorically, you\u2019ve done a few things in my presence that were rather impolite.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re standing under the large white canopy that has been erected on the beach for the company dinner, string lights strung up along the inside of the tent to provide some soft illumination. Outside the tent, it\u2019s nearly pitch black, the dark ocean subtly glittering under the moonlight off in the distance.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019ve stayed longer than Jimin thought they would. After dinner, they mingled with Jimin\u2019s coworkers, and Jimin introduced Jungkook to Namjoon while he was still relatively sober. Namjoon seemed awfully charmed by Jungkook, which is not surprising at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Now they\u2019re a few drinks deep, and they\u2019re standing off to the side of the small dance floor, although they\u2019re not really dancing. They\u2019re just talking, and standing way too close to each other, and looking at each other with starry, googly eyes, and kissing every now and then, just like fake boyfriends ought to do. They\u2019ve always been believable, but there\u2019s not a single person out there they wouldn\u2019t fool tonight.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is taking advantage of every possible opportunity to touch Jungkook in ways that would usually not be permissible, which he probably would have denied if you asked him before tonight, but he\u2019s come to terms with his delusional crush at this point.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d Jungkook asks, dipping his head lower. Jimin\u2019s nose brushes against his cheek. He reaches up and places a hand on Jungkook\u2019s bicep, barely resisting the urge to squeeze. With some alcohol in his system, it seems he\u2019s regained his ability to flirt with Jungkook without blushing and stuttering like a teenager.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYour tongue has been in my mouth on more than one occasion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s impolite. It was consensual, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI suppose it was,\u201d Jimin says, tilting his chin up further.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m only doing my job. I like to do things well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019ve done it very well,\u201d Jimin assures him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhich part?\u201d Jungkook asks, rubbing his thumb along Jimin\u2019s jaw softly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin swallows, trying not to reveal how affected he is. \u201cHmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe fake boyfriend part, or the kissing part?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s drunk enough to be honest.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBoth,\u201d he says quietly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook tilts his head a little. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a good kisser?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t act surprised. I\u2019m sure you must already know you\u2019re good at it,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this is news to you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jungkook says. His hand gently wraps around the back of Jimin\u2019s neck, and Jimin shivers. \u201cThe part that\u2019s news to me is that <em>you</em> think I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says weakly. \u201cWell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook leans in, lips pressing lightly against Jimin\u2019s as his fingers thread through the hair at the nape of Jimin\u2019s neck. Jimin opens up to him immediately, and Jungkook smiles against his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought you said no tongue in front of your coworkers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid I say that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think you did,\u201d Jungkook confirms. \u201cI believe you said you have a reputation to uphold.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin decides it might be a little too obvious if he directly asks Jungkook to stick his tongue down his throat. He just hums instead, then kisses Jungkook one more time, soft and purposely chaste, before pulling away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He suddenly feels like he\u2019s given away too much, so to help offset his painfully transparent desperation, he decides that now would be an ideal time to share the news about Hyungsik.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d Jimin says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHmm?\u201d Jungkook asks, his hand moving from Jimin\u2019s neck down to the small of his back instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI found out Hyungsik is leaving Fila. In two weeks, he\u2019ll be gone. I\u2019ll never have to see him again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook blinks. \u201cOh. Wow. That\u2019s good, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. \u201cYeah, I think so. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s leaving. It\u2019s just\u2026 since I won\u2019t be seeing him again, that means after we get back, you won\u2019t need to pretend to be my boyfriend anymore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin doesn\u2019t know why he expects Jungkook to seem relieved by this news. Maybe it\u2019s because he sort of dragged Jungkook into this against his will, at least at the beginning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But surprisingly, Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem relieved at all. Instead, he\u2019s frowning.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. Okay,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe can still hang out,\u201d Jimin assures him. \u201cWe just won\u2019t have to do\u2026 you know, this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook says, swallowing visibly. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019ll finally be free,\u201d Jimin jokes, tilting his head and trying to smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">This is not going how he expected. It feels like he\u2019s ruined the mood, which is the opposite of what he wanted to do.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess so,\u201d Jungkook says. He sounds terribly despondent.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought you would be more excited about your newfound freedom,\u201d Jimin says, frowning.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook takes a deep breath, then totally transforms his facial expression, plastering on a soft smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Do you wanna get out of here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin says, nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to go back to the room yet, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMe neither. Want to sit on the beach with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles. \u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook leads the way, and Jimin silently follows him. They head out of the tent and onto the dark beach beyond it, slipping off their sandals so they can walk across the sand in their bare feet. As they put distance between themselves and the tent, they veer closer down towards the water, to where the sand is slightly damp and cool beneath their feet. The chattering and clinking of glasses audible from the tent gets further and further away, eventually drowned out by the sound of the waves.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t even remember the last time I went to the beach,\u201d Jimin says, slowing down once they reach a particularly flat and smooth area that looks good for sitting. Jungkook plops down on the sand, then offers up a strong hand to Jimin, which Jimin uses to help him ease himself down next to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMe neither,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cIt\u2019s been forever since I left the city at all. I always feel bad when I take time off work, so I haven\u2019t been on a proper trip in ages.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s why you were so excited to come with me, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOne of the reasons,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding. \u201cMy team is really small, so if I take time off, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone there to do my job. The work just piles up until I get back. So that makes it hard to relax while I\u2019m away. Since this was only a few days, I figured it would be okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s important to take time off, though,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cBut I understand how you feel\u2014I\u2019m Namjoon\u2019s only assistant, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone else there doing my job whenever I\u2019m gone. Namjoon always stresses how important it is for me to take a break sometimes, though, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel less bad about it when I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI wish my boss was like that. Namjoon seems really great.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe is,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cMaybe you should look for another job? You deserve to be able to take a vacation without your boss making you feel bad. You\u2019ll burn out, otherwise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook says. He sounds hesitant. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it. About switching careers entirely, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin asks, surprised. \u201cWhat would you do instead?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing sadly. \u201cThere are lots of things I like doing, but I don\u2019t know how to turn any of them into a career. Development is all I\u2019ve ever known how to do. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy it\u2014it pays well, and I\u2019m good at it. But it doesn\u2019t feel completely fulfilling sometimes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere has to be meaning behind it,\u201d Jimin murmurs. \u201cI get that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you feel that way about your job? Like it has meaning?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin nods. \u201cYeah. For me, I think my primary motivation has always been to help people. Not only in my career, but, like\u2014in life, in general. And I know Namjoon is only one person, but my job pretty much consists of helping him in one million different ways, so it is fulfilling for me. Especially because I think he\u2019s a really good human. It feels meaningful to help him. He helps a lot of other people in return.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI noticed that about you,\u201d Jungkook murmurs. His gaze is fixed on the ocean in front of them, hair blowing softly in the warm breeze. \u201cThe night we met, you were so hellbent on repaying me for helping you. Like you couldn\u2019t accept the help without feeling like you needed to offer help in return.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess I\u2019m\u2026\u201d Jimin trails off. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not used to being the one who\u2019s helped. Usually it\u2019s me who\u2019s doing the helping.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook hums. \u201cThat sounds like it might be a little exhausting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin breathes out, nodding. \u201cIt is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s tiring when you give and give and don\u2019t get anything back,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, too. It sucks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin leans backward until he\u2019s lying flat on the sand, staring up at the starry black sky above them. A moment later, Jungkook lies down too. There\u2019s about a foot of space between them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI feel like\u2014um. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but I don\u2019t feel that way with you,\u201d Jimin mumbles. \u201cI worry a lot about whether I\u2019m doing everything I should be, about whether everyone has everything they need\u2014like, what I should be doing for people. But with you, I feel like I can just\u2026 <em>be</em>? Like I can relax and put my guard down and actually have fun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook turns his head to look at him. \u201cGood. That makes me happy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want you to come on this trip as a form of repayment for helping me, but\u2026 that wasn\u2019t the only reason. I really, legitimately have fun with you. I wouldn\u2019t have brought you if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles. \u201cI have fun with you, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin meets his eye for a long moment, then glances away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou promise you\u2019ve been having fun?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Jungkook says, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m having a great time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, good. What do you want to do tomorrow night? It\u2019s our last night here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook is quiet for a few seconds, thinking. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me. We can do whatever you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe we can go to the bar,\u201d Jimin suggests. \u201cI kind of wanted to have at least one night out while we were here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis doesn\u2019t count?\u201d Jungkook teases.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNah. We had everybody watching us tonight. Tomorrow night, it can just be us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says. He rolls over onto his side a little, facing Jimin. \u201cAfter we go back home, we\u2019ll still hang out, right? You weren\u2019t just saying that to ease the sting of breaking up with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin turns his head to look at him. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll still hang out. And for the record, I didn\u2019t break up with you. That would require us to be together in the first place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou kind of did,\u201d Jungkook says, pouting. \u201cYou fake broke up with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just thought you deserved to know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat my services were no longer needed?\u201d Jungkook sighs deeply. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have employed me for a bit longer? I like feeling useful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s stomach does a nervous flip. He\u2019s not sure if Jungkook is just being silly and flirty like he always is, or if he\u2019s trying to imply something more.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt had nothing to do with your performance. Your performance was excellent,\u201d Jimin assures him, reaching out to pat his hand.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSeokjin is going to be so disappointed when I tell him I don\u2019t need his acting lessons anymore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin bursts out laughing. \u201cHe was giving you acting lessons?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAgainst my will, yes. Usually he\u2019d corner me while I was in the shower and had nowhere else to go. I would cower behind the shower curtain while he yelled at me about Stanislavski's method.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe and Hoseok are such a surprising couple. Hoseok seems so chill and easygoing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s why they work, though. Seokjin is a <em>lot</em>, but Hobi is the perfect person to handle him. He\u2019s go-with-the-flow enough that he\u2019s never bothered by Seokjin\u2019s antics at all. He mainly finds the craziness entertaining, I think.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt seemed like he didn\u2019t like me,\u201d Jimin says, smiling softly and glancing over at Jungkook. \u201cSeokjin, I mean. I think that\u2019s why I find him so intimidating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shakes his head. \u201cNo, he likes you. He wouldn\u2019t have been giving me acting lessons if he didn\u2019t like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut he was so scary.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about you. He was just worried about me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, before we left for the bar, I was ranting to him about how I was swearing off dating forever. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to flirt with anybody, or dance with anybody, or\u2026 yeah. So he was obviously very confused when he saw us together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d Jimin asks, eyebrows furrowing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, it\u2019s kind of what I explained already.\u201d Jungkook blinks up at the sky, thinking for a moment, digging his toes into the sand. \u201cI had started talking to this guy\u2014nothing serious, we hadn\u2019t even gone on our first date yet\u2014but it turned out he was really only interested in hooking up. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with hooking up, but\u2026 I want more than that. And it seems like all the guys I meet only want me for my body. They don\u2019t care about <em>me</em>. You know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin rolls over to face Jungkook, resting his head on his hand, frowning. \u201cThere is a lot more to you than your body.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles a sad half-smile. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s very\u2014well. You know. It\u2019s... a nice body.\u201d Jimin clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cBut what\u2019s up here is also nice.\u201d He leans over, gently poking Jungkook\u2019s temple with his pointer finger. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you said to Hyungsik that night at the gala. You <em>do</em> have many redeeming qualities.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLike what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou are very funny. You make me laugh so much. You\u2019re so easy to get along with. You\u2019re sweet and not at all threatening, unlike a lot of guys. You\u2019re generous, and kind, and you seem very reliable. And you\u2019re so smart.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, you can stop,\u201d Jungkook says, running his hands over his face, embarrassed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFine. Now it\u2019s your turn to flatter me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook says, sighing. \u201cWe\u2019d be here all night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s heart does an obnoxious topsy-turvy thing. He rolls over onto his back again. \u201cWe have plenty of time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles. \u201cIf you insist. Um\u2026 well, you\u2019re really fun. Like, seriously, <em>so</em> fun. You\u2019re also super thoughtful, and you genuinely care about other people in a way I think is kind of rare. You\u2019re very passionate, and energetic, and\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe this part, but you\u2019re really genuine? I\u2019ve always felt like I could trust you, even before I knew you well. Honestly, I like everything about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says, breathing in. He can feel his cheeks flushing. \u201cThanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s nose scrunches a little. \u201cYou know, when you chose me at the bar that night, I assumed it was because of how I looked. I figured you were just going to be like everyone else. You\u2019re not, though\u2014not at all.\u201d Jungkook goes quiet.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cActually, I had only seen you from the back,\u201d Jimin says, laughing. He wipes off the sand stuck to his hand, then brushes some hair out of his eyes. \u201cI had no idea what you were going to look like when you turned around. I literally just turned and grabbed the closest person. It just happened to be you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat was lucky,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I met you, Jimin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m really glad I met you, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span>\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\">\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGod, it\u2019s hot today,\u201d Jimin groans, shading his eyes from the sun as they make their way down the brick path to the hotel spa, which is all the way on the other side of the resort. Seagulls fly above them in the cloudless sky overhead. There\u2019s no breeze to offer any respite from the heat, which is already suffocating.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRight? It\u2019s barely past ten,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cIt\u2019s so humid, too. I wonder how hot it\u2019s going to get by the afternoon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt least this is an air-conditioned activity. Maybe we should spend the rest of the day in the pool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook nods. \u201cOr we can start your bar crawl early.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have that kind of stamina anymore,\u201d Jimin says, sighing. \u201cMy youth is so far behind me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin. You\u2019re 26.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet your stamina is more than adequate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is mid-sip, drinking the last of the iced americano he\u2019d picked up earlier that morning, and he nearly chokes. He plays it off, keeping a straight face as he sucks down the rest of his coffee, slurping at the bottom.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They arrive at the spa, which is a small white building nestled back among some giant bushes dotted with bright pink flowers. The air conditioning is so strong that goosebumps rise on Jimin\u2019s arms when they walk in. Inside, there\u2019s a welcome desk and a waiting area, and a young woman with dyed blonde hair is sitting behind the counter.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi there,\u201d she says, smiling politely. \u201cWelcome to our spa. Do you have an appointment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe do,\u201d Jimin tells her. \u201cWe have a couple\u2019s massage at 10:30.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh! How lovely,\u201d she says, clapping her hands together. She glances back and forth between the two of them. \u201cOur couple\u2019s massage is very romantic and sensual. Trust me, you won\u2019t regret setting aside time for this. Everyone raves about it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cVery romantic and sensual,\u201d Jimin repeats, his voice flat. \u201cGreat. Perfect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook slides his arm around Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cIt was his idea to book the appointment,\u201d Jungkook lies, surely just to fluster Jimin, which seems to be one of his favorite pastimes. \u201cHe\u2019s a big romantic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">She practically coos, batting her eyelashes at Jimin. \u201cAh, that\u2019s so sweet! Aren\u2019t you lucky. Well, you gentlemen can follow me, if you\u2019re ready.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They follow her down a narrow hallway, then into a large treatment room, where two massage tables have been placed side-by-side, a couple of feet apart. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing: there are no windows, and the walls and floor are made of dark panelled wood, with a slow and soothing instrumental track playing softly over the speakers. There\u2019s a tiny waterfall fountain built into one wall, water trickling down quietly over the rocks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease take off your shoes,\u201d the woman says, pointing to a mat by the door. \u201cMake yourself comfortable, then go ahead and get completely undressed. In about five minutes, I\u2019ll send in your massage therapists.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCom\u2014completely?\u201d Jimin squeaks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes. This is a full-body massage, so you\u2019ll need to be completely undressed,\u201d the woman explains. \u201cHave you had a massage before?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin shakes his head. Jungkook glances at him in surprise.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh,\u201d she says, understanding. \u201cI can see how that might be alarming if you weren\u2019t expecting it! Don\u2019t worry. Our massage therapists are professionals, and they\u2019ve seen it all before. Besides, I\u2019m sure <em>he</em> has too, right?\u201d She looks over at Jungkook, winking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook looks like he\u2019s two seconds away from dissolving into laughter. The corners of his mouth twitch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin laughs weakly. \u201cHe sure has! Yes. Many times. Ha-ha.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cEnjoy your massage,\u201d the woman says, smiling. She leaves the room, the heavy door closing behind her with a solid <em>thunk. </em>Jimin feels like he\u2019s just been locked inside a death chamber.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Did you know we were going to have to get naked?</em>\u201d Jimin hisses at Jungkook in a loud whisper, eyes rapidly scanning the room, looking for <em>something</em>\u2014a robe, a towel, anything at all to cover himself. There\u2019s nothing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI mean, I kind of assumed,\u201d Jungkook admits. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for a massage. But I thought you knew that! You didn\u2019t tell me you had never had one before! So I assumed you were okay with it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI had no idea. I figured we would just have to take our shirts off or something!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLook, it\u2019s really not a big deal. They give you a sheet to cover your butt, and they only take it off when they need to massage that part. See?\u201d Jungkook points at the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin glances over. Calling it a sheet is a sweeping exaggeration. It is merely a scrap of cloth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t even think that\u2019s big enough to cover my ass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, I mean, your\u2026 um. You know what\u2014no comment, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re on a countdown here,\u201d Jimin reminds him. \u201cWe have five minutes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI\u2019ll turn around, if you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, please. Wait, shouldn\u2019t we <em>both</em> turn around?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shrugs. \u201cYou can do whatever you want. I just want you to be comfortable.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll turn around!\u201d Jimin huffs, walking over to the table on the right and turning his back to Jungkook. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to\u2014why would I\u2014I\u2019ll turn around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing a little. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m turned around now, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin takes a deep breath. He starts to unbutton his shirt very slowly. Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem to need as much time to work up to it. Jimin hears the sound of his shirt rustling and being pulled over his head, then a few footsteps as he steps out of his shorts. And underwear. Presumably.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin slides his shirt off his shoulders, folding it on the table next to him. Then he reaches down to the waistband of his shorts, hesitating for a moment before pulling them down.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s daydreamed a lot about what it would be like to get naked with Jungkook for the first time, and while the mental scenarios have been adventurous and highly creative, he definitely did not anticipate it would happen like <em>this</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He folds up his shorts and underwear and carefully places them on top of his shirt. The room feels a little hot. He is as nude as the day he was born.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jungkook asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo!\u201d Jimin yelps. \u201cHold on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m still turned around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll get on the table first,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cAnd then you can turn around, once I\u2019m under the sheet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is so panicked, it\u2019s only as he turns to climb onto the table that he remembers turning around will give him an up-close-and-personal view of Jungkook\u2019s ass. But by the time he realizes, it\u2019s too late\u2014he\u2019s already seen it all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And Jungkook is, indeed, still turned around. That much is true. He\u2019s got his hands on his hips, he is <em>very</em> naked, and he has one of the best butts Jimin has ever had the privilege of witnessing in real life.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin slaps a hand over his eyes, letting out a noise that\u2019s somewhere between a whimper and a wheeze.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He lies face down on the table, reaching behind himself awkwardly to pull the sheet over his bottom half. He adjusts it nervously for a moment, then lets out a breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. You can turn around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hears the sound of the table next to him creaking under Jungkook\u2019s weight as he climbs on top of it. \u201cDid you look at me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin croaks out. \u201cNo! Well, I mean\u2014yes, but\u2026 accidentally! Passively!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm,\u201d Jungkook says, a little muffled now, presumably because he\u2019s now facedown on the table as well. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not interesting at all!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat isn\u2019t? My butt, or the fact that you looked?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The door opens. Jimin is so startled that he nearly falls off the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHello,\u201d a friendly female voice calls. \u201cI\u2019m Iseul, and this is Nabi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi there,\u201d another voice chimes in.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be your massage therapists today. Are you ready to begin?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook tells them, which is helpful, because Jimin is still too tongue-tied to form words at the moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is a full-body massage, which means we\u2019ll massage your neck and shoulders, your back, glutes, thighs, calves, all the way down to your feet. Is there anywhere you want us to avoid today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Although this is admittedly a foreign experience, the thought of having his muscles worked from head to toe actually sounds <em>amazing</em> to Jimin. Especially now, considering he is terribly stressed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, that\u2019s all good,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSame,\u201d Jungkook says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a brief moment of silence while both therapists squirt some warmed massage oil onto their hands, then they start working it into Jungkook and Jimin\u2019s shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Jimin practically groans. \u201cThat feels amazing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs this your first massage?\u201d the woman massaging him asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYup. Can you tell?\u201d Jimin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re very tense,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI knew it had to be your first, or you hadn\u2019t had one in a long time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Of course I\u2019m tense</em>, Jimin thinks. <em>I am naked and Jungkook is also naked and he is very close to me while we are both naked, and also, I saw his butt.\u00a0</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAm I tense?\u201d Jungkook asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot at all,\u201d his massage therapist says. \u201cYour muscles are loose and relaxed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s eyes roll under the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you two enjoying your stay here so far?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cWe\u2019re here on a company trip. Well, I am. Jungkook came as my plus one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow nice,\u201d Jimin\u2019s therapist says. \u201cHow long have you two been together?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA year,\u201d Jungkook says immediately, long before Jimin even has a chance to try to mentally calculate how long they have been fake boyfriending.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow,\u201d she says, thumbs pressing into the back of Jimin\u2019s neck. He groans a little. \u201cGood for you. How did you meet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Please don\u2019t say it was at a sex shop</em>, Jimin attempts to silently and telepathically communicate to Jungkook.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt the zoo,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI was looking at the tigers. As it turns out, Jimin loves tigers. We struck up a two-hour-long conversation about tigers. The rest is history, as they say.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin truly has no idea how Jungkook comes up with this shit.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs that why you have a tiger tattooed on your arm?\u201d the woman massaging Jungkook asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook says wistfully. \u201cI got it right after we met, because I knew he was the one. It\u2019s a symbol of our love.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s so romantic!\u201d Jimin\u2019s therapist sounds like she is swooning a little. \u201cWhat a beautiful gesture.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was the least I could do. Jimin is truly my entire world.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin does his best to choke back a laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat about your tattoos?\u201d Jimin\u2019s therapist asks him. \u201cAre any of yours dedicated to him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Jimin lies. \u201cOn my wrist\u2026 the 13th of June is the day we met.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, wow,\u201d the woman massaging Jungkook says. \u201cYou two are so romantic! You must be so in love!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>I had literally never seen his butt until today</em>, Jimin thinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are,\u201d Jungkook says, sighing. \u201cCan you go over that spot a little harder, please?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The rest of the 60-minute massage passes by relatively quickly, and Jimin\u2019s hard-earned tension is eventually worked away by his massage therapist\u2019s skilled hands. It feels incredible. He almost manages to forget about Jungkook\u2019s butt, but then he has to hear Jungkook groaning when they get to that part of the massage, which fills his mind with so many inappropriate thoughts that he has to imagine all the least sexy scenarios he can think of <em>(Public embarrassment! Cat poop! Horrible accidents! Mass casualties!</em>) in order to avoid popping an incredibly ill-timed boner.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Eventually, once the massage is over, the massage therapists leave the room so that Jungkook and Jimin can get dressed again. Jimin is not sure how he is going to get off the table. He feels like he is made of jelly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I can move,\u201d Jimin mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d Jungkook offers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWait!\u201d Jimin says. \u201cLet me make sure you can\u2019t see my ass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He reaches around, feeling to make sure the sheet is in place. His arm wobbles a little.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. Tell me when you\u2019re dressed,\u201d Jimin says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hears Jungkook hop off the table, then tries his very hardest to not think about the fact that Jungkook is still naked. You would think he\u2019d have to have accepted this fact sometime over the past hour, but apparently not. Visions of Jungkook\u2019s butt are still swimming behind Jimin\u2019s eyelids, unrelenting.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s the sound of clothes rustling, and a minute later, Jungkook says \u201cOkay, I\u2019m dressed. Want me to turn around?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes? Of course I want you to turn around,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cDid you think you were going to get a free show?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s cheeks flush. \u201cTurn around, you little perv.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook bursts out laughing. \u201cHey, you looked at <em>my</em> butt. What does that make you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA victim,\u201d Jimin says flatly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. Sure,\u201d Jungkook says. Jimin can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cSeems like you did it on purpose, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo. If I wanted to see your butt on purpose, I would ask you directly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pauses. \u201cWould you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin blinks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\n<em>No, I guess I wouldn\u2019t.</em>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d Jimin declares loudly, pushing himself up on his arms. He glances over at Jungkook, who has turned to face the wall. \u201cStay turned around. I\u2019m gonna get dressed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">After his clothes are back on, he walks over and taps Jungkook on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I hope you thoroughly enjoyed this hour of unexpected exhibitionism.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI did, actually,\u201d Jungkook says brightly, following Jimin out of the room.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span>\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou did <em>what</em>?\u201d Jimin asks, bursting into laughter so violently he almost topples over onto the brick path underfoot. He grabs at Jungkook\u2019s arm to steady himself. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNope,\u201d Jungkook says, tongue poking at the inside of his cheek. \u201cAnd it worked, too. I never heard them again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s just told Jimin another Seokjin story\u2014there seem to be an endless number of them. Apparently when Seokjin first started dating Hoseok, they were getting it on so loudly that it was keeping Jungkook awake at night. When Jungkook decided he had had enough, he plugged in his keyboard at full volume and started playing the theme song to every cartoon he could think of. As well as his five-year-old-equivalent skill level would allow, anyway\u2014which is to say, not very well.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Seokjin eventually burst in, yelling over the music, demanding to know why Jungkook was ruining the ambiance. Jungkook told him that was exactly the point, and then he threatened to play the Spongebob theme song on repeat any time he was able to hear them through the wall after midnight.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDoes it have to be Spongebob?\u201d Seokjin had exclaimed, face flushed with exertion.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook had said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And that was the end of that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWow,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cAnd yet he still loves you so much.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe does,\u201d Jungkook confirms, wiping a little sweat off his brow. The day\u2019s heat hasn\u2019t subsided at all, despite the sun setting over an hour ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I can cook.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou can cook?\u201d Jimin asks, eyes widening. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. When we get back, will you cook for me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles at him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll cook for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019re walking back to their room together, a little bit tipsy after wrapping up their resort bar crawl. After their massage, they\u2019d spent the day trying to stay cool in the pool, but eventually gave up and decided to retreat to the relief of air conditioning instead. They ate an early dinner, then bounced from bar to bar until the sun went down. They only had one drink at each, though, so they\u2019re really not <em>that</em> drunk, especially considering the way they both manage to hold their liquor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook opens the door to the building and gestures for Jimin to go in first. He does, then glances back at Jungkook with a quizzical look on his face as they walk down the hallway. \u201cWhy does it feel so hot in here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI dunno. Maybe we\u2019re just overheated,\u201d Jungkook says with a shrug.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They reach the door to their room and Jimin unlocks it. They open the door, and when they walk in, an oppressive wall of hot, stale air hits them right in the face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t right,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sauna in here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid we accidentally turn off the AC?\u201d Jungkook asks, slipping off his shoes and walking over to the thermostat. He taps on the screen, frowning. \u201cIt says it\u2019s on\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet me call the front desk,\u201d Jimin says, sitting down on the bed next to the table with the room phone. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to fall asleep if it\u2019s this hot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He picks up the phone, pressing the button to reach the front desk. It rings a few times, then a friendly female voice answers. \u201cHello?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi there. We\u2019re in room 186, and we seem to be having some trouble with our air conditioner? It says it\u2019s on, but the room is very hot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, yes, is that one of the swim-up suites? Unfortunately, we've been experiencing some problems with the AC in that building since this afternoon. I believe we have a technician on site now investigating the problem, but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have an estimate on how long it might take until it\u2019s fixed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you think it will be tonight?\u201d Jimin asks. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, <em>very</em> hot in here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, I expect it will be sometime later this evening. I\u2019m just not able to give you an exact ETA.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. Thank you,\u201d Jimin says, sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Please accept my deepest apologies for the inconvenience. Do give us a call if you need anything at all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI will, thank you. Bye.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hangs up the phone, then turns to Jungkook. \u201cThe AC\u2019s busted in the whole building, apparently. She said it should hopefully be fixed tonight, but she\u2019s not sure exactly when.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook already looks a little damp. His face is glistening. He dabs at his forehead with his hand. \u201cWhat are we gonna do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin hums. \u201cMaybe we should hang out in our pool? That\u2019ll probably be the coolest option... unless we want to go out again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m too sleepy to go back out,\u201d Jungkook says, shaking his head. \u201cThe pool is a good idea, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They get changed into their swim shorts\u2014a much less awkward routine, now that they\u2019ve had a few days\u2019 worth of practice\u2014then grab two towels from the bathroom to use to dry off when they get out of the pool. Jungkook is wearing his navy swim trunks, the ones that show off his thigh tattoo a little bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin follows Jungkook outside, towel slung over his shoulder.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt literally feels the same out here as inside the room,\u201d Jimin says, whining. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. Except there\u2019s a little breeze, so if anything, it\u2019s better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be fixed by the time we go back in,\u201d Jungkook says. He sets his towel on the ground, then steps down the stairs leading into the pool, wading into the water. The pool is glowing fluorescent blue in the dark, the rippling water reflecting in waves of light across Jungkook\u2019s body. \u201cOh, this is much better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin steps down into the pool, and the water is pleasantly cool against his bare skin, a welcome respite from the heat. It\u2019s not chilly enough that he needs any time to let his body adjust before dunking himself in all the way, so he immediately disappears under the water, seeking its cool relief. He reappears after a moment, running both hands through his wet hair to push it back off his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis <em>is</em> much better,\u201d Jimin agrees, wading over to the other side of the pool. He leans back against the wall, supporting his weight with his arms. Water drips from his hair down his neck, and the breeze tickles it, cool and comforting.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook grabs the foam raft that\u2019s floating off to one side of the pool, then pulls himself halfway onto it, so that his chin is resting on his crossed arms and he\u2019s able to kick his feet a little.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess there could be worse ways for us to pass the time,\u201d Jungkook says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMm-hmm. Many.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat time is our flight home tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s at 2:30,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cCheckout is at noon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re already leaving. It feels like we just got here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin agrees. He sinks down a little deeper into the water. \u201cIt went by really fast.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m sad. I will miss our private pool and hot tub.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin sticks out his tongue a little. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jungkook asks, tilting his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you going to miss me, too?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pulls himself up a bit further onto the raft. \u201cThat depends. Am I going to have to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles. \u201cOnly if you want to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMissing someone,\u201d Jungkook says, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether or not you want to. When you miss somebody, you feel it with your whole body. Maybe you can try telling your heart that you don\u2019t want to feel it anymore, but it doesn\u2019t usually listen. You\u2019re just along for the ride until it ends.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow does it end?\u201d Jimin asks quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, it ends when you don\u2019t miss them anymore. Either because they\u2019re there, so you don\u2019t have to anymore, or because your heart finally realized there was no point. That it was never going to end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t want you to miss me,\u201d Jimin says. The pool water laps at his shoulders, tiny ripples sent his way by Jungkook\u2019s slow, stationary kicking.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook laughs softly, although Jimin isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s funny. \u201cJimin, honestly, I feel like I miss you even when I\u2019m looking right at you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s stomach flutters. \u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think it\u2019s the anticipation,\u201d Jungkook says, glancing away. \u201cOf knowing that I will, later on. Eventually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you mean don\u2019t? I already told you that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou also told me that your heart will stop doing the missing once it doesn\u2019t have to anymore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re very confusing, you know that?\u201d Jungkook says, pushing himself off the raft, back onto the balls of his feet at the bottom of the pool. \u201cLast night, you broke up with me, and now you\u2019re telling me I won\u2019t have to miss you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI didn\u2019t break up with you,\u201d Jimin says with a sigh. \u201cWe went over this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe not, but it felt like you did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought it was what you\u2019d want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid you ever consider <em>asking</em> me what I want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The pool raft floats between them. Jungkook is staring Jimin straight in the eye, something flickering in his gaze that Jimin doesn\u2019t recognize. It\u2019s not anger\u2014his face is soft, his brows upturned.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d Jimin swallows. \u201cI guess I thought I already knew.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMaybe you should ask me, then, and see if you\u2019re right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pushes the raft aside, taking a few steps toward Jimin. Jimin has nowhere to go\u2014his back is already pressed against the wall of the pool.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAsk you\u2026\u201d Jimin trails off, his chest rising and falling visibly. \u201cAsk you what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook draws closer, right up into Jimin\u2019s space. He plants one arm on either side of Jimin, gripping the edge of the pool, caging him in. He\u2019s so close that Jimin can see the water droplets clinging to his eyelashes, reflecting the blue water like tiny crystals.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAsk me what I want.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice is soft, more velvety than Jimin has ever heard it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s heart speeds up, beating frantically against his ribcage.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin tilts his chin up, looking Jungkook in the eye. Trying to seem braver than he feels.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jimin asks quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook doesn\u2019t answer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Instead, he leans in, pressing his mouth to Jimin\u2019s in a kiss so unexpectedly heated that Jimin\u2019s knees nearly give out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His mouth is warm and soft, and he\u2019s surrounding Jimin from every side, his arms slick with pool water under the moonlight. He tastes like salt and chlorine and everything Jimin has ever wanted.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Jimin manages to gasp after a moment, his arms coming up to clutch at Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. Jungkook pulls away, just enough to let him speak, their noses brushing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook, there\u2019s no one here to see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s breath is shaky, irregular. \u201cSo then you weren\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJimin, tell me if this is what you want. I can never tell what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Jungkook says quietly. His eyes are dark and vulnerable, reflecting the glowing light of the pool.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, I want you,\u201d Jimin breathes, one hand moving up to tangle in Jungkook\u2019s wet hair. Jungkook pushes all the way forward, his chest pressing against Jimin\u2019s body. The edge of the pool digs into Jimin\u2019s back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThen let me kiss you when no one is looking,\u201d Jungkook murmurs.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So Jimin lets him. It\u2019s frantic and heated, a blur of hands everywhere all at once, all their clandestine feelings finally flooding out into the open for anyone to see. Their quiet gasps, the nip and pull of Jungkook\u2019s bottom lip between Jimin\u2019s teeth, Jungkook\u2019s broad hands sliding up Jimin\u2019s stomach\u2014this is the most honest they have ever been with each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGod, ever since I met you, this is all I\u2019ve been able to think about,\u201d Jungkook breathes, his voice a little labored. His fingertips press into Jimin\u2019s back, supporting his weight. Jimin is grateful to be pushed up against the wall, because otherwise he would probably be at actual risk of falling over.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d Jimin trails off, groaning softly as Jungkook\u2019s mouth trails down his neck and across his shoulder. \u201cYou told me you were really picky, so I thought that was your way of telling me\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI <em>am</em> picky,\u201d Jungkook says, lips brushing against Jimin\u2019s skin as he speaks. \u201cAnd I am picking you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says weakly, eyes fluttering closed as Jungkook\u2019s tongue makes contact with his collarbone. \u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou told me you had sworn off men,\u201d Jungkook complains. Jimin is so consumed by the heat of him, the weight of him, that he can barely process the words. He wiggles against him, seeking some friction. \u201cI am a man. I thought I was included.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have decided to make an exception,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cBut only if you stop talking and kiss me again, please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles. He cups Jimin\u2019s face with both hands, wet thumbs brushing over his cheeks. \u201cOnly because you asked so nicely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin is already kissing him before he can finish saying it, swallowing down the rest of the words with his eager mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Any time they\u2019d kissed before this, Jimin always had to hold back a little. No tongue in front of coworkers\u2014no allowing himself to get actually, <em>legitimately</em> turned on\u2014no crossing the blurry lines they\u2019d tried to establish between themselves. More than anything, he was trying to protect himself emotionally. If he kept telling himself it was fake, he was less likely to get hurt.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Now, though, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about any of that. Although it hasn\u2019t quite sunk into his shell-shocked, lust-addled brain, he\u2019s now armed with a thrilling and terrifying piece of information: <em>Jungkook wants him</em>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And that confirmation sets Jimin free. He can finally act on all the pent-up hunger that he\u2019s been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to ignore. He can be selfish. He can act how he feels: needy and demanding and brazen. He can touch everything that he\u2019s been dying to touch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His hands greedily explore wet, smooth skin: Jungkook\u2019s arms, shoulders, chest, stomach. The way Jungkook\u2019s muscles clench under his hands sends a jolt of desire straight down through his belly. He lets his hands trail down to Jungkook\u2019s ass, which hasn\u2019t left his mind since they had their massage earlier that day. He squeezes a little, testing Jungkook\u2019s reaction.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Then he uses his grip on Jungkook\u2019s butt to pull him in, dragging him forward until their hips collide. Jungkook is already so hard that Jimin can feel the distinct shape of his cock pressed up against him under the water. Jimin shifts his weight, slotting one thigh slightly between Jungkook\u2019s legs, a better angle for him, then shifts his hips, grinding against him. Jungkook makes a tiny strangled noise, then drops his head onto Jimin\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck, you\u2019re so hot,\u201d Jimin breathes, hands skimming along the waistband of Jungkook\u2019s shorts. \u201cI\u2019ve been going crazy over you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI really didn\u2019t know,\u201d Jungkook says quietly, inhaling sharply as Jimin presses against him again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you. Can I touch you?\u201d Jimin murmurs, hand trailing lower.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cOut here? I mean\u2014yes, I want you to, but\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Underwater, Jimin palms him through the thin material of his swim trunks, and Jungkook groans, head lolling forward again.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, maybe just a little,\u201d Jungkook gasps. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so sensitive, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The rest of that thought is cut off when Jimin reaches down the front of Jungkook\u2019s shorts and wraps his hand around his cock under the water. There\u2019s barely enough space between their bodies for Jimin to have any room to maneuver, but he starts to jerk him off slowly, using his other hand to grab Jungkook\u2019s hair and gently pull his head back off of Jimin\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI want you to look at me,\u201d Jimin murmurs, using his grip to tilt Jungkook\u2019s head back until he\u2019s looking him in the eyes. \u201cWhile I touch you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s chest is starting to flush pink. He stares back at Jimin, chest heaving, lips parted, water dripping down his neck. Jimin tightens his grip on Jungkook\u2019s cock, slowing down his strokes, and the noise Jungkook lets out in response is obscene.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou are so stupidly, unbelievably hot,\u201d Jimin tells him. \u201cBut you also need to be quiet. Someone might hear us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan\u2019t be quiet,\u201d Jungkook says, shaking his head. He\u2019s nearly pouting. \u201cDidn\u2019t wait so long for this only to have to be quiet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThen we\u2019ll save this for later,\u201d Jimin says, removing his hand from Jungkook\u2019s shorts. Jungkook lets out a tiny whine.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin loops his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck and wraps his legs around his waist, hoisting himself up, letting himself be carried by the buoyancy of the water. Jungkook doesn\u2019t even need to support his weight.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It puts him at the perfect angle to feel Jungkook\u2019s hardness right against his own. He rolls his hips in a slow circle, eyelashes fluttering closed at the delicious friction. It\u2019s too good. He buries his face in Jungkook\u2019s hair, moaning softly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs this supposed to be better?\u201d Jungkook wheezes, hands pressing into Jimin\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me come in my pants if you don\u2019t stop.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm, we can\u2019t have that,\u201d Jimin murmurs into his scalp. \u201cWhen you come, I want it to be inside me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook makes a choked noise. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know if I can survive you. I may have bitten off more than I can chew.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou haven\u2019t bitten me at all, yet, actually. Maybe you can do that once we get inside.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s go inside, then. You want me to fuck you?\u201d Jungkook breathes, looking up at him. His cheeks are flushed, his eyes dark, wavy strands of wet hair clinging to his forehead. Jimin brushes some hair back off his face, running his hand through it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. Please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook starts to walk them back across the pool, over to the stairs, moving easily through the water. Jimin expects him to struggle once he starts walking up the steps, losing the buoyancy that was keeping Jimin afloat, but he climbs them easily, arms under Jimin\u2019s thighs to help support his weight. Water drips off them both, running down onto the tile in rivulets, soaked shorts clinging to their bodies.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShould we dry off first?\u201d Jimin asks, eyeing the towels sitting on the ground by the door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNope,\u201d Jungkook says brightly, using one hand to slide open the door. \u201cThat would take too long.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin giggles into his hair, holding on tightly as Jungkook closes the door behind them. He takes a few steps toward the bed, and he\u2019s about to drop Jimin down onto the mattress, but Jimin clings to him tighter, yelping. \u201cWait!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook asks, looking up at him with concern, gripping his thighs again.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to get the bed all wet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. You\u2019re right. Hmm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust fuck me on the floor,\u201d Jimin whines.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Jungkook asks, laughing. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m cool with that if you are. I would fuck you anywhere.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLess talking about fucking me and more actual fucking me, please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo demanding,\u201d Jungkook teases, pivoting and walking over to the closet, Jimin still in tow. He uses one arm to open up the closet door, then grabs one of the extra blankets that\u2019s folded up on the top shelf.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI believe you\u2019ve said that about me before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, I have. My opinion hasn\u2019t changed. Hold on tight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin clings onto him as he shakes out the blanket, laying it out on the floor next to the bed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know, this would probably be easier if you just put me down,\u201d Jimin says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to put me down before I can get down there, anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNope.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin raises an eyebrow at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook lowers himself down carefully, bending at the knees, then easing onto his calves. It doesn\u2019t seem like it requires any effort at all. Jimin fleetingly wonders how much he can deadlift. Once he\u2019s seated on his knees, he leans forward, gently lying Jimin down on the blanket. Jimin stares up at him, starry-eyed. Tiny droplets of water drip off Jungkook\u2019s hair, landing on Jimin\u2019s cheeks, and Jimin scrunches his eyes shut, laughing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi,\u201d Jungkook breathes, sinking down on top of him, their noses bumping.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHi, cutie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPet names already? I don\u2019t know if my heart can take it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be so cute, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere is a small problem,\u201d Jungkook admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring condoms with me. I didn\u2019t want you to think I was, like\u2026 a predator.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin closes his eyes and silently thanks Taehyung.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have some. It\u2019s a long story. Taehyung packed them in my bag.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook bursts out laughing. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s just say he was rooting for you. Wanna get them? There should be lube, too. They\u2019re in the inside pocket on the left side.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Jungkook says solemnly, climbing off him and walking over to his suitcase in the corner.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it. Not after you deposited me with such care.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you want a pillow?\u201d Jungkook asks, rummaging through the suitcase.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo. I want you to fuck me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, I get it,\u201d Jungkook says, laughing. He eventually locates the lube and condoms, then pads back over to the blanket with wet feet, leaving small puddles in his wake. His swim trunks are obnoxiously tented at the front.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He climbs back on top of Jimin, setting the goods off to the side. \u201cYou want my fingers first?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s dick twitches instinctively. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, pressing a kiss to the side of Jimin\u2019s head. It\u2019s the beginning of\u00a0 a trail down: across his jaw, down his neck, down the center of his chest. He kisses each individual letter of Jimin\u2019s tattoo. Jimin starts squirming\u2014he\u2019s so hard that he\u2019s starting to hurt a little bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook reaches Jimin\u2019s stomach, and he kisses right above the waistband of his shorts, underneath his belly button.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook. Wait,\u201d Jimin says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHmm?\u201d Jungkook asks, thumbs rubbing tiny circles into Jimin\u2019s hip bones.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know I don\u2019t do one night stands,\u201d Jimin says quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook smiles up at him. \u201cTrust me, Jimin, this definitely won\u2019t be a one night stand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh. Okay,\u201d Jimin breathes. \u201cTake them off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pulls down his swim trunks, not without a bit of effort, as the wet fabric clings to Jimin\u2019s thighs all the way down. His cock springs out, red and leaking. He truly can\u2019t remember the last time he was this turned on. Jungkook could ask to fuck him with no lube and he would probably agree.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, wrapping a hand around Jimin\u2019s dick and squeezing lightly. Jimin moans, high and cracked, his back arching.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u201d he gasps. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ll come.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid I get you that worked up?\u201d Jungkook says, pressing a kiss into Jimin\u2019s inner thigh. \u201cLet me fix it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He pushes Jimin\u2019s legs apart gently, easing them open. Then he reaches over and grabs the lube, squirting a little bit onto his fingers, taking a moment to warm it up. And then one long, skilled finger is pushing its way into Jimin, slippery and hot.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, <em>fuck</em>,\u201d Jimin whines, spreading his legs further.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs that okay?\u201d Jungkook murmurs, sliding out halfway, then back in. He curls his finger a little, up towards Jimin\u2019s prostate, pressing upwards. Jimin lets out a strangled moan, throwing his arm over his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m going to assume that means it\u2019s okay,\u201d Jungkook says, barely giving Jimin a chance to recover before he\u2019s repeating the motion.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cStop trying to make me <em>come</em>,\u201d Jimin chokes out, dick twitching against his stomach. \u201cJust get me ready. Please. Want you to fuck me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019ve said,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. He eases in another finger slowly, carefully. This one burns a little more, but the stretch isn\u2019t totally unpleasant. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just really hot to watch you like this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know what would be even hotter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Jungkook says, crooking his fingers again. \u201cFucking you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin moans.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook finally manages to stop teasing Jimin long enough to get him thoroughly prepared. By the time he\u2019s worked three fingers in, Jimin is writhing underneath him on the floor, tears forming in the corners of his eyes. He wants Jungkook so badly that he is literally on the verge of tears.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, slipping out of him and sliding back up his body, leaning down to kiss him. \u201cDo you want to stay like this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease,\u201d Jimin begs, half-delirious with want. \u201cWant to see you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, kissing him one more time before pulling back slightly and reaching for the condom. He quickly slides down his shorts, stepping out of them, then rips the condom open, rolling it on hastily. He places both hands on Jimin\u2019s thighs, pushing them back for easier access.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan you hold yourself like that for a minute, baby?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm,\u201d Jimin hazily agrees, reaching down to hold his legs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook lines himself up with Jimin\u2019s entrance, then pushes in slowly. Jimin throws his head back, letting out a gasp. Jungkook is big\u2014not monstrously so, but enough that there\u2019s a burn and stretch as he slides in all the way, grabbing Jimin\u2019s thighs again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck, Jimin,\u201d Jungkook breathes shakily, leaning down closer. \u201cYou\u2019re so tight. Oh my God.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMore, more,\u201d Jimin gasps, hands flying up to tangle in Jungkook\u2019s hair.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook reaches one hand behind Jimin\u2019s head, cradling it in his palm, softening his contact with the hard floor. Then he sinks down, pressing their bodies together, pulling out and sliding back in slowly. It\u2019s warm and wet and Jimin can\u2019t remember the last time he felt anything like this\u2014this overwhelming electricity, this heat coursing through his whole body.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou feel <em>so</em> good,\u201d Jungkook groans, hips stuttering once he\u2019s all the way in. His chest is glistening with sweat, every muscle in his body tensed. \u201cEven\u2014even better than I imagined you would. Ah, fuck, <em>Jimin</em>\u2014\u201d he inhales sharply as Jimin clenches around him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou thought about this,\u201d Jimin says, moaning a little as Jungkook thrusts into him again. He tilts his head back into Jungkook\u2019s hand, staring up at him, lips parted. \u201cAbout fucking me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo much,\u201d Jungkook breathes, picking up the pace a bit. \u201cWanted you so bad. Couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought about you when I\u2014\u201d Jimin gasps as Jungkook adjusts the angle of his hips slightly and hits his prostate head on. \u201cWhen I\u2019d jerk off. Would think about you inside of me. Wanted you so\u2014so fucking bad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook whines, leaning down to bury his face in Jimin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe need to stop talking if you don\u2019t want me to come in, like, five seconds.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou can come whenever you want,\u201d Jimin breathes. \u201cWant you to feel good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWant you to come first,\u201d Jungkook says, still cradling Jimin\u2019s head. \u201cDo you want me to touch you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease, yes\u2014please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook leans down and kisses him, and it\u2019s messy and uncoordinated, but lovely all the same. Jimin sucks on his bottom lip, whining quietly as Jungkook repeatedly hits just the right spot, quickening his thrusts. Jimin wants <em>more</em>, wants to have him inside and out\u2014everywhere he touches, tastes, feels, he wants to find only Jungkook and nothing else.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook reaches down between them and wraps his hand around Jimin\u2019s cock, slick and dripping with precum. He pumps it slowly, working up his speed until he\u2019s moving in sync with his thrusts, and the pleasure is flooding Jimin\u2019s senses, a familiar heat building deep inside him, like a coil winding up tight in his belly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook, <em>oh</em>\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s barely cognizant of the noises he\u2019s making anymore\u2014he\u2019s only thinking about Jungkook\u2019s breath, hot on his shoulder, overwhelmed by the feeling of being filled and stroked simultaneously as Jungkook murmurs quiet praises into his skin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It hits him before he\u2019s expecting it, crashing over his whole body with a jolt, his limbs trembling. He comes with a choked moan, muscles tensing, spilling white all over his stomach and Jungkook\u2019s hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo beautiful like this,\u201d Jungkook pants, hand splayed across Jimin\u2019s stomach. \u201cAh, Jimin\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook keeps fucking him, but he doesn\u2019t last long, egged on by Jimin\u2019s whines, teetering on the edge of overstimulation. He comes loudly, his thrusts turning irregular, Jimin\u2019s name escaping his lips in a guttural moan that Jimin immediately wishes he could hear again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook collapses on top of him, breathing hard.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s suddenly so much quieter.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin wraps both arms around him in a hug, nuzzling his nose against Jungkook\u2019s collarbone. They\u2019re silent for several moments as they let the world fade back in around them, catching their breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re on the floor,\u201d Jungkook eventually says, sounding like he\u2019s only just realizing it now.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are,\u201d Jimin confirms.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat are we, Neanderthals?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin laughs. \u201cYou should be thanking me. Now we don\u2019t have to sleep in a soggy bed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook lifts his head, nudging it upwards until he finds Jimin\u2019s mouth. He kisses him, smiling a little. It\u2019s chaste, but tender.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m so sleepy,\u201d Jungkook mumbles. \u201cIt feels cooler in here too, now, doesn\u2019t it? Maybe the AC started working again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about it,\u201d Jimin says, laughing. \u201cYou are literally still inside of me. I am slightly distracted.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, sorry,\u201d Jungkook says, looking sheepish.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pulls out of him slowly, and Jimin winces at the sudden emptiness.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWanna sleep,\u201d Jungkook says, rolling off Jimin a little. \u201cI\u2019m so tired I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna get up off the floor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m exhausting, I know,\u201d Jimin says with a smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn all the ways I dreamed,\u201d Jungkook tells him, nose scrunching.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe should shower. I need to wash the chlorine out of my hair or it\u2019ll turn green. Also, my come is all over you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook glances down at his stomach. \u201cAh. Right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you wanna shower with me?\u201d Jimin asks. \u201cNo funny business. I don\u2019t have the stamina. It would just mean we can go to sleep quicker.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt some point, I\u2019m going to have to test this theory about your stamina,\u201d Jungkook tells him. \u201cBut not tonight, don\u2019t worry. And yes, I would love to shower with you. But you might have to carry me in there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin brushes some hair out of Jungkook\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think you might be out of luck, then,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re huge.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook bursts out laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not huge. Just\u2026 heavy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re huge compared to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat just means you\u2019ve acquired a new mode of transportation. I can carry you wherever you would like to go. Congratulations.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay. To the shower?\u201d Jimin says brightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI started this conversation questioning how I could carry <em>myself</em> to the shower. I\u2019ll start my job as your new mode of transportation tomorrow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s something about that thought\u2014about having a <em>tomorrow</em> with Jungkook\u2014that makes Jimin\u2019s heart do a tiny flip inside his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin eases himself up off the floor, groaning, then offers an arm to Jungkook to help him up. As he takes Jimin\u2019s hand and stands up, Jimin glances down the length of his body, eyebrows raising.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019d been so distracted while he and Jungkook were fucking that he didn\u2019t even notice it, but with his shorts off, Jungkook\u2019s thigh tattoo is in full view. It\u2019s a floral piece, a black and white arrangement of tiger lilies and peonies. It\u2019s gorgeous. The design perfectly accents the curve of his muscular hip.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYour tattoo is pretty,\u201d Jimin murmurs. He reaches out and brushes a finger across it lightly. \u201cI always wondered what it was. Especially after all your tormenting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you. I was hoping you would get the chance to see.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They head into the bathroom together, and Jimin turns the handle to start running the shower, the bathroom quickly filling with steam as the water heats up. Luckily, the shower stall is more than large enough for two, and they\u2019re able to make quick work of getting washed up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The heated desire that had consumed them earlier has been sated for now\u2014this is all soft and domestic, the way Jimin helps Jungkook wash his hair, the way he runs soapy hands over his stomach to help scrub off the aftermath of their floor aerobics. Jungkook <em>is</em> sleepy, barely able to keep his eyes open once he\u2019s under the hot water. He mostly just stands there and lets Jimin do the work, giving him an occasional forehead kiss as a thank you.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be so tired if you hadn\u2019t spent ten minutes hauling me around to every corner of the bedroom earlier,\u201d Jimin says, laughing as he tips Jungkook\u2019s head back to help rinse out the shampoo. \u201cI told you it was unnecessary.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut I wanna be your mode of transportation,\u201d Jungkook mumbles sleepily, wrapping both arms around Jimin and trapping him in a hug.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, you did tell me that,\u201d Jimin says, smiling against his chest. He rests his cheek there for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re so funny. Also, I can\u2019t believe I am in the shower with you right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can,\u201d Jungkook murmurs against the top of Jimin\u2019s head. \u201cAfter all, I have spent the past three days trying to woo you. I was starting to think my efforts were not going to pay off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin pulls away, blinking up at him. He laughs. \u201cTrust me, Jungkook, you didn\u2019t even have to try.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">After they\u2019ve both gotten all rinsed off, Jimin turns off the shower, then helps Jungkook step out, handing him a clean towel. He ruffles it over his hair, trying to dry it a bit. \u201cI\u2019m going to look like a monster in the morning, going to sleep with my hair like this,\u201d Jungkook warns him. \u201cYou might be scared of me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I will be,\u201d Jimin says, smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The rest of it is calm and quiet and comfortable: they each get dressed in their pajamas, completing their respective pre-bedtime routines, turning off all the lights and crawling into bed. Jimin\u2019s in a clean white t-shirt and gym shorts, and Jungkook is only wearing sweatpants. Jimin has never appreciated a warm, dry, freshly made bed so much before.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSnuggle,\u201d Jungkook demands in the dark, rolling to face Jimin and opening his arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin laughs. \u201cI thought <em>I</em> was supposed to be the demanding one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook pouts.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. Of course I\u2019ll snuggle with you. I\u2019ve been fantasizing about being your bamboo stalk for days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook asks sleepily, eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNothing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin scoots over, letting Jungkook wrap both arms around him. He nuzzles in against him, placing a palm flat across his chest, then closes his eyes, sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to be asleep in, like, three seconds, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jimin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s met with silence in response. Jungkook\u2019s breaths are evening out, slow and long. Jimin just laughs quietly against him, shaking his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he whispers into Jungkook\u2019s chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He falls asleep soon after that, snug under the weight of a heavily tattooed arm, feeling overwhelmingly safe and content, wishing he could stay here in Jeju with Jungkook forever.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span>\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Jimin wakes up, he\u2019s being actively crushed by a solid body. Jungkook has climbed almost fully on top of Jimin in his sleep, both arms and legs wrapped around him tightly. Jimin\u2019s face is pressed against his shoulder. Jungkook is still fast asleep, his head on Jimin\u2019s pillow, his breaths soft against Jimin\u2019s cheek.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin wheezes out, rubbing his arm a little, trying to wake him up. \u201cYou\u2019re squishing me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook groans, turning his head, then dropping it onto Jimin\u2019s pillow, face down. \u201cMmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think you accidentally activated killer koala mode.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s eyes squint open slightly, and then he seems to realize just how much of his weight is currently resting on top of Jimin\u2019s body. He rolls off him, repositioning himself so that he\u2019s lying on his side.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, still half asleep. \u201cDid I squish?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes. Very aggressively,\u201d Jimin confirms.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s because I like you,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, leaning over and resting the side of his face against Jimin\u2019s bicep.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says. He leans down and kisses the top of Jungkook\u2019s head. \u201cI like you too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMmm. Cute.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin scrunches his nose. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook is quiet, sighing against Jimin\u2019s arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you going back to sleep? I think we should probably get up. We only have a couple of hours before we need to check out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMm-hmm. I\u2019ll wake up,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cThis is just nice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin rolls onto his side a bit more, so that he\u2019s facing Jungkook directly. He looks beautiful like this: lashes sleepily fluttering against his cheeks, hair wavy and messy, his cheeks pink from where they were squished against Jimin as he slept.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you okay with what happened last night?\u201d Jimin asks him quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay is quite an understatement, I think,\u201d Jungkook says. He opens his eyes, blinking to clear them. \u201cI am\u2026 jubilant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAh, jubilant. That\u2019s a good word.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI am actually more interested in hearing how you feel about it,\u201d Jungkook says. He sounds a little nervous all of a sudden. \u201cJimin, before last night, I didn\u2019t\u2026 I really, legitimately didn\u2019t know how you felt. It felt like I was taking a huge risk, kissing you like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin says softly. \u201cI think I was just scared of getting hurt.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook frowns. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t feel that way. But I understand it. Especially after what happened with\u2026 actually, I\u2019m not even going to say his name. I don\u2019t even want to acknowledge his existence.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m happy he did that to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook asks, brows furrowing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf he didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have met you. So I think it was probably all meant to happen this way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook\u2019s face softens. \u201cOh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI like you so much,\u201d Jimin says quietly, suddenly feeling too nervous to look him in the eye. \u201cIt stopped being fake for me a long time ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was never fake for me,\u201d Jungkook admits, reaching out to tuck a bit of Jimin\u2019s hair behind his ear. \u201cWhich was highly emotionally irresponsible of me, so you can imagine how relieved I am now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot even at the beginning?\u201d Jimin asks, eyes widening.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m actually not a good actor at all. It only seemed real because I didn\u2019t have to pretend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin snuggles in a bit closer. \u201cWe\u2019re both idiots.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook bursts into laughter, tightening his arms around Jimin. \u201cI think we were doing our best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis feels like a dream,\u201d Jimin murmurs against Jungkook\u2019s chest, eyes closing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh, Jimin. You can\u2019t say stuff like that to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to bring out my fatal flaws. I\u2019m going to scare you away.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin pulls away to look at his face, his eyes twinkling. \u201cOh, no. Jungkook, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re in love with me. It\u2019s been a <em>day\u2014</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook laughs, then rolls over so that he\u2019s halfway on top of Jimin, smiling down at him. His face gets a little more serious, like he\u2019s pondering what he\u2019s going to say for a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that I\u2019m in love with you. But I\u2019ll tell you this\u2026\u201d he swallows. \u201cI think I <em>will</em> fall in love with you. If you give me the chance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin\u2019s heart skips a beat.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI will give you the chance,\u201d Jimin says softly. \u201cIf you give me the chance, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook leans down, pressing his mouth to Jimin\u2019s. The kiss is gentle and featherlight. It feels like a promise.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says, smiling. There\u2019s a tiny dimple in his left cheek, and Jimin reaches up to poke it. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p4\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u0489</span>\n<span class=\"s4\">\u3000</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat do you think about potatoes?\u201d Seokjin asks, his voice demanding. \u201cAnswer quickly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think they\u2019re great?\u201d Taehyung responds with wide eyes. \u201cWhy do I suddenly feel like... that was the wrong thing to say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, that was the correct answer,\u201d Seokjin says, draining the rest of his beer. \u201cThey are the perfect food. The best ingredient. If you\u2019d have said anything derogatory, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten on well. I think this friendship is off to a great start.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe loves gamja hotdogs,\u201d Hoseok helpfully pipes up from across the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI feel like you two are going to get along just fine,\u201d Yoongi says flatly, looking between Seokjin and Taehyung.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBecause you\u2019re both weird,\u201d Jimin whispers loudly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWeird!\u201d Seokjin gasps, setting down his glass. \u201cI\u2019m not weird. I\u2019m merely\u2026 distinguished. Perhaps a little eccentric, on occasion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLife is easier once you own up to it,\u201d Taehyung tells him, reaching across the table to pat his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJungkook, I\u2019m trying very hard to like your boyfriend\u2019s friends,\u201d Seokjin says. \u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m doing a good job.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d Jungkook reassures him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The six of them are seated together in a large booth at the White Rabbit, the same bar where Jungkook and Jimin first met. Jimin is curled up against Jungkook\u2019s side, Jungkook\u2019s arm looped around his shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s funny that you always used to make fun of me and Yoongi for our public displays of affection,\u201d Taehyung says to Jimin, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cNow look at you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is very tame!\u201d Jimin says, crossing his arms. \u201cFamily friendly, even.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be surprising to you,\u201d Yoongi says, turning to Taehyung. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been all over each other, even when they were pretending to pretend to like each other.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPretending to pretend to like each other,\u201d Taehyung says, eyebrows furrowing. \u201cThat is too many pretends for me to parse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat an exhausting phase,\u201d Seokjin says flatly. \u201cI had to listen to Jungkook drone on about Jimin all day every day. I almost asked him to start going to therapy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin asks, eyes widening.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019s exaggerating!\u201d Jungkook says, laughing nervously. \u201cAh, Seokjin, you\u2019re so funny. Such a comedian!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou cried over his butt once,\u201d Seokjin says. \u201cThat alone warranted therapy, I think.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>What</em>\u2014\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go dance?\u201d Jungkook suggests loudly, his cheeks turning pink. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had enough to drink. Clearly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin dissolves into laughter next to him, clinging to his arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank God. I couldn\u2019t bear another minute of this. No offense,\u201d Yoongi says. He slides out of the booth, and Taehyung follows him, taking his hand as they make their way out to the dance floor, weaving through the crowd.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Hoseok urges Seokjin, and they climb out of the booth as well. \u201cYou guys coming?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Jimin tells them, smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They walk away, leaving Jimin and Jungkook alone in the booth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin turns to Jungkook, trying to keep a straight face. \u201cYou really were down bad, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou already know I was!\u201d Jungkook says, covering his face with his hands. \u201cThis is not new information.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jimin says, laughing and pulling Jungkook\u2019s hands away from his face. \u201cI was too. You just didn\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI am truly so grateful that those days are behind us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMe too,\u201d Jimin says, leaning forward and kissing him softly. He lingers for a moment before pulling away. \u201cAlthough they were kind of fun, in their own way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think being able to kiss you whenever I want is more fun, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin scoots across the booth and climbs out, rising to his feet. He reaches out a hand to Jungkook. \u201cShall we dance?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jungkook takes his hand, rising to his full height and stepping in close.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you just want to dance, or do you want to put on a show?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jimin smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s put on a show.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>"
