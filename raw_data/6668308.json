  "summary": "<p>Only Harry Potter could manage to put on a magical collar on impulse and find himself unable to take it off again. Now following Draco\u2019s direct orders gives him intense pleasure, and Draco has a whole heap of troubles to deal with, not least the way Potter looks when the collar has him gasping with bliss. The whole situation would test the morals of a saint... and Draco\u2019s no saint.</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u201cSo, are you doing anything interesting tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This</em> is why my heart sank when I saw I was paired with Auror Potter again today. The constant bloody interruptions.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d I screw up my eye more firmly to hold the small Cognoscope eyepiece in place. The horned skull on the desk in front of me seems harmless enough, but there's no way I'm going to touch it before I've checked it over completely.</p>\n<p>Potter brushes my arm as he leans across the desk to get a better look. \u201cNasty little thing. Is it real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d I squint at it. \u201cProbably a Grindylow\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould that be used for Dark magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>This house belonged to Irving Lafarge, founder of the neo-Death Eater group Nox Anima, and I can guess all too clearly at the kind of things that happened here before Lafarge went on the run. I and my fellow Curse-Breakers will be working here in shifts all week, I\u2019d imagine - probably longer. \u201cIf you\u2019ll stop talking, I can do my job and find out,\u201d I tell Potter.</p>\n<p>He falls silent, but his mere presence is a distraction. He parks his backside on the desk, clearly intending to watch me work. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem - wouldn\u2019t be, with anyone else - but Potter is a special case. Being close to him\u2026 it\u2019s just unsettling. Like an itch under the skin. It used to be an urge to push him up against a wall and wipe the cocky grin from his face. It\u2019s now a little more than that, but\u2026 well. There\u2019s little point in dwelling on it.</p>\n<p>I can feel his eyes resting on me. I don\u2019t know what it is that he expects to see. \u201cHaven\u2019t you got anything better to do?\u201d I say, irritation apparent in my voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d When I look up, he\u2019s smiling at me again, though it falters when he sees my expression. \u201cI checked all the rooms as soon as we came in. There\u2019s no-one left here; Lafarge must have been tipped off.\u201d Potter\u2019s face shows the distaste he feels for the name. \u201cHe was long gone by the time the Aurors came in, and last week\u2019s raid cleared the rest of them out. I\u2019ve warded the whole place nice and tightly. Now I\u2019m just here to provide back-up if anything nasty jumps out at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I grit my teeth and turn my attention back to the skull. The spell to reveal magical traces is so familiar I can perform it wordlessly. As I thought - nothing except the merest glimmer of pale pink, indicating magic has been used in the vicinity... but only at normal levels, and nothing to interest us. I flick my wand over it, leaving a glowing seal bearing the initials <em>DM</em> to show that I\u2019ve checked it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very thorough,\u201d Potter observes softly.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t answer, just move on to an inkwell which looks like it\u2019s carved from jade.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was working with Breaker Marchant yesterday and he doesn\u2019t check half of the stuff that you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s mocking me or not and it makes my shoulders stiffen with irritation. \u201cYes, well, if he wants to take early retirement because he\u2019s lost an arm...\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks thoughtful. \u201cNow you mention it, there was a fire last week at a site he was working on.\u201d</p>\n<p>I snort. \u201cThere you are, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt livened things up a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>I turn my attention back to the inkwell. There\u2019s a mild Jinx on it, probably to deter thieves, and I disarm it with a couple of passes of my wand. \u201cI prefer to keep all of my fingers, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He falls silent and when I glance at him again, he\u2019s staring at my hands with a oddly intent gaze. \u201cYep. I see your point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter.\u201d There\u2019s a tension at my temples and I fight the urge to massage it away. \u201cI really can\u2019t work with you sitting there breathing all over me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns, his dark eyebrows pulling together. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBugger off for a bit, will you? Go and check the attic for Boggarts, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile pulls at his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of Boggarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Potter</em>.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is about him which gets me so riled up. Sometimes I think he does it on purpose to annoy me. Sometimes I think perhaps he knows that I feel the way I do, that he finds this amusing...</p>\n<p>He looks disappointed, then summons up the smile again. I suppose he\u2019s learned that charm will usually get him what he wants. \u201cOK. Just scream if that inkwell bites you, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>I keep my eyes fixed on my work as he walks away.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve given the inkwell, a pair of gloves, and tattered book of poetry a clean bill of health, and am just securing the eyepiece more firmly to examine a small black dagger when his voice comes from the other room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t sound anything urgent. I cast the revealing spell, and squint carefully at the results.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Now <em>this</em> is more like it. There's a distinct flicker of indigo in the magical traces around the handle. Remnants of Dark magic, without a doubt. Could be the imprint of someone who used it frequently. Or possibly some kind of curse. If so, it <em>looks</em> like it's all but faded away, but I can\u2019t be sure, until\u2014</p>\n<p>His voice calls again. \u201cCome and see this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm busy.\u201d I wonder about using a Levitation charm so I can examine the other side of the blade. Possibly too risky.</p>\n<p>\u201cFound something weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>I lower my wand. \u201cPotter, everything in here is weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome and look.\u201d</p>\n<p>I snatch the eyepiece from my eye and stash it back in my waistcoat pocket. Why can\u2019t he just do his blasted job and guard the place? He\u2019s not here to satisfy his childish curiosity about the contents. However, I know from experience that ignoring him is pointless. He's as stubborn as a troll.</p>\n<p>He's crouching in a dusty corner of what must have been the library, his head bent over something silvery lying in a flat wooden box. I look over his shoulder. It's certainly unusual \u2013 like a loop of liquid metal, not quite fixed in shape, which gleams against the black velvet lining the box.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you open that box?\u201d I ask curtly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're not meant to be poking around in here. They don't send Breakers in to these places for a laugh, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but this caught my eye and...\u201d He looks up at me, as if seeking my approval. \u201cI really wanted to see what was inside.\u201d He shrugs.</p>\n<p>Only Potter would be so infuriatingly arrogant. \u201cDon't touch anything else,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says, his attention already back on the silvery thing. There is something rather fascinating about it, the way it stirs in the box, looking almost alive. I imagine I can feel a sort of humming in the room, and I'm not sure if it's coming from the thing, or\u2014</p>\n<p>Potter pokes at it with his wand, and I flinch, and then feel foolish when nothing happens.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteady on, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don't know why I even react; he only does it to wind me up. Well, if he wants to get himself Hexed, that's his look-out. But I'll wager I'd be the one to get the blame back at the Ministry. \u201cStop dicking about, can't you?\u201d I tell him. \u201cI've got work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He peers closer at it. \u201cWait though. I've got this hunch that it's a collar. See that clasp there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could anyone wear something that squirms around like that? Leave it where you found it and I'll take a look at it later.\u201d I turn to go, but from the corner of my eye I see a flash of silver, and when I look round, the damn thing is in Potter's hands, like a fine rope of shimmering silk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShowing you I'm right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't\u2014 Potter! Fuck's sake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But he already has it looped around his neck. It settles neatly into a circle as soon as it touches his skin. \u201cThere. I told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin! Take it off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. It feels kind of...\u201d His fingers trail across it. \u201cIt actually fits really nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands up, and I can see the silvery coil shiver and then lie still against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it off. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down. No need to have a pole up your arse about everything.\u201d But his hands move to the back of his neck, seeking out the clasp. He takes so long, I have to resist the urge to knock his clumsy hands aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan't find the... Malfoy? Could you look?\u201d He turns his back to me, pulls the fabric of his tunic down to expose the messy hair at the nape of his neck and the band of metal now lying flush and still against his skin.</p>\n<p>There's no fastening at all. It's seamless, all the way around. I feel a cold throb of panic in my chest. I check in case it's got twisted around to the front, but\u2014 \u201cThe clasp's not there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He twists his neck around, feels with his thick fingers again. His eyes dart to mine, then he pulls at the collar, trying to loosen it. \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck have you done, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014 There was a fastening. Like a catch. It was so easy to put on.\u201d He yanks at it, and I see the band dig into his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He yanks again. It's not shifting, and his throat is getting red, and if he gets hurt in here, <em>I'm</em> the one who'll answer for it\u2014 \u201c<em>Stop</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>His fingers fall away and then \u2013 fucking hell \u2013 his face changes. \u201c<em>Uhh</em>.\u201d His eyes shut, and his mouth opens, but only a tortured exhalation comes out. \u201c<em>Uhhhhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you hurt?\u201d I try the first counter-curse that comes into my head, but the odds of guessing the right one are pathetically low.</p>\n<p>Potter's eyes open again and he blinks at me. He looks more surprised than scared. His fingers seek out the collar again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't touch it,\u201d I snap, and he brings his hand down to his side, but then he's gasping, eyes closed, and I see a fresh shudder run through him. <em>Fuck</em>. We need to get help. There\u2019ll be an investigation, and I knew this would happen, I knew trying to work with Potter was the worst kind of madness. He\u2019s undisciplined - unpredictable - and I can\u2019t keep a clear head when he\u2019s around at the best of times...</p>\n<p>The spasm seems to pass, and he opens his eyes, wide. \u201c<em>Shit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He just shakes his head. \u201cI don't know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin. Maybe I can just get the thing off his neck. \u201cStand still.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does, but then he's shuddering again, one arm groping out towards the wall for support, and, god, the groan that comes from his mouth... it's a strange, breathy thing, and it scares me.</p>\n<p>I aim my wand at his throat. The collar encircles it, taunting me. \u201cDon't move,\u201d I tell him, and almost as soon as I speak, the fucking thing shimmers, iridescent colours playing over its surface. Potter <em>moans</em>, and I don't dare cast, not while he's in the throes of it, his hand clenching against the wall as if he can hardly stay upright. As soon as it seems to fade away, I'm channeling my magic in readiness, and then more broken sounds come from Potter's throat and I realise he's laughing.</p>\n<p>Merlin. Is the thing sending him mad?</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d He rubs a hand across his face. \u201cThis is really fucked up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at me, flushed and surprised. \u201cIt doesn't <em>hurt</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>I lower my wand slightly. \u201cBut...\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks a little crazed around the eyes. His fingers twitch towards the collar again, as if he can't resist.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave the bloody thing <em>alone</em>,\u201d I snap, and his hand flies away as if burned. Then his eyes close, and he leans back against the wall, and I watch, horror and curiosity mingling inside me, as he pants his way through the latest bout.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2014<em>ahhh</em>\u2014 doesn't hurt at all,\u201d he says breathlessly, and his eyes open and latch onto mine, as green as glass. \u201cIt feels fucking incredible, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words jolt through me. Potter sinks down onto the ground, breathing hard. \u201cOh, god,\u201d he says, an odd smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's every time you try to touch it,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He wipes his face again. Sweat is beading on his top lip. \u201cIt's not that. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe've got to get it off. It's dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, but he sounds wistful.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you keep still while I look at it again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems to have stopped, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>I crouch down beside him warily. He's flushed and sort of loose-limbed, and I pull my eyes away and concentrate on the collar.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Diffibulo</em>,\u201d I try, the simplest Loosening Charm in the book, but nothing happens. I daren't try anything else without knowing something of the magic involved. \u201cCan you breathe normally?\u201d I ask him.</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn your head,\u201d I say, and as he does, his face contorts, eyes screwing shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, god...\u201d he moans. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's happening?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter. Tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he moans, and then shudders deeply as another wave hits him. \u201c<em>Uhhhh</em>, yes, yes. So good.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can't do anything but stare for a moment. He looks... god, the way he looks. His face is so different like this. And just for a minute, no matter how I try, I can\u2019t take my eyes off him.</p>\n<p>But then a wave of fury rises up in me. I'm going to get hauled through ten types of hell for this, there'll be a fucking enquiry for sure, and Potter's just sitting there, making noises like that, making those bloody faces, his hair sticking to his face, and his mouth hanging open in bliss.</p>\n<p>If only I could think straight. I'm still staring at Potter like a fool, and I haven't got the faintest clue what we're dealing with here. I'm going to have to take him in. I can just imagine the look on Head Curse-Breaker Rivett's face when I explain that my escort got cursed at the Lafarge house.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you stand up?\u201d I ask him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, but he doesn't move, just smiles at me, a little spaced out, as if this whole thing is some kind of joke.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin. Take my arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hand wraps around my forearm and then he's making those noises again, high and breathy, his fingers gripping tightly through my robes, and it's far too distracting to Apparate, we'd be Splinched in an instant\u2014</p>\n<p>I stare as the wave passes through him. \u201cMalfoy... hell. Don\u2019t talk any more.\u201d He closes his eyes, his breath fast and shaky. \u201cJust... shhh for a moment. Then, when I say <em>now</em>, Disapparate us straight away.\u201d</p>\n<p>I watch as he gets control of his breathing. His hand on my arm is trembling slightly. \u201cOK. Don\u2019t speak,\u201d he tells me, then takes a deep breath. \u201c<em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I can feel the heat from his body pressing against my side as the room squeezes impossibly tight around us and we whirl away into blackness.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~***~</p>\n<p>\u201cDescribe to us again where you were when the collar became fixed around Auror Potter\u2019s throat.\u201d Auror Halston runs a finger down the side of her quill.</p>\n<p>I fight the urge to let my head sink into my hands. \u201cI was with him in the library. He was in the far corner near the bookshelves, and I was near the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you claim he put it on entirely by his own choice?\u201d Auror Weasley says, not even trying to hide the disbelief in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>. For god\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve gone through this already!\u201d Heat is rising under my collar and I hope they don\u2019t notice. I probably look guilty. I <em>feel</em> guilty, and I didn\u2019t bloody do anything. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask <em>him</em> why he did it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAuror Potter\u2019s story corroborates yours, so far.\u201d Halston looks at me steadily. \u201cWhat we want to rule out is any outside influences at work. Do you have any contact with members of Nox Anima or their sympathisers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo I bloody don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKindly keep your temper, Curse-Breaker Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep my temper when I went through all this in great detail before I was accepted for training.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a surprise that someone with your background is always going to be\u2026 Well.\u201d Halston shrugs as if it\u2019s obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways going to be <em>what</em>, exactly?\u201d I knew it. This has stirred up things that I hoped were dead and buried years ago, unease swirling cold and heavy in my stomach. And Weasley sits there looking as if my existence is a personal insult to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you think I had to do with this,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI was just trying to do what I\u2019m paid for. It was Potter who decided to play dress-up with the contents of Lafarge\u2019s house, for god\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley brings his fist down on the table. \u201cHarry would never do something so stupid unless there was a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really? You find him to be someone who likes to follow the rules, do you? Stickler for procedure?\u201d</p>\n<p>He just glares at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d I continue. \u201cHarry Potter, the voice of reason. Never one to rush in and make a complete fucking mess of things, just on a whim.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley makes a low noise in his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s it been, three or four hours, now? Have you got the bloody thing off him yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Halston flicks an uneasy glance at Weasley. \u201cNot yet, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he still having those... spasms all the time?\u201d I feel an odd shiver at the thought of Potter\u2019s body, racked with sensation. His face knotted into such unfamiliar expressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuckily, he appears to be in perfect health,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he\u2019s fine, then what exactly is this about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Halston leans forward. \u201cAs we don\u2019t know the magical properties of the collar, Auror Potter could be vulnerable to attack for as long as he continues to wear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got someone working on that?\u201d A reminder that this is their problem, not mine, seems like a good move.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course we have.\u201d Weasley\u2019s face is a deeper shade of pink than usual. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best people possible on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBreakers? Let me guess... Theo Nott?\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley grunts in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSt Mungo\u2019s are working with us. They\u2019re monitoring any effects on Harry and looking for a solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Top people at St Mungo\u2019s. Your wife, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, his face challenging me to say more, and I\u2019d love to have an excuse to. But I\u2019ve worked with Granger before and she is actually a bloody fine Healer. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019d been brought in to sort out a cock-up that the Ministry couldn\u2019t cope with.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter\u2019s in good hands, then.\u201d At least I sound confident.</p>\n<p>Halston taps her quill on the parchment in front of her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind. Back to the report. What <em>exactly</em> were Auror Potter\u2019s words when he first found the collar?\u201d</p>\n<p>I sigh, and try not to think of Potter\u2019s face, slick with sweat, in thrall to god knows what. I try not to pay attention to the little voice in my head whispering <em>it\u2019s just as you feared. You have never really been trusted here at all</em>. Instead I answer the question and hope I describe everything in enough detail that this will be the end of it.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>Over a week passes. I don\u2019t get called back for further questioning, thank Merlin, and Weasley has to content himself with glowering at me whenever we pass in the Atrium. I hear Potter is in St Mungo\u2019s for observation. Then word is that he\u2019s back in the Auror department. Every time I\u2019m sent out to a location I expect him to be assigned to work with me, but it always turns out to be Hennings or Patil or Varley instead.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m disappointed. I\u2019m just interested in hearing whether or not they ever got to the bottom of it. But somehow it doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea to be asking around.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Monday morning and I\u2019m in the lab working on a bloody tricky counter-curse. I\u2019ve got the cursed item - it\u2019s a jewelled comb, the kind my mother might use to hold up an elaborate hairstyle - held in a network of Shield spells, and I\u2019m attempting to discharge the first of the curses on it within this safety zone when there\u2019s a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>I swear, loud and heartfelt. The sign on the door saying \u201cDo Not Disturb - Extreme Danger of Death\u201d is no joke. One wrong move and I\u2019d be the posthumous subject of a beautifully tragic speech from the Minister. Luckily the worst that\u2019s happened this time is that the Shield spells have got a little snarled up around one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoever that is, you can fuck right off!\u201d I shout, carefully looping the strands of the spells back together and knotting them more tightly than before. I\u2019m working on adding an extra layer for safety\u2019s sake when the knock comes again, louder and more forceful than before.</p>\n<p>I place an ultra-strength Stasis Charm around the whole lot and fling open the door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Potter.</p>\n<p>Of course it\u2019s Potter.</p>\n<p>I step outside the lab and slam the door shut. \u201cWhat the fucking hell do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>His jaw juts out mutinously. \u201cTo speak to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wearing a high-collared tunic, but as he shifts on the spot I see a glint of silver beneath.</p>\n<p>I gesture towards the lab. \u201cI\u2019ve got a delightful little trinket in there, and I strongly suspect that the main curse on it is poised ready to splinter it into a million razor-sharp pieces that will lodge in my flesh.\u201d I pause. \u201cThat\u2019s just the main one, Potter. I don\u2019t even know what the others might do. And you come and batter on the bloody door while I\u2019ve got my wand pointing at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has the grace to look a little abashed. \u201cI... needed to talk to you. And this was the first chance I got.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to say... I\u2019m sorry. If you got a load of shit about...\u201d He reaches up and pulls the neckline of his tunic down, revealing the shining circle of the collar. It sits so snugly around his neck, close to his Adam\u2019s apple.</p>\n<p>The sight of it seems to take the bite out of my anger. His throat looks so vulnerable, somehow. \u201cThey didn\u2019t manage to get it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet. They\u2019re still meant to be working on it, but honestly I think Robards is just hoping everyone will forget about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He straightens his tunic back up so it\u2019s no longer visible, and I find myself staring at the spot where it was.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you... I mean, have you...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had any more episodes, no.\u201d His face is unusually serious.</p>\n<p>I clear my throat. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives me a look that I can\u2019t quite decipher, then nods. \u201cI suppose so. Anyway. I am sorry. I imagine they questioned the living shit out of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I give a rather humourless smile. \u201cTen points to Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too. Apparently no-one can accept the fact I just decided to put the bloody thing on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m smirking. \u201cI would have expected them to know you better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile pulls at his lips. \u201cHah. Perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what have they tried?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the...?\u201d He gestures to his throat again, and I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cLoads of things. I felt like one of those spiders Moody kept in a jar after all of the stuff they cast at me. Endless tests. Different spells. I was ready to Hex the lot of them by the end of it. But after about a week, when they couldn\u2019t shift it, and they realised it doesn\u2019t do me any harm anyway, I think they gave up.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a discomfiting thought, knowing the collar is right there, next to his skin. That he\u2019s walking around the Ministry wearing it\u2026 I wonder how many people know about it. I bet they\u2019ve kept it pretty quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m on desk duty. They can\u2019t risk letting me in the field in case... you know. <em>Unknown forces</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>My eyes flick to the closed door of my office, then back to Potter\u2019s tunic, pulled high over his throat, hiding what I know lies beneath. \u201cDo you want me to take a look at it?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes widen for a moment. Then he pushes his glasses further up his nose. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019d be mad to try. They had Nott working on it. He\u2019ll have exhausted every option already. And if word gets back to the Auror office that I\u2019ve so much as cast <em>Accio</em> in Potter\u2019s vicinity... well, I\u2019ve no desire to be hauled in for questioning again.</p>\n<p>I find myself nodding. \u201cIf you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>The surly expression has vanished now. \u201cIt\u2019s funny... I don\u2019t mind wearing it. You know, the feel of it. But I fucking hate being stuck behind a desk.\u201d He looks around. \u201cWhere should we...?\u201d</p>\n<p>It should be in the lab, really. But there\u2019s that damned comb and the mess of Shield Spells, and I can easily lock the door to my office. Perhaps Potter is not the only one who can break the rules. \u201cHow about here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods.\"OK.\u201d</p>\n<p>I gesture to a seat and he sinks down into it while I perch on the desk next to him. \u201cCan you...?\u201d I mime loosening my shirt.</p>\n<p>He pulls the tunic down again, and there it is. There\u2019s something compelling about the sight of it around his neck. The way it almost constricts his Adam\u2019s apple.</p>\n<p>I draw my wand. \u201cI need your hands well out of the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cThe neckline\u2019s designed to stay up.\u201d He lets go of the fabric, and just as he says, the tunic covers the collar again. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better take it off?\u201d</p>\n<p>I suddenly remember that I haven\u2019t locked the door yet. I flick my wand and there\u2019s a satisfying click. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>Potter takes hold of the hem of his tunic and pulls it over his head in one smooth motion, and something about it is so unexpected that I\u2019m taken aback, just for a moment.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m prudish. It\u2019s only that I don\u2019t usually have men stripping off in my office on a Monday morning.</p>\n<p>I stand up abruptly and move to rummage in one of the desk drawers, turning my back on half-naked Potter. I might need the Cognoscope... there it is. I take a deep breath and turn around. Potter\u2019s still sitting there, his tunic tossed onto the desk beside him. I can\u2019t help my eyes flicking across his torso. There\u2019s a lot more lean muscle than I\u2019d imagined. The way those tunics are cut, they don\u2019t give you much idea of what\u2019s underneath. I guess I should have known to expect the dark hair which rings his nipples and trails lazily down\u2014</p>\n<p>I tighten my grip on my wand. \u201cRight.\u201d I can\u2019t meet his eyes for a moment. I need to concentrate, so I look at the collar instead. He swallows, and the collar moves along with the bobbing of his throat.</p>\n<p>I force myself to look him in the face, and it\u2019s lit with hopefulness and I have to look away altogether. \u201cFace that way,\u201d I tell him, pointing to the door, and he turns, and then <em>oh fuck</em>, I see the first tremor of it begin and then a great wash of rapture hits him and ripples through his whole body. I see his stomach tighten and his fingers curl into fists. The <em>sound</em> he makes - it sears through me. His chest flushes, and his\u2014 <em>holy fuck</em>, his nipples are tightening and he\u2019s gasping with it, and I feel my own body tremble, too. I should never have done it. I should have slammed the door in his bloody face as soon as I saw him. His eyes open and fix on me and his mouth is soft and open and amazed and, god, I\u2019m so fucked.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he says, and his voice is slightly hoarse. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how good it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck! Don\u2019t\u2014!\u201d I say, and there\u2019s panic in my voice, because if something bad happens to Harry Potter right here in my office, with the door locked, I may never see anything beyond Azkaban\u2019s four walls again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he asks, and there\u2019s a hint of a smile to it, the bastard.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t do <em>anything</em>,\u201d I say, and he\u2019s off again, as bad as the first time. He <em>groans</em> with it, and watching him is so intense that it\u2019s as though I feel it right in my own core, reverberating through me. His chest and throat mottle with pink, he lets his head fall back and his face is twisted and blissful.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, god, yes,\u201d he croaks. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew <em>what</em>?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell when it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe collar gets warm, and my skin kind of tingles.\u201d He takes a shaky breath. \u201cIt's when you speak\u2014 no, that\u2019s not it. Not every time, but when you tell me to do something. I feel it around my throat, at first, but it spreads out, and then...\u201d He puts a hand up to his throat, touches his own skin tentatively. \u201cAnd then...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is low, but clear. \u201cAnd then I really want to do what you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a buzzing in my ears. What the fuck is this? Potter piles madness upon madness. But something inside me, something hungry, sits up straight as if it has scented fresh meat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just... it feels like it would be a really good idea. I can\u2019t explain it. Actually, I sort of can. Did you ever take Felix Felicis?\u201d</p>\n<p>I shake my head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Pity. It\u2019s a bit like that. You just <em>know</em> that if you do such-and-such a thing, something brilliant is going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>A terrible energy is swelling inside me. This isn\u2019t right. Can\u2019t be. Hell, I\u2019m meant to be helping Potter, not feeling some gloating interest in the effects of the thing\u2026 \u201cYou feel forced to do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s entirely my choice. But I\u2019d be a fool to go against it when it feels this good.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t quite take it in. Potter wants to do things when I tell him to. But\u2014 \u201cYou mean, it just happens with me? Nobody else?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cDefinitely not. Robards is a bossy fucker. I\u2019d be like a bloody Flobberworm on the floor if this happened every time he gave me an order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin.\u201d Just me. The words thrum in my head. <em>Just me</em>. \u201cDid you tell them about this when they questioned you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t sure. I was a bit distracted at the time, you know, when we were in the house. \u201c He gives a little laugh. \u201cI only really worked it out afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014 I don\u2019t believe it. You must be mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me to do something,\u201d and his eyes flare with heat as he looks at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me to do something. Anything. Just tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know? Don\u2019t you want to know if I\u2019m right? Come on, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>My throat is so dry. I can\u2019t think of a single thing to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything. Come on. Tell me\u2014 tell me to close my eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m looking at him as if he\u2019s dangerous. He<em> is</em> dangerous. I swallow hard. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes flash at me, brilliant green, and then they flutter closed, and it\u2019s almost instantaneous. First a low shaky sound pulls from his chest, and then he grips the edge of the desk, his knuckles turning white. \u201cOh, fucking hell, yes,\u201d he moans. \u201cMalfoy, oh god.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have a clue what to do. This is madness. Potter gets what looks like a rush of pure unadulterated bliss when he does what I say. <em>Anything</em> I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut your hands on your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hands are moving almost before I finish speaking. <em>Oh, fuck</em>. His hands reach his head and his body is bucking with it, his mouth hanging open, eyes closed, his stomach taut with what looks like waves of sensation. God help me. It\u2019s true. Why the hell does this feel the way it does? I\u2019m dizzy with it. The possibilities. Heat floods through me and something like the desire to laugh bubbles up inside, wicked and shameless.</p>\n<p>I look at Potter, his breathing fast and ragged, but returning to normal. My hands are shaking with a nauseous excitement, and suddenly I\u2019m disgusted with myself. I remind myself exactly whose house the collar came from. Who would make such a thing? The kind of twisted sod who\u2019d enjoy someone being in thrall to them against their will, that\u2019s who. It\u2019s like a bloody sickness - what kind of a bastard am I, to even think of <em>using</em> this?</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you.\u201d There\u2019s the ghost of a sly smile on Potter\u2019s face. \u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d He\u2019s sitting there in the chair, looking\u2014 god, he looks pretty much like he\u2019s been well-fucked.</p>\n<p>I wet my lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, should we tell someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shit. \u201cYes.\u201d <em>Shit</em>. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins. \u201cBit fucking weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>How can he sit there and <em>laugh</em> about it? \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019m pretty sure I can resist it if I want to. I just don\u2019t want to. And...\u201d He looks up at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to use it against me.\u201c</p>\n<p>He should know better than to be so trusting. It makes something squirm in my chest before anger rises up instead. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d I ask him sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Are you?\u201d He looks stern, then, his brows pulled down.</p>\n<p>This is so screwed up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to use it at <em>all</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>If we disclose this to Robards, to my boss Rivett, everyone\u2019s going to lose the fucking plot. Me, having power over Potter? Hell. At worst, it will confirm all of their suspicions. That I did this for some nefarious reason. I have to admit it looks unbelievably bad.</p>\n<p>The alternative: we say nothing. And go about our lives with the knowledge that I have some weird kind of power over Potter\u2019s desires, which I can choose to use at any time.</p>\n<p>Salazar fucking Slytherin. How can I keep quiet about this? \u201cWe have to tell Robards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks pretty unhappy at the mere thought. \u201cMore tests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore interrogations for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just... wait and see?\u201d He waves a hand. \u201cIt might wear off.\u201d He sees my sceptical expression. \u201cWell. It could do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose\u2014 They might yet find a way to break whatever enchantment\u2019s been placed on the collar.\u201d It sounds unlikely, even to my own ears.</p>\n<p>Potter nods. \u201cYeah. They might. They probably will, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>I look at him, taking in the beads of sweat at his temples, the flush at his throat. The lean strength of his body. God, he could tempt a man to do terrible things.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what we <em>should</em> do.\u201d It feels intoxicating. Thinking about conspiring with Potter like this.</p>\n<p>He pulls a face. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He shakes his head and a thick lock of hair falls across his forehead. \u201cBut how about we just give it a week and see?\u201d</p>\n<p>I hesitate.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a week, Malfoy. We don\u2019t have to be around each other during that time. Think about it - if I hadn\u2019t turned up here this morning, we\u2019d still be none the wiser.\u201d</p>\n<p>My eyes narrow. \u201cWhy <em>did</em> you come here this morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>His jaw juts out again. \u201cTo apologise. Remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>I give him a hard look that he doesn\u2019t seem entirely comfortable with.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK. I admit... I did wonder.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI just... had a hunch about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and your fucking hunches!\u201d</p>\n<p>The infuriating smile is twitching at his lips. \u201cMy hunches are usually spot on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour hunches are going to get me thrown into Azkaban.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face drops and his voice turns serious again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get you into trouble, Malfoy. I\u2019m just saying, why don\u2019t we give it some time? Keep away from one another. They\u2019re not going to assign us to work together again. Not after what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s probably right. It makes a lot of sense. For both of us. So why is there a knot clenching in my stomach at the prospect? \u201cAll right. One week. And then...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see,\u201d he finishes for me.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t honestly think of a better alternative. My eyes flick down, unwilling, over his body again, past the neat dip of his navel to the V of muscle peeking above his waistband, and irritation flares inside me. \u201cPut some clothes on, for god\u2019s sake, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cNo need to get arsey.\u201d As he reaches for his tunic, I realise what I\u2019ve said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter\u2014 no. You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s already pulled the tunic over his head and is shivering with pleasure even as he pulls it down over his body. \u201c<em>Ahhhh</em>.\u201d He bites his lip, white teeth digging into the softness of it, and I force myself to look away. Not to watch him in this moment which feels so very intimate, no matter how much I\u2019d like to.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t look back until he\u2019s still again and I can hear his breathing slowing down. The collar is hidden once more, lying apparently innocent under the stiff fabric of his tunic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen,\u201d I say quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2014 It\u2019s OK.\u201d</p>\n<p>After he\u2019s gone, I sit at my desk, trying to regain the necessary focus to resume work in the lab again. Trying to stop thinking about what might have happened if instead of telling Potter to put some clothes <em>on</em>, I\u2019d asked him to\u2014</p>\n<p><em>No</em>. I close my eyes and dig my nails into my palm until my eyes prick with water and the images of Potter are replaced by red and black splotches of nothingness. Merlin, it\u2019s been too damn long since I took anyone to my bed. That\u2019s why this is affecting me so much. That\u2019s why my mind is spinning lurid fantasies about someone who would never have the slightest interest in pursuing anything with me.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all it is.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a very long week indeed. They\u2019ve decided I can be trusted to work on the contents of the Lafarge house again, but since the incident with Potter, the Ministry has deemed it too dangerous to work at the site itself. Instead, one item after another is transported under top-level security to my lab for me to deal with. The paperwork alone is horrendous, and there\u2019s pressure to sift through the objects quickly in order to get the job completed. With this in mind, I would have been coming in early every day anyway. The fact that I want to make sure I arrive for work long before Potter usually shows his face in the Atrium is purely incidental.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t see one another. I don\u2019t leave the lab for hours at a time, and seldom venture out of my office if I can avoid it. I wonder from time to time how he\u2019s getting on. Whether they\u2019ve pulled him back in for testing. I imagine him in one of their observation chambers, restless and irritable, the collar gleaming about his throat. Perhaps they\u2019ve found a way to remove it by now. That\u2019s the most likely thing.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t spare the time for a lunch break, but I\u2019m sitting at my desk with a sandwich in one hand and a well-thumbed copy of Bardin\u2019s <em>Heinous Curses</em> in the other when there\u2019s a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d I say irritably.</p>\n<p>Theo Nott\u2019s head appears round the door. \u201cCan you spare five minutes?\u201d</p>\n<p>I slide an old memo into the book to keep my place. \u201cCertainly, if you don\u2019t mind me finishing my lunch while we talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>He steps inside, looking at his pocket watch. \u201cRather late for lunch, isn\u2019t it? I know they\u2019re working us all ragged, but a man\u2019s got to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>I tug at my hair distractedly. \u201cThe Lafarge house. Got something vile from there in the lab and I\u2019m not sure where to go with it next. Some days I think it will never end.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tilts his head. \u201cThe Lafarge house was what I wanted to speak to you about, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Potter case. You know.\u201d He gestures to his own throat and I feel something turn over in my stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm? Oh, that,\u201d I say, sounding as if the subject doesn\u2019t interest me in the least.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t get anywhere with it. We can\u2019t try half the stuff we\u2019d like to because it\u2019s around Potter\u2019s precious neck. What is it - two weeks now? And they\u2019re still furious that they can\u2019t get the bloody thing off. They\u2019ve had me and Hartnell working on it - even got some terrifying old witch over from Russia who\u2019s meant to be the troll\u2019s bollocks at working with Dark magic, and no-one can make so much as a dent in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what my face is doing, but he gives me an odd look. \u201cYou were there, yes? When it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>I give a small grunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know they\u2019ve pumped you for information already, but... you don\u2019t have any ideas for me, do you? Even some quite random detail might give us something to work on. You know, changes you noticed in the magical activity in the room, or any little thing Potter might have said at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>I push my plate away. The sandwich is stale anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter said he experienced some strange effects when he first wore it, but we haven\u2019t been able to recreate those in tests at all. How did he look when he first put it on? Did you notice him getting overheated, perhaps, or did he go quiet, or\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really <em>don\u2019t</em> remember, Nott.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>There was sweat beading on his top lip, and he gasped with every shudder that ran through him. At first I thought he was in pain, can you imagine that? And then I realised that this was how he looked when he was lost in pleasure. Too far gone to even speak. He looked so fucking </em>carnal<em>, the way he gave himself over to it. And you know the thing I can\u2019t stop thinking about? </em>I<em> did that to him. A few words from me is all it takes for that to happen.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you.\u201d I stand up abruptly. \u201cI must get back to the lab now.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a crease at the top of Theo\u2019s nose. \u201cI see.\u201d An awkwardness hangs in the air and I feel pretty sure he knows something is up. \u201cWell, sorry to have bothered you,\u201d is all that he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shuts the door behind him and I lock it with a flick of my wand. It\u2019s <em>not</em> a problem. I\u2019m fine as long as I don\u2019t think about it. I open to page 170 of <em>Heinous Curses</em> and begin taking quick notes about how to distinguish the jay\u2019s wing sheen of a Blood-Thinning Curse from the petrol-blue shimmer of a classic Entrail-Expeller.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>Three o\u2019clock on a Friday afternoon and I\u2019ve already finished for the week. One of the advantages of starting work an hour or two early every day. Diagon Alley smells wonderfully fresh after the sulphurous curse-haze of my lab. It\u2019s sunny enough to have me unbuttoning my robes as I walk over the cobblestones towards Scribbulus.</p>\n<p>And then, amongst the crowds, I see him. Looks like he\u2019s on patrol with Weasley, the gold buttons on their scarlet tunics catching the sunlight. Potter\u2019s eyes sweep left and right, scanning the crowds for signs of wrong-doing. He spots me long before Weasley does. He falters in his stride and almost stumbles until Weasley catches him by the elbow, frowning.</p>\n<p>I pause in the doorway of Twilfitt\u2019s, the breath gone out of me for a moment. Weasley sees me, then, and treats me to a fine glare. Potter\u2019s resumed his Auror stance \u2013 shoulders square, chin up \u2013 but there\u2019s something dark and wild about his eyes as they meet mine.</p>\n<p><em>Oh, Potter</em>. There\u2019s the briefest glint of silver at his throat as he passes and I must be half-crazed with exhaustion from the long week, because all I can think is that I could have him on his knees if I wanted to. Right here, in front of all of these people. Shivering, and moaning, and trembling at my feet.</p>\n<p>I clench my fists in my pockets as a great wave of desire batters at me. God, temptation is a terrible, cruel thing. Potter merely keeps walking until his scarlet uniform disappears into the crowds again. I stare, expressionless, at a display of hats in the window until the wayward drumbeat of my heart calms itself.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>Elf-made wine is always worth the extra you pay for it. This vintage has a deliciously spicy afterglow, and I close my eyes and let it warm my throat, all the way down to my stomach. It\u2019s mild enough this evening that I didn\u2019t really need to light a fire, but the flickering at the hearth just adds to the sense of comfort and contentment I feel as I unbutton my robes and let my head fall back against the armchair. This promises to be the most relaxing evening I\u2019ve had for a long time.</p>\n<p>A sudden jangling of the wards jars me upright. My first instinct is to ignore whichever mannerless bastard has turned up unannounced, but there\u2019s a note of urgency to it.</p>\n<p>As I open the door, a flurry of wind blows in and there is Potter, on the doorstep, his hair ruffled and a snug woollen roll neck jumper covering his chest and throat.</p>\n<p>His smile is genuine and surprising but there\u2019s something \u2013 a nervousness, a tightness \u2013 around his eyes. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, as coldly as I can.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed your help?\u201d His voice lilts up at the end.</p>\n<p>I hesitate, looking him up and down. No cloak. His boots look like they\u2019ve been hastily pulled on over his jeans, the laces all anyhow, as if coming here was a spur of the moment decision. Another gust of wind circles the street and tries to blow in at the door.</p>\n<p>I frown. \u201cCome in, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>I gesture to Potter to take the other armchair and we sit by the fire. It seems churlish to enjoy my wine without offering any to a guest, and god knows I do feel the need of another drink now. Potter smiles when I summon a glass for him and fill it near to the brim. \u201cCheers.\u201d He tips his head back to drink and I see the rim of the collar peeking over the soft blue of his jumper, and the bob of his throat as he swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d I ask, rather curtly.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t meet my eyes, then, instead looking down at his lap. \u201cHmm. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe agreed it was best to keep our distance.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods ruefully. \u201cYeah. That was a good plan. Except...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept what?\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls the neck of his jumper down, revealing the silver band. It seems to glow a little in the dim light. He meets my eyes again and holds them. \u201cExcept this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to do with me, Potter. Talk to Nott. Talk to Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, neither can I.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes flicker with something I don\u2019t recognise. \u201cAh, but you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shift in my seat. I should never have let him in. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt keeps feeling... itchy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I let my lip curl. \u201cI\u2019m not a skin Healer.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mouth twitches briefly with amusement. \u201cNot like that. Like... it wants something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin. There\u2019s a flare of heat in my stomach, beyond the spice of the wine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches for his glass, takes a sip. His mouth glistens with wine for a second and then he swipes his tongue over his lip. \u201cIt\u2014 I can feel what it wants.\u201d He takes another swallow of wine as if to give himself courage, then says, slowly, \u201cIt wants me to do things for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is no conceivable answer to this, so I stay silent.</p>\n<p>He looks down at his lap again. \u201cI was... hoping you could help me out a bit.\u201d He glances up at me. \u201cI know it sounds mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything feels slightly unreal. \u201cHelp you... how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me to do stuff. You know, like before. Just... anything, really. It wouldn\u2019t take much to keep it happy, I don\u2019t think.\u201d He looks so bloody hopeful, but all I can think of is him stripped to the waist and moaning. Here on the floor, before my fire.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then he\u2019s on his feet. \u201cNo. Sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d He\u2019s not meeting my eye. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d He attempts an unconvincing grin. \u201cI just thought you might be glad of the chance to get me to do your washing up, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know if I can,\u201d I blurt out.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Course not. I\u2019ll leave you alone. Apologies.\u201d He turns to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter.\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard as I stand up, and I think perhaps he is too.</p>\n<p>He turns to look at me. His eyes are so unguarded.</p>\n<p>I close mine for a moment. \u201cIt just... it would be wrong. To take advantage of you when you can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cWhen I can\u2019t help it?\u201d</p>\n<p>I gesture to the collar. \u201cIf I tell you to do something, and you\u2019ve no choice about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. No, that\u2019s not how it is at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you. It\u2019s up to me whether I do what you say or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said that before.\u201d I wave my hand impatiently. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how it works, is it? You <em>always</em> do what I say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>have</em> to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d I say, not hiding my scepticism.</p>\n<p>His jaw is jutting again. \u201cListen, Malfoy. I can shake off Imperius if I want to. This?\u201d He touches the collar lightly. \u201cThis is nothing. Nobody makes me do something unless I agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes flash. \u201cOK, then. Try me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry me. Tell me to do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks so bloody cocksure, it would almost be a pleasure to prove him wrong.</p>\n<p>I wet my lips. Something simple would be best. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t move, but almost immediately, I notice a tension in his body. As if he\u2019s having to check himself. I don\u2019t say anything. Potter just stands there, but after a minute, I can see he\u2019s gritting his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not letting him off that easily. \u201cI said, <em>sit down</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, he lets out a small unhappy sound. There\u2019s a vein pulsing at his temple. I keep my eyes fixed on him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uh</em>,\u201d he says after a few long moments. \u201cOK, it\u2019s actually harder than I was expecting.\u201d He lets out a choked little laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant some more?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says, and I see him clench his fists at his side in readiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter. <em>Sit down</em>,\u201d I tell him, and this time he looks as if it\u2019s painful. There\u2019s a trickle of sweat making its way down from his forehead. I watch, entranced. I can\u2019t remember whether I want him to resist or not.</p>\n<p>He lets out a long, shaky breath. \u201cI can do this. It\u2019s just... I know how good it would be. That\u2019s all. It makes it a little difficult. \u201c Again the little laugh. \u201cHave you had enough, yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure. Part of me wonders what would happen if I were to continue. I look at him, the tightness in his jaw, the strained look on his face. There\u2019s something deeply fascinating about the whole process, the idea of him struggling against it. The thought of trying to break down his resistance, to\u2014 \u201cYes. Of course I have,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou admit I can resist it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. But it wasn\u2019t <em>nothing</em>, was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>His smile is lopsided. \u201cNo. No, it wasn\u2019t. But I did it. I win, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You win.\u201d I watch his body relax, watch him roll his shoulders to release the tension. \u201cNow, sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He begins to tense up again before I see him make the decision to let go. He sinks into the chair and then it\u2019s as if the intensity of what\u2019s flooding through him takes him by surprise. \u201c<em>Ahhh</em>,\u201d he moans, and his whole body seems to surrender to it, and, Merlin, it\u2019s beautiful. His face is transported with it, each shiver that runs through him seeming to take him deeper, and I can\u2019t take my eyes from him.</p>\n<p>It still feels wrong to be watching this. To collude with him in letting this happen. But for a brief time, I find that I can\u2019t resist any more. I can\u2019t resist <em>him</em>\u2014 not like this, not in this moment of blissful surrender. Something in me lets go, too, and it feels as inevitable as night after day.</p>\n<p>A log falls in the grate and the fire flares up, throwing intriguing patterns of light and shade over his face as the shivers start to subside. His eyes open again and fix on me, and he smiles, looking a little embarrassed. \u201cUh. Wow,\u201d he says. He lets his head fall back again for a moment. \u201cI still win, though, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time I laugh as well. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was... that was really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy... is this OK?\u201d He lifts his head again to look at me. \u201cI mean, oh, god.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>My palms are prickling with sweat.\u201cI was uncomfortable about you having no choice about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. Really.\u201d He looks at me, his face serious, until I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut... you don\u2019t have to do this, if... you know. You don\u2019t have to do anything at all.\u201d The firelight on his face is hypnotic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I can help you out. If you\u2019re sure.\u201d Merlin, what a hypocrite I am. Pretending it\u2019s all for his benefit.</p>\n<p>He looks so serious, but also so hopeful. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to...?\u201d</p>\n<p>He inclines his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>I let out a long breath. \u201cI just\u2014 I worry about what\u2019s going to happen. If we do this.\u201d <em>I worry about how I will feel</em>. But I can hardly say that. I can\u2019t tell him that I\u2019ll still be thinking about this, long after he\u2019s gone, thinking about the way he looked and the way that it makes me want him...</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cJust let it happen. If you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t think of what to say. \u201cStand up,\u201d I say, and then realise my mistake as he starts to stand and has to hold onto the armchair for support as his legs shake. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uh</em>, fuck. Mmm. God.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t wait for it to pass before I speak again. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>His teeth dig into his lip as if to stop himself crying out, but a ragged sound still emerges. \u201cYesss...\u201d</p>\n<p>This one lasts longer, and I\u2019m dizzy just from watching him by the time it\u2019s finished. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d I ask him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d His head lolls against my armchair, and I\u2019m glad he seems too out of it for the moment to notice the look on my face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat should I tell you to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Telling him to stand seems to make it unnecessarily hard for him. I can hardly think straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me to do it, Malfoy.\u201d His eyes are so bright; I feel pinned by them. He speaks slowly, emphasising the words. \u201cAnything you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know I\u2019m going to say it until I hear the word come out of my mouth. It seems to come from a place I keep fairly well-buried, but there he is, eager and willing, and \u201c<em>Kneel</em>,\u201d I tell him. Just like that, he\u2019s sliding onto the floor at my feet and groaning aloud, and I\u2019m lost, I\u2019m so fucking lost. His shoulders are shaking, and his head falls back, and it\u2019s almost too much. He\u2019s trembling, and making a low crooning sound, and I want to touch him, but I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He takes a little while to open his eyes this time, and when he does, he looks... there\u2019s something so grateful about his face that it kills me. \u201cUh. That was... well, uh. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know why I do it. I\u2019m sitting forward in the armchair now. \u201cCome here,\u201d I say, and he shuffles forwards on his knees until he\u2019s between the V of my legs, groaning as he does. His mouth falls open, his eyes close, and for a moment I forget that it\u2019s only the collar making him feel this way. For just a moment, it feels like it\u2019s me that he wants, that he makes these sounds out of desire for me.</p>\n<p>My hand goes out to cup his jaw, and the scratch of his stubble against my palm makes sparks of heat jolt up my arm. I breathe in the scent of his arousal, and I\u2019m drunk on it: Harry Potter, at my feet, incoherent with need. His breath hitches as he turns his face as if to brush his lips against my wrist, and I see the cursed collar at his throat, and I remember it\u2019s just some fucked-up magic from the hand of Irving Lafarge. Of course Harry Potter doesn\u2019t want Draco Malfoy. This isn\u2019t <em>real</em>.</p>\n<p>I pull my hand away as if the touch of his skin has burned me. It takes him a minute to notice, lost in his own pleasure as he is. \u201cMalfoy...\u201d he murmurs. \u201cGod, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hot ache in my chest. He just craves more and more of what the collar can give him. His face is soft and open; I have no doubt I could take whatever I want from him, but, damn it, haven\u2019t I got more self-respect than that?</p>\n<p>I pull away from him, from the seductive strength of his body, acquiescent at my feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy...\u201d He croons my name, full of yearning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. It comes out far more harshly than I intended, and he flinches back. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d I tell him, and something in his stance becomes wary, as if expecting a blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it wouldn\u2019t take much to fix it,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re finished now.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes are still soft, but he turns them to the floor and then he nods. \u201cOK.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still down there, kneeling at my feet, and I want to tell him to get up, for god\u2019s sake, but we both know what will happen if I do. Instead I get up myself and turn away, walk to the bookshelf with my hands stuffed into my pockets.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rustling and then a cough from behind me. I turn my head and he\u2019s on his feet, looking rather embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thanks, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I incline my head in acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have disturbed your evening,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d My mother used to tell me my tongue would turn black if I told lies. Merlin, mine must be as black as pitch.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s face is guarded again, his brows pulled low. But his eyes still flick across my face as if searching for something.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to use the Floo?\u201d I ask, but Potter shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink I\u2019ll walk for a while. Clear my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>I go with him to the door, then, when he\u2019s on the step, the wind ruffling at his hair: \u201cIf you came again.\u201d I stop myself there, not even sure what I\u2019m about to say. \u201cI mean... if it was necessary.\u201d I hate the way even the thought of it sets heat roaring through me. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some emotion I can\u2019t place crosses his face, but all he says is, \u201cI\u2019ll try not to bother you any more.\u201d</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>Another week passes. Ten days. I go to work early. I deal with object after object. I eat lunch at my desk. I do my paperwork. I go home. I sleep. I go to work again. One night I go to a bar and buy drinks for a tall, rugged-faced stranger, but my heart\u2019s not in it and I skulk off to the gents and Apparate home without saying goodbye.</p>\n<p>At home I toss and turn and not even a slow, thorough wank can relax me. The next day I\u2019m tired enough to sleep through the alarm and wake to find my wand vibrating furiously on the bedside cabinet. It\u2019s well after eight o\u2019clock and I rush through my shower and breakfast to arrive at the Ministry a scant minute before nine. As I step out into the Atrium there\u2019s a flash of red and I know without looking that it\u2019s him. Twenty strides will take me to the fountain. His hair needs combing. I can\u2019t see the collar. If it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s tucked safely under his tunic.</p>\n<p>Another twenty to the lifts. Potter stops to greet a witch wearing brilliant turquoise robes. His eyes crinkle at something she says, and I\u2019m nearly past them when a movement catches my eye near the Welcome Desk. It\u2019s just a brief scuffle, but then I feel the crackle of Dark magic. Working with curses all day, one gets sensitised to it. It\u2019s only a flicker at first, but it makes my skin crawl. My wand is in my hand, and then I see it \u2014 a blue shimmer, streaking towards the fountain. Towards Potter.</p>\n<p>I cast a nice solid <em>Protego</em>, but it\u2019s not going to be enough, and I\u2019m yelling, too. \u201cPotter! Get down!\u201d My voice is harsh and urgent. He looks up, sees the flash of blue and, my god, his reflexes are stunning. He hits the floor, graceful and fast, and the curse flies over his head, slices through my Shield Charm and just keeps on going.</p>\n<p>Then all fucking chaos breaks loose.</p>\n<p>The curse hits the fountain. Potter\u2019s on all fours on the floor. And he\u2019s moaning, god, he\u2019s moaning really <em>loud</em>, the sound echoing across the Atrium, and for a second I think the curse got him after all, but then I see his face, and the way his body arches, and I realise. He followed my fucking order. And now he\u2019s reaping the rewards.</p>\n<p>Then one of the statues from the fountain wobbles and falls, crashing to the floor, and people are screaming. A tall, scrawny wizard by the Welcome Desk shouts \u201cIn the name of Nox Anima!\u201d and then three Aurors have him in a Body Bind. It\u2019s bedlam, but I don\u2019t think anyone is hurt. I know it\u2019s a fool\u2019s response, but I can\u2019t help myself: there is a ring of people gathered around Potter, and I push my way to the centre. I wonder who saw. Do all these people know? I have to fight a mad urge to turn and run. Potter\u2019s rocking back on his knees, panting through the familiar aftermath of the collar\u2019s thrall. He squints up at me and pulls what I think is intended to be a wry face. A sort of <em>Oh shit, what now?</em> face.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the confusion, no-one noticed exactly what happened... There\u2019s another creak from the statues and several people stagger back in alarm. Then I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn to see Rivett behind me, his eyebrows drawn together.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy office. Immediately,\u201d he says, and my heart slumps, sick and heavy in my chest.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t face the questioning. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s going to come out, and it\u2019s just a matter of doing it in the way that\u2019s least painful and mortifying. So I tell Rivett everything. Well, no. That\u2019s not true. I don\u2019t tell him about Potter\u2019s little extracurricular visit to my house. I don\u2019t tell him about the sheer fucking eroticism of having Potter shuddering when I speak.</p>\n<p>I give him... selected information. And Rivett hits the roof, just as I knew he would. How dare I withhold information from the Aurors? How dare I withhold information from <em>him</em>? And \u2014 almost worse \u2014 how could I <em>disappoint</em> him like this?</p>\n<p>After a while he calms down, of course. He rubs a hand across his face and closes his eyes for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at it this way.\u201d He leans across the desk towards me, his face grim. \u201cWe have a young Curse-Breaker in the department. He used to be a Death Eater. Everyone knows this. But we stand by him, not least because he aces the aptitude tests. He checks out well enough under Occlumency, too. But he\u2019s been out of training for less than a year when he goes to a Nox Anima stronghold with Harry fucking Potter. The two of them are alone there for a couple of hours, and when they come back, Potter\u2019s got a magical collar around his neck which he says he \u201cjust felt like trying on\", and what it does \u2014 what it apparently does \u2014 is give him the thrill of his life when this particular Breaker gives him an order. And no fucker can get it off him.\u201d</p>\n<p>I see his point, of course. In fact... for a moment I wonder if I did actually plant the collar there for Potter to find. Whether I might have influenced him to put the bloody thing on. Stranger things have happened. There was a Senior Breaker a couple of years ago, Jeremiah Falkirk. Never committed a crime in his life, upstanding moral character, all of that shit. He was working at a site \u2014 some seriously screwed up stuff there \u2014 and the next thing you know, he\u2019s gone home from work and murdered his father and his sister. He couldn\u2019t remember a thing afterwards, cried like a baby when he heard what he\u2019d done. Salazar only knows what evil was in that place. The Ministry destroyed the whole site in the end and sealed the wreckage under a layer of spells; they couldn\u2019t risk anyone else going in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI... look.\u201d I put my hand palm up on the desk and look Rivett in the eye. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t believe I had anything to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, his face sombre. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound so sure as you did last time, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just remembering Falkirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence as this sinks in. Falkirk\u2019s still in the Janus Thickey ward, as far as I know.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Rivett eventually. \u201cBut Robards is going to have my neck on the block for this. I implore you, Malfoy, if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019re keeping to yourself... don\u2019t let me find out in front of a crowd of gawping quillpushers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No, nothing else. Only that something in Potter calls to me like a lodestone draws an iron nail.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>He takes his glasses off and rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t know what Robards and his lot will have in store for you. All I ask is that you co-operate fully.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Malfoy... I wouldn\u2019t like to be in your shoes.\"</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0~***~</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable prickle of monitoring spells hangs in the air. I look at Potter, trying to keep my face dispassionate. He\u2019s sitting on a hospital bed, wearing loose white patient\u2019s robes with bare feet and hairy calves sticking out of the bottom, and the collar glinting brazenly around his uncovered throat. Granger runs her wand a couple of inches above his legs in a slow, methodical motion.</p>\n<p>I can see how tense and restless he is from his the set of his shoulders, but he catches my eye and pulls a little face that I assume is meant to be conspiratorial. Granger\u2019s too focused on her spellwork to notice, but Theo sees, his eyes darting from me to Potter with an appraising look. Granger\u2019s results don\u2019t satisfy her, judging by her frown, and she runs her wand back over a section of Potter\u2019s spine again, and then again.</p>\n<p>Potter wrinkles his nose at me over her shoulder. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mouths.</p>\n<p>Merlin. That disarming smile, that murmured <em>sorry</em>. How is Potter always so blasted heroic? We\u2019ve been here for over half an hour while he gets layered up to the eyeballs in monitoring spells, though it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s hard for him to sit still, let alone submit to this boring and intrusive process. It\u2019s painful to watch, frankly. But in the middle of all this, he\u2019s still thinking about other people, the bloody fool.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t get the reading on your skeletal system,\u201d Granger tells him. \u201cAh. Got it. Yes.\u201d She makes a note and tucks the piece of parchment into Potter\u2019s bulging medical file. I can\u2019t deny I\u2019m intrigued about what else is in there, but Granger takes out a quill \u2014 lime-green to match her robes \u2014 from her desk drawer and fiddles with it for a moment. She mutters a couple of phrases before leaving it poised over a long scroll of parchment, and after a moment it begins to move by itself. \u201cRight.\u201d Granger nods at Theo. \u201cI\u2019m done. The Medi-Quill will record Harry\u2019s stats for us. Do you want to check that the shield spells have held before we begin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo gestures with his wand, but it\u2019s just for form\u2019s sake. When he shields something, it stays shielded. \u201cAll in place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Granger rifles through Potter\u2019s file before finding the sheet she\u2019s looking for. Then she turns to me and takes a deep breath. \u201cWell, Breaker Malfoy. We need you to try a few things for us today.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can see tension shadowing Potter\u2019s face. I try not to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand that Harry has been experiencing certain... effects since wearing the collar.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it appears to be connected to you. To your voice.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen this happens, do you yourself experience anything out of the ordinary?\u201d</p>\n<p>I keep my face completely still.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor instance... do you have any unexpected physical symptoms?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Merlin\u2019s balls</em>. Perhaps I can play for time. \u201cDefine <em>unexpected</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raises her eyebrows. \u201cAh. Perhaps you could describe the symptoms that you <em>do</em> have.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Damn</em>. \u201cWell. It\u2019s a little alarming, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d I dodge.</p>\n<p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure if I can. I haven\u2019t seen it myself. But obviously that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re hoping to observe today.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>. I knew it was coming, of course. But to hear it confirmed makes a cold squirm of discomfort twist in my stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019d appreciate anything you can tell me,\u201d she presses. \u201cIt could be important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would say that it makes me rather anxious.\u201d <em>That\u2019s not the half of it</em>. \u201cPotter looks as if he\u2019s... ah, well. It\u2019s hard to describe.\u201d <em>He looks like he\u2019s having the best sex of his life, actually, Granger. So you can put that on your little chart</em>. \u201cBut, yes. It makes me feel worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t help glancing at Potter while she makes a note. He\u2019s staring at a spot on the floor.</p>\n<p>Theo leans forward. \u201cWould you say that you feel any connection with Potter while this is going on? Either mental or physical?\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t miss the quick glance that Potter gives me before returning his attention to the floor. \u201cNo.\u201d <em>Just the intimacy that comes from watching someone have a really, really good time</em>.</p>\n<p>Granger turns back to Potter, quill in hand. \u201cAnd you said that you get some warning that it\u2019s about to begin? How far in advance would you say that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cA few seconds? It depends whether I go along with it straight away or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you clarify that: <em>go along with it</em>? What does that entail?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter frowns at his own bare feet. I can see why. My god, even his toes are hairy. \u201cFirst it feels warm. The collar, that is. Then the heat radiates out. The skin on my throat gets tingly, and then it starts to spread, and I get this really strong feeling that if I just do what Malfoy says...\u201d His forehead creases. \u201cWell. That it\u2019s going to be amazing. So I do it.\u201d The tiniest smile pulls at his mouth.</p>\n<p>Granger looks as if a bad smell has just wafted under her nose. \u201cAnd what happens if he says something that you don\u2019t want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter brings his head up. \u201cBut he never does.\u201d He looks as though he finds the question offensive.</p>\n<p>Granger gives him a long look, then writes some more, the quill moving rapidly along. \u201cI\u2019d like to do a basic reading on you, Malfoy, before we begin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d I don\u2019t try to keep the sarcasm out of my voice.</p>\n<p>She puts the parchment down. \u201cAre you taking any Potions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny Spell Damage during the last twenty-eight days?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cut myself shaving yesterday. Is that the sort of thing you\u2019re interested in?\u201d I can see Potter smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny trouble with mood swings? Difficulty sleeping?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yes, but it\u2019s none of your business.</em> \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>She approaches, wand in hand. \u201cJust a light monitoring spell, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t ask what happens if it isn\u2019t all right with me. Her magic rustles over my skin. It feels officious and I resist the urge to brush it away. I remind myself: she\u2019s just doing her job.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour heart rate is elevated.\u201d</p>\n<p>I give a humourless smile. \u201cLime-green robes syndrome, I expect.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cTemperature normal. Breathing... a little on the fast side. OK.\u201d She makes an arc with her wand. \u201cWe\u2019ll take those as a baseline for now, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo\u2019s scribbling away in the scruffy notebook he carries everywhere, black spiderlegs scrawling across the pages. His face is so bored-looking, it gives no clue as to whether he\u2019s making a note of my allegedly excitable heart rate or writing a shopping list for his supper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to begin,\u201d Granger tells Theo. \u201cCan you stand by? In case...\u201d She gestures towards the collar, in clear view around Potter\u2019s neck. It glints as he shifts his head with a restless motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The hand holding his wand looks relaxed, but his eyes are trained on Potter\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry. Tell us if you need to stop at any point. If you feel unfamiliar changes in the collar. Or if it physically becomes too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s eyes flick to mine. He looks... unsettled, would be the best word, but his jaw is set in a determined line.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy. Can you give Harry a simple instruction? For instance, tell him to raise his hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo lowers his wand for a moment. \u201cIt would be useful from my point of view to try a control first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She turns to Potter. \u201cReady?\u201d He nods. \u201cPlease raise your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to actually do it, or...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you feel any urge to comply?\u201d Granger asks him.</p>\n<p>He grins. \u201cOnly because you asked so nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it make a difference how Malfoy asks you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His eyes flick to me again. \u201cHe\u2019s usually a bit crosser than that, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stifle the urge to snort.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaise your hand,\u201d she tells Harry, more sharply this time. We all wait, but Potter doesn\u2019t move. \u201cAnything?\u201d she asks him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a thing. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks at Theo. \u201cEnough for the time being? OK. Malfoy. Could you please ask Harry the same question?\u201d</p>\n<p>I curl my lip. \u201cPolitely, or...?\u201d</p>\n<p>She makes an impatient gesture. \u201cJust do what comes naturally.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks as if he wants to laugh again, but when I meet his eye, his face becomes serious.</p>\n<p>My mouth is so dry. I half expect Granger\u2019s infernal monitoring spell to start chiming an alarm or something. I take a breath. \u201cRaise your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have a lot of conviction to it, but I can see straight away the effect it has on Potter. The collar seems to glimmer with pearly light, and his face softens to a look of rapt expectation, which rapidly takes on an edge of discomfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say if you wanted me to obey or not,\u201d he tells Granger, his voice a little breathless, and that word, <em>obey</em>... a long, delicious shiver slides eloquently down my spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Well.\u201d Granger thinks about it. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p>\n<p>His lips twitch as if it\u2019s a stupid question. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>His breath hitches even before I see the movement of his arm, as if just the anticipation of it brings him to the edge. His right hand lifts to his ear and his eyes close and he\u2019s \u2014 god, I can see he\u2019s trying to suppress it, but it still looks pretty powerful. His chest swells and his left hand clenches into a fist on his thigh. A soft, profound sigh escapes from his lips and his right hand falls back to his lap.</p>\n<p>Granger looks concerned, but she waits until Potter opens his eyes to speak. \u201cWas that about normal?\u201d</p>\n<p>He has that slightly sleepy look on his face. \u201cA bit less than normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo scrawls a quick note. I crane my head but I can\u2019t make out the words from this angle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right to continue?\u201d Granger asks.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s eyes flick over to me. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, please, Malfoy. The same instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRaise your hand.\u201d I say quickly. Perhaps we can get this over with. Perhaps it won\u2019t be so bad.</p>\n<p>The collar shimmers, Potter\u2019s hand lifts and this time it\u2019s an outright moan that emerges from his mouth. I turn my eyes from him, but I can\u2019t avoid seeing Theo\u2019s eyebrows go up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain.\u201d Granger is a frightful harridan.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaise your hand.\u201d If I say it quietly, perhaps Potter won\u2019t hear, but it makes no difference. I don\u2019t look at him. It\u2019s enough to have his groans ringing in my ears. To see Granger\u2019s pink, anxious face.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter.\u201d Theo\u2019s voice is clear and firm. \u201cDescribe what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>I risk a look. Potter\u2019s eyelids are drooping, his face still semi-blissed out. \u201cUhhh.\u201d He runs his tongue over dry lips. \u201cUh. Really good. Feels really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Granger asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn every way.\u201d Potter smiles beatifically.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it the same every time?\u201d Theo asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHahhh.\u201d Potter lets out a long breath. \u201cFunny you should ask. It\u2019s not quite as good this time. It\u2019s not so good as when it\u2019s just me and Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I feel a rush of blood to my cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s still pretty damn good,\u201d Potter tells us all and, fuck, I could happily hex him right now.</p>\n<p>Theo\u2019s trying to catch my eye but I can\u2019t look at him. I know he\u2019s taking in my flushed face. I wipe a hand over my forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does it only happen with Malfoy?\u201d Granger asks Theo.</p>\n<p>Theo wrinkles his nose. \u201cSeems likely that it imprinted on him when Potter put the collar on. Draco just happened to be there. Unless...\u201d He turns to Potter. \u201cOne question \u2014 purely in the interests of understanding how this works. Are you attracted to men or women?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as if I haven\u2019t wondered about this myself. But I didn\u2019t want to find out like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is that relevant?\u201d Granger asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know whether Auror Potter usually associates this type of physical gratification with males or females.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s jaw juts. \u201cEr. Both,\u201d and a frisson of interest shivers across my skin.</p>\n<p>Theo makes a note. \u201cSometimes these spells are a bit choosy. Let\u2019s see if it will work for me. Raise your hand, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>We all watch, but Potter doesn\u2019t react. \u201cNo.\u201d Theo scribbles in his notebook again. \u201cMy guess is that it\u2019s just Draco, then. Draco was the first person that Potter saw after he put the collar on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course I was. There\u2019s nothing more to this. There\u2019s no genuine connection between us. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong fucking time, as usual.</p>\n<p>Granger is leaning over the Medi-Quill, and Merlin, I hope that thing\u2019s not recording my heartrate as well. \u201cPulse 98 and falling. Are you OK to continue, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, the traitor.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you describe where you feel the sensations?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks a little red in the face. \u201cUh. If you want.\u201d His eyes dart to me before he continues. \u201cWell, it starts around the collar, as I said. Like a rush of heat. And if I do what Malfoy says, it spreads... down to my chest, at first.\u201d He shifts in his seat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it help if you described it while it was happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks... fuck, he looks <em>shy</em>, and it makes something stutter inside me. \u201cUh, I can\u2019t really talk much while it\u2019s happening. You could probably tell that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more information you can give us, the more likely we\u2019ll be able to find a solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>He squares his shoulders a little. \u201cOK, it travels sort of everywhere. It feels warm at first, and then it\u2019s like\u2014 It\u2019s like pure, er, I don\u2019t know. Like a pure essence of pleasure. I feel it everywhere. In my veins. My skin. Sometimes I feel it in my <em>hair</em>. He stops to snort at that. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big wave of it. It feels like it\u2019s crashing over me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo whistles. \u201cWhere can I get something like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter smiles. \u201cYeah. Except, sometimes... \u201c His eyes stray across to mine again. \u201cSometimes it feels like I might not be able to bear it. Like it\u2019s too much. Then it starts to ebb away. And afterwards... that feels pretty wonderful, too.\u201d His eyes run over my face. I can feel a trickle of sweat in between my shoulder blades. And Potter\u2019s eyes are full of heat, and such a vivid green behind his glasses, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Granger clears her throat. \u201cRight. I think we\u2019ve got that covered. So. Resuming the test. Again, please, Breaker Malfoy. And this time, something different.\u201d</p>\n<p>I feel a rush of annoyance. I\u2019m not a performing Crup. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Potter to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d suggests Theo.</p>\n<p>Several very inappropriate things instantly pop into my mind. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks wary, as well he might.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him to dance?\u201d Granger suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thanks a bunch.\u201d Potter scowls at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not using this to humiliate him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looks at me, his eyes softening. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, Malfoy. I can resist it. Remember?\u201d he tells me quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still not doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou state that you can resist it.\u201d Theo tells Potter. \u201cBut we only saw you do that for a few seconds. Are you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger is flicking through his file with a pinched expression. \u201cWhen did this happen? At the Lafarge house?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter and I exchange looks, but I don\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2014 There was another time,\u201d Potter says. Something unspoken travels between him and Granger.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silence. I can see Theo looking at me quizzically, but after another moment, Granger moves on. \u201cOK. Look, tell Harry to get up and walk around. And Harry, you try to stay where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter grips the edge of the bed in readiness, and then, when I speak, he closes his eyes tightly. \u201c<em>Mmf</em>,\u201d is the only sound he makes. I know I could ramp it up, really make him squirm, but I stay silent, and Granger, thank goodness, doesn\u2019t prompt me to say anything more.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe collar\u2019s moving,\u201d Theo observes, and it\u2019s true, it appears to be flexing, very subtly, around his neck, like a snake coiling, wrapping itself around a victim.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that hurt?\u201d Granger asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot\u2014 the collar\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s just sort of\u2026 reminding me.\u201d Potter grits his teeth for a moment. \u201cIt just feels \u2013 <em>uh</em> \u2013 rather uncomfortable. To ignore Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPulse 108. Indicative of stress,\u201d Granger notes. \u201cWhere? Where is the discomfort?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s passing now. Give me a moment.\u201d We watch him take a couple of deep breaths. \u201cIt was... around my temples. In my chest. And just... all over my skin. Like an itch.\u201d He rubs at his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat lasted around a minute and a half,\u201d Theo points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what he says again this time,\" Granger tells Potter. She turns to me. \u201cTell him to say something. Tell him to say your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>I could tell him, \u201cSay my name.\u201d That\u2019s what Granger means, and if I do, I\u2019m sure Potter will oblige and say, \u201cMalfoy,\u201d for me, as easy as pie. But somehow... somehow, between my brain and my lips, the order translates into something different. \u201cSay <em>Draco</em>,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>I regret it as soon as I\u2019ve said it, but then that look, soft and happy and thrilled comes over his face again, that look of anticipation and delight, and \u201cDraco,\u201d he says, quiet and shy, the <em>O</em> sound lengthening into a moan, and he drops his head down, panting through it, his shoulders quivering beneath the thin hospital gown.</p>\n<p>\u201cPulse 112,\u201d Granger says. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t be so foolish twice. \u201cSay my name,\u201d I tell him, but the reply comes back, \u201cDraco,\u201d once more; this time, a breathy exhalation, his hands clenching in the bedsheet, his face contorted, eyes shut tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Theo says quietly to me, while Potter makes a low crooning sound. \u201cHe really gets off on this.\u201d He sounds amused, the bastard, and I feel like throttling him. Nothing about this is funny, for god\u2019s sake. Potter\u2019s chest is heaving, and his hair is sticking to his face, and \u201c117,\u201d says Granger, and I could throttle her, too.</p>\n<p>Potter looks up, his eyes unfocused but still a brilliant green. \u201cDo we have to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Granger says, but she sounds unsure.</p>\n<p>I do as she asks, the words flat on my lips. Potter, however, makes my name sound like poetry. He sighs it out, his voice shaking with pleasure. \u201cDraco.\u201d His whole body shudders and he says it again without prompting, \u201c<em>Draco</em>.\u201d His eyes open. Latch onto mine. I can\u2019t swallow. Can\u2019t breathe without an ache catching in my chest. Potter sounds <em>rapturous</em> and I think about how it might feel to hear him say it of his own free will. Somewhere quiet, private. Without Granger and Nott watching and gawping.</p>\n<p>Anger rises up in my throat, hot and fierce, at the thought of them seeing this, seeing Potter so exposed. How dare they watch him like this? And still Potter moans on, apparently beyond caring, past the point at which he can stop. \u201cOh, god. <em>Ahhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough,\u201d Granger says, her face screwed up. \u201c129. Oh, Harry, stop now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does that heart rate compare with someone having sex?\u201d Theo asks, and I\u2019ve changed my mind \u2014 throttling is too good for him. I concentrate instead on sending a wordless hex in his direction; I seem to remember a great one we used to use after lights out in the Slytherin dorm, but he just keeps talking. \u201cI\u2019m only curious, you understand,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>Granger\u2019s lips are pursed. \u201cLet\u2019s keep the questions professional, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo turns to wink at me and then, I don\u2019t know, something about my appearance seems to catch his attention and I see his bloody appraising eye sweep over me. He takes in every inch of me, and even though I look away, I\u2019m damned if I can hide all that I\u2019m feeling.</p>\n<p>Granger is still frowning at her bloody chart, thank god, and hasn\u2019t noticed a thing. Potter\u2019s eyes are closed, his head hanging down. I stare determinedly at a poster on the wall. <em>Don\u2019t Drink and Apparate. We treat dozens of Splinchings each year at St Mungo\u2019s. Don\u2019t be one of them!</em>. For a minute I think Theo will keep quiet and then he clears his throat, \u201cI must say, seeing this in action certainly sheds new light on the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, definitely.\u201d Theo nods. \u201cFor instance, I didn\u2019t realise it wasn\u2019t just Potter who was affected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger looks up. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. Potter\u2019s looking half-stunned after his last bout with the collar. Perhaps he didn\u2019t hear. I shoot a warning look at Theo. He should fucking watch his back. Having a psychopath in your house for a year, you learn a thing or two; I haven\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Theo continues airily. \u201cYou must have noticed. It\u2019s having quite the effect on Draco, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Granger\u2019s voice rises as she snaps her head back to look at the chart again. \u201c107!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d Theo arches an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d She points. \u201cThis line here is Malfoy. 107. That\u2019s ridiculously high for someone just sitting in a chair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo makes a note in his blasted book. Potter\u2019s eyes are still closed. Oh, god, I pray he hasn\u2019t heard. I consider blasting Granger\u2019s scroll out of existence.</p>\n<p>Granger\u2019s bending over to scrutinise it. \u201cIn fact, your pulse rate is all over the place, Malfoy \u2014 my god, look at this, Theo \u2014 his breathing, here and especially <em>here</em>, when Potter was in the middle of the worst of it, and... \u201c</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s coming out of it, his eyes fluttering open. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this any more,\u201d he says, as firmly as he\u2019s able, but Granger\u2019s attention is all on me now, her wand arm extending towards me.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy. Let me just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d I bark it out and she flinches back. But I refuse to go along with this any more. Rivett can sack me if he wants to. I think of just walking out, but who knows what they\u2019d find to do to Potter after I left.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d Potter says, his voice stronger now. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t want to sit here and say my name, pant it out like a lover would at a moment of ecstasy. He doesn\u2019t want my voice to be the thing that makes his breath stutter, makes his face twist into that look of tortured sweetness.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you got your readings?\u201d I snap.</p>\n<p>Granger and I both look at the scroll, the quill still moving of its own accord. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve done quite enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger looks taken aback. \u201cI\u2014 Well, no. I need more time. It\u2019s important that we understand\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you understand that Potter is not some specimen to be prodded and poked and made to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns to Potter. \u201cHarry. I know it\u2019s a nuisance, but we need to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>I butt in. \u201cI withdraw my consent for the tests. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get very far without me here to set him off, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo\u2019s watching, his eyes amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry needs you to co-operate.\" Granger smooths back a section of hair which has come loose. \u201cWe can\u2019t get him out of this mess unless you work with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter speaks low and firm. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of testing for today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNott.\u201d Granger looks at him for back-up. \u201cWe\u2019ve hardly started\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve got quite a lot more to go on, now, as it happens. I\u2019d say further observation might be useful in the future, but observing the collar in action was the main aspect of what I needed. If I could just go over the charts with you before I leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger waves a hand in exasperation. \u201cAm I the only one who thinks it would be senseless to stop just when we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>I stand up. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be signing Potter off for the rest of the day. I expect he could do with a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter puts up a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just give me a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger seems to look at him properly for the first time; he looks confused and unhappy. She bites her lip. \u201cActually... he\u2019s right, Harry. You may feel depleted. Some time to rest would be a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll they let me do these days is sit at my desk anyway,\u201d he says bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI insist,\u201d she says, and another look passes between them before Potter gets to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m pretty much desperate to get out of these robes,\u201d he tells her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Granger says. \u201cHold still while I remove the monitoring spells.\u201d She slashes her wand in the air a number of times. \u201cYou can get dressed next door.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as Potter\u2019s left, Granger speaks, low and insistent. \u201cThis is dangerous for him, Breaker Malfoy. These Curses can be very unpredictable. You have no idea what effects it\u2019s having on his system, and I also need to check what\u2019s going on with you while the collar is working on him. We had no clue you were affected by it too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo looks up from his jottings. \u201cAre your results definitely an effect of the collar, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what else would it be?\u201d Granger asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooked to me like Draco simply enjoys watching Potter when he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Theo!\u201d I snarl.</p>\n<p>His smirk is the most annoying thing I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cJust a thought. And while we\u2019re on the subject, Draco... have you and Potter ever...? \u201c His arched eyebrow finishes the question for him.</p>\n<p>Granger flushes again. \u201cI thought we agreed to keep the questions professional?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s highly relevant.\u201d Theo twirls his quill between his fingers. \u201cNow I\u2019ve seen it in action, I suspect the collar was designed to be used between, well. Consenting couples.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger looks appalled. \u201cCouples don\u2019t use curses on one another!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced now that it\u2019s a curse at work at all. I never have been able to test it to my satisfaction, because it happens to be around Auror Potter\u2019s throat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s warped! What else could it be but a curse? Harry can\u2019t take it off. He\u2019s got no choice about how it affects him, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo narrows his eyes. \u201cConsider this: would you say he seemed to be suffering while it was in use?\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger draws a furious breath as if to speak, then seems to deflate suddenly. Instead she glares at Theo before turning back to the scroll of results, her shoulders stiff under her green robes.</p>\n<p>This seems the perfect moment to leave, but Theo taps his notebook with his quill.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Draco, you didn\u2019t answer my question. Have you ever...?\u201d</p>\n<p>I keep my face as expressionless as I can, ignore the heat I can feel around my cheeks. \u201cMe and Potter?\u201d I try to curl my lip a little. \u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p>\n<p>Theo gives me that blasted appraising look before scratching another note, and I long to rip the book from his hands and tear it to pieces.</p>\n<p>The door opens and Potter walks in wearing his Auror uniform. He\u2019s all buttoned up, his tunic pristine, his boots polished, but his hair looks like he\u2019s just gone five rounds in a duel. \u201cWe\u2019re finished?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have several more questions,\u201d Granger tells him, but Potter just shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough for today, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as we\u2019re outside the door, Potter grimaces. \u201cFuck. That was... Well. Pretty bad. Thank you. For what you said about stopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll let him see that I care about any of it. \u201cWell. I\u2019m sure this is not pleasant for you. I can see that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives a little frown, then his expression changes. \u201cWell, actually, there are compensations. In fact...\u201d He hesitates, then tilts his chin up. \u201cDo you have time for a drink? I appear to have the rest of the day to myself.\u201d His smile is disarming. But still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to\u2014\u201d I wave my arm. \u201cGet back. To the Ministry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He touches my arm lightly, just for a second. I can feel the warmth of his fingers through my robes. \u201cI really wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>He heard what they said. I knew it. He wasn\u2019t that out of it. He probably saw my reactions, too. Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>. And it\u2019s all there, on Granger\u2019s scroll, and in Nott\u2019s notebook, and they\u2019ll get together and have a cosy chat about it, no doubt, and then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d I turn away.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy,\u201d he calls, but I\u2019m already walking, fast and unwavering, towards the stairs, and when I get there, I hurry down, taking them two at a time.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>When the knock comes at the door, it\u2019s not really a surprise. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t half-expecting it. I could have gone out. I could have cloaked the door in an Imperturbable Charm and gone to bed. But I chose not to. I chose to be in, to leave the wards down low. To open a bottle of wine and drink enough of the way down it that my judgement is skewed, so that when I open the door and find Potter there, looking windswept and breathless, the air around him bristling with some weird energy, I step back and let him in without a word.</p>\n<p>He steps in and there\u2019s not enough room in my hallway. He\u2019s too close, too real, always too <em>much</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask, and my voice sounds odd and parched.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really need to talk to you, Malfoy,\u201d he says, and he steps even closer, and I back away to the sitting room, watching him follow me, his shirt open at the throat and the collar winking at me all the way.</p>\n<p>I offer him a drink and refill my own glass. I throw the wine down my throat as if it will quench whatever\u2019s inside me.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout today,\u201d he begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d I run a hand over my face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we need to.\u201d His eyebrows draw together. \u201cIt really fucking bothered me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I pour more wine, splashing some on the table. \u201cDid you come here just to tell me how repulsive this is for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat? No. Who said anything about repulsive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Distasteful, then. I can imagine being bound to someone like this is bad enough. The fact that it\u2019s me...\u201d I don\u2019t need to finish. The wine tastes suddenly sour, tainted by self-pity.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy. Stop being an arse. I saw how you reacted.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t even look at him. Instead I look at a crystal vase on the mantelpiece. I could shatter it into a thousand shards with a word. It would be so easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy.\u201d His voice is urgent. \u201cGod, haven\u2019t you been thinking about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>I let my voice drip with disdain. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout this. <em>Us</em>. Fuck, I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>I turn my head back. He\u2019s leaning forward in the armchair. I don\u2019t know how to describe the way he\u2019s looking at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason today was so difficult was because I\u2019ve thought about being like that with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making the least bit of sense.\u201d I\u2019m dizzy. Too much bloody wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about saying your name that way. Merlin, yes. But I never wanted it to be like that. In a hospital room, with people watching us.\u201d His hand makes a fist on his thigh. \u201cGod, I wish... I wish I\u2019d come to you again sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome to me... why?\u201d My voice is tight with disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Malfoy. Think about it. What it would be like. Not just <em>sit down</em>, and <em>raise your hand</em>, and all that shit.\u201d He drops his voice lower. \u201cCan\u2019t you think of anything else you\u2019d rather have me do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d I want another drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, Malfoy, if you want me to spell it out: I\u2019d do anything you tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I <em>desperately</em> want another drink, but my hands are shaking too much to pour it. \u201cI would never take advantage,\u201d I tell him. I wouldn\u2019t. I <em>wouldn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake advantage?\u201d His face is fierce. \u201cHell, I want it. I\u2019ve been <em>dreaming</em> of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong. The collar\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck the collar. I don\u2019t care about that. I want this, Malfoy. I want to go down on my knees again for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>My body responds with a shocking spike of arousal, and I\u2019m pretty sure he sees.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to fuck me, and I\u2019m sick of pretending otherwise,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>The way he looks, sitting there, fizzing with need, his shirt tight across his chest, the cold metal glinting against his throat, and those words on his lips. He has no fucking idea how close he has me to losing control. A wave of fury rises up and I snarl the words out. \u201cOK. You want it. Well, how about this? How about if I wanted you to do those things because you wanted <em>me</em>?\u201d I feel my face twist in self-loathing. \u201cNot because you want the thrills the collar brings you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanker. It\u2019s you I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>I grimace. \u201cYes, because when I speak, the collar\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>, not that.\u201d His voice is harsh with frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for god knows how long. Why do you think I always swung it so that I could be your escort when you were working in the field?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was <em>you</em>?\u201d This is beyond belief.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. I sweet-talk Doris \u2014 the witch who does the rotas \u2014 almost daily. You\u2019re such a hard nut to crack, though. All buttoned up, with your protocols and your paperwork, never any time for a little bit of banter...\u201d A smile threatens to sneak across his face. \u201cI\u2019d decided you were immune to my attempts at bad flirting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter\u2014 you\u2014 you drive me fucking insane! Distracting me all of the time. We could both get killed, you imbecile!\u201d</p>\n<p>And now he does smile, slow and heated. \u201cAh, Malfoy. Don\u2019t you think danger can be a bit of a turn on?\u201d</p>\n<p>There are no words.</p>\n<p>He leans forwards again. \u201cListen.\u201d As if I could do anything else with him looking like that. Saying these things. \u201cYou know what they said? About how the collar connected with you because you happened to be there?\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if that wasn\u2019t it? What if it was designed to bond with the person that the wearer desired most?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d This could all be part of the collar\u2019s power. To make him think... to make him really <em>believe</em> that he\u2019s attracted to me. That he has been for some time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But it could well be.\u201d He shuts his eyes for a moment. \u201cOK. This is the truth. Before this happened... \u201c He touches his throat and my eyes are drawn to the narrow band which encircles his neck so perfectly. \u201cI was wondering whether I should have a bit of dignity and give up on you. But now...\u201d He reaches for his wine and takes a draught, his tongue swiping across his top lip to catch a stray drop. \u201cCan you honestly tell me that you\u2019re not interested?\u201d</p>\n<p>My mouth is so dry I\u2019m not sure I can answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me. Am I fooling myself about what I think I\u2019ve seen? Tell me I am, and I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p>\n<p>My voice sounds like it\u2019s cracked from disuse. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes are burning into me.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not wrong,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>He scrambles across the few feet separating us so that he\u2019s crouching on the floor in front of my chair. \u201cHell, Malfoy. <em>Draco</em>... please...\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t take any more. He\u2019s at my feet, begging me, his face tilted up expectantly and his eyes blazing with heat. I kiss him, opening his lips with my tongue, and he groans into my mouth. My hands run over the muscles of his back, and I feel the heat of his body through his shirt. And I want him. I want him so badly. I want to have him right here, to throw him down on the floor and leave him in no doubt about how much I ache to possess him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh... please,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cOh, god, tell me what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>I remember what he said before about the collar\u2019s nagging demands. \u201cIt\u2019s bothering you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. I just... uhh. It would be so good. Wouldn\u2019t it? You know it would.\u201d</p>\n<p>My imagination supplies the proof of this in vivid detail. Potter, naked and kneeling, my cock nudging between his lips. Potter, spread-eagled on my bed. On his stomach. His arse open and ready for me, his body shivering at my command, moaning with gratification every time I speak...</p>\n<p>I close my eyes at the intense wave of desire running through me. How can it hurt just to try? Just a little bit.</p>\n<p>He wants it so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d I say, and before I can press my lips to his, he\u2019s crying out, his body arching towards me, hands clenching in my robes. I kiss him, feel his body shake as the peak hits him and I go deeper, crushing my lips against him. The collar is pulsing between us like a living thing, reminding me of its power. Of <em>my</em> power. And he gasps and twitches in my arms and I forget to care about what is right.</p>\n<p>I let myself do what I want \u2014 and I want everything. I take my fill of his mouth until he\u2019s too unsteady to kneel any more, and then I lay him down on the floor instead. He\u2019s so perfect like this, all wanting and needy and fierce and he does everything I tell him, everything. His shirt is undone now, his flesh mine to touch, to taste. I tell him to undo my robes and his fingers tremble so much that I have to tell him again and again, and he moans and curses more each time until I laugh and do it for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he begs. \u201cOh, god, fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hair is all over his face, his breath coming fast and desperate. Blood is rushing in my ears. I could take him right now. He wants it so much. And he\u2019d fall apart so beautifully. I can imagine his cries ringing in my ears; I picture myself spilling deep inside him, holding nothing back, and damn it, I\u2019m certain his arse is just as hot and sweet as his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, holy fuck, Draco, please. For the love of Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d The words are hollow and final. I just can\u2019t do it. Fuck, I can\u2019t be that person any more. I know what he says... but what if they <em>do</em> find a way to break the enchantment and then he regrets it? How can he consent \u2014 <em>really</em> consent \u2014 when he\u2019s under the power of the collar? What if his supposed attraction to me is just part of the whole sickening deception?</p>\n<p>I think again of that twisted bastard, Lafarge, and a cold, sick shiver creeps down the back of my neck. He\u2019d love this, wouldn\u2019t he? Harry Potter, half-naked and so drunk with lust that he hardly knows what he\u2019s saying. Trembling and whining for my cock. I curse under my breath and when that\u2019s not nearly enough, aloud, pure loathing in my voice. \u201cFuck you, Lafarge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Potter\u2019s voice is edged with misery.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Potter. If I were to have you \u2014 and you have to believe me, there is nothing more in life that I want at this moment. If I ever do, I want it to have nothing to do with that evil fucker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to do with him.\u201d Potter\u2019s face is a picture of misery and confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with <em>us</em>. Damn it, listen to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>I shake my head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019ve got <em>that</em> on.\u201d I flick my fingers contemptuously at the collar. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell and Fiendfyre, Malfoy.\u201d Potter pushes himself up on his elbows to look me in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re actually serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m deadly serious. I can\u2019t do it if there\u2019s a possibility you might regret it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter closes his eyes and shakes his head. \u201cYou stupid, bloody, noble, shitty <em>bastard</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There doesn\u2019t seem any answer to that. I stand up and walk over to the fireplace, and stare at the dregs of wine left in my glass. What I need is a large brandy.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Potter reaches down to adjust himself and I feel a lurch of heat in the pit of my stomach. He leans back against the sofa and sighs. \u201cAnd there was me hoping Slytherins were easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>I want to lay him down again. I want to kiss him, taste the sweet warmth of his mouth pulling me in. I want to feel the length of his body hot and firm alongside mine, his erection rubbing against my hip. I don\u2019t have to fuck him. I could rock against him, line up our cocks. Even through his jeans, through my trousers, it would feel like pure satisfaction, the friction pulling raw sounds from our throats. I could watch him come apart and then... Then he could stay for a nightcap, and wouldn\u2019t he look fine, sitting there sipping my brandy with the firelight flickering on his face. Merlin, how I want him. Surely we could just do that\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d he asks, and the collar seems to ripple against his throat, bright and mutinous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He runs a hand through his hair and sighs. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. I get it. Even if I wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d He touches the rim of the collar, twitches his neck as if the sensation of it bothers him, then gets to his feet. His eyes rest on my face, my lips. The pull towards him is so strong, like a hook in my guts, but I don\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt had better be goodbye, then,\u201d he says, and when I don\u2019t speak, he turns to go. I don\u2019t watch, but instead grope for my wand to Summon the brandy bottle. The door clicks shut behind him. The wards shudder as he leaves, then seal closed around the house again as if Potter had never been there.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>My head aches, a dull, grating pain just over my left temple. I loathe working under pressure like this, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I slept restfully. Whenever I manage to drop off, taunting images fill my dreams, tormenting me until I wake, sodden with sweat.</p>\n<p>They say the whole Lafarge job is taking too long; they want to seal the site and free up Breakers to work in the field again. But they daren\u2019t seal it without knowing what exactly is left in there. There\u2019s a constant stream of objects coming in, and barely enough time to glance at some of them before I need to make a decision. I massage my forehead with one hand while Summoning the next item with the other.</p>\n<p>A pair of gloves \u2014 seems harmless. Strong traces of magical activity, but no more than to be expected with an item worn on the hands. Probably had frequent contact with the owner\u2019s wand. I dismiss them with a flick to the pile marked \u2018safe\u2019.</p>\n<p>I hear someone walk past outside, laughing, and for a split second I think it\u2019s Potter. The only bright spot in this whole work situation is the fact that it leaves me next to no time to think about anything else. Doesn\u2019t stop me dreaming about him at night, though.</p>\n<p>Next. A marble egg. Nothing untoward showing up. However, there could be something hidden inside. Marble is a useful masking agent for certain types of magic... I spin it around, looking for any sign of an opening... Ugh, it could take half an hour to penetrate the thing in a controlled way, and there\u2019s no reason to think there would be anything inside worth the trouble. I send the thing on its way and beckon to the next item with my wand.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a whole pile of books. A shelf-full, in fact, and I know all too well there are more to come. A book. Hmm. Bound in leather, with a hand-drawn cover of runes and sigils, and a distinct whiff of Dark magic coming from it. I sit up a little bit straighter in my seat. My first impression is that it feels like an old Pureblood curse. Things like this are often passed down from generation to generation and not shared outside one\u2019s own family. Fascinating to study. I could happily spend a day teasing apart the tangles of a curse like this, strand by strand. But, of course, there\u2019s no bloody time.</p>\n<p>I rotate the book in mid-air. My best option, if I can\u2019t work it out during the next five minutes, is simply to destroy it within the containment of the lab. I\u2019d have to log that, though, and because it\u2019s a book, there\u2019s always the risk of destroying valuable information. Questions would be asked. I sigh and raise the Cognoscope to my eye.</p>\n<p>Yes. Blue with a shimmer of violet. Nasty. I bet this one has quite a kick to it. I\u2019d sooner not mess with it at all without the time to set some proper containment spells... but I can\u2019t just write off the contents without checking.</p>\n<p>I sit back and squint at it. I don\u2019t need to disarm the entire curse if I can simply find a spot weak enough to let me in for a few seconds. I test it a little bit, only as much as I dare, probing gently around the edges of the spellwork with my mind. Quite a lot of power to it... but rather chaotic. I get the feeling the caster was in a rush, which is handy for me. I fix the eyepiece more firmly against my eye and take up my wand again. It\u2019s pretty impenetrable all the way round this side. I rotate the book another ninety degrees. <em>This</em> section is weak, but it\u2019s right next to a great vicious clump of ... I don\u2019t actually know <em>what</em> that is, but I\u2019m not touching it at all.</p>\n<p>Hmm. I leave the book where it is, and shift my chair to the right to get a better look. I feel like just... under... here... there\u2019s a sort of... <em>ah</em>. Something feels like it's about to give and I back right off and cast some quick Shield Spells. This would go better with two Breakers working on it, one to contain the worst of it if something goes wrong, and one to try and gently prise it open. I know everyone else is just as busy as me, though.</p>\n<p>I take a couple of breaths. My skull feels as if there\u2019s an Erumpent thumping through it. Now, where was that spot? Not here. Not here. Maybe... <em>yes</em>. I slide my magic inside, just a small amount, ready to retreat as soon as I feel any resistance. I feel the seam of the curse loosen and allow me to slip between its edges, and I gently, gently, widen the gap and start to ease my way in. I can\u2019t release the book from the curse, not like this, but if I can hold the weave of the magic open, just enough... I pin the layers apart with my mind and then use my wand... with the gentlest motion, I can riffle the pages of the book without the curse even noticing.</p>\n<p>I peer in, not daring to open it any wider. The writing inside is neat and cramped. I suspect it\u2019s not from the same hand as this rather haphazard curse-work.</p>\n<p><em>Priapus Potion. Warning. Causes unwavering arousal for up to six hours.</em> I raise an eyebrow and turn a few more pages. <em>Engorgio Phallus - a charm to</em>\u2014 Interesting. But I think I get the gist without reading further. There are dates and what looks like account after gloating account of the use of the potions and spells. So, a sort of journal, with recipes for home-brewed sex aids, and a record of the results. Perhaps I\u2019ll flag the book as needing further investigation \u2014 Theo would undoubtedly find the contents amusing. But my hold on the parted edges of the Curse can\u2019t last for much longer. I flutter through the pages once more, just to make sure the rest is more of the same before I contain it and log it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Voluptas Collar.</em>\n</p>\n<p>My heart stutters inside my ribs. There\u2019s a sketch of a collar, a sinuous, twisting thing. <em>This Collar provides irresistible delights for its lucky wearer when\u2014</em>, I read, and, oh, Salazar, the edges of the spell begin to slip out of my hold. My mind scrambles to regain a grip, but the curse snaps shut, eager to protect the secrets of the book. And the little questing tendril of my magic, which I used to lever the spellwork open, is crushed inside as if in a steel trap. My mouth opens, but I\u2019ve no breath left with which to cry out as blackness rushes up and engulfs me.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>The first thing I notice when I wake up is scratchy cotton against my bare feet. The second is the bruised, tender feeling in my ribs every time I breathe in.</p>\n<p>A light flicks on and I screw up my eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Malfoy? Decided to rejoin us in the land of the living, then?\u201d I don\u2019t recognise the voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell happened?\u201d Talking <em>hurts</em>. A stabby sort of shiver in my midriff.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a short, round witch in pale yellow nurse\u2019s robes. She opens the curtains with a fierce twitch. \u201cCurse damage. The Healers will be doing their rounds shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>I remember now. The Curse\u2014 The sickening feeling as it clamped tight around my magic. <em>The book</em>. I push myself up on one arm and wish I hadn\u2019t as the pain increases. \u201cI need to see Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Granger? You\u2019ll be lucky. Healer Lackjoy is dealing with your case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about my case... it\u2019s about Harry Potter.\u201d My breathing feels laboured. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm yourself. Rest is what\u2019s advised at the moment. You can speak to Healer Lackjoy presently. No over-exertion.\u201d</p>\n<p>I flop back against the pillows. I\u2019m an unspeakable idiot. To let myself be distracted like that while I was working. But the fucking book. How much information is in there about the collar? Is there a spell to release it? \u201cI really do need to speak to Healer Granger,\u201d I say, but my voice sounds feeble and the nurse just shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll in good time,\u201d she tells me, sounding a little more sympathetic. \u201cNow, how about a cup of tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>That actually sounds... a bloody marvellous idea. My mouth feels like a Blast-Ended Skrewt shat in it. But first... I look around the room. \u201cWhere\u2019s my wand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime for that soon enough. No magic yet. Healer\u2019s Orders. Tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>No magic? I open my mouth to argue, then think better of it. \u201cI would love some tea, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as she\u2019s out of the room I edge cautiously forwards till I can reach the parchment roll which I can see on the table at the foot of the bed. As I guessed, it contains my notes. I\u2019m so shaky that moving is a bit of a trial, but I ease myself back against the pillows and scan the orderly writing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Unspecified Curse-Damage.... injury sustained while at work... major impact to the patient\u2019s magical core...</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Treatment: Fortificus potion, 2 fl oz every two hours. Invigoration therapy twice daily. Bedrest. Abstinence from all magical activity until core regains 60% strength.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hell. I let myself flop against the pillows. I feel pretty wrecked, to be honest.</p>\n<p>I hear brisk footsteps in the corridor, then Granger\u2019s bushy head of hair appears round the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidently.\"</p>\n<p>Her eyes flick to the notes in my hand. \u201cInteresting reading?\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know why she sounds accusatory. \u201cThey are <em>my</em> notes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are for the benefit of your Healers.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shrug. \u201cThey said my Healer was Lackjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping an eye on things too. For obvious reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>For the reason that you can\u2019t keep your nose out of anything.</em> \u201cMagical depletion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ve suffered from it before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly in training. I was inexperienced, and, well. A Strength-Sapping Curse went off in my face. It felt nothing like this, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t have. Whatever was protecting that book began feeding on your magic, sucking it from you to fortify itself. I\u2019m afraid you were unconscious for quite some time. If Theo hadn\u2019t found you when he did...\u201d</p>\n<p>Something to thank the bastard for when I next see him. \u201cThe book.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Granger inclines her head. \u201cIt took three of them to disarm it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see why the owner would have been keen to keep its secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you read any of it?\u201d She looks disapproving.</p>\n<p>I nod. \u201cSome. I had to try to find out what it was before I destroyed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat collar thing.\u201d Her mouth curls in distaste. \u201cThe details were all in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo... Potter. Is he... Could they...?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods. \u201cHarry\u2019s free.\u201d And I don\u2019t know why something cold and heavy settles in my chest at the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 That\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I say. It sounds flat and unconvincing. I try again. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Potter will be delighted, I\u2019m sure. No more desk duty. No more inconvenient itchy cravings. \u201cDid they find out much about how the thing worked?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Breaker Nott would know. The main thing is that Harry\u2019s OK. No after-effects at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe feels completely normal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. Now, I need to check you over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut... Lackjoy...?\u201d I ask, but I\u2019m no match for a determined Granger at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m between patients, and I have more knowledge about that side of the case. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p>\n<p>I lie back and let her do as she wants, my teeth on edge at the sound of her Medi-Quill scratching on parchment.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. The depletion is more extensive than I\u2019d feared.\u201d As if I couldn\u2019t feel that from the sore, hollow feeling inside me. She consults my notes. \u201cI\u2019m going to increase the dose of Fortificus Potion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her forehead wrinkles. \u201cOh, not for a while.\u201d Something like a smile twitches at her lips. \u201cI hope you like hospital food.\u201d</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know why I thought Potter might visit. I just...</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know. I can see now it was a stupid idea. You do get to thinking all kinds of bloody idiotic things when you\u2019re lying in bed for days on end, that\u2019s all.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>Being back at my place is a huge relief. The warm, rich scent of wood and polish and a fire burning in the grate, instead of astringent herbs and the pervasive stink of Dittany. The softness of fine sheets in my bed. And the delights of a plate of good roast beef and a generous glass of elf-made wine.</p>\n<p>The wine is not strictly allowed under Healer\u2019s orders. But, damn, it slips down like silk, warming me from within, smoothing out the tension I can feel in my shoulders. And Granger will never know.</p>\n<p>By the second evening at home I\u2019m beginning to feel more myself again, although an ill-considered Aguamenti leaves me dizzy and cursing. Even the simplest spells take more effort than I would have believed. But Lackjoy is pleased with my progress, and says another fortnight should see me right.</p>\n<p>The wind is blustering about outside again. It\u2019s natural I would think of the night Potter blew in off the street. He was really quite believable \u2014 that fiery conviction he has. Anyone might have been fooled into thinking that he actually meant what he said.</p>\n<p>I allow myself one glass of brandy and sit brooding over it. When the knock comes, I know I shouldn\u2019t hope, but I do. And there he is, in uniform this time, his face lined with tiredness, a fresh cut standing out livid across one cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d His throat is unfettered, now, of course. Somehow I wasn\u2019t expecting it to look so naked without it. He\u2019s bloody smiling at me, his eyes crinkling and his whole face lit up by it.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to feel this way. Don\u2019t want to feel hope bounding in my chest. It will be worse, afterwards.</p>\n<p>I block the doorway. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds as if the answer should be obvious. \u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why <em>now</em>?\u201d Now, when I\u2019d just about \u2013 not quite, but nearly \u2013 given up.</p>\n<p>He leans heavily against the doorframe. \u201cThey sent me to bloody Peru for two weeks. I just got back. We got the bastards, anyway. Two more members of Nox Anima \u2013 they\u2019d gone to ground there. And a lead on where Lafarge might be hiding.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I should have owled first, I guess? I couldn\u2019t get in touch while I was away. In case it was traced.\u201d His smile starts to falter as I still don\u2019t speak. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p>\n<p>I gesture to his throat. \u201cThey got it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I heard what happened to you with the book.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But it\u2019s amazing that you found it. I would have thanked you sooner, but within an hour of getting it off, they decided I was urgently needed on this mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you came? To thank me?\u201d I don\u2019t want his gratitude.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came because I wanted to see you. But I can go, if...\u201d</p>\n<p>A sudden wave of dizziness has me clutching at the door frame for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell, Malfoy. Are you OK? Should you be lying down?\u201d</p>\n<p>I wave a hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI do need to sit down, though. You\u2019d better come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod, and he stays close to me as we go into the sitting room, as if ready to catch me. He winces as he sits down, and I notice he holds his arm at an odd angle, cradling it across his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done to your arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looks sheepish. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I\u2019ll drop in at St Mungo\u2019s later.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Knut drops. \u201cYou\u2019ve come straight from deployment?\u201d Something is jittering in my chest, but I push it down. I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll let myself get carried away again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. The Ministry first. Had to debrief. Then Ron told me that you were back at home. So here I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, Potter, you need a Healer!\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles a crooked smile. \u201cWell, yeah. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing you do ever makes the slightest bit of sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to see you.\u201d He lowers his head and looks at me from under his fringe. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you. The whole time I was away. Does <em>that</em> make sense?\u201d</p>\n<p>I swallow. It\u2019s so hard not to take him at his word when he looks that way. To remember that someone like him can\u2019t, really <em>can\u2019t</em>, be interested\u2014 \u201cNot really. I thought\u2014\u201d I gesture to his neck. It looks so very pale, and bare.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You thought I wouldn\u2019t feel the same way when the collar was off?\u201d He looks angry. \u201cMerlin, Malfoy, I fucking told you\u2014\u201d He moves, and it must jar his arm, because he clutches it. \u201c<em>Ah</em>. Bugger.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t stop myself wanting it to be true, and my voice shakes. \u201cYou need to get that seen to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a minute. I just had to see if you were all right. How\u2019s your magic doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>I make a face. \u201cWeak as a Kneazle. But they say it\u2019s to be expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you get some rest.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t move, just sits there, looking fierce, suddenly, in his scarlet uniform, until he seems to make up his mind to speak. \u201cMalfoy, just tell me... was I wrong to think about it?\u201d He runs his hand through his hair. \u201cIt kept me going out there, if I\u2019m honest. There were some long nights on stakeout...\u201d He closes his eyes briefly. \u201cBut maybe I got the wrong idea. You\u2019ve had some time to change your mind now.\u201d</p>\n<p>My mouth\u2019s so dry; I\u2019m glad Granger isn\u2019t here to check my pulse. A shaky kind of excitement is swelling inside me. \u201cTo think about...\u201d I need to hear him say it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout you and me. You read that book, right? About how the person wearing the collar chooses who it works with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No. I only saw inside it for a few seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI made them show it to me. <em>The collar provides irresistible delights for its lucky wearer when following the commands of their desired partner</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That</em> was it? The collar works for me because--</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>you</em>, you prick,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou\u2019re my desired partner. And what I can\u2019t stop thinking about is where this will end up.\u201d</p>\n<p>I try to keep my voice light, to hide what this means to me. \u201cWith you in my bed, I\u2019d hope.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to know that an unfamilar elation is flooding, rampant, through my veins.</p>\n<p>His eyes flash and he moves towards me, but then his face twists into a mask of pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, your arm, Potter!\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes some deep breaths. \u201cI know. I guess I do have to go and get it looked at.\u201d There\u2019s a sheen of sweat on his top lip as he stands, cradling his arm. \u201cI just\u2014 Ah, fuck, Malfoy. When will you be well again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that depends. Well enough for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d he says, his voice rough with vexation. \u201cI want you. The same as I did before. I want you <em>inside</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I have a flash of him beneath me, his strong body laid out for my delight, and I swear to Merlin, if it wasn\u2019t for that injured arm, I\u2019d have him right now, and damn my recovery to blazes. My tongue feels thick and clumsy but the words come all the same. \u201cI\u2019m ready whenever you are.\u201d I get to my feet myself, willing my traitorous legs not to shake.</p>\n<p>He looks at me and shakes his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>I make a sound of protest, and he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, you\u2019re still sex on legs. But you\u2019re exhausted, aren\u2019t you? I know how it is. Feels like the Hogwarts Express ran you over.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have the energy to deny it. I let out a discontented sigh instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit,\u201d he tells me. \u201cRest. I\u2019ll go and get myself fixed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>I sink down on the sofa. \u201cUse my Floo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink I will, thanks. Shall I come back? When you\u2019re recovered?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I may have to track you down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll come. Owl me when you\u2019re better. I would come sooner, but...\u201d A smile pulls at his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d He reaches for the Floo Powder, takes a pinch between his fingers. He turns once more, a smile spreading over his face again. \u201cI suppose a quick grope would be a bad idea before I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d I say. \u201cFuck off out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins. \u201cI\u2019m gone.\u201d There\u2019s a brief flash of green in the hearth, and then he\u2019s true to his word.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p><em><em>15th March</em></em><br>\n<em>How\u2019s your arm?</em><br>\n<em> DM</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>All healed.

His mouth is hot and urgent as he presses me up against the cupboard, his hands in my hair, the length of his body firm and insistent against mine.</p>\n<p>Dear, sweet Merlin, he makes me burn for him. I push back against him, my hands making fists in his robes and our mouths rough and needy. He lets out a deep groan and grabs my arse, grinding against me like an overgrown teenager, his hands strong and possessive and\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sound of something being knocked over, and then the tinkle of broken glass. One of Great-Aunt Vega\u2019s crystal goblets is on the floor in pieces.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d Potter mouths against my skin, not pausing in the heady motions of his hips, his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d I tell him. I can feel his erection, solid against my leg as he thrusts. I could come from this. \u201cDo you want this all to be over in a minute?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s kissing my jaw, his stubble scratching against my cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t much care,\u201d he says. \u201cWant you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual, but for Merlin\u2019s sake, Potter, stop now.\u201d I pitch my voice low and firm and he responds, his mouth softening against my skin, his body pliant against mine.</p>\n<p>He leans against the cupboard, one arm on either side of me. He\u2019s breathing hard. Fuck, so am I.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. Sorry.\u201d His eyes run all over my face, lingering on my eyes, my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for quite a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason not to rush it.\u201d My chest feels tight with wanting him. \u201cNow, come and have a drink like civilised people.\u201d I clear up the broken glass with a gesture, then lead him through the hall, the wine floating ahead of us, and two as yet intact glasses bobbing along behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice charmwork.\u201d He\u2019s grinning. \u201cNo more practise spells?\u201d</p>\n<p>I make the glasses do an elegant somersault in mid-air. \u201cNo. I\u2019m officially recovered.\u201d The glasses swoop down onto the table, then each do a small, wobbly, pirouette.</p>\n<p>He snickers. \u201cShow-off.\u201d</p>\n<p>I pour the wine. It\u2019s crisp and clean and, unlike most wine, leaves your head feeling clearer than before.</p>\n<p>Potter takes a swallow. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d He looks so restless, like a ball of energy, his hair especially wayward today. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be back at work on Monday?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>I nod, trying not to show the mixed feelings I have on the matter. I wouldn\u2019t be the first Breaker to get caught out by something nasty. But\u2026 it was bad enough having my loyalty questioned. The last thing I need is anyone doubting my ability to do my job.</p>\n<p>\u201cRivett will be pleased. I hear he keeps griping about how tough it is with you off sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if your lot will keep piling the work on us\u2026 It\u2019s always going to be hard if the team is a Breaker short.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes another drink. \u201cYeah. But not just that. They found some ivory ornament at a farm out in Dorset last week. Horrible little thing; it didn\u2019t look much, at all, but somehow just going near it gave you the shivers. I was the escort for Holloway and he couldn\u2019t handle it \u2013 he was scared, to be honest. They called Rivett in and he was all, <em>The sooner Malfoy gets back, the better</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said those exact words?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I was right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>I wave a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure Nott could deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, course. He did, but Rivett told him before he started, \u2018Watch yourself. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be with both you and Malfoy out of action.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>I take a swallow of wine, let it slide cool and steadying down my throat. I have the stupidest feeling my cheeks are getting warm. \u201cWell,\u201d I say, keeping my voice neutral. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be missed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks as though he\u2019s making up his mind about something, then rummages in his robes. \u201cI, er, actually brought something to show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done something a little... well, you might not approve.\u201d He grins, then, and there\u2019s a worrying hint of wickedness to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done <em>what</em>?\u201d God help us.</p>\n<p>He fumbles with the robes again, then slides something out of the pocket. It\u2019s wrapped in soft black fabric, and as he unrolls it, I see a flash of silver.</p>\n<p><em>No.</em> It can\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>He lifts the fabric, letting the contents slither onto his knee. The collar. It\u2019s the bloody collar, large as life and twice as tempting.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter. What in the name of Salazar\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises his eyes to mine and pulls a rueful face. \u201cWell, if they will leave these things just lying around...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>stole</em> it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014 Well. If you put it that way... yes. I did. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s missed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I have no words. I gape at him, at the length of bright silver sitting innocently on his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got quite attached to it, you know?\u201d He holds it up, and it snakes around his wrist as if seeking the warmth of his skin. He flicks his eyes up to me again. \u201cI know what you said.\u201d I can see the tension around his jaw. \u201cAbout Lafarge. But I thought it might be different, you know?\u201d He scans my face. \u201cIf I put it on knowing what it does. Because I wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can hear the blood pounding in my ears. The reckless, idiotic... And he\u2019s just sitting there, waiting for me to speak. Has he the slightest idea what his suggestion does to me? \u201cKnowing what it does,\u201d I echo. My voice sounds odd and expressionless.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d He watches my reaction carefully. \u201cIt would be entirely my choice.\u201d He turns the length of metal over in his hands, and it coils around his arm again. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say that would be different?\u201d</p>\n<p>A hundred images flash into my brain of him collared, willing, <em>biddable</em>. Submissive by his own choice. I close my eyes for a moment against the intoxicating flood of heat that rolls through me. When I speak again, I pitch my voice deeper. \u201cOh, yes. That would be quite different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had Nott check it over,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no curse on it. There never was.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t keep the disbelief out of my voice. \u201c<em>Theo</em> checked it for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cYeah. I took a chance on telling him. I like him, actually. He\u2019s not overly bothered about playing by the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Potter. Does he know...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I took it for? I think he can probably guess.\u201d Potter doesn\u2019t even try to hide his grin.</p>\n<p>I feel like letting my face sink into my hands. Having failed to get us both killed, Potter\u2019s new ambition is to have us both sacked. I fix him with a glare, but his hands are lifting the collar towards his throat, the fluid metal shifting and twisting as if eager to be close to him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I?\u201d His voice is low, his face expectant. \u201cI mean... I don\u2019t have to. I want you without this, Malfoy -- fuck, I feel like I\u2019ve wanted you forever. But I know how good this could make us both feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, indicating the sofa beside me. He sits down close enough that I can feel the heat from his leg next to mine. His pupils are wide and black as I reach out to touch the skin of his throat, and he shivers as my fingers slide down it, tracing the line of his neck down to the collarbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d I ask him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell, yes. I want it for both of us. I\u2019ll be honest\u2026 I get a kick out of the thought of you telling me what to do anyway.\u201d His face flushes, but he doesn\u2019t break eye contact. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit weird, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rich, raw joy throbbing through me. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unusual, perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you like it.\u201d He searches for something in my face and apparently finds it. \u201cYou do like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>I incline my head. \u201cYes. I do like it.\u201d The words are inadequate but they seem to satisfy him, his eyes closing as my fingers brush against his Adam\u2019s apple, briefly letting my hand rest around his throat where the collar would lie. I can feel his pulse beating beneath the skin, strong and rousing. \u201cThe collar... you can take it off again when you want to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny time I like. It\u2019s a simple incantation.\u201d</p>\n<p>I feel on fire with want and anticipation. \u201cDo it,\u201d I say, and the heady rush of giving him an order throbs through me.</p>\n<p>He barely has to bring it to his skin before it coils itself around his throat. He lets out a groan as it settles into place, the end clasps melting into one another until only a smooth, unbroken circle remains. It looks as if it were made for him.</p>\n<p>His eyes close for a moment, and when they open, they\u2019re fixed on me. His lips are parted, expectant, and god, I can\u2019t resist him, not for another second.</p>\n<p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I say, and the collar shifts, pulsing and transmuting, for a scant moment before he leans towards me and his whole body seems to rack with the force of it. I hold him steady as it roars through him, tasting his mouth and the piquancy of the wine on his lips. I can feel him give in to it, leaning against me as his body floods with delight, and I rest my fingers against the collar and kiss him until I feel the last trembling pulse of it die away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Malfoy, god, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>I draw back to look at him. His face blazes with need, the collar snug around his throat, shining against his skin. I want to touch him; I want to <em>own</em> him. I stroke the line of his jaw, see his eyes flutter closed and for a moment there\u2019s no filter between my thoughts and my tongue. \u201cYou look so fucking beautiful like this,\u201d I tell him, and he moans again, his body shivering beneath my touch. I pull my hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe collar... That wasn\u2019t an order, but it still\u2014\u201d I feel the cold drip of panic in my chest. \u201cSomething\u2019s gone wrong with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cShit, Draco. That wasn\u2019t the collar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fool, that\u2019s how you make me feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stretch out my hand again, let my fingers brush over the cool surface of the collar and then trace along his throat beneath. He closes his eyes, a small gasp spilling from his lips. I want to stop thinking, questioning. I want to lose myself, the way he does. But\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if the collar has trained you to be receptive to me?\u201d I don\u2019t stop touching him, though, even as I try to remember where I\u2019ve heard of the idea. \u201cLike that Muggle, you know. With the bells, and the dogs\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s brows draw down. \u201cI may be wearing a collar, but I\u2019m not a fucking dog, Malfoy.\u201d He looks ready to pull his wand on me. \u201cI\u2019ve told you how I feel. Now shut up.\u201d His eyes move across my face, seeking out my lips again. \u201cShut up and tell me what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKneel.\u201d The word bursts from my lips in a hot rush. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or wrong. I just know I can\u2019t hide from this any longer.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t hesitate, just drops to the floor, a heartfelt groan spilling from his lips as he goes. I have to have him. Nothing on earth could stop me now.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your tunic off.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wearing the type with buttons down one side today. His eyes burn into me as he moves his hands to the top button, and as his fingers slip it free, I see a long shudder pass through him. \u201c<em>Uhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d I tell him, before it\u2019s even over, and his fingers falter over the next one. His mouth falls open, the sounds he makes beyond anything I could have dreamed. His tunic parts to reveal the line of his collarbones, and, lower, that delicious trail of black hair. I want to take his tunic and yank the last buttons free, ripping it from his body, but instead, I give him a minute to work at them, watching the fascinating planes of his muscles shifting as he moves.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d I tell him, and he\u2019s slipping it from his shoulders and moaning in bliss as it falls to the floor. My eyes run all over him, drinking him in. Harry Potter, shirtless on my silk rug and Merlin, he looks so fine that it hurts. A throbbing ache settles just under my ribs. He looks so <em>powerful</em>, his body lean and strong, a new scar on his ribs making my fingers twitch with the urge to trace it. His fists clench at his thighs, and beneath the scarlet wool of his trousers I can see the thick line of his cock pressing against his fly. He\u2019s on his fucking knees for me, and it\u2019s because he wants to be there. Because he wants to give himself to me and to the satisfaction of the collar. And it\u2019s so good that I feel like something inside of me might tear apart with how perfect it is.</p>\n<p>I stand up, and he looks up at me, head tilted in expectation. He looks fearless. As if nothing bad could ever happen to him. I run my hand over his jaw and he turns to press his lips to my palm. His eyes flick up to mine, his lips parting damp against my skin and Salazar, how can he hold such power when he\u2019s down on his knees? I feel as shaky and off-balance as I did when I first came home from St Mungo\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, Draco,\u201d he whispers. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>I gesture with my hand. \u201cStand up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets to his feet, the wave hitting halfway through. I hold his elbow to steady him and he leans against me and pants it out. His chest is flushed, his neck mottled with pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you in my bed,\u201d I say, nothing in the world more important than those six short words. I hear his breath hitch and I don\u2019t give him any further warning, just picture my room in my mind and make a sharp twist to the right, my arm round his waist. We land in the middle of my four poster, Potter losing balance and tumbling on top of me, his stubble scratchy against my cheek.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re both breathing hard again. Potter pushes up on his arms and gazes at my mouth hungrily before leaning in. I lie back and let him kiss me, relishing the hard press of his body against mine and the softness of the bed beneath us. Potter\u2019s mouth moves hot and damp over my skin, his hands greedy on my body. His lips are on my throat, his hands squeezing at my arse when I wind my hands into the thick softness of his hair and tug, just enough to get his attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d I say, and he does. I feel every inch of the shudder that rocks through him, his moan loud and almost tortured.</p>\n<p>He looks at me from under heavy lids as it dies away. \u201cHell, Malfoy. <em>Ohhh</em>.\u201d He takes a few shaky breaths and then his hands are under my shirt, fingers moving over my ribs, the sensitive skin of my waist. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClothes off,\u201d I tell him, and he rolls over and reaches for his boots.</p>\n<p>\u201cStand up first,\u201d I say, and he scrambles to his feet and then clutches at the bedpost, bent double with his eyes closed, crooning and cursing. I watch, drinking in every detail. When it\u2019s passed, his fingers work quickly at buckles, belt, and buttons, and then he\u2019s pushing his trousers to his ankles, the jut of his cock mouth-watering against the cotton of his underwear. He\u2019s making so many sounds that I can\u2019t tell where one bout ends and the next begins. \u201cStrip,\u201d I tell him, and he tucks his thumbs into the elastic of his pants and gets them to mid-thigh before his fingers shake so hard that he has to stop. His cock is flushed and thick and it twitches in mid-air, once, twice, three times, Potter gripping the bedpost again, his muscles strained taut. He looks exactly as if he\u2019s about to come, his balls drawn up high, his face contorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I whisper, and he gulps in a breath and pushes his underwear the rest of the way down and steps out of them. He\u2019s naked except for the collar, a scrawl of black hair across his chest and lying in thick curls around his cock. There are scars here and there, a deep one running across one thigh, the skin drawn uneven in the characteristic pucker of a curse-scar. His body is so strong. So flawed, so <em>real</em>. He pulls off his glasses, places them on the bedside table. He looks vulnerable, suddenly, standing there with his brows pulled down, as if he\u2019s unsure whether I\u2019ll like what\u2019s on offer.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve never seen anything I\u2019ve wanted more, and what rips through me with the most dazzling sweetness is that I can have him \u2013 sweet Merlin, I can have him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, and he crawls onto the bed, his shoulders curling inward with pleasure, soft huffs falling from his lips as he comes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me undress,\u201d I tell him, and our fingers move together over the fastenings of my robes, his quivering uselessly at first as another wave hits him. He pants into my hair, soft noises and parts of words spilling from his lips. \u201cDraco\u2026 <em>Oh</em>.\u201d His fingers linger over every inch of my skin as it is revealed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to do anything.\u201d He bends to my shoulder, his mouth soft, and hot, with just a hint of teeth in the kisses he trails towards my throat. \u201cNot for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>My brows draw together. \u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! God, no.\u201d He screws up his face. \u201cI just\u2014 I can\u2019t concentrate on you while the collar\u2019s... you know. And I want to make it good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I want to laugh at the idea of this being anything but good. But I don\u2019t protest. Instead I let him finish taking off my shirt, trailing his mouth over my skin as he undoes each button. I prop myself up on one arm to watch as he takes off my trousers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see, I can go slow if I want to,\" he tells me, and I have to stifle the sounds that bubble up as he presses one open-mouthed kiss after another along my stomach, his strong hands resting on my thighs. He dips his head to nuzzle my prick through my underwear and Merlin, he looks like something from a potions-dream \u2013 the sort they sell on the top shelf \u2013 his lips reddened and plump, and hungry sounds building in his throat.</p>\n<p>I have to remind myself that this is far too good to rush. I let him slide my pants slowly down, his nose, his lips, moving against my thigh, and I resist the urge to thrust against him. Oh, hell, his breath on my skin, hot, damp, and teasing. I\u2019m so fucking hard, my cock straining up towards the ceiling.</p>\n<p>His hands reach up to stroke across my ribs and down, settling at my hips and resting there. His tongue licks a wide swipe from the base of my cock to the tip and I moan, a strangled sound of need, as startling sweetness rips through me. When he looks up at me, his pupils are wide enough to drown in, and his voice is a low rasp. \u201cUhh\u2026 Waited so long for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as if it isn\u2019t written all over his face, but I ask him anyway. \u201cYou want me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than ever,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to fuck you?\u201d I ask him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it,\u201d I tell him, a little steel in my voice.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uhh</em>. Fuck me.\u201d The words become ragged as the collar takes hold. He forces the words out even as his body curls in on itself with the force of it. \u201cOh, god, I need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Desire pulses through my veins, hot and intense. I summon a small glass bottle of lube and pass it to him. \u201cPrepare yourself,\u201d I tell him.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought about this. What I could have done, if I had given him what he asked for that night. I\u2019ve imagined him like this, stripped, on my bed, his legs drawn up. Holding himself open for me to see. His hand slick with oil, fingers pushing inside, readying himself for me. I\u2019ve imagined his moans and sighs, the way his body would buck at my command. And it\u2019s the thought of that becoming a reality which makes my hands shake as I hold out the bottle.</p>\n<p>He takes it from me, but hesitates. The collar is pulsing and I can see him swallowing, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing above it. Is he <em>shy</em>? The thought of him being self-conscious just spurs me on.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrepare yourself,\u201d I tell him, giving my voice an edge.</p>\n<p>He looks up at me, his hair falling in his eyes. \u201cI, er.\u201d His grin is more hesitant than normal. \u201cI already did it.\u201d He hands back the bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did it earlier. After you owled. I... well. I thought we might not want to wait around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was in the loos at work.\u201d His grin is broadening now. \u201cRon came in to piss while I was doing it. He was chatting to Carstairs at the sinks and I was in a cubicle...\u201d</p>\n<p>I close my eyes briefly. Potter, in the Ministry toilets. Working himself open, thinking of me. I have to take a deep, steadying breath.</p>\n<p>He runs a hand over my back, his palm warm and firm against my spine as he lies back against my sheets and pulls me down next to him. His cock slides across my thigh, leaving a trail of sticky heat. \u201cI thought we might just do it on the floor or something. As soon as I got here. Or, you know. Up against the wall.\u201d His eyes crinkle with amusement.</p>\n<p>My body reacts instantly to the suggestion, my cock jerking with eager interest, and I wonder if he notices. My words are more controlled. \u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just not very good at waiting sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait next time, though. Don\u2019t do it until I say.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Next time</em>. Who says there\u2019ll be a next time? But he doesn\u2019t seem to think it strange.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won't.\u201d</p>\n<p>My hands move over his body, his thighs parting for me at the merest pressure. He\u2019s all heat and drive and tension, with a tingling energy that seems to spark under my fingertips. \u201cI want to watch you. Next time,\u201d I tell him, and then my fingers seek out the puckered skin of his arsehole and find it wet and ready for me, and I nearly lose my head.</p>\n<p>I slide my finger inside and he makes a small, fierce sound of encouragement. I don\u2019t wait, adding another finger, pushing past the ridged rings of muscle. He\u2019s lubed, but \u2013 <em>Merlin</em> \u2013 he\u2019s certainly not loose. I push inside again and twist, feeling the resistance, the friction and heat, while Potter shudders as much as he ever did for the collar.</p>\n<p>He mouths at my neck, his hands gripping my biceps. \u201cFuck, I want you inside me.\u201d He growls it out against my skin like a threat. \u201cDamn you, Malfoy, I <em>need</em> you inside of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hell, the feel of him around my fingers, slippery and tight. His words are like liquid fuel tossed onto a flame. I fumble with the bottle and slick myself up, quick and impatient, and it <em>still</em> takes too long.</p>\n<p>Potter watches me with ravenous eyes. \u201cYes, now. Come on, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d I say, sharply. I can\u2019t bear the ache of wanting him so much. The collar pulses and he bucks on the bed and moans. <em>Oh, god</em>. I go to part his legs again while he\u2019s still writhing and he draws his knees up and holds them apart for me. <em>Sweet Salazar</em>. I think I might hurt him with how quickly I have to be inside him. It feels like life and death.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco. Draco,\u201d he pants, and I feel a fierce flash of hunger for him. \u201cWider,\u201d I tell him, and he stretches himself open, letting out a deep groan that sounds right on the border between pain and pleasure.</p>\n<p>The sight of him holding himself ready for me, his powerful body quivering for it, stirs a kind of madness in me. I thrust into him, savage and deep and determined. His body struggles against the fullness before yielding to me, and I\u2019m glad. It makes it all the sweeter when I\u2019m finally seated inside him and he\u2019s under me, wild-eyed and breathless and fiery.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s better than I ever dreamed. So much better.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck... you\u2019re still so tight,\u201d I grit out.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Wanted it like that. Wanted to feel you,\u201d he pants. His legs wrap around me, as if urging me on, and I drive into him with hard, relentless strokes until he can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t do anything except lie there and take it. His eyes are shut, his mouth hangs open, and he\u2019s gasping with the intensity of it. I feel far too close to the edge. Far far too close to losing myself in him. I have to summon every shred of self-control to stop myself just ramming into the sweet tightness of his body until I\u2019m spent.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I tell him, and he takes a great shuddering breath and opens his eyes, and somehow keeps them open all through the wave of sensation from the collar. His body clenches around me, achingly erotic, and again I teeter on the edge, but more than that, the intimacy of the whole act jolts through me, strange and shocking. The way it feels to have Potter under me, so willing and so full of need.</p>\n<p>As the peak passes he pulls me in, hand clasped on the back of my neck, for a kiss, his mouth open and greedy, sloppy and rough and tender all together. He tastes of salt and heat and something dark and smoky, something I could lose my head over. I move inside him, wanting to bottle the moment that he arches up to meet me and I sink even deeper.</p>\n<p>I move again and he\u2019s lost in it, head tipped back and hands tightening around my hips to pull me closer. He holds nothing back, and it almost frightens me, the rawness of it. I nuzzle his neck as I fuck into him, breathing the bright tang of his cologne and the scent of his skin, warm and intoxicating. Hot coils of delight flood through me \u2013 my thighs, my stomach, my balls, the very core of me, all thrilling with sharp bursts of pleasure as my prick drives deep into him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s making little desperate growls in his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t stop. God, fuck me hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>And finally, it\u2019s like a dam bursting. All of my reservations. My scruples. My self-control and my doubts. All swept away in the face of Potter\u2019s desire. I give him everything I\u2019ve got, and I feel as if I might break with the bliss of it. The bed is rocking against the wall. I hear myself grunting, low and brutish, and I can\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>. Draco. You beautiful bastard.\u201d He looks wrecked, his hair damp with sweat, face flushed and wild. I thrust in, almost cruelly, one more time, and then hold every muscle in my body rigid as I struggle against the ferocious tide of orgasm waiting to flood through me.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s panting beneath me. He grinds our bodies together, his mouth falling open at the friction. \u201cSo close...\u201d he moans. \u201cSo fucking close.\u201d</p>\n<p>I look down between our bodies, at the slick pool of sweat and pre-come gathering on his stomach. At his cock, cruelly hard and flushed such a deep pink. I pull out a little and watch it jerk, his stomach clenching, his arse gripping me sinfully tight.</p>\n<p>He makes a tortured sound. The tendons in his neck are standing out above the collar. I\u2019d almost forgotten he was wearing it. Almost, but not quite.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me how it feels,\u201d I whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uhhh</em>. Can\u2019t.\u201d The collar flickers and he twists his neck from side to side.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Tell me</em>, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uh.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>I should feel bad for insisting. He\u2019s almost beyond speech.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels so good.\u201d As soon as he\u2019s spoken, another surge passes through him and he\u2019s gasping, high and out of control.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me. More.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell. Feels like... fucking heaven, Malfoy.\u201d The next rush hits him, and he pants and moans while his arse twitches around me. \u201cYou inside me, I could die happy, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. More.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. I knew you\u2019d be like this.\u201d He shudders beneath me, his hands clutching at the sheets. I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. His eyes squeeze shut, his face twisted, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the collar or simply the roll of my hips that makes him gasp as I seek out every last hidden, secret inch of his body. \u201cAhh. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking \u2013 <em>uhhh</em> \u2013 proper all the time. I knew you\u2019d be filthy once you got going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every muscle in my body is poised ready to dive over the brink, every nerve clamouring to empty myself inside him. \u201cCome,\u201d I say, and his eyes widen for a moment as the collar flickers with muted colours. \u201cCome, Harry. Come <em>now</em>,\u201d I tell him, low and insistent, and then his prick twitches again and he groans so low, so profound, like it\u2019s being dragged out of him. His breath is erratic, juddering, and then his body is arching so hard that he nearly unseats me. The first long spurt of come hits his chest and I drive in, deeper and deeper, a raging, roiling heat rising and simmering over as he comes apart underneath me. I cry out, his cock jerking between us, the collar pulsing furiously, and then I don\u2019t know anything except pleasure, pure, unstoppable pleasure, bursting white hot and dazzling inside me.</p>\n<p>~***~</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s afterwards.</p>\n<p>After sex, Potter apparently likes to behave like a large, rather hairy blanket. His limbs are loose and heavy and wrapped around me, keeping me ridiculously warm. His eyelids are heavy, too, sleepy and sated as he lets his gaze wander over my face. I find I don\u2019t actually mind it. In fact, I could even sleep like this, and sleep well, I\u2019d wager, with Potter draped around me instead of the bed linen. I have no idea what time it is, but it looks like dusk is falling outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I stay?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I answer. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Perhaps we can have some dinner. Split a bottle of wine by the fire. And then...</p>\n<p>\u201cMight drift off for a bit, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Potter mumbles. \u201cI was on stake-out three nights this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d The thought of him curled up in my bed has an appeal of its own. My eyes fall to the collar, and I run my fingers over it appraisingly. \u201cAre you keeping this on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. I could do. I kind of got used to it, you know? But it\u2019s probably better to take it off for sleeping, I guess.\u201d He opens one eye to squint at me. \u201cAlthough it might be entertaining when you tell me to stop snoring or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou snore?\u201d I ask, in unimpressed tones.</p>\n<p>His hand trails across my hip. \u201cAnd what if I do? Going to make something of it, Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. You can sleep in the other room if you do.\u201d I wind my hand through the hair at the nape of his neck, pull him close to me so that our mouths almost touch and I can taste the smoky heat of his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d He smiles against my mouth. \u201cTry and make me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps you had better keep the collar <em>on</em>,\u201d I tell him, tightening my grip just a little bit. Just enough for him to feel the tug on his scalp.</p>\n<p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps I better had.\u201d</p>\n<p>I can feel his cock stirring against my leg. \u201cNot so sleepy now?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Maybe not. I knew this was one of my more brilliant ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich?\u201d I prop myself up on one arm and stare at him sternly. \u201cDo you mean messing about with potentially Dark objects? Stealing Ministry property? Or blatantly seducing a work colleague?\u201d</p>\n<p>I feel his laugh resonate against my shoulder. \u201cOh, all three, I\u2019d say, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least one of those is illegal and the other two are extremely inadvisable.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs some more, then pulls away looking sober. \u201cMalfoy\u2026 Er. I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>I wait as he runs a hand through his hair, rumpling it into even more of a mess while he considers what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, is this going to happen again, do you think?\u201d he continues. \u201cBecause it would probably be smart to tell Robards\u2026 if we don\u2019t want to both get the sack, that is. And I doubt I\u2019d be allowed to be your escort any more.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has a point. No more Potter cracking bad jokes while I\u2019m disarming a particularly vicious Spine-Crushing curse? No more Potter parking his distracting arse wherever I\u2019m trying to work? That alone would be incentive to continue. But there are other, more pressing reasons.</p>\n<p>My hand fits itself to the small of his back, pulling him in so that he can feel my prick hardening against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to happen again. In fact, I think it\u2019s going to happen again <em>right now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes him laugh again, and I realise how addictive a sound it is. Low, and rich, and warm. I kiss him hard, the taste of his mouth making need flame through me. How shall I have him this time? On his knees? On his stomach?
