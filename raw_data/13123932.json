  "text": "<p><em>park jimin:</em> eleven<br>\n<em>jeon jungkook:</em> nine</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>park jimin stared at his classmate, his\u00a0<em>mean</em>\u00a0classmate, sejun, in disbelief, \u201cy-you want me to arm wrestle with someone?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun grinned, \u201conly once you prove your strength can we allow you to play with us,\u00a0<em>jimin.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>jimin knew he wasn\u2019t the strongest eleven-year-old. he knew he was shorter than most of his classmates. he knew he could never run fast enough to escape them when they played\u00a0<em>police-police</em>. he knew, but still didn\u2019t understand why sejun and his group of friends wouldn\u2019t let jimin play with them. during recess, while sejun and his friends, which included most of the boys of their grade, played hide and seek and other exciting games (which jimin would <em>love</em> to be a part of), jimin would simply sit under the shade of a tree in the playground and colour in his\u00a0<em>marvel</em>\u00a0colouring book. he had, numerous times, asked to be included, only to have them whine at him, \u201c<em>but jimin</em>, you\u2019re so\u00a0<em>slow</em>. it\u2019s no fun to have you play with us. you\u2019re always caught out first. and when you become the denner, you\u2019re\u00a0<em>never</em>\u00a0able to find anybody!\u201d after having heard that same answer a few times, jimin stopped asking to be included.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but today, jimin asked again. he loved filling red and blue into spider-man\u2019s suit, but on some days, he\u2019d also love to play with his classmates. sometimes, just\u00a0<em>sometimes</em>, his heart would ache when he would hear the sounds of all the boys wholeheartedly laughing as they would run around, while he simply filled in the empty spaces with his crayons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>so jimin asked sejun, the strongest and most assertive boy of their grade who everyone from their grade considered as their <em>leader</em>, if he could play with them. but that only led to having sejun ask jimin to arm wrestle with someone in order to prove his strength, to prove that he was\u00a0<em>worthy</em>\u00a0enough to play with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s heart sped up anxiously at this idea, since he knew he\u2019d probably lose and end up getting mocked by most of his class for being defeated too easily. jimin tugged on his sweater sleeves and nervously looked around the playground, avoiding having to look at sejun. he\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0regretted asking to be included.\u00a0</p>\n<p>another boy, who jimin could never remember the name of, whispered something in sejun\u2019s ear, only to have sejun sigh and agree with the boy. jimin looked up at them, confused and curious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun spoke again, his harsh and loud voice making jimin flinch, \u201cwe know you\u2019re too scared to arm wrestle with someone from our grade. we know you think you\u2019ll lose\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201che doesn\u2019t think wrong,\u201d the boy next to sejun snickered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun let out a light laugh and continued, \u201chow about you arm wrestle with somebody from...<em>two</em> grades below us. you\u2019ll have higher chances of winning. actually, you probably will win. and then you can play with us.\u00a0<em>simple</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>something about sejun\u2019s devious grin told jimin that the offer wasn\u2019t made with the good intention that it seemed to have; it wasn\u2019t as\u00a0<em>simple</em>\u00a0as he made it sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but jimin was willing to take the chance.\u00a0<em>you\u2019re probably stronger than a nine-year-old,</em>\u00a0he told himself.\u00a0<em>but if you lose, it\u2019ll be ten time more humiliating</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>finally, jimin decided that it couldn\u2019t be more humiliating than having to sit under a tree every single day with a colouring book and a bunch of crayons while all the other boys played games together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201co-okay, i\u2019ll do it,\u201d jimin spoke softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun and his friend grinned at this. sejun patted jimin on the back, with a little too much force, making jimin stumble forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe\u2019ll arrange for a younger boy to arm wrestle against you by tomorrow, okay? during recess tomorrow, we\u2019ll just stay in an empty classroom and have the match there,\u201d sejun said, after which he walked away with his friend. jimin nodded, even though they were gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin knew he shouldn\u2019t have a good feeling about this, but something,\u00a0<em>something</em>\u00a0inside of him, told his heart to calm down, that everything would work out in the way that it\u2019s meant to. jimin placed his small hand on his chest, feeling the thumping of his heart. he whispered to himself, \u201cit\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll all be okay. very soon i\u2019ll be playing with my classmates in recess. i won\u2019t have to sit alone. <em>it\u2019s okay</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2661</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>it wasn\u2019t okay. nothing about this was okay,\u00a0</em>jimin<em>\u00a0</em>thought to himself as he saw his opponent walk into the classroom with sejun and a few other boys from jimin\u2019s grade.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin didn\u2019t know the opponent\u2019s name, but he had seen this boy play basketball once. jimin had seen him play basketball against jimin\u2019s own classmate, only to have jimin\u2019s classmate grumble on for the next two weeks that he lost to a younger boy because the boy cheated. jimin had seen the match. the younger boy, who was much taller than jimin, had\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0cheated. it was an honest win. he hadn\u2019t played with any aggression, nor any foul techniques, but he had played with skill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin saw the boy step foot into the empty classroom where sejun had told jimin to wait. jimin should have known that sejun wouldn\u2019t give jimin a fair chance, that he\u2019d put jimin against somebody who was younger but probably <em>stronger</em> than most of their grade. <em>jimin\u2019s heart sank.</em></p>\n<p>sejun, along with jimin\u2019s opponent and a few other boys from jimin\u2019s grade, walked towards where jimin was seated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun smirked and he put his arm around jimin\u2019s opponent\u2019s shoulder as they both towered over jimin who was still seated on a chair (jimin felt so\u00a0<em>small).</em><br>\n<br>\nsejun\u2019s loud voice boomed through the classroom, \u201chey chubby chubs, this is\u00a0<em>jungkook</em>, the boy you\u2019ll be arm wrestling against. he\u2019s two years younger to us, giving you an advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>there was\u00a0<em>no</em>\u00a0advantage, but jimin didn\u2019t have the courage to open his mouth and protest.</p>\n<p>jungkook<em>,\u00a0</em>that\u2019s what jimin learnt was his name, took a seat in front of jimin, only the common table between them separating them. jimin took in a sharp breath, even jungkook\u2019s presence was intimidating enough for jimin. jimin\u2019s eyes wandered to jungkook\u2019s face. his hair was jet black, his eyes were determined to win, and his thin pink lips looked as soft as velvet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt himself flush in embarrassment at the realisation of the fact that he was staring at jungkook\u2019s lips. <em>but</em> <em>he\u2019s so pretty</em>, jimin thought, and cursed himself for having such thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chi, i\u2019m jeon jungkook,\u201d the younger boy grinned and extended his hand, his eyes having softened towards jimin a bit. jungkook\u2019s smile reminded jimin of a bunny\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>\u201ch-hi, i\u2019m park jimin,\u201d jimin said, slipping his hand into jungkook\u2019s hand in order to shake it.\u00a0<em>his hand is so large</em>, jimin thought to himself, <em>and warm</em>.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2661</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>his hand is so soft, so small...</em>thought jungkook, as jimin slowly grabbed onto his hand. jungkook gave jimin\u2019s hand a soft shake, and offered jimin another smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had walked into the classroom all riled up, full of energy. he wanted to\u00a0<em>win</em>.</p>\n<p>sejun, his senior, had approached him in recess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chey jungkook,\u201d sejun had called out to jungkook while jungkook was busy gobbling down his food while sitting with his friends. jungkook had been confused to see sejun standing there. sejun was from two grades above jungkook, and jungkook wasn\u2019t friends with sejun. in fact, he wasn\u2019t friends with any of his seniors, despite having defeated them in various sports matches. maybe that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t friends with any of them; most of them felt threatened by the fact that jungkook was better than them, despite being younger to them. he had never played against sejun, though. sejun seemed like he was too\u00a0<em>cool</em>\u00a0to want to play with someone younger. jungkook had often spotted sejun teasing jungkook\u2019s classmates.\u00a0and jungkook didn\u2019t like it, not one bit, but they weren\u2019t jungkook\u2019s friends who sejun had been teasing, and the teasing never seemed too harsh, so it wasn\u2019t enough to make jungkook resent sejun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had gotten up and walked towards sejun, who seemed eager to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cgood morning, sejun hyung,\u201d jungkook had said, smiling at his senior.</p>\n<p>\u201cjungkook,\u201d sejun had said, a smirk playing on his lips, \u201cwe have a challenge for you. we know you\u2019re the best in your grade at almost everything. but do you think you\u2019d be able to beat someone from\u00a0<em>our</em>\u00a0grade at a game of arm wrestling?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was good at almost every sport,\u00a0<em>he knew that,</em>\u00a0but arm wrestling...he was\u00a0<em>extra</em>\u00a0good at that. competitiveness suddenly took over every inch of his body, causing him to confidently grin at sejun, \u201cbring it on, sejun hyung.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>and now he sat here, facing a small boy with fluffy blonde hair, chubby pink cheeks, and plump lips which looked soft enough to\u00a0<em>bite</em>. jungkook felt his heart hammer in his chest. he told himself it was because he was nervous for the match.\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0because he thought the boy in front of him was cute enough for him to want to gobble up.\u00a0<em>no, definitely not.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>jungkook noticed just how\u00a0<em>scared</em>\u00a0the boy looked<em>.\u00a0</em>his cheeks were flushed, and jungkook wondered why.\u00a0<em>it\u2019s probably because of the cold,</em>\u00a0jungkook thought to himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook realised he didn\u2019t want the boy to feel scared. jungkook knew he came across as intimidating, possibly because he owned a frame which was larger than most nine-year olds, or possibly because he was so aggressively\u00a0<em>good</em>\u00a0at sports. jungkook didn\u2019t mind his fellow classmates and seniors looking at him as a threat, but the idea of the little boy in front of him (who he couldn\u2019t believe was\u00a0<em>older</em>\u00a0than him) feeling scared of him, really upset him. this is what made jungkook muster up a grin and shake hands with the boy, whose name sejun had mentioned to be...<em>jimin</em>? he wasn\u2019t sure if he remembered correctly. jungkook had assumed sejun would be making jungkook fight with somebody who was strong, who would be a\u00a0<em>challenge</em>. jungkook was genuinely confused as to why there was such a small boy in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was correct about his name, he realised, as jimin went ahead and introduced himself after jungkook told jimin his own name. jimin\u2019s voice was slightly shaky. jungkook heard a few boys snicker around him. why were all these classmates of jimin so excited to watch this? maybe jimin was one of those people who looked small and weak, but were secretly very strong.</p>\n<p>jungkook cracked his neck on both sides, ready to try his best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun patted jungkook\u2019s back and spoke, \u201cshall we begin?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook nodded eagerly, and jimin offered an unsure nod. jungkook couldn\u2019t get his eyes to leave jimin\u2019s face. but he finally managed to peel his eyes off jimin as he told himself to concentrate on the task at hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook kept his elbow on the table firmly, and opened his hand for jimin to hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cjimin hyung, let\u2019s start. best of three?\u201d jungkook asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin took a visibly large gulp and nodded. jimin placed his smaller hand in jungkook\u2019s, jimin\u2019s heart thumping in his chest.\u00a0<em>i\u2019m going to lose against a boy younger to me and everyone is going to make fun of me and they\u2019ll never let me play with them again and-</em></p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s spiral of thoughts were disrupted by sejun\u2019s countdown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cten, nine, eight...,\u201d sejun spoke, loud and clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but jimin couldn\u2019t focus on the countdown. he was too scared. he was going to blow up his only chance of playing with his classmates.</p>\n<p>jimin flinched when he felt jungkook\u2019s thumb softly caressed his hand. it was almost as if he were trying to...<em>comfort</em>\u00a0jimin? jimin\u2019s eyes went wide as he stared at the larger boy, who\u2019s eyes were determinately fixated on their hands. jimin assumed the caressing was a mistake, and went back to focus on their interlocked hands. the countdown finished, and the battle started.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook used all his strength to push jimin\u2019s hand, and in a matter of a few seconds, he felt his arm overpower jimin\u2019s completely. jungkook had won this round, pinning jimin\u2019s hand to the table. the sound of jimin\u2019s hand hitting the table was <em>loud</em>, and jimin let out a little mewl in pain.\u00a0<em>he even sounds like a kitten</em>, thought jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>behind jungkook, sejun and jimin\u2019s classmates cheered for jungkook\u2019s victory, but all jungkook could do was look at jimin sit there with his plump pink lips in a pout while he used his left hand to rub over his right hand\u2019s knuckles which had harshly hit against table when jungkook had pinned his hand down.</p>\n<p>jungkook had the immediate urge to take jimin\u2019s right had in his and massage his chubby hand, which had felt so soft and squishy in jungkook\u2019s hand just a few moments ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked so dejected, and his classmates were roaring in excitement.\u00a0<em>if they were his classmates, why weren\u2019t they cheering for him? why did they cheer for jungkook?\u00a0</em>jungkook sat there in confusion, staring at everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>sejun broke jungkook\u2019s train of thought by beginning to count down for the second round of arm wrestling. jungkook placed his elbow on the table and opened his hand for jimin\u2019s hand. he looked at jimin expectantly. jimin was still busy staring down at his own small little hands while rubbing them together. jungkook really must have hurt jimin\u2019s right hand when he won. jungkook felt his heart clench.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin suddenly looked up at jungkook, and placed his hand in jungkook\u2019s, ready for the next round. jimin looked determined. his nostrils were flared and his puffed out an annoyed breath.\u00a0<em>cute</em>, jungkook thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>at the sound of \u201cgo\u201d, jimin used all his might to push against jungkook\u2019s hand.\u00a0<em>he\u2019s too strong for me</em>, jimin thought, a mix of annoyance and sadness taking over him. if jungkook won this round then it was over for jimin. jimin wanted to\u00a0win <em>so</em> badly. he just wanted\u00a0<em>play</em>\u00a0with the students of his grade. jimin just wanted some\u2026<em>friends</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>no matter how hard jimin tried, he couldn\u2019t push against jungkook\u2019s arm. he couldn\u2019t make jungkook\u2019s arm tilt in the opposite direction. jungkook\u2019s hand felt sturdy and strong in the middle of his chubby hand. jimin noticed that jungkook hadn\u2019t started applying much pressure yet.\u00a0<em>why wasn\u2019t jungkook trying?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>jimin looked up at jungkook, only to find jungkook already staring at him. jimin felt his cheeks heat up under the steady gaze of the stronger boy, but he didn\u2019t look away. he stared into jungkook\u2019s deep brown eyes. jungkook\u2019s eyes were so pretty.\u00a0<em>jungkook </em><em>was so pretty.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>all of a sudden, jimin felt jungkook use his strength. jimin\u2019s hand was about to hit the table, indicating his loss, but jimin was surprised when his knuckles his something\u00a0<em>soft</em>\u00a0instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes fell to the table, and he saw jungkook\u2019s left hand placed under jimin\u2019s right one, protecting his knuckles from hitting the table like they had in the previous round. jimin had <em>lost</em>, but instead of feeling sad, an unsettling fuzzy feeling spread through his stomach at the feeling of jungkook\u2019s larger hand protecting his own hand from hitting the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt his face heat up, and his eyes darted towards jungkook\u2019s. jungkook\u2019s cheeks tinged pink and he immediately averted jimin\u2019s gaze while simultaneously pulling his hand away from below jimin\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked around, only to see his own classmates cheering for jungkook having won.\u00a0<em>did his classmates hate him this much?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>no one seemed to have noticed the quick act of jungkook placing his hand under jimin\u2019s while pinning jimin\u2019s hand down. jimin sighed in relief, but he felt his throat tighten at the feeling of shame at having lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201csorry chubs, you won\u2019t be playing with us!\u201d sejun laughed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin wanted to <em>cry</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook felt confused after hearing sejun\u2019s words. jungkook wondered what this match had to do with jimin playing with his classmates. he looked at jimin, who sat there silently, nose slightly red, eyes blinking furiously.\u00a0<em>was jimin trying to not cry?</em></p>\n<p>jungkook watched jimin push his chair back and get up hastily. jimin grabbed his bag and ran out of the class, covering his face with his left hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>aww</em>,\u201d a boy from jimin\u2019s class cooed, \u201clittle chubs has gone out to\u00a0<em>cry</em>\u00a0because he can\u2019t play with us anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201canymore?\u201d another classmate scoffed mockingly, \u201che could never play with us, he\u2019s so tiny, so <em>weak</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook felt his heart thump in his chest. he clenched both of his hands into fists. without even realising it, jungkook roared at the boys around him, \u201cyou\u2019re all so...so\u2026<em>mean</em>! you don\u2019t play with him because he\u2019s <em>small</em>? what\u2019s\u00a0<em>wrong</em>\u00a0with you all? i thought i was here for a challenge. not to\u00a0<em>ridicule</em>\u00a0somebody.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>everyone was stunned at jungkook\u2019s loud voice. some even looked...<em>scared</em>. jungkook saw them lower their heads. before sejun could speak up to argue with him, jungkook barged out of the class, in hope of finding jimin. but the hallway was empty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook frantically searched most of the school for jimin, but jimin was nowhere to be found.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2661</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>a few days passed by, but jungkook did not see jimin around school. though, that didn\u2019t stop him from thinking about jimin.\u00a0<em>he couldn\u2019t get jimin out of his head.</em>\u00a0jimin was so\u00a0<em>small</em>, so\u00a0<em>cute</em>, so\u00a0<em>innocent</em>. something about the boy made jungkook want to befriend him and protect him from all the evils of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was in the middle of a basketball game when he finally spotted jimin. jimin was sitting under the shade of a tree,\u00a0wearing a white sweater which was way too large for his small frame. his little sweater-paws made jungkook\u2019s heart summersault inside his chest. jungkook heard his teammates, all of whom was much older to jungkook, yell out to him for him to concentrate. jungkook waved them off and told them he\u2019d be back in a few minutes. jungkook proceeded to jog towards jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin fumbled with his crayons as he reached out to pick up a new colour. jimin stared at the drawing of the butterfly which he was currently colouring and thought of which area to colour next. he tried his best to drown out the sound of children playing from around him. he felt a shadow loom over himself and immediately looked up. he flinched slightly at the sight of a tall boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>oh, it was jungkook.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt his heart race at the sight of the pretty boy with jet black hair. he told himself it was because of the shame of losing to him, but deep down, he knew it wasn\u2019t\u00a0<em>just</em>\u00a0that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was smiling widely at jimin. jimin looked up at him, confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmay i sit with you?\u201d jungkook asked, still smiling. jimin giggled at jungkook\u2019s cute bunny rabbit teeth.</p>\n<p>jimin actually\u00a0<em>giggled</em>. jungkook was left wide eyed. how could someone\u2019s laugh possibly sound\u00a0<em>this</em>\u00a0melodious? how could someone be this\u00a0<em>adorable</em>?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cy-yes,\u201d jimin said, mentally hitting himself for having giggled. he must\u2019ve sounded so\u00a0<em>stupid</em>. jungkook must already think of him as a loser. after all, jungkook had seen jimin\u2019s own classmates ridicule him. he had seen jimin, at the brink of tears, run out of the classroom. jimin felt his whole face heat up, and this time, it was definitely in embarrassment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook plunked himself onto the grass, next to jimin. jimin had looked so embarrassed and uncomfortable after letting out that giggle. jungkook wondered\u00a0<em>why</em>. he didn\u2019t want jimin to feel worse, so to be safe, he left a decent amount of space between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>there was silence for an entire minute. jimin fumbled with his fingers.\u00a0jungkook watched<em>.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201ci...i think we met in the wrong manner, at the wrong time. let\u2019s introduce ourselves again? i\u2019m jeon jungkook,\u201d jungkook said, offering jimin a shy smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin wanted to giggle again at jungkook\u2019s smile. at jungkook\u2019s sweetness for sitting next to him.\u00a0<em>he probably just feels bad for me,\u00a0</em>jimin realised.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cy-you don\u2019t have to sit with me just because you feel bad for me. it\u2019s okay,\u201d jimin said. \u201cit\u2019s recess for you too right now, right? you were probably enjoying playing with your friends.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook frowned, \u201ci\u2019m sitting with you because i want to,\u00a0<em>park jimin.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>he remembered my full name,\u00a0</em>jimin realised, and gulped at jungkook\u2019s assertive tone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201co-oh,\u201d jimin whispered, suddenly intimidated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook noticed this and panicked, \u201cn-no it wasn\u2019t my intention to say it like that. i just want you to know that i... genuinely want to sit with you. i want to be your...<em>friend</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked at jungkook, confused and interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cw-why?\u201d jimin asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>because you\u2019re so cute. also, i\u2019m curious about what\u2019s going on in that mind of yours.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>but jungkook couldn\u2019t say\u00a0<em>that</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook gulped, not knowing what to say. until he noticed the almost fully coloured butterfly drawing in jimin\u2019s lap. he had filled the butterfly\u2019s wings with pastel shades of yellow and blue. jungkook smiled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci think you colour really well,\u201d jungkook said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin suppressed a smile, \u201ct-thank you.\u201d \u201calso, it\u2019s\u00a0<em>hyung</em>\u00a0to you,\u201d jimin added. he instantly regretted it, realising that he\u2019d never had the guts to say that to anybody before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook laughed, showing his bunny teeth again. he rephrased his words, \u201ci think you colour really well, jiminie\u00a0<em>hyung</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin grinned at the nickname, all fear fading away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cso...are we\u00a0<em>friends</em>\u00a0now? will...will you play with me during recess sometimes?\u201d jimin asked jungkook, suddenly shy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes we\u2019re friends, hyung,\u201d jungkook smiled. \u201cand i\u2019ll play with you during recess...<em>everyday</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt excitement and disbelief bubble inside of him. he suddenly grabbed jungkook\u2019s hand and pushed himself off the ground, pulling jungkook up with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook couldn\u2019t help but feel amused at the smaller boy\u2019s excitement. jungkook\u2018s eyes met jimin\u2019s sparkling ones. jimin was grinning from ear to ear and his eyes were in the shape of little crescents. jungkook, yet again, felt his heartbeat pick up speed at this adorable sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201clet\u2019s go play something right now then!\u201d jimin said, still holding on to jungkook\u2019s arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat would you like to play?\u201d jungkook softly asked, in complete awe of jimin\u2019s happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin began to eagerly list down all the games he had in mind.</p>\n<p>and thus, their friendship, their\u00a0<em>love</em>, began.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>park jimin:</em> fifteen<br>\n<em>jeon jungkook:</em> thirteen</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201coh my\u00a0god, kookie,\u201d jimin exclaimed, while frantically pressing buttons on the xbox controller, \u201cmy car just overtook yours!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook growled beside jimin, \u201ci was distracted, jiminnie, just you\u00a0<em>wait</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>distracted by jimin\u2019s\u00a0<em>leg</em>\u00a0which was lying on top of his, is what he didn\u2019t add.\u00a0</p>\n<p>they were seated on jungkook\u2019s couch on a saturday afternoon, enjoying playing games on the xbox. except jimin decided to,\u00a0<em>casually</em>, place his left leg over jungkook\u2019s right leg. the contact was a little\u00a0<em>too</em>\u00a0distracting for jungkook. they were both wearing shorts, and the feeling of jimin\u2019s leg\u2019s soft skin against jungkook\u2019s made jungkook\u2019s heart skip a thousand beats.\u00a0<em>you shouldn\u2019t be feeling this way,\u00a0</em>jungkook told himself.\u00a0<em>jimin is your best friend.\u00a0</em>but jungkook knew he had\u00a0<em>always</em>\u00a0felt this way, and at this point, he felt too strongly to let go of it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cstop making excuses, you\u00a0coconut. what\u2019s there here to even distract you?\u201d jimin laughed, while still desperately pressing buttons on the controller with his eyes glued to the television screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>you. you\u2019re here to distract me. your leg on top of mine is here to distract me.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>but jungkook\u2019s competitiveness took over. he pushed jimin\u2019s leg off his own, earning a \u201cwhat\u2019d you do <em>that</em>\u00a0for?\u201d from jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyour leg was so heavy, it got annoying,\u201d jungkook lied, and continued to play using all of his concentration, especially since the 'distraction' was finally gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>with jungkook\u2019s head in the game, he easily overtook jimin\u2019s race car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chey!\u201d jimin squealed at the sight of jungkook\u2019s car overtaking his.</p>\n<p>jungkook laughed at how <em>cute</em> jimin sounded. jungkook finished off the race, earning himself a golden trophy in the game for finishing in first place. jungkook placed his controller on the side and looked at jimin. jimin\u2019s eyebrows were scrunched up together and he was melodramatically pouting with his plump red lips. his cheeks looked so squishy; jungkook just wanted to\u00a0<em>eat</em>\u00a0them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook laughed at the sight, and jimin looked up at him, flaring his nostrils in annoyance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook brought his hand towards jimin\u2019s soft cheek and gave it a pull. \u201cyou\u2019re so\u00a0cute, chim chim. don\u2019t worry, next time i\u2019ll go easy on you, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin swatted jungkook\u2019s hand away and grumbled, \u201cshut up, kookie.\u201d but he was suppressing a smile. just the sight of jungkook\u2019s bunny smile was enough to make jimin giggle. also, jimin couldn\u2019t help but find it\u00a0<em>cool</em>\u00a0how his jungkook was so\u00a0<em>good</em>\u00a0at everything. despite that, jimin would still like to win against jungkook at least once in a while, not counting the times jungkook would\u00a0<em>let</em>\u00a0him win, on the days which jimin seemed tired or troubled. jimin thought it was sweet of jungkook to let him win, but now jimin had grown up too much to fall for jungkook\u2019s pretence of letting him win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin, out of the blue, began to tickle attack jungkook, having an urge to see jungkook\u2019s bunny teeth again <em>and</em>\u00a0having the urge to annoy him as he had beat jimin in the game\u00a0again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cs-stop...stop hyung,\u201d jungkook managed to scream out in the middle of his uncontrollable laughter. jimin\u2019s small hands were all over jungkook\u2019s neck. jimin was, too, laughing along with jungkook, seeking too much pleasure in seeing jungkook having lost control. jungkook\u2019s laughter warmed jimin\u2019s heart. it made the losing worth it.\u00a0<em>it made everything worth it.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>jimin continued to tickle jungkook, and in a matter of few seconds, when jimin was least expecting it, jungkook grabbed hold of jimin\u2019s wrists and pushed jimin onto the couch. jungkook pinned jimin\u2019s arms over jimin\u2019s head while jimin lay on his back with jungkook towering over him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt jungkook\u2019s breath fan his face. jungkook was so\u00a0<em>close</em>. jimin\u2019s heart raced at the speed of light. he visibly gulped. he wondered if his best friend should be making him feel\u00a0<em>this</em>\u00a0way. he should\u2019ve felt intimidated by jungkook having him pinned down to the couch. but he felt so\u00a0<em>protected</em>\u00a0under jungkook.\u00a0so <em>safe</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook breathlessly whispered, eyes not leaving jimin\u2019s, \u201ci told you to stop, hyung. i don\u2019t like to be tickled, you know it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cs-sorry,\u201d jimin whispered back, letting out a soft giggle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook grinned at the sight, and jimin\u2019s heart melted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s eyes travelled to jimin\u2019s shoulder, which was now exposed due to his tee-shirt\u2019s neckline having moved below his shoulder slightly. there was a faint bruise on jimin\u2019s shoulder, making jungkook frown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin was confused by jungkook\u2019s sudden stiffness. jungkook\u2019s smile had vanished and he had started to sit up, leaving jimin\u2019s wrists. jimin sat up too, confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat...what happened?\u201d jimin asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes followed jungkook\u2019s gaze, only to find that jungkook was staring at his...<em>shoulder</em>? jimin frowned,\u00a0and then realised.\u00a0he quickly pulled his tee shirt back up on his shoulder. his face heated up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cah,\u00a0that,\u201d jimin nervously laughed. \u201ci fell down and got hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was silent for a few seconds, and he took this time to stare right into jimin\u2019s eyes. jimin\u2019s breath hitched and he quickly looked away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cthat doesn\u2019t look like a bruise from having fallen down, minnie,\u201d jungkook whispered. \u201cyou...you do know you can tell me if someone...if someone is hurting you, right? you can tell me\u00a0everything. you...you <em>should</em>\u00a0tell me everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin gulped, face still red.</p>\n<p>\u201ci know i can, kookie,\u201d jimin gave him a strained smile. \u201ci tell you everything and you know that. let this be. please?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook took both of jimin\u2019s hands in his. jimin felt so protected at the feeling of his smaller hands being enveloped by jungkook\u2019s larger ones. but he couldn\u2019t tell jungkook about how he got the bruise.\u00a0<em>it would worry jungkook too much</em>. it wasn\u2019t even a big deal, jimin told himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cjimin,\u00a0<em>please</em>, tell me who did this to you? i promise i won\u2019t confront them or talk to them about this. they won\u2019t even know that i know!\u201d\u00a0<em>oh, they\u2019ll know, they\u2019ll never forget having hurt my sunshine,\u00a0</em>jungkook thought to himself, feeling anger seep into his veins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>after half an hour of jungkook\u2019s non-stop asking and promising that he won\u2019t take any action against the person, jimin revealed who gave him the bruise. it was a boy from jimin\u2019s grade, mingyu, who decided to push jimin against a wall a week ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the truth is that, since jimin had become friends with jungkook three years ago, jungkook being the strong and intimidating boy who was good at\u00a0<em>everything</em>, no one had dared to hurt jimin. jimin often got snickers and comments when jungkook wasn\u2019t present, but no one had actually laid their hand on jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>last week had been different. after jimin had finished his dance practice which took place in school itself, he accidentally bumped into a particularly\u00a0<em>scary</em>\u00a0classmate, who decided to take his anger out on him. that\u2019s how it was, the strong preyed on the weak, took their anger and frustration out on the ones smaller and weaker than them.\u00a0mingyu had screamed at jimin for not even knowing how to walk straight, and he had pushed jimin against a wall. when jimin had told him that he was getting hurt, mingyu had dug his fingertips into both of jimin\u2019s shoulders and told jimin to \u201cwatch it\u201d next time.</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s mouth went dry when jimin revealed the name, realising that someone actually\u00a0<em>had</em>\u00a0actually laid their hands on jimin to hurt jimin. jungkook felt himself\u00a0<em>shake</em>\u00a0with fury. but he needed to calm down in front of jimin. he took a few deep breaths and averted jimin\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cy-you won\u2019t say anything to him, right?\u201d jimin asked jungkook, fear visible in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cno, hyung, i won\u2019t,\u201d jungkook assured jimin, giving jimin\u2019s chubby hand a light squeeze.\u00a0<em>no, i won\u2019t say anything to him, hyung, i\u2019ll do worse. i\u2019ll make sure he never forgets having hurt you. i\u2019ll make sure he never even breaths in your direction again.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>a week later, news spread of mingyu\u2019s black eye and broken nose. no one knew how he got injured so badly. he claimed to have fallen from the stairs, but it was hardly plausible. jimin knew better than that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had\u00a0promised, jimin thought to himself, furious that jungkook went as far as beating mingyu up for jimin\u2019s sake. but he couldn\u2019t stay angry at jungkook for long.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2661</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>park jimin:</em> eighteen<br>\n<em>jeon jungkook:</em> sixteen</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chyung, what happened?\u201d jungkook softly asked jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin was sat on the floor in a corner of their school\u2019s library, while jungkook kneeled down in front of him. jungkook had taken a long time to find jimin, since jimin wasn\u2019t visible from any part of the library, being surrounded with rows of books.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin was supposed to meet jungkook at their school\u2019s gate, just as they did every day after their classes. but had jungkook waited for his hyung for half an hour, only to realise that something was wrong. jimin had not even been answering his calls. jungkook had felt himself panic, and he had frantically ran all around the school, screaming \u201c<em>jiminie, are you here?\u201d</em>\u00a0while earning annoyed glances from everybody around him. jungkook had finally realised that jimin would probably be seated in the library\u2013 one of his favourite places in school. but what jungkook didn\u2019t understand was why jimin was seated, not on a chair in front of one of the many tables in the library, but on the floor in a hidden corner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s fingers softly caressed jimin\u2019s cheek, and jimin continued to look at the book he was reading without paying jungkook any heed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmy cupcake, my mochi, what happened?\u201d jungkook asked again, his voice laced with affection, his fingers not leaving his best friend\u2019s cheek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin swatted jungkook\u2019s hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cgo away,\u201d jimin pleaded, still not looking up at jungkook.</p>\n<p>jungkook frowned, confused.</p>\n<p>jungkook tried to recall their interactions from the morning. it was <em>valentine\u2019s day</em>. jimin and jungkook had walked to school together, just as they did every other morning. jimin had been strangely silent through their walk, but when jungkook had asked him why, he had said that he hadn\u2019t received enough sleep at night. jungkook didn\u2019t push jimin about it, as jungkook himself wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk.\u00a0<em>he was too worried about not letting another valentine\u2019s day go past without asking jimin to be his valentine.\u00a0</em>he knew he had to let jimin know about his feelings.</p>\n<p>his emotions for jimin had completely\u00a0<em>consumed</em>\u00a0him. he <em>had</em> to let jimin know. but he didn\u2019t know\u00a0<em>how</em>. and neither did he know if jimin would return those feelings. he often found jimin blushing at his touch, or giggling at his smile, but he could never be sure of jimin\u2019s emotions. he knew jimin loved him, but there was such a thin line between loving somebody as a best friend and loving somebody as a someone you would want to\u00a0<em>date</em>. jungkook positively loved jimin as somebody he would want to date. he wanted to smother jimin with kisses. he wanted to feel jimin\u2019s plump lips against his. he wanted to\u00a0<em>bite</em>\u00a0those same plump lips. he wanted to decorate jimin\u2019s neck with marks of purple and red. he wanted to see jimin whimper under his touch.\u00a0<em>he wanted jimin</em>. he wanted jimin all to himself. he wanted to make jimin laugh, make jimin happy. he wanted to\u00a0<em>love</em>\u00a0jimin. he had always wanted to\u00a0<em>love</em>\u00a0jimin. but jimin seemed way too <em>perfect</em>\u00a0for somebody like jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook escaped his spiral of thoughts and took a seat in front of jimin. he softly lifted the book off jimin\u2019s lap and kept it aside. jimin continued to look down, now looking down at his own fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook sighed, not knowing how to get jimin to talk to him. he just couldn\u2019t bear see jimin looking so bothered, it broke his heart. he wanted to take all of jimin\u2019s pain away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook took jimin\u2019s smaller hands in his own. jimin finally looked up at jungkook. jungkook\u2019s breath hitched at the sight of jimin\u2019s eyes being slightly red and puffy.\u00a0had he been...crying?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cj-jimin, what\u2019s wrong? please\u00a0<em>talk</em>\u00a0to me. you know that i love you, you know that i\u2019ll listen to you, you know that i\u2019ll <em>understand</em>. i always do,\u201d jungkook said, trying to keep his voice calm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cthis...,\u201d jimin started, his voice soft and unsure, \u201cy-you won\u2019t understand, kookie, let it be. leave me alone. <em>please</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook angrily shook his head, \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ck-kookie please. leave my hands.\u00a0<em>go away</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook held on to jimin\u2019s wrists firmly and spoke with desperation, \u201ci\u2019m not leaving until you tell me what\u2019s happened. did somebody <em>say</em> something to you? something mean? who? <em>who</em> was it? i\u2019ll beat them up, minnie, i won\u2019t let them bother you again.\u201d<br>\n<br>\njimin was silent.<br>\n<br>\n\u201chave....<em>i</em>\u00a0done something? have i maybe\u2026<em>said</em> something? is this in any way related to...<em>me</em>?\u201d\u00a0jungkook asked, his heart hammering in his chest.</p>\n<p>jimin gulped and averted jungkook\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s...me. i did something,\u201d jungkook said slowly, realising that\u00a0<em>he\u2019</em>s the cause of jimin\u2019s sadness. jungkook felt his heart <em>break</em> into a million pieces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s mind began to play back their entire day, more carefully this time. after their walk to school, at the gate of the school, jungkook had been pulled away from jimin by a few girls. jungkook had been confused as to why these girls had pulled him away, forgetting in that moment that it was valentine\u2019s day. but before he could tell jimin that he\u2019d be back in a second, jimin had left.\u00a0<em>he probably left for his class, he was late anyway</em>, jungkook remembered thinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the girls all gave jungkook a rose each, confessing their feelings for him. jungkook had felt so\u00a0<em>uneasy</em>, he had wanted jimin by his side again. he accepted all the roses from them and told them that they were all beautiful girls with pretty smiles. though, to their disappointment, jungkook added that he had already had feelings for somebody\u00a0<em>else</em>. the girls had\u00a0looked upset, but all jungkook could think of was how he wanted to hand all the roses which he had received to <em>jimin</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>throughout the day jungkook received confessions and roses. jungkook felt flattered, but he also felt\u00a0<em>bad</em>. seeing the hurt in the eyes of all those girls made him\u00a0upset.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had always received a lot of roses on valentine\u2019s day, being <em>that</em> boy who was good at everything, <em>that</em> boy who girls swooned at when he walked passed; it had become a joke between jimin and him. every year on valentine\u2019s day, jimin would begin joking about all of jungkook\u2019s admirers and rose givers right from the time they\u2019d start their morning walk to school. but jungkook realised that jimin hadn\u2019t joked about it on this morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>did jimin\u2019s anger have anything to do with...jungkook\u2019s receiving of confessions and roses? how...how could <em>this</em> possibly affect jimin?\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook sucked in a sharp breath and began to caress jimin\u2019s hands with his own. he noticed how jimin visibly shuddered under jungkook\u2019s heavy gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdoes your behaviour have anything to do with it being...valentine\u2019s day today?\u201d jungkook asked jimin, getting straight to the point. jungkook\u00a0<em>had</em>\u00a0to know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes went wide and he immediately pulled his hands away from jungkook\u2019s grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cn-no, not at all, why would you think that?\u201d jimin spoke, his face having gone completely red.\u00a0<em>he was lying</em>. jungkook knew it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>realisation hit jungkook like a truck. jungkook took in a sharp breath. his heart began to race. could\u2026<em>could it be</em>? could it really be that jimin was...<em>jealous</em>? jungkook couldn\u2019t believe it. it couldn\u2019t be true. it was too <em>good</em>\u00a0to be true.\u00a0<em>jungkook couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>jungkook placed his finger on jimin\u2019s chin and forced jimin to look into his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cjimin, do you...do you not like the fact that i receive all these confessions?\u201d jungkook asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>panic flashed in jimin\u2019s large eyes, \u201cn-no, it\u2019s not that. it\u2019s..i..i\u2019m upset about...the fact that\u00a0<em>i</em>\u00a0don\u2019t receive any confessions.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook knew jimin <em>wasn\u2019t</em> upset about that. jimin had always expressed panic at idea of a girl confessing to him\u2014it was a conversation they\u2019d had a million times. once a girl had, a few months ago, given jimin an ounce of attention, staring at jimin during classes and leaving him a sweet note in his locker, and jimin had completely <em>freaked</em> out. he had been a sweetheart about it to the girl, not wanting to make the her feel bad, but he had told jungkook that the only person whose attention he wanted was <em>his</em>. jungkook\u2019s jealousy at the girl\u2019s note and stares had vanished away, knowing that jimin only wanted jungkook's\u00a0attention and love (\"as a friend of course,\" jimin had added, blushing after he had told jungkook that). so jungkook knew jimin was lying<em>\u00a0</em>about his reason for being upset.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook smirked and brought his face closer to jimin\u2019s. he could feel jimin\u2019s breath on his lips<em>.\u00a0</em>he wanted to feel jimin\u2019s <em>lips</em> on his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook finger remained on jimin\u2019s chin, holding jimin\u2019s face up so that jimin couldn\u2019t look down again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci think you\u2019re lying\u00a0<em>hyung</em>,\u201d jungkook smiled, now having completely realised what the issue was, having completely understood <em>why</em> jimin was upset. \u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s lips formed a pout and jimin\u2019s cheeks and ears got even more red than they were before. \u201ci\u2019m\u00a0<em>not </em>lying. why...why are you s-so\u00a0<em>close</em>? move away, kookie.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook used his left hand to pick jimin\u2019s hand up, softly, and he placed jimin\u2019s hand on his own chest. jimin frowned, confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cw-what are you doing?\u201d jimin asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdo you feel that, hyung? my heartbeat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin was silent for a moment. his eyes moved to his hand on jungkook\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes,\u201d jimin whispered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>for you</em>,\u201d jungkook whispered back, his face moving even closer to jimin\u2019s. their lips were almost touching. jungkook felt as if his heart was about to\u00a0<em>burst</em>. he continued to firmly hold jimin\u2019s hand against his chest. he wanted jimin to know what jimin did to him, the effect jimin\u2019s mere presence had on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d jimin asked, barely able to form words anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cfor you. my heart is beating so\u00a0<em>fast</em>\u00a0for you. my heart...my heart\u00a0<em>beats</em>\u00a0for you,<em>\u00a0</em>jimin. don\u2019t you...<em>understand</em>?\u201d jungkook said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook felt jimin\u2019s breathing quicken. jungkook noticed how jimin\u2019s eyes were glossy and threatened to spill tears. he noticed how jimin\u2019s eyes fell to jungkook\u2019s lips. jungkook\u2019s heart began to beat faster, if that was even possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyou...you like me? you like me as more than a\u00a0<em>friend</em>?\u201d jimin finally spoke, his watery eyes still focussed on jungkook\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes, yes i like you as <em>so</em> much more than just a friend, jimin. i\u2019ve liked you since\u2026so long. why\u2026<em>why</em> do you think i\u2019ve said no to every single girl who\u2019s confessed to me, jimin? for you, minnie. it\u2019s all for <em>you</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cr-really?\u201d jimin asked, his voice hoarse, and jungkook\u2019s heart clenched at seeing tears run down jimin\u2019s cheeks. jungkook felt his own eyes filling up with tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin continued to speak, his voice soft, \u201cj-jungkook, i\u2019ve liked you since such a long time. i never thought y\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin was\u2026<em>confessing</em>. jungkook couldn\u2019t stop himself anymore.\u00a0<em>he kissed him</em>.\u00a0he kissed him right in the middle of his confession.</p>\n<p>jungkook kissed the boy who he had been in <em>love</em> with since\u2026 a very <em>long</em>\u00a0time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>tears escaped his eyes while his lips softly pecked jimin\u2019s pink and plump lips. the lips he\u2019d wanted to feel against his since he was a little boy. jimin froze. jungkook pulled back slightly and his eyes met jimin\u2019s shocked ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwas that...not okay?\u201d jungkook asked, suddenly panicking at jimin\u2019s reaction. he never wanted to do anything which jimin wouldn\u2019t like.\u00a0<em>never ever.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cit...,\u201d jimin whispered softly and looked up at jungkook, \u201cit was okay. it was so much more than okay. kiss me. kiss me\u00a0<em>again</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook didn\u2019t waste a second. he crashed his lips against jimin\u2019s, rougher this time. the feeling of jimin\u2019s marshmallow soft lips against his own lips made him\u00a0<em>melt</em>. his hands were cupping both of jimin\u2019s cheeks, and jimin\u2019s hands were still awkwardly lying in his lap. jungkook, not breaking the kiss, took jimin\u2019s right hand and placed it on his own neck. jungkook cupped jimin\u2019s cheeks again, deepening the kiss. jungkook was pretty sure that his heart would burst any second now. jimin tasted like the popcorn he had probably been having earlier, jungkook <em>loved</em> how jimin tasted. jungkook always knew he would love it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>a low groan escaped the back of jimin\u2019s throat as jungkook nibbled on jimin\u2019s lower lip. he had always wanted to\u00a0<em>bite</em>\u00a0jimin\u2019s lower up. since the very first day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook smirked at jimin\u2019s reaction, happy to know that he was having the same effect on jimin as jimin was having on him. jungkook pushed jimin head completely against the wall and kissed jimin with even more force than before. he just couldn\u2019t stop himself. he didn\u2019t want to pull away. but jimin pushed him back softly, and jungkook immediately pulled away, yet again, not wanting to do anything which jimin wasn\u2019t liking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>their foreheads were touching and they were both breathless. jungkook\u2019s eyes frantically scanned jimin\u2019s face for his reaction, and jimin\u00a0<em>giggled</em>. he giggled and jungkook felt all his worry melt away. listening to jimin\u2019s giggle was his <em>favourite</em> thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ckookie,\u201d jimin spoke, still smiling, \u201ci pulled away because i couldn\u2019t <em>breathe</em> anymore. how much of kissing stamina do you even have? have you been lying to me? have you kissed someone before?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin had been giggling as he was speaking; jungkook knew jimin was just teasing him. but he suddenly felt the need to defend himself, \u201cwhy...why would i <em>lie</em> to you? this was my first kiss too!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201care you sure about that?\u201d jimin teased further, knowing jungkook was getting a bit worked up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes. jimin, don\u2019t you understand? i told you my heart beats only for <em>you</em>. h-how can i kiss someone else, taste someone else, when all i can seem to do is think about <em>your</em> lips and how <em>you\u2019d</em> taste.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s breath hitched at jungkook\u2019s words, not expecting jungkook to respond in that manner.\u00a0jimin cupped jungkook\u2019s face with his small hands and caressed jungkook\u2019s cheek with his thumb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ceven\u00a0<em>my</em>\u00a0heart beats only for\u00a0<em>you</em>,\u201d jimin whispered and crashed his lips against jungkook\u2019s. \u00a0</p>\n<p>they kissed. they kissed and their tongues played in each other\u2019s\u2019 mouths and they talked of how much they loved one other for\u00a0<em>hours</em>. until it was too late and the library was being shut down for the day.</p>\n<p>they ran out breathless, hands laced together, with swollen red lips and shy smiles. the librarian suppressed a snigger at how the two boys failed at being sly about their very passionate, and very long, make out session.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>park jimin:</em> twenty-one<br>\n<em>jeon jungkook:</em> nineteen<br>\n<br>\njimin was placed comfortably between his boyfriend\u2019s legs. they were both seated on the floor in front of the television in the apartment they shared together. jungkook\u2019s back was rested on a bean bag while jimin was placed in the middle of jungkook\u2019s legs, head placed on his boyfriend\u2019s sturdy and muscular chest. jungkook\u2019s arms were encircled around jimin, and jungkook held his xbox controller with his hands lazily in jimin\u2019s lap. jungkook\u2019s breath fanned over jimin\u2019s neck as they both played <em>overwatch</em>, making jimin shiver.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin couldn\u2019t believe that his boyfriend still had this kind of an effect over him. they\u2019d be dating each other for three years now, but jungkook could still, so easily, cause jimin to blush. it had nothing to do with how comfortable jimin was with jungkook. he was\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0comfortable with jungkook, after all, they had been best friends before lovers. there was absolutely no filter to how jimin acted around jungkook. jungkook knew jimin better than jimin knew himself, how could jimin not be the\u00a0<em>most</em>\u00a0comfortable around jungkook? but, the feeling of jungkook on\u00a0<em>top</em>\u00a0of him, the feeling of jungkook\u2019s\u00a0<em>strong</em>\u00a0arms pinning him down, the feeling of jungkook whispering in his ear about how he\u2019d fuck him until he couldn\u2019t\u00a0<em>walk</em>. jimin loved it. jimin loved it\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>suddenly jimin couldn\u2019t focus on the video game instructions his boyfriend was giving him from behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes were, instead, glued to jungkook\u2019s hands, which were placed in jimin\u2019s lap, frantically pressing the xbox controller\u2019s buttons. jimin gulped nervously, knowing that the sight of jungkook\u2019s large hands and slender fingers was turning him on.\u00a0<em>now is not the time</em>, he told himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbaby, what happened? you\u2019re not pressing anything... are you okay?\u201d jungkook asked, placing his chin on jimin\u2019s shoulder while trying to peak at jimin\u2019s face from the behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s felt his entire face heat up, knowing that he had completely spaced out just because of his boyfriend\u2019s warm breath on his neck\u2026just because of his boyfriend\u2019s <em>hands</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cn-nothing,\u201d jimin spoke, his voice soft, \u201ci\u2019m fine. i was just thinking about something random. let\u2019s continue playing.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cokay, love,\u201d jungkook answered, and began to play again, but he didn\u2019t move his face away from jimin\u2019s neck. his lips were softly touching jimin\u2019s neck as he desperately pressed on the controller\u2019s button while his eyes were glued to the television screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the feeling of jungkook\u2019s lips softly pressed against jimin\u2019s neck was enough to prevent jimin from concentrating. jimin tried to play, but all he could think of was the feeling of jungkook behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes moved to jungkook\u2019s large hands again. the veins in his hands were now more visible since he was harshly pressing the controller\u2019s buttons. jimin just found it so\u00a0<em>hot</em>. he gulped again, trying to control his racing mind, trying to control his\u00a0<em>dick</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>it wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t want to have sex with jungkook right now, he did, he did\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0badly, but it was just\u00a0<em>embarrassing</em>\u00a0to get hard at the sight of your boyfriend\u2019s <em>hands</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes wandered to jungkook\u2019s arms which were encircling jimin\u2019s small frame. at this point, jimin couldn\u2019t even try to hide the fact that he was staring at jungkook\u2019s arms, since he had to turn his head to do so. jungkook\u2019s arms were flexed since jungkook was holding the controller up now. oh god, his muscles, his biceps\u2026<em>his muscles</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook owned all the strength in the world. he could\u00a0<em>break</em>\u00a0jimin if he wished. but jungkook would never. jungkook would always treat jimin with the uttermost care, love and tenderness. it turned jimin on so much, knowing the sheer strength his boyfriend owned, but refused to use on him.\u00a0jungkook only used his strength to <em>protect</em> jimin.</p>\n<p>but maybe...<em>maybe</em>\u00a0jimin would <em>like</em> some of that strength being used <em>against</em> him.\u00a0jungkook was just so gentle with jimin. he\u2019d always fuck jimin into oblivion, <em>but</em>, he was also just so\u2026<em>careful</em> while doing so. jimin no longer wanted jungkook to be careful. he wanted him to be <em>rough</em>. he wanted to be manhandled by his incredibly strong boyfriend.</p>\n<p>blood rushed to his face at his thoughts. <em>and</em> blood rushed to his dick. he was hard. he was <em>so\u00a0</em>hard. and <em>embarrassed</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin had been too preoccupied by his thoughts to realise that jungkook had stopped playing again. jungkook\u2019s face now owned a confused look as he tried to look at jimin\u2019s face from behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ck-kookie why aren\u2019t you playing?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cactually, i should be asking\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0that, why aren\u2019t you playing? baby i\u2019ll ask you again, is everything alright? you spaced out again. also, your cheeks are red,\u201d jungkook said, panicking slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook placed the controller on the floor in the space between jimin\u2019s legs, with the intention of having the controller away from him so that he could pay attention to his boyfriend, but in that process, his hand brushed against jimin\u2019s crotch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes widened and his breath hitched. jungkook had felt it, jungkook had definitely felt it.\u00a0<em>jungkook knew.\u00a0</em>jimin wanted to dig a hole, crawl into it, and stay there forever. he scrunched his eyes together, not wanting to open them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cb-baby, are you...<em>hard</em>?\u201d jungkook asked, his voice soft, sounding confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci...,\u201d jimin tried to answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes?\u201d jungkook asked again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin didn\u2019t reply. his whole face was burning. he was happy that jungkook was behind him and that he wasn\u2019t facing jungkook. though, this changed in a matter of a few seconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook placed his hands on jimin\u2019s waist and twisted jimin around a bit, motioning for jimin to face him. jimin refused to move, but jungkook was strong, jungkook was <em>so</em> strong.\u00a0before jimin could understand what was happening, jungkook had lifted jimin and switched their positions, throwing jimin under himself while now hovering over jimin.\u00a0jimin felt uncomfortable to be lying down on the floor, but the feeling of jungkook straddling his hips and pinning down his wrists had him feeling on as if he were on\u00a0<em>fire</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cj-jungkook, what are you doing?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook smirked and brought his lips close to jimin\u2019s ear, whispering to jimin in a low and husky voice, \u201cdid your spacing out during the game again and again have anything to do with your little...<em>situation </em>down there?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin gulped. yes. yes it did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cuh...,\u201d jimin awkwardly replied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin tried to free his hands from jungkook\u2019s grip. he wanted to cover his face with his hands, but jungkook held jimin\u2019s wrists even more forcefully after seeing him struggle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin gulped at how jungkook\u2019s grip was so strong and forceful, yet gentle. yet\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0gentle. it made his heart flutter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but today, but today didn\u2019t want jungkook to be gentle. he loved it when his boyfriend was gentle. he loved his when his boyfriend made love to him with all the tenderness in the world. he loved it when his boyfriend treated him as if he were made of\u00a0<em>glass</em>. as if he could\u00a0<em>break</em>. but today, he\u00a0<em>wanted</em>\u00a0jungkook to break him. to wreck him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook let out a low growl in jimin\u2019s ear, turning jimin on even more, if that was even possible at this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmy love, if you don\u2019t tell me what you want us to do, what you want\u00a0<em>me</em>\u00a0to do, i can\u2019t do anything,\u201d jungkook whispered, his left hand making its way to jimin\u2019s crotch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s face remained close to jimin\u2019s, but his hand began to palm jimin through jimin\u2019s sweatpants. the movement was slow, and instead of helping jimin\u2019s painfully hard dick, it just...it just made it\u00a0<em>worse</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cj-jungkook,\u201d jimin whimpered as jungkook rubbed jimin\u2019s dick with his hand, his\u00a0<em>large</em>\u00a0hand, from on top of jimin\u2019s sweatpants.</p>\n<p>\u201cyes, my love?\u201d jungkook smirked, continuing his slow and steady hand movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci...i need\u00a0<em>more</em>,\u201d jimin spoke, and then let out a particularly <em>loud</em> moan as jungkook sped up his movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201clike this, baby?\u201d jungkook asked, and he continued palming jimin.</p>\n<p>jimin was taking <em>too</em> much pleasure from jungkook\u2019s fast movements to be able to reply. there was a look of absolute\u00a0<em>bliss</em>\u00a0of his face. he let his soft mewls answer jungkook\u2019s question instead. how could jungkook\u2019s hands, even just from on top of his pants, have him <em>this</em> far gone?\u00a0</p>\n<p>suddenly, it wasn\u2019t enough. he wanted more. he wanted it\u00a0<em>rougher</em>. and he wanted jungkook\u00a0<em>inside</em>\u00a0him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ck-kookie,\u201d jimin whimpered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook slowed down his hands\u2019 movements again, his eyes focussed on jimin\u2019s face now, \u201cyes, baby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci need m-more. i need you. i need you\u00a0<em>inside</em>\u00a0me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook tried to supress his amused smile at the sight of his boyfriend being so <em>needy</em> for him. he brought his lips to jimin\u2019s neck and pressed gentle kisses across his soft skin. but the gentle kisses turned into\u00a0<em>bites</em>\u00a0almost immediately. jimin\u2019s skin was too...too delicious for him to control himself.\u00a0jimin\u2019s soft kitten-like whimpers had jungkook\u2019s dick twitching in anticipation.</p>\n<p>\u201ck-kookie please,\u201d jimin said in between of his moans, \u201cb-bedroom.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook couldn\u2019t deprive his boyfriend of what he was asking for. jungkook didn\u2019t <em>ever</em> want to deprive jimin of what he was asking for.</p>\n<p>jungkook\u00a0<em>wanted</em>\u00a0to be inside his boyfriend. he wanted to feel jimin around his dick. he wanted to hear jimin\u00a0<em>scream</em>\u00a0for him. he wanted to his come to leak out of jimin\u2019s pretty little asshole. he wanted it, he wanted it all\u00a0<em>badly</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>in a swift motion, jungkook had lifted jimin off the ground. jimin\u2019s eyes went wide, not having expected it. jungkook hoisted jimin up in his arms and jimin wrapped his legs around jungkook\u2019s waist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook continued to bite into jimin\u2019s neck as he carried him to their bedroom. and jimin continued to let out soft whimpers while breathing heavily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook gently placed jimin on their bed, despite his urge to roughly throw jimin on the bed and <em>tear</em> off jimin\u2019s clothes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>he could never be too rough with his precious and small boyfriend. little did he know that jimin\u00a0<em>wanted</em>\u00a0him to be rough, wanted jungkook to\u00a0<em>wreck </em>him just as much as jungkook wanted to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cn-not the b-bed,\u201d jimin whispered while helping jungkook take off both of their tee-shirts.</p>\n<p>jungkook frowned, \u201cthen where, baby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cw-wall, i want you to lift me up against the w-wall,\u201d jimin said. as soon as the words were out of jimin\u2019s mouth, jimin felt himself blushing. he bit into his lip shyly and attempted to hide his face with his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but jungkook immediately lifted jimin off the bed, not giving jimin any time to be shy. the next thing jimin knew was that he was being pushed against their bedroom\u2019s wall, his legs still wrapped around jungkook\u2019s waist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>how could jungkook lift him so\u00a0<em>easily</em>, as if jimin were as light as a feather? jimin\u2019s eyes travelled to jungkook\u2019s biceps, his very toned and very much <em>flexed</em> biceps, and\u00a0<em>oh boy</em>, jimin let out an actual\u00a0<em>groan</em>\u00a0at the sight of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook saw this. jungkook\u00a0<em>obviously</em>\u00a0saw this. jungkook smirked, amusement taking over him, and used his hands to unwrap jimin\u2019s legs from around his waist. jimin now stood on his own two feet with jungkook having caged him against the wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s hands pinned jimin\u2019s wrists to the wall and he placed his forehead on jimin\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cis it my arms? is it my arms which are turning you on? my\u00a0<em>muscles</em>? is that was you were busy noticing while we were playing on the xbox?\u201d jungkook asked, his voice deep and hoarse.</p>\n<p>jimin wanted to deny it, but he no longer felt as shy.</p>\n<p>\u201cy-yes,\u201d jimin whispered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci see,\u201d jungkook said, supressing a pleased smile, and crashed his lips against jimin\u2019s strawberry red ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>he slipped his tongue into jimin\u2019s mouth, earning a soft moan from jimin. he felt his own dick harden even <em>more</em> because of the sound of jimin\u2019s moans. their tongues explored each other\u2019s\u2019 mouths and their kiss drowned out the sound of their moans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook began to nibble on jimin\u2019s lower lip, drawing a bit of blood. jimin let out a delighted whine at this. after all, he\u00a0<em>loved</em>\u00a0it when jungkook bit him, especially when he bit him a little\u00a0<em>too</em>\u00a0hard. jungkook immediately ran his tongue over jimin\u2019s lip, wanting to soothe the pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled back slightly, breathing heavily, \u201cwhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes met jungkook\u2019s dark ones. jungkook\u2019s eyes looked so determined, so\u00a0<em>hungry</em>, so hungry for jimin. jimin felt his heart beat even faster at jungkook\u2019s lustful gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci...,\u201d jimin started, not wanting to speak further. should he, <em>should he\u2026</em> tell jungkook what he wanted, what he\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0wanted?\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s caressed jimin\u2019s cheek softly with his hand.\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t be shy, my love, what do you want? tell me, i\u2019ll give you anything you want,\u201d jungkook paused. he let out a hungry growl and added, \u201ci\u2019ll give you <em>everything</em> you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci...,\u201d jimin whispered, jungkook\u2019s words giving him the courage, \u201ci\u2026 i want\u00a0<em>you</em>. i want you to...i want you to\u00a0<em>wreck</em>\u00a0me. to be rough with me. i want you to do anything which <em>you</em> want to do with me. i don\u2019t...i don\u2019t want you to\u00a0<em>worry</em>\u00a0about me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook sucked in a sharp breath. wrecking jimin was all he ever wanted to do, \u201cbut baby, i don\u2019t want to be too rough, i don\u2019t want to...<em>hurt</em>\u00a0you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbut <em>i</em> want you to be rough. i want you to be\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0rough,\u201d jimin said, his words louder and more assertive this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201caren\u2019t you,\u201d jimin seductively whispered, \u201cgoing to give me what i want?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cfuck,\u201d jungkook said, eyes darkening. hunger took over every inch of his being. \u201c<em>fuck</em>, you\u2019re so hot jimin, fucking hell,\u00a0<em>yes</em>, i\u2019ll give you what you want. i\u2019ll give you\u00a0<em>exactly</em>\u00a0what you want.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s teeth bit into jimin\u2019s neck. jimin let out a muffled scream at the sudden action. jungkook wanted to leave marks of purple and red all across jimin\u2019s neck; he wanted to claim jimin. jimin was\u00a0<em>his</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmine, mine,\u00a0<em>mine</em>,\u201d jungkook growled in the middle of each kiss, in the middle of each\u00a0<em>bite</em>. he ran his tongue over the places on jimin\u2019s soft milky white neck which he had bitten. \u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s small hands clutched onto jungkook\u2019s biceps as jungkook devoured the skin on his neck. he let out moans of pain, moans of <em>pleasure</em>. jungkook didn\u2019t stop. and jimin didn\u2019t want him to stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s hand fumbled with jimin\u2019s sweatpants as he tried to pull them down while continuing to leave marks on jimin\u2019s neck. he finally managed to pull jimin\u2019s pants down. his eyes made their way to jimin\u2019s painfully hard dick, which was still covered with jimin\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p>\u201cturn around,\u201d jungkook ordered jimin, his voice assertive and raspy,\u00a0<em>just how jimin liked it.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201co-okay,\u201d jimin whimpered softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>he turned around, now facing the wall. jimin suddenly felt jungkook\u2019s presence leave him from behind him. jimin turned out, confused, only to find that jungkook was still behind jimin, but he was on his knees, looking up at jimin with hungry eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cb-babe what are you doing?\u201d jimin asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201clook in front, <em>kitten</em>. i\u2019ll make you feel good. i\u2019ll make you feel <em>so</em> good. just do as i say,\u201d jungkook said, words loud and clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin shuddered at his assertive tone and obeyed his boyfriend, now staring at the white wall in front of him. jimin felt jittery and excited all over, not knowing what his boyfriend was about to do next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook hooked his fingers into the waistband of jimin\u2019s underwear and pulled his underwear down. he used his hands to spread jimin\u2019s ass cheeks in order to get a clear view of jimin\u2019s pink hole which was clenching itself, as if needy for jungkook\u2019s cock.\u00a0the sight of jimin\u2019s pretty little hole clenching for jungkook was enough to make jungkook groan as heat pooled into his stomach.</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s let out a high-pitched scream when he felt something <em>soft</em> and <em>wet</em> come in contact his hole. his eyes widened at the realisation of it being jungkook\u2019s <em>tongue</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook softly licked jimin\u2019s hole from the outside. jimin\u2019s knees buckled at the sensation, and jungkook had to use both of his hands to hold onto jimin\u2019s thighs to ensure that jimin stood straight without falling down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled back and said, \u201cbaby, i\u2019ll have to hold your legs for you, i don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to stand otherwise. but please just use both of your hands to spread your cute ass-cheeks for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin gulped, pre-cum dripping from his cock even at the very feeling of jungkook\u2019s strong hands holding him up, making sure that he wouldn\u2019t fall while jungkook ate his ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cokay,\u201d jimin whimpered, and used both of his hands to spread his cheeks for jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s tongue dove right into jimin\u2019s hole, causing another mewl to leave jimin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cf-feels so <em>g-good</em> k-kookie,\u201d jimin managed to say in the middle of his breathy moans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s tongue went in deeper, fucking jimin with it as harshly as he could. jimin\u2019s high pitched moans were enough to want to <em>eat</em> jimin up completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cd-do that again kookie, right\u00a0<em>there</em>, again,\u201d jimin pleaded, eyes clenched together, and jungkook repeated his action.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had to use all his force to hold jimin\u2019s thighs, since jimin now had absolutely <em>zero</em> control over his legs. the pleasure was too much for jimin to think straight, for jimin to <em>stand</em> straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cj-jungkook i...i want you inside me. i want you to\u00a0<em>fuck</em>\u00a0me. y-your tongue isn\u2019t enough anymore, p-please fill me up, fill me up,\u201d jimin whined and pleaded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled back and smiled. he gave jimin\u2019s hole one last lick before he thrusted\u00a0his index and middle finger inside it. jimin let out a high-pitched\u00a0<em>scream</em>, not expecting jungkook\u2019s fingers to enter him with such force.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was now holding jimin up with only one hand, the other being used to finger jimin. jimin\u2019s knees buckled. jimin realised that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand with just one of jungkook\u2019s hands supporting him. jungkook was definitely strong enough to hold him up with one hand, and jimin found that so\u00a0<em>hot</em>, but jimin didn\u2019t want to strain his boyfriend too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ck-kookie,\u00a0<em>wait</em>,\u201d jimin said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook immediately stopped. he pulled his fingers out of jimin and stood up. he twisted jimin around to make jimin face him and while he stared right into jimin\u2019s eyes, \u201cbaby, what happened, did i hurt you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s breath hitched. he found it<em>\u00a0</em>to be such a turn on<em>\u00a0</em>that jungkook owned all the power in the world to wreck jimin, and yet, the second jimin told him to wait, jungkook stopped everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin giggled, \u201ckookie! i already told you not to feel scared of hurting me. i was just telling you to wait so that i could adjust myself, and also, i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll be able to\u00a0<em>stand</em>\u00a0while you do\u00a0<em>that </em>to me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook let out a sigh of relief and jimin dragged jungkook to the bed. jimin placed himself on all fours and jungkook wasted no time to continue fingering him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pushed two of his fingers into jimin and began to scissor jimin\u2019s hole, trying to stretch it, getting it ready for his large, and very\u00a0<em>hard</em>, cock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s long and slender fingers were filling jimin up just as he liked it. his fingers were scissoring jimin with so much of force, at such a <em>fast</em> pace. jimin\u00a0<em>loved</em>\u00a0it. jimin wanted more, he wanted more, he wanted m-</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s entire body jerked forward and he let out the loudest possible gasp. jungkook immediately knew that he had brushed against jimin\u2019s prostate, against jimin\u2019s sensitive bundle of nerves. jungkook continued to press against it with his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\u201cj-jungkook</em>,\u201d jimin cried out, tears filling up his eyes at the feeling of his sensitive spot being pressed, \u201cd-don\u2019t stop<em>, please</em>!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pressed against jimin\u2019s prostate even harder, now bringing his lips next to jimin\u2019s ear while his chest being pressed up against jimin\u2019s back, \u201cis my kitten liking this?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>yes</em>!\u201d jimin screamed and let out a choked sob. \u201ci need your cock inside me, please jungkook, your fingers aren\u2019t enough anymore. <em>please</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled his fingers out of jimin\u2019s clenching hole, and jimin let out a needy whine at the emptiness. he needed jungkook\u2019s cock to fill him up\u00a0<em>now</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cj-jungkook,\u00a0<em>fuck me</em>,\u201d jimin whined.</p>\n<p>jungkook roughly flipped jimin over, jimin\u2019s back now pressed against the mattress while jungkook hovered over him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook gave jimin a hungry kiss and bit his lip again, making jimin groan into the kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chow badly do you want it?\u201d jungkook breathed into jimin\u2019s mouth, \u201ctell me,\u00a0<em>baby boy</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin shivered at the use of the nickname which jungkook used while they were in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201ci want it so bad, jungkook,\u201d jimin whispered, breathless. \u201ci-i need you to fuck me, i need you to wreck me, i need you to fill me up with your come, <em>i need you</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook groaned at the sound of jimin\u2019s begging, \u201ctell me you\u2019re\u00a0<em>mine</em>, tell me that you\u2019ll\u00a0<em>always</em>\u00a0be mine. tell me that you won\u2019t ever allow anybody to even lay a fucking finger on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cn-no one will ever be allowed to touch me baby, no one but y-you. i\u2019m\u00a0<em>yours</em>, baby, i\u2019ll always be yours,\u201d jimin whimpered, speaking nothing but the truth, but also wanting jungkook to fuck him already. jungkook swiftly took off his own pants and underwear and threw them across the room. he then bent down to reach jimin\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cand i\u2019m all\u00a0<em>yours</em>\u00a0too,\u201d jungkook spoke in a low voice into jimin\u2019s ear, and before jimin knew it, jungkook had lifted jimin off the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin quickly wrapped his legs around jungkook\u2019s waist, his dick being pressed against jungkook\u2019s muscular chest. jungkook carried jimin off the bed and walked towards the wall that they were previously against. but jimin was getting too impatient. he began to <em>move </em>his hips, in order for his dick to get some kind of relief by being rubbed against his boyfriend\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s back met the wall harshly and jimin sucked in a sharp breath at the sudden contact. jimin\u2019s legs remained wrapped around jungkook\u2019s waist and jungkook\u2019s muscular arms held jimin by his thighs. even the sight of jungkook holding jimin up this way made heat pool in jimin\u2019s stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cgetting impatient, are we, kitten?\u201d jungkook spoke, how voice low and raspy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cy-yes, fuck me already,\u201d jimin whined, all shame gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook growled, \u201ci\u2019ll fuck you <em>so</em> hard and <em>so</em> good that you\u2019ll be limping to your classes tomorrow, baby boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin let out an eager nod and a breathy, \u201c<em>yes</em>\u201d at jungkook\u2019s words, unable to formulate proper words at the idea of jungkook fucking him senseless. jungkook used his right hand to spread lube across his own cock. it was only his left arm and the support of the wall which held jimin up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re taking so <em>long</em>, kookie,\u201d jimin whined again, \u201cmaking me wait so much, baby, please, i need you to fuck me, fuck me senseless, fuck me until i can\u2019t walk, fuck me till i see sta-\u201c</p>\n<p>in one swift motion, jungkook\u2019s cock was inside jimin. jimin\u2019s breath hitched and he clutched onto jungkook\u2019s biceps for his dear life, \u201c<em>j-jungkook</em>!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook repositioned his hands, now gripping onto jimin\u2019s thighs, in order to hold jimin up against the wall. jimin was practically bent into half as jungkook thrusted into him, filling jimin up so\u00a0<em>deep</em>. jungkook let out a loud moan at the feeling his own cock being so sinfully and perfectly surrounded by jimin\u2019s tight hole. it felt so\u00a0<em>good</em>. he wanted to fuck jimin all day and night. he\u00a0<em>never</em>\u00a0wanted to stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cis this what you wanted?\u201d jungkook panted out in the middle of a deep groan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes, yes, y-\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook thrusted up again, making jimin let out such <em>loud</em> scream right in the middle of his own words. a tear spilled out of one of jimin\u2019s eyes, \u201cfaster, kookie,\u00a0<em>faster</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook obeyed. and in no time, he had jimin seeing stars. jungkook\u2019s cock was relentlessly hitting against jimin\u2019s prostate. jimin could no longer <em>speak</em>. he buried his head into the crook of jungkook\u2019s neck and sobbed out in pleasure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook continued to fuck jimin at an animalistic pace, not giving jimin time to\u00a0<em>breathe</em>. no even giving\u00a0<em>himself</em>\u00a0the time to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cjungkook, jungkook, jungkook...,\u201d jimin repeated like a mantra, the only thing he could manage to say while being in the state of complete euphoria. his head was spinning, he couldn\u2019t even <em>feel</em> his legs, and he was pretty sure he was drooling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>but jungkook held on to him. jungkook\u2019s firm grip remained on jimin, holding him up, thrusting into him, wrecking him, giving them both <em>exactly</em> what they wanted.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\n\u201csuch a good boy, baby, such a good boy just for <em>me</em>,\u201d jungkook said, breathless now.<br>\n<br>\n\u201co-only for you, kookie,\u201d jimin managed to say, while his face was still buried in the crook of jungkook\u2019s neck as he sobbed. there was just so much of heat and pleasure pooling into jungkook\u2019s stomach, he couldn\u2019t help but go even faster, hitting jimin\u2019s prostate at each thrust.</p>\n<p>\u201ci-i\u2019m so close,\u201d jimin whimpered in the middle of his cries and screams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook was pretty sure their <em>entire building</em> could hear jimin\u2019s screams and jungkook\u2019s loud grunts and moans. but he didn\u2019t care. <em>they</em> didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbaby boy, <em>come for me</em>,\u201d jungkook said, feeling so much of pleasure buzz through his entire body, knowing that he was just as close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cy-you too, kookie, c-come inside me. f-fill me up with your come,\u201d jimin whispered into jungkook\u2019s ear and then bit into jungkook\u2019s shoulder as jungkook increased his pace, hitting jimin\u2019s prostate with each and every painfully delightful thrust.\u00a0</p>\n<p>tears rolled down jimin\u2019s eyes. he gripped onto jungkook\u2019s arms and whined.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m s-so close, i\u2019m going to come any s-second, kookie, don\u2019t sto-\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s orgasm hit him like <em>nothing</em> he had ever felt before. jimin could no longer <em>see</em>, only <em>feel</em>. jimin began to let out one of the loudest sobs which jungkook had ever heard. his body began to tremble and his head rolled back. jimin\u2019s come splattered out on top of both of their stomachs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook continued to fuck jimin into oblivion while jimin\u2019s orgasm rolled out. seeing jimin so far gone because of jungkook\u2019s own work was enough to make jungkook orgasm. jungkook orgasmed even harder, his whole body pulsing as his come filled up jimin\u2019s hole. there was just so <em>much</em> of it, jimin felt it trickling down his thighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin could no longer keep his legs wrapped around jungkook\u2019s waist, he was too worn out to do so, his body still trembling slightly from his orgasm. jimin\u2019s legs unwrapped themselves from jungkook\u2019s waist, but jungkook held jimin\u2019s waist tightly to make sure that jimin wouldn\u2019t fall while trying to stand on his two legs. jimin\u2019s knees buckled but jungkook was there to hold him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook, despite being a panting mess and having used up all his energy, quickly lifted jimin up, bridal style, and placed him on their bed. jungkook lay down beside jimin, both on their sides facing each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s hand made its way to jungkook\u2019s face. he rested his hand upon his boyfriend\u2019s cheek and whispered, \u201ci love you, kookie, thank you for...<em>that</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook affectionately laughed at his boyfriend, \u201care you seriously thanking <em>me</em>? thank <em>you</em>, baby, you were so good for me. you took me so well, you made me feel so good. i-i just hope i wasn\u2019t <em>too</em> rough, baby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cno, oh god, not at <em>all</em>,\u201d jimin smiled, his hand now caressing jungkook\u2019s muscular arm. \u201cmaybe next time,\u201d jimin paused, and gave jungkook a seductive look, \u201cyou could...<em>blindfold</em> me and fuck me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook grabbed jimin\u2019s waist pulled jimin on top of himself, smashing their lips together. he gave jimin a passionate kiss and pulled away, \u201cnever knew you were <em>this</em> kinky, my baby boy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t act like you aren\u2019t liking it,\u201d jimin laughed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201coh, i\u2019m <em>loving</em> it. i love how you...trust me. trust me to do <em>anything</em> to you. anything with you. i- i just...it makes me happy, jimin, having you trust me this way makes me so happy,\u201d jungkook spoke, being completely honest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci love it when you take control with me, when you fuck me relentlessly,\u201d jimin opened up about how he felt, \u201cit makes me feel so <em>wanted</em>, so <em>used</em>, in a good way. i trust you with my life, kookie. i know you\u2019ll always protect me, take care of me. and honestly, your strength is <em>such</em> a turn on for me, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci always knew that, jiminie,\u201d jungkook smirked, \u201cwas just waiting for you to ask me to use that very strength against you. i\u2019ll always only do what you ask me to, baby. <em>i love you</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci love you too, baby, <em>so</em> much\u201d jimin beamed and pecked his boyfriend on the lips.\u00a0he pulled away and whispered against jungkook\u2019s red and swollen lips, \u201cbut next time in bed, what i want is\u2026is for <em>you</em> to order me around. i want to do just as you tell me. i want to be your <em>kitten</em>, your pet, it turns me on <em>so</em> much.\u201d<br>\n<br>\njungkook felt his breathing quicken, \u201cb-baby you\u2019re making me want to go in for another round right now.\u201d<br>\n<br>\njimin giggled, \u201ci don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\n<br>\njungkook grinned and pulled his boyfriend down for yet another rough kiss,\u00a0nibbling on the same spot which he had bitten a while ago. jungkook pulled away, breathless, and whispered, \u201coh, just you wait for tonight, my love. let\u2019s go and finish our game of <em>overwatch</em>, study, and then eat our dinner, okay? after that\u2026after that, you\u2019re all <em>mine</em> again,\u201d jungkook growled.<br>\n<br>\njimin shuddered and\u00a0softly smiled, \u201cwhat are you going to do to me?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cgoing to\u2026,\u201d jungkook brushed his thumb over jimin\u2019s swollen, plump red lips, \u201cgoing to put these gorgeous lips to good use. going to make you beg for it. going to have you screaming again.\u201d<br>\n<br>\njimin\u2019s smile widened and he gulped in anticipation. jungkook wrapped his arms around jimin, and jimin placed his head on his boyfriend\u2019s chest, now able to hear jungkook\u2019s racing heart. <em>for me, </em>jimin realised and smiled, <em>his beats purely for me</em>. and <em>so does mine</em>, jimin thought to himself. he closed his eyes, listening to jungkook\u2019s heartbeat, thinking about how some day, their hearts\u00a0would beat not only for each other, but also for their <em>children</em>.\u00a0jimin smiled at the idea of starting a family with jungkook, of them both being <em>fathers</em>. oh, how they'd smother their children with love and giggles. <em>little did\u00a0jimin know, jungkook was thinking about the exact same thing.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>park jimin</em>: twenty six<br>\n<em>jeon jungkook</em>: twenty four</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin securely held jisu in his arms while they stood in the queue to buy tickets for the amusement park which was located in their city. a sudden urge to squish his daughter\u2019s cheeks took over him when his eyes landed on her impatient pout. they had been standing for a whole half-an-hour now, simply waiting for their turn to arrive at the ticket booth. he could completely understand her frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cappa,\u201d jisu frowned, puffing up her cheeks, \u201ci\u2019m tired of waiting. i\u2019m\u2026i\u2019m so excited for the rides, i don\u2019t want to wait more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cnot much longer, my baby,\u201d jimin cooed as he stroked his six-year-old daughter\u2019s cheek. \u201conce we\u2019re in the park, we\u2019ll do your favourite spinning cup ride first, how does that sound?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>her face lit up, all sources of impatience and annoyance leaving her. it was just so <em>easy</em> to bring a smile upon her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re the\u00a0<em>best</em>, appa!\u201d she squealed out and gave jimin a bright smile. his heart melted.\u00a0<em>she kind of has jungkook\u2019s bunny smile,</em>\u00a0he thought to himself and supressed a smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook and jimin had adopted jisu just a year ago. jisu had been five years old and she had been living in an orphanage. jimin still remembered entering the orphanage, giddy at the idea of leaving with a child who jungkook and him would pour out their hearts to. the orphanage had so <em>many</em> children, all of them playing and laughing together, but jungkook had tugged his husband\u2019s sleeve at the sight of <em>jisu</em>. jisu had been sitting in a corner, busy with her colouring book.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the orphanage had already matched jimin and jungkook up with jisu after they had been approved as a couple who could adopt a child. it had taken <em>weeks</em> of paperwork and interviews to get themselves approved as parents, but jimin knew that it would all be worth it...each and every second of it would be\u00a0<em>worth it</em>. the owner of the orphanage had finally called jungkook and jimin to the orphanage to meet jisu. she had told them to find jisu themselves, using their memory of jisu\u2019s picture which had been shown to them, amongst the large room of occupied, playing children.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cjimin, she\u2019s so\u00a0<em>cute</em>,\u201d jungkook had whispered to jimin, eyes glinting with adoration and excitement. \u201cshe reminds me of you, baby. remember the way you would sit and colour in your colouring book as a child? she really, <em>really</em> reminds me of you!\u201d</p>\n<p>before jimin could respond, jungkook had started sprinting towards jisu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t get too excited in front of her, we don\u2019t want to scare her!\u201d jimin had said, but jungkook had already gone too far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin had then walked towards the corner of the room, where jungkook had run off to sit next to jisu. jimin gave all the children he passed a warm smile.\u00a0children just made him so <em>happy; </em>the innocence in their eyes had always warmed his heart. jimin stood in front of jisu and jungkook, both of them seated on the floor. jisu was even\u00a0<em>cuter</em>\u00a0up close. she was still busy colouring as jungkook sat beside her, looking at her in awe. she was fumbling with her crayons.\u00a0<em>her hands are so small,</em>\u00a0jimin thought to himself and his heart pained in his chest at the sight; it was too endearing for him to bear. jimin crouched down in front of her, noticing her chubby cheeks and jet-black hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chi,\u201d jimin had smiled, causing for her to look up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin felt himself smile even <em>harder</em> at the sight of her large black doe eyes meeting his. jimin glanced at jungkook, who was still sat on the floor towards her right, and was looking at her with just as much of love, mouth open slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ch-hi,\u201d she had replied, voice soft and curious, \u201cwho are you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwe...,\u201d jimin motioned towards jungkook and himself, fumbling with his words, \u201ca-are...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwe\u2019re your new\u00a0<em>friends</em>!\u201d jungkook had beamed, causing her to now look towards him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>she had given them a confused frown, \u201cw-why would you want to be my friend?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin had asked jungkook the\u00a0<em>same</em>\u00a0thing during <em>their</em> first conversation which took place under the shade of a tree of their school\u2019s playground. jimin felt his heart clench at the memory, at the very <em>precious</em> memory, which he would\u2019ve expected to now be hazy in his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cbecause you seem like such a sweet and lovely girl,\u201d jungkook had said softly, bringing a timid smile to her face, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m jisu,\u201d she answered, looking slightly less intimidated. \u201cy-you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m jungkook, and this,\u201d jungkook gestured towards jimin, displaying his bunny teeth, \u201cis jimin.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s really nice to meet you, jisu. what are you colouring?\u201d jimin had asked her, now properly taking a seat in front of her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>and then the three of them had begun to talk. they had talked for a whole\u00a0<em>forty-seven minutes\u00a0</em>before the owner of the orphanage had interrupted them. during these forty-seven minutes, jimin and jungkook had learned that jisu absolutely\u00a0<em>loved</em>\u00a0drawing and colouring and that her favourite colour was yellow. they had also learned that she didn\u2019t get along with the other children in the orphanage too well since they were all rowdy and loud, leaving her feeling intimidated, causing her to just want to stay with herself for most of the day except for when they were forced to play group games or when they had movie nights at the orphanage. lastly, they learned that the two friends she owned were recently taken into new homes. she had cried a lot at their departure, but was happy for them and their new family. when jimin had asked her if she wanted to be taken into a new home, she had softly nodded, saying that she really wanted a family just like her friends now had, since her friends had both only recently talked to her through the orphanage\u2019s phone, telling her how amazing it was to have a mother and a father. it was at that exact moment when jungkook and jimin had given each other a swift glance, both of their eyes glossy, overwhelmed by their emotions towards jisu. they were ready to do <em>anything</em>, as parents, to see jisu smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>when their conversation had been interrupted by the orphanage\u2019s owner, jungkook had stroked jisu\u2019s cheek and told her that they\u2019d be back in a few minutes. the owner of the orphanage, who had introduced herself as yuna, had taken jungkook and jimin back to the waiting room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci see you\u2019ve found your daughter,\u201d yuna had beamed at them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwe...<em>have</em>,\u201d jimin had said, bubbling with excitement, causing jungkook to look at him in complete admiration, \u201cwe...<em>love</em>\u00a0jisu. she\u2019s just so <em>cute</em>! we can\u2019t wait to get to know her better and spend time with her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cjisu is a shy girl. she even took a long time to make friends here, at the orphanage,\u201d yuna had said and continued calmly, \u201cshe was almost taken in by another family a few months ago. they had come to meet her, just like you both, but all jisu did was cry at their sight. i-i have such a soft spot for her, i just couldn\u2019t see her being taken away by that couple. they seemed like genuinely good people, but the way she was crying, i-i just had to tell pair them up with another child. i...i was so surprised that she actually <em>talked</em> so much with you both today.\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin smiled at yuna and jungkook intertwined his fingers with jimin\u2019s, his thumb caressing jimin\u2019s hand soothingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s when i noticed the kind of\u00a0<em>love</em>\u00a0you both were looking at her and talking to her with. no wonder she wasn\u2019t afraid. i\u2019ve never seen a couple looking at a child with so much of love right at the first meeting...as if she really was born from your own blood,\u201d yuna said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook had given jimin\u2019s hand a squeeze, delight bubbling through every inch of him at yuna\u2019s words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwe...,\u201d jungkook started, \u201cwould really love to adopt jisu. we don\u2019t even need to discuss it or think about it further. we\u2019d love it if the adoption procedure could be wrapped up.\u201d</p>\n<p>yuna had given them a satisfied nod, taking them towards a whole file of papers which were to be signed in order to complete the procedure which had been going on since weeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d yuna had warned them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin and jungkook\u2019s gaze had met and their eyes were glinting with anticipation, \u201cwe don\u2019t mind at all; it\u2019s going to be worth it,\u201d jimin had voiced out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>and it was, without question, worth it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin played with jisu\u2019s silky hair as they stood in the queue to buy their amusement park tickets. he gripped into her tightly, wanting to hold her securely in his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhen\u2019s appa coming back?\u201d jisu asked jimin, poking her fingers into jimin\u2019s cheeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked around, in hope of spotting his husband who\u2019d left for a quick trip to the washroom a few minutes ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cthere\u2019s probably a long queue to use the washroom too, since it\u2019s really crowded today,\u201d jimin told jisu, \u201ci\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll take another five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdo you want to put me down? i can stand on my own, appa, i\u2019m not tired,\u201d jisu smiled at jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201caw, my love, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not heavy. also, don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d jimin bumped his nose with hers, \u201cif you aren\u2019t tired then why\u2019d you tell kookie to pick you up when he was here?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu grinned, \u201cbecause he offered! he <em>always</em> offers! he loves carrying me around!\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin laughed, \u201cthat\u2019s true, he does love carrying you around. sometimes i feel as if he forgets that you have legs. but baby, even i love carrying you around<em>,\u00a0</em>so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbut your arms start hurting faster. i don\u2019t like to see you in pain, appa.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmy arms do\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0start hurting faster,\u201d jimin defensively squealed. \u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu giggled and began to poke jimin\u2019s shoulder playfully, easily distracting herself from the waiting. jimin gave her a loving smile and knew that she was right; jungkook\u00a0<em>did</em>, in fact, lift jisu up very easily. jungkook even loved carrying jimin around the house whenever jimin was even slightly tired or just simply lazy. he <em>really</em> enjoyed putting his strong arms to use. and jimin loved it. it had been\u00a0<em>years</em>, but jimin still found his husband\u2019s muscles and strength to be <em>such</em> a turn on. and jungkook knew it, he knew it so well, causing him to devotedly work out every single morning, without fail, for an hour before work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin finally let jisu down so that she could stand on her own, since a slight pain had taken over his arms. she excitedly looked at the ticket counter and tugged on jimin\u2019s arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s almost our turn!\u201d she said and began to hop around like a bunny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin giggled and placed his hand on his hyperactive daughter\u2019s shoulder, trying to calm her down a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m feeling a bit thirsty,\u201d jisu said, halting her movements after a hopping for minutes. \u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin quickly reached into his bag and took out a plastic water bottle which he was glad he had remembered to fill and carry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chere,\u201d jimin said while handing her the bottle, earning a smile from her as she tried to open it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin laughed at the way she was struggling to open it, and he extended his arm towards her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cgive it to me, i\u2019ll open it,\u201d he managed to say in the middle of his laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cno,\u00a0<em>i</em>\u00a0want to do it,\u201d jisu whined, using all her strength and concentration to open the bottle, her lips forming a pout, resembling a small beak.</p>\n<p>jimin doubled over with laughter by her side, ignoring the glances from all the parents with their children around him. he quickly took his phone out, wanting to record the adorable sight for jungkook to see.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked down at the pocket of his jeans and fumbled with pulling his phone out. his ears were met with a loud sound, causing him to immediately look towards his daughter, wanting to make sure that she was okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s worried eyes were met with jisu\u2019s shocked face, the water bottle nowhere to be seen. jimin frowned, confused. he looked to his left, seeing the water bottle on the ground, next to the back side of another man\u2019s shoes. his eyes went wide as he realised what had happened. the water bottle had flown from her hands right into the back of the man standing in front of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ca-appa, i\u2019m sorry, it was a mistake,\u201d jisu whispered to jimin, her eyes laced with panic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin immediately pulled her towards himself and stroked her cheek, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, my darling, i know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes landed on the man, who\u2019s back was still facing them. the man began to turn around, and jimin\u2019s heart sped up with guilt. he knew the bottle wouldn\u2019t have hit him hard enough to actually injure him, but\u00a0<em>still</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m so sorry, sir,\u201d jimin said, anxiety evident in his voice, \u201cmy daughter was trying to open the bottle and it just slipped from her hand. it was a mistake, we\u2019re so sorry. a-are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>the man had broad shoulders and a large frame, but was only slightly taller than jimin. the man turned around, agonizingly slowly, as if too angry to move fast. \u00a0</p>\n<p>the man was now facing him, annoyance evident in his expression. he seemed to be in his early thirties, jimin noticed. he wasn\u2019t accompanied by anybody; his wife and children clearly waiting somewhere else while he was buying them tickets. or maybe he was visiting the park alone. but he didn\u2019t seem like the kind of person who\u2019d visit amusement parks alone, without somebody dragging him to do so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>who</em>\u00a0did that?\u201d he said, his angry eyes directed towards jisu, being his prime suspect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cit was a mistake,\u201d jimin said, keeping his voice calm.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou don\u2019t even know how to control your daughter, do you?\u201d he said, voice sharp, now looking down at jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin protectively pulled jisu behind himself and kept his arm on her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m sorry, sir, it really was a mistake. a-are you hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cgoddammit,\u00a0<em>no</em>, do you think i\u2019m made of glass? but i\u2019ve been standing in this queue for forty-five fucking minutes,\u201d he said, and jimin flinched at the use of the\u00a0<em>f-word</em>\u00a0in front of jisu, \u201cso the least you can do is not throw a bottle on my back.\u201d</p>\n<p>jimin knew jisu and him didn\u2019t deserve a screaming at such an innocent mistake, but he just wanted to get the argument over with, knowing that jisu was scared. jimin gripped onto jisu even more tightly, in an attempt assure her that he wouldn\u2019t let <em>anything</em> happen to her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m really sorry sir, i-i don\u2019t know what i can do to help but if there\u2019s anything i-\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>the man cut jimin off as he stepped closer, making jimin feel\u00a0<em>small,\u00a0</em>but the second jimin felt jisu trembling behind him, jimin was filled up with <em>all</em> the courage in the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201csir, you\u2019re scaring my daughter,\u00a0<em>stop it.</em>\u00a0i said it was a mistake, and neither are you injured, so please let it go now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>rage flashed in the man\u2019s eyes.\u00a0<em>wrong move, wrong move, wrong move.\u00a0</em>jimin felt a few people now watching them, but no one dared to say anything. jimin gulped.<br>\n<br>\nthe man barked, \u201cmind my own business? when\u00a0<em>you\u2019re</em>\u00a0the one who couldn\u2019t mind your own business? are you saying i\u2019m wrong to have raised my voice? when i\u2019m the victim here who\u2019s been hurt by the bottle\u2013\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cb-but you said you didn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d jisu\u2019s soft voice spoke from behind.\u00a0<em>oh god jisu</em>, jimin thought to himself and squeezed her shoulder, i<em>\u00a0guess we both have no sense of what and what not to say in front of somebody ridiculously angry</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat...did...you...just say to me?\u201d the man said, his voice rising. he tried to come closer to jisu but jimin blocked his way, stepping in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cstay away from her. she\u2019s a child, let her be. please, your turn to buy the ticket is coming in just a second. j-just focus on that,\u201d jimin said, faking confidence, but his voice faltering by the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyou piece of <em>shit</em>,\u201d the man said, balling his fists together, now only an inch away from jimin. jimin scrunched his eyes shut as the man continued speaking while being uncomfortably close to his face, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what i-\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat the\u00a0<em>hell</em>\u00a0do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d a loud voice boomed.\u00a0<em>jungkook</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin opened his eyes only to see jungkook having pushed the man away from jimin, jungkook\u2019s hands still on the angry man\u2019s shoulders, keeping him in place, away from jisu and jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>appa</em>!\u201d jisu squealed from behind, now coming to jimin\u2019s side instead of hiding behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s neck snapped towards his daughter at the sound of her voice. jimin and jisu\u2019s hands were tightly intertwined with each other.\u00a0<em>my babies</em>, jungkook thought to himself,\u00a0how <em>dare</em> this man scare them?<em>\u00a0</em>jungkook felt fury bubble inside of himself; he wanted to <em>punch</em> the man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the man put his hands on jungkook\u2019s arms, trying to get jungkook to leave his shoulders. but jungkook didn\u2019t budge. he was stronger,\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0stronger, than the man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m not going to let go until you apologise. who gave you the right to get so aggressive with my husband and my child?\u201d jungkook spoke, his voice loud and cold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyour daughter\u2019s water bottle hit my back! and your\u00a0<em>husband</em>,\u201d he said, disgust lacing his voice at the last word, \u201cis such a <em>brat</em>, he-\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook pushed the man, letting go of his shoulders and making the man stumble back a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t you\u00a0<em>dare</em>,\u201d jungkook growled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook turned back and looked at the two loves of his life. seeing both of their brows furrowed in worry made his heart ache. jimin mouthed to him to stop, to walk away, but jungkook didn\u2019t want to. he <em>couldn\u2019t</em> let this man just have his way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cdo me a favour, my loves,\u201d jungkook said to jimin and jisu, his voice soft, \u201ci\u2019ll have a talk with this man while you both wait for me at the entrance of the park, okay? i\u2019ll buy the tickets and come there. just wait for me, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin obediently nodded, knowing that jungkook was too angry listen to him even if he tried to protest. jimin knew jungkook wouldn\u2019t get into a fist fight, knowing that there are families with children around him, but he probably would give the man an angry earful, making sure that the man wouldn\u2019t bother anybody else in this manner in the future.\u00a0 jimin took jisu into his arms and walked away from the scene, trying to block out the faint sound of the argument going on behind them as they walked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t worry baby, appa will be with us in just a few minutes, okay? that man treated us both badly, appa is just making sure that he doesn\u2019t do the same with anybody else,\u201d jimin assured her, giving her a faint smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cb-but that man won\u2019t h-hurt appa right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cno baby, appa is much stronger, nothing will happen to him. also, appa isn\u2019t going to hit the man or anything. violence is never the answer and appa knows that. he\u2019s just going to calm the man down and talk to him, okay? he\u2019ll be back really fast. let\u2019s wait for him at the entrance of the park.\u201d</p>\n<p>and just as jimin had said, jungkook was there with the tickets in a matter of ten minutes. jungkook jogged towards his husband and daughter, giving them a reassuring smile while cheerfully waving the tickets at them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook gave jimin a kiss on the cheek and immediately took jisu from his arms, not wanting his husband to bear her weight. he held jisu with his right arm and he pulled jimin in for a hug with his left. jisu and jimin both nuzzled into his neck. he had his entire world right <em>here</em> in his arms. he felt warmth spread through his chest. one after the other, jungkook left sloppy kisses on both of their cheeks</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re both okay?\u201d he whispered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes baby, don\u2019t worry,\u201d jimin smiled at jungkook, easing his worry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cappa said we can do the spinning cups ride first!\u201d jisu exclaimed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook laughed and caressed her cheek, \u201cwell, if that\u2019s what appa said, and if that\u2019s what you want, then that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do! let\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>and they walked into the park, hand in hand, laughter taking over the three of them, completely forgetting about the events which had occurred a while back. they were simply happy to be with each other; that\u2019s all that mattered to them, <em>each other.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u2661</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cand that\u2019s when we noticed that there was a cat in the bush,\u201d jisu continued her story of the encounter her and her friend had with a kitten in school on that day.</p>\n<p>jimin smiled at her fondly as she went on and on about the kitten and\u00a0<em>cute</em>\u00a0it was. he gave her occasional nods and smiles, encouraging her to speak more.\u00a0jimin glanced at his watch,\u00a0<em>5pm</em>; jungkook would be home from work any second. jimin\u2019s body tingled with excitement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu\u2019s talking was interrupted by the sound of jingling keys outside their apartment\u2019s main door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ckookie\u2019s home,\u201d jimin smiled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu immediately put her small hands on jimin\u2019s mouth, shutting him up, \u201clet\u2019s hide somewhere! let\u2019s not make any sound and let\u2019s hide somewhere!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin giggled at her mischievous smile and nodded, letting himself get pulled by her. she tugged on his arm and dragged him to hide in the small space behind their couch. jimin sat on the floor with his legs crossed, sandwiched between the wall and the back of their couch. jisu placed herself in jimin\u2019s lap, bubbling with excitement, \u201cappa won\u2019t be able to find us here!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin wrapped his arms around her and nuzzled his face into her neck from the behind. they could hear the sound of their apartment\u2019s door opening and then shutting. the footsteps, which were previously loud and clear, were now soft, indicating that jungkook had taken his shoes off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m home!\u201d jungkook announced.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu began to giggle and jimin had to place his hands on her mouth to shut her up, \u201c<em>shhhh</em>!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin and jisu couldn\u2019t see jungkook from where they were sitting, but they knew jungkook was close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>oh</em>, what\u2019s that sound?\u201d jungkook said, speaking loudly on purpose, clearly having heard his daughter\u2019s giggle\u00a0</p>\n<p>jisu began to giggle even harder, jimin\u2019s hands on her mouth having absolutely no effect any longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci wonder where my pretty little daughter is,\u201d jungkook voiced out, faking confusion, knowing that they were hiding, \u201cand i wonder where my pretty little husband is.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin smiled, knowing that jungkook was taking rounds of their living room, trying to excite jisu, despite him knowing exactly where they were.\u00a0</p>\n<p>they heard the footsteps getting louder towards their right, and jisu whispered into jimin\u2019s ear with urgency, \u201cwe should try to run out from the other side! we\u2019ll run towards the kitchen, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin nodded, ready to sprint. but just as they began to move away from their hiding spot, a strong arm gripped them both. before jimin knew what was happening, he felt himself being thrown onto jungkook\u2019s shoulder, while jisu had been thrown onto jungkook\u2019s other shoulder. jungkook held them tightly and ran with them towards the bedroom. jisu couldn\u2019t stop squealing and laughing, trying to wriggle her way out of his grip, and neither could jimin control his laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cmy naughty little babies,\u201d jungkook growled and gently placed them on the bed, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin and jisu both looked at each other and giggled. jimin always felt like such a\u00a0<em>child</em>\u00a0when he was with his daughter, always laughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin looked at jungkook, only to find that jungkook was already staring at him, his gaze being both, soft and hungry at the same time. jimin felt a shiver creep up his spine. jungkook\u2019s gaze still had\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0kind of an effect on him. jungkook was wearing his work attire; a white shirt with black pants and tie. and jimin just found it so\u00a0<em>hot</em>. jimin gulped and stared right into jungkook\u2019s eyes, wanting to pull him closer by tugging on his tie and bringing him down.\u00a0<em>control yourself, jisu is right here,</em>\u00a0jimin told himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>the doorbell rang and jisu immediately sprang off the bed, \u201cit must be mijin! if it\u2019s her, i\u2019ll leave to go down to play from there only, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes,\u201d jungkook said, breaking his eye contact with jimin. his expression had changed completely from the one he had while he was looking at jimin just a second ago. jungkook gave jisu a warm smile, \u201cbe back in an hour, okay? and make sure to take a water bottle with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201caye aye captain,\u201d she laughed and ran out of the room while screaming out an excited\u00a0<em>bye</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook now loomed over jimin\u2019s body, caging jimin to the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ch-hi,\u201d jimin said, a smile playing on his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chey baby,\u201d jungkook said, his voice low and hoarse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>in the background, they heard jisu and mijin talking and laughing together. jungkook and jimin silently waited to hear the sound of their apartment\u2019s door shutting. the second jungkook heard the click of the door, he dove in to smash his lips against his husband\u2019s plump red ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>their tongues explored each other\u2019s\u2019 mouths and they pulled away, after a whole minute of kissing, breathless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201chow was your day?\u201d jungkook asked, before diving down to leave soft kisses across jimin\u2019s jawline and neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cm-my day...,\u201d jimin started, feeling\u00a0too\u00a0aroused to speak coherently, \u201cwas g-good.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled away, halting his kisses so that jimin could continue. he genuinely wanted to know how jimin\u2019s day was. he wanted to know every little thing jimin and jisu did through the day. he loved them, he loved them so\u00a0<em>much</em>, it almost pained his heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin continued to tell jungkook about his day, after which jungkook told jimin about his own day, placing kisses on jimin\u2019s lips and nose occasionally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin giggled at the kiss jungkook left on his nose. jimin used jungkook\u2019s tie to pull him down and crash their lips together again. jimin bit on jungkook\u2019s lower lip, earning a low grunt from jungkook.\u00a0jungkook was completely pressed against jimin, and jimin could feel jungkook growing harder by the second. jungkook his crotch down against jimin\u2019s, causing jimin to moan into their kiss, himself being hard now.</p>\n<p>\u201cf-fuck,\u201d jimin mewled, in the middle of their kiss. \u201ck-kookie, fuck me. fuck me right\u00a0<em>now</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook obediently nodded, and in a matter of a few minutes, the only sounds which could be heard were of jimin\u2019s and jungkook\u2019s low moans, with an occasional,\u00a0\u201c<em>f-faster</em>, kookie,<em>\u201d</em>\u00a0or a \u201cbaby, you take my cock so <em>well</em>, make me feel so <em>good</em>. you\u2019re doing amazing, my kitten, letting me fill you up entirely.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u2661</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin engulfed jungkook with a back hug as jungkook chopped some vegetables in the kitchen, \u201cbaby, are you sure we\u2019re discrete enough? jisu doesn\u2019t come to know, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci think you need to work on your\u00a0<em>limp</em>, baby,\u201d jungkook smirked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin shook his head and blushed, \u201cn-no, i never limp, w-why would i limp in front of her...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbecause i fuck your little hole so good and you can\u2019t control your limp after that?\u201d jungkook said, letting out a smug laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cshe\u2019s right there in the living room! don\u2019t say things like that, what if she hears?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cbaby, i\u2019m pretty sure me fucking you senseless isn\u2019t what\u2019ll come to her mind when she sees you limp, so don\u2019t worry. but...,\u201d jungkook turned around, facing jimin now, placing his finger on jimin\u2019s neck, \u201cthese bite marks are something i\u2019ll have to work on.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cthey\u2019re <em>visible</em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyes,\u201d jungkook smirked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201coh my <em>god</em>,\u201d jimin buried his face in his hands, \u201chow are you so\u00a0<em>casual</em>\u00a0about this? i thought the marks you\u2019d leave would get covered by my tee shirt!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cyou pulling up your tee shirt\u2019s neck line to cover them whenever you\u2019re in front of a mirror doesn\u2019t mean the tee shirt will\u00a0<em>stay</em>\u00a0up like that all day,\u201d jungkook laughed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m so\u00a0<em>embarrassed</em>,\u201d jimin said, nuzzling his face into jungkook\u2019s neck, wanting to hide in shame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook gave jimin\u2019s waist a squeeze, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, baby, i bet she doesn\u2019t actually notice any of it. or she probably thinks we fell down or something? that\u2019s what we told her once, remember? a long time back, when she asked about your bruise?\u201d</p>\n<p>jisu was currently sat in the living room, busy reading her book. her mind wandered to how jimin was limping in the kitchen when she entered the house after having returned from the playground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cthey\u2019re so clumsy,\u201d she muttered to herself affectionately, \u201ci leave for the park and suddenly they start falling all over the place and bumping into the tables. i mean, i come back to jiminie appa limping and both of them having bruises so often\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat is she muttering to herself?\u201d jimin whispered to jungkook, while they were both standing behind the couch, watching their daughter affectionately without her knowing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cshe\u2019s probably talking to <em>jin</em>,\u201d jungkook laughed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin\u2019s cheeks flushed as he giggled, \u201cjungkook, don\u2019t bring <em>that</em> up!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cbaby, i can\u2019t believe you told her that there\u2019s a friendly ghost named jin who only comes alive when she uses the colour pink while drawing, i mean-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cshhh!\u201d jimin laughed, covering jungkook\u2019s mouth with his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulled jimin\u2019s hands away from his mouth and leaned in to kiss jimin, smiling tenderly, \u201ci think it\u2019s cute, okay? it\u2019s cute that you had an imaginary friend named jin. and it\u2019s cute that you told her about him too, and it\u2019s even <em>cuter</em> that she believed you and didn\u2019t even find it silly. <em>both</em> of you are the cutest!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>jimin smiled, loving the way jungkook was looking at him as if he was his entire universe. because jungkook surely was his entire universe. and so was jisu. his reason to <em>breathe</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cmy heart beats for you both,\u201d jungkook whispered, pulling jimin into his chest while wrapping his arms around jimin\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cand so does mine.\u201d\u00a0</p>"
