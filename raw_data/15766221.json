  "notes": "<p>This story was inspired by Neil Gaiman\u2019s response to the question: What is the best way to seduce a writer?</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my experience, writers tend to be really good at the inside of their own heads and imaginary people, and a lot less good at the stuff going on outside, which means that quite often if you flirt with us we will completely fail to notice, leaving everybody involved slightly uncomfortable and more than slightly unlaid.</p>\n<p>So I would suggest that any attempted seduction of a writer would probably go a great deal easier for all parties if you sent them a cheerful note saying \u201cYOU ARE INVITED TO A SEDUCTION: Please come to dinner on Friday Night. Wear the kind of clothes you would like to be seduced in.\u201d</p>\n<p>And alcohol may help, too. Or kissing. Many writers figure out that they\u2019re being seduced or flirted with if someone is actually kissing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Massive beta help from Jamethiel who patiently read and reread this monstrous one-shot and nudged me firmly in the right direction whenever I went astray.</p>\n<p>This version of the story is E rated, there is a revised, M rated version on my FFN account under the same penname.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/38cd4cef304aa9bfa23a39fcad497b81/tumblr_pdtytkXpH81qfei2p_540.jpg\" alt width=\"100%\">\n</p>\n<p>Draco stared, mesmerized, as a barefoot Hermione Granger stepped toward him, closed her fingers lightly around his wrist, and drew his hand toward her face. Then she parted her lips\u2014just enough to slip her pink tongue out\u2014and slid the tip of it slowly and firmly over the end of his little finger.</p>\n<p>If the visual weren\u2019t enough, the sensation immediately succeeded in sending almost all of his blood in a southward direction.</p>\n<p>Then her tongue vanished back inside her mouth and she stared up at the ceiling looking thoughtful for several seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it needs a dash of vanilla extract,\u201d she finally said in a matter-of-fact tone, letting go of his hand and turning away from him.</p>\n<p>As she turned away Draco felt his heart, which had momentarily been leaping, drop sharply and proceed to journey considerably further south than his blood had. He watched her walk over and scramble up onto the kitchen counter as she scrounged through one of his cabinets.</p>\n<p>\u201cFound it,\u201d she sang out a moment later and waved a small vial over her head as she tried to climb down from the counter without falling.</p>\n<p>Draco put the whisk he was holding back into the bowl of whipped cream on the counter and stepped over. He wrapped his hands around her waist as she slid down to the floor and left them there as she turned and stared up at him, her eyes dancing.</p>\n<p>Their bodies were almost touching. If he dipped his head he could have kissed her; picked her up and put her back on the counter while he wrapped her legs around his waist and his tongue explored her mouth and his hands caressed her curves.</p>\n<p>But as he stared down at her there was no \u2018moment\u2019 that suddenly passed between them. Her eyes didn\u2019t darken as they looked up at his; her face showed no awareness of the intimacy between them. Instead she was waving a glass vial in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour kitchen organization is atrocious,\u201d she said. \u201cWho on earth keeps their vanilla extract with their herbs and spices? I found it next to your chili flakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>She poked him in the ribs and slipped around him in order to scurry back to the bowl of whipped cream. With a flick of her wrist she added a dash of vanilla and then whipped it several more times before sticking her own finger into the soft, half developed peaks and then sliding it into her mouth and sucking on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter, I think.\u201d She dipped another finger into the whipped cream and held it toward Draco.</p>\n<p>He stepped forward and wrapped his hand around her wrist and raised her fingers up toward his lips, meeting her eyes as he proceeded to encase her entire finger inside his mouth and slowly suck the whipped cream off.</p>\n<p>She gave a musical peal of laughter and pulled her hand away from him with a snort.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Trying to seduce me, Draco Malfoy?\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed again and shook her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re absurd,\u201d she said, tossing the words over her shoulder as she turned and walked to the stove where a cauldron of soup was simmering.</p>\n<p>Draco stared at her wistfully and felt whatever remained of his heart tug painfully in his chest as he watched her.</p>\n<p>Her hair was messily piled atop her head with dozens of escaped locks falling over her face and curling around her ears and wisping along her neck. She was dressed in a simple sheath dress, her robes laid aside. Around her waist was tied a suspiciously feminine apron, considering that she was currently cooking in the kitchen of an established bachelor. Her shoes had been kicked off the moment she\u2019d come through the floo and left in a corner.</p>\n<p>She removed the lid from the cauldron and flicked a generous sprinkling of salt across the surface. Then she stirred the contents a few times before turning back toward Draco cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere. Now we just let it simmer for another fifteen minutes and the potatoes should be perfect. What were we saying before you asked me to taste the whipped cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hopped up onto the edge of the counter and her feet dangled against the cabinet as she picked up her wine glass from where she\u2019d left it and cradled the bowl in her hands as she started speaking animatedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh right. Alchemy.\u201d Her expression brightened further. \u201cAre we really expected to believe that Nicholas Flamel was the only person to successfully create a Philosopher\u2019s Stone in five hundred years? Even granting that most Wizarding folk dislike the alchemical branch of magical lore, it seems highly implausible that no one else has even managed to do it even after it was demonstrated to be possible to create one. I mean, we\u2019re talking about eternal life. Everyone is obsessed with that. But somehow no one else has ever succeeded in making a philosopher\u2019s stone? I don\u2019t buy it. There clearly must be some kind of censorship by the ministry or even the ICW.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared at her in silence for several seconds before he swallowed hard and forced himself to open his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to keep doing this, Hermione?\u201d he finally asked in a low voice.</p>\n<p>Her eyebrows furrowed and then arched.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s shoulders slumped and he give a tired sigh. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, gesturing between them and then generally around his kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe book club?\u201d Hermione said looking baffled. \u201cDinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco felt tempted to shake her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d he bit out, feeling annoyed the she was forcing him to spell it all out. \u201cYou are clearly and abundantly not interested, so is there a reason we\u2019re still doing this after two years?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looked at him, wide-eyed and bewildered. Her cheerfulness had vanished and her eyes were so large he could practically see himself in the reflection.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to stop?\u201d she said, her expression growing visibly hurt. \u201cWhy? How can you say I\u2019m not interested? I\u2019ve never missed a single book. I know I get here late sometimes\u2014because of work, but that\u2014that\u2019s never intentional. I\u2019ve always owled to let you know. I can stop bringing take-out on the nights I\u2019m supposed to shop. I know I\u2019ve done that a lot lately. But that wasn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m sorry. You should have said something. I didn\u2019t realize it bothered you. I\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Draco stared at her dazedly.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s lower lip trembled faintly and her eyes got shiny and she abruptly coughed and then cleared her throat and stopped talking.</p>\n<p>Draco felt his jaw fall somewhat slack.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d he said and buried his face in his hands for several seconds while he tried to absorb the realization he had just had.</p>\n<p>When he looked up at Hermione, he found her staring at him with an expression of extreme hurt and a glimmer of anger in her eyes. He stared down at the floor and opened and closed his mouth repeatedly as he tried to figure out where to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d he said at last, using a slow, even voice as he looked across the kitchen at her, \u201chas it never struck you as odd that we are the only two participants in our book club?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione blinked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the topics we like to read about are rather diverse and obscure. It would be surprising to find someone else who was interested in all the same things we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWere you wanting to expand it? We\u2014can. I suppose the discussions probably aren\u2019t as comprehensive since it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed and tried again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have dinner. Specifically, we have dinner here in my townhouse, which we normally cook together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if we ate separately before meeting up we\u2019d have less time to talk about the book we read,\u201d Hermione said slowly as though it were obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Draco said, clenching his hand into a fist in order to keep from burying his face in it again. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I said when I first suggested dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Hermione said in a sharp tone. Her expression was still visibly hurt and defensive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe drink wine and eat and discuss the book and talk about anything else that comes to mind until late into the night and you regularly stay over and sleep in my guest bedroom,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe regularly go on trips to vineyards or to visit museums or new bookstores together on the weekends,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>The bewilderment in Hermione\u2019s expression suddenly faded and became replaced by a look both pensive and regretful. Her mouth quivered faintly before she spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh... I understand. I\u2019m encroaching aren\u2019t I? Of course, I\u2019m stealing all your spare time. You must have other people you\u2019d rather spend your weekends with. It probably gives the wrong impression that you have me spending the night here. You should have said something sooner. Ron\u2019s been saying I\u2019m practically dating you. I understand. Do you\u2014,\u201d her expression grew wistful. \u201cWould you be willing to just scale back? We could meet at a coffee shop like we did in the beginning. Just half an hour. Or did you just want to\u2014want to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco clamped his hands over his mouth as he stared at Hermione Granger, the brightest witch her age, and tried to formulate a reply.</p>\n<p>Finally he dropped his hands and gripped the edge of counter instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d he said in a strained voice, \u201dplease don\u2019t take offense by how blunt I\u2019m about to be, but I\u2019m honestly afraid that if I explain this with any type of subtlety it will somehow continue to elude you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s expression grew indignant but Draco ignored it and pressed on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am trying to seduce you,\u201d he said, staring her straight in the eye. Her indignation faded as her mouth dropped open and her eyes slowly grew round.</p>\n<p>He continued, \u201cI have been trying to seduce you for over two years; ever since I first brought up the idea of our having a book club together.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestured around the room. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI moved out of my manor and bought a townhouse just so I could invite you over and cook for you in place you wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable in; because I was trying to seduce you. I\u2019ve plied you with wine and chocolate and you have your own toothbrush and drawer of clothes in my house because I\u2019ve been trying to seduce you. I have taken you to vineyards and museums and the bookstores and libraries because I have been trying to seduce you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ran a hand through his hair and slumped against the counter slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that you just needed time. I thought if I was patient that eventually you\u2019d get to know me and realize that I wasn\u2019t the person I was in school; that if I waited you\u2019d eventually come to trust me enough to know I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you. I\u2014thought that <em> that </em> was what the last two years had been about. And that was fine. I\u2019ll wait a decade or a century if that\u2019s what it takes. But\u2014it didn\u2019t even occur to me that you hadn\u2019t realized that I have been trying to seduce you this entire time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He needed a stiff drink. Several. An entire bar would probably be ideal. More than a bar. Perhaps he\u2019d buy a whisky distillery.</p>\n<p>Granger\u2019s eyes were so enormous as she stared at him that she looked like a muggle cartoon animal.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014what?\u201d she finally choked out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have been trying to seduce you,\u201d Draco said again in a flat, resigned voice and wondered if he should write it on a board or perhaps print it into a book for her. He\u2019d already said it a half dozen times and if she continued to not understand he would probably feel obliged to jump off a bridge somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know that?\u201d she said in a shrill tone.</p>\n<p>He stared at her, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you think was going on?\u201d he said in bafflement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said in wobbling voice, setting her wine glass down and fluttering her hands around in a way that she tended to when she was at a loss for words. \u201cNormally\u2014boys just tell me I\u2019m pretty and then try to kiss me, or they ask me to accompany them to balls and ministry events. They don\u2019t start book clubs and buy townhouses and invite me to cook dinner with them and set up spare bedrooms.\u201d She gestured up toward the ceiling but then her hands abruptly shot down and she gripped the edge of the counter, looking as though she were on the verge of toppling off of it. \u201cDid you expect me to assume I was special? For all I know you do the same things with all your friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Were his hands shaking? Yes. It appeared that they were shaking from frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Hermione, on Thursday nights I have Blaise over for my other book club and we cook dinner and waltz together in my kitchen and then drink wine and I hand feed him chocolates too,\u201d Draco said in a voice that dripped sarcasm. \u201cAnd then, when I\u2019m not spending my weekends with you, I instead take Pansy to vineyards and we go horseback riding together at sunset.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione turned bright red.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not good at noticing things like that,\u201d she finally said in a very small voice. \u201cFlirting. I always miss the cues when it comes to flirting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve realized that now,\u201d Draco said, thinking back upon how pointedly he had always refrained from ever actually stating any level of interest because he\u2019d feared it would be too much and might pressure her. He\u2019d assumed that she would be assuming his interest; that it had been established; an implicit understanding between them. That at some point, if he were patient enough, she\u2019d be willing to initiate some type of physical reciprocity and then he could go from there, confident that she was comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>But she hadn\u2019t even realized...</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, just to be clear. Since tonight is all about finally being clear. I\u2019m assuming that since it never so much as crossed your mind that I was trying to seduce you, that means that you are not interested,\u201d he said in a wooden voice and as he started a mental checklist: One, get drunk. Two, stay drunk. Three, sell the townhouse. Four, move to Africa. Five, stay in Africa.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014interested.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinked and stared at her in astonishment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still wrapping my mind around all this,\u201d she said, blushing and fidgeting with her apron hem, \u201cbut I\u2019m\u2014interested. If you\u2014if you\u2019re still interested. I\u2019d like to try again, now that I know what\u2019s going on. Maybe not tonight. I think I\u2019m going into shock currently. But maybe next week, we could\u2014try and see. Now that I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared at her dazedly and she gave him a small, nervous smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext week?\u201d he repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that\u2014does that work for you? To\u2014to seduce me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded slowly. \u201cI can make room for it. Definitely. Same time? I\u2019ll cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Hermione said bobbing her head. Her cheeks were still stained scarlet. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d Her eyes widened with embarrassment. \u201cI mean\u2014I mean, I\u2019ll see you then. I should\u2014I think I need to\u2014to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>She jumped off the counter and bolted from the kitchen and he heard the roar of the floo a minute later.</p>\n<p>He stood in his kitchen for several more minutes as he tried to absorb the fact that he had spent the last two years of his life trying to seduce Hermione Granger and somehow she hadn\u2019t noticed it.</p>\n<p>Two days later Hermione received a large envelope in the post. The heavy card stock was champagne colored with silver calligraphy scripted across it, smooth under her fingers as she slit it open with a letter opener. As soon as the envelope was opened there was an explosion of fairy dust that filled the air around her with sparkling, glimmering light. A small golden orb floated up from the envelope and began forming large, glowing letters that hung in mid air.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> YOU ARE INVITED TO A SEDUCTION </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> Please come to dinner on Friday night. Wear the kind of clothes you would like to be seduced in. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hermione did not floo into Draco\u2019s townhouse from the ministry as was her usual custom the following Friday night. Instead, at 5:30 sharp, there was a tentative knock on his front door.</p>\n<p>He swung the door open and there she was.</p>\n<p>She appeared to have gone home and changed from her work clothes.</p>\n<p>Her hair was much more orderly looking than usual, like she\u2019d put a potion into it to try to contain the curls. Her eyes were darker with mascara and she had applied lipstick and blush in matching shades of rose pink. She had removed the pearl stud earrings she always wore and had replaced them with small, dangling silver earrings that trembled faintly as she stared up at him. She was enveloped in a long black cloak.</p>\n<p>He opened the door wider to invite her in.</p>\n<p>She scurried into the foyer and then turned and stared awkwardly at him. He held out his hand to take her cloak.</p>\n<p>She flushed faintly as she reached up to unclasp it and pulled it off quickly.</p>\n<p>She was dressed in something that looked almost liquid as it hung about her curves. It was most definitely muggle. It was sleeveless with very narrow straps and he got the distinct impression that it was the sort of clothing that if he were to slip the straps off her shoulders that the entire thing might slide off of her and pool at her feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said in a slightly shrill voice, \u201chere I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood and stared, looking at her up and down and wondering if he were hallucinating or if Hermione Granger really had arrived at his house wearing nothing but a very, very easily removed piece of clothing after he had sent her an explicit invitation to come over and be seduced by him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d rather expected her to arrive even more buttoned up that usual, with her hair pulled severely back and sensible tights and one of those annoying sheath dresses with very small and barely helpful side-zipper that was utterly impossible to get off dexterously.</p>\n<p>The sensuous vision currently fidgeting nervously in his foyer was like the fantasy of a two year younger and far more optimistic version of himself.</p>\n<p>He swallowed hard.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t need to eat dinner, did they? They could just skip the cooking and the eating and the conversations and go straight to letting him find out how her dress was staying on.</p>\n<p>Two interminable years of foreplay was surely enough.</p>\n<p>Except that it had apparently been entirely one-sided.</p>\n<p>He sighed internally and forced himself to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m making paninis,\u201d he said, \u201cand a salad with candied walnuts. Would you mind making the dressing? Your champagne vinaigrette always turns out better than mine and I cannot account for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hermione said in a stiff, formal voice. \u201cWhat kind of paninis are you making?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d Draco admitted. \u201cI thought I\u2019d show you the options and let you decide. I also have panna cotta setting in the fridge, but I haven\u2019t made the berry coulis for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He led her to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>There were candles scattered around and floating in mid-air overhead and soft violin music began playing when he swung the door open. The lights were slightly dimmer than was truly ideal of cooking.</p>\n<p>Hermione stopped and stared.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be advisable to set the mood early so that you didn\u2019t at any point forget that I\u2019m seducing you tonight,\u201d he said in a low voice, glancing over at her through his lashes.</p>\n<p>Her cheeks flushed and he was sorely tempted to just skip the mental seduction and back her into the doorframe until his body was pressed against her lush curves and try to kiss her into a daze.</p>\n<p>She slipped into the kitchen ahead of him and he stood wavering as he stared after her. Her dress was backless all the way down to the small of it with a very small ribbon that tied in a bow across her shoulder blades. He could see the indentation of her spine and he wanted to run his tongue up it and then push aside her hair and kiss her neck as he untied the ribbon and slid the straps of her dress over her shoulders.</p>\n<p>Draco felt his cock stir and fought against the urge to go smack himself upside the head with a cast-iron frying pan. The plan was seducing her, not unceremoniously ravishingly her on the kitchen table. Which would be\u2014delightful.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d he said in a tight voice joining her beside the array of ingredients he had laid out earlier. \u201cSo the panini options are; brie, braised Bartlett pear, and prosciutto with a balsamic reduction and arugula or alternatively, sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, Ni\u00e7oise olives, and roasted bell peppers.\u201d</p>\n<p>He summoned a bottle of wine from across the room and poured them both a full glass.</p>\n<p>Hermione clutched the goblet he offered her as though it were a Draught of Peace and gulped a large mouthful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought,\u201d he said in what he hoped sounded like a low conversational tone,\u201d we could taste test the options and see what you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione reached for the silverware drawer and Draco quickly reached over and caught her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, this is a seduction,\u201d he reminded her.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-now?\u201d she stammered, staring up at him. \u201cI thought that part was happening later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. The seduction is the entire evening,\u201d he explained patiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Hermione said in a strained voice. \u201cSo, cooking dinner together is\u2014that was\u2014you were trying to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said, feeling grateful that he\u2019d had an entire week to come to terms with the fact that she\u2019d been oblivious the entire time. \u201cCooking for you has always been for the purpose of trying to seduce you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said in the same tone of voice she used when she\u2019d just solved an advanced arithmancy problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and his voice was only faintly aggrieved. \u201cNow, would you like me to feed you a pear or an olive first?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Um. A pear?\u201d</p>\n<p>He reached over and nabbed one and held it to her lips. She blushed scarlet and looked away as she took a small nibble at the edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Hermione. That\u2019s not the right way at all. Open your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>She parted her lips obediently as though he were about to insert a thermometer. He placed the slice of pear on her tongue, meeting her eyes and then drew his hand back and slipped his fingers into his own mouth and slowly sucked on them.</p>\n<p>Her eyes darkened incrementally as she stared up at him.</p>\n<p>But then she looked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite good,\u201d she said in a wobbling voice. \u201cLet\u2019s just go with the pear version.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed internally.</p>\n<p>It was clear that kitchen seduction was quite possibly just a lost cause with her. Fortunately he had anticipated there likely being several failed approaches and had planned the evening accordingly. Perhaps once there was more wine she\u2019d be more receptive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you start the raspberry coulis while I assemble the paninis?\u201d he asked, summoning an apron for her from a drawer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stole your regular apron last week,\u201d he reminded her with a smirk. \u201cAnd remind me to return your shoes and robes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her ears turned visibly pink as she pulled the apron over her head and hurried across the room toward the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d he said sometime later, when her blush had faded and she was sedately simmering berries on the stovetop and mixing a vinaigrette. \u201cI did some poking about this last week in my family\u2019s library. I think you're right about the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said, brightening.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said as he approached her and noticed that she immediately tensed. \u201cThere were several books I thought might be promising. Several are written in old English, so they\u2019ll need some translating. Another is a French journal, written by one of my Malfoi ancestors before he immigrated to England. Although,\u201d he added with a smirk, \u201cthe sections of alchemy are a bit interspersed with a great many descriptions of his daily \u2018horizontal refreshments.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione turned pink again and she drained half her glass of wine in one go. Draco refilled it without a word and studied her carefully. Her cheeks were developing a much redder flush to them than her rose blush provided.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll lend them to you, if you want,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you end up wanting to read them together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him a long pensive look and then turned away from him and seemed to be reaching for her wine again. Draco sighed and slipped the goblet out of her reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione... I\u2019m not going to stop being your friend if this evening goes badly,\u201d he said. Then he froze and a cold realization began to dawn him as he watched her continue to look away and nervously fidget beside him, gnawing her lip.</p>\n<p>His grip on the goblet tightened for a moment as he tried to keep his tone light, \u201cGranted I may need some space to regrow my ego and try to move on. But\u2014this isn\u2019t some kind of ultimatum. If that\u2019s why you\u2019re here\u2014\u201c he clenched his jaw for a moment, \u201cwe should just stop now. We can resume the book club next week and I\u2019ll pretend this never happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you said last week that \u2018this,\u2019\u201d she gestured between them, \u201cwas the whole reason we\u2019d been having a book club for the last two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>He took in a sharp breath and swallowed bitterly. \u201cYes, well, that was when I thought you were aware that I\u2019ve been trying to seduce you this whole time. I didn't realize I was blindsiding you. I didn\u2019t mean to corner you into thinking you had to. You should\u2014,\u201d he tried not so stare at her as dull throbbing sensation steadily swallowed his chest, \u201cprobably go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He started to turn away, suddenly needing hard liquor. He was currently in dire need of drinking himself insensate.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m interested,\u201dHermione said sharply in the swotty, obstinate voice that she generally used when lecturing people about House-elves. He stilled and turned back to find her putting her hands on her hips and glaring up at him. \u201cYou said you\u2019d seduce me tonight. You even sent me an invitation in the post. I went clothes shopping and I\u2019m positive you know how much I hate clothes shopping. It took me all day to find this dress.\u201d She tugged at the fabric beneath her apron. \u201c Now you\u2019re trying to cancel just because I\u2019m a bit nervous. Well, I\u2019m sorry but no one has ever invited me over to be seduced before. There aren\u2019t any books about what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>She huffed and turned away for a moment to stir the coulis vigorously before glaring over her shoulder at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I was interested ages ago, but you just\u2014never made a move,\u201d she said, tossing a hand up in apparent despair. \u201cYou\u2019d invite me over to make handmade pasta and feed me imported chocolates and turn on music and have us salsa dancing around the kitchen but you never tried anything or said anything about liking me or wanting to date me. When we went to museums or bookstores or even the vineyards you never <em> asked </em> to take me to any of them, you\u2019d just mention that you were going and say I could come if I wanted to. So, I just assumed that it was how you were; that you had, had\u2014,\u201d she stammered slightly and glanced away. \u201cThat you had a line that you didn\u2019t want us to cross, and I tried not to do anything that would make it seem like I was trying to cross it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stood blinking at Hermione, trying to absorb everything she\u2019d just said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDefine ages ago,\u201d he finally said.</p>\n<p>She stared intently down into the coulis as though it were a scrying mirror. \u201cI thought back when you first asked me to have dinner here that it meant something. But\u2014then you didn\u2019t ever so much as kiss me on the cheek and you always went to events with other people. You never seemed particularly enthusiastic about having me over when your other friends were. So I just assumed that I wasn\u2019t supposed to read into anything\u2014that you were just joking around; that flirting is your way of being friendly, and that you were the same way with everyone. I was afraid that if I was misinterpreting and then you realized that I was\u2014that I was interested, that it might make things awkward.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Draco moaned and then proceeded to down Hermione\u2019s entire glass of wine. He set the goblet down on the counter and leaned over and buried his face in his arms for several minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease kill me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust bludgeon me to death with something; the frying pan, the panini press, the meat mallet...anything. I don\u2019t think I can live with this anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>He felt fingertips rest lightly on his shoulder, \u201cDraco\u2026 what\u2014was there something you were waiting for me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d he said in a muffled voice, his face still in his arms. He raised his head and looked over at her and then forced himself to stand up and straighten his clothes and pretend that he was still somewhat suave and dignified. \u201cI thought that, seeing as you are a Gryffindor, eventually if you were interested you\u2019d\u2014make the some kind of move or say something. I thought my interest was established. So\u2026 I just tried to give you openings to take the next step, if you wanted. But,\u201d he sighed heavily, \u201cYou would always just laugh or look away or poke me in the side and start talking about something else, so I concluded you weren\u2019t\u2014weren\u2019t there yet\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice trailed off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to rush you by trying to make you spell out define what we were doing, so that\u2019s why I tried not to ever frame our trips as dates. That\u2019s why I never asked you to go to any public events and why I tried not to have you around my friends that much. They all regarded you as being my girlfriend, I was afraid they\u2019d try to help me out by saying something and pressure you about our relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Hermione said, \u201cso all those times when you would help me off the horses or put your hand out to balance me on the ladders in the library, or after you helped me off the counter last week, you were trying to give me opportunities to do\u2014something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave a short nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Hermione said and turned back to the coulis, looking thoughtful as she turned off the heat and cast a pureeing charm on it. Then she dipped a spoon in and tried it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe raspberries were rather tart. It might need more sugar before its strained. Do you want to taste it?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Draco had been somewhat distracted with his general state of shock and feelings of idiocy. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to taste the coulis? It\u2019s a bit tart,\u201d Hermione reiterated.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d he said absently and reached for the spoon. Hermione pulled it away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u201cNo, Draco,\u201d she said, looking at him from under her lashes mischievously, \u201cthat\u2019s not the right way at all. Open your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stared at her for a moment before opening his mouth. She slipped the spoon toward his mouth but, rather than insert it neatly, she grazed his lower lip slightly. He could feel the raspberry sauce catch on his mouth and darted his tongue out to catch it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou missed a bit,\u201d she told him with a smirk.</p>\n<p>He brought up his thumb but before he could wipe his lips she reached out and caught his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco\u2026 this is part of the seduction,\u201d she said in a low purr.</p>\n<p>He stilled and looked at her. He was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t misunderstanding her, but his confidence in \u00a0his ability to understand anything was pretty irreparably shattered at that particular moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d she said and stepped closer to him. \u201cI had thought since I was the one invited over to be seduced that you would kiss me. However, since you\u2019re looking a bit addled, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to be the one to do this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She raised herself onto her toes and pressed her lips against his. He felt her tongue dart out and slide across his lower lip. It was like an electric shock straight through his body.</p>\n<p>Then she stepped back and raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe coulis definitely needs more sugar,\u201d she said and started to turn to head toward the baking cabinet.</p>\n<p>Draco reached out, grabbed her wrist and dragged her into his arms. Her expression was distinctly smug and unsurprised as he crushed her against himself and glared down at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he growled as he studied her eyes, which were darkened, and her cheeks, which were flushed. \u201cYou are going to be the death of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he dipped his head down and captured her lips with his. Hermione made a pleased kittenish sort of noise in the back of her throat and gripped his shirt as she kissed him back.</p>\n<p>She tasted like raspberries and wine and something uniquely Hermione. He nipped her lips and then delved his tongue inside her mouth; sliding along and entwining it with hers as his hands roamed across her body and he pulled her up into his arms and set her down on the counter and wrapped her legs around his waist.</p>\n<p>He had been dreaming of this moment for ages. Imagined iterations of it again and again until he\u2019d worried he was setting himself up to be disappointed if the moment ever did come.</p>\n<p>He had been mistaken. His fairly vivid imagination could not top the thrill of finally getting to kiss Hermione Granger after waiting to do so for years.</p>\n<p>His hand skimmed over the bare skin of her back, gliding his fingers along her spine. He felt her gasp against his lips. He pulled her against himself more tightly and brought up a hand to tangle in her uncharacteristically neat hair. He slid his fingers among the curls and gripped it as he drew his lips away from hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, I have been dying to kiss you,\u201d he muttered before pressing his mouth against hers again.</p>\n<p>His heart was pounding as though he\u2019d just dived and caught a snitch. The entire universe seemed faded away until there was nothing left but Hermione in his arms, her satin tongue gliding against his lips, her curves under his hands, and the sensation of her fingers slipping along his neck like a whisper.</p>\n<p>Kissing her was\u2014Magic; a rush through his whole body. She gave breathy little whimpers and tugged at his hair, and it sent a shiver through his body and down to his cock. He pressed himself against her more firmly and moaned.</p>\n<p>He slid his hand out of her hair and cradled her cheek in his hand, sliding his thumb across the arch of her cheekbone as he tilted her head back and pulled away from her mouth in order to drop kisses along her jaw up to her ear.</p>\n<p>She keened and tangled her fingers more firmly in his hair.</p>\n<p>His fingers found the bow over her shoulders and he fought against the urge to tug it loose and let her dress slide off.</p>\n<p>But, while having sex with her in his kitchen was definitely on the extensive to-do list he had in regard to her, it was not where he wanted their first time to be.</p>\n<p>He reluctantly pulled his hand away and stepped back after giving her one final, searing kiss.</p>\n<p>Then he studied her. She was glassy-eyed and her chest was heaving as she stared up at him. Her curls were a riot. Her lipstick was gone and her lips were red and bee-stung. Her eyes were dark. It was the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever laid eyes on.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI guess I am at a seduction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted and twined his fingers with hers. \u201cNotice that, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the impression I\u2019m getting, but\u2026 then again, I may be mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco wasn\u2019t intending to but he growled and\u2014</p>\n<p>He was kissing her again.</p>\n<p>Was there a reason he\u2019d stopped? He couldn\u2019t recall. It seemed dreadfully unimportant and probably mistaken; whatever that reason had been. Because there was nothing on earth that could be more important than finally getting to kiss her. To finally show her everything he had been waiting to show her. To finally pour out the depth of feeling he had been reining in for so long.</p>\n<p>God, her lips. They felt like silk against his. And her curls. The number of highly indecent dreams he\u2019d had involving her curls...</p>\n<p>He slipped his tongue into her mouth again. She whimpered and used her legs, still around his waist, to pull him more firmly against herself. He wrapped his arms around her and ravished her mouth until he felt light-headed. She was beginning to claw at his shoulders and the bite of pain only added fuel to the maelstrom beginning to roar through his veins. He drew his mouth away and peppered open mouthed kisses along her neck before nipping her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou perfect, perfect creature,\u201d he breathed, and slid the tip his tongue along her throat, and groaned at the taste of her skin before nibbling on her ear.</p>\n<p>She gave a ragged gasp and clung to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco\u2014Draco\u2014,\u201d she panted, \u201cI am most thoroughly seduced. Please, please shag me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh right, that was why he had stopped kissing her. He drew back slightly with a groan at the loss of contact and looked at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t fed you yet,\u201d he said. It was the only coherent thing he force out as he struggled to think of something other than the taste of her skin under his tongue, the softness of her lips, the feeling of her body crushed against his, and his absolutely throbbing erection.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026\u201d she said and began unbuttoning his shirt in order to emphasize the point.</p>\n<p>Minx. He didn\u2019t mean to but somehow he found himself untying her apron and pulling it over her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have chocolates,\u201d he added dazedly, as he noticed her nipples jutting through the fabric of her dress in hard peaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said again. \u201cFeed them to me afterward. Or tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clever witch. She had such an exceptional mind. It was why he fell for her in the first place. What man wouldn\u2019t want to chance to engage with a woman so stunningly intelligent and stunningly stunning?</p>\n<p>Later. Tomorrow. Excellent, excellent, positively ingenious options.</p>\n<p>That worked, didn\u2019t it? Was there anything he was forgetting? He didn\u2019t think\u2014</p>\n<p>Oh fucking hell. He gasped and his vision wavered for a moment. Hermione had finished unbuttoning his shirt and proceeded to dip her head down and drag her tongue up his torso all the way to his collarbones.</p>\n<p>He caught her face in his hands and kissed her ruthlessly until her body was arched taut against him, and her arms were wrapped around his neck as though she feared she\u2019d be torn from him. Then he pulled his lips away momentarily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am seducing you,\u201d he reminded her firmly. \u201cSeducer.\u201d he gestured toward himself. \u201cSeducee.\u201d He held her by the chin and brushed their lips lightly together. She shivered.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014it\u2019s more efficient if we\u2019re both doing it,\u201d she said in a cajoling voice that had an ability to turn him into liquid inside. \u201cBesides, using titles as a means of controlling behavior stunts creativity.\u201d She leaned forward and began nibbling on his collarbones while her right hand slid down his torso toward his trousers. He caught her hand firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a cheeky, little know-it-all,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cBut if you wanted to make the rules of a seduction you should have invited me over to your flat. My house, my rules. This is <em> my </em> seduction. I\u2019ve been planning it all week. Despite your exceptional talent for sidetracking me, there is a written agenda and it doesn\u2019t include any references to having sex on a kitchen counter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could apparate us to your room,\u201d she purred, and shifted her hips in a rolling motion against his groin. He groaned and dropped his head against her shoulder. \u201cOr were you planning for us to end up on the dining room table or in front of the fireplace?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, eventually, definitely, he was thinking of both those places.</p>\n<p>\u201cBedroom,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plan for tonight was the bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tried to think clearly but she kept nibbling on his neck and her hands were doing sinful things to his torso. He jerked and felt his cock throb painfully as she slid a fingernail over his nipple and flicked it. He groaned and nipped at her neck while his hands slid inside her dress and he cupped her breasts. Soft. Perfect. The weight in his palms\u2026 He found her pebbled nipples and caressed them lightly with his fingertips. Hermione made a deep, strangled noise in the back of her throat and the sound went straight to his cock. He hissed and ground himself against her pelvis.</p>\n<p>\u201cBedroom then,\u201d she gasped. \u201cNow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nearly apparated them right then and there but stopped himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s it\u2019s frowned upon to invite a witch to dinner and then shag her before the meal,\u201d he pointed out, even as he withdrew a hand from her breast in order to slide it up her skirt. He slid his fingers along her inner thigh until he found her knickers and then pressed his thumb against the fabric. She was sopping wet and her whole body had begun trembling; her fingers momentarily stilled from their thorough exploration of his abdominal muscles.</p>\n<p>He captured her lips in a tender kiss as he dragged a knuckle lightly against her clit and Hermione shook and whimpered against his mouth. He flicked his tongue out along her lower lip and caressed it as he kneaded her breast and began drawing slow circles over her knickers with his thumb.</p>\n<p>She was clutching as his shirt as though she were about to fall and shifted her hips further forward as she parted legs on the edge of the counter. He steadied her carefully.</p>\n<p>It occurred to Draco as he continued to drag his thumb over her knickers that oral sex wasn\u2019t technically sex. He slid his index finger along her covered core and she choked and jerked against him.</p>\n<p>He could, he thought to himself, get on his knees, tug her knickers off, and taste her. Run his tongue along her folds, suck and tease her clit and then delve into her cunt and he wouldn\u2019t <em> technically </em> be disregarding any of his written agenda.</p>\n<p>An orgasm in the kitchen before dinner could classify as an hors d\u2019oeuvre or aperitif, or something. Tasting her\u2014that would definitely succeed in stimulating his appetite\u2026</p>\n<p>Although not for paninis.</p>\n<p>He rolled the tip of her puckered nipple between his fingers while he slipped his tongue into her mouth and along her teeth. She was shivering. His hand against her knickers kept lightly, lightly stroking and teasing her cunt. He could smell her arousal as she parted her legs wider and shifted her hips, seeking a specific point of friction and pressure that he wasn\u2019t yet providing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019ve cooked dinner for me a least\u2014a hundred times by now,\u201d Hermione said in a breathy groan against his mouth as she made a very weak attempt at drawing away from him. \u201cBesides\u2014oh fuuuck\u2014!\u201d Her voice abruptly cut off when he pressed the heel of his hand firmly against her. She bucked against it and knocked her head slightly against the cabinet behind her.</p>\n<p>She grabbed hold of the hand between her legs and stilled it. There was a heavy, rose flush across her cheeks, and her lips were parted as she tried to catch her breath. Her eyes were black and nearly glazed with arousal, but she was still managing to glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014,\u201d she panted, \u201cI am pretty sure that it is frowned upon to invite a witch over to be seduced and then argue with her when she is asking you very nicely to take her up to your bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>As she was speaking she slipped a hand into his trousers, and wrapped her fingers firmly around his cock. Draco\u2019s whole body shook as she squeezed; he thrust involuntarily and felt his balls draw up as he fought off an immediate desire to explode in her hand. His fingers on her breast squeezed reactively.</p>\n<p>Fucking hell.</p>\n<p>He jerked her hand away before she could do anything else and stood panting and trying to regain his bearings. He was absolutely burning for her. Every muscle in his body felt drawn taut.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d meant\u2014he\u2019d meant for them to talk. For him to have more time to try to communicate everything he\u2019d thought had been understood between them. He wasn\u2019t sure if she knew how seriously he regarded the evening.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately he was finding it quite difficult to form any complete thoughts that weren\u2019t primarily about apparating immediately upstairs.</p>\n<p>He was afraid he might annoy her if he tried to stop things again. They could talk later, he hoped. Assuming things went well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFair point,\u201d he finally managed to say and wrapped an arm around her waist as he buried his head against her shoulder. \u201cBut let the record show that dinner was delayed at your request and I <em> only </em> gave in to this breach of protocol because I take my duties as host so seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he dragged her into his arms and apparated them upstairs. They reappeared in the middle of his bed and proceeded to topple over into the pillows.</p>\n<p>Oh god, the sight of her on his bed.</p>\n<p>He stared down at her trying to commit it to memory; trying to notice every detail. Her curls were spread across his pillow, her eyes dark and sultry in the low light as she looked up at him. Her dress was askew and he could make out her nipples and the dip of her waist and even the outline of her navel as the fabric pooled over her.</p>\n<p>Just looking at her was enough to set him on fire. Except he was already on fire and had been since the moment she\u2019d arrived at his front door. He could feel his cock throbbing and fought against the desire to just rip her knickers off and drive into her.</p>\n<p>She was already wet. He knew she was wet.</p>\n<p>His hands were shaking and he could feel sweat breaking out along his neck and between his shoulders. He had to pace himself. Pace himself and show her what he hadn\u2019t told her yet; that he adored her; that he was already head over heels in love for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014are so lovely,\u201d he said, his voice rasped slightly as he slid a hand along her neck and up to her cheek.</p>\n<p>She arched up and pressed her lips against his and he sank down on top of her with a groan; feeling her curves moulding against his body.</p>\n<p>Just kissing her would never get old. The taste of her. The sensation of her tongue sliding against his. The criminally unhelpful sounds she made against his mouth.</p>\n<p>He pulled away from her lips and pressed kisses down her throat and slid a hand behind her back to find the tie on her dress. It only took the slightest tug and he felt the bow come undone. Then he drew the straps slowly off her shoulders and felt almost afraid to breathe.</p>\n<p>There was a possibility that he was hallucinating the entire thing. After two years of fantasizing it was distinctly possible that he\u2019d finally cracked and the entire thing was just a vivid dream. If he abruptly woke up alone in bed he would probably end up burning down his townhouse and fleeing the continent.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you real?\u201d he found himself asking.</p>\n<p>Hermione blinked and smiled faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said in a lilting tone. \u201cI have been given to understand that I am. Of course, there is a hypothesis shared by some in the field of theoretical physics that the universe is just a hologram. But, if that ends up being the case, you\u2019re a hologram too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorted.</p>\n<p>Then he drew her dress away further, finally revealing her breasts. His hand stilled as he just stared, until she twitched, and shifted and looked self-conscious for the first time.</p>\n<p>He dipped his head down and pressed a kiss on the top of her left breast, over her heart. Then he kissed and licked lightly between them, while his left hand began lightly kneading her right breast. Stroking his fingertips lightly over the top and then along the sensitive underside until she was whimpering. He spent several minutes kissing around the circumference, and then laving and stroking them until she was gasping.</p>\n<p>He wanted to memorize everything about them. Every spot where she quivered and moaned.</p>\n<p>He dropped feather light kisses in a trail from one to the other while he kept lightly fondling them. Then he finally caught her right nipple gently between his teeth, and curled his tongue against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh goooood,\u201d Hermione wailed and her fingers tangled in his hair, pulling on it hard enough to hurt as she held his mouth against her breast. She shifted her hips and ground against his thigh. He pressed himself against her hip with a moan of his own as he continued to swirl his tongue against her sensitive flesh.</p>\n<p>He sucked and teased, and dropped dozens of kisses on her aching nipple while his right hand continued to fondle and tease her left breast; wrapping his fingertips to span around it and then slowly drawing them up toward her nipple and nearly brushing against it, before pulling his hand away to repeat the motion. Finally he pulled his mouth away from her right nipple with a faint pop and leaned over to take her left nipple into his mouth, grazing it faintly with his teeth before wrapping his tongue around it and sucking. She was nearly sobbing.</p>\n<p>He slowly drew away in order to pull her dress off, and then paused to drink her in. She was wearing nothing but white lace knickers. He leaned down again and began journeying with his mouth down the length of body. He slipped his tongue teasingly into her navel and felt her shiver, looking up to find her staring intensely at him. He smirked and held her gaze as he slid further down her body and paused at her hip bones. He sucked hard just above the bone and watched the spot darken. Then he brushed the tender flesh lightly with his fingers, and kissed it.</p>\n<p>He dragged a lazy finger along the edge of her knickers and felt her breath catch. He ducked his head to hide his smile as he slid past, and started pressing kisses along her thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cBastard\u2026\u201d she hissed and he heard her head drop back onto the pillow. He chuckled against her skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this night for two years, if I can still be patient then so can you,\u201d he said before curling his tongue along the inside of her knee. He made a mental note when it got a muted response.</p>\n<p>He ran the tip of his tongue along her inner calf and felt her shake, then pressed a kiss in the dip beneath the bone of her ankle. She gave a muffled moan.</p>\n<p>Interesting.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a foot kink, Granger?\u201d he drawled. She turned bright red.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly.</p>\n<p>He quirked an eyebrow as he caressed her ankle and then drew his fingers lightly over the top and pressed several kisses along the instep. Hermione gave a strangled gasp and quite nearly arched off the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, hiding her face in her hands and then peeking over her fingers at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2014when I asked\u2014someone else\u2014to touch them once, he\u2014he started calling me mistress. I hated that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco chuckled. \u201cDuly noted,\u201d he said as he flicked his tongue between her toes. She whimpered and twisted her fingers among the sheets, but then drew her foot away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think I want to explore kinks tonight,\u201d she muttered, still scarlet-faced. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said immediate agreement; his heart skipping a beat as he registered her implication that there might be future nights.</p>\n<p>He lifted her other foot up and rested it on his shoulder as he started kissing his way back up. When he reached her opposite hip he leaned forward and captured her lips and kissed her for several minutes, crushing their bodies together. The sensation of her bare breasts pressed against his chest radiated heat through him.</p>\n<p>Her fingers tangled in his hair and then slid over his shoulders, pushing his shirt off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re overdressed,\u201d she murmured against his mouth, before tearing herself away from him and sitting up to pull it off. She raised herself up on her knees and began kissing and nibbling along his shoulder. He shivered and the sensation of her lips brushing along his body made him tingle right up into his scalp. He let his head fall back with a groan and felt her fingers sliding along his arms. \u00a0Her hand grazed the location of his faded mark. His blood abruptly ran cold and he jerked his arm away. Hermione stilled and looked up at him with a soft gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the past,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>He clenched his jaw and felt frozen; dragged from the moment he\u2019d gotten so lost it. \u201cIt\u2014I still feel like it defines me. Especially when it comes to you. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything felt abruptly futile. He was delusional. He was Icarus flying up toward the sun and somehow he\u2019d expected to get away with it.</p>\n<p>But now he was remembering himself. Everything was cold. As cold as his manor, where he had stood and watched the woman he was now trying to woo when she was tortured. Cold. It was always going to be cold; right up until he just died from it.</p>\n<p>He ran a hand through his hair and sighed and tried to gather himself.</p>\n<p>Then there was heat, against his hand and brushing against his face and Hermione was still there. Brushing her lips against his cheek as she laced her fingers with his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou apologized to me on your knees,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here, I wouldn\u2019t have ever come to your house that first night for dinner if I hadn\u2019t meant it when I said I forgave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pressed her lips against him chastely. \u201cI forgave you, Draco Malfoy. Leave it in the past now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He returned her kiss slowly and she deepened it. Urging his arms to wrap back around her until she was crushed in his embrace and heat began radiating between them again.</p>\n<p>Soft. Delicate. Powerful. Brilliant. In his bed. His bed.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t known it was possible to want a person to such a consuming degree. He wanted her; every bit of her. Just burned for her. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t stop himself from hoping until his heart ached that he could somehow convince her to stay with him.</p>\n<p>She nipped at his lip, and then coaxed his tongue into her mouth as she arched the length of her body against his bare chest.</p>\n<p>She was like spring. Warm and sweet and lush. Vibrating with life and potential. Radiating warmth that thawed everything around her as surely as if she were the sun. Just touching her was an such a rush of vibrancy he felt he could be swallowed by it.</p>\n<p>Her parents should have named her Persephone.</p>\n<p>Her hands slid down and began unbuttoning his trousers, and shoving his remaining clothing off of him. When he was stripped, he looked up to find her studying him with an expression of greedy appreciation. It did marvelous things for his mood and ego. He felt himself twitch.</p>\n<p>She reached a hand out and caressed his cock. He groaned and stared as she wrapped her fingers around it and slid them slowly along the length several times. Then she ducked her head down with clear intent, and he caught her and dragged her away. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he told her firmly. \u201cI have plans for this night that involve coming in here.\u201d He slid a lazy hand over her lower abdomen and grazed her pelvis so that she jerked. \u201cI\u2019m not taking the risk having you bring things to a premature end.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes but there was a faint smile playing on her lips. He swallowed it with a searing kiss. Draco kissed her cheeks and tangled a hand in her hair as he ran a hand down her back to and along the curve of her arse, while she whimpered and panted near his ear. Clinging to his shoulders.</p>\n<p>He pressed her back down onto the bed and kissed and nipped his way down her arms to her fingers. Then he sucked each one into his mouth, his hands fondling her breasts. Her eyes slid closed as she whimpered and began to writhe beneath him.</p>\n<p>When she was incoherent with sensation he finally slipped a hand down and drew her knickers off. He heard her breath catch as he slid his hand over her pelvis and caressed the thatch of curls between her legs.</p>\n<p>He glanced up and found that her eyes were scrunched closed and her fingers gripping the sheets tightly as she lay frozen. Her expression almost tense as though she were bracing herself against something.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d he murmured and dropped a kiss over the mark he\u2019d left on her hip. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this for ages and yet you are somehow managing to exceed all my fantasies.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted and started to open her mouth in what was undoubtedly a retort, but he cut her off by lowering his mouth between her legs. He watched her face as he slid out his tongue and gave a long, slow, stroke against her swollen flesh. Her expression twisted and she arched up off the bed with a ragged wail. He pressed a hand against her abdomen to hold her in place as his tongue flicked out again and curled around her clit. He kissed it softly and then delved his tongue in deeper; sliding into her core and feeling her muscles flutter and clench in response. Her fluids slipped out and coated his chin until he was nearly dripping from it. The heady smell of her arousal made his cock ache so insistently he shifted and pressed it against the edge of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she sobbed as he drew his mouth away momentarily to gently kiss her sensitive nub and then let his tongue glide over it again. Watching her slowly come apart for him felt like something religious, sacred. Staggering.</p>\n<p>His heart was pounding hard enough to hurt as he slid his hand off her stomach and entwined his fingers with hers; she squeezed it tightly.</p>\n<p>He continued to tease her clit as he slowly sank a finger into her. She was slick, and molten, and gripped him like a vise as his tongue continued to play softly against the cluster of nerves under his tongue. After a minute he added a second finger and sank them deeper inside of her as he sought out a specific location behind her pelvis; maintaining his relentless assault again her center. She was arching and gripping his other hand until her knuckles grew white. When Draco found the spot inside of her that he wanted, he curled his fingers and pressed firmly inside her as he lashed his tongue firmly against her clit. He could feel her grow so taut she vibrated, and then made a guttural choking sound before proceeding to shatter under him.</p>\n<p>She bucked and writhed and sobbed out her orgasm and then finally lay limp as he withdrew his hand from inside her and moved up her body.</p>\n<p>She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>\n<p>She reached out and dragged his body against hers as she kissed him, hungrily. He growled against her lips and she shifted her legs to cradle him between her hips as he aligned himself and then sank into her with a sharp thrust; burying himself to the hilt.</p>\n<p>She was liquid. Liquid heat. Just absolutely perfect. It was difficult not to just come the moment he sheathed inside her. He couldn\u2019t help but marvel over how incredible she felt. How she stretched around him, clenching and squeezing as she gasped against his chest; her hot breath grazing his skin. Draco dropped his head against her shoulder and tried to steady himself before turning to capture her mouth. She wrapped her arms around him and tangled her legs with his as she shifted her hips to meet his thrusts.</p>\n<p>He swallowed hard and tried to steel himself. He could last. He would find a way. He was determined. But she was just perfect and it had been a very long time since he\u2019d had a witch in his bed.</p>\n<p>He tried to go slowly but she dug her heels into his arse and urged him deeper and faster. He gave her what she wanted. He drove into her; long, steady thrusts as he felt her clench around him and her fingernails sink into his shoulders as she clung to him, gasping beneath him. The expression on her face was rapturous.</p>\n<p>He studied it greedily.</p>\n<p>He was doing this to her. His body against her. His cock inside her. He could give her everything she wanted. He would.</p>\n<p>Everything about her was everything, everything that he wanted. He needed to show her. Show her. Make her feel it.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t bear the thought she might wake up the next morning and think that one evening was all they were good for. All he was good for.</p>\n<p>He would probably just die in that case.</p>\n<p>He caught one of her legs and hooked her knee over his shoulder as he bore down, crushing their bodies together, and angling himself more deeply. There was no way one time with her could possibly be enough. There was so much he needed to give her.</p>\n<p>The urge to just let go and pound into her was swallowing him but he forced it back and maintained his pace. Hermione\u2019s head thrashed against the pillow as she clawed at him and sobbed with pleasure. He leaned down and kissed her; ravishing her mouth.</p>\n<p>He rolled a nipple between his fingers and then slid his hand between their bodies as he kept driving into her. She was close, he was certain she was close. He could last until then. He was determined to drag her over the edge again before he followed her. He had to.</p>\n<p>He clenched his jaw and eased his pace marginally as he played his fingers against the swollen flesh of her clit. She stiffened and sobbed, clawed at the sheets.</p>\n<p>\u201cScream for me, Hermione,\u201d he growled as he thrust into her. \u201cI want to hear you scream.\u201d</p>\n<p>She crescendoed with a piercing wail that seemed torn from her. Breaking under him and shivering into pieces as she pulsed around him. He drove into her with long, sharp thrusts as he felt his balls tighten and his mind shatter in an explosion inside of her. The muscles in his pelvis jerked in a sharp involuntary repetition as he pumped his seed into her depths.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck, Hermione,\u201d he gasped.</p>\n<p>A long low groan rippled from him and he felt his face contort with the pleasure that was lashing its way through his body. He shook as his hips continued to thrust and he dropped his head down and then collapsed on top of her.</p>\n<p>He panted and peppered kisses along her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014you are fantastic. Just\u2014better than\u2014anything. Perfect. Absolutely perfect,\u201d he muttered against the juncture of her shoulder. She was boneless under him. Her arms were still wrapped around his neck but she was boneless. He kissed across her cheeks and forehead for several minutes while he tried to catch his breath. Finally he slid reluctantly out of her and sank onto the mattress beside her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorth the two year wait?\u201d she asked in a blurry voice as she rolled over and curled up under his arm.</p>\n<p>He gathered her closer and dropped his other arm possessively over her waist. He dropped several kisses on the top of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019d wait a century,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t take us that long. I don\u2019t know if the sex would be as good if we were centenarians.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Good thing we\u2019re both so smart then,\u201d he said dryly.</p>\n<p>She burst out laughing and buried her face in his chest. Then they lay together. He held her close as he drifted off.</p>\n<p>When Draco woke hours later he found Hermione, redressed and staring down at him pensively. He swallowed and tried to ignore his immediate unease.</p>\n<p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked in a teasing tone, trying not to seem as nervous as he felt.</p>\n<p>She smiled faintly and shook her head, then her face grew serious again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d she began nervously. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve\u2014seduced me\u2014I\u2019m not sure, what\u2014what this is now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco reached out and pulled her toward him. She immediately allowed herself to be drawn in and he felt his pulse quicken hopefully as he dragged her into his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to seduce you is such a habit at this point I expect I\u2019ll just continue doing it for the foreseeable future. Although, I\u2019m hoping that it will have a slightly higher rate of success now,\u201d he told her as he pressed a kiss to her forehead and then another and another.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said in a prim voice, but there was a smile playing about her lips.</p>\n<p>His heartbeat quickened.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d he started slowly, \u201cI\u2019ve got a horrible ministry fundraiser that I\u2019m supposed to appear at next weekend. It\u2019s going to be mind-meltingly awful.\u201d His voice became aggrieved as he stroked her cheek and studied her face. \u201cJust standing around and listening to politicians gladhand and try to wheedle donations out of me. I\u2019d skip it but unfortunately this very insistent little witch told me on no uncertain terms that I had to attend. She\u2019s always there trying to solicit donations for Merfolk sanctuaries and Werewolf halfway houses and House-elf rights advocacy centers. She seems to be under some sort of impression that I have absolutely nothing better to do with my massive family fortune than give it to HER\u2014!\u201c his voice broke off and he yelped as a knuckle drove itself between his ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cConsidering that you bought a townhouse in <em> Belgravia </em> just to seduce someone, I think that is a fairly accurate assessment of your family fortune,\u201d she said in a crisp voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said, lowering his eyes demurely. \u201cBut the point still stands that I am required to appear at the event next week and I am currently dateless.\u201d His voice dropped suggestively, hopefully, \u201cI may be more amenable to making large donations to House-elf rights if I weren\u2019t so lonely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, a charity date then?\u201d Hermione said in a bland tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking of something more long-term,\u201d he growled, rolling and pulling her underneath himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand,\u201d she said in a saucy voice as he began kissing her neck. \u201cI\u2019m a Gryffindor, sometimes subtlety <em> eludes </em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drew away from her neck in order to stare down at her face and braced himself to bare his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe my girlfriend, Hermione,\u201d he said nervously. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for years. I will do anything it takes to deserve you and make you happy. I will give you the world if you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really need the world; running the DRMC is more than enough work. However, I think I\u2019ve been in love with you for a while now too,\u201d she said, reaching up to rest her hand on his cheek. \u201cI would very much like to be your girlfriend, Draco Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her for several minutes. When they finally broke apart she smirked up at him teasingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I really have many other options.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAt this point you\u2019ve set the bar so terribly high that now I highly doubt anyone else will ever be able to seduce me.\u201d</p>"
