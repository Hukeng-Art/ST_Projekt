  "text": "<p>Bakugou mumbles \u2013 or at least he used to. When they were kids Bakugou would mumble under his breath constantly, by the time they were three Midoriya had picked up the habit, except he didn\u2019t grow out of it when Bakugou did. As teens, Midoriya mutters all. the. time. and it really pisses Bakugou off. He knows Midoriya knows how annoying it is, he always used to tell Katsuki to speak up and now the damn nerd mutters his way through all his interactions \u2013 a habit he can't seem to break. Tch, the fucking hypocrite.</p>\n<p>Class 1a find out that Bakugou mumbles too in a hero study lesson. Of course, they think he got it from Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Hero study was Midoriya\u2019s favourite lesson, and if you asked Bakugou he might grudgingly admit that he liked learning about old and present heroes slightly more than their practical lessons. Only slightly. And only if you got him in a good mood. After all, Midoriya wasn\u2019t the only kid who liked looking at and analysing quirks \u2013 he was just the obsessive one. In this particular hero study lesson, they were looking at how to utilise the quirks of teammates. The task was relatively simple \u2013 \u2018you have a teammate with an animorph quirk, use them to de-escalate a hostage situation\u2019 \u2013 and they were to work either by themselves or in pairs. Midoriya was working with Uraraka and Bakugou was working with Kirishima at the redhead's insistence.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, bro what you got, I was thinking they could, like turn into a bull or, or an elephant man that would be so cool \u2013 elephants are so freaking manly you know \u2013 anyway they could be some big ass animal and knock the door down. Take that villain by surprise then we could go in and take him down.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s arms flew through the air as he explained his idea, a smile covering his face as he watched his friend's impassive features.</p>\n<p>\u201cTch. Yeah sure if you want the hostages dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what would you suggest Bakubro, huh?\u201d and honestly if Katsuki wasn\u2019t so tired from being woken up during the night because the clumsy fuck next to his dorm room decided to drop something at fucking midnight, this lesson probably would have gone differently. He probably would have kept his planning in his head, he probably would have seen the challenge in the redhead's gaze. But he was dead tired from his interrupted sleep so that didn\u2019t happen.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I do all the work don\u2019t I,\u201d his eyes rolled, as he tapped his pen against his notebook, gears in his head working on a plan, even as he purposely ignored how fond he sounded when talking about <em>his</em> idiots, \u201cso, we\u2019d need to be inside, get an idea of what's going down, normally you'd call the villain,<em> <small>negotiate that kinda shit but if you have an animorph quirk you need to <small><small>use it'd actually be good to use them especially if they could keep their mic headpiece when<small><small> turning they could be a beetle and allow us to get info from what they pick up or if not a fly and then they <small>could come back to us so we could get the information from them and decide how to operate</small></small></small></small></small></small></em><small><small><small><em>\u00a0\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</em></small></small></small></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the classroom was silent apart from his pen tapping and his \u2013 oh fuck \u2013 his muttering. Oh god fucking damn it. He must be more tired than he thought, he\u2019s gonna kill that Edgar Allen Crow when he next gets the chance.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mutter?!,\u201d round cheeks, of course, \u201cdid you get it from Deku? Why are you so annoyed at him when you do the same thing, huh?\" she leaned forward, \"man, I always forget you two have known each other for, like, forever.\u201d The brunette was kneeling on her chair, her hands on the table, with each pinky lifted \u2013 if another table hit the ceiling they were fairly sure Aizawa would actually cry, chronic dry eyes or not \u2013 he eyes seemingly sparkling at the chance to learn more about the blonde \u2013 who despite being so loud, rarely talked about himself in much detail.</p>\n<p>He saw Deku open his mouth to correct his friend and shook his head slightly, hoping for the first time in years that some of the seemingly telepathic understanding they used to have of the other was still there from their childhood. Apparently, the universe decided he could have a bit of luck, as Iz-Deku's eyes widened and he shut his mouth with his lips upturned slightly and turned his head back to his work. Quietly guiding Uraraka back to their plan without letting her know he was distracting her.</p>\n<p>Izuku swears like a god damn sailor. Honestly, Bakugou has no clue how the nerd is the class \u2018cinnamon bun\u2019. His infamous shitty language is actually something he picked up from the nerd. As children, Deku had picked up on his Aunt Mitsuki's swearing before even her own son did and used it whenever he could, it was only after Inko had explained to the green-haired boy that \u2018swear words weren\u2019t nice words to use\u2019 when they were 4 and she had caught her son calling someone a \u2018god damn bastard\u2019 that he had stopped. But, Katsuki didn\u2019t. Even when Deku, the hypocrite he still swore to no end just not where his mother could hear, told him off for saying 'mean words, you can say them just not aimed at people kacchan'.</p>\n<p>It was a peaceful day, the sky blue and the birds singing. For once, it looked like class 1a would get some peace and quiet...</p>\n<p>\u201cSHIT\u201d \u2013\u201cBakugou that language is not befitting for a future pro hero\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe just some peace...</p>\n<p>\u201cOH FUCK YOU BAKUGO KATSUKI\u201d</p>\n<p>Or not.</p>\n<p>The explosive ash-blond raced past Iida's lecture and hand chops, swearing under his breath as he reached the end of the hallway and jumped the bannister to the stairs rather than waste time turning the corner, he jumped the next railing as well using his quirk to help him land safely in the middle of the common room. Crouched in a landing position he let out a small sigh, hoping to have brought himself a bit of time before a crackle broke through the silence of the common room as the telltale sign of one for all starting up to help the user perform the same manoeuvres the explosion user had done moments before. Red eyes widened as he righted himself as started to run to the door hoping that outside would give him the opportunity to hide.</p>\n<p>\u201cHOLY FUC--\u201d a green blur hit his side tackling him straight into a \u2013 thankfully \u2013 empty sofa. The teens hit the back before bouncing slightly to rest on the sofa for a few moments before wrestling and flailing limbs saw them meet the floor with a thump. When Bakugou realised he was on the top, he started to make a move to get away from the enraged green head \u2013 he got a few steps before Midoriya turned to his front and pulled Bakugou's leg causing him to flail before once again meeting the floor with a thump and muffled swear. The one for all user wasted no time pouncing onto the downed teen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU MOTHERFUCKER I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE YOU\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou turned underneath Midoriya who was now trying to slap the ash-blond who was valiantly trying to block the hits \u2013 which were, to be honest half-hearted at best, Midoriya wasn\u2019t really trying to hurt the blond but was annoyed enough to start a wrestling match with the other \u2013 not unlike the ones they used to have as kids.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, FUCK, Deku fucki-ow stop, I didn't even break the fucking thing IZU <em>GET OFFA ME</em> fuck <em>OW\u00a0 </em>you mother f--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU <em>COULD</em> HAVE FUCKING BROKEN IT. You. Knocked. Over. My. Limited. Edition. All. Might. Figurine.\u201d Each word was punctuated by an attempted slap to the blond's chest, \u201cfuck you fuck you <em>fuck you</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cget off get off <em>get off\u201d</em> Bakugou had given up blocking and was now focusing on getting the green teen off of him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>MIDORIYA</em></strong><em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cshit\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cshit\u201d</p>\n<p>Both teens paused their roughhousing at the class pres\u2019 voice before Bakugou used Midoriya\u2019s pause to get his hand \u2013 palm lifted, he wasn\u2019t about to soak anyone\u2019s shirt with the toxic chemical that was his quirk \u2013 on the other\u2019s chest and push him backwards off of his legs allowing him to scramble up and over the sofa, stood just behind Iida. He wasn\u2019t scared \u2013 he wasn\u2019t \u2013 but even heroes could take shelter, right? <em>Right?!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey Iida, sorry did we distract you, I know you were trying to work, I'm so sorry if we did,\u201d somehow the nerd looks so genuine despite the fact that he was still on the floor, \u201cwe can just go outside right, <em>Katsuki?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Oh, oh he was so fucked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat language is beneath both of you, honestly as hero students and future pros I would hope that you were more professional <em>even</em> in our downtown. And Midoriya, I would expect that kind of language from Bakugou but not yourself. I know you two grew up together so you have been exposed to this language but it is not befitting of students such as yourself, such as <em>either</em> of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou briefly thought of correcting the blue-haired teen on who had <em>really </em>picked up 'that language' from their friend, before he caught his childhood friend\u2019s gaze, and well, he did owe the teen for the \u2018mumbling incident\u2019 and honestly the fact that he knocked over an all might figurine paired with the use of his actual name meant he was already screwed, no need to make it worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah class pres, c'mon nerd, I'll get lunch or some shit for us to make up for the figurine just, for fucks sake, don\u2019t tell mum yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, if we go to that new place then sure\u201d</p>\n<p>The new, expensive, western-style restaurant that Izuku knows he\u2019ll hate. Brilliant.</p>\n<p>\u201cFan-fucking-tastic. Get your ass off the floor than shitty nerd\u201d</p>\n<p>With the two rivals retreating out of the dorm complex, Iida fixed his glasses on his nose before looking over at the two students, Uraraka and Ashido, who had also witnessed the 'incident'.</p>\n<p>\"What, and I can't emphasise this enough, the\u00a0<em>actual<strong> fuck</strong></em>, sorry Iida, just happened? Was Bakubro just nice\" -\"nice-ish\" \"yeah sure, nice-<em>ish</em> to Midoriya of all people?\" when Mina was just met with Uraraka's disbelief and Iida's exasperation, she just leaned back in her seat to look around Uraraka to focus on the door the other two had just left through.</p>\n<p>\"Huh...No one will believe this. Will they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope.\"</p>\n<p>Bakugou had a habit. Although Izuku thought, it was more ingrained than a simple habit. The thing was, Bakugou had always had nitroglycerin for sweat, his quirk developing was actually him gaining the ability to heat his hands up enough to cause explosions. This meant that from very early on, the blond was taught to pick things up only if he really needed to and to minimise his contact with whatever he touched. Nitroglycerin was, after all, toxic and prone to explosions and so Bakugou would always pick things up with his fingertips, avoid touching things belonging to others and often had wipes designed to neutralise any of his sweat that got on to objects he couldn\u2019t dispose of. That wasn\u2019t the problem, in fact, it was clear to those who knew what to look for that Katsuki took quirk management \u2013 especially his own \u2013 very seriously. It was admirable. The problem was that somewhere in their joint childhood, Midoriya had picked up some of these habits. He supposed it was understandable as he'd often been there with his friend when aunty Mitsuki gave the blond a lecture on \u2018making sure everyone else was safe\u2019. He didn\u2019t even mean to pick the habit up \u2013 didn\u2019t even realise that he was doing it until secondary school when the two teens had fully fallen out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Izuku sighed, leaning back in his desk chair away from the homework he was <strong>supposed</strong> to be completing, his mind focusing on everything else \u2013 what's for dinner?, is mum back yet?, why do I have homework? Ugh \u2013 as he reached for the glass next to the all might themed light, fingertips closing around the top before he shifted his grip to allow his fingers to clasp the middle of the glass with his palm lifted. To this day, he doesn\u2019t know what made him realise, hed done that action hundreds of times, had spent his whole life picking things up without them touching his palms. But he did notice it this time. \u201choly shit, I \u2013 what \u2013 I \u2013 oh my go~d\u201d Midoriya groaned as it sunk in that, despite not spending more than ten minutes a day with his old friend for the past few years, he still had this <strong>habit</strong> ingrained into him, in fact as he really looked at his routines he realised it went further than just this \u2013 he kept his hands in his pocket when he wasn\u2019t writing, like Kacchan; he opened doors with his elbows or legs when possible, like Kacchan; he often didn\u2019t touch other peoples stuff if he could help it even if it belongs to a family member, like Kacchan and he only made physical contact with others with his palms lifted, <strong>like Kacchan.</strong> </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be fair, that had been the end of it, in secondary school, he honestly had bigger worries than the fact that he was apparently incapable of picking things up normally \u2013 he tried to stop himself a few times but unless he consciously thought about it, he just used his fingertips \u2013 he was trying out for UA soon and his mum was worried about money and him and school and Kacchan had been slightly worse than usual so there was probably something going on at the other teen's home so he should keep an eye on that <em>and </em>he <strong><em>still</em></strong> had homework to complete. Then before he knew, they <em>were </em>at UA and there were other things to worry about - apparently, that list now included watching his childhood friend get fucking <strong>kidnapped</strong>. So, again, it slipped his mind. Or at least it did until Kaminari brought it up. Although Midoriya supposes, if blame goes to anyone for this <em>revelation </em>it probably should be Yaoyorozu as she was the one who made the electric quirk user aware of <em>Kacchan\u2019s</em> <em>habits</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>\u201cBakugou, could you pass that to me please?\u201d it had been a very quiet day in the dorms for once. Aizawa had briefly stopped by to drop off graded work for them to put in their records and most had already collected theirs, but Iida and Yaoyorozu had been out until now. Katsuki looked over at the worksheets on the counter behind him then back at his classmates. Ugh shit \u2013 he\u2019d been cooking something for the self-proclaimed Bakusquad and the proximity to the heat had caused him to sweat more, plus he was fairly sure the sweatpants he was wearing didn\u2019t belong to him (Denki maybe or actually only mina could own such an offensively bright green article of clothing) so he couldn\u2019t just wipe his palms on them. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cTch, I'll move out your way\u201d he picked up the bowl of food, careful to keep his hands from touching too much of the bowl and placing them where the sweat couldn't run into the food in any way.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBakugou, as a hero student you really should get used to helping others out, you could have passed them to me on your way over here.\u201d The two class presidents sighed in unison, missing the glares sent to them by Kaminari and Ashido \u2013 Midoriya figured if anyone had realised why the blond had chosen to walk away it would be them, they both had quirks with no proper \u2018off switch\u2019 and probably had to be careful themselves what they touched \u2013 Kirishima and Sero also spared the two a glance, clearly unsure on Bakugou\u2019s reason but willing to stick up for him regardless. Izuku was glad that the blond had friends like the ones he found in the Bakusquad. He knew that the power imbalance in their own early friendship after his quirkless diagnosis reminded the blond of his relationship with his parents and was probably one of the reasons that he had acted against the green-haired child so much \u2013 that\u2019s not to say that the fault didn\u2019t lie at Kacchans feet, just that Midoriya, with hindsight, could see that their friendship turning sour was not solely on Bakugou's shoulders after all, Izuku never did know when to let something, or some<strong>one</strong> go. A selfish part of him though was glad he had stuck by the explosive blond \u2013 if he had given up as well, then there would be no friendship for them to fix now and he was glad that they were on their way to the relationship they used to share as kids. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Mido, hey you with me man?\u201d Denki waved their hand in front of the teen's face, \u201cman, you\u2019re really spacing out on me dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, oh sorry just, heh, lost in thought. What was it you wanted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe glass. If you're done with it that is? I was gonna put it by the sink, it's Mina\u2019s turn to do the washing and she wanted to get it all in one go, y\u2019know.\u201d Midoriya smiled up at the yellow-haired teen, passing over the glass completely missing the amused glance from his classmate. Mistake one. Denki placed the glass in the kitchen next to their pink friend, bumping hips with her as they left the kitchen \u2013 they did <strong>not</strong> need to be in the kitchen for extended amounts of time when someone was on washing up duty. \u201cMind if I sit here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm? Oh yeah of course\u201d Mistake two.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Denki began, mischief hidden in golden eyes, \u201cMind if I ask you a question, you can say no of course but, well call me curious but I noticed something ~~ interesting.\u201d they tapped their finger gently against the table as they looked at the freckled teen next to them, before, at the other teen\u2019s nod, turned fully in their seat. \u201cCorrect me if I'm wrong,\u201d they began in a tone that stated clearly that they were <em>very</em> confident in their analysis, \u201cbut you and Bakubro pick things up the same way. Ah-ah-\u201d they steamrolled over Midoriaya's half-assed rebuttal, \u201cthe lifting of the palm is quite,, distinctive. I know why he does it so why do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- uhh, I don\u2019t know to be honest. Honestly, I, dunno, guess I just picked it up from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike the muttering?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe \u2013 how, how the <em>fuck</em> did you-\u201d</p>\n<p>Denki laughed quietly, aware that neither of the teens they were talking about wanted their classmates to overhear, \u201chmm, you went to correct him, it made sense and to be honest,\u201d they leaned forward smiling at their freckled friend, \u201cI didn\u2019t know until you just confirmed it.\u201d Denki laughed again louder this time as midoriya blushed and dropped his head to the table with a thump and swear \u2013 Denki found it adorable, after all, the Bakusquad had seen Bakugou do much the same thing when they got the blond flustered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, ill keep it to myself\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI,... thanks,\u201d</p>\n<p>Denki hummed under their breath, \u201chis quirk is volatile, that why he doesn\u2019t open doors normally right?\u201d at Midoriya's confirmation, Denki decided it was time to push their luck just a little more, \u201cso can I ask, is that why he's so careful touching people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, yeah, yeah it is. You, I mean if you noticed you probably know he\u2019s even worse when it comes to picking -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-picking up belongings, right, that\u2019s kinda what sparked this, I, you don\u2019t have to answer, if it's not your story to tell, just tell me to fuck off, yeah. I mean, according to Mina, you have no problem with that.\u201d The electric quirk user smirked slightly as Izuku turned even redder at the gentle tease, \u201cbut, we- the Bakusquad I mean, were having dinner and he accidentally picked up my chopsticks, and well, he refused to give them back and I know, with his quirk, why but he seemed, man, I don\u2019t know, but <em>frightened</em> I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, oh shit, I mean I ugh, yeah that, that\u2019s my fault actually he, uhm, he put me in the hospital,\u201d Midoriya blushed at his swearing before remembering that the cat was well out of the bag when it came to his language and steamrolled over Denki's stuttering at his statement, \u201cyeah, I guess, I mean it's my story too so I don't mind telling you, basically, uhm, so when we were kids we were having dinner together at mine ---\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Katsuki and Izuku were sat around the Midoriya family kotatsu waiting for Inko to bring their food through so they could watch the new all might episode. Inko strode through over to where the tots were sitting, smiling as she placed their food and chopsticks down. Katsuki nodded his thanks over the table and reached for his pair whilst Izuuku turned to hug her in thanks. In turning, he had knocked into the other\u2019s side causing him to drop one of the chopsticks. The blond placed the other on the table, on his side so Izuku wouldn\u2019t take it, and leaned down to pick up his dropped utensil. Unfortunately, with him nudging the table as he leaned and Izuku rocking it with his turning, the chopstick rolled back towards the centre. Oblivious, Izuku picked it up along with another, placing them both in his mouth as he pulled the bowl towards himself. When Bakugou resurfaced, he saw Izuku and panicked, pulling the chopsticks from the green-haired child\u2019s mouth surprising the child. </em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I had to go to the hospital to get checked out and then stay overnight because I'd ingested some of the nitroglycerin, it had burned my throat and stomach lining, I was fine and it wasn\u2019t Kacchans fault but he was so freaked out that he ended up in hospital as well when he panicked so much he, um, well he blacked out \u2013 in the end, he was in the hospital longer than I was. Ever since he refused to take any utensils before anyone and he doesn\u2019t touch anyone's face with his palm directly if he can help it and yeah.\u201d Midoriya finished with a shrug and looked over at Denki.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, man that\u2019s, actually pretty sweet, I mean, I know you two have a <em>complicated</em> history but it, like, it obviously had a pretty big impact if it still freaks him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I hadn\u2019t, hadn\u2019t thought of that, of it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Denki smiled at the teen who they\u2019d just given what looked like an existential crisis, patting him on the back as they passed to get to Mina.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was all that about Den?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, oh nothing important, race ya to Blasty\u2019s room yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izu and Kacchan had always known that they were going to be heroes \u2013 the best heroes. A hero team in fact. So at three, they had both begged their respective parent(s) to let them join the local dojo. They hit a problem almost immediately after joining \u2013 or at least, then they didn\u2019t know it was a problem, but a few years later and a quirkless diagnosis showed that it was in fact a problem. Izu just couldn\u2019t hold his balance the way Kacchan and the other youths did, he wobbled and standing in the stances everyone else fell into with ease hurt him. So, their Sensei had taken him to one side and showed him another way to stand. He said it was how the stances used to be used until they were adapted to fit quirks but that it was still registered as acceptable. With Deku's diagnosis came the knowledge that he fit the old ways better was because he had the extra joint that had since died out in 80% of the population. There was another issue with Deku's different fighting forms but that only became clear later on \u2013 or at least the two boys weren\u2019t aware of it until later when at UA Kirishima and Kastuki had a friendly sparring match.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even quirkless, Deku was determined to learn how to fight, he could still be useful, he could still help and so he would still fight. He still turned up at the dojo three times a week with Katsuki, and even when they weren\u2019t friends, the Senseis often paired them together \u2013 despite Katsuki's apparent aggression, they were the same age, same height, same weight and to pair them against the older fighters would be worse, besides, with a sensei nearby, Kacchan more often than not behaved very well. The thing is, when they both fight without quirks, they are pretty equal and fighting together all the time meant that they picked up moves from the other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When it came to UA, Deku's <em>unique</em> fighting style actually gave him an advantage, (at the dojo, you get to know how everyone fights, so the others there knew how to compensate for it \u2013 with the added help of knowing both izuku and kacchan for most their lives) no one there had fought against someone or even seen, the <em>quirkless </em>way of fighting. In all honesty, it throws some of the teachers off too, they try to teach the \u2018correct\u2019 way only to be corrected themselves when they are told that this is a <em>recognised form</em> and not actually \u2018dirty moves\u2019 or a form of \u2018street fighting\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the two teenagers were now coming to find out, they had picked up habits and sayings and who knew what else from the other over their childhood. For katsuki, this apparently also applied to fighting style \u2013 in all their years at the dojo, no one \u2013 not one single fucker<em> the traitors</em> \u2013 had thought to inform the ash blond that he had also picked up and started fighting in the old stances.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were foc-ugh fuuuck -\u201d Kirishima sucked in a breath from his position on his back on the ground of the gym, \u201cfocusing on Aikido?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are shitty hair,\u201d Bakugou straightened up from the defensive position he had been in after throwing Kirishima, \u201cget up, it's your turn to try and redirect <em>my</em> hit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"That \u2013 oh holy fuck, how are you able to just <em>chuck</em> me like that - ugh\u201c Kirishima stood up and shook his limbs out, \u201cthat is <em>not</em> an aikido form man, cheating is so <em>not</em> manly dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChea -? I\u2019m, oh fuck you, I'm not <em>cheating. </em>I've always fought like this, it how Deku and I were taught.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s head cocked, not unlike a golden retriever who had had their attention caught by something shiny or an old tennis ball, \u201cYou and Deku learned how to fight together? Wait does he fight like that too?\u201d the bond\u2019s eyes widened slightly at the realisation that he had let slip more information about himself then he wanted. Mentally rolling his eyes, Katsuki fell into form again \u2013 physically rolling his eyes when his sparring partner took in his stance with barely hid confusion and scepticism.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, how many times do you idiots need to be told, me and the nerd grew up together.\u201d He beckoned the redhead to attack him, and as his friend fell into the \u2018correct\u2019 form, carried on with his reluctant explanation \u2013 he knew if he didn\u2019t tell, the redhead would go to the nerd directly at least this way he could control what information was given out \u2013 \u201cDeku has fucking awful balance,\" not a lie - although not exactly the truth either- \"so he was taught the older stances and katas and everything\u201d he ducked under Kirishima's attempt to grab his arm \u201cwe sparred a lot together at the dojo as we were the only kids our age - hah\u201d he jumped back when his jab was directed to far left by his partner's arm, falling back into a ready position looking for a weakness to exploit, \u201cI had to learn based on his fighting style an-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-and you picked it up from him.\u201d Kirishima smiled and nodded at the explanation, losing focus just enough for Bakugou to duck under his defences and land him on his ass again. \u201cugh, duuude.\u201d He blinked at the ceiling before turning his eyes to Katsuki's silhouette, the explosive blond stood with his arms crossed staring down, mouth turned into a slightly amused smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus shitty hair, a villain won't wait for you to focus, again\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cughhhh, Bakubroooo\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki laughed as he walked away, in all honesty, picking up Deku's form of fighting wasn\u2019t the worse thing for him to copy in childhood.</p>\n<p>One of the things that comes with being childhood friends is inside jokes.</p>\n<p>\n<em>For once, it wasn\u2019t Izuku who was crying. The two toddlers had been sitting in Inko\u2019s living room with a bowl of fruit slices in between them when the blond had fallen back and knocked his head on the sofa. Later, Inko thought, it was probably more the shock of going backwards rather than any actual pain that had set the blond off. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAh, Katsuki, hey there little one,\u201d Inko rushed over from the kitchen, having heard crying that didn\u2019t sound like Izuku\u2019s usual cries, \u201clet me have a look honey, okay?\u201d she slowly brought the tot back to sitting and touched the back of his head. \u201cThere we go, okay sweetheart, I think you\u2019re all good.\u201d She smiled at the tot under her care, before her attention shifted to her green-haired child who was slowly shifting his way over to them.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAppa\u201d an apple slice from the bowl the two had been sharing was clutched in Izuku\u2019s hand, thrust towards his crying friend. Katsuki stared at the other toddler before stuffing the entire slice into his mouth, giggling at the startled laugh that Inko gave at the accidental hamster impression.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>----</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Izuku had let himself fall to his knees after an intense hour at the dojo, the three-year-olds hands swiped at his face and he sniffed slightly at the lingering ache in his muscles. Green eyes gazed at his friend who had collected their bags whilst he collected himself.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThank you Kacchan,\u201d he grabbed at the bag in the boys left hand, rising to stand beside the blond, \u201cI did good, right? You did good of course Kacchan is so amazing.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>His blond companion huffed a smile at the praise, turning to dig around in his bag before looking at Izuku, \u201c\u2019course ya did, not just \u2018nyone can be <strong>my</strong></em> <em>hero par\u2019ner. Apple?\u201d the blond smirked at the green-haired tot next to him.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHeh, thank you Kacchan\u201d the apple slice was stuffed hamster style into Izuku\u2019s mouth as the two smiled at each other.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>----</em>\n</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t meant to become a thing. That if one of them was feeling down an apple slice was offered. But it did.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave m- \u201d Katsuki pushed his maybe friend, turning slight stalker at this point, away from him. He had just got out of the house and wanted just ten minutes at the park in peace before his parents came looking for him, \u201cShit, I, c\u2019mon Deku I didn\u2019t mean to make ya fall that hard.\u201d He helped the other up, sighing at the teary eyes that met his, \u201cyou're not hurt that bad right?\u201d at the child\u2019s head shake, Katsuki nodded at him before stalking off.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The next day at lunch, Katsuki offered Izuku an apple slice. Izuku took it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>----</em>\n</p>\n<p>It also wasn\u2019t meant to become a way of checking to see if the other was alright. Even at their worst, the two had grown up together and knew each other had their own struggles.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kacchan hadn\u2019t spoken to him at all today. Which Izuku supposed was a good thing since the other teenager didn\u2019t really have anything particularly nice to say to him unless they were at the dojo and a sensei was near. However, when the blond had stalked past him with his head down that morning it had set all kinds of warning bells of in his head. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The bell had rung for break and Izuku and Katsuki were both dragging their feet for different reasons \u2013 Katsuki wanted to avoid human socialisation as much as possible whilst Izuku was hoping to talk to Katsuki alone, it was always easier to get Kacchan to open up when no one else was there \u2013 there was no point in either of them being particularly closed off around each other when their lives were still so intertwined what with their parents being close friends.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cKacchan-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI'm not in the mood Deku\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, not in the mood to deal with Izuku in particular or not in the mood to deal with anything in general? That was the important question.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cApple?\u201d Deku crossed everything that this wouldn\u2019t backfire.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He watched as all of Katsuki\u2019s back tensed up before each muscle seemed to relax as the boy in front of him manually relaxed himself the way they often did after sparring. Which was \u2026 good?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYeah, fuck, I, god I can\u2019t talk, I don\u2019t want -\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u201d at that Katsuki relaxed fully, \u201cyou could come round mine tonight, if you want,\u201d He passed the teen on his way out, \u201cI don\u2019t have any apple to give you now, so you'll have to if you want your slice.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The explosion user huffed a laugh and tried to conspicuously wipe his eyes with the back of his hand.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>That evening there were three at the Midoriya house dinner and that night Inko told Izuku that Uncle Masaru was really unwell but he would be fine soon \u2013 the green teen had nodded, satisfied that Katsuki\u2019s behaviour had been explained.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>----</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki swore under his breath when he saw the common room was full of the so-called Deku squad and a few other members of class 1a.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat the f-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Okay who the fuck had just shushed him, red eyes swept the crowd before he met pink cheeks\u2019 stare. His eyes mirrored hers as they narrowed before dropping his voice into a harsh whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat. The. Fuck?\u201d Uraraka rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere's something wrong with Izuku, he seems\u2026sad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh well if that\u2019s all.\u201d Katsuki shoved his way through the common room to get to the kitchen. The blond plucked an apple from the fruit bowl before passing Izuku \u2013 who did seem, off? He was sat at the kitchen island staring at the countertop completely still with food left untouched in front of him. Katsuki knocked on the counter in front of him to get the nerd\u2019s attention before turning to face the green teen and chucking the apple at him, he turned back as Deku caught the apple to grab the popcorn and crisps he\u2019d come down for. Turning back to face Deku and their classmates, he was met with the apple being thrown back at him. Hmm, so Deku <em>was</em> fine, and actually know that he looked properly, he wasn\u2019t sat completely still, but rather was tapping part of the Fibonacci sequence out softly with his fingers \u2013 the teen was just sleep-deprived then and their classmates were idiots for thinking the teen was upset for some reason. Ugh. Katsuki rolled his eyes with a huff, raising his eyebrow at the boy sat in front of him, when a raised eyebrow answered his unspoken question he nodded his head at the reassurance that it was Deku's choice to stay up not nightmares or some other shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cMove extras.\u201d He forced his way back towards the stairs to get back to Hanta\u2019s dorm room to continue movie night.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Oh god damn it, he was so close to escaping as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing pink cheeks stay out of it\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Izuku is sad and you, you <em>threw</em> an\u00a0<em>apple</em> at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got his attention first\u201d Honestly, Katsuki rolled his eyes wondering how the hell some of their classmates thought they were going to make heroes with how unobservant they appeared at times.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hey, what's with the circle guys? Ah there you are Kats, c\u2019mon we\u2019re getting borrred\u201d Den had appeared in the stairway and was staring at the assembly of class 1a with badly hidden confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, these idiots thought Deku was fucking sad when he\u2019s just stupid for staying up so late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you know that bakugou-\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki interrupted Iida with a heavy sigh as he waved the apple in his face as an answer, struggling to contain his laugh when this only confused everyone even more. In their confused silence, he was quick to escape what had quickly turned into an interrogation, grabbing Den\u2019s hand and tugging them back up the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, what just happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRevelry in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou was humming. Which, Midoriya knew to their classmates, was not that weird. However, he knew the blond. He doubted Kacchan could even hear himself hum \u2013 he could hear fine, but a side effect of his quirk meant that sounds that come from himself, or his body were muffled to protect against the explosions he made \u2013 so it didn\u2019t make sense that the blond was seemingly making a self-soothing noise that he could hear. And it didn\u2019t matter. He knew that. No one other than him had noticed probably \u2013 why would they. The mysterious humming continued to not matter for a week until Midoriya was doing homework \u2013 or at least, he was meant to be doing his homework but he kept zoning out. After the fifth time he refocused, he realised with a jolt that he\u2019d spent the last 20 minutes humming to himself under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, oh fuuuck\u201d</p>\n<p>He thought that he was out of the childhood habit of copying the ash blond. But here he fucking was, humming just like Kacchan had started doing. He shook his head, and when he still felt the urge to hum to refocus, he clicked his tongue twice and put all his attention resolutely on his work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iz-Dek-<em>Izu</em> was really pissing him off. Over the past few months, they had slowly been working towards the friendship that they once shared. However. If the green teen kept clicking his fucking tongue, Katsuki is not going to be responsible for his actions. For Bakugou he was at the gym when <em>it</em> happened. He was stretching before he started his workout, and was humming to himself \u2013 he couldn\u2019t actually hear the humming, it was quiet even without his natural defences, but, the vibration it made in his throat worked to focus and calm him the same way humming did to everyone else. He felt his watch buzz against his wrist and began to move into the next stretch, clicking his tongue as he moved then repeated through his whole workout. Despite took him several workouts throughout the week going the same way as the first, it wasn\u2019t until he was helping Denki with their homework that he realised he had even picked up clicking. Although, in his defence, he couldn\u2019t hear it, only feel his tongue moving in his mouth. At least that was his excuse and he was sticking with it.</p>\n<p>Denki had asked for help on the maths homework, UA was in the middle of getting their exam and lesson requirements sorted, so their work was still on white paper, not their preferred light blue plus their dyscalculia was playing up bad. They took their English as well hoping that they could help Bakugou with translation if the other teen read it out for them. The two blonds had got through maths and had begun on English. Working separately until one needed the other when it happened.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Click.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hummmm.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Click.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Denki held in a sigh and looked over at Katsuki. The teen was flicking his pen around his fingers in deep concentration that Denki was loath to break but his attention was bad enough without Bakugou making random noises all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuuude, could you, like, not. <em>Please,</em> or at least tone it down a touch\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe clicking, y\u2019know the \u2018<em>click click</em>\u2019 noise Mido makes with his tongue, its distracting, the hummings okay I guess \u2013 soothing you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026The-the clicking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea- dude, you okay? Oh, oh, man you didn\u2019t know? Yeah, you were humming and every time you change tune you click your tongue like this <em>click</em>\u201d they looked over from blasty\u2019s bed to where the explosion user was sat at his desk to see the ash-blond had a slight pink hue to his usually pale cheeks. And suddenly it clicked. Golden eyes widened only to be mirrored by the crimson ones looking back at them. \u201cha, oh man haha you-your <em>still </em>copying your childhood BFF, aww Kacchan that\u2019s so cute\u201d they snorted at the look on their friend\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Den, do not tell the others, Jesus , shit I -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah bro don\u2019t stress, I don\u2019t even think the rest have realised that you two even <em>copied</em> each other let alone that you still do it\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah that\u2019s, um- they're all dumb extras what, ahem, what do they know huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I figured it out\" Denki couldn't help but poke at their friend, for once Bakugou was on the other side, they weren't about to let this opportunity pass them by.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah but you're not stupid, Pikachu\" or maybe they were....</p>\n<p>The electric quirk user took a good few seconds to commit flustered Bakugou Katsuki to their memory, \u201cHave you done number six? It\u2019s a tricky one, here let me see what you\u2019ve got yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s posture relaxed and his shoulders came down from his ears, as they lent over they knocked shoulders with their friend and shared a small smile before focusing on the work again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing really came of the humming and clicking incident, unlike other times, it seemed class 1a was unaware of the new, or rather old returning, developments to the childhood friends\u2019 friendship. But a few weeks later when Izuku was in the kitchen making himself lunch and humming to himself under his breath, it was Katsuki who brought it up. or rather, brought it up in his own way.</p>\n<p>Izuku startled at the chuckle, whipping around to face the blond.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like old habits die hard huh Z<em>ukie</em>?\u201d the blond clicked his tongue to emphasise his softly spoken question.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh, yeah guess so <em>K</em><em>acchan</em>\u201d the blond padded forwards, bumping his hip against the green-haired teen, his eye soft with an old friendship and a layer of regret and guilt. Izuku hummed under his breath again, smiling as he knocked his hip back against the red-eyed teen, \u201cI'm glad though, our parents always said we made cute friends\u201d - things had been good between the two, and honestly Izuku wanted the friendship that they used to have and if he needed to give the blond a push then he would. Even if part of him was scared at losing what they had now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah we did, but we\u2019re <u>kickass</u> <em>now</em>, got it?\u201d</p>"
