  "summary": "<p>\n<em>He thought about the way Harry looked at him, smiled at him; about the way Draco\u2019s head was nearly always full of him, all day every day, and about the way Draco sometimes deliberately went to bed still smelling of him, refusing to acknowledge what it meant \u2013 because he already fucking knew what it meant. What all of it meant.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And then Draco decided, fuck it, he was going to risk it.

  "notes": "<p>Nearly a week late \u2013 oh, the shame! The struggle to complete this little one-shot has been <em>real</em>. But my undying love for Bottom Draco, Draco\u2019s bottom and Draco in general, kept me at it. So here it is, this steaming pile of... fluff! Or may I say smuff?! Ugh, not now, you idiot.</p>\n<p>So anyway, the lovely prompt by <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/Mir_miao/pseuds/Mir_miao\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mira Rhaine</a> that I claimed was:<br>\"Harry's been wanting to make their relationship public, and what better to time to make it when there's a quidditch match that falls on Draco's birthday? Additional info: hmm, the slytherin's not playing against Griffindor, so Draco is in the stands cheering for harry secretly. Draco lets harry take the reins on when do they make public.\"</p>\n<p>I jumped at this because I\u2019ve wanted to write something along these lines <em>forever</em>. So here\u2019s my humble offering for this gorgeous fest that is basically the best thing to happen to me all year.

  "text": "<p>Draco automatically slowed when he neared the little coterie gathered at the wide window seat. It was the usual bunch of Gryffindors with Lovegood's fair head\u00a0standing out as the single Ravenclaw \u2013 but Draco\u2019s eyes remained on the one person who stood out like only he could.</p>\n<p>Potter didn\u2019t sit lounging across the length of the stone sill like one would\u2019ve expected him to; it was Weasley who lay across it with his head on Granger\u2019s lap, who in turn had her nose characteristically buried in a thick volume. Potter stood next to her her, hip leaning against the sill, and he was laughing at something Longbottom and Lovegood were doing \u2013 some weird dance move, Draco didn\u2019t pause to take note. He had other things, other people, to take note of \u2013 namely Potter.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s gaze slowly travelled upwards, starting at the worn trainers, laces coming undone on the right one; the flap of a shirttail hanging out, crimson Gryffindor tie spilling out of one trouser pocket. Potter\u2019s sleeves were rolled back haphazardly up to his elbows, thick forearms crossed across his chest, the first two buttons on his white shirt left undone. The mangy black head was thrown back in mirth, the unkempt mass of ebony making Draco\u2019s hands itch with the desire to be buried in it. Light stubble shadowed the rugged jaw line; Draco could almost feel it on his skin already, scratching across him in a not entirely unpleasant way \u2013 not that he\u2019d ever <em>admit</em> it. The soft, chapped lower lip was now being bitten in a thoughtful manner and when Draco\u2019s gaze finally landed on the piercing green eyes, he realised why.</p>\n<p>His stomach clenched in a mixture of excitement and embarrassment when he realised that not only had he been caught staring but was being thoroughly scrutinised himself. His pace, having had slowed down slightly, immediately went back up and he remembered to keep his chin raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused. Turned. Lifted a brow in a well-practised expression of patient disdain.</p>\n<p>It was Weasley who\u2019d called out to him. \u201cWeasley.\u201d Draco nodded stiffly. The redhead laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to lose again tonight?\u201d he asked cheerfully. \u201cI bet I can beat you in eight moves or less.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was taking a considerable amount of physical effort to stop himself meeting Potter\u2019s gaze, now fixed so firmly on him that he could feel himself starting to sweat a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d enjoy more than taking you down, you overconfident ginger git.\u201d Draco smirked as Weasley\u2019s sister sang a low <em>oooohhhhh</em> from between cupped hands and Granger shook her head without looking up, mouth curled into an exasperated smile. Longbottom made a soft <em>pft</em> as he leaned back against the wall, hands in his pockets, and Lovegood suddenly pranced over to plant a very wet kiss on Draco\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>Draco blinked, secretly horrified that he was now actually <em>used</em> to these people and their idiosyncrasies, wiping his cheek and ignoring the delighted laughter from the rest of them. He returned Lovegood\u2019s bright smile with a rather watery one of his own. \u201cHello, Lovegood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d she said brightly. And then, \u201cYou have been highly sexually active lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley actually rolled off the windowsill, though unfortunately instead of rolling outwards and falling down six floors, he landed on the corridor floor on all fours, heaving with soundless laughter. Longbottom was grinning widely as the she-Weasel hooted in the most unladylike manner. Even Granger had looked up from her book to purse her lips at Lovegood, brown eyes dancing with amusement as she then glanced at Draco.</p>\n<p>When he finally caved and let his gaze lock with Potter\u2019s, he regretted it instantly. Potter was watching him, his gaze soft and dark, his mouth curved in a loose, terribly distracting smile that could only be described as <em>adoring</em>. Draco\u2019s stomach fluttered and he could feel heat flooding his cheeks as he prepared to walk away, gulping hard and refusing to acknowledge the fond twinkle in those damn green eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, alright, as charming as this has been.\u201d Draco made to turn away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never confirmed whether she\u2019s right, though.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Now</em> Potter chose to chime in. <em>Arse</em>hole.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Draco said, facing Potter properly. The bastard hit him with a full blown grin, mischievous and aggravatingly attractive, and Draco wanted so bad to reciprocate. \u201cBecause it really isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s business but my own, is it, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter shrugged exaggeratedly. \u201cYours and whomever it is you\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d He paused, licking his lips over his smile and giving Draco the mere shadow of a wink, \u201c\u2014sexually active with.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was sure he was properly blushing now. And he was trembling very lightly from a mixture of genuine mortification and...</p>\n<p>Exhilaration.</p>\n<p>Twisting his face into the best sneer he could muster, given the circumstances, Draco calmly flipped him off, making Potter burst out into a delighted chuckle, and then turned around and walked away determinedly, grinning foolishly to himself once he was a safe distance away.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Barely half a minute after he\u2019d let himself into the alcove behind the tapestry with the angry centaurs on it, Harry was on him.</p>\n<p>His startled gasp morphed into breathless sniggering as he accepted Harry\u2019s vigorous flurry of moist kisses that were being pressed all over his face. Sturdy hands clenched at his hips and he was backed firmly into the wall as warm lips caught on his forehead, his eyelids, the tip of his nose, the corners of his mouth and his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remind me of Hagrid\u2019s slobbering beast of a dog,\u201d Draco laughed, attempting to bat him away before cupping his cheeks and kissing him back instead. Playing along, Harry painted a firm lick up his cheek and Draco yelped, still laughing as he planted both his hands on Harry\u2019s face and forced it away. \u201cUgh, you\u2019re fucking gr--\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry cut him off by catching his mouth, mid-sentence, in his. Humming contently, he immediately kissed back, pushing his hands into that messy mane and gripping, clutching tight, just like he\u2019d so desperately wanted to a few minutes ago.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hands on his hips tightened and he ran a careful tongue along Draco\u2019s own, the velvety slide making them both shiver. Tilting his head to further deepen the kiss, Draco made a sound of irritation when Harry abruptly pulled away.</p>\n<p>They panted softly at each other, Draco frowning, angling forward for more, and Harry pulling back gently with a small smile that clearly indicated that he had something on his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. The git always found the most inopportune moments to <em>talk</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Harry laughed softly. And then quite out of nowhere, \u201cI wanted to kiss you back there in front of everybody like I\u2019ve wanted nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could kiss me now,\u201d said Draco pointedly, cocking one brow and resolutely ignoring the swarm of maniacal butterflies that burst to life in his belly at Harry\u2019s words. The hope and honesty in the other boy\u2019s voice made Draco want to <em>scream</em> into a void.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could,\u201d Harry agreed, leaning forward and planting a disgustingly sweet kiss on his mouth before pulling away once more. \u201cI want to meet your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco spluttered quite vigorously and was certain that he\u2019d unintentionally spat on Harry. \u201cWhat? Why?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned on a sigh. \u201cWell, if <em>my</em> mum were alive, I\u2019d have liked to introduce my boyfriend to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heart clenching, Draco grabbed his head and kissed him fervently before he realised Harry was trying (and failing) not to laugh. Then he shoved him back roughly and scowled. \u201cThat was a shit thing to say,\u201d he informed him. \u201cWhy d\u2019you want to meet Mother anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cBecause it\u2019s the proper thing to do, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProper?\u201d Draco intoned incredulously. \u201c<em>Proper?!</em> You eat every meal with your elbows on the table. You rock back in every chair you sit. <em>You don\u2019t own a comb.</em> You do not get to talk about what is <em>proper</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clicking his tongue irritably at Harry\u2019s amused chuckling, Draco yanked him forward by the collar to snog him some more. Harry responded at once, curling his arms around Draco and holding him tight enough that his ribs protested, their mouths moving furiously together, wet and noisy. Draco began a gentle rut, grinding his stirring cock against Harry\u2019s groin until there was a soft moan in response and one hand came down to roughly squeeze Draco\u2019s right arse cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d Harry broke away all of a sudden and Draco let his forehead thump onto his shoulder with a tired sigh, reaching back to close his hand over the one Harry had on his arse, holding it firmly in place as he pressed back into it. \u201cI want people to know... you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Draco refused to meet his gaze, instead pressing biting kisses along the stubbled jaw.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s grip tightened around his handful of his bum and Draco muffled a squeal. \u201cAbout us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sighed again. \u201cHarry, we\u2019ve been over this\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> didn\u2019t want to tell anyone in case it somehow affected our N.E.W.T preparations.\u201d Harry frowned at him as Draco moved back to look at him steadily. \u201cWell? We\u2019re done with our N.E.W.Ts now,\u201d he said pointedly while running his thumb over Draco\u2019s still-wet lower lip.</p>\n<p>Draco opened his mouth and neatly sucked his thumb in, closing his lips around it and deliberately moving his mouth along the digit in a way that was transparently suggestive. Harry\u2019s breath shuddered out of him as he watched, transfixed, as Draco lapped at his finger, nibbling at the square corners of his nail before sucking the length back into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry groaned, and it was with no small amount of satisfaction that Draco let himself be snogged breathless for the next several minutes, winding long arms around his neck and keeping him in place this time, kissing him back hungrily and guiding Harry\u2019s hands down to his arse once more.</p>\n<p>When he felt Harry trying to pull away yet again, he growled and brought his teeth down over his lower lip, letting his displeasure be known by biting repeatedly until Harry let out a little snarl and deepened the kiss with a vengeance, sucking on his lips and licking around inside his mouth until Draco was forced to pull back with a long, desperate gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our last week at Hogwarts,\u201d Harry panted.</p>\n<p>Draco made an impatient sound through his own laboured breathing. \u201cAnd what? You want to ensure everybody knows about us before we leave? Hold my hand in the corridors? Snog me at breakfast? Undress me and fuck me in front of everyone during dinner? Oh, shut up!\u201d he said irritably as Harry\u2019s grin grew filthy and he squeezed Draco\u2019s arse as if in approval of Draco\u2019s suggestion. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked on a sigh, combing the wild black fringe off Harry\u2019s forehead and gently flicking the pad of his thumb over his scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>are</em> with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least tell me why you don\u2019t want people to know! We haven\u2019t even told our <em>friends</em> about us yet. And I\u2019m pretty darn sure they already fucking know. Parkinson <em>winked</em> at me the other day when we got back from the Prefects\u2019 Bath \u2013 I waited fifteen minutes before I followed you into the common room! But I think she still fucking <em>knew</em>.\u201d He suddenly looked thoughtful. \u201cAnd if <em>she\u2019s</em> been able to guess, then it means Hermione\u2019s probably already known for a lot longer, and <em>that</em> means that Ron as good as knows too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed into slits. \u201cWhat did you tell all of them when you came after me just now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr... That I had to use the loo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they believed you?\u201d Draco\u2019s asked scathingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wait around to check.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s lip curled. \u201cI really hate you sometimes, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wound his fingers in the soft hair at the nape of Draco\u2019s neck, gently tugging until his throat was bared and his breath was audibly hitched. \u201cReally?\u201d He brushed his lips over Draco\u2019s \u2013 once, twice; barely-there touches that made him whine and pull against Harry\u2019s grip on his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off. And kiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pressed their foreheads together, and for a while, they just stood like that. Draco brought his hands up to cradle Harry\u2019s face, grazing the tip of his nose over his and following it up with a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how people will react,\u201d Draco admitted quietly into the silence. \u201cI can\u2019t know for sure that the news will be received well and I can\u2019t risk--\u201d He stopped talking abruptly and leaned back, rolling his eyes in a way he hoped made him seem unconcerned. \u201cWhatever, Potter. Can we drop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t risk...what?\u201d Harry prompted hopefully.</p>\n<p>Draco shot him a glare before suddenly straightening up and reaching out to hitch the tapestry out of the way. \u201cFine. Since you don\u2019t seem to be in the mood to fuck anyway--\u201d</p>\n<p>Next thing he knew, he\u2019d been whirled around and pressed face first into the wall with his arm bent at the elbow, wrist being held in an unbreakable grip at his lower back. \u201cI\u2019m always in the mood to fuck you.\u201d Harry closed his teeth around one earlobe and pulled gently, nipping at it as he released it.</p>\n<p>Draco stood there wordlessly, shivering as the wet, hot mouth worked expertly over each of the sensitive little nooks along his neck, the light stubble catching on his skin, adding an edge to the softly sucked kisses. His tie was tugged loose and pulled off over his head and his collar was yanked aside for more access to his throat. When Harry bit firmly into the curve between neck and shoulder, Draco whined softly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d learnt many things about Harry Potter in the seven months they\u2019d been... \u2018together\u2019 \u2013 things he hadn\u2019t picked up during the seven years spent antagonising him.</p>\n<p>Harry Potter was exasperatingly impatient and had little regard for finely tailored clothing \u2013 Draco now knew several of the school house-elves by name simply because of the innumerable times he\u2019d had to seek one of them out to request them to sew the buttons on his shirt back on. And so when his shirt was carelessly jerked open and he heard what sounded like at least two buttons pinging across the flagstones, Draco just <em>tch</em>ed lightly, knowing there was absolutely <em>no point</em> complaining out loud.</p>\n<p>And for all the generosity of spirit that people associated him with, Harry Potter was a possessive bastard \u2013 and was utter shit at pretending otherwise. This one time Draco had sat next to a particularly handsome seventh year Slytherin during dinner (because, yes, Harry and he had had a fight that evening and Draco was nothing if not hurtfully petty), Harry had more than satisfied Draco\u2019s passive aggressive need to see him completely <em>lose his shit</em> (Harry had fucked him so hard that night, Draco was fairly certain he was still bruised from it). And so when Harry gnawed a proprietary line of mottled red marks starting below his ear all the way down to his shoulder, Draco pushed a hand into the raven hair and bit his lip over a weak moan, because fuck, but Harry\u2019s unabashed displays of possessiveness drove him into a frenzy like nothing else did.</p>\n<p>Harry was also infuriatingly tenacious, impressively witty, and was also funny with a sassy sort of confidence that left a person momentarily speechless before they laughed. He was consistently, <em>overtly</em> kind in a way that left Draco gritting his teeth at the warmth in his chest, and was unwaveringly, unflinchingly loyal.</p>\n<p>He was also not a believer in the artful concealment of one\u2019s true feelings and intentions. The way he spoke to, looked at, touched and kissed Draco left absolutely no doubt in his mind about how Harry felt about him \u2013 and frankly speaking, that as well as the realisation that he himself likely felt the same way about Harry in return terrified Draco like few other things did.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, fuck.\u201d Draco let his head drop back onto Harry\u2019s shoulder as his cock was pulled out and lovingly fondled, pushing his damp hardness into his fist and whining again when the grip tightened obligingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there,\u201d Harry said, fondly amused. Draco\u2019s belt buckle clanged loudly as it hit the floor, the elastic of his pants snapping loudly against his skin as Harry dragged it down the curve of his buttocks and down past his thighs.</p>\n<p>Draco only realised that Harry had knelt when his left arse cheek was unexpectedly bitten \u2013 hard. \u201c<em>Argh!</em> I\u2019ll hex your teeth into marshmallows!\u201d Draco threatened, even as arousal spread outwards from the sting that Harry was now lovingly easing away with his tongue, chuckling at Draco\u2019s outburst. \u201cPlease,\u201d he added, shivering as hot breath puffed over his crack.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Draco\u2019s elbows were being tugged at, prompting him to drop his arms and let Harry take his hands, guiding them behind himself. Face heating immediately, Draco slowly gripped and parted himself for Harry\u2019s perusal, because Harry Potter was also shockingly filthy and it was probably one of his top three traits, in Draco\u2019s top-secret opinion.</p>\n<p>Pressing his lips tightly over his teeth to prevent any pathetic, premature sounds slipping out, Draco leaned his forehead into the cool stone and waited. He could feel Harry\u2019s breath on his hole now and Harry\u2019s fingers on the backs of his thighs, calloused and wonderfully warm, stroking him in slow, unhurried caresses.</p>\n<p>When the first lick came, Draco jerked purely out of surprise. Then he planted his feet more firmly, toes curing inside his shoes, and shamelessly pushed his hips back out. There was a low chuckle \u2013 and then Harry planted his face in Draco\u2019s crack with the air of a man settling down for a much looked-forward-to feast.</p>\n<p>Draco eyes slammed shut as a little yip of pleasure sounded in his throat, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallowed hurriedly. Harry painted wide, wet strokes over his hole, pressing the flat of his tongue <em>hard</em> against it, his scratchy jaw instantly inflaming the sensitive skin along the insides of his arse cheeks. Draco could feel the way Harry\u2019s whole torso moved with him, with the way he was throwing himself into eating Draco out, with every last iota of his nearly boundless energy. He didn\u2019t bother easing his tongue in by fractions, instead simply forcing the wiggling muscle through the stubbornly tight ring of Draco\u2019s arsehole until he\u2019d breached him completely.</p>\n<p><em>Now</em> Draco moaned \u2013 he really couldn\u2019t help it and nor could he be blamed for it \u2013 and rutted his sadly bobbing cock into thin air. Harry ate him with the same relentless tenacity with which he worked to put asunder Dark Lords; as if his sole purpose was to reduce Draco to a babbling mess as he was wracked with increasingly violent shudders that made his skin burn red hot and his cock leak a small spurt of pre-come, the skin along his crack reddened from that rough stubble.</p>\n<p>Over and over Harry stabbed that tongue in and out of him, easing up a little only when he deemed Draco\u2019s arsehole sufficiently pliant, after which he closed his lips over it and started to suck, noisily and with an embarrassing lack of shame.</p>\n<p>Harry then made a little <em>tut</em> of disapproval. \u201c<em>Open</em>,\u201d he ordered gently and Draco, now perspiring all the way down to the small of his back, realised that although his grip on his own bum was painfully tight, his arms were limp and his arse wasn\u2019t as wide open as Harry liked it to be. \u201cHere.\u201d He eased Draco\u2019s hands away at the little whimper that escaped him, grabbed him and opened him up mortifyingly wide, pushing his face back in with an eager growl.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like an animal,\u201d Draco said, talking over the devastated little cry that he\u2019d nearly let out. \u201cOnly animals eat arse with this sort of unapologetic enthusiasm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you complaining?\u201d Harry asked mildly before running the very tip of his tongue in a lazy circle along the inside of his rim. Draco <em>shook</em>, pushing his arse back onto that tongue and then bucking forward so his cock slid against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d And then, when Harry blew lightly over his sopping wet hole, \u201c<em>Please</em>, you bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughing, Harry turned him around and immediately nuzzled his cock, guiding it into his mouth with his left hand while his right slipped in between Draco\u2019s legs. Grabbing him by two handfuls of his hair, Draco drove his cock into that wet warmth, panting through his mouth and groaning roughly when Harry pressed two fingertips into the yielding softness of his stretched hole. Draco\u2019s stomach pooled with the kind of dull but terribly fierce heat that steadily spread outwards until his hips and groin and back all <em>ached</em> with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Draco let out a startled yelp as a hand suddenly closed around his ankle and lifted his shoe-clad foot onto one sturdy shoulder. \u201cMerlin, warn me, dammit.\u201d He whined in disappointment when his cock was abandoned rudely, Harry moving down to catch Draco\u2019s balls in his mouth for a quick suckle before he moved his mouth lower, so he could nibble\u00a0at his arsehole again. \u201cI was <em>close</em>, you tit!\u201d Draco groaned, trembling as the hot, damp skin of his back was plastered against the cold stone of the wall where his shirt rode up.</p>\n<p>Harry ignored his grumbling, pushing his tongue back inside him along with the two fingers in a slick, wildly arousing tangle. The fingers went straight for his prostate, no dilly dallying, and waged a direct assault on it, massaging and squeezing until Draco was sure he was going to pass the fuck out. He was moaning hoarsely now, his eyes rolling back into his head, and simply focused on staying upright and leaving some of Harry\u2019s hair attached to his scalp.</p>\n<p>He knew the exact moment Harry conjured lube into the whole mix; he felt the sudden coolness of it, and then Harry finally pulled his tongue out, added another finger to replace it and scissored them all at once. Draco thrashed as much as he deemed prudent for a person standing balanced on one leg, and at that point, Harry looked up.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s breath hitched, and he gazed back down through half-lidded, pleasure-glazed eyes, releasing his hair to stroke the backs of his long, nimble fingers down Harry\u2019s face instead. His glasses were slightly lopsided, side-effect of being an excellent rimmer while also half blind without corrective lenses. But his eyes <em>shone</em> up at Draco, vivid green and intensely bright as he stared with that half smile he reserved just for him.</p>\n<p>And Draco\u2019s knee buckled. He collapsed with a gasp of shock, arms flailing wildly, but Harry caught him, fingers pulling out of him and both hands firmly grabbing on to the cushiony softness of Draco\u2019s bum, giving it a teasing squeeze as he positioned\u00a0him to straddle his thighs, pants and trousers still tangled around his ankles before Harry pulled off one shoe and then tugged that leg free from the constricting garments so Draco could spread his knees open wider.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t your knees sore?\u201d Draco murmured softly, reaching up to straighten the black, square framed spectacles and pressing a quick kiss to the jagged scar under the messy fringe.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so what if they are,\u201d Harry brushed aside huskily, releasing Draco\u2019s arse to reach between them and unfasten his trousers, finally releasing his own flushed thickness, damp and streaming with slick. Draco moaned and closed his hand over Harry\u2019s, stroking him in quick, practised movements that had Harry tossing his head back.</p>\n<p>Draco attacked his throat at once, leaving his own set of marks on the sun-bronzed skin, smiling against the jutting collarbones as Harry let out gritted grunts of pleasure into his mussed blond hair, jerking as Draco cupped his balls, rolling them in his hand before giving them a little squeeze--</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, <em>stop</em>, come here,\u201d Harry panted, knocking away his hand and hefting Draco up with one arm crooked beneath his arse, using his other hand to guide his cock into place.</p>\n<p>They moaned into each other\u2019s mouths as Draco sunk, not very carefully, onto Harry\u2019s cock. The shaft pulsed and throbbed inside him, the burn of accommodation making Draco go cross eyed. \u201cWait!\u201d Draco gasped as Harry lifted him back up so only the head was inside; but before Harry could scrabble to obey, to hold him firmly in place, Draco was already sliding down once more, gravity and his own weight dragging him into place around Harry\u2019s cock, which then slid snidely over Draco\u2019s prostate in a flash of near blinding pleasure. Draco thrashed. \u201c<em>Oh fuck!</em> Okay, <em>don\u2019t</em> wait, do that again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Harry laughed breathlessly into his neck, grabbing Draco\u2019s waist and using a bruising grip to hoist Draco in a steady rise and fall, grinding his cock up into him with deep, wilful thrusts.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s effortless displays of sheer physical strength during sex left Draco, each and every time without fail, breathless and wildly aroused. He\u2019d been on edge for several minutes already and now, with Harry inside him, <em>around</em> him, lifting and hauling him as he pleased, growling\u00a0filth into his ear \u2013 Draco realised through the red haze that clouded his vision that he\u2019d long since lost his mind.</p>\n<p>He leaned back until his shoulders rested against the wall, instinctively tightening his thighs around Harry\u2019s hips in a grip that was probably far from comfortable for him. But Harry simply pinned him with that steady, scorching green gaze and fucked up into him with enough force to leave Draco gasping for air. His cock slapped against his belly, neglected by both of them, and Draco couldn\u2019t even bring himself to reach for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou going to come for me?\u201d Harry murmured, thumbs tracing Draco\u2019s hipbones as he dipped down to run the flat of his tongue over the length of one of the scars across Draco\u2019s chest. His cock was pressed ruthlessly against Draco\u2019s prostate and when Harry shifted his head to bite down over one tight, pink nipple, Draco shuddered all over, crying out helplessly.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t relent, sucking on the hard nub until it was reddened and shiny with spit before flicking his tongue over it in swift, teasing strokes that had Draco keening and yanking on his hair again. Over and over those teeth scraped at his nipple, leaving it delightfully sore and perversely throbbing for more of the same treatment. And Harry obliged, loudly sucking on it until Draco\u2019s spine bent inwards and he unravelled completely.</p>\n<p>His orgasm hit with the same jarring force it always did when Harry fucked him. Completely overwhelmed and simply shocked into silence, Draco came with sharp, upward bucks, ropes of come flying onto the flat of his belly and chest, Harry now thrusting wildly, head thrown back and jaw clenched.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d he breathed, his grip on Draco turning savage as he stiffened and let out a guttural cry, pressing Draco onto his cock as if determined to come as deep inside him as physically possible. Whimpering, Draco pushed off the wall and wrapped both arms around Harry, clutching him to himself and pressing hot kisses onto his face which was still frozen in that rapturous mien of completion. \u201cDraco,\u201d he whispered again, and then Draco kissed him.</p>\n<p>Despite being\u00a0far from comfortable in the way they were sat tangled together on the cold, hard flagstones, but neither seemed to care as they kissed in frenzied desperation. Hands grabbed at hair and clothes as they clung onto each other in a sudden, embarrassing burst of emotion that neither wanted to formally acknowledge.</p>\n<p>They were both fighting for breath by the time they pulled apart with a wet smack of swollen lips, and Draco waded through the slight dizziness to whisper, \u201cRisk this.\u201d He rested their brows together and pressed his hand flat over Harry\u2019s chest, right over his heart which he could feel thundering under his touch. \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk losing this.\u201d His voice shook and for once, he didn\u2019t give a fuck. \u201cI <em>can\u2019t</em> risk losing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was silent, his arms tightly wound around Draco\u2019s trembling form. \u201cMalfoy.\u201d A little confused by the sudden reversion to his family name, Draco leaned back to peer into the bespectacled face that shone seriously at him. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose this.\u201d Harry paused. \u201cEver.\u201d Draco licked his lips slowly, shutting his eyes against the glare of the fierce promise in that declaration. \u201cDraco...\u201d Harry kissed his name onto his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy back is killing me,\u201d said Draco drily, quirking a crooked smile at the other boy before struggling off his lap (and cock). He slid off his thighs, landing on his bum with a grunt, hissing at the blunt pressure against his puffy hole, his arse deliciously sore.</p>\n<p>Harry leaned back onto his hands and stretched his legs out alongside Draco with a broken groan of pain. Ignoring his near complete nudity for a few more seconds, Draco reached out and gave one of Harry\u2019s ankles an empathetic squeeze. Harry sighed, smiling lazily as\u00a0Draco got stiffly to his feet and pulled his clothes back into place, muttering under his breath as he Summoned first his tie, and then the buttons he\u2019d once again lost, applying a Sticking Charm to fix them back onto his shirt \u2013 these charms never lasted long; he\u2019d have to make another trip to the kitchens. Or maybe he\u2019d just teach himself to sew. He might as well; it\u2019s not as if Harry would ever <em>not</em> wrench his shirt open like a Neanderthal.</p>\n<p>Harry, lounging against the wall, only had his fly hanging open, pink cock nestled soft and thick amidst the damp black curls. He watched Draco with the faintly heated gaze of a person still seeped in post-orgasmic lassitude and when Draco held out a hand meant to help him up, Harry grabbed it and nuzzled his face into the soft palm.</p>\n<p>Clicking his tongue with the indulgent patience of familiarity, Draco let him press dry kisses into his hand before combing some of the hair out of his face. Cupping his cheek, he murmured a soft, \u201cGet up, you stupid lump,\u201d and tugged firmly as this time, Harry accepted his hand and hauled himself up to his feet.</p>\n<p>He watched as Harry eased himself back in and did up his fly, leaving his shirt un-tucked. Draco made another sound of disapproval as, to add to his general unkempt appearance, Harry raised both hands and gave his hair a vigorous, completely unnecessary ruffle.</p>\n<p>Grinning at Draco\u2019s haughty sneer, Harry gathered him up in a sudden tackle and kissed him deeply. Simultaneously attempting to pat his hair into place, Draco kissed him back with a low hum, pushing his tongue in under Harry\u2019s and gently nibbling on his lower lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Finals tomorrow,\u201d Harry pulled away and panted out of the blue. Draco blinked slowly, wet lips parted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Draco said tightly, sulky displeasure clear in his voice; he scowled at the teasing grin he got for that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s also your birthday, you prat.\u201d Harry laughed softly, burying his face in Draco\u2019s neck. \u201cI remember. I\u2019ll catch the Snitch for you, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse <em>you</em>, but I expect a quality present, Potter,\u201d Draco said, sniffing snootily before immediately ruining the effect by planting a wet kiss on Harry\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I just gave you your quality present.\u201d Harry laughed again as Draco smacked him up the head. \u201cHey, extended rim jobs are perfectly acceptable presents, you spoilt brat. Learn to appreciate the sm-- Ouch!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The stands heaved, as if overcome by the breathtaking energy of the thronging students. The players shot through the air in streaks of cobalt blue and rich crimson, the Quaffle switching hands with electrifying speed, Beater bats smashing into Bludgers with enough force to send them rocketing around dangerously, each player\u2019s face indecipherable from the other.</p>\n<p>Except for Harry\u2019s of course.</p>\n<p>Draco sat between Pansy and Granger, his eyes fixed on the thumb sized, scarlet shape on the far end of the pitch, high enough that Draco knew Harry wouldn\u2019t be able to spot <em>him</em> in the crowd even if he tried to, but could probably take in the entirety of the pitch from that excellent vantage.</p>\n<p>His heart thundering in his ears, he ignored the roar from the Ravenclaw supporters as they scored another ten points. In retaliation, one of the Gyffindor Beaters sent a Bludger hurtling in the direction of the Chaser who\u2019d just scored, who was then saved from a broken face by an astonishingly quick Ravenclaw Beater. The teams were almost neck and neck, Gryffindor at a hundred and thirty, Ravenclaw leading by ten points at a hundred and forty.</p>\n<p>\u201cWRAP THIS UP, HARRY!\u201d Weasley bellowed from next to Granger. He was on his feet, like a majority of the students were, and was bouncing up and down with pent up tension. \u201cCOME <em>ON</em>, YOU FUCKING <em>KNOB-HEAD!</em>\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cRon, please <em>shut up</em>,\u201d Granger said tetchily, but Draco could see the way her knuckles had turned white from gripping the railing in front of them, anxiety pouring off her in waves.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Weasley, kindly spare us your aggravating <em>cheerleading.</em>\u201d Draco\u2019s voice was cracked with nervousness but he covered it up by rudely flipping Weasley the bird when he turned around to scowl at Draco.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d not had the chance to wish Harry luck that morning before breakfast like he\u2019d hoped to. He\u2019d overslept like a fucking arsehole, before being jolted awake to Pansy\u2019s shrieked <em>happy birthday, you great big ponce</em>, and had then spent half an hour opening presents with her while still half asleep.</p>\n<p>It was only after she\u2019d wandered away asking him to hurry up and move his fat bum \u2013 the fucking bitch, Draco\u2019s arse was his <em>pride </em>(and also Harry\u2019s pride, he supposed) \u2013 that he\u2019d spotted one more gift, half-hidden under the folds of his bedcovers. Wrapped in delicate silver paper with little silver Snitches on it, Draco had lifted the lid of the nondescript black box to discover \u2013 a Snitch.</p>\n<p>Unlike a real gold Snitch this one was silver, and had tiny wings, also silver, that didn\u2019t flutter. Inside the shiny, spherical ball, he\u2019d found the cufflinks he\u2019d pointed out to Pansy one evening, several weeks ago, as they\u2019d flipped through that month\u2019s copy of Wizarding Elite in the Eighth Year Common Room. Harry had sauntered past with a derisively snorted <em>cufflinks, honestly</em>, and Draco had chucked an empty Chocolate Frog carton at him with a stilted snarl before creeping out to an empty broom cupboard with him ten minutes later and sucking his cock till he\u2019d come down Draco\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>The cufflinks were gold and in the shape of a sinuously wound snake, jaws stretched wide, tiny fangs, also gold, gleaming on either side of the emerald in its mouth. Its eyes, small pinpricks, were also studded emeralds. They\u2019d mainly caught Draco\u2019s fancy because the model who\u2019d been wearing them in the picture had been rather good looking and had winked saucily at Draco. And it was just like Harry to have fucking remembered and bought them for him anyway, despite the fact that they were actual <em>gold</em> and <em>emeralds</em> and probably cost a fortune.</p>\n<p>Underneath them, he\u2019d found a note and had unfolded it to read, \u2018<em>No other bloke our age would ever wear cufflinks, you posh git, but if anyone can carry these off, it\u2019s you. Happy birthday!</em>\u2019 scribbled across it in Harry\u2019s barely legible scrawl.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d shot out of bed and had raced through his morning ablutions with the soppiest fucking grin on his face and the desire to kiss his idiot boyfriend throbbing through him. But by the time he\u2019d gone up to the Great Hall, the Gryffindor team had already left for their warm-ups.</p>\n<p>So now, nearly two hours later, Draco was practically bursting with the need to just <em>be</em> with Harry. The fact that Harry flew with a weightless grace and a nearly impertinent ease made it so much worse \u2013 he was fucking <em>majestic</em> up there, his posture perfect, his balance impeccable \u2013 Draco could barely keep it together.</p>\n<p>He fucking hated the Ravenclaw team with a vengeance, having personally lost to them the previous month but he couldn\u2019t for the life of him bring himself to openly cheer on the Gryffindors, and so he simply sat there, spine stiff as a board, expression carefully arranged into bored impassivity, and unblinkingly watched Harry as he flew lazy circles over the pitch.</p>\n<p>Until, suddenly, the indolently hovering figure Draco\u2019s gaze was fixed on moved so quickly that for one discombobulated moment, Draco thought he\u2019d simply vanished into thin air. Harry flattened himself on his broom and plunged into such a steep nosedive that Draco\u2019s stomach lurched just watching. Pansy gasped and Granger let out a soft shriek as Weasley, and the rest of the fucking school, hollered so loudly that the Forest beyond the pitch seemed to wilt from the noise.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of students seemingly held their breath as Harry Potter hurtled towards the freshly mown grass, the Ravenclaw Seeker\u2019s panic palpable as he followed far, far too slowly.</p>\n<p>And then Harry was shooting back up, hand held aloft in triumph, the feeble fluttering of the gossamer white wings just about visible against his gloved knuckles.</p>\n<p>The stands exploded.</p>\n<p>Weasley was bellowing with both arms up in the air, eyes popping and the tendons in his neck bulging. Granger was crying and laughing all at once, and was, shockingly, tangled in a completely spontaneous hug with Pansy. Applause thundered, Charmed lion-hats roared and students shrieked with the same joy that Draco, horrifyingly enough, felt in his own chest.</p>\n<p>He was on his feet \u2013 when had got to his feet? \u2013 and Harry... wait, Harry was looking at him; was <em>flying</em> at him.</p>\n<p>Grinning that open-hearted beam that Draco privately swooned over, Harry was making a beeline for him, speeding in a maroon blur. Draco only then realised that he himself was grinning right back. As Harry drew nearer, it suddenly became crystal clear just what he was about to do.</p>\n<p>Out of <em>nowhere</em>, Draco suddenly thought back to their first kiss \u2013 hesitant, clumsy, and laced with Firewhiskey as they\u2019d lounged by the fireplace in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed. He thought of the kiss after their \u2018first fight\u2019 \u2013 Draco had screamed at Harry about how he probably still thought of Draco as nothing but a Death Eater who\u2019d gone scot-free; it had been a completely irrational bout of insecurity and Harry\u2019s eyes had been wet as they\u2019d later kissed with a nearly violent need to reassure, shivering in the cold as they\u2019d stood pressed together in the snow behind one of the greenhouses.</p>\n<p>He thought of their kiss just the previous evening, the one after which Harry had said those things about... them, the promise ringing clear in his tone.</p>\n<p>He thought about the way Harry looked at him, <em>smiled</em> at him; about the way Draco\u2019s head was nearly always full of him, all day every day, and about the way Draco sometimes deliberately went to bed still smelling of him, refusing to acknowledge what it meant \u2013 because he already fucking <em>knew</em> what it meant. What <em>all</em> of it meant.</p>\n<p>And then Draco decided, fuck it, he was going to risk it. <em>They</em> were going to risk it together, Harry and Draco.</p>\n<p>For then Harry descended on him, one arm winding around Draco\u2019s waist and pulling, the Snitch\u2019s wings fluttering against the small of his back, his other hand pushing into Draco\u2019s hair as he crushed their mouths together.</p>\n<p>Cogency fled Draco as he grabbed Harry by his robes and yanked him closer, sliding both hands into his wind-ruffled hair as he slanted his head and let Harry ravage his mouth, giving back as good as he took. The noise of the stadium faded away into white noise \u2013 the only thing he even remotely cared about was kissing this gorgeous prat right here. Harry hovered in mid-air, seeming perfectly content to risk falling and breaking his neck as long as he could kiss Draco right there in front of hundreds of pairs of keenly staring eyes.</p>\n<p>Draco felt as though <em>he</em> was flying too.</p>\n<p>Their mouths moved wetly together; Harry's mouth tasted of sunshine and pumpkin juice. His face was cool from having the wind cut across it for so long and Draco\u2019s fingers moved warmly over his cheeks, their lips curling into identical smiles of shy delight at the same time.</p>\n<p>They pulled away and Draco\u2019s heart sang in his ears, his chest rising and falling as they beamed at one another, both of them completely out of breath, Draco completely out of words.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Harry whispered, grabbing Draco\u2019s hand where it lay on his cheek and then pressing something into it. Draco\u2019s fingers closed around the Snitch and he looked back up at Harry with a soft snort. \u201cI keep my promises.\u201d Harry winked.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">And with another kiss to Draco\u2019s wryly grinning mouth, he was zooming away, leaving Draco there with the winning Snitch and jauntily flying away with his heart.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>~end~</strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <img src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/08f9a3b48ef503a96d7901c1e9fc1956/tumblr_orobodrwud1w5x8v4o1_1280.png\" alt width=\"1280\" height=\"949\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n</p>"
