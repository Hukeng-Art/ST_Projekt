  "summary": "<p>Wei Wuxian wishes that he\u2019d told Lan Wangji about the child. Maybe Zhenli would still be alive, then. The Gusulan Sect wouldn\u2019t have let a child of one of their twin jades be killed, even if his mother was the Yiling Patriarch himself.</p>\n<p>/OR/ The self-indulgent one where I create a Wangxian lovechild and go nuts.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Okay, this fic has been sitting in my drafts for months now, and i just dragged myself back into this fandom to complete it haha, I hope you guys enjoy!<br>A quick brief before you guys read this, in this AU Wangxian's lovechild and Lan Sizhui are the same age and they grew up together in Burial Mounds, before Wei Wuxian died and Lan Wangji found them both. Lan Wangji didn't know that Wei Wuxian was pregnant with his child before all the chaos went down, and he only realises the kid is his after he finds him and Wen Yuan in the ruins of Burial Mounds, after Wei Wuxian died.<br>Also Wen Yuan didn't lose his memories of his childhood in this AU, so him and Wangxian's child are very much like brothers.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>In case anyone wanted to know, these are the chinese characters that make up Lan Zhenli | Lan Wangxian's name:<br>\u84dd\u73cd\u7406, which loosely translates to \"value reason/logic\". \u73cd can also be used in the word \u73cd\u8d35, which means precious.<br>\u84dd\u5fd8\u7fa1, I'm sure I don't need to explain the reasoning behind the name! But other than being a shipname, the individual terms can also be taken to mean \"forget\" and \"jealousy/envy\", which actually has pretty noble connotations if you think hard enough, which is also why I thought it was decent enough as a courtesy name.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I'm not really satisfied with the way this fic turned out? Wei Wuxian is a little too mature and ooc, but I'm working on the assumption that as an actual mother with a son he has a lot more reason to not be as much of a carefree happy-go-lucky type.<br>But I hope you guys like it at least!</p>\n<p>Now with <a href=\"https://sterndecorum.tumblr.com/post/181192932208/inspired-by-this-series-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">fanart!!</a><br>By the lovely <a href=\"https://sterndecorum.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">sterndecorum</a><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzzyaOOJIhA/?igshid=u8icz42vnd5n\" rel=\"nofollow\">And more fanart!!</a><br>By the amazing <a href=\"https://instagram.com/alyaristo?igshid=1q9y6cfcpmo0n\" rel=\"nofollow\">alyaristo</a><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_clouddreamer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Instagram</a><br>Pop over and say hi!</p>",
  "text": "<p><em> Why the hell is this spoilt brat kicking me, </em>is the first thought Wei Wuxian has when he returns in the body of Mo Xuanyu.</p>\n<p><em> I wonder what became of A-Li and A-Yuan, </em>is the second.</p>\n<p>The third is, <em> They\u2019re probably dead, like Wen Qing and Wen Ning. </em></p>\n<p>The grief strikes him hard, hard enough that he barely spares a thought for the two abusing his given body.</p>\n<p>It takes a while for Wei Wuxian to gather his thoughts again, but he does so just barely fast enough to catch the tail ends of the enraged teen\u2019s cries, yells of being maligned and insults towards him -or, rather, the body that he resides in- most of which were along the lines of him being worthless and unloved.</p>\n<p>When the pair -young master and servant, if Wei Wuxian had to guess- finally leave, that\u2019s when he finally heaves himself to his feet and examines both the body he\u2019s taken over as well as the strange, pungent-smelling array beneath him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> What the heck am I doing in this person\u2019s body? </em>\n</p>\n<p>The answer comes to him quickly enough, after a moment\u2019s scrutinisation of the bloody array and the gashes littering his body.</p>\n<p>A sacrificial array, huh? There was only one reason anyone ever did things like this. Revenge.</p>\n<p>And looking at the treatment he\u2019d gotten so far, Wei Wuxian was pretty sure who Mo Xuanyu wanted revenge on.</p>\n<p>So, humiliation wouldn\u2019t cut it. Damn.</p>\n<p>The only things Wei Wuxian can think of now are utter despair and loss, or death.</p>\n<p>But is he really desperate enough to destroy an entire family, or murder them in cold blood?</p>\n<p>The idea of it sends shivers down his spine, but at the same time, he <em> really </em>doesn\u2019t want to have his soul ripped apart and annihilated.</p>\n<p>And then he gets dragged out of the donkey shed in the middle of the night, and one of the gashes on his arm has healed.</p>\n<p>He sees the corpse on the ground, sucked dry of qi, and immediately understands.</p>\n<p>Well. That made things\u2026 easier.</p>\n<p>The courtyard is filled with servants and cultivators alike, and before Wei Wuxian can even blink Madam Mo is on him, screaming for his head and brandishing a dagger at him.</p>\n<p>One of the Lan disciples -there seem to be more than the two that were present, earlier- grabs her wrist and forces her to drop the dagger.</p>\n<p>\u201cAttacking a defenseless person is not right,\u201d the disciple intones, face blank.</p>\n<p>Madam Mo screeches, high and crazed. \u201cThe lunatic killed my son! My A-Yuan! He should pay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sees the disciple grit his teeth, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cSizhui,\u201d another disciple says, warningly, a hand coming down to rest on Sizhui\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>This disciple is new. He wasn\u2019t with the other two earlier, in the Mo mansion. He\u2019s wearing the white forehead ribbon of the Lan Sect as well, but his is cloud patterned. In fact, Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t noticed beforehand, but both this new disciple and the disciple that had just saved spoken up for Wei Wuxian are wearing cloud patterned forehead ribbons. A cloud patterned forehead ribbon, which symbolised\u2026 someone who was a descendant of the Lan Sect founder. Someone who wasn\u2019t just a sect disciple, but a clan disciple.</p>\n<p>The two are not the only ones with cloud patterns on their forehead ribbons, but Wei Wuxian does not need the ribbon to tell him that the two are most likely the leaders of this group of disciples. Which meant that they most likely were closer to the main branch of the Lan clan than the few others wearing the cloud patterned forehead ribbon as well, and... well, the closest these two junior disciples could be to the main branch was...</p>\n<p>...Was if their father was one of the Twin Jades.</p>\n<p>And the one who\u2019d spoken up for him -what was his name, Lan Sizhui?- Wei Wuxian can see some form of resemblance, the typical high cheekbones and sharp nose, classically beautiful features.</p>\n<p>But the other disciple- he has a spill of inky black hair, a slender, regal face shape, and wide eyes framed by dark eyelashes.</p>\n<p>It is not hard to guess who his sire is. Even if he doesn\u2019t look exactly like <em> him, </em>the slant of his nose and the golden shine of his eyes tell Wei Wuxian all he needs to know.</p>\n<p>There is only one person Wei Wuxian knows with eyes that beautifully golden.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows that he hasn\u2019t seen this disciple before. Because he would remember if he\u2019d seen those eyes again. The eyes of the only alpha he'd ever liked, ever considered bonding with.</p>\n<p>The alpha whose child he\u2019d carried. The alpha whose child was probably dead by now. The alpha who hadn\u2019t even known about his child.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wishes now that he\u2019d told Lan Wangji about the child. Maybe Zhenli would still be alive, then. The Gusulan Sect wouldn\u2019t have let a child of one of their Twin Jades be killed, even if his mother was the Yiling Patriarch himself. Maybe they would have spared Wen Yuan too.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shaken out of his thoughts by Madam Mo\u2019s shrieking yet again, and when he looks up this time she\u2019s being physically restrained by both Sizhui and the other disciple with his Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>The disciple shifts closer to Wei Wuxian, and he catches a whiff of parental scent marking on the boy. The familiar mixed scent of sandalwood and snow hits Wei Wuxian like a tidal wave, and he freezes.</p>\n<p>Even if Wei Wuxian had wanted to deny who the boy\u2019s sire had to be, even if he\u2019d wanted to bury the truth...</p>\n<p>So Lan Wangji had found a mate after all.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t smell another parent\u2019s scent mark on the boy, so either Lan Wangji\u2019s mate was a beta, or they were an omega with a scent that was easily overpowered by their mate\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tells himself the clenching of his heart is just a natural reaction to his almost-mate\u2019s scent after thirteen years. It wasn\u2019t jealousy. It wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Then one of the Lan disciples -Jingyi, was it?- pulls out a Phantom Attraction Flag from Mo Ziyuan\u2019s robes. Immediately, the truth of the matter becomes clear.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian watches the Lan disciples explain the matter to Madam Mo, his focus momentarily turned from his own emotions to the current happenings. He watches Madam Mo snap at the disciples, yelling at them for \u201cneglect\u201d and \u201cincompetence\u201d. He watches her scream at them for not being able to protect a seventeen year old boy. He watches her scream at them as if they\u2019re the ones responsible for making sure that someone older than them would understand simple instructions.</p>\n<p>The boys were young, barely of age to night hunt by themselves, and unless Wei Wuxian was so severely out of the loop that he hadn\u2019t even heard of Lan Wangji getting a mate before he died, said man\u2019s son couldn\u2019t be more than thirteen. The same went for the other disciple, Lan Sizhui. Even if he wasn\u2019t Lan Wangji\u2019s son, and was Lan Xichen\u2019s, there was no way one of the Twin Jades got married and Wei Wuxian, even living in his cave on the Burial Mounds, wouldn\u2019t have heard of it. Neither of them could be more than thirteen. The other disciples couldn\u2019t be more than fifteen, maybe sixteen, given their youthful appearances and general lack of experience in night hunting. It wasn\u2019t to say they weren\u2019t in possession of high levels of cultivation- all of the disciples in front of him were of high enough levels that he could actually feel the spiritual energy radiating from them, but as fresh out of the Cloud Recesses as they were, Wei Wuxian doubted that they\u2019d ever gone night hunting without a supervising senior before.</p>\n<p>Madam Mo has no right screaming at boys who\u2019ve already tried their best to protect her and her family.</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt your son is so young that he can\u2019t understand clear instructions, Madam Mo,\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps, dropping the mask of a lunatic for all of a second. \u201cDid you not hear what they said earlier? Stay out of the courtyard. Don\u2019t blame them just because your son has sticky fingers and a thief\u2019s urges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Mo gapes, hatred and grief burning bright in her eyes, before she turns and snaps at her husband to order everyone inside the house.</p>\n<p>Chaos descends as Master Mo pushes her to the ground instead of obeying like he\u2019d always done, and then servants are scrambling to help her to her feet even as they all begin streaming towards the doors of the house.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a scream, and another person is dead, and Wei Wuxian sees the way the Lan disciples exchange anxious glances.</p>\n<p>This is a dangerous spirit, there\u2019s no doubt about it. It\u2019s far more powerful than the average walking corpse, or even the average vicious ghoul, that much is clear.</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian knows the Lan disciples are young enough that the odds of them having met such deadly spirits are extremely, <em> extremely </em>low.</p>\n<p>Lan Sizhui is asking if they\u2019d sent up the signal yet, and Wei Wuxian prays that there\u2019s a senior cultivator nearby, because these boys, as high in cultivation as they are, are far too inexperienced to deal with something as strong as this spirit is turning out to be.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows he should go, should take the chance and leave while everyone else is distracted, avoid the possibility of bumping into anyone that he would have known in his past life. But he can\u2019t leave the vicinity of the Mo family until the curse is fulfilled, and\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want Lan Wangji\u2019s son to die if he can help it.</p>\n<p>Then A-Tong dies, then Madam Mo dies, and everything descends into chaos in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>The Lan disciples are barely managing to hold the demonic left arm in, caged within a sword fence, and even Lan Wangji\u2019s son\u2019s blade -undoubtedly a sword of the caliber of the legendary Bichen itself- is wavering under the force of demonic strength.</p>\n<p>The fierce corpses of the Mo family that Wei Wuxian animates holds back the demonic arm for a while longer, after the sword fence breaks. But even three savage, fierce corpses can\u2019t keep it at bay for long, and Wei Wuxian knows that if he does more, the chances of being revealed for who he really is increase drastically.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t let innocent children die. Especially not Lan Wangji\u2019s son.</p>\n<p>So Wei Wuxian prepares to let loose the whistle that will increase the power of the fierce corpses of the Mo family.</p>\n<p>Then the familiar strum of a guqin splits the air.</p>\n<p>Perched on the roof of the Mo family residence, white robes flowing in the wind and haloed by moonlight, black hair an inky spill across the moon-bright sky, is Lan Wangji. He\u2019s even better looking now than he was in the past, the last remnants of teenage chub have faded from his face, leaving behind high cheekbones and a regal face, perfectly arched brows and narrow, almond eyes. His fingers stroke the strings of his guqin carefully, caressing it and wringing out the purest notes, filling the air with spiritual energy.</p>\n<p>He looks ethereal in this lighting, like he\u2019s on the brink of ascension, or like he\u2019s descended from the heavens, an immortal being of unparalleled beauty and grace.</p>\n<p>\u201cHan Guang-Jun!\u201d The Lan disciples shout, and Wei Wuxian hides a wince as Lan Wangji\u2019s son shouts a relieved, \u201cFather!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to take his leave, then, Wei Wuxian thinks as he glances up at the otherworldly beauty that is Lan Wangji. His heart clenches. Time to go, before he does something stupid, like try to jump a bonded alpha.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em> It\u2019s just one mess after another, isn\u2019t it, </em>Wei Wuxian reflects ruefully after Bichen\u2019s light blinds him and he falls, landing ungracefully at Lan Wangji\u2019s feet. Behind him, Jiang Cheng\u2019s familiar, outraged scent mixes with Lan Wangji\u2019s more mellow one, a strange but not unfamiliar combination, and Wei Wuxian is kind of upset. All those years growing up together with Jiang Cheng, and he\u2019d never had any reason to doubt him, but the events leading up to his death leave a sour taste in the back of his mouth, and even though neither Lan Wangji nor Jiang Cheng know who he is, it doesn\u2019t change the way he feels seeing the two alphas he was the closest to fight like this.</p>\n<p>It goes on down this path for a long while, Jiang Cheng getting angrier and angrier while Lan Wangji just holds his gaze coolly.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Lan Wangji\u2019s son -Wei Wuxian still hadn\u2019t gotten his name, unbelievably- and Jin Ling are locked in a vicious staring contest, and the glare on Lan Wangji\u2019s son\u2019s face is maybe the most emotion Wei Wuxian has ever seen on a member of the Gusulan clan.</p>\n<p>And then Jiang Cheng steps down, and Lan Wangji relaxes ever so slightly, barely perceptible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangxian,\u201d Lan Wangji says, voice low, a hand on his son\u2019s shoulder. His tone is warning.</p>\n<p>Immediately, his son subsides, stepping away from glaring at Jin Ling and offering his father an apologetic look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Father,\u201d Lan Wangxian says, head bowed.</p>\n<p>The sudden lull in the atmosphere that comes with having his wrist grabbed and playing stopped abruptly is jarring, especially with the way Lan Wangji\u2019s scent plays havoc with his senses, as close as the other man is standing. Wei Wuxian curses the fact that even in possession of a new body, he\u2019s still an omega. Being this sensitive to Lan Wangji\u2019s scent was\u2026 annoying.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that he minds being an omega -he really doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s fun watching people underestimate him and pay the price- but at times like this he hated it, especially the extra-sensitive omegan nose that came with everything else.</p>\n<p>And then Jiang Cheng\u2019s there, furious and suspicious, and Zidian is crackling with energy even as Lan Wangji stands, an unwavering fortress in front of him.</p>\n<p>The omega in him is more than pleased to be protected by the alpha he likes, but the logical part of his brain screams at him to <em> run. </em> Because he can\u2019t get caught by any of them. Not Jiang Cheng, and <em> definitely </em>not Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>If he gets dragged back to the Cloud Recesses one more time he thinks he might actually die. Not because of the crazy wall of rules -although that\u2019s a part of the reason- but because Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think he can stand seeing Lan Wangji actually in the presence of his mate. Not after Wei Wuxian had spent the years before his death silently staring after the alpha, not when they\u2019d had one night of everything Wei Wuxian had ever dreamed before he realised how stupid of a dream it was.</p>\n<p>Someone of Lan Wangji\u2019s refinement and bloodline would never like a servant\u2019s son like himself. It didn\u2019t matter how high his cultivation was, because Lan Wangji was always better. And now he\u2019s in a body with low cultivation, and even better, he\u2019s slapped with the title of a lunatic as well. Even if Lan Wangji knew who he was -and Wei Wuxian prays that day never comes, because he doesn\u2019t think he can take the rejection and resentment twice over- he would never catch the eye of the alpha.</p>\n<p>But what did it matter? Lan Wangji was mated, with a child. Wei Wuxian would never break apart a family like that.</p>\n<p>So Wei Wuxian runs, arms flailing like he really <em> is </em> a lunatic, and the burning strike of Zidian across his back is familiar. Even then, he falls and forces himself up to stand again, sputtering indignant words, and watches as Jiang Cheng readies himself for a second strike and the Lan disciples shout in protest.</p>\n<p>Then Jiang Cheng signals for his men to take him, and Wei Wuxian cuts his losses. He jumps behind Lan Wangji and makes a show of cowering behind the taller man, arms over his head and expression startled and frightened.</p>\n<p>Better to go with Lan Wangji than with Jiang Cheng. There was a far lesser chance of being found out back in Gusu, rather than in Yunmeng where everyone knew him, and he they. No matter how emotionally painful it might be, Gusu was the better choice by far.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond Young Master Lan,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, voice deceptively level. \u201c\u201dAre you purposefully making things difficult for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a bigger show of cowering and hiding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you bothering an innocent man, Sect Leader Jiang?\u201d Lan Sizhui asks, expression politely neutral.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe evidence has made it clear that Mo Xuanyu\u2019s body is his own,\u201d Lan Wangxian continues, moving to stand beside Lan Sizhui. \u201cAs Sizhui has said, why are you troubling an unimportant man such as him? Should Zidian\u2019s strike not ring true?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng growls. \u201cSecond Young Master La-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian abruptly bursts into stifled giggles. \u201cSect Leader Jiang, your, um\u2026 interest is really flattering, and an omega like myself still wants to find a nice alpha mate. But I don\u2019t just like all alphas, Sect Leader!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng\u2019s expression pulls into a furious scowl. \u201cYou- That isn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor example!\u201d Wei Wuxian continues blithely, keeping the mischievous grin from his cheeks using pure willpower. \u201cI\u2019m not into alphas like you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng\u2019s expression is enraged now, both at the perceived slight and the impertinence in Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen,\u201d Jiang Cheng asks, words almost a hiss. \u201cPray tell, what kind of alpha <em> do </em>you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lets himself stare at Lan Wangji for far too long, lets himself flush red, and smiles, far too wide to look completely sane. \u201cAlphas like Han Guang-jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>He knew both Jiang Cheng and Lan Wangji well enough that the insult to Jiang Cheng and the completely uncalled for affection towards Lan Wangji would be received with disgust. Hopefully, it would be enough disgust for both of them to let him escape.</p>\n<p>But then Lan Wangji turns to look at him, expression serious, and nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> What? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI am taking this person back to Cloud Recesses with me,\u201d Lan Wangji announces abruptly, turning back to face Jiang Cheng, and Wei Wuxian watches as Jiang Cheng\u2019s face reddens with anger, but he doesn\u2019t say anything as Lan Wangji drags Wei Wuxian away, the Lan disciples following behind.</p>\n<p>\u201dFather,\u201d Lan Wangxian says after they\u2019ve left Dafan Mountain, eyeing where his father is walking ahead of the strange omega, who\u2019s sitting sulkily on top of his donkey. \u201cIs bringing this man back to the Cloud Recesses truly a good idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just hums in response, but Lan Wangxian hears the unspoken \u201cyes\u201d, and subsides. He doesn\u2019t understand his father\u2019s reasoning, but he trusts him. Father has never led him wrong before.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a while back to Gusu, and the entire trip Lan Wangxian eyes his father\u2019s behaviour. To an outsider his father may seem completely unreadable, emotionless, but Wangxian has known his sire since he was four, and was personally raised by him. He can read the gentle motions with which his father treats the omega on the donkey, the way his gaze lingers a tad too long on tan skin and dark robes.</p>\n<p>His father is\u2026 attracted to the strange omega.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangxian doesn\u2019t know how to feel about this. He\u2019s never seen his father ever so much as glance at another omega, never paying attention to even the people on the street who would throw flowers his way, but this- this omega man who everyone\u2019s labelled as a lunatic, who no one seems to know what to make of- Lan Wangxian can tell that he\u2019s caught his father\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangxian wants his father to be happy- of course he does, he\u2019s seen the years his father mourned after Lan Wangxian\u2019s mother died. He knows Father has spent weeks, hours after hours, sitting just outside the Jingshi, playing Inquiry over and over again.</p>\n<p>But Lan Wangxian was not young enough to not have memories of his mother before he died. As much as he wants Father to be happy, he doesn\u2019t want Father to mate with another omega, doesn\u2019t want a stepmother to replace the memories still held close to his heart.</p>\n<p>He remembers laughing eyes, strong arms carrying him after he took his first steps, remembers the soft, sweet scent of lotus blooms and mellow spice, remembers crawling after his brother in all but blood, tussling around on the floor while Mum looked after them, hands stroking over his dizi.</p>\n<p>He remembers confusion when there\u2019d been a day when Mum had left the cave, and hadn\u2019t come back. He remembers huddling with Brother up in the branches of a tree as the cave got destroyed, remembers a startled face finding both himself and Brother hidden away, and then warm hands lifting him into an embrace that felt safer than any strangers\u2019 should have.</p>\n<p>He has good memories of Mum, and he wants them to stay that way. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to replace his memories of Mum. Having Father and Brother and Uncle was enough.</p>\n<p>But he sees Father\u2019s care in the way he leads the omega\u2019s donkey, the way he tugs the creature along with a gentleness that barely stirs the omega perched atop it. He sees the way Father\u2019s gaze constantly strays to the omega\u2019s, to long, nimble fingers still stroking over that hastily crafted bamboo dizi.</p>\n<p>He remembers overhearing Uncle and Grand Uncle talking about it once, Uncle\u2019s worried voice speaking about how Father had been mourning for far too long.</p>\n<p>And he agrees, because Father had been mourning for the entire time Lan Wangxian has known him.</p>\n<p>He thinks he may not have to acknowledge the new omega as his mother. But he wouldn\u2019t be against Father finally moving on.</p>\n<p>The notes of his song are still playing through his head, a constant loop of too sharp, too high notes, almost screeches in how badly played they are, but Lan Wangji would recognise those notes anywhere.</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s only one person who could ever know that song, other than him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying. This strange, supposedly insane, <em> infuriating </em>omega is Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Really, he should have guessed. Only one person could ever get under his skin so quickly and effectively.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s Wei Wuxian. Wei Ying. <em> His </em>Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Wangxian and Sizhui would be so happy to know- no, he can\u2019t tell them, not yet. Not until he\u2019s sure that Wei Wuxian remembers them, until he\u2019s sure his children won\u2019t get their hopes up for nothing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard of many, many different ways of souls coming back by possessing another body, but for Zidian\u2019s strike to not have had an effect- it was\u2026 confusing.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s only ever heard of the one ritual offering up one\u2019s own body, and even then he\u2019s only heard the very vaguest snippets of it, and only because he\u2019d gone digging for any information on souls returning to the earthly plane.</p>\n<p>And one thing he\u2019d found out was that returned souls almost always had gaps in their memory. And it didn\u2019t help that the Wei Wuxian Lan Wangji had known was scatterbrained enough to forget where he\u2019d put something even if said something was right under his hand.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji needed to know if Wei Wuxian remembered Lan Zhenli and Wen Yuan before he made any move to tell either of them. He couldn\u2019t burden any of the three of them with the guilt of forgetting or the pain of hopes dashed. His family has already been so fractured for so long, he would spare them any pain that he could.</p>\n<p>By the time they get back to the Cloud Recesses, it\u2019s late afternoon the next day, and Wei Wuxian is throwing a fit outside their doorstep.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji barely stops himself from rolling his eyes, somehow unflustered even as Wei Wuxian blatantly breaks at least three of their rules in one go. He just tells Lan Jingyi and Lan Sizhui to drag Wei Wuxian in after he tires himself out, walking into Cloud Recesses with Lan Wangxian following behind.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has been meditating -or, well, trying to meditate through Wei Wuxian\u2019s wailing- for a while before he hears the nearby sound of a dizi playing, too polished and clean to be Wei Wuxian\u2019s carelessly crafted bamboo one, and he feels his lips twitch ever so slightly when Wei Wuxian\u2019s melodramatic cries die down at the sound.</p>\n<p>The melody flows, and Lan Wangji can hear the improvement in the pacing and tune. Lan Wangxian has been playing the dizi less often lately, focusing on the guqin instead, and nowadays the sound of the dizi only really echoes through Cloud Recesses once or twice a week, compared to how it\u2019d used to be almost daily.</p>\n<p>He remembers how Lan Wangxian had come up to him when he was younger, asking if he could learn the dizi because he had memories of how Mum used to play the dizi for him and Brother. The image those words had planted in Lan Wangji\u2019s mind had been bittersweet, his heart aching at the thought of missing such a scene.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s missed many, many milestones in his son\u2019s life, Lan Wangji knows. His first words, first steps, everything a young child goes through. But Wei Wuxian has missed more, through no fault of his own, and Lan Wangji wants nothing more than to reunite him with their child. It\u2019s a reunion Lan Wangji thinks he would like to see.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still in the midst of attempting to get kicked out of Cloud Recesses when the unmistakable melody of a dizi echoes through the air. He freezes, and the wail on the tip of his tongue falters and dies. No one in Gusulan plays the dizi. Gusulan is known for the guqin, and, very occasionally, other string instruments like the pipa or erhu, but never an instrument like the dizi.</p>\n<p>He freezes, and then the two Lan disciples that Lan Wangji left to keep an eye on him grab him by the arms and drag him past the barrier in the Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>Damn.</p>\n<p>Strangely enough Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t brought to anywhere he expects to be brought, like maybe the Library Pavillion, or some lone hut that serves as a prison, or even the mingshi. Instead, he\u2019s brought up to Lan Wangji, who orders him to be brought to the jingshi, and Wei Wuxian startles. The last he knew, the jingshi was Lan Wangji\u2019s own bedroom and study, although he guesses now that Lan Wangji is mated he may not live there anymore. But still, the jingshi was practically a forbidden area, really the only place that Wei Wuxian had never even considered breaking into when he\u2019d last been at Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s left in the jingshi for the rest of the day, and Wei Wuxian is surprised to find that Lan Wangji really does still live here, as is evident by the scent of sandalwood and snow that lingers in every nook and cranny of the room. It\u2019s strange that he can\u2019t find any sign of another occupant in the room, no additional robes other than the one that are clearly in Lan Wangji\u2019s size, no other possessions other than the small table Lan Wangji writes and plays his guqin on. There\u2019s nothing in the room that could hint at a mate, although Wei Wuxian does find a small chest of children\u2019s clothing tucked away unobtrusively in one corner of the room.</p>\n<p>Maybe Lan Wangji\u2019s mating had been an arranged one? It would explain why the man and his mate were clearly sleeping in separate rooms, and why Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t seen anybody welcoming Lan Wangji back when they\u2019d arrived.</p>\n<p>Throughout his entire time spent in the jingshi, the haunting melody of the dizi still drifts in through the open windows, sending shivers down Wei Wuxian\u2019s spine at the cool skill of the player. It\u2019s not at the level of skill that Wei Wuxian himself had been at before he died, but it\u2019s undoubtedly good, far better than average and good enough to make Wei Wuxian wonder if he could best than the mystery player, rusty as he was.</p>\n<p>He wants to know who\u2019s playing the dizi. So he leaves his rummaging of Lan Wangji\u2019s room to later and sneaks out of the jingshi, making sure none of the Lan disciples see him and stop him. Following the tune, Wei Wuxian finds himself standing outside the Library Pavillion, where he can see Lan Wangji seated at the short table, poring over a scroll, and Lan Wangxian is standing off to the corner, a dizi in his hands, the wood a brown so dark that it seems black, well polished and clearly cared for. So Lan Wangji\u2019s son is the one playing the dizi. Wei Wuxian finds that strange, in that he always thought someone of the Lan clan would definitely pick up the guqin, and nothing else. But clearly Lan Wangji is not disapproving of his son\u2019s actions, because even as Wei Wuxian watches, the alpha turns his cool gaze on his son and nods approvingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are doing well, Wangxian,\u201d the man says, and is that- is that the barest hint of <em> pride </em>Wei Wuxian hears in Lan Wangji\u2019s voice?</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but Lan Wangji is a good father. He imagines what it would have been like to have Zhenli grow up with both parents there, to watch as Lan Wangji expressed his love for their child in the smallest of ways. It hurts, a sharp pang in his chest as he imagines Zhenli\u2019s wide gold eyes shine with happiness, imagines seeing Lan Wangji\u2019s own gold eyes showing the pride that Wei Wuxian sees him demonstrating now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Father,\u201d Lan Wangxian says, and the smile that lights up his face is almost enough to send Wei Wuxian reeling in shock. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen <em> any </em>member of the Gusulan Sect express emotion so readily, and strangely enough, the look of that smile seems familiar, somehow, even though Wei Wuxian knows that Lan Wangji\u2019s smiles, rare as they are, do not resemble the blinding grin that overtakes his son\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Maybe Lan Wangxian takes after his dam in that aspect, then.</p>\n<p>A long silence falls after the short exchange, punctuated only by the soft swish of Lan Wangji\u2019s brush across paper, or the rustle of fabric as Lan Wangxian polishes his dizi.</p>\n<p>Soon Wei Wuxian tires of spying, seeing as the pair are doing nothing out of the ordinary, and turns around and heads back to the jingshi.</p>\n<p>He just misses the soft, \u201cFa- Dad, will I ever be as good as Mum?\u201d and a moment\u2019s hesitation before a reply comes.</p>\n<p>Night falls far quicker than Wei Wuxian expects, and before he knows it there are disciples leaving food outside the door of the jingshi, and then less than an hour later Lan Wangji himself is entering the room, and the bell signalling curfew tolls soon after.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji directs him to another section of the jingshi, an area partitioned off from the rest of the room with a separate bed, and then all but orders him to sleep.</p>\n<p>For a long moment Wei Wuxian toys with the idea of annoying Lan Wangji enough to get himself thrown out of Cloud Recesses, maybe flirt with him until he gets uncomfortable, or blatantly try to sleep in his bed, but ultimately decides against it. He doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with his traitor heart, or the consequences of what might happen should someone find him in Lan Wangji\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>He <em> really </em> doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for breaking apart someone\u2019s family.</p>\n<p>So he lays in his given bed, staring at the white ceiling and the sloping roof, the way the moonlight shines in through the open window, and he doesn\u2019t even realise when he falls asleep.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji generally sleeps all the way through from nine to five, his body clock having been trained that way since young, so when he jolts awake and the moon is still high in the sky and the entirety of Cloud Recesses is utterly silent, he\u2019s immediately wary. As far as he\u2019s figured out, nothing short of being attacked could mess with his sleep cycle, so when there\u2019s no sounds of battle anywhere nearby he\u2019s understandably confused.</p>\n<p>Then he notices the scent of omega in distress, almost overpowering, and as he stands and makes his way over to Wei Wuxian\u2019s portion of the room, he hears the softest whimpers coming from behind the partition, accompanied by the occasional mumbled word.</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji enters the separated section of the room, he sees Wei Wuxian lying on his bed, a thin sheen of sweat coating his forehead. The other man is tossing and turning restlessly, and while Wei Wuxian may be in a different body, his scent is still extremely similar, especially the way he\u2019s in distress right now, and the way the omega writhes in panic is heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is mumbling in his sleep, clearly in the throes of a nightmare. His features are scrunched tight, brow furrowed and teeth gritted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he mumbles, soft and panicked. \u201cNo, no, not- please, no-</p>\n<p><em> \u201cNo! Please!\u201d </em>Wei Wuxian shouts abruptly, thrashing violently. \u201cNot- no- Zhenli, A-Yuan- please-\u201d</p>\n<p>The scent of distress has completely permeated the small room, sharp and bitter and completely unlike Wei Wuxian\u2019s usual scent, and Lan Wangji\u2019s heart stutters. The pain in Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice shakes Lan Wangji to his core, a deep, soul rending kind of agony.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot my children,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, so softly that Lan Wangji barely hears him. \u201cNot them, please, kill me instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji steps forward, hesitantly placing a hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. Even through his robes Lan Wangji can feel the clamminess of panic and anxiety, feel the tremors that wreck the other\u2019s form.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, shaking the man slightly. \u201cWei Ying, wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turns towards him, eyes still closed, but Lan Wangji sees the way his form stills ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, wake up,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, shaking just a tad harder, and watches as the other man\u2019s eyes snap open, clouded with fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d He gasps, gaze immediately fixing on Lan Wangji, eyes desperate. \u201cLan Zhan, where\u2019s- Zhenli- Wen Yuan- Lan Zhan- our son-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Lan Wangji stalls the omega with a word and a raise of his hand. \u201cYou are safe here. Calm down. Remember where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji would more than willingly give up his pretense of not knowing who Wei Wuxian was if it would calm the other man down.</p>\n<p>Then he sees Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen, and sees the way the omega immediately switches personalities, plastering a wide, crazed smile on his lips and throwing himself at Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cHan Guang-jun!\u201d He cries, grinning. \u201cI had the best dream, Han Guang-jun is the most handsome alpha- How amazing! Ah, I really am very attracted to Han Guang-jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>The complete emotional one-eighty startles Lan Wangji, even as he understands why Wei Wuxian does it. The other man is desperately trying to cover up the fact that he\u2019d all but given himself away, and Lan Wangji watches, bemused, as Wei Wuxian spouts more and more crazed nonsense. Finally, Lan Wangji decides to put a stop to the lunacy, shaking his head once. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian falters for a split second before picking up the charade once more. \u201cWei Ying? Who\u2019s that? Han Guang-jun, you may be pretty, but are you sure your eyesight is okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs. \u201cWei Ying. Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sees the moment that Wei Wuxian gives up the farce.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d He asks, shoulders slumping as the grin slips from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 not going to ask about what I said earlier?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his heart clench at the vulnerability in Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice. He knows for certain now that Wei Wuxian remembers Lan Zhenli and Wen Yuan, and suddenly the realisation that Wei Wuxian has been living the past few days under the assumption that his <em> -their- </em> children were dead almost bowls him over.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns away then, to look out of the window, at the houses where the Lan disciples stay during the course of their studies.</p>\n<p>\u201cZhenli is alive,\u201d he says, so soft that for a long moment he thinks Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t hear him. But then he turns, and meets Wei Wuxian\u2019s stunned mercurial gaze. Those silver eyes are brimming with unshed tears, lips parted ever so slightly in shock. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found them in the ruins of the Burial Mounds,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and watches Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes light up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThem?\u201d He asks, voice breathy with shock and hope. \u201cYou mean- Wen Yuan-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes, eyes wide. \u201cLan Zhan- where- please- my sons-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already met them both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho- Lan Wangxian! He- my son- he\u2019s my A-Li?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, lips twitching as Wei Wuxian\u2019s tears finally fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe looks so much like you, Lan Zhan. When I first saw him I almost thought he was you, when I saw the eyes, but- my baby, my A-Li, he looks so much like both of us, Lan Zhan- he has my hair- and my eye shape-\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd A-Yuan- who-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Sizhui,\u201d Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one who- of course, the two of them were so close- Lan Zhan, my sons are so grown up now, I\u2019ve missed so much-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stutters to a halt, silver eyes darting up to look at him. \u201cLan Zhan- take me to them- please- Lan Zhan-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is past curfew,\u201d Lan Wangji says, but the rules don\u2019t stop the pang of regret that shoots through him at Wei Wuxian\u2019s crestfallen expression. \u201cThe disciples will all be sleeping, we cannot disturb them. You will have to wait until five, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites his lip, eyes closed, but he nods all the same. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has never seen the other man so compliant, but the way his eyes dart to track the passage of the moon in the sky and the way he folds himself into the lotus position and wipes surreptitiously at his eyes makes Lan Wangji think that maybe Wei Wuxian needs the time to gather himself as well.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait! Lan Zhan-\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pauses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you- will you stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns and sits down by Wei Wuxian\u2019s side. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian wakes, Lan Wangji is already up, seated calmly at his bedside, cleaning Bichen\u2019s blade.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d the alpha says, looking up. \u201cYou are awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan- ah! So that wasn\u2019t a dream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Li,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, soft, almost frightened. \u201cA-Yuan. Will you take me to them? Will- Do they still remember me, Lan Zhan? They were so young when- I tried to keep them away from the cave before I burned it down- I couldn\u2019t- I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, calm as ever. \u201cWhy do you think Zhenli\u2019s courtesy name is like so? Brother helped me choose one for him, but he says Zhenli mentioned wanting that name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian freezes. \u201cLan Wangxian\u2026 Wangxian-\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji picks up a brush, and writes down the two characters.</p>\n<p>The character for \u2018forget\u2019\u2026 and then two dots, two horizontal lines, a vertical one then another horizontal one. Two more dots. A short downwards stroke, a horizontal line ending in a hook, then two more downward strokes.</p>\n<p>Xi\u00e0n.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t just a homonym, not a random word that sounded the same. There were so many other words out there with the same pronunciation, it could have been any one of them. But it was the character for envy. The one that made up his own courtesy name.</p>\n<p>And just as his own name, put together, meant \u201cwithout envy\u201d, his son\u2019s meant \u201cforget envy\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first character of your name, and the last character of mine\u2026 this child of mine has definitely inherited my sense of romance, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Can we go see A-Yuan and A-Li now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands, and turns to the door. \u201cCome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian scrambles to his feet, grabbing his outer robes and hastily wears them, tying the sash at his waist with shaky fingers.</p>\n<p>Gods, he can\u2019t wait to see them again.</p>\n<p>The appearance of Han Guang-jun at the disciples\u2019 bunks is uncommon enough that most of the disciples freeze in their tracks, still in varying states of dress. All are decent, in their outer robes and all, but a few are still sporting untied hair and a distinct lack of a forehead ribbon.</p>\n<p>All of them snap to attention immediately, cheeks flushed at being caught unprepared, but bowing respectfully anyway.</p>\n<p>The sight of the strange omega trailing along behind Han Guang-jun sends confused murmurs down the halls, but the murmurs stay almost inaudible, and Wei Wuxian ignores them easily. Occasionally he sees Lan Wangji twitch when a murmur reaches his sharp ears, but Lan Wangji seems to be ignoring the words as well.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stops in front of one of the disciples\u2019 doors, and knocks once, then waits. Lan Sizhui answers the door, already fully-dressed and presentable, and Wei Wuxian sees the boy in a completely different light. Now, Wei Wuxian\u2019s old memories of Wen Yuan -little, precocious, outspoken Wen Yuan- are overlaid onto this teenager, this sixteen year old boy who Wei Wuxian had watched grow up for a good three years. And now Wei Wuxian sees the resemblance, in cheeks that the remnants of baby fat still cling to, in the shape and colour of wide eyes. Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart skips a beat, and it\u2019s only Lan Wangji\u2019s arm holding him back that prevents him from grabbing the younger boy and not letting go.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Wuxian sees the way Lan Sizhui\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cGet your brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Sizhui -Wen Yuan, A-Yuan, one of his little baby boys- nods quickly and darts back into the room.</p>\n<p>A moment later Lan Wangxian -his son, his baby, the boy he\u2019d birthed, watched grow up- meets them at the door, standing side-by-side with Lan Sizhui, both looking up at their father.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and then turns, leaving Wei Wuxian to scramble after him even as his heart beats a rapid tattoo in his chest.</p>\n<p><em> You can\u2019t make a fool of yourself in the middle of Cloud Recesses, </em> Wei Wuxian hisses inwardly. <em> You can\u2019t let the entire GusuLan know you\u2019re the mother of Lan Wangji\u2019s children! </em></p>\n<p>So Wei Wuxian keeps the patter of his heart to himself, and tells himself the way his vision blurs at the edges is just dust getting in his eyes.</p>\n<p>When the four of them are back in the jingshi, Lan Wangxian is the first to break the silence, a curious set to his eyebrows as he turns to Lan Wangji. \u201cFather, is there a reason you called us away from our room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, expressionless. \u201cEn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHan Guang-jun?\u201d That\u2019s Lan Sizhui, and Wei Wuxian has to wonder why Zhenli calls Lan Wangji \u201cfather\u201d, but A-Yuan doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji remains silent, and Wei Wuxian sighs inwardly. He always <em> did </em>do all the talking among the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you two know why Han Guang-jun saved me at Dafan Mountain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangxian and Lan Sizhui both frown ever so slightly, and Wei Wuxian sees Lan Sizhui begin to shake his head, before Lan Wangxian breaks in with a hesitant, \u201cFather\u2026 is attracted to you. That\u2019s why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian splutters, and sees the tips of Lan Wangji\u2019s ears flush red.</p>\n<p>Lan Sizhui\u2019s impassive face breaks into a grin, and he hides a laugh behind his palm before he calms himself.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head, and can\u2019t help the fond smile that tugs at his lips. \u201cYou truly are like your father, A-Li-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian falters then, hearing the endearment slip from between his lips unbidden, seeing the way Lan Wangxian freezes up, and Lan Sizhui starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you to call me that?\u201d Lan Wangxian demands after a moment\u2019s shock, and Wei Wuxian sees the anger in the set of his eyes. \u201cNo one other than Father has ever called me that, not since I was three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian offers a grin, channeling sheepishness into false confidence. \u201cAnd your mother can\u2019t call you that, A-Li?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sees the outrage at that, fury in every line of his son\u2019s face, and, okay, now Wei Wuxian can see the resemblance between him and his son. The anger on Lan Wangxian\u2019s face transforms his features into something Wei Wuxian used to see in the mirror, in his old body.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare-\u201d Lan Wangxian says, and even Lan Sizhui looks angry now, brows furrowed and fists clenched.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you hate the Yiling Patriarch, or if he killed your entire family, or you hate what he did- you don\u2019t insult my mother\u2019s memory!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart stutters. He hadn\u2019t thought- he\u2019d only really had A-Li for all of three years, less than a quarter of his life, and- A-Li still loved him, still felt strongly about him-</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is moving before he can think, grabbing his son in a tight embrace, stroking his messy hair. Lan Wangxian shrugs his hug off violently, pushing away from him to glare, eyes practically sparking with rage. Wei Wuxian tells himself the treatment is because his son doesn\u2019t know who he is, but nevertheless the hurt tugs at his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, placing a hand on his shoulder, and Wei Wuxian responds habitually before the shock on both Lan Wangxian\u2019s and Lan Sizhui\u2019s face reminds him of where he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-But-\u201d Lan Sizhui starts, eyes wide. \u201cZidian\u2019s strike-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly works if the body is being possessed,\u201d Wei Wuxian says cheerfully. \u201cThis body happened to have been sacrificed willingly to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you are truly\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM- Mama?\u201d And Lan Wangxian\u2019s voice is trembling, soft and hesitant and <em> afraid, </em>like he\u2019s going to be rejected at any moment.</p>\n<p>Lan Sizhui looks equally stunned, a breathy, \u201cMa- Xian-gege?\u201d falling from his lips.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles through blurry eyes, and pulls both his sons into a tight hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times have I told you, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian chides softly. \u201cIf you want to call me Mama, you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Sizhui laughs softly, and buries his face in Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOkay, Mama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him, Lan Wangxian is stiff as a board, and Wei Wuxian can smell the shock in his scent, sandalwood and spice diluted by the bittersweet smell of surprise.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles, pressing kisses to the top of both his sons\u2019 heads, and holds them close.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, A-Li,\u201d he whispers, and he feels more than smells the way his own scent melts into something comforting and soothing, the spice of chilli dimming into a mellow undertone, a complement to the sweet bloom of lotus flowers. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s really me, A-Bao, I\u2019m back, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels the second Lan Wangxian crumples in his arms, folding in on himself and pressing close, and he feels the hot tears that soak his robes, and Wei Wuxian feels his own tears begin to slip down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Thirteen years, his sons have been without him. There\u2019s so much of their lives that he\u2019s missed, so much that he doesn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s back, and now he has the rest of their lives to find out.</p>"
