  "text": "<p>Draco recast the ward over his cauldron and set a timer for ten minutes. The last ingredient\u2014a few drops of Horklump juice\u2014sat in its own warded vial as Draco cleared up his work table. There was a minuscule <em>ping</em> as yet another unidentified object attempted to get into his cauldron, and Draco felt a dark satisfaction as that object rebounded back to whomever had thrown it; a few tables to the left in the row ahead of him, there was a loud squawk of surprise and a rush of words from Slughorn as he assisted that unfocused student.</p>\n<p>Slughorn rarely approached Draco\u2019s table at the back of the Potions classroom. It suited Draco fine, having suspected that Slughorn was more of a hindrance than a help. Uncle Severus, <em>he</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Draco shoved the thought away and focused back on his cauldron. With four more minutes on his timer, the milky colour in the potion was fading. He reduced the heat slightly and made a note in his potions journal.</p>\n<p>Potter worked on a desk nearer the front, Weasel (<em>Weasley</em>) and Granger flanking him. The Boy Wonder was hunched over, and there was a brief flash of his hand above his cauldron as he tipped something in. Draco inwardly winced as a puff of white smoke rose from Potter\u2019s cauldron.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, my boy, you\u2019ve almost got it!\u201d Slughorn swept over to Potter, giving Potter a pat on the shoulder. \u201cShame, shame. Go work with Mr. Weasley for the rest, don\u2019t you worry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter mumbled something back, but Slughorn shook his head\u2014a great theatrical move from Draco\u2019s position, but probably nauseating up close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Harry! Everyone makes mistakes. Now, Mr. Weasley\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s timer chimed in his mind, drawing his eyes back to his cauldron. The last traces of milky white dissipated and Draco removed the heat and completed the potion with three drops of the juice and seven slow anticlockwise stirs. A brilliant green colour initially trailed after Draco\u2019s glass stirring rod, before the potion settled on a transparent aquamarine.</p>\n<p>By the time Slughorn...<em>deigned</em> to visit Draco\u2019s workstation, Draco had bottled his potion and labelled it, table cleared. Draco kept his eyes on Slughorn\u2019s face, which was why he knew Slughorn did not even look at him. The professor glanced at the vial, muttered \u201cGood,\u201d and wandered back to the rest of the class.</p>\n<p>Draco discretely cast some shields before walking past the other students to put his vial on the front table. He was not hexed, this time, but that did little to stop the low bitterness at knowing that, once Slughorn saw the curled <em>Draco Malfoy</em> on the vial label, the potion would be dumped. Draco would have kept separate vials of the potions he made if it were not for the risk of being found and the likely accusations levelled against him.</p>\n<p>He had to walk past Potter and Weasley on his way out. Potter\u2019s eyes were partially blanked over, whilst Weasley\u2019s cheeks were red with frustration. Neither of them glanced at Draco.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco sat at his desk in the dorm room, pre-dawn. The room was blessedly empty\u2014Potter had been absent the entire night. Draco was almost worried though; he knew Potter wandered at night, but Potter always returned just an hour past midnight. Given that Potter was still out...there was a chance Potter would return whilst Draco was still in their shared rooms.</p>\n<p>It was Headmistress McGonagall\u2019s idea to put them together in the same eighth year dorm room. A large number of Eighth Years returned so that there simply wasn\u2019t enough room in the House dormitories. As such, McGonagall had converted the East tower into temporary accommodation, and in recognition that the Eighth Year students were adults, they were to room in pairs rather than in large groups. On the face of it, Draco was supposed to represent Slytherin, Potter Gryffindor. Perhaps she hoped for a leading example of house unity; Draco knew the students were waiting with bated breath either for his own demise, or for him to orchestrate Potter\u2019s.</p>\n<p>They were all wrong.</p>\n<p>The night of the Welcome Feast was the last time Draco had interacted with Potter in any way, when he and Potter had <em>politely</em> shook hands under McGonagall\u2019s sharp eye right after she announced their room allocations. Draco went up to the rooms first, whereas Potter stayed down in the common room with his fans.</p>\n<p>And that was it. Three weeks had past since: Draco kept out of the way, and Potter sneaked around Hogwarts late at night doing who-the-fuck-cares and the only time Draco saw Potter was in the Great Hall or in class. He knew Potter never looked back at him, always too busy with Granger and Weasley, or the atrociously large group of simpering fans. Draco reminded himself that <em>he</em> was too busy studying.</p>\n<p>Either way, they were not friendly, and they did not fight. They just had nothing to do with the other. It was better than Draco had hoped, honestly. With an even number of boys, Draco had no hope to obtaining a private room. Out of all the other boys, Potter was the least likely to kill him in his sleep; after all, what was the point of killing someone you had saved?</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>There was something, about Hogwarts after dark. In the day time, the world flashed, sound buzzed against Harry\u2019s ears. His face felt sore from smiling, and his eyes felt dry from keeping them open. There was always something to do, someone to talk to. If it wasn\u2019t Hermione and Ron, or maybe Ginny, or Neville, it was some other Eighth year who wanted to talk to him about some work, or duelling club members or Quidditch players asking for his advice, or girls forever trying to dose him on love potions.</p>\n<p>The night, however, held no expectations except Harry\u2019s quiet. Strips of pale silvery light lined the corridors, giving the impression of bars: confinement, repressing Harry\u2019s thoughts, keeping him away from the memories that lurked just below his eyes.</p>\n<p>It felt like a brief moment when Harry curled up on the window seat of the North Tower, wrapped up in his cloak. The grey of the night landscape made him doze, half awake.</p>\n<p>It was the slip into <em>dark-clash-bright</em> dreams that jolted Harry awake. Harry grimaced, sore from his folded up position. The sky was starting to streak yellow pink so he went back to the dorms.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It was almost six in the morning when Draco\u2019s wards pinged, and Potter entered the room.</p>\n<p>For a brief moment, Draco entertained the idea of ignoring Potter just like Potter had ignored him, but a desire to actually <em>see</em> Potter\u2014to make Potter see <em>him</em>\u2014made him twist in his seat to regard the Saviour.</p>\n<p>Potter had some parchment in one hand and the silky shimmering Invisibility cloak in the other. His eyes were heavy with tiredness but they widened when Draco faced him. Draco had a sudden feeling of something wrong: there was no dislike, hatred, or fire of self-righteousness in Potter\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Draco blinked, disoriented. How was he supposed to interact with Potter now? Sneer? Draco remembered Potter\u2019s words and actions at his trial\u2014extending not friendship but an agreement to be civil. Draco had been uncomfortable then, but Mother had prompted him to shake Potter\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p><em>Mother</em>. She would want him to be polite. <em>If it were not for Mr. Potter, we could all be in Azkaban, Draco</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco smoothed his face and greeted Potter with a curt nod. Potter responded with a nod of his own, but his eyes remained wide with surprise. Draco had no wish to pursue a silent conversation, so he turned back to his desk.</p>\n<p>There was some pattering around from Potter, before a <em>whumfp</em> as Potter collapsed onto his bed. When Draco left the room an hour later, Potter was asleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry was paired with Ron for Defence, as usual. Hermione had paired with Ginny. Professor Berriky had taught them two spells\u2014a temporary numbing curse and a concentrated shield spell\u2014and partners were to alternate casting. At the moment, Ron was casting the curse. Ron was casting it weakly though, and boredom struck Harry.</p>\n<p>He barely felt anything when his shield shattered. Ron gave a wordless shout, but Harry could muster only the tiniest bit of surprise as he fell.</p>\n<p>Harry heard the crack of bone and the crunch of cartilage, and he winced.</p>\n<p>Belatedly, as pain flooded into him, Harry realised the bone and cartilage was his. The pain as Harry\u2019s nose crushed against the ground reminded him of Malfoy\u2019s foot. Which made him wonder about Malfoy. What was Malfoy doing? That other morning was the first time Harry saw him since the Welcome Feast.</p>\n<p>Sound filtered back into Harry\u2019s ears as Ron turned him over, saying, \u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d over and over. The entire classroom was noisy as other students and Berriky surrounded him. At the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione, and he had a sudden airy feeling as he was lifted off the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Ron. Hazards of Defence,\u201d Harry said, watching as Ron\u2019s face slackened with relief.</p>\n<p>Berriky was saying something, but Harry focused on Hermione and Ron as they floated him out of the classroom.</p>\n<p>Hermione peered at him worriedly. \u201cHow are you feeling, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019fine.\u201d Harry tried a smile, but his nose hurt too much.</p>\n<p>Hermione gently shook her head, and Harry sensed doors opening before they entered into the white of the Infirmary. Somewhat dazed, he missed the weightlessness when Hermione lowered him onto a white bed. The sharp scent of blood replenishing potions preceded Madam Pomfrey as she swooped into Harry\u2019s field of vision.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfternoon, Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Harry mumbled.</p>\n<p>Pomfrey frowned, but it was weakened by her fond tone. \u201cMr. Potter, it must be impossible for you have a school year without getting hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d Hermione asked, leaning forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Potter will be able to return to his rooms tonight. Just be patient.\u201d Madam Pomfrey cast some quick spells. She left for a moment, returning with potions, which Harry dutifully drank.</p>\n<p>\u201cBroken nose and some small fractures. Lie back down, Mr. Potter.\u201d Madam Pomfrey raised her wand. \u201cThis will hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. When had healing <em>not</em> hurt? Ron, to his right, looked a bit pale as Harry\u2019s nose reverse-crunched back into shape, blanching at the snapping sounds as the bone fractures healed.</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey nodded in satisfaction. \u201cNow, Mr. Potter, you are to remain still. You\u2019ll be able to leave for dinner, but <em>not</em> before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry replied meekly.</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey shook her head, giving Hermione and Ron a level look. \u201cMs. Granger and Mr. Weasley, ensure that Mr. Potter gets his rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Madam,\u201d Hermione promptly answered. Madam Pomfrey took her leave as Hermione and Ron settled down on the chairs by the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, Ron, I\u2019m fine by myself,\u201d Harry said. It looked like Ron almost believed him, but Hermione definitely did not. \u201cYou should attend classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione stiffened, but in the end, they both stayed by his side.</p>\n<p>They talked about common things, sometimes just Hermione and Ron while Harry dozed, and sometimes the three of them. It made Harry yearn for those times when it was just them, just the three of them against the world\u2014not that he wanted the War or Voldemort back.</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey eventually returned and declared him healthy enough to leave. Hermione was still worried, and she stayed by his side during dinner, which consisted of him shifting food around his plate as he accepted the sympathy and <em>hope you\u2019re okay</em>\u2019s and told Ron that he was going to be a great Auror if he could defeat the \u2018great Harry Potter\u2019. Ron went red at that, whilst the rest of the table laughed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Back at the common room, Ron and Hermione exchanged glances, and Hermione didn\u2019t tell them to get out their homework. Instead, she placed a warm hand on Harry\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, maybe you should go straight to bed tonight,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked and turned to Ron, but Ron was nodding at Hermione\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>Guilt slugged through Harry\u2019s veins. He had worried his friends to the point that Ron didn\u2019t even make a joke about Hermione agreeing to <em>not </em>do work.</p>\n<p>Ron took a firm grip of his other arm. \u201cC\u2019mon mate, we\u2019re making sure you get rest tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry let them accompany him to his room. However\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Harry protested, embarrassed as Hermione helped him take off his shoes and outer robes, transfigured the rest of his clothes into pyjamas, and sent a cleaning spell to his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Harry</em>,\u201d Hermione huffed.</p>\n<p>Ron drew back Harry\u2019s bed curtains, lifting the blankets. \u201cIn ya go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little kid,\u201d Harry muttered, but Ron\u2019s earnest look kept him from rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about you, mate,\u201d Ron said, frowning. He tugged Harry forwards.</p>\n<p>Obediently, Harry climbed into bed and lay still as Hermione and Ron tucked him in. \u201cBut I <em>am</em> fine\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep, Harry.\u201d Hermione smoothed his hair, drawing his eyelids down.</p>\n<p>He must have been tired after all because he fell asleep immediately...with the image of Hermione and Ron standing by his bed, as though they were his parents.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The <em>screech</em> of Draco\u2019s innermost ward ripped Draco awake. The calming blue white of his dream shattered into the darkness of night. His hand grasped the wand under his pillow before his eyes even opened. The moonlight and his own moonstone gave enough light for him to point his wand at the intruder.</p>\n<p>The figure hovered by the corner of Draco\u2019s bed, on the window side where Draco kept the curtains opened. A muffled whimper-scream emerged, and Draco scrabbled backwards as the intruder\u2014person\u2014<em>POTTER!</em>\u2014collapsed onto the bed.</p>\n<p>Conspiracy scenarios and mean pranks filled the hysterical part of Draco\u2019s mind. The other part forced his breathing to even, to <em>examine</em>, to <em>listen</em>. Draco\u2019s eyes sharpened with a nonverbal spell, allowing him to make out Potter\u2019s face in the shadow of the silver light. Potter\u2019s eyes were closed and his mouth open, glistening saliva pooling at the corner.</p>\n<p>Once Draco\u2019s heart stopped drumming in his ears, he could make out Potter\u2019s even, deep breaths. Potter was asleep.</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes momentarily, but when he opened then again, Potter was still there. <em>Bloody Merlin</em>. He flicked his wand, levitating the git off his bed, himself rising from the warm covers. Potter\u2019s curtains were thrown back and his sheets messed up. Irritated, Draco deposited Potter on top of them.</p>\n<p>Draco was very much planning to leave Potter like that, but then the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Annoy just <em>had</em> to make a little mewling sound, shiver, and curl up. With bad grace, <em>which Mother will never learn of</em>, Draco properly tucked Potter into bed and cast a warming charm for good measure.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s shivers desisted, and any mewling faded.</p>\n<p>Barely refraining from childishly flicking Potter in the forehead, Draco turned back to his own bed, still warm. Exhaustion dragged Draco gratefully back to sleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Much to Draco\u2019s rising irritation, it was just under two hours later when he was forced awake <em>again</em>. It was the sound of screaming that woke him, and for a heart-stopping second, Draco thought it was him. He lifted his hand to his mouth, but it was closed, and the screaming continued.</p>\n<p>Draco pulled back his curtains with a flick of his wand. The room was empty, as far as he could see, aside from Potter. It was Potter who was screaming. Draco was torn between the urge to bury his head and wait out the screaming and the other, <em>insane</em> urge to go over and <em>calm</em> Potter. He wondered if the noise could be heard from outside.</p>\n<p>He wondered how likely it would be for the others to think it was his fault.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuckity-fuck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco threw back his blankets and moved quickly to the other bed. He waved his wand to re-tuck Potter in, neaten the bed and dry the sweat-soaked sheets. But Potter continued to scream, messing everything up again.</p>\n<p>He should just put a silencing charm up and leave Potter to his silent screams.</p>\n<p>\n<em>But what would Mother do?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco scowled. Given that Draco owed Potter a <em>number</em> of life-debts, she would insist Draco do something to help. To calm Potter, to ease his nightmares, if Draco were in such a position to do so.</p>\n<p>Draco placed a hand uncertainly on Potter\u2019s forehead. It was warm, but not feverish. Did he need to <em>talk</em> to sooth Potter? However, the screams wound down to pathetic whimpers.</p>\n<p>His hand on Potter\u2019s forehead covered the stupid scar. Without it, without that green gaze, Potter looked ridiculously innocent. Strands of black hair tickled at Draco\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>Steeling himself, Draco began to stroke Potter\u2019s forehead, Potter\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>The way the black hair parted between his fingers\u2014so pale in contrast\u2014was fascinating. And that it seemed to actually <em>work</em>, the whimpers and tremors easing, felt entirely surreal.</p>\n<p>A year ago, Draco didn\u2019t think he\u2019d live. How could he have <em>ever</em> imagined being in this kind of situation? Fighting each other for almost seven years, being on different sides in a fucking <em>war, </em>and now...Death Eater helping Golden Boy.</p>\n<p>Draco withdrew his hand the moment he realised that Potter was sleeping peacefully again. A <em>Tempus</em> told him it was less than an hour till his normal wake-up time, and it was with a longing resignation that Draco made an early start to his morning.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The sky suddenly turned dark, and Harry understood, at the back of his mind, that this was a dream. But it didn\u2019t stop the sudden welling of remembered fear. Black robes and pearly white masks. Harry ran, he tried to, but his limbs felt sluggish. They caught him\u2014did they in truth?\u2014and then it was Cruciatus all over. Harry tried to drag himself away, and for what felt like a brief moment, the pain stopped, and the sky was lightening\u2014and then it returned as Harry saw Cedric, saw him die over and over and over again\u2014</p>\n<p>Somewhere, Harry could <em>feel</em> it, was safety. Maybe just beyond the horizon\u2014and with a snap, he was <em>there</em>\u2014there in the white softness, and thank Merlin he couldn\u2019t see or sense any more Death Eaters\u2014it felt like time stretched and it was <em>forever\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Even in a dream, it was too good to last, and darkness descended and the walls closed in. His cupboard. A sudden panic hit him\u2014he was <em>too big </em>for his cupboard now! He pounded on the door, and it opened, revealing Aunt Petunia.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet to work, boy,\u201d she sneered, and Harry stumbled out of the cupboard gratefully. Only to watch in horror as Aunt Petunia morphed into Bellatrix, and she pointed her wand at him and <em>grinned\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Harry woke, almost jumping from his bed, wand drawn. His breathing was harsh in his ears, and it took just a brief second for the darkness of the dream to fade, to be replaced with the silver glow from the window and the golden <em>Lumos</em> from Malfoy\u2019s desk. Malfoy\u2019s head snapped towards Harry, wand raised. Harry suddenly felt stupid, and he dropped his wand arm. Malfoy\u2019s face smoothed, and he gave Harry a curt nod and turned away, leaving Harry to feel the emptiness where they usually traded insults.</p>\n<p>It was early, the sun barely risen.</p>\n<p><em>So this is when Malfoy does his work</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, limbs tired. His bed was mucked up, and the room felt entirely...blank. He quickly changed into his robes, packed his bag, and headed down early to the common room.</p>\n<p>The Eighth Year common room was large and round, with two roaring fireplaces on either side and two sets of stairs directly ahead that led to the dorm rooms. The banners of the four houses adorned the walls, but the room itself was furnished with muted browns and greens. The fires cast warm glows, and with no small relief, Harry curled up on one of the sofas.</p>\n<p>Hermione woke him up later, gently shaking him awake. \u201cHarry, breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry immediately reddened, having been caught. \u201cSorry, just woke up early, and I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione smiled exasperatedly, pulling him to his feet. \u201cC\u2019mon Harry, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Her glance flicked to the boy\u2019s staircase. \u201cRon will be coming down, raving for breakfast\u2014<em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>On cue, Ron was bounding down the stairs. \u201cHermione! Harry! Breakfast awaits! We have to get there before all the bacon is gone\u2014\u201d For a moment, he scowled. \u201cBloody Seamus tricked me yesterday. I\u2019m not going to fall for it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gave Harry a sly grin and looped her arm with Ron\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d she said, amusement colouring her tone.</p>\n<p>Harry found himself smiling as he followed them out.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Granger and Weasley had established a routine of putting Potter to bed every night. Sometimes, they quickly left; sometimes, they stayed and talked. If it weren\u2019t for Draco\u2019s well-reasoned paranoia, he would have put up silencing charms. As it was, he gritted his teeth and listened as the Golden Trio chattered about their boring day, filled with schoolwork, Quidditch and war charities.</p>\n<p>It seemed, however, putting Potter to bed stopped Potter from his normal midnight wanderings around Hogwarts. And in every one of those nights, Potter\u2019s subconscious had decided to walk into Draco\u2019s bed instead.</p>\n<p>Draco dragged himself awake <em>again</em> as Potter sleep-crawled onto his bed. Faintly, he realised that Potter was getting better at that\u2014he got his entire body on, and if Draco left it, Potter would probably figure out to sleep-snuggle under the covers. It felt almost routine to sweep Potter\u2019s blankets back, levitate Potter into his rightful bed, and tuck him in. For as long as it took for Potter to stop screaming, Draco let his hand run through Potter\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Draco itched to give Potter the modified Dreamless Sleep Draco made for Mother, but when he searched Potter\u2019s bedside table and found empty, old, vials of sleeping draughts, Draco knew he couldn\u2019t, at the risk of Potter getting an addiction; making something weaker wouldn\u2019t help. Though, it explained why Potter hadn\u2019t sleep-walked into Draco\u2019s bed earlier.</p>\n<p>And Draco could hardly give Potter his moonstone, or teach him how to use Occlumency to ward away dreams.</p>\n<p>Blearily, Draco fell back into own bed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco did not turn around and refused to pick up his pace. He did, however, curl his fingers around the wand in his pocket. He could hear the footsteps of maybe a dozen students behind. <em>Upstart Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink you\u2019re too good for us? You should be in Azkaban!\u201d One of the older boys yelled out. The sound bounced off the walls, leaving behind an echoing <em>aaazkaban-ban-ban</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s mind cooled. <em>Yes, and it was </em>your<em> Potter who kept me out</em>. Attending Hogwarts as an Eighth Year had been one of the terms of his probation. He supposed that it was the Wizengamot\u2019s idea of micro-aggression when they had been blocked from throwing Draco into a cell on a rock in the middle of the sea, handing over the law enforcement to school children who, by virtue of being on the \u2018Light\u2019 side, couldn\u2019t be at fault\u2014</p>\n<p>A spell whistled past his ear, clipping the edge of his shield.</p>\n<p>Anger bubbled up. Draco twisted around, whipping his wand out just as the rest of the group decided to cast. He narrowed his eyes, and with a sharp slash, sent the hexes crashing into the castle walls.</p>\n<p><em>Fucking kids think they can fucking get me. They fucking never had the fucking Dark Lord living in </em>their<em> homes</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Draco barely caught himself, a curse on the tip of his mind. One bloody scratch on any of them and he\u2019d be shunted back to Azkaban, and he bet these kids knew that. With an inward snarl, he clamped the anger down.</p>\n<p>The best he could do was cast the strongest shield he could and walk away as though spells weren\u2019t being aimed as his back. He did not give them the pleasure of flinching when a hex barrelled through and struck him in a star burst of pain, shattering his shield. He concentrated on forming another shield. Soon enough, they stopped, as Draco rounded the corner.</p>\n<p>He allowed himself a wince, then, and slipped into the nearest empty classroom. Shrugging off his robes, he probed the area around his lower back\u2014thankfully a place he could reach. After healing himself, he found no energy to put on his robes and exit the classroom. But he had too, and he emerged from the classroom when he was sure the corridor was empty.</p>\n<p>Draco slipped into the Eighth Year dorm behind Lovegood. The common room was filled with students in the space before dinner; mostly, they ignored Draco, as he ignored them. Potter was on one of the chairs by the fire, apparently holding court with his fellow fans. He looked like the righteous git he was, unlike that strangely innocent person in sleep. Which reminded Draco of his own lack of sleep.</p>\n<p>As such, tiredness decided for Draco to skip dinner, and he went straight to bed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For the first time in a while, Draco had an unbroken sleep. He woke from his green grass-blue skies dream without the sound of alarms in his ears. The room was quiet.</p>\n<p>He checked his detection wards. Granger and Weasley hadn\u2019t visited; Potter himself had only been in the room briefly late in the night. Potter had evidently returned to his night time wandering.</p>\n<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco stretched and got up, feeling his magic becoming more settled and calm already.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Mother\u2019s owl found him in the kitchens early Sunday morning. Draco had long stopped thinking about how the owls managed to get in or how they found him there. The Sunday <em>Quibbler</em> and <em>Daily Prophet</em> were already neatly folded beside his open books.</p>\n<p>He retrieved the letter and package from the eagle owl, Teithiwr. She permitted Draco\u2019s absent stroke before flying over to the treats dish the house elves had put down at the table.</p>\n<p>The package was opened first: a small box of chocolates, their scent and the box infused with Mother\u2019s magic. He didn\u2019t eat one, though, and closed the box, turning to the letter.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Draco traced the <em>Darling Draco</em> at the header of the parchment. It was just over a month before the first Hogsmeade weekend, when Draco could visit Mother. <em>And Father</em>, he supposed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Darling Draco,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>How are you, darling? It would please me greatly if you could find time to write to me more often, else I can only assume that your classes are proceeding well. I am afraid to say I cannot imagine the conduct of the other students and professors; I only hope that you have treated them with courtesy, and they in return.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, how I worry about how you are faring! Can you sleep well? Are the moonstones working?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>In regards to your room assignment with Mister Potter, I feel the need to remind you to keep your interactions pleasant and polite. I know you may feel anger, dislike, or discomfort in regards to Mister Potter, but you should see this as a chance. Regardless of whether or not Mister Potter understands the concept of debt, we do. It is best if you can fulfil those debts now, in case in the future, Mister Potter may forcefully call upon them.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Provide Mister Potter assistance, if necessary. It may be beneficial if you become closer than just acquaintances, if not friends. Darling, do not deny that you had, at least once, wished to be his friend. I cannot say I fully know your wishes now, but if that desire still exists, I wish for you to be able to fulfil that desire and gain a measure of contentment out of it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Enough of that. Your Father and I have completed the renovations of the West Wing and are starting on the East Wing. Your Father\u2019s house arrest, not surprisingly, has not been a hindrance. We send the house elves to retrieve any necessary items. Be careful if you do decide to visit Hogsmeade or any other wizarding areas, Draco. There are many who forget that we have been tried and acquitted.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have extended my hand to my sister, your Aunt Andromeda. Our meetings are warming; Teddy Lupin is an adorable baby, and you will definitely meet him over the Christmas holidays, if not during your visit next month. Teddy is a Metamorphmagus, a trait from his mother, your late cousin Nymphadora Lupin n\u00e9e Tonks. As yet, he shows no signs of inherited lycanthropy.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your Father is recovering, and I am sure that he will send you a letter soon. He sincerely wishes to heal the rift between you and himself. If nothing else, do it for me, Draco.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stay well, Draco. Keep your head up.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Love,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Mother.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco slowly folded the letter up and tucked it away. The box of chocolates sat invitingly in front of him, but Pansy and Blaise and Greg (<em>and Vincent</em>) weren\u2019t there for him to share or deny them of the chocolates.</p>\n<p><em>Stop being maudlin, Draco</em>, he berated himself. Teithiwr seemed to hoot in affirmation. Draco gave the bird a wry look and tried not to feel lonely in the smell of the chocolates and his mother\u2019s perfume.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It was moving onto the seventh day that Draco had an unbroken sleep. He woke from a calm-sea warm-beach dream without the sound of alarms in his ears. The room was quiet.</p>\n<p>Draco was uneasy.</p>\n<p>He checked his detection wards. Potter had only been in the room briefly during the night.</p>\n<p>With no one to hear, Draco let out a frustrated sigh. Potter had to ruin <em>everything</em>. The Boy-Who-Lived ruined Draco\u2019s sleep with his stupid sleepwalking and screaming and now made Draco fucking <em>worried</em> for the git. Draco didn\u2019t put it past Potter\u2019s subconscious to have some nefarious plan to slowly torture him.</p>\n<p>Potter had started to wander the night again, and he looked even more shit this time round. From afar, even Draco could see Potter\u2019s glazed eyes, his slouching gait, rumpled clothes, and messier-than-ever hair. It looked like Potter was catching snatches of sleep in uncomfortable places. He did not look as bad as during the War, Draco had to concede, but worse than a wizard on the Light side had the right to be.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next night, when Potter sleep-walked into Draco\u2019s bed, Draco was relieved. Staring at Potter, curled up at the side of Draco\u2019s bed, vulnerable\u2014<em>Merlin, if only Potter knew that he was at the mercy of an Death Eater</em>\u2014Draco lost the resolve to send Potter back to his own bed. Maybe Potter\u2019s subconscious realised the superiority of Draco\u2019s bed, which, after all, boasted Egyptian cotton and silk and offered the comforting view of the night sky.</p>\n<p>Maybe the world was offering Draco a way to pay his life debts.</p>\n<p>Decided, Draco retrieved and draped Potter\u2019s blanket over him and shuffled to the other side of the bed so that he wouldn\u2019t touch Potter accidently. He altered his wards, making Potter an exception, so that they\u2019d stop alerting Draco. A sense of satisfaction settled over Draco, and he went back to sleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco was puzzled. The landscape\u2014dark, cold, pale blue\u2014was not the image he had in mind when he fell asleep. He turned slowly. The air was frigid, even through the robes\u2014<em>robes?</em>\u2014he wore. The ground was little more than mucked up dirt, and the skeletons of trees broke the horizon.</p>\n<p>It looked like the War.</p>\n<p>The dream shifted suddenly to pitch darkness, confined space. Draco knew then that it<em> wasn\u2019t </em>his dream and realised he was rather lucid. Crying, wretched sobs and sniffling made his stomach coil, and he saw\u2014despite the darkness\u2014a young boy hunched up on the mattress. Draco knelt down, and then he could see the scar on the boy\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>The boy was Potter, and he was crying. It was Potter\u2019s dream.</p>\n<p>For a moment, panic gripped Draco as he could think of nothing.</p>\n<p><em>Mother\u2014what would she do?</em> The tiny corner of his mind ran through his memories, and the panic faded\u2014<em>six years old, after a nightmare, Mother sang</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes. It didn\u2019t do much\u2014darkness and darkness\u2014but it helped him recall the music, the words. He began gently, trying to channel his Mother, and a distant part of him felt and remembered. It was a lullaby his Mother made just for him, and by Black tradition, it was a song about the stars.</p>\n<p>In the dream, Draco\u2019s voice worked perfectly.</p>\n<p>It was a long song, but it took to the second repeat before little Potter stopped crying, and on the third verse, as Draco settled against the wall of the room more comfortably, that little Potter climbed into his lap, burying his face in Draco\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>As the last chorus faded on the third repeat, so did the dream.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco woke up, and his eyes blinked lazily. Somehow, during the night, Potter had shifted closer and captured Draco\u2019s hand. The dream was Potter\u2019s, and Draco knew enough of the feeling of dreams to know that it was at least <em>partly</em> true. Potter had dreamt of a room so small Draco could not stand straight in it, a mattress left on the ground, and a little Potter in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Draco put Potter back into his own bed before he could wake up and accuse Draco of something ridiculous; Draco cast a warming charm and tucked him in.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s face turned towards him, relaxed in sleep.</p>\n<p>Normal. Friendly even. Not the boy who rejected Draco\u2019s hand in First Year. Not the boy to whom Draco owed life debts. Not the boy who now barely ever looked at Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s stomach twisted, and he scowled and turned away.</p>\n<p>Harry took a slow breath, forcing his frown away. \u201cMelissa, point your wand at the dummies, not other students.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Friday night and the Great Hall was humid with the used air and body heat of over thirty students of the Duelling Club. Harry knew that Professor Flitwick and Neville were here <em>somewhere</em>, but it bloody felt like Harry was on his own. Melissa, a fourth year Gryffindor, nodded wisely at his words, but Harry had no doubt that she\u2019d forget and Harry would be shielding yet another student from a spell.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, sir? Can you help me with this?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Smile, Harry</em>.</p>\n<p>The entire day had felt weird: he had woken feeling distinctly <em>off</em> and much too early\u2014had done so for over a week. He had seen Malfoy again, quietly working at his desk. They just <em>exchanged nods</em>\u2014that\u2019s all! And when Harry thought he should say something, Malfoy just looked at him and made Harry feel stupid without even a smirk. Double Potions had been a disaster, and Harry felt absurdly sleepy during Transfigurations and just managed to scrape by without a detention.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned and nodded at the second year Hufflepuff. He cast his ninth <em>protego</em> and watched as the girl struggled through the spell. After her, a cluster of second years wanted another demonstration of the shield spell, and then Harry needed to go see the sixth years girls who appeared to be shooting glances at him and not undertaking much duelling practice, and bloody Zacharias Smith and Geoffrey Hooper were shooting childlish transfiguration spells at their dummy\u2014</p>\n<p>He spun round, startled as someone tapped him on the shoulder, wand rising.</p>\n<p>Neville smiled tiredly. \u201cBetter start winding down, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lowered his wand sheepishly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville nodded, and the Hall filled with his voice. It took a good ten minutes before the last students cleared though, as many of them wanted last minute advice. Ginny popped her head in as Harry, Neville and Professor Flitwick were setting the benches and tables back into place. Neville quickly hurried over to her, throwing Harry a good-bye.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and Harry?\u201d Ginny called. \u201cDon\u2019t forget Quidditch practice tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waved his hand. \u201cYeah, got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny waved cheerfully at him and Flitwick before dragging Neville away by his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood work, Harry,\u201d Flitwick said. The last table settled into place with a sweep of his wand. \u201cI\u2019ll be testing the fourth years next week. Some of them are ready to advance. Do you mind a short duelling demonstration in two weeks\u2019 time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cSure. Good night, Professor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flitwick nodded. \u201cGood night.\u201d Briskly, Flitwick headed out of the Great Hall, Harry quickly following behind. The doors creaked closed behind them.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Ron and Hermione were in the Eighth Year common room at one of the tables near the left fireplace. Hermione caught his eye almost immediately. <em>Homework</em>, she mouthed across the room. Harry nodded. He went quickly to his dorm room. The door opened at his magical signature, and Harry hurried over to his desk to retrieve his things.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s bed curtains were drawn up already, as always. A glance at Malfoy\u2019s desk found it completely empty. Harry frowned. He had <em>seen</em> Malfoy sitting there, working. More than once. Harry\u2019s own desk was currently a bloody mess. He quickly checked the Marauder\u2019s Map, and yes, Malfoy was indeed in bed.</p>\n<p>Harry exhaled. At least he wasn\u2019t hallucinating. He swept up his books and hurried back down to the common room.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him a pleased look as he plopped down next to Ron, who held a quill in one hand and a large cookie in the other. Ron gave him a muffled greeting and quickly ducked his head under Hermione\u2019s look. Harry immediately descended on his Transfigurations essay, due Monday, in three days\u2019 time. He knew Hermione would be satisfied if he completed it before last-minute-Sunday-night.</p>\n<p>Almost too soon though, Hermione stood up.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s end early,\u201d she said, blushing. \u201cIt <em>is</em> Friday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned, giving Ron a pointed look. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione rolled her eyes as she took Ron\u2019s arm. \u201cSleep well, okay, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Harry replied nonchalantly. \u201cYou both go up ahead. I just want to finish this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione touched his arm lightly. \u201cGood for you. Just, do sleep, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded back, lowering his eyes back to his work. A small part of him wished Hermione and Ron still accompanied him to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, mate,\u201d Ron quickly said, and he and Hermione disappeared up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Still feeling off, Harry eventually trudged into bed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco watched as an fat muggle man slapped little-Harry across the face after failing to produce perfect rashers of bacon. Harry was babbling, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p> The man snarled, booting Harry in the back of the knee. \u201cGo to your cupboard, boy! You\u2019re not allowed out until my say-so!\u201d</p>\n<p>The dream warped, as the cream-white door of a cupboard under the stairs loomed over them, then shrunk down to its normal size. The man, Vernon\u2014Draco had heard his name spoken in a previous dream\u2014opened the door with a bang and slammed it just as Harry slipped inside.</p>\n<p>As Draco was transported into the dark space, too small to stand in, Draco came to the horrible realisation that <em>this was Potter\u2019s room. </em>All around him, the words \u201cfreak\u201d and \u201cno one loves you\u201d bounced. Draco\u2019s heart nearly broke, because Mother would never do something like this, not to Draco, and even <em>Father</em> wouldn\u2019t dare, for all the hatred he contributed to, for all the jeopardisation of his own heir.</p>\n<p>Draco slumped down in the bed, drawing little-Harry into his lap. He sang the star lullaby again, until little-Harry stopped crying, until little-Harry stopped trembling, and sniffling.</p>\n<p>When Draco woke, Potter was curled against his front, somehow crossing the space between them during the night. The dried tear tracks made it all real, and Draco\u2019s stomach sank.</p>\n<p>At that moment, Draco sincerely hated himself. For all his supposed <em>intelligence</em> and <em>Slytheriness</em>, he had failed to collect correct information and instead had spouted whatever things matched his anger.</p>\n<p>Why hadn\u2019t Potter corrected him? Why had Potter <em>saved</em> him?</p>\n<p>Draco carried Potter back to his own bed and cleaned the tears with a wet flannel. Tucking Potter in felt ritualistic; he neatened out the covers, cast the warming charm, and for a brief moment, indulged in brushing his fingers lightly through Potter\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>And sighed.</p>\n<p>He was only doing this to cancel his debts to Potter. Nothing more would come of it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry woke up Saturday morning, yet again feeling distinctly weird. His blanket was still covering him, which was comforting but strange: it seemed that, this past week, Harry had yet to kick them off like he used to. It was even stranger to feel hungry, and there was a tune was stuck in his head.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled over to face the window\u2014and Malfoy\u2019s empty bed. It was past sunrise and the entire room\u2014east facing\u2014was awash with the golden light.</p>\n<p>It was odd. <em>A mystery</em>. Malfoy\u2019s desk, empty. Malfoy\u2019s bed, made, curtains pulled back. If it weren\u2019t for the smooth rocks on Malfoy\u2019s bedside table, and the trunk at the foot of the bed, and the clothes Harry supposed hung in Malfoy\u2019s wardrobe, Harry would had thought he was the only student in the room. It felt as though Harry would count his interactions with Malfoy since the war trials on just one hand.</p>\n<p>With a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, he took out the Marauder\u2019s Map and zeroed in on <em>Draco Malfoy</em>.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, Harry burst into the kitchens.</p>\n<p>The kitchens were bustling, house elves working tirelessly, air permeated with the heavenly scent of baking bread. Harry\u2019s eyes were immediately drawn to the calm: Malfoy, seated at a table off to the side.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was surprised to see him\u2014grey eyes widened almost comically, and his lips were twisting into a\u2014and then his face settled down to coolness. Malfoy gave Harry a curt nod, and he looked back down.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked, but Malfoy didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>No insults. Not even a smirk.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s face was blank, just like it was at the war trials when Malfoy had sat passively in front of the Wizengamot, awaiting his judgement. His face had gained <em>some</em> kind of emotion when Harry stepped up to speak; he offered a grudging thanks when Harry returned his wand and had narrowed eyes when Harry extended his hand.</p>\n<p>But now, it was emotionless.</p>\n<p>A motion drew his eyes away from Malfoy to the house elf in front of him. Winky blinked wide-eyed at Harry and wrung her hands. \u201cWould Master Harry be liking breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked briefly at Malfoy, whose head remained turned away. \u201cYeah, thanks, Winky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Winky nodded and led Harry to the table Malfoy was sitting at. Two other house elves set down some dishes and a cup and jug across the table and slightly to the side of Malfoy. Harry approached it a bit sheepishly\u2014he probably annoyed Malfoy, now that he was closer and noticed the spread of parchment and books. Malfoy didn\u2019t lift his head as he sat down, however, and Harry took that as a reluctant assent to silent company.</p>\n<p>As he ate, he listened to the bustle of the house elves, and the steady scratching of Malfoy\u2019s quill. There was a moment when he was suddenly fascinated by Malfoy\u2019s long fingers, articulating a precise, elegant handwriting. Harry winced, thinking about how the professors would have felt looking at his own handwriting. Malfoy\u2019s head shifted as he turned to one of his books, and Harry\u2019s eyes were caught by the pale blond hair that was long enough to partly curtain Malfoy\u2019s eyes. Malfoy\u2019s hair was no longer slicked back, but instead smooth and straight and somewhat curled around his ears.</p>\n<p>It was a little surprising when Harry realised he had finished eating. Malfoy was still working, not once meeting Harry\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Harry stood up, cringing as the chair squeaked. He looked at Malfoy again. \u201cUm, bye,\u201d he said, then quickly closed his mouth.</p>\n<p>Malfoy glanced up, (<em>yes!</em>), nodded (another <em>nod?</em>), and looked down. (<em>Oh</em>.)</p>\n<p>It was in the <em>slightest</em> haze of disbelief in which Harry thanked the house elves and wandered back to the Eighth Year common room.</p>\n<p>He had sat, with Malfoy, at the same table.</p>\n<p>For over fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>Without insulting or hexing each other.</p>\n<p>(Not that Malfoy spoke; not that Harry said much at all.)</p>\n<p>He almost ran the last stretch to the privacy of the dorm room to examine the Map. He couldn\u2019t help feeling vaguely disappointed in learning that Malfoy was still in the kitchens.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I need some reason to stay longer.</em>\n</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The moment Potter left the kitchens, Draco let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding.</p>\n<p>Now that Potter was gone, Draco allowed himself, just a little, to panic. <em>Why</em> did Potter come to the kitchens? <em>Why</em> did Potter sit down at the table? And <em>why</em> did Potter stare at him the entire time?</p>\n<p>Draco warily touched his hair, but it was still perfect.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Did Potter find out about the sleepwalking?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco stilled. <em>What if he did?</em></p>\n<p>Potter had not confronted him about anything, however, and had said very little. Draco deduced that Potter had not found out, and if Draco could have his way, Potter wouldn\u2019t ever.</p>\n<p>But Draco knew his luck, or lack thereof. If he continued letting Potter sleep in his bed, Potter <em>will</em> find out. And Draco wasn\u2019t bloody optimistic enough to believe that Potter would see the \u201cgood\u201d side of what Draco was doing.</p>\n<p>The only solutions Draco could think of was to return Potter to his own bed; or to set up wards that kept Potter away.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Before bed, Draco placed repelling wards in the space between the foot of his bed to the nearest far-wall; his curtains, to Potter\u2019s side, were charmed tightly shut.</p>\n<p>However, Draco was woken when Potter collapsed on the floor just outside his wards. The git just curled up on the floor, and Draco gave in to the urge to rub his eyes. Gritting his teeth, he levitated the git back to not-Draco\u2019s-bed, dumping the sleeping Saviour on the messed up sheets, before resolutely returning to his own bed.</p>\n<p>Draco was not surprised when he was prematurely forced awake only a few hours later to find Potter slumped at the base of his bed.</p>\n<p><em>Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck</em>YOU<em>, Potter. You just </em>have<em> to make it hard for me, don\u2019t you?</em></p>\n<p>Draco glared at him, slobbering over the floor. The <em>cold</em> floor. Reluctantly, Draco got up from bed, dispelled the repelling wards, scooped Potter up, and put him down on his bed.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s breathing settled.</p>\n<p><em>Fucking Potter and fucking world. You better give me good luck for all this, and please don\u2019t kill me. </em>Draco felt like laughing at his own stupid plea.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry woke, tired, irritated and a bit sore. He was too late to catch Malfoy, with the sun streaming brightly through the windows.</p>\n<p>At breakfast, Harry had no appetite for chewing, and the porridge felt like flavourless paste in his mouth. Instead, he nursed a cup of coffee as his eyes shifted to the Slytherin table. It was a sparse house this year, the students sitting in tight clusters of mixed years. But Harry couldn\u2019t see Malfoy.</p>\n<p>It <em>was</em> a Sunday, and most students slept in, but he had seen Malfoy up before the sun even rose\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the back of his mind, Harry winced, belatedly realising that he'd just cut into Hermione\u2019s talk, which he hadn\u2019t been paying attention to. However, Hermione turned to him with questioning eyes, no trace of anger or irritation on her face.</p>\n<p>He blinked sheepishly. \u201cHave you seen Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron spluttered on his bacon. \u201cWhy\u2019r\u2019asking us? Isn\u2019t he your dorm mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gave a little exasperated shake of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting obsessed with him <em>again</em> now, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cCourse not!\u201d he protested. \u201cI just...realised that I never actually <em>see</em> him in the room. I think only at classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gave Harry a steady look. \u201cIn that case, I probably see him more than you,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cHe takes Runes and Arithmancy, as well as Defence and Potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. He couldn\u2019t recall seeing Malfoy in Defence <em>or</em> Potions. Harry shrugged under Hermione\u2019s gaze. \u201cSorry, you were talking about\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes brightened and she launched back into her talk.</p>\n<p>If Malfoy did his work in the kitchens in the morning, he probably ate breakfast there too. <em>It\u2019s not a bad idea, actually</em>\u2014it would mean Harry could <em>eat in peace</em>, rather than be talked to, talked about, have letters rained upon his head, and asked for yet another autograph (at least he now charged per autograph\u2014Ron thought it would be a good idea to donate it to the War Orphans fund). Harry felt a plan form in his head.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry almost jumped up with success when he saw Malfoy at lunch, sitting at the end of the Slytherin table nearest to the professors. Malfoy sat straight backed and had a cool expression on his face. There was an almost visible circle surrounding Malfoy that the other students avoided, skirting around him. The way Malfoy ate was fascinating; neatly, quickly, but with a <em>grace</em>. At times, Malfoy\u2019s eyes idly swept the Hall, and once, Harry accidentally met his gaze. Malfoy kept staring at him, and feeling a bit uncomfortable for having been caught looking, Harry hesitantly tipped his head. Malfoy looked just a bit startled, but he quickly returned the nod and broke eye contact.</p>\n<p>After that, Harry made sure to look away when Malfoy\u2019s eyes started to wander near him. But it was after one of those times that, when Harry looked back, Malfoy had already left.</p>\n<p>Dinner was an eerie repeat of lunch: Malfoy, end of the table, invisible barrier around him, with Harry trying not to meet his eye. Malfoy left as soon as he finished eating, and Harry itched to chase after him, to follow him to their room.</p>\n<p>Harry waited with barely concealed impatience for Hermione and Ron to finish eating. Or maybe, not very concealed at all:</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, what\u2019s gotten in to you?\u201d Hermione asked across the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cErr\u2014\u201d Harry spluttered. He looked down at his plate, barely eaten. \u201cJust feeling tired,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave a non-committal \u201cHmm,\u201d and looked to Ron. Harry followed her gaze: Ron was still eating, and after a few seconds, he slowly looked up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhmmapf?\u201d Ron questioned.</p>\n<p>Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron but placed a fond hand on his arm regardless. She turned back to Harry. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back first then? Straight to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2014okay.\u201d Harry stood up quickly and felt nauseous. \u201cYeah, bed,\u201d he agreed weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it gets bad, we can take you to the Infirmary,\u201d Hermione added, frowning.</p>\n<p>Harry tried to smile reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione shot him a smile and Ron mumbled an absent \u201cGood night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was almost used to the chorus of \u201cBye, Harry,\u201d from the Gryffindor table as he left. He waved back, the most he could do while not emptying his stomach on the floor.</p>\n<p>The corridors were blessedly empty, and Harry slipped into the common room without any fuss from the guardian portrait. The dorm seemed empty, as he crossed the common room, climbed up the stairs and made his way to his room.</p>\n<p>Harry paused with his hand on the door handle. There was light under the door, and Harry fought to keep the nausea and excitement from mixing.</p>\n<p>Harry opened the door.</p>\n<p>His eyes immediately fixed upon the motion in the room\u2014the bathroom door was simultaneously opening and Malfoy appeared in a white shirt and trousers, contrasting starkly against the darkness of the bathroom behind him.</p>\n<p>Malfoy startled, flinching back and eyes widening. His wand appeared in his hand, warily raised, all before thought returned to Harry\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>It struck Harry how similar, yet how different, it was from sixth year. He quickly backed a step, facing his palms up. \u201cFuck, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s eyes narrowed. He didn\u2019t tuck his wand away, but his hand lowered. Very slowly, whilst still pinning Harry with his gaze, Malfoy shut the bathroom door.</p>\n<p>Harry squirmed a bit and fully stepped into the room, closing the door behind him. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to bed?\u201d <em>Oh, great, Harry, what the fuck did you just say?</em></p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he tilted his head slightly in acknowledgement and padded across the room\u2014past Harry\u2014to his bed on the far window side. The bed was already partially curtained; Malfoy pulled shut the curtains facing Harry\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>Harry was still rooted at his spot by the door when Malfoy looked back at him. And met his eyes.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t a Great Hall between them this time, nothing to let Harry pretend that he hadn\u2019t been watching Malfoy.</p>\n<p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and Harry\u2019s automatic reaction was to scowl back. He stepped away from the door and away from Malfoy, towards his own bed and trunk. Head turned away, he muttered a \u201cGood night.\u201d The slide of curtain rings ended their non-conversation.</p>\n<p>Harry readied for bed quickly, nausea now a solid press against his eyes. Harry dropped his glasses carelessly on the bedside table and muttered his usual silencing charms. He'd deal with Malfoy another day. The headache pulled him into a restless sleep.</p>\n<p>Harry had dreamt of the cupboard again. But...he wasn\u2019t alone. There was someone else there, someone with long limbs and a firm chest. Even now, Harry could feel the hum as that chest resonated with sound. He couldn\u2019t remember all the words, just snatches\u2014<em>I\u2019ll place the stars for you</em>\u2014but Harry liked it. It sounded nice.</p>\n<p>He had woken after the sun rose, nausea gone. The room had been bathed in golden light and, for a while, Harry felt that it truly reflected his mood: optimistic. His nightmares weren\u2019t as bad, and he had <em>slept the entire night</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cMate, what are you humming?\u201d Ron asked from the next desk over in Potions. Hermione was on his other side, and she gave Ron an exasperated look before returning to scanning her potions text.</p>\n<p>Harry looked up, grinning, still humming. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Stuck in my head though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Ron\u2019s potion bubbled and he cursed, quickly focusing back. Harry, however, noticed Malfoy walking up to the front of the class and placing his vial on the table. There was still half an hour left, which was startling. Even Hermione noticed Malfoy\u2019s quick finish, because she was frowning more than ever.</p>\n<p>Malfoy noticed him and gave him a nod before slipping out of the classroom without a word. Bewildered, Harry glanced to Slughorn, but the professor hadn\u2019t noticed, despite standing at one of the desks near the door. Slughorn noticed <em>Harry</em> looking at him though, and he swept over, chattering loudly about <em>how good</em> Harry\u2019s progress was. Harry frowned inwardly.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Harry woke up early enough to catch Malfoy still working at his desk, he virtually jumped out of bed, startling Malfoy, who almost jumped out of his chair.</p>\n<p>Giddy with the success of getting another reaction out of Malfoy, Harry couldn\u2019t help grinning when Malfoy gave him that emotionless stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said belatedly, but a quick glance at the windows, \u201c\u2014or, umm, not really morning yet, but\u2014\u201d and <em>fuck yes!</em>, the left corner of Malfoy\u2019s lips quirked up, just a bit. Harry\u2019s grin increased.</p>\n<p>Starting to realise how weird it was to be smiling, he ducked his head, as Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned back to his desk.</p>\n<p>Feeling mighty pleased with himself, Harry hummed his way through his shower. It looked like sleeping early meant sleeping well, and Harry had the hope that he could now farewell sleepless nights.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry emerged from the bathroom to find Malfoy packing his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy\u2014\u201d Harry started, before he could think.</p>\n<p>Malfoy turned round, brow arched in question.</p>\n<p>\u201cErm, going to the kitchens? Can you wait for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy regarded him, probably searching for malicious intent, but Harry was quite sure he didn\u2019t have any, not anymore.</p>\n<p>Slowly, Malfoy nodded. Harry gave a relieved smile, to which Malfoy quirked the corner of his mouth at.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry wanted to hug all the house elves who set the table, seating them across from one another. And when Malfoy finished eating and took out his work, Harry could triumphantly take out his work too.</p>\n<p>Malfoy stared. Harry smiled sheepishly, running an absent hand through his hair. Malfoy eventually gave up with a quiet huff, and Harry was able to start earnestly on his homework.</p>\n<p>In fact, Harry was doing his work <em>so</em> earnestly that he was shocked when a large owl swooped into the kitchens and landed on the table with a whoosh of wind. Malfoy, Harry immediately noticed, was unfazed. Turned away from Harry, Malfoy <em>actually</em> gave a quiet hum as those long, pale fingers ruffled the owl\u2019s feathers. The bird nipped back and Malfoy ducked his head slightly, quickly removing the items.</p>\n<p>With another gust of wind, which had Harry scrambling to keep his parchments down, the owl flew to the other side of the kitchens where the house elves immediately started to fuss over the bird. It was an endearing sight.</p>\n<p>He turned back to see Malfoy leafing through a newspaper. Harry scowled. <em>The bloody Daily Prophet</em>. At Harry\u2019s relief, Malfoy quickly tucked it away as he settled into reading the <em>Quibbler</em> instead.</p>\n<p>Harry cast a <em>Tempus</em>\u2014and realised that Hermione and Ron would be waiting for him to come to breakfast. Guiltily, he sent off his Patronus and quickly started clearing up his things.</p>\n<p>\u201cI err\u2014\u201d Harry started, and he quickly gained that unreadable grey gaze, \u201cerr...see you later, Malfoy. Hermione and Ron are waiting for me\u2014\u201d Harry cut himself off. He doubted Malfoy would care why he was leaving.</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded silently and returned to his work, a clear dismissal. His face was blank again, showing none of the liveliness Harry had seen just a few minutes ago. For a moment, Harry wanted to be contrary and sit back down again regardless. More than that though, he had already told Hermione and Ron he\u2019d meet them in the Great Hall. Harry shook his head, and left Malfoy to the company of house elves and a bird.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Harry woke up early enough, he let himself follow Malfoy to the kitchens for an early breakfast. But he was never able to startle Malfoy by jumping out of bed suddenly. Malfoy didn\u2019t quirk his lips, stopped rolling his eyes, and definitely did not scowl. Those mornings quickly became an agonising wait for the giant owl to come to deliver whatever it delivered: it was the only time Harry saw Malfoy\u2019s face soften from blankness. Once, the bird had even nuzzled Malfoy and Malfoy had had the barest of smiles.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the attention Malfoy bestowed on the owl, and even the house elves, Harry was ignored; <em>he</em> only received tiny nods of acknowledgement at the start of the day, and after the owl arrived and Harry had to rush off to meet his friends.</p>\n<p>Harry needed to do something else. Something different. He <em>needed</em> to get Malfoy to <em>speak</em>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Potter started accompanying Draco to the kitchens for breakfast, for \u2018study\u2019. However, he always left a bit early, to go to his <em>actual</em> friends Granger and Weasley, and it left Draco a bitter taste.</p>\n<p>Despite his apparent overtures of \u2018friendship\u2019, Potter never approached Draco in view of others.</p>\n<p>And yet, every night without fail, Potter stumbled, eyes closed and asleep, into Draco\u2019s bed. Unconsciously trusting <em>Draco</em>, curling under the blankets and sleeping as though it was <em>safe</em>. Surely Potter could sleepwalk to Weasley\u2019s bed? Or Granger\u2019s?</p>\n<p><em>Maybe I\u2019m just the closest source of warmth</em>, Draco thought sardonically.</p>\n<p>He had written to Mother about the dreams. She hadn\u2019t found much about entering others dreams\u2014she mentioned the possibility of hallucinations and legilimency, and she suspected there might be a potion or blood magic that could achieve what Draco had asked her about. She promised to continue searching through their libraries, and had set Father to the task as well. There was a conspicuous lack of her asking <em>why</em> Draco wanted to know this, but if she didn\u2019t ask, Draco will not tell.</p>\n<p>In the morning when Teithiwr arrived with Pansy\u2019s and Blaise\u2019s and Greg\u2019s letters, Draco was filled with warmth and relief\u2014tempered only slightly by Potter\u2019s presence, which always disappeared after Teithiwr came. He'd wait til after classes to open and savour them, but the promise of the letters became something that kept him going through the day.</p>\n<p>After dinner, in the privacy of his bed, he opened the letters. Pansy and Blaise both attended Beauxbatons, spared from the Wizengamot\u2019s revenge. Draco was pleased they were doing well\u2014assuming that they hadn\u2019t lied in the letters like he might have done. They had sent him some star stones, and Draco placed them together with his moonstone. Greg had forgone education of the academic sort and had gone straight into his Ministry probation hours, working at that dragon reserve in Romania. Draco thought that maybe after the uncontrollable Fiendfyre, dragon fire might appear rather tame. Greg sent him more pictures than words, but Draco appreciated them as much as Pansy\u2019s and Blaise\u2019s. A smile was unfamiliar on his facial muscles, and he tucked away the letters and photos in his bedside table to reply to in the morning.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mr. Malfoy.</em>\u201d Professor Berriky\u2019s voice, low and thunderous, was an undercurrent in the noisy Defence room as the other students practised their spells. But Harry heard.</p>\n<p>He immediately stilled, motioning for Ron to do the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy, why haven\u2019t you a partner <em>again</em>?\u201d Berriky was saying, folding her arms. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you practice. I will <em>not</em> have slackers in my class!\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy met her gaze evenly but did not speak.</p>\n<p>Berriky had her wand in her hand.</p>\n<p><em>Just fucking talk, Malfoy!</em> Harry wanted to yell.</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t open his mouth. Instead, he half turned, making a mirror appear near the wall away from the others. With a duellist\u2019s grace, he cast every attack spell they\u2019d learnt and every defence spell as the attack spells came ricochetting back.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d Ron asked, following Harry\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry breathed, \u201cshould be in the Duelling club.\u201d They both watched as the final sparks of magic faded away and the mirror vanished.</p>\n<p>Berriky was frowning though. \u201cThink you\u2019re so good then? Then leave. You obviously don\u2019t need any help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded, calmly picking up his things. He met Harry\u2019s\u2014and Ron\u2019s\u2014look and arched a brow at them before sweeping out of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, Ron,\u201d Hermione reprimanded. \u201cPay attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned away from the door, but he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. \u201cBut, Malfoy\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny looked at Harry, then Hermione, puzzled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy just left class,\u201d Ron answered.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s mouth pressed into a thin line, briefly turning to watch Berriky aid another pair of students.</p>\n<p>Ginny shrugged. \u201cSo what?\u201d Her eyes started to sparkle. \u201cOhh, don\u2019t tell me Harry\u2019s starting to stalk him again?\u201d she teased.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Harry protested. He shooed them with his hands. \u201cGet back to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione finally spoke. \u201cMalfoy can\u2019t have a partner. There is an odd number of people in the class.\u201d She turned back to Ginny to recommence practice and Ron shrugged, turning back to Harry and readying his wand.</p>\n<p>But <em>Harry</em> couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Oh, he pushed it away enough to focus on casting and defending, but Hermione\u2019s words kept repeating.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Malfoy can\u2019t have a partner.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Malfoy <em>never</em> had a partner this entire year. Harry had never seen Malfoy with <em>anyone</em> since the start of the school, and given how limited Harry\u2019s \u2018interactions\u2019 with Malfoy were, he wasn\u2019t certain that his company counted.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was the only Eighth Year Slytherin to return. Malfoy was alone, aside from the owl, aside from the house elves. Had Parkinson and Zabini and Goyle abandoned him?</p>\n<p>And then Harry thought of something he could do.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Part one was to <em>stay</em> rather than leave the moment Harry got a glimpse of not-blank Malfoy. He had already warned Ron and Hermione not to wait for him in the morning. Hermione gave him a strangely knowledgeable look, but Ron was easily convinced with the idea that Harry wanted an early breakfast in the kitchens.</p>\n<p>Malfoy narrowed his eyes the moment he realised Harry wasn\u2019t going to jump up and leave. Harry shrugged back, hopefully a picture of nonchalance and returned to completing his homework.</p>\n<p>And then, when Malfoy stood up to leave for their first class\u2014Harry stood up too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have Potions first together, so I may as well go with you, right?\u201d Harry said lightly.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked at him as though he was barmy.</p>\n<p>Harry shifted nervously on his spot. If this plan didn\u2019t work, the next part wouldn\u2019t even start. \u201cEr, you know that awkward thing where you\u2019re both walking to the same place and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy's eyes flickered away, and he gestured Harry to follow.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned.</p>\n<p>They were ahead of the rush to classes, so it was mostly industrious Ravenclaws that walked the corridors. Slughorn was not yet present at the Potions classroom and the door was locked. After giving Harry an unreadable look, Malfoy leaned back against the wall in wait. Given the flinch, Malfoy was surprised when Harry went to stand next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, have you prepared for class yet?\u201d Harry eventually said.</p>\n<p>Malfoy inclined his head slightly, but said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t <em>get</em> potions sometimes,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cI bet the bloody subject\u2019s half sentient and out to get me.\u201d He quickly glanced at Malfoy and saw the corner of his mouth twitching.</p>\n<p>They stood in silence. When others started arriving, Malfoy darted him a look but did nothing otherwise. Eventually, Slughorn appeared.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotions, first thing in the morning,\u201d he said happily. \u201cEarly today, eh, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quickly realised that Malfoy had already slipped into the room, leaving Harry to face Slughorn alone. \u201cEh\u2014yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Slughorn continued cheerfully.</p>\n<p>The other students streamed in, and Hermione snagged his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was breakfast?\u201d she quickly asked.</p>\n<p>Ron gave him a narrow look, interjecting, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Malfoy we saw, was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Harry replied innocently. \u201cI was just hanging out. He <em>is</em> my dorm mate, just like you said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron grunted. \u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Professor McGonagall want inter-House cooperation?\u201d Harry persisted.</p>\n<p>\u201cClass, today we will be\u2014\u201d Slughorn's voice rolled through the room.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes widened and she quickly turned to the front, forcing Ron to as well. Harry settled back into his seat in relief.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco felt the slightest warmth when Potter remained in the kitchens with him for the second time, instead of running off to see Granger and Weasley.</p>\n<p>And Potter continued doing so the entire week. Draco was wary of Potter thinking Draco was some <em>charity case</em> but it was hard not to feel <em>vindicated</em> that Potter was finally becoming...something like a friend.</p>\n<p>He distinctly felt the eyes of the other students on them when he and Potter walked to class together and, <em>Merlin</em>, he gloated inside. Draco could afford to relax his guard slightly, because even <em>they</em> weren\u2019t naive enough to confront Draco in the presence of their Saviour.</p>\n<p>It seemed that even Professor Berriky had caught wind of the non-antagonistic something between him and Potter, because she only gave him a narrowed gaze and left him to silent reading in class whilst the other students paired up.</p>\n<p>When Draco decided to muse on this strange new state of his life, he realised that it felt a lot like optimism.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry woke on Monday with a different song in his head. It was different from the solemn song about stars\u2014this one was light and quested for blue skies and fluffy white clouds in the shape of dragons. Which was good because he had dreamt of Dementors.</p>\n<p>Malfoy sat by his desk, and the juxtaposition of golden <em>Lumos</em> and silver moonlight made his hair ethereal, the colours shifting as Harry moved his head. When it was time to go, Malfoy waited patiently as Harry stuffed his books into his bag. The house elves had set their breakfasts next to each other, instead of across the table, and while Harry was uncomfortable about it, Malfoy just quirked his lip and sat down. Harry felt the insane urge to mimic Malfoy\u2019s movements.</p>\n<p>Monday meant a Potions practical and a due-in homework assignment, so Harry took out his textbook and his own potions reference text alongside his assignment, which had only been halfway completed\u2014Hermione had <em>not</em> been happy about that.</p>\n<p>It was when Harry was glaring at the last question, in between frantically searching his texts, that Malfoy gave a sigh. Shoving Harry\u2019s hands away, Malfoy flicked through the textbook himself. He placed the book in front of Harry and tapped one of the passages. Harry blinked and stared and frowned at Malfoy. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve read that already\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy arched an eyebrow and directed his gaze back to the book, as his pale finger slid to a certain sentence and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry bit his lip, flushing. Harry looked up again. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy rolled his eyes and made a shooing motion.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201c<em>Gryffindork</em>,\u201d he supplied for Malfoy.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s eyebrows shot up. Harry carefully kept his open expression. After a moment, Malfoy made a quiet sound and his lips quirked up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Harry replied, mock indignant. \u201c<em>Oh, and </em><em>I suppose Potions </em>books <em>are out to foil you, too.</em>\u201d Harry continued, trying to affect Malfoy\u2019s drawl. \u201c<em>Saviour of the Wizarding world, </em><em>defeated</em><em> by a mere book</em>.\u201d Harry shook his head in exaggerated disapproval.</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t laugh, but his eyes brightened.</p>\n<p>Their walk to the morning Potions class was <em>finally</em> starting to feel companionable. Slughorn greeted Harry with a brash, \u201cHello, Harry!\u201d and completely ignored Malfoy.</p>\n<p>Malfoy glanced at Slughorn. Giving Harry a tiny smirk, he slipped into the room, leaving Harry to fend for himself again.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, Harry was only a little bit startled with the owl flew into the kitchens. Malfoy lifted his head, and suddenly Harry was stuck staring at the slightest <em>smile</em> as Malfoy retrieved the letters and packages. Malfoy opened the largest package\u2014a box made of dark wood. After glancing to Harry, Malfoy made a show of opening it. The smell of rich chocolate immediately flooded Harry\u2019s senses, and he realised that this was one of many packages Malfoy\u2019s mum sent him. Malfoy nudged him out of his stupor with a raised eyebrow and made an offering motion to the box.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, have one?\u2014<em>Obviously, Potter</em>,\u201d Harry answered himself. Harry opened his palm. \u201cYou first, Malfoy.\u201d Harry arched his brow in imitation of Malfoy. \u201c<em>Why, Potter, you </em>do <em>have manners.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy rewarded him with smirk, and he picked a dragon shaped chocolate and shifted the box towards Harry. Harry looked inside and was surprised. The box had what Harry assumed were layers of trays. Chocolates nestled in shaped indents, and there were lions! He immediately picked <em>that</em> one.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned, making him unable to arch his eyebrow, but nonetheless\u2014 \u201c<em>Why, how Gryffindor of you, Potter</em>\u2014You wouldn\u2019t have eaten the lion anyway! <em>Snakes eat lions for breakfast, don\u2019t you know?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Given Malfoy\u2019s upturned lips, he approved of Harry\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p>They settled back to work, and well, Harry felt for the first time that they really <em>were</em> friends.</p>\n<p>The note that accompanied the box had said,</p>\n<p>\n<em>To be shared. Love, Mother.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And the moment Draco saw the lion-shaped chocolates in the box that Mother sent him, he knew that he should talk to her properly about his relation with Potter.</p>\n<p>He knew that she knew something. He hadn\u2019t written to her about his emerging...friendship with Potter, but he had read about it in the <em>Prophet.</em> There had to be student spies at the school, ones <em>obsessed </em>with Potter and everything he did. That Draco being seen around with Potter made the news was hardly surprising, and sometimes Draco wondered why there weren\u2019t articles like \u201c<em>Harry Potter, attending Potions class!\u201d,</em> or <em>\u201cHarry Potter eats pancakes for breakfast!\u201d,</em> or other such rot.</p>\n<p>Draco placed the letters and other packages to the side, and presented the box to Potter. Potter did his amusing talking thing, and Draco picked out a dragon, and Potter his lion (<em>Gryffindor</em>). They shared minutes of pleasant silence as they consumed their chocolates. Draco found himself unwillingly smiling a little at Potter\u2019s wide grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank your mum for me, Malfoy,\u201d Potter said easily, licking off his fingers. \u201c<em>Alright</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco allowed himself to roll his eyes, somewhat at Potter\u2019s answer for him, but also because he <em>will</em> thank his mother.</p>\n<p>Potter stretched luxuriously, and after flicking Draco another grin, settled back to his work. Draco blinked at the sudden warmth that filled him. He shook his head clear his mind, and tried not to smirk when Potter dripped ink all over his parchment on accident and cursed to himself.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">That night, Draco set the letters and packages around in a circle on his bed. He picked up Mother\u2019s letter\u2019s first, the scent of flowers clinging to the paper. Mother\u2019s letter did not include any explicit reference to Potter. Instead, she reminded him to visit the Manor during the upcoming Hogsmeade weekend and to write to Father. Even Father had written to Draco but the lightness of the entire letter\u2014a bland and thorough rendition of the renovation works at the Manor\u2014left Draco no doubt that Mother had been looking over Father\u2019s shoulder as he wrote it.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed as he unravelled the package that Father had sent. <em>Perhaps Father isn\u2019t as inattentive of me as I thought</em>. A small silver pendant was revealed, nestled in dark blue velvet. The chain was white silver, made of tiny delicate links, and when Draco touched the pendent with a tentative finger, a shiver of magic curled up his arm.</p>\n<p>The pendant was infused with defence magic. It was old, and layers and layers of interlocking spells lay just at the surface of the metal, sliding along the chain links. Slowly, Draco undid the clasp and put the pendent around his neck. The moment the chain was clasped, the pendent hummed and the tingle of magic flowed over his skin.</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes. There was a newer spell he could sense. Father\u2019s magic. It did not have the same <em>safe</em> feeling of Mother\u2019s, but there was a sense of stoicism and that...Father cared. Draco was able to undo some of his own personal defence spells, and he sighed the strain of maintaining spells decreased.</p>\n<p>Pansy\u2019s and Blaise\u2019s joint package was a much lighter tone; they had given him some French hair potions. Pansy assured him that they were <em>at least as good as Sleakeezy's, darling</em>.<em> Think how utterly </em>amazing<em> French fashion is, Draco!</em> Pansy\u2019s and Blaise\u2019s banter across the letter\u2014different sections in different handwriting and the occasional blot as they fought over the quill\u2014had Draco nostalgic. He decided then to write to Mother to see if Pansy, Blaise, and Greg would be able to come over to the Manor during the Hogsmeade weekend as well.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry saw a mirror, unlike the mirror Malfoy had cast during Defence. <em>This </em>was the Mirror of Erised, and Harry saw his reflection: a small, short boy, messy hair, too-big clothes.</p>\n<p>As Quirell clutched his arm, he felt himself freeze, and burn, and scream. Voldemort\u2019s voice curled around him like poisonous gas. He couldn\u2019t shake off the grip and the Stone knocked back-forth in his pocket as he tried to get away. His scar burned as Quirell burned.</p>\n<p>Warmth blossomed across his back, and he feared that it was Fiendfyre. He twisted his head and just caught the glimpse of blond hair before black robes swathed him, drawing him away. Harry turned back to Quirell and Voldemort, and his eyes widened as he watched a copy of himself stand there as the memory played out and Quirell crumbled. The person kept him warm, and slowly, Harry could hear the words the stranger was quietly singing\u2014\u201c<em>For you, I\u2019ll give you the moon\u201d</em>\u2014and Harry finally relaxed in the embrace.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The bitterness towards Dumbledore for letting him suffer <em>that</em> contrasted sharply with the song still in his head. He was a fucking<em> child </em>when he had seen death; the stone, the basilisk\u2014fuck, even <em>Sirius. </em>How could Dumbledore have thought Harry could do it, when it would defeat Aurors more accomplished?</p>\n<p>Harry put on his glasses, drew back the curtains quickly and saw the familiar image of Malfoy doing his work. Malfoy tilted his head, which Harry returned with a smile.</p>\n<p>His anger at Dumbledore dissipated the moment Malfoy\u2019s lips curved up. Feeling much calmer, Harry prepared for breakfast with Malfoy.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Harry returned to the common room during his free period, Luna was at the largest window seat. It was still morning; the sun shone through, lightening her hair. It brought flashes of Harry\u2019s dreams to the surface, and Harry blinked. Had he been dreaming about Luna? The whimsicalness of the songs stuck in his head <em>felt</em> like it could be her.</p>\n<p>She raised her head as he approached and gave him a dreamy greeting. \u201cHarry, your wrackspurts are clearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, okay.\u201d Harry glanced at the sketchbook in her hands, filled with images and neat writing of creatures that looked familiar and of ones that didn\u2019t. \u201cI was just\u2014I think I\u2019ve been seeing you in my dreams,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Luna smiled serenely at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being there though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry took a moment to understand. \u201cUm, oh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they good dreams?\u201d Luna gazed at him with clear eyes. Her voice was light and did not match the timbre Harry remembered.</p>\n<p>Harry felt a smile rise unbidden to his face. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luna placed a hand on his arm. \u201cThen everything will be fine.\u201d She smiled, her eyes going dreamy again. \u201cYou\u2019ll find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave her an uncertain smile and looked through the window with her. The person in his dreams couldn\u2019t have been her\u2014whoever it was, they were flat chested, and Luna certainly wasn\u2019t. Harry flushed when he caught himself looking at Luna\u2019s chest and quickly turned away.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed. He was just walking to lunch, a little late due to a trip to the Library, when he heard shouting.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody Slytherins! How dare you return to Hogwarts!\u201d</p>\n<p>He drew his wand and began to slowly swirl it, pointing to the floor. Lines of magic coalesced around him as the pendant\u2019s magic stirred in response. He took a moment to compose his face and posture.</p>\n<p>Then, he walked forwards and rounded the corner.</p>\n<p>He looked leisurely. As expected, the corridor was empty besides two Slytherins\u2014first or second years, given their height\u2014and three Hufflepuffs. <em>And to think that Hufflepuffs were stereotypically nice and fluffy</em>.</p>\n<p>They saw him immediately, and their attention shifted, wands raised and pointed directly at Draco. Draco flicked his eyes nonchalantly to the Slytherins. The two girls met his gaze with determination, but both were intelligent enough to quickly slip away from the Hufflepuff boys and past Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s <em>Draco Malfoy, </em>the <em>baby Death Eater</em>,\u201d the brawniest boy said. He flicked back dark brown hair as he advanced. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen you chumming up with Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco kept a blank face as he took a step forward. In his mind, he was chanting shields in preparation to counter almost anything they could throw at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, stop it,\u201d the boy snarled. \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t like you. He\u2019s just really noble sometimes. Don\u2019t mistake it for real friendship!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stiffened. He knew that, he <em>knew that already</em>. Potter was the <em>Golden Boy</em>, idiotically noble, forgiving, and <em>good</em>. Draco\u2014he couldn\u2019t even be just Draco, he was Draco <em>Malfoy</em>. The image of Potter smiling suddenly flashed in his mind. How much of that was fake?</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stupefy!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco twisted and the spell sliced the bottom edge of his robes. The other boys immediately cast again, faces twisted in anger. Draco advanced, mind focused. <em>Protego! Protego!</em> Sparks flew as hex and shield met, and the sharp sound of impact echoed through the corridors.</p>\n<p>Draco took a solid step forwards. The Hufflepuffs took a wary step backwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay away from us, Death Eater! We\u2019ll tell Professor Sprout!\u201d one yelled. Another threw a curse, but Draco was not distracted by their oft-repeated words.</p>\n<p>After all, he had thought that about himself. They could not hurt him more than he had already been hurt, by his own stupidity.</p>\n<p>The curse skidded around the pendant\u2019s shields in a full circle and shot straight back at the caster. With a yelp, the boy ducked and knocked into the other two with a grunt of pain. Draco continued forward mercilessly.</p>\n<p>The Hufflepuffs were finally catching on and they shuffled backward, wands trained warily at Draco\u2019s face. After all, <em>they</em> were the ones who said Draco was a Death Eater. And one couldn\u2019t be Death Eater without knowing something <em>Dark</em>.</p>\n<p>The self-imposed leader of the three cracked first. \u201cYou\u2014Malfoy...you stay away from us! Don\u2019t even think of attacking us!\u201d They stepped back until they pressed up against the wall, leaving Draco a clear path down the corridor.</p>\n<p>Draco took the path given to him, and he wasn\u2019t surprised when they cast at his back. The pendant\u2019s magic coalesced and most of the curses dissipated with a flash of light that made Draco\u2019s shadow stretch dark across the floor. He forced himself not to flinch when a sharp pain trickled across his back and instead thought of the possible counter-curse candidates and healing spells he required.</p>\n<p>The post-war world seemed to be one where Slytherins had more honour than Hufflepuffs.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry stretched back on the sofa, idling away in the Eighth Year common room. The room was pleasantly quiet, with any chatter in hushed tones and away from Harry.</p>\n<p>The person in Harry\u2019s dreams was Malfoy; he was sure of it. Harry had spent lunches and dinners observing all the students\u2014no one had blond hair quite as light as Malfoy, solid chest, firm muscle and <em>male</em>.</p>\n<p>The Malfoy that Harry saw in his dreams was warm, comforting, gentle and open. It made Harry obsess, just a bit, about whether the real Malfoy could be like that. And Harry had the feeling that he could be. The little smirks and smiles that appeared suddenly, though Harry hadn\u2019t figured out the pattern yet; the exasperated huff and rolled eyes when Harry was stuck in his homework that preceded Malfoy helping him. They all hinted things about Malfoy (<em>Draco)</em> that, at the moment, was just beyond Harry\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p>Draco was never in the common room, and Harry wondered if that should be on his list of things to make Draco do, right after making him talk. Harry felt a little disappointed at that; he thought that if he started talking \u2018for\u2019 Draco, Draco would eventually give in and start talking to him. Even if only because Harry\u2019s responses were shite.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe never see you at breakfast anymore,\u201d Ron said morosely, flopping down on the sofa next to Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned and shrugged. \u201cI like eating in the kitchens. It\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looked at him pointedly. \u201cAnd not due to a certain Slytherin you were obsessed with during sixth year?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was right, then,\u201d Harry grumbled, avoiding the question. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me from going to the kitchens,\u201d he said mock-petulantly.</p>\n<p>Hermione laughed. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t. Do your little thing with Malfoy, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron spluttered. \u201cHarry\u2019s not doing <em>anything</em> with Malfoy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushed. \u201cErr, we both eat breakfast in the kitchens. You can come if you want...\u201d Harry added, whilst thinking <em>please don\u2019t come.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo bloody way,\u201d Ron shook his head vehemently. \u201c<em>I</em> have the strength to go the Great Hall for <em>my</em> breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned and laughed at Ron's so serious expression.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Every morning since the chocolates arrived, Draco had taken one chocolate and let Harry pick one chocolate for himself. There were all sorts of dragons, lions, peacocks and flowers, all delicately and deliciously rendered in a range of chocolates: milk, white, dark, mint...more than Harry could name.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the world coming to\u2014a Malfoy picking a lion?\u201d Harry said, pointing in mock horror at the piece of chocolate Draco had just taken from the box.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a wicked grin and bit off the head. He pushed the box closer to Harry, and Harry peered inside.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cThere are only dragons and peacocks left!\u201d Gingerly, he picked up a Chinese Horntail dragon. He caught Draco\u2019s eyes, which sparkled with mirth. He straightened his back and put on a posh accent. \u201c<em>Why Potter, it was my dastardly plan all along</em>.\u201d Harry put on a pout. \u201cWell, I suppose dragons are cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked away as he closed the box, but Harry could make out the smile on his lips.</p>\n<p>It filled Harry with warmth as they settled back to their work without a word. He still hadn\u2019t made Draco talk; the singing in his dreams didn\u2019t count. He guessed that if Draco did talk, they\u2019d be trading a lot more insults. But since Harry was insulting himself, he couldn\u2019t be much hurt about it, not when Draco\u2019s eyes glinted his agreement.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Maybe Harry was getting a <em>teensy</em> bit more than a little obsessed with Draco, though he could proudly say he wasn\u2019t <em>as</em> obsessed as he was in sixth year.</p>\n<p>In his double free, he studied his Map, searching for the familiar name. He might followed Draco from his Transfigurations class to Arithmancy. He might have sat at the back of the class in his invisibility cloak watching Draco write out long elegant equations he couldn\u2019t make sense of. He might have trailed behind Draco as he left, last out of the class, on the way to the Library. He might have admired Draco\u2019s almost gliding walk, which reminded him a lot of Narcissa Malfoy\u2019s.</p>\n<p>But he definitely saw a group of four Hufflepuffs, two Ravenclaws and one Gryffindor facing off with a pair of Slytherins. Draco\u2019s back straightened and he continued forward, much to Harry\u2019s internal panic.</p>\n<p>The group attempted to surround Draco, the two Slytherins forgotten. Harry stuffed his Invisibility cloak in his pocket, drew his wand and ran forward. He had to dodge hexes and curses that came whistling back\u2014to his satisfaction, some of the group got hit by their own spells, falling over, legs tangled, or babbling in pain.</p>\n<p>By the time Harry was <em>there</em>, Draco had already turned the corner.</p>\n<p><em>No matter</em>.</p>\n<p>One of them\u2014a small, blond haired girl\u2014had spotted him and was frantically alerting the rest of her mates. Harry was then able to see all the faces of the attackers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d one of them said. They tried to smile at him.</p>\n<p>He glared back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he grounded out. \u201cSeven on one? That\u2019s hardly fair.\u201d He glanced at the Gryffindor, making the boy flinch. It was disappointing that all seven of them attended the Duelling Club. Harry hoped it wasn\u2019t because they wanted to learn how to attack people they didn\u2019t like.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy is perfectly in his right to challenge any of you to duel, do you <em>realise</em>? And if I see <em>any</em> of you indulging in this behaviour, I <em>will</em> report you, and I <em>will</em> kick you out of the duelling club.\u201d Harry narrowed his eyes when they just looked at him with gaping mouths. \u201c<em>Understand?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Their mouths snapped shut, heads nodding frantically. A few mumbled, \u201cYes, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The students acted immediately, streaming past Harry, in the opposite direction from which Draco went. Once the last of them disappeared from Harry\u2019s sight, he tucked away his wand.</p>\n<p>The distance that Draco had in dealing with them matched perfectly with the blank fa\u00e7ade Harry had seen of Draco. But it jarred with the softness Harry saw in the mornings and clashed with the Draco in his dreams. What Draco did was positively Gryffindor...maybe Draco could care as much as Harry suspected.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry watched Draco discretely the next morning, but he wasn\u2019t acting any different. The bare skin Harry could see\u2014hands, neck, face\u2014were unmarked, and there wasn\u2019t any unusual stiffness in Draco\u2019s posture that could suggest injury. Draco ate in his usual neat manner, and he wrote straight lines of readable words across his parchment.</p>\n<p>When Draco turned to him, eyebrow arched, Harry quickly leant over and squinted at Draco\u2019s work. \u201cAre you <em>sure</em> that\u2019s the answer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco swatted Harry\u2019s hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Of course, Scarhead</em>.\u201d Harry pouted. \u201cIf you say so. <em>My, you\u2019re very intelligent, Potter</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted and punched him in the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Harry rubbed his arm gingerly. \u201cFine, fine. Draco Malfoy is the most intelligent wizard ever,\u201d Harry intoned.</p>\n<p>Draco smirked, and Harry pretended to grouse some more, just to see Draco\u2019s eyes dance with humour.</p>\n<p>The noise of the kitchens was muted as it filtered through the muffling ward around them. Draco tilted his head slightly and examined Potter through his hair. Potter was engrossed in his work, plate of pancakes forgotten on the table.</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s dreams were horrible; Draco, at least, had been able to experience them lucid. He knew very well what dreaming a dream felt like: no control, and where all actions were ultimately futile. He saw it in every tense line of Potter\u2019s body in the dreams\u2014and worse, Potter had <em>lived</em> through those events. It was a wonder how Potter\u2014awake Potter\u2014had not turned bitter, snide, and sarcastic.</p>\n<p>Potter had almost stopped his midnight wanderings. He was resigned to Potter sleeping in his bed, but that meant he had reason to be a tiny bit proud about seeing Potter alert and refreshed.</p>\n<p>Draco was still uncertain about Potter being his <em>friend</em> though. He had accepted Potter\u2019s company in the early mornings, but...what would Mother do next? Draco already knew what Father would want him to do, in the post-war world. He would immediately accept Harry Potter\u2019s overtures of friendship and then use that friendship to boost the Malfoy reputation.</p>\n<p>Draco supposed Mother would accept that friendship too. Draco smiled inwardly. Mother would never do something so overt as using a friendship to boost reputation. She would make Potter a close friend, such that a boost in reputation looked like some side effect.</p>\n<p>But maybe, Draco should be friends with Harry Potter merely because Draco enjoyed his company, no matter how stupid that might be.</p>\n<p>He watched Potter fumble through the textbooks, writing in his chicken scratch across the parchment. After enduring a minute of Potter\u2019s frustrated sighs, Draco took pity and turned to help.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t think <em>Slytherins</em> would ambush him, but they did, early Thursday morning when Draco was making his way from the kitchens to the library. They rounded on him in one of the dusty, normally empty corridors he frequented\u2014which meant they\u2019d been watching, and Draco <em>had</em> to extend the range of his detection spells. Or maybe he had become complacent with Potter\u2019s company.</p>\n<p>It was a group of mainly middle-years\u2014third, fourth, and fifth. Their spokesperson was a seventh year, though. She was as tall as Draco, skin just as pale but hair dark as night.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco Malfoy.\u201d The way she curled her lip at his name amused him. It was something he'd used to do. \u201cIs there something you wish of us? Is your aid to gain our favour?\"</p>\n<p>Draco met her gaze blankly.</p>\n<p>A few seconds stretched to a minute. When Draco blinked, the seventh year tilted her eyes up and away.</p>\n<p>\u201cL-look.\u201d She stopped, probably mortified that she had stammered. She took just a second to compose herself, but her eyes fixed on a space just above Draco\u2019s eyes. \u201cUnderstand this, Draco Malfoy, that we do not require your assistance. Any rendered to us will be considered without tie or bind of debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned his gaze to the Slytherins behind her. They stood almost like Gryffindors and met his gaze, if only briefly. Draco entertained the notion of speaking to them, or using a group-Legilimency. Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. The curse still buzzed just slightly under his throat, courtesy of a wizard from the \u2018Light\u2019 side. The comforting press of the pendant\u2019s magic, of generations of Malfoys and of Father\u2019s magic, gave him courage. He settled on Legilimency.</p>\n<p>At that, Draco took a step back, so that he could capture all their gazes. He cleared his thoughts for a moment and curled his fingers about his wand. As he raised his wand and formed a slow swirl in the air, all eyes were drawn to his wand, even as they fumbled for their own wands.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legilimens inverto.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The buzz of the Slytherins\u2019 thoughts appeared like lines of fuzzy dots against a dark backdrop. Draco ignored them\u2014he had no interest in knowing what they were thinking. Not that he could know, given the nature of the modified spell.</p>\n<p><em>I have not and will not help you, </em>Draco projected.</p>\n<p>Their eyes widened. The smartest of them flinched away, breaking eye contact. But Draco had refined this spell over the summer, and <em>this</em> form of thought sending did not need eye contact once the spell was established. He stepped forwards slightly. Their leader stepped back. <em>She</em> hadn\u2019t broken eye contact, and Draco felt her suddenly throw up Occlumency shields.</p>\n<p>Draco gripped the links in his mind.<em> Why would I help those who will not think for themselves? Slytherins who do not act like Slytherins?</em></p>\n<p>Surprise and anger coloured their faces. Maybe now they\u2019d be smart and learn not to roam around alone or only in pairs. Or realised that they, at least, had the option to speak to McGonagall and try to make her believe them.</p>\n<p><em>It is not my fault they appear on my path. I merely walk through</em>, Draco ended, with a feeling of nonchalance. He cut the connection, no longer feeling like talking.</p>\n<p>When he stepped forwards, the Slytherins parted like water, giving him way.</p>\n<p>It made Draco realise that he did not include himself in \u2018Slytherin\u2019 any longer.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry checked the Map as often as he could, but he never saw any large group approach the lone <em>Draco Malfoy.</em></p>\n<p>Regardless, when Friday night Duelling Club came round, Harry made them all wait while he got onto the stage. He was easily able to pick out <em>those</em> students from the audience\u2014the ones that were looking away from him, instead of looking at him with curiosity. He'd already told Professor Flitwick and Neville that he wanted to talk to the students, though not what of, so they were looking at him curiously as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everyone here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The students glanced at each other, and a few nodded back at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded slowly. \u201cIt has come to my attention that some of you have not listened to Headmistress McGonagall's words at the Welcome Feast. <em>Remember</em>? Inter-house unity? Reconciliation?\u201d</p>\n<p>The students shuffled. Some of them looked away guiltily. A few made aborted attempts to cross their arms. Harry wondered if they had gone around hexing Slytherins as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear enough, that means <em>no attacking other students</em>. Just because someone is Slytherin doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad! Hell, Peter Pettigrew was a <em>Gryffindor</em>, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the stories about <em>him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, trying to get rid of his anger, but it built up instead. He paced about the stage, before going to the edge, glaring down at some particular students.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe War is over. Leave people alone. I don't <em>care</em> how cliche this sounds\u2014befriend people from other houses. And Draco Malfoy\u201d\u2014some of the students perked up\u2014\u201cwas a Death Eater. I <em>know</em>. He <em>was</em> a Death Eater. He\u2019s not any more. <em>I</em> testified for him at his trial. He has every right to be here. So if you think otherwise, you'd better come talk to me about it.\u201d Harry breathed deeply, but it had never calmed him before, and it didn\u2019t calm him now. \u201c<em>Understand</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we trust Slytherins at all? Can you name one <em>good</em> Slytherin?\u201d Zacharias Smith called out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMany Slytherins fought for <em>us</em> in the Battle of Hogwarts. I can\u2019t say the same for <em>you</em>!\u201d Harry said harshly.</p>\n<p>Smith sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re avoiding my question, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus Snape risked his life to spy for our side. Narcissa Malfoy <em>lied to Voldemort</em> and saved my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft.\u201d Smith rolled his eyes. \u201cA tiny act doesn\u2019t make them <em>good</em>. They were clearly trying to save themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Merlin!</em>\u201d Harry spat out. \u201cBloody Merlin was a Slytherin. Is that good enough for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zacharias fucking Smith shrugged. \u201cNo need to get so angry. I\u2019m just <em>saying</em> what everybody else is thinking.\u201d Geoffrey Hooper beside him made a noise of agreement.</p>\n<p>Harry glared. \u201cFine. Whatever. If you have a problem with Slytherins, talk to your head of House, talk to <em>me</em>. I will <em>not</em> tolerate attacks on them, in any circumstance. <em>Got it</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>The students he glared at quickly nodded, and the head-bobbing spread like a wave.</p>\n<p>Harry ran a frustrated hand through his hair. \u201cGood. Let\u2019s start,\u201d he said abruptly. He jumped down from the stage. His heart was thumping, and he felt like punching someone. Probably Smith.</p>\n<p>Neville touched his shoulder briefly. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head sharply. \u201cKinda caught it happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville looked concerned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you tell McGonagall then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, deflating. \u201cI know\u2014I just don\u2019t think the Slytherins would appreciate it, you know?\u201d <em>And neither would Draco</em>. \u201cLook, the next time I see it happening, I\u2019ll do the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville nodded, jaw set determinedly. \u201cI\u2019ll keep a look out too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry watched the other students closely. The Duelling Club was remarkably well behaved and muted, and the students looked sufficiently contrite. He noticed that they preferred to ask Neville or Flitwick for help. <em>Have they all done something?</em> Harry immediately kicked himself mentally. He had ignored the Slytherins, never noticing what was happening, and for some of the students, that may have looked as good as his consent.</p>\n<p>Harry rubbed his face. <em>Why can\u2019t people just get along?</em> That the statement could be turned on him was not lost on him. It reminded him of wanting Draco in the Duelling Club. <em>That\u2019ll never happen</em>, Harry thought tiredly.</p>\n<p>At the end of the club meeting, Professor Flitwick approached him. \u201cHas there been an incident, Mr. Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour speech. If you saw anything, you must report it,\u201d Flitwick insisted. \u201cI will be speaking to my House about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cNo one got hurt, aside from the attackers who hurt themselves. I\u2019m not going to say who were involved\u2014if they hadn\u2019t come forward, there must be a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flitwick frowned. \u201cMr. Potter, I understand students\u2019 dislike of so-called \u2018dobbing in\u2019, but attacking other students is unacceptable behaviour!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and Malfoy for six years?\u201d Harry queried.</p>\n<p>Flitwick folded his arms. \u201cI believe you have misplaced your sense of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Headmistress McGonagall\u2019s speech didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201d Harry said dejectedly. \u201cCan I return to the dorms now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis issue is not resolved,\u201d Flitwick warned, \u201cbut you may return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Professor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>On Friday night, Draco learnt that Padfoot was Sirius Black. His cousin, someone he never knew. He watched, feeling like an intruder, as dream-Harry laughed with Black. He shuddered as the dream darkened.</p>\n<p>He never wanted to see Bellatrix ever again, but he saw her often in Harry\u2019s dreams. Her face, twisted in dark glee, always managed to stir a deep fear in Draco, and when Black fell into the veil, a cry sundered the dream space.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! <em>No! Sirius!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry dropped to his knees with a great heaving sob and everything melted and disappeared until there was only Harry alone in the darkness, facing a deceptively beautiful Veil.</p>\n<p>Tears ran down Harry\u2019s face, unchecked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, it was all my fault, my fault. If it wasn\u2019t for me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made to approach Harry, but everything tilted, and Draco barely maintained his balance. They were suddenly at the astronomy tower. Draco sickened, looking down on his own face. He watched Dumbledore fall, a drop that seemed forever and an impact that shook the ground. It did not stop. And every time Draco tried to approach Harry, he was pushed back by the dream itself. Harry remained beyond his reach, and a low chant permeated the dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was my fault, I\u2019m sorry, it was my fault, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>It hurt Draco, because he knew it wasn\u2019t Harry\u2019s fault. It was Draco\u2019s. Snape and Dumbledore\u2014that was Draco\u2019s fault. Death Eaters at Hogwarts\u2014that was Draco\u2019s fault. The people locked in the Manor\u2019s dungeons, the Golden Trio before his eyes\u2014and he could do nothing but watch those trapped get tortured. And torture them himself.</p>\n<p>And...Draco had taken a long time to fully understand this, but it was the Dark Lord\u2019s fault.</p>\n<p>Draco wanted to embrace dream-Harry. He wanted to say\u2014<em>it\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s mine. I\u2019m sorry</em>\u2014but he couldn\u2019t. Or at least to say\u2014<em>it\u2019s not your fault, the fault lies solely on the Dark Lord</em>\u2014but the words stuck in his throat. Draco could only sing, and this time he sung of night and darkness, an angry song because Draco was too weak to stand the fear.</p>\n<p>He wanted Harry (<em>when did he start calling him Harry?</em>) to stop feeling guilty. He wanted him to be angry. Angry at the Dark Lord, angry at <em>Draco</em>, but not guilt, not guilt that was never supposed to his. Draco wanted to take it, that guilt. <em>Draco</em> deserved the shame. The hate.</p>\n<p>Not Harry.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry was still asleep Saturday morning when Draco started for the kitchens, so Draco went alone. After last night, Draco did not begrudge him. But he could not stop the smile when Harry arrived an hour later.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Harry said, as he dropped heavily onto his seat next to Draco. \u201c<em>Morning? You\u2019ve already wasted half of it</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. He found Harry trying to speak for him amusing. It had shocked him, at first. Harry didn\u2019t speak what Draco was thinking, but the times it came close was...comforting, in a way. To know Harry knew him well enough. Draco swallowed. After the incident with the other Slytherins, Draco had tried to talk again in vague hope that the curse had faded, but as he expected, it had not. There was nothing he could do, though, until the visit to the Manor during Hallowe\u2019en.</p>\n<p>House elves came to set Harry\u2019s breakfast and things settled down into their comfortable routine.</p>\n<p>After an hour of work, Draco leaned back, stretching. His fingers were stained with ink where they brushed against the parchment. Annoyed, he drew his wand and cast a cleaning spell. Sometimes the ink just simply didn\u2019t dry fast enough.</p>\n<p>Harry lifted his head, meeting Draco\u2019s eyes with a smile. \u201cMalfoy. Fancy a leisurely fly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stilled. He hadn\u2019t flown with other people since the Fiendfyre. Harry kept his smile, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfraid I\u2019ll beat you? <em>You can\u2019t </em>beat<em> someone at flying leisurely, Scarhead.</em> Aha\u2014so you\u2019re scared.\u201d Harry tried to curl his lip into a sneer, but it failed, looking like a grin instead. \u201c<em>In your dreams, Potter. I\u2019ll beat you at leisurely flying!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn\u2019t daft enough to say something like that. Harry\u2019s smile, uncertain around the edges, did it for him, though. Draco stood up in a huff. Harry leapt out of his seat, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Harry continued when Draco glared, \u201c<em>You won\u2019t be smug when I beat you!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>They cleaned up their things and headed quickly back to their dorm room. It was still pre-breakfast and they saw no one on their way to the dorms, nor out to the Quidditch pitch. Draco was just relieved that he had his broom and flying gear with him. The idea of an early morning fly was <em>good</em>\u2014without the stress of trying to catch a snitch.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry was surprised at his own words when he asked Draco out for a fly. He was even more surprised when Draco accepted. Regardless, Harry didn\u2019t regret it.</p>\n<p>Draco looked good in his flying gear\u2014lighter and more form-fitting than standard Quidditch gear. Harry ripped his eyes away, trying to ignore that prickling of unease of <em>staring at a boy</em>. Another part of his mind pointed out unhelpfully, <em>Draco\u2019s more a man than a boy</em>. Harry shook his head, which just made Draco look at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust thinking. <em>I never would have thought,</em>\u201d Harry quipped back.</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>The Quidditch pitch was just ahead. Harry put in a sprint to get there first. Throwing a challenging look back, Harry mounted and kicked off. Even though he expected it, he startled at the sudden rush of wind as Draco shot past him. Harry really <em>did</em> mean a leisurely fly, but Draco raced, body streamlined, around the pitch.</p>\n<p>But most of all, Draco was <em>fast, </em>and it showed best when Draco skimmed just over the stands. The quick-blur of Draco as he <em>flew</em> made Harry dizzy. Draco pulled ahead of him, circled, and came back behind him. Harry half twisted to see, but Draco whizzed past, and the tornado that seemed to follow him buffeted Harry away from the perfect circle he had been making around the pitch.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you call that leisurely, then I\u2019ve won!\u201d Harry shouted sullenly as he righted himself. Draco tilted his head back, and Harry\u2019s heart was already lifting when Draco\u2019s lips quirked into a smile.</p>\n<p>And then Draco <em>laughed</em>, and Merlin, Harry\u2019s breath caught in his throat. It was entirely unexpected and unfamiliar. The morning light lit Draco\u2019s hair like a golden halo around his head, and the uncharacteristicly open expression\u2014one Harry would have vehemently denied possible on <em>Malfoy\u2019s </em>face\u2014made Draco look beautiful, almost Veela in flight.</p>\n<p>And Merlin <em>and</em> Godric, Harry knew what a catch in his breath and a skip in his heart meant. It meant that he\u2014that Harry was\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry forcefully looked away from Draco. He couldn\u2019t even <em>think</em> it, only feel it, know it, and dread it. <em>It\u2019s fine, Harry, just...ignore it. Draco\u2019s a friend. Your crush will go away. The other crushes went away, didn\u2019t they? You...f-felt that about Cho, and about Ginny, but you don\u2019t anymore, do you? It\u2019ll go away. It </em>will.</p>\n<p>This \u2018crush\u2019 was just a product of being around Draco more frequently. The rush of making a new friend. That's <em>all</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco shot past him again, smirking.</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed, trying to recall their usual banter. \u201cI really just wanted a relaxing fly!\u201d Harry shouted after Draco. Draco just grinned back. And stuck his tongue out.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cOh, it\u2019s like that, is it?\u201d And he leaned over his broom and forced up his speed, chasing Draco\u2019s laughter around the pitch.</p>\n<p>With Hallowe\u2019en approaching at the end of the week, Hogwarts became lively, and the Great Hall was sickeningly decorated. Draco, however, only appreciated the pre-Hallowe\u2019en treats the house elves slipped him when he was in the kitchens alone.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Harry\u2019s dreams were worsening. Sometimes, all Draco could see was darkness, and the dreams\u2019 very emotions\u2014<em>guilt</em>, <em>hurt, despair</em>\u2014seeped into him. He knew Harry was there, somewhere, but Draco couldn\u2019t find him, and no song seemed to reach.</p>\n<p>And the times that Draco could reach out, could draw Harry into his embrace, Harry stopped crying, but he remained quiet, tense.</p>\n<p>Draco learnt that Prongs was James Potter, Moony was Professor Lupin; Draco learnt about Tonks\u2014yet another cousin he never knew\u2014and about the death of Fred Weasley.</p>\n<p>Draco saw himself, in those dreams. Watching torture. Torturing.</p>\n<p>He always woke up with Harry\u2019s head tucked under his chin and Harry\u2019s face streaked with tears. Sometimes, Harry was sleep-whispering, <em>I\u2019m sorry</em>.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s not your fault</em>, Draco thought fiercely. <em>It\u2019s not</em>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The moment the first decorations for Hallowe\u2019en came up, Harry\u2019s uncomfortable thoughts about Draco rapidly disappeared. He started wandering again and never woke up early enough to accompany Draco to the kitchens.</p>\n<p>The Hallowe\u2019en Feast gave Harry a headache. Everyone\u2019s smiling faces, cheerful chattering made Harry sullen and angry. He escaped, feeling Hermione\u2019s worried look against his back, but he <em>couldn\u2019t</em> stand all the fucking happiness\u2014didn\u2019t they know that his parents had <em>died</em> on this day, seventeen years ago?</p>\n<p>He growled, as he dodged yet another clump of students illegally drinking alcohol. The students and ghosts filled the corridors of Hogwarts with too much noise, leaving Harry no place to roam. He stomped through the eighth-year common room and up the stairs. Though, he quietened his footsteps as he entered the dorm room because Malfoy\u2019s curtains were drawn up. <em>Even on Hallowe\u2019en, Malfoy follows his schedule</em>. Harry slumped back on his bed.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t remember much of his mum\u2014he feared that he had false memories, conjured up from his dreams and the pictures of her he\u2019d seen. But he was certain that one memory was true. He was safe, warm in his mum\u2019s arms, her scent enfolding him. Her voice was a lullaby, and Harry felt himself sleep in a dream\u2014</p>\n<p>And then it was chaos. There was Voldemort, and he could hear Mum\u2019s scream, and he could see the Killing curse fly towards him, sickly green, and <em>\u201cNo-no-no!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>His eyes opened, he became aware of a warm embrace, and he thought maybe\u2014maybe it was his <em>mum</em> hugging him\u2014and the War and Voldemort was just a dream\u2014</p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t a dream. His mum had died.</p>\n<p>Wetness welled in his eyes. The arms around him tightened. Harry saw the brief flicker of white-blond hair, and he felt the hurt easing, burrowing his head into the hand that stroked him, his face into the chest curled next to him. The person smelt of tea and paper, and a kind of male muskiness. <em>It\u2019s Draco</em>, he began thinking, but the rest of the thoughts drifted away when he felt and heard the gentle hum of the song of the stars.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s dream chilled Draco. Harry remembered his mother dying. Harry remembered the strike of the killing curse.</p>\n<p>Draco loathed himself. He\u2019d let Harry sleep in bed, had hugged Harry in his sleep without consent. Draco was a <em>fucking Death Eater</em>, one of the followers of the very person that <em>killed</em> Harry\u2019s parents. The Dark Lord was the direct cause of the very deaths that tore Harry up inside, and Draco had followed that man; had bowed to that man, had his mark permanently burned into his arm.</p>\n<p>He turned the water in the shower as hot as he could, but no amount of scrubbing removed the disgust.</p>\n<p>Harry was sleeping fitfully when Draco left for the kitchens.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Harry woke up, stretching in his own bed, sunlight streaming in and rather late in the morning, waking up in Draco\u2019s arms felt like an oddly good dream. A flush of shame filled his stomach. He wasn\u2019t...<em>no</em>. He <em>couldn\u2019t</em> start dreaming about those kinds of things.</p>\n<p>The hurt in his chest felt physical, but it was alright; he was not supposed to be happy on the day he was going to visit his parents\u2019 graves.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>As soon as he could, Draco slipped out of Hogwarts. The moment he left the anti-Apparition wards, he apparated to the private receiving room of the Manor. Draco had barely started relaxing when he was quickly swamped by an enthusiastic Pansy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco! We\u2019ve missed you <em>so</em> much. Are you sure you won\u2019t transfer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy drew back enough so that Draco could see Blaise. Draco had missed them <em>so much,</em> but where was...</p>\n<p>Pansy followed his gaze. \u201cGreg\u2019s still at the reserve.\u201d She scowled at Blaise. \u201c<em>Blaise</em>, don\u2019t just stand there! Merlin, you should just see him at Beauxbaton\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise rolled his eyes, as Pansy dragged Draco over to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet the man breathe, Pans,\u201d Blaise drawled.</p>\n<p>Draco felt his tension draining away. He was safe here. Draco opened his mouth to speak, but his throat immediately constricted and he choked.</p>\n<p>Pansy was immediately concerned; even Blaise was frowning. \u201cDid the curse return?\u201d Pansy questioned. She made to examine his jaw, and Draco let her.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Pansy repeated.</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes and nodded.</p>\n<p>Pansy frowned and tucked a lock of Draco\u2019s hair behind his ear. \u201cWhen did it happen? Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>He raised his wand, and at their nods, cast a modified <em>Legilimens</em>.</p>\n<p><em>When I returned to Hogwarts. I did not want to worry you\u2014nothing could be done while I was at Hogwarts</em>.</p>\n<p>Pansy sighed. \u201cIf you say so. Aunt Cissa is waiting for us in the North Orangery for morning tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father\u2019s there too, Draco,\u201d Blaise warned.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ll be fine.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Pansy gave Draco a wane smile and hooked her arms around both Draco and Blaise.</p>\n<p>The North Orangery was beautifully sunlit, and gentle atmospheric charms kept the room from overheating. Draco could feel Mother\u2019s magic hum about them. Father and Mother both sat at the table. Draco nodded to both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d Mother said. She rose from her chair and embraced him. \u201cHow are you, darling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco breathed her scent in, and for a moment, the sharp contrast between <em>here</em> and <em>Hogwarts</em> made his eyes prickle. When he didn\u2019t reply, Mother placed a hand on his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d</p>\n<p>He glanced quickly to Pansy. \u201cThe curse,\u201d Pansy said bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco!\u201d Mother pressed her hands against Draco\u2019s cheeks, checking his mouth, and his throat. \u201cIs it the same?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Pansy replied for Draco. \u201cDo we still have all the\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother nodded, determined. \u201cYes.\u201d She guided Draco to a chair. \u201cSit, Draco. Have some tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco had barely nodded before Mother gave him an absent kiss and started walking swiftly away, commanding Pansy to follow. They swept out of the room, and he knew they would return soon, with books and potions. Even <em>Father</em> busied himself, calling house elves and flipping quickly through a heavy tome.</p>\n<p>Draco, once, tried to help, but Pansy very insistently pushed him down.</p>\n<p>\"Be patient, Draco,\" she chided teasingly.</p>\n<p>After that, Draco sat (im)patiently and drank his tea, and Blaise sat next to him, demolishing the pastries the house elves brought.</p>\n<p>Father made a triumphant sound and paced quickly over to Draco. He arched an eyebrow at Draco, in way of permission, before he cast a spell on Draco. The spell tingled, and Father nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the same curse,\u201d he called out.</p>\n<p>\"Understood,\" Mother said, across the room.</p>\n<p>Father nodded at Draco once again and closed his book. He placed a hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco did not know what to say\u2014neither did Father, it seemed. In the end, Mother called Father. Father squeezed, just slightly, and he turned and walked over to Mother.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed, and set down his tea cup, overwhelmed with feeling. After being surround by students but alone at Hogwarts, to finally be in the presence of people who did not ignore him, did not attack him\u2014<em>Father, Mother, Pansy, even Blaise. </em>Letters weren\u2019t enough to convince Draco that they still cared for him. But this did.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After breakfast, Hermione and Ron accompanied Harry to Godric\u2019s Hollow. Harry dearly wished for rain, but the sky remained patchy and the ground dry.</p>\n<p>They freshened the protective charms around the graves, and Harry laid down an array of white flowers\u2014roses, chrysanthemums and lilies. Silently, Hermione and Ron stepped away, giving Harry some privacy.</p>\n<p>The dream had repeated in Harry\u2019s mind since he woke up. His mother\u2019s warmth, her scent, her voice. The Killing Curse.</p>\n<p>Draco.</p>\n<p>It felt so <em>wrong</em> to dream of Draco. It felt like...desecrating the only memory he had of his mother, and he felt sick for enjoying the dream of Draco\u2019s embrace.</p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t the nightmares stop after the War ended? After all he had done, had sacrificed, couldn\u2019t he just be <em>normal?</em> Go to school, complain about classes, and worry about a girlfriend?</p>\n<p>Instead, he kept having nightmares, and Draco appeared in the nightmares, and he was becoming friends with Draco, but Draco never talked to him, and Slytherins were being attacked\u2014</p>\n<p>Eventually, Hermione placed a hand on his arm. \u201cYou said you were going to have lunch at Mrs. Tonk\u2019s place?\u201d she said quietly.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded shortly, not ready to trust his voice.</p>\n<p>Hermione patted his arm sympathetically. \u201cRon and I will head to the Burrow first. We\u2019ll meet back at Hogsmeade at four, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry forced his lips into a smile.</p>\n<p>Hermione looked unconvinced, but let go of his arm. \u201cAlright, Harry.\u201d She walked back to where Ron was, and after they both waved, the pair apparated from the graveyard.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It was after a long while before Harry felt ready to apparate to Andromeda\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>He landed just beyond the front door, and he was surprised to hear a number of voices from inside. When he knocked, the door immediately opened, revealing Andromeda.</p>\n<p>She smiled at him, stepping aside to let him in. \u201cHello, Harry. Just in time for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Andromeda.\u201d Harry cautiously stepped in. \u201cWho are...?\u201d</p>\n<p>Andromeda smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re all in the dining room. You can hang your coat here\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry followed her directions distractedly. The voices sounded vaguely familiar.</p>\n<p>\u201cNarcissa is here with her son, Draco, and some of his friends.\u201d Andromeda looked at Harry. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind. I read in the papers that you and Draco have put behind your rivalries.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Draco?! </em>Draco was here?</p>\n<p>Andromeda seemed oblivious to Harry\u2019s mental crisis as she led Harry to the dining room.</p>\n<p>Teddy, Mrs. Malfoy, Parkinson, Zabini.</p>\n<p>But the moment he saw Draco, it felt impossible to tear his gaze away. Unlike Harry, Draco did not look surprised to see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2019s here!\u201d Andromeda announced cheerfully. \u201cTake a seat, Harry, and I\u2019ll bring lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked and looked at her uncertainly. She gave him an encouraging look.</p>\n<p>Zabini rose. He looked at Harry only briefly before addressing Andromeda. \u201cAllow me to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Andromeda nodded, and the two headed to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Parkinson, whom had been cradling Teddy, approached Harry first. \u201cPotter. Long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded, not knowing what to say. He accepted Teddy, and he was relieved when Teddy babbled at him, grabbing his clothes eagerly. Harry let Teddy\u2019s tiny fist grab onto his finger. \u201cHullo, Teddy,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down, Mr. Potter?\u201d Mrs. Malfoy said, indicating the chair across from Draco\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, yeah, thanks.\u201d Harry felt himself flush under their gazes. He busied himself with occupying Teddy\u2019s attention, while trying desperately not to listen to Parkinson\u2019s conversation with the two Malfoys.</p>\n<p>\u201cHogwarts is <em>entirely</em> old-fashioned and completely behind the times,\u201d Parkinson was complaining. \u201cThey should let you off campus every week.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was an odd pause before Parkinson continued, sighing dramatically. \u201cHogsmeade isn\u2019t Paris, but it\u2019s better than seeing the same bloody walls all the time. I thought I\u2019d go mad!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage, Pansy,\u201d Mrs. Malfoy said, amusement colouring her tone. \u201cChildren pick up the oddest things, no matter how young they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was that odd silence again. Parkinson snorted. \u201cDraco, we are going spend the entire Christmas hols <em>out</em> and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer\u2014hey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked up in time to see Draco poke Parkinson on the shoulder. She rolled her eyes back at him. Her eyes immediately met to Harry.</p>\n<p>She narrowed her eyes, just slightly, at him. \u201cPotter. How is Hogwarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked, momentarily mind-blanked. \u201cFine, I guess. No one out to kill me this year, so yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Parkinson cast Draco a look. Draco must have sent Parkinson some kind of message, because she straightened, and faced Harry again. \u201cI\u2014just want to apologise for what I did during the war. For trying to offer you to the Dark Lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014that\u2019s fine. I understand,\u201d Harry said hastily. His gaze quickly drifted to Draco, who still hadn\u2019t said a word.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Malfoy raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you wish to speak to Draco privately, Mr. Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened, as Draco rolled his eyes at his mother.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no, that\u2019s fine. Call me Harry.\u201d Harry fiddled with the hem of his jumper. \u201cMr. Potter sounds a bit weird.\u201d He met Parkinson\u2019s eyes, then Draco. \u201cHarry,\u201d he repeated.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Malfoy nodded. \u201cHarry, then. Then please, call me Narcissa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Parkinson gave a huge sigh. \u201c<em>Fine</em>. Since you\u2019re Draco\u2019s friend. But if I\u2019m calling you Harry, you may as well call me Pansy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smiled, and patted Parkinson\u2014Pansy\u2014on the shoulder. Pansy frowned at Draco, and then leaned across the table to address Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, <em>Harry</em>, how <em>did</em> Draco convince you to cast on you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry looked wide-eyed at Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco gave Harry an apologetic look, and stiffly turned his head away from Pansy.</p>\n<p>Pansy poked Draco, looking annoyed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cD-Draco didn\u2019t cast anything on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy looked back and forth between Harry and Draco suspiciously. \u201cThen how did you talk? He didn\u2019t write everything down, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p>A choked sound came from Draco. Muffled laughter, Harry realised.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d Pansy poked Draco some more, but Draco shook his head at the table. Suddenly, Pansy huffed. \u201cFine, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco touched Pansy\u2019s arm. With a sigh, she turned to Harry again. \u201cDraco wants to cast a Legilimency spell.\u201d Her eyes flickered to Draco then back to Harry. \u201cNot that you have to. Seriously, though, it\u2019s weird being your mouth, Draco,\u201d Pansy added with a whine. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t talk <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014that\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry cut in. \u201cYou can cast it,\u201d he quickly added, before realising that he didn't want Draco to read his thoughts. His head was whirring, though. Did he hear Pansy correctly? Was Draco <em>unable</em> to talk before?</p>\n<p>Draco raised his wand with a small smile that stopped Harry\u2019s thoughts. Harry\u2019s eyes and forehead tingled for a moment, but dimly, Harry realised that it was nothing like Snape\u2019s Legilimency.</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t worry, I can\u2019t read your thoughts</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry startled. \u201cWow, that was.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWeird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy waved her hand dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. Now here comes the food!\u201d</p>\n<p>Teddy twisted in Harry\u2019s arms at the exclamation so Harry shifted him almost upright to watch Andromeda and Zabini\u2014Blaise, Harry supposed\u2014enter the room with plates and bowls of food.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Andromeda said warmly. \u201cI just need to pop back and get Teddy\u2019s lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Blaise said, as he put down the salad near Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all given names now,\u201d Pansy drawled. \u201cSo he\u2019s Harry and you\u2019re Blaise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise raised his eyebrows in mock surprise. \u201cBlaise, hm? I was wondering what my name was.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was the oddest thing to feel Draco\u2019s amusement-laughter in his mind. <em>Blaise, cut the pie.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Blaise. I want some salad too,\u201d Pansy added, smirking.</p>\n<p>Blaise rolled his eyes, but good naturedly did as they asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been demoted to waitstaff,\u201d he said woefully. \u201cAunt Cissa?\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa nodded. \u201cThank you, Blaise,\u201d she said, accepting the laden plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you, Harry?\u201d Blaise asked.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded meekly.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Once Andromeda returned though, the bulk of the conversation centred on her and Narcissa. Harry made himself busy by eating and fussing over Teddy. He couldn\u2019t help darting looks at Draco though, who seemed to be returning slightly guilty looks back.</p>\n<p>When lunch concluded, Andromeda lifted Teddy out of Harry\u2019s arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Teddy\u2019s nap now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go speak privately with Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-why?\u201d Harry took a defensive step back.</p>\n<p>Andromeda and Narcissa shared looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco, take Harry to the study, will you, darling?\u201d Narcissa said, placing a hand on Draco\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p><em>Yes, Mother,</em> was Draco\u2019s voice in Harry\u2019s head. <em>Come on Harry, we better do as they say.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the lounge, Draco,\u201d Pansy said. She and Blaise were already up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so...\u201d Harry said. Draco nodded.</p>\n<p>In the study, Draco leaned against the table, and Harry against the closed door.</p>\n<p><em>Mother and Aunt Andromeda want us to talk, so I suppose you should talk</em>, Draco said, breaking the silence.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned though. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing\u2014why don\u2019t you talk? What was Parkin\u2014Pansy talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco visibly swallowed. \u201cSore throat.\u201d He winced, and so did Harry. His voice was dry and raspy.</p>\n<p>Harry stepped away from the door, moving towards Draco. \u201cBut it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve been sick for the last month, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No. I\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry prompted.</p>\n<p>Draco grimaced. <em>It was a curse. Every time I tried to speak, my throat would close up</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry had crossed the room now, standing just a few steps from Draco. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014terrible. Who would do that? And how could you spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. <em>Nonverbals.</em> <em>It\u2019s fine, the curse is broken now. My throat is just a bit rough.</em></p>\n<p>Harry though was <em>not</em> done with it. \u201cI feel like a fucking idiot. I should have known you wouldn\u2019t not talk if you could\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck off!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014yeah, yeah\u2014and all those times I pretended to be you\u2014\u201d Harry flushed. \u201cI must have sounded really stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Loath as I am to say this, you are </em>not<em> an idiot. There was no reason you should have known, and I never told you</em>. There was an odd light in Draco\u2019s eyes as he crossed the last distance between them. He reached out, touching Harry lightly. <em>And I\u2014I greatly appreciate what you did. Thank you.</em></p>\n<p>Harry stared into Draco\u2019s eyes, closer than they\u2019d ever been, grey and silver glints. He was aware, suddenly, of Draco\u2019s height\u2014just taller than him, making Harry tilt his head back to meet Draco\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry finally whispered.</p>\n<p>Draco stepped away, and Harry tried not to follow his warmth. Harry scrambled for something to say. \u201cAbout the curse...\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Do you really want to know about the curse?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Harry said strongly.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a suspicious look. <em>Do I have your silence? To not run off and do something ridiculously </em><em>heroic</em><em> afterwards?</em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco could see Harry struggle to say yes. There were reasons why Draco hadn\u2019t told Harry about it, and one of them was to avoid being Harry Potter\u2019s pity project.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Harry said. He tugged at the bird nest on his head. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone. And I won\u2019t run off. Unless you let me,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Draco scowled. <em>I mean it</em>. <em>I\u2019ll bloody book you a personal dinner with the Giant Squid if I have to.</em></p>\n<p>Harry looked back at him defiantly. \u201cI mean it too.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Of course you do</em>. Draco turned and sat down on the sofa. It was too squishy for Draco\u2019s liking, and he struggled to relax. After a moment, Harry joined him.</p>\n<p><em>It was after the trials. Within the hour you returned my wand</em>. Draco kept his gaze fixed at the far wall. <em>Not everyone wanted me freed</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry shifted beside him. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. <em>You, Potter, don\u2019t count. Most people do not have a hero-complex</em>. Draco could remember it clearly. He was still dazed from being told that he wasn\u2019t headed for Azkaban and from the familiar warmth of his wand\u2014a wand that still recognised him despite its brief stint in Potter\u2019s hand. Potter had left quickly, just after Draco had forced out a thanks at his mother\u2019s request.</p>\n<p>There had been a lot of shouting, and a lot of screaming. Guards had surrounded him and his parents, to accompany them out of the courtroom and to the nearest Floo. But the guards weren\u2019t vigilant enough. Or perhaps it was one of <em>them</em> whom cast it.</p>\n<p><em>After you left, someone cast a spell. It hit me. They might having been aiming for my father, but\u2014it hit me on the arm. It was only a brief sting, and in the chaos, I did not notice anything more. </em>Draco breathed. <em>The guards pushed us through the Floo, and Mother called out the destination. And then, when I tried to speak...I just started to choke.</em></p>\n<p>Draco turned to Harry and was surprised that Harry\u2019s gaze was fixed so firmly on him. Draco tried to relax, to break the tension. <em>It was all quite shocking and scary, I assure you. I had to write things down, or have Legilimency cast on me whenever I wanted to say something. I, of course, eventually found this modified-reverse-legilimency, and became </em>stunningly<em> fantastic at non-verbal magic.</em> Draco looked at Harry pointedly. <em>You may clap, minion.</em></p>\n<p>Harry cracked a grin and clapping obligingly. \u201cAmazing,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Draco nodded imperiously, and continued when Harry stopped clapping. <em>Then we\u2014Father, Mother and I\u2014found the curse and determined the cure. So I could speak by the time I returned to Hogwarts, September.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou said \u2018Potter\u2019 to me at the Welcome Feast,\u201d Harry said slowly.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cThen someone cast the curse at you again. Maybe the same person\u2014or group of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco reluctantly nodded. It was on his way to the first breakfast at Hogwarts. A cluster of seventh years came up from behind and\u2014the rest was the past. Draco rolled his shoulders and stood up. <em>Now you know the story. I think that\u2019s enough talking.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014you can\u2019t just leave it\u2014\u201d Harry protested, quickly following Draco. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t so amazing at non-verbals, you\u2019d be almost be\u2014be without magic.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Undoubtedly their intentions.</em> Draco turned sharply. <em>Look, it\u2019s over. I can spell, I can talk and their plan failed miserably. There\u2019s nothing more I can ask for. And you gave your word, Harry</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry startled, green eyes widening. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>You gave your word.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry visibly deflated. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d His shoulders slouched, and his head bowed minutely enough that he peered at Draco through his lashes.</p>\n<p>Draco was struck with the image of Harry in his dreams. Defeated. Meek. It was a far cry from the person standing in front of him, but it was a reminder of Harry\u2019s horrid childhood and Draco lost the resolve to snap back.</p>\n<p><em>Look, Harry, I just want to get through the school year. </em>Draco huffed. <em>But if it makes you feel better, I am not adverse to having the Saviour-of-the-Wizarding-world as my personal guard. You\u2019ll have to follow me around, always half a step behind me to the left and watching out for miscreants. And at night, you\u2019ll have to stand outside the door and watch out for more miscreants, and at meal times, you\u2019ll have to taste my meals in case of poison and\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Harry laughed. \u201cOkay, got it, your Highness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. <em>I like that. You may continue calling me </em>your Highness<em>. Or perhaps </em>your Majesty<em>. Or Draco Malfoy, the greatest wizard on Earth.</em></p>\n<p>\"<em>May</em>be,\" Harry said dubiously, but he was grinning again.</p>\n<p>\n<em>*</em>\n</p>\n<p>After that, they returned to the lounge room, where Andromeda was already setting up some wizarding board game. Harry had a surprisingly good time, even if everyone was thoroughly thrashed by Andromeda. Once Teddy woke up, Andromeda and Narcissa retired whilst Harry and the Slytherins (or, ex-Slytherins) entertained Teddy. Winners were determined by what hair colour Teddy had, but it was hard to tell, since Harry, Blaise and Pansy all had black hair.</p>\n<p>Harry was reluctant to leave first. After all, who knew what <em>those three </em>would be plotting the moment Harry was gone? But eventually, time cut close and Harry had to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come over during Christmas won\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d Andromeda asked, leading Harry to the door.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Andromeda smiled back. \u201cIt was good seeing you today. Now, look after yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Harry promised, and turned on the spot, apparating to Hogsmeade.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re almost late!\u201d Hermione was the first person Harry saw.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he <em>isn\u2019t</em> late,\u201d Ron interjected, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>Hermione ignored Ron. \u201cDid you have fun at Mrs. Tonks\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d At Hermione\u2019s and Ron\u2019s expectant faces, Harry elaborated. \u201cNarcissa Malfoy was there too, along with Dra...\u201d Could he call them by their given names? <em>Yes</em>, he thought firmly. \u201cDraco, Pansy and Blaise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron reddened. \u201cReally? First name basis now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so bad when they\u2019re not out to hurt you. Or with a Teddy in their midst,\u201d Harry said defensively.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him an unreadable look, then smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had a good time. Everyone else is already at the Hogs Head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and was content to follow their lead.</p>\n<p>Harry hadn\u2019t forgotten Draco\u2019s words from Saturday afternoon. There were people in the school who had attacked Draco, and Harry had witnessed an attack himself. Granted, that group of students were poised to attack two younger Slytherins, but they had turned on Draco fast.</p>\n<p><em>I\u2014I caught it! I </em>won<em>, Potter! </em>Draco\u2019s gleeful thought filled Harry\u2019s mind, forcing him back into the present. Draco lifted the fluttering practice Snitch, and it glinted in the morning light, just like his hair.</p>\n<p>Harry flew over to Draco, grinning back. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to beat me for every time I beat you.\u201d He held up his hand and pretended to count earnestly. \u201cNow, there was that time during second year, and second year again, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes. <em>You did </em>not<em> let me win on purpose, did you?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, no!\u201d Harry retorted. He lunged, grabbing Draco\u2019s fist and prising the Snitch away. \u201cI'm going to win so often so that you\u2019ll never catch up with me in your entire lifetime!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh, you\u2019re on, Potter!</em> Draco bumped his broom against Harry's. <em>Release the Snitch</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry obliged, uncurling his fist. The Snitch immediately zoomed away from them. \u201cReady\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Go! </em>Draco cut him off. He shot past Harry, leaving Harry behind in his turbulent wake.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They played four games in total: two wins to Draco, two to Harry, and they collapsed on the pitch in utter exhaustion. Draco had the Snitch once again, smiling infectiously at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cNone of your losses have been made up. We better play again next week, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes, but he continued smiling nonetheless. He held his arm up, pointing the Snitch to the sky and looking at it contemplatively. Harry, however, was looking at Draco, flushed and dishevelled.</p>\n<p>A sudden clapping ruined the moment.</p>\n<p>Draco's eyes went wide and he sat up abruptly, hand already reaching for his wand. Harry scrambled up less gracefully. Surprise shot through him.</p>\n<p>Madam Hooch was approaching them, smiling. Behind her, on the stands, were a smattering of students. When had they come? What had they seen? Had any of them tried to hex Draco while they were still in the <em>air</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good games, boys!\u201d Hooch enthused. \u201cBeautiful flying, Mr. Malfoy, and top form as always, Mr. Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked back at her, taken aback by the compliments. At the corner of his eye, he could see that Draco was surprised and uncertain.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Madam Hooch,\u201d Harry said awkwardly. \u201cI hope we didn\u2019t go into some team\u2019s practice time, did we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Hooch smiled affably. \u201cNot at all. I\u2019m surprised that Mr. Malfoy is not coaching the Slytherin team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tell her I don\u2019t have time.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. \u201cErr, Draco doesn\u2019t have time. He...um, he wants to focus on his NEWTs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Hooch looked between Harry and Draco with surprise. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said sympathetically. She headed off the pitch and Harry and Draco followed her, brooms in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you do plan to have longer Seeker games though, you\u2019re welcome to book the pitch,\u201d Madam Hooch said, looking back at them.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you return to the castle? You boys must be hungry after all that\u2014and I believe breakfast is still running.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shot Draco a look. \u201cYep, thanks, Madam Hooch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Hooch smiled and waved them off.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Draco,\u201d Harry said quickly.</p>\n<p><em>You don\u2019t expect me to go the Great Hall like </em>this,<em> do you?</em> Draco grimaced, picking at his sweat soaked clothes.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, chuckling at Draco\u2019s disgusted expression. \u201cAlmost, but no. I\u2019ll let you have the bathroom first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sighed dramatically. <em>Oh, good</em>.</p>\n<p>As they returned to the castle, Harry glanced back at the Quidditch Pitch, where he could still see the vague forms of students on the stands.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco emerged from the bathroom feeling wonderfully clean. Harry, who had been lazing in his bed, sat up and gave Draco a strange look.</p>\n<p>Draco looked back at Harry pointedly. <em>What is it? Bathroom\u2019s yours</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry looked away momentarily. \u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d come to the Library with me.\u201d He suddenly flushed and quickly added, \u201cWith Hermione and Ron too. I mean...you\u2019re usually in the Library on Sundays, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco slowly nodded in answer to the last question, but he was fully ready to reject Harry\u2019s offer. <em>Harry</em> might not mind his presence, but it was highly likely Granger and Weasley would. And then there were Harry\u2019s fans. Given the faces Draco saw on the stands, he hadn\u2019t become more well-liked by hanging with Harry. It looked like some of them hated him even more now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, just sit with me\u2014us! Hermione and Ron won\u2019t mind.\u201d Harry did not meet Draco\u2019s eyes as he said those last words.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019d prefer not to disrupt my study.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry deflated. \u201cOh. Will you come to the Great Hall\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>No!</em> Draco was startled at how vehemently he sounded. <em>No. The kitchens is where the finest food </em><em>in</em><em> Hogwarts is found, after all. Why would I settle for a cold, late breakfast?</em></p>\n<p>Harry straightened. He had a strangely determined look in his eye. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go with you to the kitchens then.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>And your </em>friends<em>? </em>Draco stressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can look after themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was affronted. <em>And I can\u2019t? Potter, if you\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, no!\u201d Harry slapped a hand over his own mouth, inexplicably flushing again. \u201cJust wait for me, Malfoy.\u201d He mock-glared at Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco flopped back on his bed with a whoosh. <em>Fine, git</em>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cPrat,\u201d Harry muttered. But he peeked through the bathroom door just before closing, just to make sure Draco was still there.</p>\n<p>When Harry emerged again, Draco was still in the room, though no longer lying in bed. Instead, he sat cross-legged on top of the covers, with those weird rocks scattered in front of him.</p>\n<p>Draco actually looked surprised at Harry\u2019s presence, even if for a brief moment.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at the rocks. They glinted and sparkled and flickered with light. \u201cI\u2014if you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I do mind</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes but continued determinedly, \u201cWhat are those rocks for?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>It is none of your business, and they are </em>stones<em>, not common rocks. Scarhead</em>. Draco sniffed in a parody of hurt. Harry watched curiously as Draco lined them up along the windowsill.</p>\n<p>Draco turned back to look at him, eyebrow raised. <em>Forgotten your proclamation to accompany me down to the kitchens?</em> <em>Slow minions are </em><em>dead</em><em> minions, and all</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned back. He grabbed his already packed bag from his desk and stepped quickly to the door, opening it. \u201cAfter you, my lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked, eyes crinkling at the corners with mirth. <em>You know your place indeed, minion</em>.</p>\n<p>They made their way down the kitchens, tracing their well-used path. With the greatest luck, Harry did not encounter anyone he was obligated to talk to, and the trip felt just like the early mornings: just them.</p>\n<p>Draco was almost insufferable when the house elves procured them a proper morning tea instead of breakfast fare.</p>\n<p><em>Good grief, Harry, you might </em><em>have</em><em> a sweeter tooth than me! </em>Draco, seated directly across a suspiciously smaller table than usual, eyed Harry\u2019s plate as he picked up his cup of tea.</p>\n<p>Harry only shrugged. He had long conceded defeat in ever eating as elegantly as Draco, and he was <em>hungry</em> after Quidditch.</p>\n<p>Draco inclined his head, looking past Harry. His face smoothed, and he said casually, <em>Your friends, I assume.</em></p>\n<p>Harry quickly looked over his shoulder, but it was only Hermione\u2019s otter Patronus.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, you said that you\u2019d meet us at the Library at ten-thirty. Please send a message if something\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Well, run along, </em>Draco said dismissively.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome to the Library too, Draco,\u201d Harry insisted.</p>\n<p>Draco sipped his tea nonchalantly. <em>I already said no once, Potter.</em></p>\n<p>Harry scowled, standing up with a loud squeak from his chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco arched a brow and shot back, <em>A</em><em>nd what\u2019s gotten in</em><em>to</em><em> you now?</em></p>\n<p><em>I fancy you!</em> shouted a little corner of Harry\u2019s brain. Harry felt a flush rise unbidden, and he just <em>knew</em> that Draco noticed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, then. Be by yourself then,\u201d Harry snapped back in attempt to cover his embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes cast down. <em>Your friends are waiting, Potter</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yes, they are.\u201d Harry flung his bag over his shoulder violently. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Perhaps</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t feel like replying, opting to stomp out of the kitchens instead.</p>\n<p>The cool air hit him like a blast. He stopped, leaning against the wall. His mind, and his heart, was a bleeding mess. It was going so <em>well</em>, he and Draco, and the flying. And that meant it was going shite. He wasn\u2019t supposed to crush on Draco <em>harder</em>. But he needed to protect Draco\u2014but Draco would hate that, despite his joking at Andromeda\u2019s. How was he supposed to spend more time with Draco whilst not spending more time?</p>\n<p>Harry balled a fist, seriously thinking of punching the wall. He couldn\u2019t though, because Hermione would see his hurt hand, and she would ask and worry. He wasn\u2019t supposed to worry her. He realised that loitering outside the kitchens might make Hermione worry too. Making his next goal <em>going to the Lib</em><em>r</em><em>ary with </em>Draco, Harry finally headed to the Library.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Harry</em>,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s head whipped up, caught in the act. He tried to blink innocently. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaned forward, peering at the work laid out in front of Harry. \u201cIt must be at least the fourth time this <em>hour</em> that you\u2019ve opened up the Map and checked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014<em>no</em>.\u201d Harry crossed his arms defensively. The Map shifted about his lap. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing my Transfigurations essay, just like you wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron groaned. \u201cNah, mate. It feels like bloody sixth year again, you and that Map.\u201d Ron turned widened eyes at Harry. \u201cIt isn\u2019t...Malfoy again?\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No!</em>\u201d Harry immediately protested. He quickly rolled up the map and tucked it into his robes.</p>\n<p>Ron looked at him sceptically. \u201cI'm not so sure, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione persisted. \u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy, isn\u2019t it? I heard you had a Seeker\u2019s game with him this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ron exclaimed. Hushing sounds immediately surrounded him, and he placed a hand over his mouth guiltily.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe morning was nice. And I haven\u2019t had a game in ages,\u201d Harry said defensively.</p>\n<p>Ron nodded absently. \u201cSo, you beat him, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, a bit? The whole thing was a draw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s mouth dropped comically. \u201cA <em>draw</em>?! How the hell did Malfoy get the snitch <em>before</em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad Seeker,\u201d Harry mumbled.</p>\n<p>Hermione poked Ron before he could reply. \u201cEnough Quidditch. Library. <em>Work,</em>\u201d she said. Ron meeped and picked up his quill again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Harry said hastily. He pulled the books closer and made a show of flicking through them.</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded primly.</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, Harry excused himself to go the loo to surreptitiously check the Map again.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco wasn\u2019t at the Great Hall for lunch, but that was okay\u2014Harry checked and Draco was in the kitchens. After lunch, Harry, Hermione and Ron moved to the common room. Harry had quickly checked the Map in the toilets and found that Draco had moved to the Library.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell, Harry!\u201d Ron said, somehow making it through Harry\u2019s distracted staring at the common room exit.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron waved his hands over the chess board. \u201cYour turn. Look, if you don\u2019t want to play, just <em>tell</em> me. You\u2019ve been bloody distracted all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rubbed his eyes. \u201cSorry.\u201d He made an absent move, at which Ron snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheckmate!\u201d Ron stood up abruptly and with a familiar swish of his wand, packed up the chess game.</p>\n<p>\u201cErr, Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We</em> are going to Hermione. And <em>you</em> are going to tell us what\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed weakly, trying to diffuse the tense atmosphere. \u201cDid Hermione put you up to it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shook his head vigorously. \u201cMate, even <em>I </em>can see something\u2019s up.\u201d Ron lowered his voice. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, that I wasn\u2019t a good friend, in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014I understand why. It's okay,\u201d Harry protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make what I did any better,\u201d Ron said lowly. \u201cBut, we\u2019re friends, right? Tell us what\u2019s worrying you and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know, though?\u201d Harry said dryly. Somehow, despite Ron\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t see the topic going down well.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re going up to your room.\u201d Ron said firmly. He sent a Patronus to Hermione and led the way up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Harry trailed after him and resignedly opened the door.</p>\n<p>Ron whistled. \u201cYour room\u2019s neat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tried to look around the room with new eyes. The window curtains were fully open, and the room was bathed in the reflected light from the sky. Draco\u2019s stones lined the windowsill, spaced out evenly. Draco\u2019s side of the room was immaculate. A stack of books sat on top of Draco\u2019s table. On top of Draco\u2019s trunk was his bag of flying gear, and his broom was still leaning against the wall by the desk. Harry\u2019s bed was surprisingly neat\u2014Draco must have spelled it before they\u2019d left for morning tea. A few novels and odd bits of coloured rocks and quills littered Harry\u2019s bedside table. His trunk and wardrobe were closed, hiding away their mess inside. Harry\u2019s own desk had scattered parchments and quills\u2014it looked a <em>little</em> bit neater than Ron\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Harry said dubiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Ron insisted. His head turned towards the door, just as Hermione pushed it open.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got your message,\u201d Hermione said breathlessly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry levelled Ron a look. \u201cNothing so urgent that you had to run, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron, however, was triumphant. \u201cSo there <em>is</em> something!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione smiled, closing the door behind her. \u201cHarry? Are you ready to tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flopped down on his bed. He kind of wanted to tell them, about everything, about Draco and the Slytherins (<em>not</em> about him, he did not want to tell anyone about <em>himself</em>). But he doubted that was what they wanted to hear. He turned to them, giving them his most reassuring smile. \"It's fine, really.\"</p>\n<p>The mattress depressed slightly as Hermione sat down. \u201cHarry? We\u2019ll always be your friends, regardless,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>Harry crossed his arms. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m hiding something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron rolled his eyes. \u201cMate, sometimes I think you\u2019re always hiding something. I know you don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he added hastily, \u201cbut checking out Malfoy that often isn\u2019t exactly subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not checking him out!\u201d Harry denied hotly. His heart thudded.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened. Harry felt anticipation curl in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a lot happier lately,\u201d Hermione said, \u201cand you\u2019ve stopped sneaking out at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth opened, but he couldn\u2019t say anything at first. \u201cYou knew.\u201d It came out too much like a question for his liking.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him an exasperated look. \u201cYes, we knew. But the point is, soon after you stopped, you started taking breakfast in the kitchens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith Malfoy,\u201d Ron added helpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd? He\u2019s my roommate. McGonagall told us 'house unity' and all,\u201d Harry said stubbornly. He wasn\u2019t lying. \u201cI don\u2019t see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron stood up abruptly. Hermione started to rise, arm lifting up as though to block him, but Ron was already talking. \u201cYou know about Seamus and Dean, don\u2019t you? That they\u2019re currently seeing each other? That\u2019s why they roomed together. And you met Charlie\u2019s <em>boyfriend</em> last time at the Burrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>What?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Seamus and <em>Dean? Charlie</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cI think the Dursleys are the kind of people who are homophobic and they probably told you blatantly <em>wrong</em> information,\u201d Hermione said fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re gay, or bisexual, Harry. We\u2019ll still love you. We\u2019ll still be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s stomach dropped and he was suddenly dizzy with disgust and relief. \u201cI\u2019m not...\u201d The denial died in his throat. \u201cI...maybe I am,\u201d Harry finally whispered. His throat choked up and stupid tears started to form in his eyes. He <em>needed</em> to say that he was sorry, that he couldn\u2019t be straight like them, like what even <em>he</em> wanted to be. He was utterly unprepared for Hermione tackling him and hugging him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>The image of Hermione being his mum rose sharply in his mind and he felt embarrassed. But mostly, he felt relief that Hermione knew and could still stand to touch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ron said, as he came over and placed a warm hand on Harry's shoulder. \u201cIf the Dursleys didn\u2019t like gay people, that\u2019s all the more <em>reason</em> to be okay with it. It\u2019s like a figurative punch in their face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled weakly, and he wiped away the water in his eyes. Their friendship settled like warmth around him.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Hermione pulled back. Ron moved the desk chair closer to the bed and sat down.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Now we can talk about Malfoy,\u201d Ron said bluntly. \u201cYou fancy him, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry spluttered.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, it felt like everything was moving too fast. He\u2019d <em>just</em> come out to them and they wanted to talk about his\u2014his <em>crush</em>? At the back of his mind, he could wryly note that he wasn\u2019t surprised that they somehow knew about this too.</p>\n<p>Ron continued, ignoring Harry\u2019s very serious plight. \u201cSo, we need to figure out whether he fancies you back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry made a face but his heart traitorously fluttered at the thought of being with Draco. \u201cYou <em>want</em> me to\u2014with <em>Draco</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Ron\u2019s turn to make a face. \u201cI don\u2019t know <em>why</em> you like him, but he\u2019s not so bad any more, right? It looks like he's changed.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re on first-name basis,\u201d Hermione said shrewdly. \u201cAnd you told us that you spent some time with Parkinson and Zabini, so you\u2019re also on good terms with his friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not on good terms with <em>you,</em>\u201d Harry countered.</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s not on bad terms either. And apparently only talks to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry bit his lip, the reason <em>why</em> Draco didn't talk at the tip of his tongue, all ready to be blurted out. He had to reluctantly agree that on the outside, it did look like that. When he felt he wouldn\u2019t betray Draco\u2019s trust, he muttered, \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe apparently makes you happy,\u201d Hermione said easily. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll probably fight, but Ron and I fight sometimes too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe hated each other,\u201d Harry said, raising his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf this happened before, I would\u2019ve told you to stay away from Malfoy,\u201d Hermione admitted. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t friends already, I couldn\u2019t imagine it happening.\u201d She grinned mischievously. \u201cYou\u2019d make a good couple. Some of the girls think so, regardless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s just a bit creepy. Look, I don\u2019t want to do anything right now, alright?\u201d Never, if he had his way.</p>\n<p>Ron grinned with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, mate. How about a game of Exploding Snap?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione frowned. \u201cYou, Ronald, have not finished your Potions homework, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled at Ron\u2019s sudden caught-out expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr...\u201d Ron said weakly.</p>\n<p>In the end, Hermione roped both of them into joining her interrupted study session, and when Harry impulsively checked the Map, Hermione only smiled indulgently at him, and Ron rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry caught up with Draco just before dinner, outside the hall. Draco merely looked at him.</p>\n<p>\"About this morning, what I said\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Draco gave no response, which made Harry flounder a bit.</p>\n<p>Harry took a breath. \"You're my friend,\" he said firmly. He felt relief when Draco raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p><em>I suppose I am your friend regardless of my opinions on this matter,</em> he said dryly.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \"Yeah. Draco Malfoy, you're my friend whether you like it or not.\" He stuck his hand out. \"Now shake my hand.\"</p>\n<p>Draco's lip curled up with amusement. He nodded and solemnly shook Harry's hand.</p>\n<p>Harry made a sweeping motion towards the open door of the Great Hall. \"After you.\"</p>\n<p><em>Prat. </em>But Draco's voice was fond, and he strode into the hall first.</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco another smile before heading to the Gryffindor table.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s dreams felt nice that night. They skipped and wandered over the last few days, and Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014yeah, yeah\u2014and all those times I pretended to be you\u2014\u201d Harry was saying. \u201cI must have sounded really stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Loath as I am to say this, you are </em>not<em> an idiot. There was no reason you should have known, and I never told you, </em>Draco replied. He reached out, touching Harry lightly. <em>And I\u2014I greatly appreciate what you did. Thank you.</em></p>\n<p>Harry stared into Draco\u2019s eyes. In dreams, he felt like he had no control, and Harry tilted his head up a fraction more, feet tip-toeing slightly, as Draco leaned in, placing a hand on the small of Harry\u2019s back, and the other on Harry\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>They kissed. It didn\u2019t feel like anything definable, but Harry felt <em>good</em>. He felt <em>happy</em>.</p>\n<p>They parted. Draco smiled, just like he had on the pitch, and he leant in to kiss Harry again.</p>\n<p>The dream continued, jumping about events throughout the day. But when Harry woke, it was the kisses that he remembered.</p>\n<p>He turned his head, to watch Draco work, and he remembered his conversation with Hermione and Ron the day before. It felt like hope in his stomach, like the world was opening up for him, much like when he first learnt that he was wizard.</p>\n<p>He was <em>allowed</em> to like Draco, in the crush-or-maybe-more way. Hermione and Ron had given him the closest thing to a blessing to date Draco.</p>\n<p>Harry must have made a noise, because Draco turned around. Harry hadn\u2019t put his glasses on yet, but he could <em>feel</em> Draco\u2019s smile, feel it at the edge of his mind where the Legilimency spell connected him and Draco. And Harry had the sudden flare of realisation that Draco might like him back too.</p>\n<p>He carried on his day as normal, but it didn't stop him from smiling widely whenever Draco looked at him.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Prophet\u2019s</em> and the <em>Quibbler\u2019s </em>front page told the same story, but had starkly different headlines. The <em>Daily Prophet</em> screamed:</p>\n<p>\n<em>LIGHT WIZARD DUMBLEDORE, FAGGOT?!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco eyed the reporter\u2019s name\u2014<em>Rita Skeeter</em>\u2014and it made all the sense in the world. He felt himself rolling his eyes as he read it.</p>\n<p><em>...how it couldn\u2019t be true</em>\u2014<em>how could one of the most prominent light wizards, Albus Dumbledore, defeater of Grindelwald\u2014be a homosexual? For the greater part of fifty years, Dumbledore has been the symbol of Light, one of the greatest wizard of all time. We and our children have looked up to this wizard as a </em>role model<em>. I shudder at what this has inadvertently caused.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If only we had known that he was a poofter! For why else did he let Death Eater Severus Snape into the school? And allowed Death Eater spawn Draco Malfoy to walk the same halls as our children?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>To his credit, his life contains very little traces of a homosexual lifestyle; no, instead, he seems to advocate a life without marriage altogether. Is he so perverted that his duties provided him with </em>that sort<em> of fulfilment? To find out, be sure to keep a look out for my upcoming book\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Utter drivel, of course. Dumbledore\u2019s\u2014whatever\u2014that made Harry suffer had nothing to do with his supposed torrid romance with Grindelwald.</p>\n<p>Irritated at Skeeter's words, Draco flicked to page five and found the standard <em>A Day in the Life of Harry Potter</em> section that had appeared after the War. However, one of the students had somehow taken a grainy photo of Harry and himself flying, and what followed underneath was almost a play-by-play of their match. Draco frowned as sliver of unease settled into his stomach. He folded up the <em>Prophet</em> with the front page facing in.</p>\n<p>The <em>Quibbler</em>, which Draco knew was firmly run by Lovegood\u2019s father, and not without Lovegood\u2019s own input, said rather reasonably\u2014</p>\n<p> <em>WE HEARD THAT ALBUS DUMBLEDORE WAS GAY</em></p>\n<p>Draco scanned over it\u2014it confirmed the <em>Prophet\u2019s</em> tripe about Dumbledore being gay, and someone had obviously leaked the <em>Prophet\u2019s</em> article, because the Quibbler\u2019s was addressing it directly.</p>\n<p><em>So </em>you<em> think you could have defeated Grindelwald? Why, if Dumbledore, a gay wizard could have done it, I\u2019m sure all you heterosexual wizards and witches out there could have defeated Voldemort in your sleep. Alas, all the heterosexuals must have been missing from Britain these last fifty years.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco skimmed through the paper, but it held little interest and he folded it up again.</p>\n<p>Harry peered at them upside down across the table and frowned. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Apparently Dumbledore was gay</em>, Draco replied, pushing the papers towards Harry. <em>You can read them if you want</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s frown deepened and he regarded Draco with a strange look in his eye. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s breath caught in his throat as the dream from the previous week caught up with him again. Was he considering something with Draco, and was that the dream was reflecting some kind of reality like the previous ones? Draco had disregarded it as just a <em>dream</em>, where things happened but not as one wanted\u2014Harry had not done anything different, so he had thought it was useless to even <em>think</em> about that kind of situation occurring.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes flickered down to the papers. \u201cThat Dumbledore was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Not because he was gay, but because he was </em>Dumbledore<em> and kept favouring Gryffindors</em>, Draco allowed cautiously.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled sadly at him, but Draco didn\u2019t think it was because of him. Harry caught his eye, and shook his head as though to clear something out. Memories, Draco realised.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow's your throat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked at the topic change and lifted a hand to his neck. He hummed experimentally and it felt fine. Draco swallowed, and licked his lips before speaking. \u201cHello, Potter.\u201d His voice was a bit dry, but aside from that, it sounded like him.</p>\n<p>Harry suddenly smiled; it was utterly dazzling. \u201cHullo, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I can remove the <em>Legilimens</em> now,\u201d Draco said carefully.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco waved his wand, and it was done\u2014and regretted it immediately as he felt the loss of that connection. To cover it up, Draco decided that it was his turn to change the topic.</p>\n<p>In the most pompous tone he could gather, Draco started, \u201cNow, if you want me to look at your Potions homework...\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The revelation about Dumbledore being gay came too close to his own revelation for Harry\u2019s liking. Hermione and Ron were <em>fine</em> with it, and Draco seemed fine about it too, but the <em>Daily Prophet</em> was <em>not</em> fine with it. Harry couldn\u2019t understand it: Ron and Draco were both pureblood\u2014that would mean that liking other boys was fine in wizarding Britain, didn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>But the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, the bane of his life now that Voldemort was gone and Draco was no longer his arch-rival, was a mass publication and would share the view of the majority of its readership.</p>\n<p>And they didn\u2019t like it. They thought it was wrong. The Dursleys had thought it wrong too: to be gay was something even <em>worse</em> than a freak. Harry had a sinking feeling that he wasn\u2019t okay, that Hermione was lying and that being gay wasn't something normal after all.</p>\n<p>And just like his fears about Voldemort became true, so did these.</p>\n<p>The school buzzed with the news and it seemed to be the only topic anyone talked about. The upper years, those who could remember Dumbledore, seemed to exalt in their position, sending tales, true or otherwise, into the ears of the lower years.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dumbledore\u2019s gay!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Can you believe it\u2014he was a shirt-lifter!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck, I always knew there was something weird about him.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Harry sat miserably at the Gryffindor table, trying and failing to cut out the noise. Across the Hall, Draco looked as unfazed at everything as ever, and Harry wanted to sit in that calm that surround him. He wanted Draco\u2019s Legilimency spell, so that Draco could talk to him. He wanted even more to go to the kitchens for lunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Harry,\u201d some sixth-year Gryffindor said, catching Harry\u2019s attention across the table.</p>\n<p>Harry forced his gaze away from Draco. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hung \u2018round Dumbledore a lot. Does that mean you knew he was gay?\u201d The boy gave Harry a rather piercing stare.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2014no\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione glared at the boy. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d she snapped. \u201cDiscriminating on orientation is as bad as discriminating on blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy looked sour, but he turned away from them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Hermione whispered into Harry\u2019s ear. She gripped his arm and it felt like an anchor. \u201cIt\u2019s always the voice of the dissenters that sound loudest, even if they aren\u2019t the majority.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and smiled, and Hermione released her grip. For a little while, Harry believed her.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t stop his ears picking up comments on their own, just before a Professor came into class, or during that time when Harry was in the thick of students rushing to the next class, or during dinner when relief of the day's end made students chatter even louder.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFuck, can you believe we had a poof for a headmaster?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry quelled the urge to rant and defend Dumbledore. <em>Yes</em>, he did things Harry didn\u2019t like, but in the end, Voldemort died.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDidya think Dumbledore turned Harry Potter gay?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wait\u2014what if he did?</p>\n<p>Ron heard that comment too though, and he scoffed at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine Charlie was here,\u201d he whispered to Harry. \u201cHe\u2019d terrify them so much that they\u2019d piss in their pants. Someone thought Charlie had \u2018turned gay\u2019 because he worked in a dragon reserve surround mostly by guys. I don\u2019t know what Charlie did, but that idiot was jumpy for <em>weeks</em>.\u201d Ron shook his head. \u201cLearnt the hard way that you can\u2019t turn someone gay. You know, maybe we could call Charlie now...\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed weakly. \u201cThat would be funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHey, think about this! So, Dumbledore was gay, and he defeated Grindelwald. Harry Potter defeated Voldemort\u2014you think Potter\u2019s gay too?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry panicked when he heard that, and Hermione and Ron hadn\u2019t heard it, so they couldn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s not natural for Harry Potter to not have a girlfriend. He can have any girl he wants, after all.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>A few students approached him directly, alone and without Ron or Hermione.</p>\n<p>\"Are you gay?\" they asked, bluntly, and with a snide look on their face.</p>\n<p>Harry forced himself to meet their gazes and chuckle. \"Oh, of course not,\" he said, faking, denying, <em>lying</em>.</p>\n<p>They gave him such a look of relief. \"Thank Merlin you're not weird too! It's so disgusting, right?\"\n</p>\n<p>Harry felt himself slipping, and he could do nothing to stop it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed early,\u201d he told Hermione and Ron weakly. They had sat down for less than an hour in the common room to work, but even here there was talk. Maybe not about him, because most of the Eighth Years knew him \u2018well enough\u2019, but about Dumbledore. It was better, because Ron was right about Dean and Seamus, who flipped off anyone who thought being gay was bad. But Harry didn\u2019t feel well enough to continue acting <em>normal</em>.</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded, sighing. \u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best. Do you want us to come up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>that</em> badly off,\u201d he said as lightly as he could.</p>\n<p>Ron rose from his seat to clap Harry reassuringly on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione smiled. \u201cSweet dreams, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded, and refrained from dashing up the stairs. He got ready for bed quickly and flung himself on the bed so hard that his head felt dizzy.</p>\n<p>He knew what was rational and what wasn\u2019t. Hermione and Ron didn't care about what Harry's preferences were, assuming they weren't lying to him. The Weasleys wouldn\u2019t care. Seamus and Dean wouldn\u2019t care. Draco wouldn\u2019t care. And the wizarding world, the media and the fucking <em>Daily Prophet</em> had spat crap about him before, they'd care, but they weren\u2019t his friends or adopted family. Rationally, he knew that they didn\u2019t matter, not much at all, compared to those close to him. But no matter how <em>rational</em> about it he wanted to be, there was nothing he could do to stop the feeling of disgust and despair inside of him.</p>\n<p>He liked Draco <em>so much</em>. Liked spending time with him, talking to him, making him laugh. And that was <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n<p><em>In the end, the Dursleys were right, weren't they? I\u2019m a freak. I\u2019m disgusting. I just want to be </em>normal<em>, but I never will be</em>. Harry curled into a ball and tried to sleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It started off as usual. He was in the Forbidden Forest. It was cold and he didn\u2019t know how his feet kept moving and he was prepared to die. The snitch was in his hand\u2014the Resurrection Stone. His heart ached, as he watched his parents, Sirius, and Remus emerge. It was a dream, he knew, but he wanted to say something different, to tell them something different, but all he could ask was if it hurt.</p>\n<p>Guilt clogged his throat as the dream warped.</p>\n<p>They were telling him it <em>was all his fault, because he was a bloody sissy.</em> Harry tried to protest, but the dream wouldn\u2019t let him.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWalk to your death, Harry,\u201d</em> they said in one voice. <em>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can atone for your mistakes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>They disappeared, the Resurrection Stone burning in his hand. His feet kept walking, already knowing the way. But this time, the Dementors approached, and everything became colder, icy, frozen. The Death Eaters saw him, Voldemort was there\u2014</p>\n<p>In his dreams, Draco always approached from behind, and when warmth enveloped him, Harry knew it was him. Draco was humming, but Harry\u2019s eyes were on Voldemort. Voldemort, who raised his wand, where the silvery forms of James, Lily, Sirius and Remus emerged, and they said in one voice,</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou were too weak, Harry. Walk to your death.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry tried to step forward. It was his <em>destiny to die</em>, but Draco obviously didn\u2019t know that, because the arms just gripped tighter. Harry thrashed, his voice suddenly freed. \u201cLet me <em>go</em>, Draco! I need to die! I have to!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco just hugged him tighter\u2014<em>hugged</em> him! And when Draco\u2019s fingers stroked Harry\u2019s hair, his whole body felt warm\u2014it felt so good, so good that Harry had to fight back a sob.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014not\u2014let me go, Draco!\u201d Harry threw himself forward, and forced\u2014<em>forced</em> his eyes to open, to <em>wake up</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Night-time.</p>\n<p>Everything glowed a faint silver. His face was pressed against heat, arms encircled him. Harry was warm and safe. It had just been a dream.</p>\n<p>He looked up, and the blond hair, the face.</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s not a dream!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Disgust at himself came over him in a rush and he <em>hated</em> Draco, hated that he would feel <em>safe</em> like this. Harry raised his arms and pushed, violently untangling his legs from Draco\u2019s, scrambled away from the comforting (<em>why? Why is it\u2014?</em>) circle of Draco\u2019s arms. In his haste, he stumbled as his feet hit the cool floor, and he almost fell.</p>\n<p>The light from the stones on Draco\u2019s bedside table caught the silver in Draco\u2019s eyes as they opened, blinking slowly. Harry\u2019s heart thumped, and his whole body tensed, ready to run or fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>*</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco rose rather languidly from sleep. For a moment, he thought he was still dreaming, and he called out softly to Harry, with the intent of soothing him back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Harry spluttered. \u201cWhat the fuck, Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood rushed and Draco\u2019s head spun as he sat up. Harry stood before him, partially lit by Draco\u2019s moonstones and star stones. Harry stood there <em>awake</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck fuck fuck.</em> This was it. The end.</p>\n<p>Harry took a step back. \u201cWhy was I in your bed, Draco?\u201d he snarled.</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes, trying to breathe evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this some <em>prank</em>, to make me feel\u2014\u201d Harry\u2019s voice came to a strangled stop.</p>\n<p>Harry was staring intently at him when Draco\u2019s eyes opened again, the green of his eyes shiny in the gloom\u2014hurt, fear, confusion. Draco had decided long ago that he\u2019d tell Harry the truth, if Harry found out.</p>\n<p>Now Draco decided to actually do so. He clung to the hope that Harry really did <em>like</em> him. Because Draco suddenly realised <em>he</em> liked Harry more-than-a-friend.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed. He would have to speak out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was never my intention to hurt you,\u201d Draco started lowly. He licked his lips, mouth feeling too dry.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes rolled minutely, a bit of fire coming back.</p>\n<p>Draco smiled wryly. \u201cWell, not anymore. Not since you saved me from Azkaban.\u201d Draco wanted to add, <em>as much as I hate to admit</em>, but he did not think that would make Harry laugh.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. His eyes flickered away from Draco, so he waited patiently until Harry\u2019s eyes fixed on him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou started sleepwalking following your fall in Defence, more than a month ago. You were having nightmares, and stumbling asleep into my bed. I took you back to your own bed at first,\u201d Draco added. \u201cBut eventually I decided it wasn\u2019t worth the bother, and just let you stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have woken me up,\u201d Harry retorted. He took a few steps around the space, his back closer to the far wall. \u201cYou should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Draco shot back. \u201cYou would have hexed first\u2014I\u2019ve seen you jump out of bed as though you were under attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closed his eyes. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d he said with a strained voice. \u201cWe weren\u2019t friends, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt helped you sleep,\u201d Draco replied simply. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t selflessness that made me do it. After all, I owe you at least two life debts, and I hoped that this would repay one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scowled abruptly and turned his head away in a sharp motion. \u201cIs that it,\u201d he said flatly.</p>\n<p>Draco flinched. \u201cNo.\u201d Harry turned his head back sharply and Draco hurried to continue. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stepped forward. His magic swirled around him, prickling against Draco\u2019s skin. \u201cYeah? Then what? You care for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you git!\u201d Draco snapped back. He swept back his covers and stood up, meeting Harry face to face. \u201cYou bloody grew on me, and it was fucking annoying at first because you were so bloody <em>you</em>, but then you started pretending to talk for me and flying with me! So, Merlin help <em>me,</em> but if letting you sleep in my bed helped <em>you</em>, I\u2019ll do it again!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco breathed heavily with all his emotions broken free. He gave Harry the most intense look he could, instead of screaming and shouting and stomping like part of him wanted to.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened, and his magic drew back, just a bit. But he did not speak.</p>\n<p>Draco growled with frustration. \u201cI somehow entered your dreams, you know. I don\u2019t know if you remember them.\u201d Draco pitched his voice quieter, but it still drew out a stronger reaction from Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry punched him in the gut. \u201cFuck! It <em>was</em> you after all!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gasped and kicked him back in the leg. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I knew why!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m Harry-fucking-Potter,\u201d Harry minced out. \u201cWhat did you see? What do you <em>want</em> from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and your Muggles.\u201d Draco gritted his teeth. \u201cFucking saw them lock you in your fucking cupboard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry recoiled. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I wanted to hurt them. Why the fuck don't you <em>hate</em> all Muggles?\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry felt exposed and naked under Draco\u2019s glare. Draco had seen him. His childhood with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t supposed to <em>matter</em> anymore. They were supposed to be insignificant in the face of Voldemort and the memories of the last seven years.</p>\n<p>Harry narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou pitied me. You fucking thought I was weak and pitiful and then you <em>had</em> to do something, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s lips pulled into a snarl. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t pity me? The lonely Death Eater with no friends? Only fit to be ignored or cursed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d But Harry knew that Draco was right, and so did Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like that at first,\u201d Draco said nastily. \u201cBut then we became friends and it wasn\u2019t, <em>right</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d Harry cut in. He slashed at the air, frustrated. \u201cYou were <em>awake</em>. You could have pushed me away if wanted. I\u2014I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes widened and he deflated abruptly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Draco's eyes averted. \u201cI should have woken you. I should have told you. I\u2019m a coward. I can never do anything right, can I? Everything eventually goes to shit. I was a fucking idiot to think this would somehow go differently.\u201d Draco laughed bitterly. \u201cYou have every right to be angry.\u201d He made a choking sound, but forced out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had to blink, for in a whirl of sound, sense and scent, all the songs that <em>Draco</em> had sung to him came back.</p>\n<p>Their early mornings, chocolates and flying. Unwilling, Harry\u2019s heart clenched, as his eyes roamed over Draco\u2019s defeated posture.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Harry whispered.</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. \u201cSomething I don\u2019t deserve. There are better people for you out there. <em>You</em> deserve it, after everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can. You can have what you want,\u201d Harry said before he could think.</p>\n<p>Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry sardonically. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, and he took a step closer to Draco. A sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ran up his spine, as the proximity forced him to tilt his head up slightly to meet Draco\u2019s eyes. \u201cI do. I don\u2019t care about the public.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I shouldn\u2019t care about the public</em>, he amended silently. He was going to try harder, so that one day, he really wouldn't be fazed by the sensationalist words of a newspaper with a bad record.</p>\n<p>He placed a firm hand on Draco\u2019s arm, acting braver than he felt. \u201cHermione and Ron already know, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them. And you\u2019ve been in my dreams. You <em>know</em> what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s free arm lifted hesitantly and his hand came to rest at the back of Harry\u2019s head. Harry shivered at the tingle of contact. \u201cIf this happens, it cannot be undone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quirked an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, scared, Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s growl was the only warning before his other arm snaked around Harry\u2019s waist and drew him flush against him. Harry gasped just as Draco brought their mouths together.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the gentle kisses Harry had dreamed about <em>at all</em>. Their teeth knocked together in a flare of pain that made Harry open his mouth wider, and Draco nibbled on Harry's bottom lip. Harry felt like swaying as Draco's tongue smoothed over his lip and slowly, <em>slowly</em> entered his mouth. His tongue was rough as it caressed Harry\u2019s and the utter bliss pushed down the urge to choke. And when Harry tightened his grip on Draco\u2019s arms, it was all heat.</p>\n<p>The heat on his back where Draco\u2019s hand pressed and roamed, the heat on the back of his neck and scalp where Draco\u2019s fingers were tangled with his hair. The burning of their thighs, torsos and fucking <em>cocks</em> pressed together even through the layers of clothing. The hot and wet of their mouths as Draco\u2019s tongue touched and caressed and thrust. Harry moaned and gave in. His heart thumped, the lack of oxygen made him dazed. He wanted to melt, and he wasn't entirely sure he wouldn't.</p>\n<p>A warmth welled in Harry's chest as Draco withdrew gently, stroking his tongue one last time, and pressing a closed-lip kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry said, running a hand up Draco\u2019s arm just to make sure everything was still solid. He could feel a sense of shame, lurking somewhere deep, but he forced himself to focus on Draco instead.</p>\n<p>Draco's mouth curved into a smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck off. Is all you think about is sex?\u201d Harry gave Draco a slight push away.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s arms fell away from Harry and he took a half step back until the back of his legs pressed up against the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking about going to sleep,\u201d Draco said cautiously. \u201cOn my bed\u2014but only if you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cMerlin, you don\u2019t have to treat me like glass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes and stood straighter. He ran an agitated hand through his hair and half turned away. \u201cFuck being nice to you then.\u201d He climbed back onto his bed and under the covers.</p>\n<p>Harry stood at the end of the bed hesitantly; Draco\u2019s eyes were closed and he wasn\u2019t saying anything. <em>I\u2019ll probably just sleepwalk into Draco\u2019s bed though</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco groaned, and pulled the covers back. \u201cHurry up, Potter. Quit bloody looming and get in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned and jumped in, making Draco\u2019s eyes open with surprise as the bed suddenly dipped.</p>\n<p>Draco glared at him, but quickly sighed defeat. Harry fumbled a bit to get under the covers. He lay down close enough to touch Draco, but far enough that they weren\u2019t touching.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Harry looked up at the bed\u2019s canopy, silver grey in the moonlight. The <em>view</em> was odd, but when he closed his eyes, the<em> feeling</em> was familiar.</p>\n<p>His eyes snapped open when he heard something coming from Draco. He turned his head, but Draco was looking away. And then Harry recognised the hum and the soft words.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you, my darling. I\u2019ll place the stars for you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closed his eyes and slid gently into sleep.</p>\n<p>When Harry woke up, it just dawn and the sky was a beautiful array of colours. For once, he didn\u2019t have that feeling that something was off, because he was there, in Draco\u2019s bed; and somehow during the night, he and Draco had closed the distance.</p>\n<p>Draco was already awake, head angled to a book floating above the bed and absently running his hand through Harry\u2019s hair. A shiver of warmth went through him.</p>\n<p>Draco turned, a smile, free, on his face. \u201cGood morning, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled back. \u201cYou\u2019re not grouchy in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco arched an eyebrow and smirked. \u201cIf grouchy turns you on, I can certainly be grouchy to you <em>all the time</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Memories of the kiss\u2014the <em>snog</em>\u2014flooded back and Harry flushed. \u201cI guess I really am gay then,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Cho Chang and Ginevra Weasley?\u201d Draco scoffed. \u201cYou certainly looked smitten then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Pansy Parkinson?\u201d Harry countered.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy best friend,\u201d Draco scowled.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who started it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco poked Harry in the arm. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to hint, Potter, is that there\u2019s no need to box yourself in with Muggle words. Merlin, we even go shagging other <em>species</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wriggled in the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d He turned his head to Draco. \u201c<em>Thinking? That must be a first for you, Potty.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco opened his mouth, ready to protest, but Harry cut in again.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>For Merlin\u2019s sake, is that the best you can come up with? Something original, perhaps?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Draco muttered. He drew his wand, flicked the curtains back and rose smoothly from the bed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve stopped bickering with yourself, it\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Harry made no move to get up though, content watching Draco enter the bathroom first.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Harry caught sight of the newspapers that were delivered to Draco, he felt his heart skip a beat. The <em>Daily Prophet</em> was still writing about Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't understand,\u201d Harry mumbled under his breath, just trying to get the feelings <em>out</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Prophet?\u201d Draco looked up from the <em>Quibbler</em>. \u201cWhat's there to understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gestured at the paper. \u201cYou don't mind that...and Ron and Hermione don't. Then why does the Prophet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. \u201cSkeeter, of course. Judging on her history, she no doubt lives on scandals, both figuratively and literally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014<em>why</em> is it a scandal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. \u201cYou expect me to understand the thoughts and feelings of the wizarding public?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scowled. Draco seemed to be willfully obtuse.</p>\n<p>Draco looked back impassively, but he lowered his newspaper. \u201cYou do not want to be seen with me in public,\u201d he said flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2014not in a close way.\u201d Harry ruffled his hair, agitated when Draco continued looking at him blankly. \u201cI want to wait until all <em>this</em> dies down first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are willing to be in a...a <em>secret</em> relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled weakly. \u201cIs that what we have? A relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco's lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cI assumed you understood what I meant last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cMerlin, why are we fighting <em>already</em>? Just, let me talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco inclined his head slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to keep <em>us</em>\u201d\u2014Harry felt a smile forming at the thought, but Draco didn't twitch\u2014\u201cquiet, for now. Maybe, just a few people. People I\u2014we know. Hermione and Ron already know that I sort of fancy you, so I want to tell them. And the Weasleys, eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother, and Pansy,\u201d Draco said softly.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. \u201cIf they promise not to tell anyone else\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can keep secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will have a mostly secretly relationship then.\u201d Draco finally gave Harry something of a smile, but Harry detected a defeated edge to it.</p>\n<p>Harry's heart pounded as he thought of what he was going to do next. Draco was looking away again\u2014Harry reached over and gripped Draco's arm, pulling him closer, turning him round to face Harry again. He brought his other hand up to Draco's cheek. He saw the brief grey of Draco's widened eyes before his own eyes fluttered closed and he placed a kiss on Draco's mouth.</p>\n<p>Harry's mind blanked momentarily at the gentleness of it all. Drawing away, Harry <em>had</em> to marvel about how they had gone from enemies to <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's two,\u201d Harry realised.</p>\n<p>Draco gave Harry a weird look. \u201cTwo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo kisses. Dream kisses don't count.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco straightened. \u201cAnd as the Saviour of our illustrious world, I suspect you demand more of them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cYou're the Malfoy. I thought <em>you</em> would demand more. Maybe a million. Or a billion. Some ridiculously large number that's better than anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco's mouth slowly curved into a smirk. \u201cAre you willing to be my personal kiss-dispenser?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, that sounds gross.\u201d Harry's forehead wrinkled, but his lips grinned against his will.</p>\n<p>Draco laughed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked at Hermione quizzically. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione glanced around the common room furtively, before leaning in and whispering, \u201cI tried to convince Rita Skeeter to retract her statements. But she's apparently registered as an animagus already.\u201d Hermione\u2019s mouth twisted into a grimace. \u201cI checked, she really has.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tried to give Hermione a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Malfoy say something about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushed, and he could tell Hermione noticed because her eyes widened. \u201cHe...he fancies me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be private, for now,\u201d Harry added. But he was already having second thoughts about that.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave Harry a thoughtful look. \u201cAre you going to tell Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded to herself, eyes already flicking away in thought. \u201cI\u2019ll probably need to give you the talk, then. I\u2019ll find you some books\u2014it\u2019s different between two men\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd of course, we\u2019ll have to meet Malfoy properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cHe might not want to meet you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. \u201cDid he want to keep it a secret?\u201d She asked sharply.</p>\n<p>Harry winced. \u201cNo.\u201d Now, he regretted that decision. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione frowned. \u201c<em>Harry</em>, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult now, <em>Hermione</em>.\u201d Harry replied stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Draco about meeting you tomorrow morning, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded, and dropped the subject, but she still looked mildly reprimanding. <em>Like an overprotective big sister</em><span>, Harry mused.</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s hand immediately went to his wand, but it was Granger. He set the book in his other hand back on the table and turned to face her. Professor Vector, at the front of the classroom, gave them a curious glance but otherwise left them alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cGranger,\u201d he replied. It was only out the sense of dire courteousness that he spoke\u2014he had had a faint hope of not speaking in public for the rest of the school year and thus avoid having that particular curse cast on him the <em>third</em> time.</p>\n<p>Granger already had her book bag slung over one shoulder. \u201cCan I speak with you, just outside the classroom?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Harry must have told her something</em>. Draco nodded slightly. \u201cYes.\u201d He slipped the last book into his bag and followed Granger out of the classroom.</p>\n<p>Granger turned to him with an apologetic look. \u201cActually, I need to talk to you in private.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSilencing spell,\u201d Draco replied monotonically. He was already starting to feel irritated.</p>\n<p>Granger quickly cast it. After nodding to herself, she finally spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s about Harry.\u201d Granger looked at him expectantly, but Draco did not offer anything. \u201cHas he talked to you about joining us for Saturday study?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger started to become flustered. \u201cWill you, then? Harry already told us about your relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I will.\u201d He will go, because he wanted the slightest chance that <em>this</em> would actually work out, instead of twisting and becoming shit like everything else. Harry wanted secrecy and closed doors, but that he had named Granger as one of the few he wanted to tell <em>and</em> actually told her gave Draco a glimmer of hope that Harry did mean to follow through.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Granger smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet in the common room after breakfast first and proceed to the library from there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>Granger became stern. \u201cLook, Malfoy, if you want to be Harry\u2019s boyfriend, you'll be in our company often. For Harry\u2019s sake, we\u2019re going to try to be friends, but friendship only works both ways, so if we\u2019re going to make an effort, you should too.\u201d Her magic flared out, just a bit, and Draco idly wondered if it was some Gryffindor thing. \u201cIf you wanted a <em>fling</em> with Harry, then you drop it <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p> <em>How unbelievable idiotic would it be to involve myself in a fling with Britain\u2019s Golden Boy?</em></p>\n<p>Draco said lowly, \u201cI fully understand the requirement of your friendship.\u201d He met her eyes firmly, rolling the words in his mind before he spoke. \u201cI apologise for my past behaviour, and I apologise for my actions, or lack thereof, during the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger blinked, as though she was surprised to hear it. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Apology accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco tried for a little smile: it seemed like something Harry always did. \u201cAfter all, you have proved yourself to be the brightest student in our year.\u201d</p>\n<p>To his success, Granger softened. \u201cThanks. Call me Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then, Draco.\u201d She cancelled the silencing ward.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger left briskly, while Draco made a more cautious scan of the surrounding students. One of them caught his eye, a familiar student. The boy looked at him and then disappeared into the throng of other students exiting classrooms after the school day.</p>\n<p>Draco had been seen speaking.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Draco fell into Harry\u2019s dreams, he realised Harry must have either crawled into bed with him, or had sleepwalked in.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s dreams were jagged snippets. Draco was detached, float-walking behind Harry as the dreams traced through Harry\u2019s days. He felt a brief surge of joy when Harry dreamt of their early morning kisses.</p>\n<p>Then, the kitchens faded into the bustling Great Hall, and the swell of noise all seemed to speak together in a chanting of voices.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDumbledore\u2019s gay!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCan you believe it\u2014he was a shirt-lifter!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFuck, I always knew there was something weird about him.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco felt like sneering at the voices, things Draco had heard all day long and was rather sick of, but Harry in the centre just looked with widening eyes. Draco approached him, tried to comfort him; but Harry made a noise of distress, pushing Draco away, but then reached out to pull him closer again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Harry was saying under his breath.</p>\n<p>The image shifted\u2014just a blur of colours now, the press of bodies. What Draco heard next was new.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo you think Dumbledore turned Harry Potter into a poof?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cExplains why Harry Potter isn\u2019t dating any girls\u2014he could have anyone!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry shrunk before Draco\u2019s eyes, and Harry was a little boy again. His uncle and cousin loomed, larger than life.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDon\u2019t be a sissy, boy,\u201d</em> the older Muggle sneered.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat, was Cedric your boyfriend? Always knew you were a freak,\u201d</em> the younger one said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Little-Harry tilted his head up to regard Draco briefly, before his head dipped down again. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fine. Dwaco, I\u2019m not a freak, am I?\u201d he said quietly, muffled by the folds of Draco\u2019s robes.</p>\n<p>Draco petted Harry\u2019s head. This was a conversation that Draco needed to have with Harry again when he was awake, not when only Draco was fully cognisant.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Draco replied gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Little-Harry mumbled. He burrowed further into Draco's robes.</p>\n<p>The dream changed, and Draco returned to singing.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco rolled over and woke fully. Harry was curled up along his side, and Draco\u2019s fingers automatically went to Harry\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Harry was source of contradictions and an overwhelming sense of helplessness. He made Draco feel\u2014anger, and affection, and lust. Draco didn\u2019t <em>want</em> to. He wanted to remain amongst his family and childhood friends. He didn\u2019t want to let in someone new\u2014Harry Potter, no less. The more people he interacted with, the more dangerous it would be for him, the more likely his guard would drop.</p>\n<p>Draco felt helpless. When Harry Potter did not want to be his friend, Draco was not his friend; when Harry Potter wanted to be his friend, Draco became his friend; when Harry Potter wanted Draco to be his boyfriend, Draco became his boyfriend. <em>Everything</em> was done according to Harry\u2019s will.</p>\n<p>He felt a little guilty. He had thought Harry wanted to keep it a secret because it was <em>Draco</em>, the only true Death Eater allowed to roam free. It seemed impossible that Harry could still think that liking other guys could be wrong. But then, it seemed impossible that Harry could have had a shit childhood. And the Daily Prophet\u2014Draco felt like sneering, and in another time, he'd have gotten his father to sue them. Harry was supposed to be inhuman, the perfect hero. <em>And he is strong</em>, Draco reminded himself. He hadn\u2019t become bitter. He had killed the Dark Lord, and saved the world\u2014which, at times, <em>hated</em> him.</p>\n<p>Harry stirred. Draco stilled his hand, and Harry nuzzled upwards against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes still closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d Draco whispered.</p>\n<p>Harry murmured incomprehensibly. Draco resumed stroking Harry\u2019s hair and watched as Harry drifted back to sleep.</p>\n<p><em>And he trusts me</em>. That was the crux of it, was it not?\u2014that somehow, Harry believed him deserving of trust.</p>\n<p>And for that, Draco would try to hold onto this gift that he did not truly deserve.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Granger and Weasley were waiting for them in the common room, after he and Harry returned from the kitchens.</p>\n<p>Granger greeted them with a smile. \u201cHarry. Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Hermione.\u201d Harry replied cheerfully.</p>\n<p>Draco inclined his head. \u201cHermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley stepped forward. He looked between Harry and Granger, before putting his hand forward to Draco. \u201cRon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco an encouraging nudge. \u201cDraco,\u201d Draco said, as he shook Weasley\u2019s hand. Weasley didn\u2019t hide\u2014or failed to hide\u2014the look of relief when Draco let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Granger nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Library.\u201d</p>\n<p>They formed pairs when they left the tower and, to Draco\u2019s surprise, Granger placed herself next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re here, Draco. I\u2019ll finally have someone to talk to about Arithmancy and Ancient Runes.\u201d She shot the two in front of him an exasperated look. \u201cThey simply don\u2019t understand knowledge for the sake of it.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>And I\u2019ll have someone to talk to at all</em>, a tiny part of Draco thought snidely.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you started the Charms mid-semester project yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have,\u201d Draco allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee!\u201d Granger said loudly. Draco frowned, but realised she wasn\u2019t talking to him. Granger hurried forward slightly and touched Harry and Weasley in the back. \u201cDraco\u2019s started the project too!\u201d Harry and Weasley parted to let Granger through the middle, and thus they became the Golden Trio.</p>\n<p>Draco felt the distance between him and them increase.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not due until way after the Christmas hols, Hermione,\u201d Weasley whined. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it during the hols, not now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRonald Weasley, you know perfectly well that you <em>never</em> do homework during the holidays!\u201d Granger said sternly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll do it after. I don\u2019t think Flitwick even expects us to have started it\u2014we haven\u2019t even learnt everything we need yet!\u201d Weasley protested.</p>\n<p>Granger folded her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s taught you enough for you to <em>start</em> it. The whole point is for it to be a progressive sort of project that you <em>build</em> upon, not pull together during the last week.\u201d She turned to Harry. \u201cHow about <em>you</em>, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry took a step away. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll start it before Christmas?\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you and Draco to help me.\u201d He turned his head and shot Draco a smile.</p>\n<p>Draco raised an eyebrow back and was shocked when Harry grabbed his hand, drawing him into the now row of four eighth years\u2014taking up the majority of the corridor. Harry quickly dropped his hand and Draco missed the warmth immediately.</p>\n<p>He debated silently about whose wrath he could more easily take, and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be your work, not mine or\u2014Hermione\u2019s,\u201d remembering at the last second to use Granger\u2019s given name.</p>\n<p>Granger nodded vigorously. \u201cPrecisely! I won\u2019t always be there to help you, or be able to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh, Merlin,</em> Draco realised that he might end up being forced to be friends with Granger by bonding over school work.</p>\n<p>They arrived at the Library earlier than Draco was used to. Granger immediately took the lead, heading towards one of the larger square tables further back. Draco found himself manoeuvred to sit next to Granger, with Harry directly opposite him.</p>\n<p>Weasley looked plaintively at Granger. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard for you to help us if you sit over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger grinned back. \u201cHmm, that\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco ignored their bickering, taking out his work. He was mildly surprised to find that the Golden Trio could work quietly, for when he stood up to search for a book half an hour later, the three were all industriously working away\u2014even Weasley. Granger gave him a quick nod, which he returned before heading towards the shelves.</p>\n<p>The low hum of talking deeper in the Library put Draco on alert. He withdrew his wand and proceeded towards the sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were using that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, maybe <em>I</em> want to use it instead\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a first year book. <em>You\u2019re</em> not in first year!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco could make the two little Slytherins through the gaps in the shelves. An older Ravenclaw was holding up one of the textbooks, too high for them to reach\u2014most likely with a grip too strong for a summoning charm to work.</p>\n<p>He forced back a sigh and walked towards the shelves closest to them. Charms books\u2014at least he could form a truthful-sounding excuse for being in the area. He did not look at them, at first, but <em>they</em> immediately stopped talking and turned to look at him.</p>\n<p>He looked over at them lazily, letting his eyes fall on the book the Ravenclaw was holding up. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cGoshawk, Grade 1? I'm surprised that a Ravenclaw would fail First Year Charms,\u201d he drawled.</p>\n<p>The Ravenclaw tensed, sneering back. The kid slapped the book back down on the table and took a step towards Draco, wand drawn. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they let <em>you</em> back into Hogwarts at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco took a step towards the further shelves, away from the Slytherins. \u201cAs am I,\u201d he lied. \u201cI must ask Harry Potter about that. After all, he was the one who testified for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he expected, the Ravenclaw startled at the name, eyes narrowing dangerously. By then, Draco had already half turned away and was looking at the books. With a quiet exhale, he shifted towards the next bookshelf, as though he could not find what he was looking for.</p>\n<p>The Ravenclaw followed. Draco slipped into yet another aisle, heading back towards the Golden Trio\u2014relative safety, he realised.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d Granger asked.</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. At the corner of his eye, he saw the Ravenclaw hesitate, scowl, and turn away.</p>\n<p>Granger frowned. \u201cWhat did you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBooks detailing the interplay between Charms and Ancient Runes\u2014I recalled seeing something of that form before, but was unable to find anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger\u2019s frowned deepened. \u201cNo, there is\u2014I\u2019ve read them. Wait here, I\u2019ll go find them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded, grateful in more ways than one. If Granger could want to befriend him, she would not stand for the mistreatment of Slytherins.</p>\n<p>Harry looked at him suspiciously. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. \u201cPotter, there is nothing wrong with my work, but perhaps you should check yours again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes and pushed his work towards Draco. \u201cCorrect it for me, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I want something in return?\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley suddenly choked and his face reddened.</p>\n<p>Both Draco and Harry turned to face him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron looked around furtively, before whispering, \u201cI don\u2019t mind you guys together but <em>please</em> don\u2019t flirt in front of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushed as red as Weasley and looked back towards Draco nervously. \u201cThat was flirting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Potter, I was merely hinting at monetary compensation. Ten Galleons a page, depending on the legibility of your hand writing,\u201d Draco said seriously.</p>\n<p>Harry quickly lost his flush and nudged Weasley. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley rolled his eyes. \u201cMate, it was flirting, and that sounded like a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco leaned across the table. \u201cOh, you <em>haven't</em> seen flirting yet, Ronald Weasley.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley squeaked. \u201cYou know I\u2019m with Hermione, right?\u201d he said quickly.</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. \u201cAre you sure she wouldn\u2019t mind watching? Or perhaps a foursome...\u201d Weasley was quickly turning as red as his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione!\u201d Weasley said loudly, jumping out of his chair. He hurried towards Granger who had just emerged.</p>\n<p>She looked at him bemusedly. \u201cI missed you, too,\u201d she said, smiling.</p>\n<p>Harry gave a surprised laugh, and after a moment, Draco grinned back.</p>\n<p>Someone slipped him a note during dinner. It had to be one of the Slytherins\u2014no one else came near him, and it was unfamiliar enough that he knew it wasn\u2019t Granger, Weasley, or Harry. When he stood up to leave the Great Hall, four Slytherins followed him out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy,\u201d the smallest of them started.</p>\n<p>Draco suppressed his instinct to glare condescendingly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Felicity said differently\u201d\u2014<em>ah, that seventh year</em>\u2014\u201cbut we want to say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave them an impassive look. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. You understand that a large portion of this is <em>my</em> fault to begin with?\u201d he said lowly.</p>\n<p>The Slytherins shifted, but their spokesperson met Draco\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, still, we\u2014can you please teach us how to defend ourselves? We\u2019ve seen you\u2014and it\u2019s not as though we can attend Harry Potter\u2019s duelling club.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked in surprise. <em>Teaching them</em>. He doubted Harry would mind Slytherins joining the club, but the other students wouldn\u2019t make them welcome. No, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you say it was largely your fault...doesn't that mean you have some form of debt to <em>us,</em> then?\u201d the girl added slyly.</p>\n<p>Draco raised an eyebrow, and feeling very <em>Harry</em>, he said, \u201cIf you are willing, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>All four sets of eyes widened simultaneously\u2014it was quite comical. \u201c<em>Really</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the kitchens, most likely. A suitable time needs to picked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cB-but we don\u2019t know where the kitchens are! No one\u2019s shown us!\u201d</p>\n<p>At this, Draco frowned inwardly. The older years <em>should</em> have told them\u2014there was a shortcut near the Slytherin dungeons.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your presence required anywhere now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The four of them looked amongst themselves and shook their heads.</p>\n<p>Draco tilted his head. \u201cThen come.\u201d</p>\n<p>He led them towards the dungeons. Behind one of the tapestries was Slytherin\u2019s insignia and he instructed one of them to place their wand tip at the corner, causing an entrance to open behind the tapestry. It would only stay open for as long as it took for the wand\u2019s owner to pass through. The first years did so in a quiet, orderly fashion, and it was minute later that Draco was ushering them up a narrow flight of stairs. The faintest smell of food lingered, and it became stronger as the light brightened.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Merlin</em>,\u201d one of them breathed.</p>\n<p>A house elf quickly came up to them. \u201cHow would Simp be able to help Mr. Malfoy and friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA space sufficient for us to move around freely and cast spells, if possible,\u201d Draco said after a moment of deliberation. The kitchens were not the most suitable place for this, but the Room of Hidden Things was too far from the dungeons, and using an abandoned classroom was too dangerous\u2014anyone could find them. And Draco was not welcome in the Slytherin dungeons.</p>\n<p>Simp nodded and led them towards an area away from the cooking. \u201cIf Mr. Malfoy be putting up wards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The house elf gave Draco an anguished look, whilst the Slytherins gave him one of surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Mr. Malfoy being sure he doesn\u2019t want food? Drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned to the Slytherins. \u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Their spokesperson shook her head hurriedly. \u201cNo\u2014no thank you,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>Simp gave them a sad look before bowing and heading back to the hubbub of other elves.</p>\n<p>As he promised, Draco walked in a circle to cast up the shield wards. They were weak, but if given warning and time, he would be able to lay down stronger wards.</p>\n<p>He raised a hand. \u201cThis space is sufficient. If it is suitable, we meet Friday nights when Potter\u2019s duelling club is running.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2014<em>wait!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco raised a bemused eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you teach us something <em>now</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. \u201cDo you know Harry Potter\u2019s signature spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the boys stuck his hand up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamien. It's the Disarming spell!\u201d he said excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect. The Disarming charm is taught in second year defence, but as you are all Slytherins,\u201d Draco swept his gaze across the children, \u201cI expect you all to learn quickly. Understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>They all nodded silently.</p>\n<p>Draco twirled his wand and the word <em>Expelliarmus</em> appeared in the air. \u201cLook at it. Commit it to memory. <em>Expelliarmus</em>\u2014Repeat, one at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>They didn't leave until all of them could cast it. But before they left, Draco warned them: \u201cIt's not enough to be able to cast successfully. You must never cast it <em>wrong</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia, and her closest friend Lela, led the chorus of nods. \u201cWe\u2019ll practice. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco felt something warm bloom in his chest, and it was a struggle to keep a calm face. \u201cDon't make me regret teaching you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little Slytherins all puffed out their chests. \u201cWe won't, Mr. Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco pulled down the wards. \u201cThen I expect to see you all here next Friday at 7 p.m. sharp.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry wriggled in the circle of Draco's arms. He shifted back a bit to see Draco\u2019s face. \u201cDraco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made an absent hum. \u201cGo to sleep, Potter,\u201d he mumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you in the kitchens, with\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned to Harry sharply. \u201c<em>Spying</em> on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry meet Draco\u2019s glare calmly. \u201cI was worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I can handle things myself,\u201d Draco snapped back. There must have been something on Harry\u2019s face, because he immediately softened and sighed. \u201cSome of the first year Slytherins wanted to talk to me\u2014and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. Hurry up and close your eyes and go to sleep. We have to be up early if you want to go for a fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took Harry a moment to process Draco\u2019s words. \u201cThat\u2019s...good, then?\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cThat they\u2019re talking to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to think so, Potter. Clearly, it helps that I can talk back and\u2014<em>go to sleep already and stop irritating me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...umm...\u201d Somewhere in Harry\u2019s mind, he thought to ask Draco about coming out, but Draco\u2019s hand was stroking his hair and the lullaby floated around his ears...and he fell asleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry woke up wrapped around Draco and something hard pressing against his stomach. His flush was immediate. He attempted to extricate himself, but he accidentally did something that make Draco moan in his sleep and pull Harry in tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco...\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes opened wide and he immediately let go of Harry. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry watched Draco shift away with a heavy stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to do <em>it</em> with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him an intense look. \u201cYou still think it\u2019s wrong for you to be with a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry folded his arms. \u201cNo, I don't.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still enter your dreams, Potter. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Harry swallowed. \u201cWhat have I been dreaming about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked just as uncomfortable. \u201cThere have been some dreams about Dumbledore, but also about your supposed Golden Boy requirement of having a girlfriend. And your Muggle relatives feature frequently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ran a frustrated hand through his hair. \u201cThey\u2019re not supposed to matter any more. I <em>know</em> it\u2019s okay\u2014I\u2019ve even <em>practiced</em> putting my finger up my\u2014can\u2019t we just\u2014you\u2019re not...hard any more, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Draco turned away from Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t try to force it, Potter. It\u2019ll make you feel worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo tell people that I\u2014you and me. About you and me,\u201d Harry repeated, more firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe papers are still talking about Dumbledore,\u201d Draco said lowly.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned and sat up. \u201cI thought you wanted it to be public.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly, I am simply arguing with you for argument\u2019s sake,\u201d Draco muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Well</em>,\u201d Harry said, leaning over Draco and forcing him to meet Harry\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019m asking you how you want to go about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes. \u201cAfter I inform my parents and friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? I told Hermione and Ron already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I was uncertain,\u201d Draco said quietly.</p>\n<p>It was best not to think about it, Harry thought, as he straddled Draco and forced their mouths to meet in one smooth move.</p>\n<p>He did his best, nibbling at Draco\u2019s bottom lip, slipping his tongue into Draco\u2019s mouth. He let his tongue trace Draco's lips, his teeth. He felt Draco reluctantly respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I\u2014\u201d Harry panted, once he withdrew from Draco, \u201c\u2014have to do this every single time you\u2019re <em>unsure</em> about something? <em>Tell me</em>,\u201d Harry added, when Draco remained silent. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, tell me what you\u2019re uncertain about. I\u2019m the fucking Gryffindor, remember? The Saviour? I\u2019m not going to try blackmail you, or sell your words or\u2014\u201d Harry gave a sigh. \u201cI thought we went through this already.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence stretched, and Harry thought he might have to grind down on Draco\u2019s groin to get <em>some</em> kind of reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be your first time, wouldn\u2019t it. You never looked as though you\u2019d shagged the sh\u2014the youngest Weasley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Harry admitted.</p>\n<p>Draco smirked weakly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my first time too. Not all the rumours about me are true.\u201d Draco\u2019s hand raised and it caressed Harry\u2019s cheek. Harry fought the urge to shiver at the touch.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, but that didn\u2019t stop the flush creeping up his neck. \u201cHermione gave me some books. To build up to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cMerlin, she did <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was embarrassing as heck,\u201d Harry replied petulantly. \u201cShe gave me both Muggle and Wizarding books. And then she talked to me about cleaning and protection and using lube and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed, looking gleeful. \u201cShe <em>gave you the talk</em>! What else did she say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> can ask her if you want to know so badly!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked mock-sorrowful. \u201cI would have loved to have seen the look on your face when Granger talked to you. Oh Merlin, your friends are <em>priceless</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry crawled off Draco and pulled him up. \u201cWrite those letters <em>now</em>, Draco. You can give them to Teithiwr when she arrives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco caught Harry\u2019s chin. \u201cYou...\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry went for a gentle smile. \u201cYes?\u201d He could see the questions, the insecurity lurking in Draco\u2019s eyes and expression, and he felt a little thrill that Draco was even <em>showing</em> these emotions to him.</p>\n<p>Draco straightened. \u201cI will write to them, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>A bubbling filled Harry\u2019s stomach about what was going to happen.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco eyed the watchers apprehensively. Only a few were there when he and Harry arrived at the Quidditch pitch; one of them ran off and the stands subsequently filled. And whilst some of the faces were not familiar and some were non-aggressive, he recognised some of them. And they knew that he had seen them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Harry had said, after a scowling glance at the spectators. \u201cWe could change the day and time, next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco had nodded back, and his misgivings had flown away soon after the Snitch was released and they were enmeshed in a race to catch it.</p>\n<p>But once they\u2019d landed and finished, Draco became acutely aware of them again. He felt a light touch on his arm and he turned his gaze back to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think the letters reached them yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents have most likely received theirs. However, Pansy, Blaise and Greg are on the Continent, if you recall. An owl cannot fly <em>that</em> fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry toyed with the edges of the Quidditch robe. \u201cLet\u2019s go back in, then.\u201d Harry looked up again. \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA day, perhaps two,\u201d Draco mused. He glanced at their watchers again and started heading back towards the castle. Harry followed him tamely.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggle phone calls would be faster,\u201d Harry said, once they were safely inside their room.</p>\n<p>Draco took off the flying guards. \u201cUseless for those who don\u2019t have those...Muggle things.\u201d When he met Harry\u2019s gaze again, he was taken aback\u2014even more so when Harry pounced on him. Draco grunted with surprise as he fell back onto the bed. He thought Harry would kiss him, but instead, Harry\u2019s fingers were a furious blur over his clothes, undoing buttons and pulling layers off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Harry pulled off Draco\u2019s flying robes successfully, \u201clooked so\u201d\u2014shirt unbuttoned\u2014\u201cfucking amazing.\u201d Harry seemed to give up on trying to take off everything and just slipped his hands under the remaining layer, teasing Draco's side. Draco shivered, for Harry\u2019s hands were cold, and his touch left paths of tingling in its wake.</p>\n<p>Harry looked at him with a heated gaze, face flushed, hair even more disheveled than usual. He looked utterly debauched <em>already</em>, and a wave of lust went through Draco. He was <em>allowed</em> to want to this, to want Harry. He was allowed to touch Harry, to hope for a future where someone would <em>like him</em>, and not see the Death Eater first.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco\u2014don\u2019t just <em>look</em> at me like that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco flipped Harry over with a growl and it became his turn to pull off Harry\u2019s clothes. Unlike Harry, he succeeded in rendering Harry half-naked. Harry\u2019s skin wasn\u2019t smooth\u2014dry at places, rough with coarse hair, old wounds and faded scars\u2014but that made him so much more interesting. Draco pulled out Harry\u2019s cock, and without hesitation, Harry reached out to Draco and took him in hand as well.</p>\n<p>Harry froze. Draco almost worried immediately, if it weren\u2019t for the look of embarrassment on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cProtection spells, Hermione said. Always.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded shortly and withdrew his wand from his discarded robe. With two swishes, the spells lay down on their skin, tingling a slight bit before seeping in. Harry let out a sigh, relaxing into the bed.</p>\n<p>Harry gave a little tug on Draco\u2019s cock. \u201cHow, um, do we do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave him an uncertain look, but removed his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Draco propped himself up with one arm by Harry\u2019s head and carefully lowered his hips until he could grasp both their cocks with one hand.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s pupils dilated. \u201cFeels good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded mutely. His grip was awkward and it took some concentration for him to stroke them both properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes slipped shut, and Draco moved his hand faster. The first rush of pleasure made Draco shiver.</p>\n<p>Harry rocked beneath him, arching up. His lips parted in a moan and the sound made Draco\u2019s heart flutter. He lowered his head and gave Harry a sloppy kiss. Harry's hands buried themselves in Draco's hair and manoeuvred his head so that they were <em>kissing</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco moaned as Harry tugged at his hair. He bit down on Harry's bottom lip, and Harry whimpered, setting Draco's lips abuzz. Harry's breath was <em>warm</em> and <em>intoxicating</em>, hot and wet and hinting of syrup, and it made Draco feel <em>so close</em> to him.</p>\n<p>Draco felt his muscles tensing as the heat rose and rose. He broke the kiss with a groan, eyes opening. \u201cIs it\u2014\u201d Draco panted.</p>\n<p>Harry tossed his head to the side. \u201cYeah\u2014just\u2014\u201d His eyes scrunched up. With a quiet gasp, Harry came, with the sweetest expression on his face.</p>\n<p>Mesmerised, Draco sped up, came with a shudder, and collapsed onto Harry in a boneless heap.</p>\n<p>Harry recovered first, sneaking a hand under Draco to retrieve Draco\u2019s wand. At the sharpness of cleaning spells, Draco rolled off him.</p>\n<p>Harry burrowed his head into Draco\u2019s side. \u201cSleepy.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Draco gave up on his plan to have a shower and closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After Sunday lunch, Harry went off to coach the Gryffindor team. It meant Draco could deal discreetly with the Hufflepuffs that came his way, and the subsequent group of Slytherins that came up to him\u2014ten this time, instead of four.</p>\n<p>Amelia Nguyen\u2014their spokesperson\u2014led the way. \u201cMr. Malfoy, we cannot wait until Friday,\u201d she said without preamble. \u201cWe\u2014we practised the spell you taught us, we <em>do</em> know it. But there will be classes tomorrow, and you simply can't cast it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco suppressed a sigh. \u201cThen we go to the kitchens. But understand this is Felicity Shafiq\u2019s responsibility as head\u2014she is, I presume?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe believes we should try <em>ourselves</em> and learn from books like <em>Ravenclaws</em>. It\u2019s so\u2014absolutely unfair!\u201d The Slytherins all nodded.</p>\n<p>Draco kept silent, ushering them towards a different, closer entrance to the kitchens.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey \u2018prank\u2019 us during class, using Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes stuff. How are <em>we</em> supposed to obtain those things? We\u2019re too young to be allowed to Hogsmeade, and Felicity won\u2019t budge.\u201d Amelia made a motion of despair. She turned to him, defiant. \u201cWe told Professor Slughorn, but he said that pranks are a harmless part of school life. <em>Harmless!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco curled his lip. Slughorn was a man of easy things, and a little bit too able to see only the things he wished to. They reached the portrait in front of the kitchens and Draco went up to tickle the pear. He could see their brains working as the portrait swung open\u2014what other portraits hid entrances to hidden rooms?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got caught when we tried to prank them back,\u201d Amelia told him without a blush on her face. \u201cSo you <em>have</em> to teach us how to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst focus on protecting yourself and your things before going on the offensive,\u201d Draco said mildly. \u201cIt won\u2019t do to attack and find that you\u2019ve been ambushed from behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was a little taken aback when one of them took out some Muggle items and started writing. Amelia, however, looked unperturbed as she herded them into the ring that marked the boundary of the wards Draco had raised the previous night. She turned to him, entirely business.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, sir, we only have time for one or two spells,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cSo, please teach us the next two most important spells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco groaned inwardly, already regretting his decision to actively help them. He had thought that it would raise his standing and, reduce his load if they could defend themselves. He also thought it would be...pleasant to have some sort of following.</p>\n<p>It was because he did not want to lose face that he did not back down. Though, as Draco surveyed the faces of the younger students, he had to admit to himself that their looks of admiration also provided incentive.</p>\n<p>Draco nodded slowly, withdrawing his wand to call up the wards.</p>\n<p>\u201cA deflection charm. If you are smart enough,\u201d\u2014Draco watched bemusedly as some of them stood straighter\u2014\u201cthen we can proceed to a shield charm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia looked amongst her peers and nodded decisively. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry watched Teithiwr swoop in and land in front of Draco. Draco took the letters from Teithiwr\u2019s claws and gave her an affectionate smile. She cooed back before leaving their company for the house elves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s and father\u2019s letters,\u201d Draco replied distractedly.</p>\n<p>Harry could only keep quiet only for a moment. \u201cAnd?\u201d When Draco didn\u2019t reply, he shuffled in and leant into Draco\u2019s space. Draco nudged him back.</p>\n<p>Harry tried to be patient, but... \u201c<em>Well</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned to him, with a grave expression on his face. \u201cHarry, you must understand...\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt his stomach drop.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents, to my relief, accept our relationship,\u201d Draco continued, in the same, serious tone.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. Then, he blinked again. Draco looked back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Harry lunged at Draco, catching him about his waist. \u201cBloody almost gave me a heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco spluttered as he collapsed partially onto the table, but almost immediately, Harry felt Draco's chest rumble as he started to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Merlin</em>, you should have seen your <em>face!</em>\u201d Draco said, between fits of laughter.</p>\n<p>Harry squeezed tighter, fully intent on squashing Draco\u2019s torso. \u201cWasn\u2019t funny,\u201d he scowled.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a pointed look. \u201cNo, it was quite funny.\u201d He shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou knew Mother liked you, didn\u2019t you? At Aunt Andromeda\u2019s house.\u201d Draco wriggled in Harry\u2019s arms, forcing him to weaken his grip. Not that Harry could maintain it, face almost squashed into Draco\u2019s side as it was.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell what your mum\u2019s thinking,\u201d Harry muttered back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Draco patted him on the head. \u201cTake my word for it then, Potter. She likes you. And if she likes you, there is no need to worry about Father. Well, a very tiny bit of worry is required.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned, only now remembering Lucius Malfoy. \u201cWell, if you say so,\u201d Harry said slowly.</p>\n<p>Draco hummed, and he was the one to break the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re a cuddler, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said, in an entirely too-curiously innocent voice.</p>\n<p>Harry grunted, but made no move to extricate himself from Draco. In the silence that had preceded Draco\u2019s words, Harry had been thinking how nice it felt to do this\u2014being close together without the need for words.</p>\n<p>Draco patted his head again. \u201cHarry Potter is very adorable,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cI believe that your animagus form will be something very small and cuddly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd yours would be a very annoying, very loud, squawking peacock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco actually shuddered. \u201cMerlin, <em>no</em>. You do not understand how much they like to <em>hurt</em> you, and they\u2019re absolutely territorial. I couldn\u2019t go into some of the gardens without Father, because they\u2019d attack anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Harry\u2019s turn to pat Draco on the head. \u201cAww, poor Dwaco,\u201d Harry crooned. \u201cDid the big bad peacock make you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>And it was Harry\u2019s turn to laugh at the abject expression of Draco\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Draco</em>,\u201d Harry said, not letting go of Draco\u2019s sleeve. He <em>wasn\u2019t</em> going to allow Draco make him face Slughorn alone. The way Draco was jerked back into Harry\u2019s arms was pretty funny and Harry sneaked Draco a hug.</p>\n<p>Draco straightened immediately and looked to the ceiling. \u201cYes, Harry?\u201d he said, with the most aggrieved voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d Harry whispered. He glanced down the corridor and, on cue, Slughorn appeared, rounding the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotions out to get you again?\u201d Draco asked.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded with utmost solemnity. \u201cYes, potions and Slughorn. Your presence and your help are necessary for my safety. As the Saviour of the Wizarding World, I require your personal assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made an inelegant snort, but he didn\u2019t leave Harry\u2019s side. However, he did flick Harry on the forehead. \u201cGot it, Scarhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, is it just me or do we <em>always</em> have Double Potions on Monday mornings?\u201d Harry muttered.</p>\n<p>Any reply Draco might have given was cut short as Slughorn approached Harry in big strides and clapped Harry on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, great work on your last assignment,\u201d Slughorn said, smiling widely.</p>\n<p>Harry peered up at Slughorn. \u201cThank you, Professor.\u201d He turned to Draco, whose face had smoothed to disinterest. \u201cThank you for helping me, Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco's eyes told Harry as clearly as if he spoke\u2014<em>What the fuck are you doing?</em> Harry looked back innocently.</p>\n<p>Draco made the tiniest eye roll back, but played along with Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned back at Slughorn, who was looking uncomfortably at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I\u2014good work on your assignment too, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d Slughorn said, flustered.</p>\n<p>Draco dipped his head slightly. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn cast Harry a strange look that clashed with the smile on his face. \u201cWell. Let us go in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded back pleasantly, waiting for Slughorn to open the door and enter first. He caught Draco\u2019s sleeve again before he could slip away.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Potter</em>,\u201d Draco hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you help me brew as well? I\u2019ll join you in the back row.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave a little shake of his head and glanced at Slughorn inside the room. \u201cWhy would you need to?\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis just is <em>not</em> done\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Indulge</em> me,\u201d Harry said, as low and deep as he could. He grinned inwardly at Draco\u2019s catch of breath and dilating pupils.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014fine. <em>Fine</em>.\u201d Draco turned his head from Harry with a tiny huff.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes but complacently followed Draco to the back row. He put his bag down on the table and sat down.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, <em>Harry</em>, you need to wash your hands before brewing,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Harry replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cContaminants, <em>Harry</em>.\u201d Draco looked prepared to drag him over to the sink.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned, and he looked at his hands thoughtfully. There <em>was</em> dirt stuck under his fingernails, and one of his fingers felt sticky with jam residue. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sighed. \u201cI see that you truly do need my help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Harry grinned brightly back.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The other students didn\u2019t notice him and Harry at first, when they came into the room. After all, Draco was normally by himself at the back\u2014what more was there to see? Slughorn kept darting glances at them, though Harry seemed oblivious. Draco wasn\u2019t, but he pretended to be, inspecting Harry\u2019s hands critically to make sure they were clean. Draco cast a cleaning charm regardless.</p>\n<p>When Weasley and Granger arrived, the pair gave them a curious look, and Granger made her way to the back, followed by a less-eager Weasley.</p>\n<p>The class started whispering then, the move drawing their eyes to the back. Draco felt like shaking his head. His friendship with Harry was mentioned in the Daily Prophet <em>every single day</em> for a number of weeks already and with the Golden Trio for days now. It was unusual for them to look at him with <em>envious</em> eyes, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, Draco,\u201d Granger greeted warmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Hermione,\u201d Harry replied. He was still smiling brightly.</p>\n<p>Granger looked at them curiously. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco offered to help me today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cPlease do not take Harry\u2019s word. I have been pressed-ganged into service.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was really surprised when Weasley burst out laughing. \u201cMalfoy, you\u2019re not too bad,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Draco gave a disdainful sniff.</p>\n<p>Harry patted him sympathetically on the arm. \u201cAww, you\u2019ve hurt poor Dwaco\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasley laughed even harder, and Granger cracked a grin.</p>\n<p>Draco glared at all them, especially Harry. \u201cClass is about to begin, so sit down and look to the front,\u201d he said, mustering every ounce of calmness he had.</p>\n<p>He had utterly brilliant timing, because at that moment, Slughorn loudly cleared his throat and started to greet the class. As expected, Granger immediately turned her attention to the front, and by example, Harry and Weasley followed.</p>\n<p>Draco smirked inwardly, smug that he had the last word.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After a brief introductory, Slughorn set them working on a potion used to aid patients with hypothermia.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco, aren't we supposed to get ingredients now?\u201d Harry asked, a little worried. Ron and Hermione were already lining up at the ingredients cupboard.</p>\n<p>Draco finished jotting down something in his journal first. \u201cI prefer to choose ingredients unhurriedly,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cYou're welcome to go first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI guess.\u201d <em>Draco avoids the crowd</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco stood up. \u201cSet up your cauldron. For this sort of potion, pure water is beneficial. Start boiling water and distilling it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn <em>aguamenti</em> isn't enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to remove as much trace of our own magic as possible. The distillation process does this,\u201d Draco replied, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou're conjuring water out of <em>nothing</em> after all\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cContaminants, right?\u201d Harry felt pleased.</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. \u201cLearning well, my pupil.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, should I call you 'Master Draco' now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco lifted his chin. \u201cWell, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled, and he followed Draco's movements. Draco appeared to be ignoring it, but Harry saw Slughorn nervously approaching them from the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, doing alright back here?\u201d Slughorn asked. \u201cYou haven't retrieved the necessary ingredients.\u201d His hands fluttered a bit by his side.</p>\n<p>Harry put on a smile, which Slughorn returned. \u201cYes. Draco was just telling me it's best to purify the water first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn's gaze flickered towards Draco. \u201cAh, yes, very good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once Slughorn walked away, Draco snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're Slughorn's little Gryffindor,\u201d Draco mocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways awkward as fuck,\u201d Harry said, sighing mightily. \u201cAnyway, you're my master now,\u201d Harry said cheekily. \u201cSo I'm <em>your</em> little Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have you spanked for that,\u201d Draco murmured, licking his lips.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cYou should be focusing on your potion, Master Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. \u201cA Harry Potter elixir isn't a bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I think Slughorn's looking at us again. How long do you think before he'll come over here again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco frowned. \u201cNever, I'd hope.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that's why my potions are so bad,\u201d Harry said contemplatively.</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. \u201cI'm sorry to tell you, Mr. Potter, but Potions is a sentient being out to get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut now I have the <em>amazing</em> Master Draco to guide me through the dense thicket!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Focus</em>, little Gryffindork. Reduce your flame.\u201d Despite the reprimand, Draco's eyes were alight with amusement.</p>\n<p>Harry made a good potion that lesson; but even better, Draco wasn't alone at the back of the room.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco headed to the Library after Arithmancy, intent on finding a specific book before dinner. Granger had gone in the opposite direction to the Eighth Year Dorms. Potions that morning had gone well, and Draco might have revelled, just a bit, in Slughorn\u2019s expressions when he was forced to acknowledge Draco in front of the beloved Golden Trio. At times, Slughorn had this wonderfully twisted expression, caught between forlornly looking at Harry and grimacing at Draco.</p>\n<p>The four of them had entered the Great Hall for lunch together, though Draco parted ways with them when he headed to the Slytherin table. There, Amelia and her band settled themselves around him in a blatant display of support and affiliation. It was the first time Draco did not leave lunch early.</p>\n<p>Draco felt good. People talked to him, wanted to be around him and listened to him. And it was that sense of fulfilment, Draco thought, was the reason why he did not notice <em>them</em> until it was too late. He was too immersed in recalling the day\u2019s events that by the time he noticed his detection wards pinging, his path was blocked by a gang of Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and Gryffindors. And when he realised that, he also realised that they had blocked the way behind him as well.</p>\n<p>A Gryffindor boy stepped out from the line. <em>Hooper, </em>Draco thought, feeling anger in his throat.</p>\n<p>Hooper raised his wand and pointed it directly at Draco\u2019s face. \u201cWhat are you doing to Harry Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco slipped his wand into his hand. Hooper was one of the people who had cursed Draco that second time.</p>\n<p>\u201cImperius? Potion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Draco said coolly.</p>\n<p>Hooper sneered. \u201cI see you have gained your voice back. Such a shame, really. If you understand what's <em>good</em> for you, you'll step away from Harry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made his expression colder. \u201cPerhaps it's you who doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstand <em>what?</em> You honestly believe that Harry Potter would willingly befriend a <em>Death Eater?</em> When <em>he</em> was the one who fought and killed Voldemort?\u201d Hooper glanced at the other students, who were nodding along with him. It made the fucking Gryffindor stand straighter and glare at Draco with a renewed self-righteousness even more sickening than Harry\u2019s, back when Draco had really loathed him.</p>\n<p>Draco counted. There were too many students. Standing in an almost-circle around him made them targets for each other\u2019s spells if they missed Draco, but it also meant Draco\u2019s back would only be protected by the pendant\u2014and the pendant could only hold a certain amount of power and spells.</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes. \u201cAnd if I tell <em>Harry</em> about <em>your</em> actions, <em>Geoffrey Leonard Hooper</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hooper laughed lowly. \u201cIf that's so, why haven\u2019t you told Harry Potter already?\u201d He looked amongst his group again and turned back to Draco with a cocky grin. And then he cast the first purple-red hex.</p>\n<p>Draco slipped easily into nonverbal counters. He sidestepped the first hex, deflected the second, deflected the third. His heart rate picked up, and he could feel the beginnings of sweat beading on his forehead. He gripped his wand tighter and chanced an <em>Expelliarmus</em> in-between a deflection charm and a shield charm. It almost succeeded, tugging away one wand, but Draco couldn\u2019t bloody maintain the disarming spell for just the <em>moment</em> longer it needed.</p>\n<p>The air became thick with red stunners, and it made Draco\u2019s stomach roll and the heart pump harder. He couldn\u2019t brazen it out, couldn\u2019t advance towards them, couldn\u2019t scare them off and walk away with his back turned. He felt his face put on a thunderous expression, no matter how calm and cool he wanted to appear. A tremor of fear went through him when he missed a spell and it careened into his pedant\u2019s defence. <em>Keep it together!</em> he snarled to himself. <em>Remember the Dark Lord? Remember Bellatrix? This should be child\u2019s play.</em></p>\n<p>Draco pushed out an intense deflection spell, out and <em>out</em> until it pushed back against fucking Hooper. Hooper stumbled, and for a brief moment, the onslaught eased. Then the spell shattered and Draco had to cast yet another shield.</p>\n<p>It was just a lapse, just <em>one fucking pause</em> in his spell casting when he thought it might be a tiny bit easier to cast aloud then force the spells nonverbally, that was enough for a stunner to hit him. It meshed angrily with the pendant\u2019s magic and his shields and made him freeze instead of knocking him unconscious. A small mercy, that, because it meant he was conscious as the hexes hit him. He didn\u2019t flinch at the pain\u2014he <em>couldn\u2019t</em>. Instead, he forced himself to concentrate on breaking the stunner; he could still feel his wand, and he swirled the words of counter spells around his mind and pushed magic through and outwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only place that deserves you is Azkaban!\u201d Hooper sneered. \u201c<em>This</em>, this is for every hurt and pain you and your fucking Death Eaters did to us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco ignored him and a burst of triumph accompanied the breaking of the spell. He had barely time to non-verbally cast a shield before a blast of lightning knocked him down and burnt his wand arm. He choked down a scream.</p>\n<p>Hooper stepped forward. \u201cYou could <em>never</em> feel the pain we have, short of a fucking agonising death. <em>Because that\u2019s what happened to my sister</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hooper was close enough that the others had stopped firing spells, and as his foot came closer to Draco\u2019s face, Draco gripped his wand tighter and rolled and rose in a movement that made pain flare anew in his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you feel fucking remorse, Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco curled his lip. <em>Of course </em>he did, but it\u2019d be fucking useless telling <em>them</em>.</p>\n<p>Hooper raised his wand and cast a spell at Draco point blank. Draco forced magic into a shield charm, raising his arm in an instinctive block.</p>\n<p>The movement was too sharp, and his arm burned with pain and his fingers jerked around his wand. The spell hit him and the feeling of ice spread from his chest, so <em>cold</em> it hurt. His heart missed a beat as he was frozen into place.</p>\n<p>Hooper curled his lip back. \u201cAre you feeling pain yet? Is guilt choking you yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco couldn\u2019t even move his <em>eyes</em> to see where the voice came from.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo! Away! <em>Expelliarmus!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a shout of anger and another chorus of Expelliarmus. <em>Amelia and her Slytherins</em>, Draco realised.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve done it <em>now!</em>\u201d yelled a voice too low to be one of the Slytherins.</p>\n<p>Hooper cast the ice spell at Draco again before he stepped past to look behind. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the little baby snakes,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>Draco imagined himself glaring at Hooper: even baby snakes were venomous. What he heard though, were shield charms and disarming spells against hexes. The Slytherins wouldn't last. They wouldn\u2019t be able to free him.</p>\n<p>Hooper made a snorting sound and turned back to Draco. \u201cNow, what to do with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s heart thumped in his chest and his stomach dropped. In a flurry of mental activity, he attempted nonverbal wandless counterspells.</p>\n<p>Hooper seemed to sense Draco\u2019s struggle; he smirked and raised his wand.</p>\n<p>Harry saw a crowding of students around the label of footprints of <em>Draco Malfoy</em> on the Marauders\u2019 Map. Horror and anger stirred simultaneously. He jumped out of the sofa, ignored Hermione\u2019s startled question, and dashed out of the Eighth Year common room.</p>\n<p>He saw them from behind, and as his feet thudded closer, he made out the flash of white-blond hair.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Draco!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He flung out his hand and fired an indiscriminate disarming spell.</p>\n<p>The students turned to him, their faces angry before sharply turning into a mixture of shock, fear and embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry Potter!\u201d The words rippled through the crowd of students and faces turned to him as they edged back towards the corridor walls.</p>\n<p>Harry snarled at them as he stalked forward. \u201cFuck you all! The War\u2019s fucking <em>over</em>!\u201d He wanted to wipe the sickening looks of embarrassment off their face: they should be chastised and feel <em>fucking sick</em> of their <em>fucking stupid</em> actions. Harry pointed his wand and the students had a fucking inch of intelligence to let him through.</p>\n<p>Harry stalked forward. Draco was blocked from his view by some Gryffindor and that was fucking <em>shit</em>. \u201cYou! Drop your wand.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Gryffindor turned and Harry\u2019s fist clenched when he recognised Geoffrey bloody Hooper.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey gave him a devious smile. \u201cHello, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry aimed his wand. \u201cWhat did you do to Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geoffrey\u2019s smile dropped. \u201cLook, Harry, it\u2019s nothing\u2014it\u2019s not permanent, like my <em>sister\u2019s death</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think people <em>I\u2019ve</em> loved have died?\u201d Harry stepped right into Geoffrey\u2019s space. \u201cYou were <em>there</em> when McGonagall talked to us at the start of the year, and you were fucking <em>there</em> when <em>I</em> talked to entire duelling club!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? You\u2019re <em>Harry Potter</em>. It\u2019s not the same!\u201d Geoffrey swung his head to Draco and back to Harry. \u201cYou don\u2019t <em>understand</em> what it\u2019s like to see his face every single day and to be reminded of the War and those fucking Death Eaters! Maybe <em>you</em> forgive him, but you\u2019re not the only person in the world, Harry Potter!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wanted to shout and scream and punch Geoffrey in the face <em>so fucking badly</em>. \u201cAnd <em>you</em> don\u2019t understand! What would you do if <em>your</em> family was held at wand point? Would you let your family die just so <em>you</em> could be on the good side?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geoffrey bared his teeth. \u201cAs though I\u2019m stupid enough to get into a situation like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point! It\u2019s not Draco\u2019s fault that his father was a Death Eater!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. <em>What</em>? Malfoy\u2019s a Death Eater too. He <em>chose</em> to bow down to You-Know-Who!\u201d Geoffrey snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore to the fucking point, the War is <em>over</em>! <em>I</em> don\u2019t see Draco attacking others. I see <em>you</em> attacking!\u201d Harry snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little\u2014\u201d a voice growled.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s head whipped to the side. He saw a first year Slytherin tussling with an older student.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go!\u201d the first year cried.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Expelliarmus</em>!\u201d The wand flew into Harry's left palm, and he dropped it to the ground. Harry heaved a breath and turned back to Geoffrey with narrowed eyes. \u201cNow, what did you do to Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geoffrey crossed his arms across his chest and turned his head away. \u201cThe spell should be wearing off now anyway. I\u2019m not <em>low</em> like some Death Eaters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shoved Geoffrey out of the way, turning immediately to Draco and placing a hand on his chest. The shifting of muscles rippled under his hand. Draco blinked. Harry\u2019s other hand raised tentatively to Draco\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispered. He ignored Geoffrey's indignant spluttering.</p>\n<p>Draco turned his head away and coughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nuzzled his hand even as he said, \u201cThe Slytherins\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re better off than you.\u201d Harry gingerly ran his fingers across Draco\u2019s arms and chest, and he caught Draco flinching.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em> has happened here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quailed, just a bit, at McGonagall\u2019s voice. Mostly though, he felt relief. <em>She can deal with this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were just\u2014\u201d Geoffrey started.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Attacking Mr. Malfoy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was shocked that it wasn\u2019t him to who spoke\u2014it was the group of little Slytherins.</p>\n<p>McGonagall stiffened and gave them a hard look. \u201cMr. Potter? Can you confirm this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked hopelessly at her, because didn\u2019t telling her still meant breaking his promise to Draco?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! Why won\u2019t you believe <em>us</em>?\u201d a voice called out.</p>\n<p>McGonagall turned her head slightly. \u201cMs. Nguyen, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this since the start of the year!\u201d The smallest of the Slytherins shook herself free. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair! <em>It\u2019s not fair!</em> What kind of Headmistress are you?!\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall looked a teensy bit taken aback, in Harry\u2019s judgment. Harry\u2019s respect for the Slytherin spiked. \u201cMs. Nguyen, if you\u2019d allow me to speak, I want <em>all of you</em> to see me in my office. I will speak with the Slytherins first, and I will expect to see <em>you</em>, Mr. Hooper, and your friends, an hour later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geoffrey visibly swallowed. \u201cYes, Headmistress. Erm...Headmistress?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mr. Hooper?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall nodded shortly. \u201c<em>After</em> dinner then. Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, I\u2019ll see you both tomorrow morning before breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and took Draco\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>McGonagall led the Slytherins away and the other students quickly dispersed, but not before Geoffrey gave them both a narrowed-eyed look.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It was after few minutes that Draco broke the silence between them. Harry knew that Draco\u2019s apparent acquiescence would not last.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you taking me,\u201d he said flatly.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. His fingers probed over Draco\u2019s arm, and on cue, Draco winced. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing compared to the Dark Lord,\u201d Draco replied in a false, flippant tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s,\u201d Harry said, ignoring Draco. He took his hand and made towards the first floor.</p>\n<p>Draco tugged his hand free. \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned and growled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, you stubborn prick!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can heal myself,\u201d Draco retorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, are you a qualified Healer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t throwing Dark curses, Potter. I have sufficient knowledge to heal myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grabbed him by both hands. \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t get your mistrust of Pomfrey\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Incorrect</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to see her, then at least let <em>me</em> help you.\u201d Harry looked as earnestly as he could at Draco, and he was relieved when Draco\u2019s mouth softened. Harry kissed Draco lightly on his cheek. \u201cThanks. I was worried, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes flickered away before settling on Harry again. \u201cI should thank <em>you</em>. If you hadn\u2019t come...\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Then you would have gotten really badly hurt</em>, Harry silently filled in. He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I just did what was right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked weakly. \u201cI see. Ever the Saviour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry changed directions and took them back to the eighth year dorms.</p>\n<p>Hermione rose immediately from her seat when they entered. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cLater, please.\u201d He was aware of Draco's stiff posture and blank face, and he was aware of the curious glances some of the other students were giving them both. He was relieved when Hermione gave a slight nod and sat down again.</p>\n<p>In their dorm room, Draco turned his back to Harry and started taking off his robes. Harry placed a light hand on Draco's hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me help, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never agreed.\u201d But Draco let Harry slip his arms out the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Harry tossed the robes over Draco's chair. \u201cI know you hurt your arm,\u201d he said, as he undid the buttons on Draco's shirt, \u201cbut did you get hit anywhere else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco winced as the shirt was pulled away, but Harry could only give him an apologetic look. \u201cMy chest. I may have bruised my shoulder,\u201d Draco admitted.</p>\n<p>That drew Harry's attention to Draco's chest. Goosebumps were spreading across Draco's skin, and he could make out a star-burst of muted red-blue. Harry's heart beat a little faster when he saw the faded slashes across Draco's chest. He traced the ridge of one scar as it went from Draco's hip right through one of his nipples.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes...does it hurt anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco replied, equally quiet. \u201cThe scars, they don't have any feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry's eyes flickered uncertainly to Draco's. \u201cI never apologised to you about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco's eyes were hooded. \u201cI thought that it was justified, given all that I did before then\u2014and after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry couldn't help his hands, touching and probing Draco's skin. \u201cNo, it was just\u2014just something thoughtless and reckless. I wanted something that I knew you couldn't stop, but I didn't even know what it <em>was</em>.\u201d Harry looked up at Draco properly. \u201cI was so scared that I'd killed you. If Snape hadn't arrived...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I suppose you'd rather face my <em>Crucio</em> than kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can survive that,\u201d Harry said blithely. \u201cThe fact is, I'm sorry.\u201d Harry grasped Draco's hips and pressed the lightest kiss over the centre of Draco's chest. Draco trembled under his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHush, just let me heal you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the things\u2014I regret\u2014\u201d Draco stopped talking when Harry placed his wand on Draco's chest.</p>\n<p>Harry murmured some healing charms and watched critically as the colour faded.</p>\n<p>Draco huffed. \u201cThere's a lot of things we need to talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a lot of time ahead of us,\u201d Harry replied casually. He studied the burn on Draco's arm with an academic ferocity.</p>\n<p>A kiss dropped on Harry's head. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The unspoken promise spread a warm feeling through Harry.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen will you tell us what\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d Hermione pestered as they walked towards the Great Hall for dinner, and as they sat down at the Gryffindor table, and after she caught him looking at Draco across the Hall.</p>\n<p>Harry cursed inwardly. He <em>knew</em> he\u2019d forgotten to talk to Draco about something\u2014about how much Draco would let him say. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to tell you yet. But I think everything'll become clear soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him an unamused look. \u201cIt has something to do with Draco, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harry admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm...\u201d Hermione did not look placated, but at least she stopped questioning Harry in-between bites.</p>\n<p>Harry looked down the Gryffindor table. Geoffrey and his friends were seated far away from them, and he caught Harry\u2019s look with a narrowed gaze. He turned to his friends to whisper something, and those friends in turn gave Harry surreptitious glances. They in turn whispered to their neighbours and Harry got to watch the Hogwarts gossip mill at work.</p>\n<p>And of course this new rumour was about him, as he started receiving more and more of those odd looks. But the oddest thing was that they were looking at <em>Draco</em> as well.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes inwardly. If <em>he</em> wanted to look at someone, he would either look intently or discreetly, not that nauseating back-forth-back-forth looks some of the students were giving him across the Hall.</p>\n<p>Amelia\u2019s second in command, Lela, whispered something to her, and they both turned to Draco with wide-eyed looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it true that you\u2019re...friends with Harry Potter?\u201d Amelia asked.</p>\n<p>Draco turned his gaze to the person in question. \u201cThat rumour isn\u2019t entirely untrue,\u201d Draco replied. Harry met his eyes across the Hall, and when Draco nodded, Harry gave a little wave back.</p>\n<p>Amelia, however, still looked suspicious. \u201cWell, we just heard that you and Harry Potter...are...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Draco prompted with a suppressed sigh.</p>\n<p>Amelia quickly raised her hands. \u201cI\u2019m just the bearer of the news, yeah? That you and Harry Potter are <em>together</em>. Like, in a <em>like-</em>like way.\u201d Amelia\u2019s face twisted into distaste at the \u2018like-like\u2019.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes widened, and he quickly looked back to Harry. Harry looked lively and unconcerned as he chattered with Weasley and Granger.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Draco asked quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard from Lela, who heard from Malcolm, who\u2014\u201d Amelia cut herself off at Draco\u2019s look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s true after all,\u201d Draco said nonchalantly. He picked up his cup to take a sip. Draco kept his smirk to himself when Amelia\u2019s and Lela\u2019s eyes widened, shock written clearly on their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow\u2014\u201d Amelia breathed, before hastily adding, \u201cand <em>eww</em>. Adult <em>stuff</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lela looked at Draco hesitantly. \u201cDo you do...kissing things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Draco stood up.</p>\n<p>Lela whispered furiously to Amelia, and then turned to Malcolm and whispered furiously to him and...Draco could imagine the information spreading back up the chain. Pansy would have reveled in this.</p>\n<p>Draco made his way over to the Gryffindor table. Granger gave him a searching look, but obligingly made space for him next to Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. \u201cDraco!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked down the Gryffindor table pointedly, \u201cI think someone\u2019s been busy talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout me?\u201d Harry replied drily.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout this.\u201d Draco drew Harry towards him possessively and kissed him.</p>\n<p>Harry emerged from it red cheeked and blinking. \u201cWhat?\u201d Across the table, Weasley was making choking sounds and Longbottom was literally choking.</p>\n<p>Harry whispered, \u201cBut what about Parkinson and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey would have received my letters by now,\u201d Draco said softly into Harry\u2019s ear. <em>Obviously it would take twice as long for them to reply back</em>. He felt the eyes of the students on them, and Hooper was staring at him rather murderously. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Draco stood up in one smooth movement and walked back calmly to the Slytherin table.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry watched Draco walk away, half dazed. Did Draco just...? Did he...? But it...?</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was both unexpectedly, yet expectedly, showy of him,\u201d Hermione murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Neville finally choked out, \u201chow long have you been seeing Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry run a hand through his hair. \u201cNot that long, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErr, well, you don\u2019t need me to warn you, but the <em>Prophet</em>\u2019s gonna go mad over this,\u201d Neville said.</p>\n<p>Harry winced. Fuck, that was kind of why Harry wanted to keep it a secret.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just ignore them then, won\u2019t we, Harry?\u201d Hermione said sternly.</p>\n<p>Harry straightened and nodded. \u201cRight. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter?\u201d A student touched him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne Galleon per autograph,\u201d Ron said quickly.</p>\n<p>The Ravenclaw boy shook his head and looked ready to back away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes...?\u201d Harry prompted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHal.\u201d Hal gave Harry a wild look. \u201cI just wanted to say...you\u2019re-my-role-model-and...I\u2019m-gay-and-it-means-a-lot-to-me-that-you\u2019re-out...!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. One part of him recoiled from the idea of being anyone\u2019s role model; but another felt the need to rise up. It was like Hermione said, if the <em>Daily Prophet</em> thought being gay\u2014or <em>bisexual</em>, Harry reminded himself\u2014was bad, then all the more reason to punch the Prophet in the face by being out.</p>\n<p>Hermione nudged him under the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, no problem,\u201d Harry said. \u201cEr...good luck with your school work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal beamed. \u201cThank you, Mr. Potter!\u201d The Ravenclaw hurried back to his own table, looking bright.</p>\n<p>Hermione had a beaming smile. \u201cGood job, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco shifted as Harry climbed into bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat will you say tomorrow when you meet with McGonagall?\u201d Harry asked, without preamble.</p>\n<p>Draco suddenly felt very weary. \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry placed a hand over his mouth. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m weak?\u201d he asked, gazing earnestly at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said into Harry\u2019s palm. Harry was one of the <em>strongest</em> people he knew; also one of the most annoying, though.</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a skeptical look. \u201cSo you don\u2019t think I\u2019m weak, even though I have all those nightmares? Even though I\u2014\u201d a blush appeared on his cheeks, but he continued, \u201c\u2014need you to hold me at night and sing a lullaby so I don\u2019t get nightmares?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shifted Harry\u2019s hand away. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. Amelia and her Slytherins will tell McGonagall what she should know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hand twisted and he clamped down on Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cNo, what Hooper and the others were doing to you was <em>different</em>. Don\u2019t you want justice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome would say justice corresponds to sending my entire family to Azkaban for life,\u201d Draco said bluntly.</p>\n<p>Harry scowled. \u201cStop trying to change the subject. If it was before everything that happened, you would have thought I was weak and pathetic, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Harry put his hand back over Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t talk. <em>Think </em>about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco closed his eyes. He <em>would </em>have thought it was weak and pathetic, more so because it was <em>Potter</em>.</p>\n<p>Even if he ignored it, his subconscious had told him that those were attacks. Despite his want to keep calm and not let it affect him, it <em>did</em>: he changed his sleeping schedule, ate breakfast in the kitchens and was unable to communicate\u2014unable to <em>speak</em>\u2014with others in any meaningful way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s weak to need help, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry asked quietly.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes snapped open, but his protest died in his throat. He met Harry\u2019s eyes blankly. He didn\u2019t want to be powerless\u2014he had promised that to himself when Harry testified for him at the trials. He didn\u2019t want to need help, not when he had wanted it so much, in some indescribable way, during the war\u2014yet when it came too late, or at a cost almost as terrible...</p>\n<p>But Harry...</p>\n<p>Harry lifted his hand from Draco\u2019s mouth and rolled away to the edge of the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep your promise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I like it. Or...\u201d Harry turned back and faced Draco, with a determined look in his eye. \u201cHow about I remove your kissing privileges? And sex, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>wouldn\u2019t</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>would</em>,\u201d Harry said firmly, and fucking Merlin, Draco believed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is completely unrelated to the subject,\u201d Draco protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? You don\u2019t like it? Well, I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco found it hard to believe that Harry would coerce him in this way; it undermined the whole...Gryffindoriness and sincerity that was supposed to underlie confessions.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Harry warned. \u201cYou\u2019ve <em>got</em> to tell her. You don\u2019t fucking understand, the <em>need</em> is...\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sank back into the bed. \u201cMy confession would hardly alter McGonagall\u2019s response.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up and prodded Draco in the chest. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do it for yourself, or for justice, or for sex, can\u2019t you do it for <em>me</em>? You\u2019re the one who kissed me in front of the whole bloody school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco folded his arms. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Malfoy!</em> Stop being so fucking stubborn!\u201d Harry growled. \u201cWhat are you so fucking <em>scared</em> of? Because that\u2019s what it is\u2014you\u2019re just fucking scared of telling McGonagall the truth. Oh, you\u2019re not scared of being gay and kissing me in front of everyone, but the moment some kids younger than you start ganging up on you, you hide away!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bloody scared, <em>Potter</em>!\u201d Draco snapped. \u201c<em>You </em>don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em> I understand! <em>You</em> were a bloody pain in my side for six bleeding years!\u201d Harry\u2019s hand slammed into Draco\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Draco bucked and pushed Harry off. \u201cYou were my arch-rival, and that\u2019s worlds different from what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Draco hissed, pressing Harry into the mattress.</p>\n<p>Harry glared at him. With a scowl, he turned his head away. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been in my dreams, whether I like it or not,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201c<em>You</em>, out of anyone else, should know how shite my...\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed. \u201cYour childhood,\u201d he filled in, equally quiet. It was hard to remember that Harry had been attacked frequently in his childhood; Draco still struggled to see how <em>Harry Potter</em> could have been that kind of person, the kind of person that was bullied.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you understand <em>anything</em> I\u2019m trying to tell you?\u201d Harry ground out, when Draco stayed silent. He mustered some force to half slide Draco off him.</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t meet his gaze. \u201cNo, I admittedly don\u2019t...But I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco the most skeptical look he could make. \u201c<em>Really</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I may need you to remind me tomorrow morning,\u201d Draco added. \u201cAnything to make you stop complaining.\u201d Draco started stroking Harry\u2019s hair, and against his will, his eyes began to droop.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d Harry sighed and tilted his head towards Draco, moving his head more firmly onto Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s about time we figure out how you\u2019ve been entering my dreams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother has suspicions about Legilimency\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quirked a smile. \u201cCould be because I used your wand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco mussed Harry\u2019s hair. \u201cIndeed. Are you quite sure it\u2019s not past your bedtime?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, though admittedly his eyes had closed, and he was definitely not bothered to open them again. \u201cLegilimency, shared wand, and the fact that you keep your wand under your pillow,\u201d Harry counted off.</p>\n<p>Draco extricated Harry\u2019s glasses before he spoke. \u201cSounds surprisingly plausible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hummed. \u201cI am quite smart, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he said lightly, laughing when Draco\u2019s fingers attacked his sides.</p>\n<p>Finally, when had Harry gave Draco as good as he got and both of them were all laughed out, Draco swished his wand, tucking them both into bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut your wand on the bedside table,\u201d Harry directed.</p>\n<p>Draco did as Harry told, but he gave Harry a dubious look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're here. I don't need you in my dreams as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAssuming that the wand is the crucial link.\u201d Draco's fingers crept into Harry's hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm right, I'm sure of it,\u201d Harry said, even as he snuggled up closer to Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cGolden Boy gut feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d better get used to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco said nothing more, but Harry could feel Draco rolling his eyes. Instead, Draco dutifully sung Harry a lullaby about blue skies and fluffy white clouds.</p>\n<p>When Harry woke up, Draco's hand was once again tangled in his hair. Draco's eyes were open, and he had a contemplative expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dreamt of you,\u201d Harry said, stretching his arms.</p>\n<p>Draco turned to him and smirked. \u201cDid you? I'm flattered. After all, I didn't dream of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it <em>was</em> your wand.\u201d Harry grinned. \u201cI was right! I told you so!\u201d He jabbed Draco in the stomach, and quickly rolled off the bed before Draco could retaliate.</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. He waved a lazy hand at Harry. \u201cI had to let you be right sometimes. If <em>I</em> was right all the time, I'd be too perfect to live with.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>Harry groaned.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, take a seat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry touched Draco briefly before they sat on the two adjacent chairs. The portraits were awake and watching them curiously...and there was Dumbledore, with the twinkle in his eye, and Snape was half-turned away from them. Harry swallowed, his memories threatening to overwhelm him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have spoken with the others students,\u201d McGonagall started, much to Harry\u2019s relief. \u201cYou may want to know that they were either unharmed or had minor injuries that were healed. Madame Pomfrey did not keep anyone overnight.\u201d She gave them a piercing look. \u201cI neglected to see if either of you had injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was injured,\u201d Draco said quietly. \u201cHarry healed me, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Harry added.</p>\n<p>McGonagall pursed her lips. \u201cI see. Then, Mr. Malfoy, what occurred before the fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. I was only walking towards the Library when they surrounded me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you confirm this, Mr. Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not see the start of this attack, but I trust Draco.\u201d Harry turned to Draco and gave him a quick smile. Draco nodded back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had suspected that there was more,\u201d McGonagall sighed sadly. \u201cMr. Malfoy, I\u2019ll understand if you do not wish to tell me about what has been happening between the other students and yourself, and I <em>will</em> be taking measures regardless, but at the moment, you may be the best person to reveal the extent of these attacks. If nothing else, I would like to hear <em>your</em> side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was planning to,\u201d Draco said, giving Harry a weak smile. Harry gave him an encouraging smile back.</p>\n<p>Professor McGonagall nodded solemnly. \u201cThen, inform me.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco told her of the attacks against the innocent Slytherins, the pranks against them, though he left Slughorn\u2019s inaction out\u2014if McGonagall decided talked to Slughorn, then Draco was content to let him dig his own hole and fall in; it was possible that Amelia had already spoken about Slughorn\u2019s uselessness. He forced down his own pride and put his emotions away and told her about the attacks towards him, and the time he spent mute because of the curse.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they say anything to you?\u201d McGonagall asked, with a mixture of curiosity and self-righteous fury of the Gryffindor kind.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes flickered to the watching portraits of Dumbledore, who\u2019d watched the proceedings with damned-twinkling eyes, and to Severus, who had turned to face Draco when he had started speaking. He was looking at Severus when he said flatly, \u201cI\u2019m a Death Eater. I don\u2019t deserve to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019 eyes flashed.</p>\n<p>Beside him, Harry made a coughing sound. \u201c<em>Ex</em>-Death Eater. And <em>I</em> think you deserve to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco touched Harry lightly, and Harry gave him a stubborn look back. \u201cI mean it,\u201d Harry whispered loudly.</p>\n<p>The Headmistress stood up. \u201cThank you, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter. Rest assured that those students will be <em>severely</em> punished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rose to his feet, inclining his head.</p>\n<p>McGonagall gave Draco a determined look. \"I have failed in this, and I expect no forgiveness. But I can assure you that the Board of Governors will not remove Slytherin House from Hogwarts, not while I remain Headmistress.\"</p>\n<p>Draco looked up at her in shock. <em>The Board wanted to what?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said. He half-herded Draco out of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d Harry said lightly once the door had closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a blank look. \u201cI am <em>not</em> going to answer that question. We are returning to the kitchens.\u201d He turned sharply and picked up his pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose. But I think...\u201d Harry trailed off behind him, replaced by the sound of half-running footsteps as Harry caught up with him.</p>\n<p>Amelia and her Slytherins were in the next corridor, and Amelia, at least, looked faintly annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy, <em>all</em> she said she'll do was take points off and give them detention!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco glanced at Harry before addressing Amelia. \u201cWhat else could McGonagall do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPublic humiliation,\u201d was Amelia\u2019s sharp answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s even 'til they\u2019re <em>all</em> poked fun at.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Harry said, sounding horrified.</p>\n<p>Amelia\u2019s face immediately fell.</p>\n<p>Harry waved his hands and quickly said, \u201cNo, I mean, no, it\u2019ll make hate\u2014them\u2014make them hate you more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. \u201cAmelia,\u201d he said, drawing her attention away from the poor, inarticulate wizard. \u201cPublic humiliation wouldn't work. The public will not side with Slytherin House.\u201d And he did not even want to imagine the outrage from the school Board.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do it because that\u2019s bullying, <em>too</em>,\u201d Harry cut in.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Regard</em>less of reason, public airing won\u2019t work,\u201d Draco said. \u201cHowever, can you imagine those other students being able to keep quiet on how they suddenly have detentions and why their house points have coincidentally gone down sharply?\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia puffed up a cheek. \u201cI think I get it. Headmistress McGonagall is a Gryffindor, so they'd like her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry poked Draco. \u201cWe <em>have</em> to go the Great Hall now. I want to see those house points, or lack thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to see them now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming down for breakfast?\u201d Amelia asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe've already eaten. Go ahead.\u201d Draco made a small ushering notion.</p>\n<p>\u201cKay.\u201d Amelia and her Slytherins scampered off in a messy clump.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go see the hourglasses?\u201d Harry asked in a mournful voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see them at lunch,\u201d Draco replied dismissively. He made towards the kitchens, but Harry blocked his way.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Harry pressed. \u201cYou never go to breakfast in the Great Hall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a dark look, and Harry matched it. He knew full well why Draco didn\u2019t breakfast in the Great Hall\u2014the same reasons why Draco used to sit alone at one end of the table and left early during the meals he did attend. Because Harry knew the feeling of having no-one, the dichotomy between being attacked or entirely ignored. But that didn\u2019t mean he'd liked it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Harry tried, shrugging his shoulders in attempted nonchalance. \u201cYou are the great Draco Malfoy, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSod off,\u201d Draco muttered, but Harry could see the tiniest upwards twitch at the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you're not scared?\u201d he goaded.</p>\n<p>Draco crossed his arms. \u201cI'm not,\u201d he denied.</p>\n<p>Harry lifted his eyebrows and squarely met Draco's gaze. \u201cThen what's wrong with going down to the Hall?\"</p>\n<p>Harry felt he was drowning in Draco's eyes as they stared at each other. His eyelid was just starting to twitch when Draco broke the silence with the huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cGit,\u201d he muttered fondly. \"Then lead on, Mr. Saviour.\"</p>\n<p>Harry smirked in victory. He laced his fingers with Draco's and proceeded to drag him off to see the hourglasses.</p>\n<p>They made quick time, with Harry blatantly ignoring any of Draco's protests. As they approached the Entrance Hall, the noise rose sharply. Students milled around the four hourglasses, staring at them and speaking furtively amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>Harry looked at the hourglasses, filled with a large dose of respect for McGonagall. She had taken off <em>a lot</em> of points from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. He frowned as he focused on the chatter; <em>Slytherin</em> and <em>snakes</em> came up with a decidedly hateful undertone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll staff and students are to congregate in the Great Hall.\u201d McGonagall's voice rose above the noise.</p>\n<p>Harry grabbed Draco's arm, pulling him close before he could escape.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said we should go in,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were never one to follow rules,\u201d Draco said lightly, but he was betrayed by how tense his arm was in Harry's grip.</p>\n<p>\"We're already here. You're not going to back out the last minute, are you?\"</p>\n<p>Draco straightened his robes. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>They entered the Hall, Harry's hand firmly laced in Draco's. Harry ignored the other students' reactions, instead waiting until Draco realised that Harry wasn't going to let go.</p>\n<p>Draco leaned in Harry, speaking breathily into his ear, \u201cHm, do you wish to sit on my lap this breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shivered despite himself, and his cheeks heated up. \u201cCan't I sit next to my boyfriend?\u201d Harry protested.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a quick, sweet smile. \u201cBoyfriends, are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded firmly and finally looked away from Draco. He caught Amelia at the Slytherin table making gagging faces. She immediately winced, but Harry grinned back. He and Draco made their way over to her, and she shuffled her Slytherins down to make space for them.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill hungering for their public humiliation?\u201d Draco murmured as he sat down. He shot Harry an exasperated look when Harry refused to let go. Harry just did an awkward shuffle over the bench and sat down with a heavy plonk next to Amelia.</p>\n<p>Amelia and Lela gave them both large grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see the points?\u201d Amelia said excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr rather, not see the points?\u201d Lela followed quickly, before bursting into laughter.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded, grinning. \u201cWhen McGonagall does something, she does it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amelia shook her head. \"It's so weird. Like, I can't believe she <em>did</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes me hungry,\u201d Lela said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's breakfast,\u201d Amelia said dryly. \"Mr. Potter, can you pass the honey?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you call me Harry,\u201d Harry joked.</p>\n<p>Their eyes widened, and they said together, \u201cWow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled and reached over for the pot of honey.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Draco left Harry to amusing the Slytherins. The Hall was quickly filling as the students that had dawdled outside came in. The staff were already all there, aside from McGonagall; they looked calm enough eating their breakfast that Draco suspected they knew what was going to happen, which meant McGonagall had planned this before she even spoke to him and Harry.</p>\n<p>Slytherin House had all sat down. Felicity sat further down, and Draco caught her glancing at them. She pressed her lips together and, surprisingly, nodded at Draco. Draco returned her acknowledgment. The older years were more apprehensive, whispering furtively and looking uneasy. They were whispering about Draco's relationship with Harry, and their little conspiracy theories about how it connected with the missing House points.</p>\n<p>Some of the students from the other tables were blatantly staring at Harry. Hooper had an especially murderous look on his face, and the students around him didn't look particularly happy either.</p>\n<p>Draco's ears pricked at the sound of <span>wing-beats.</span> Teithiwr descended like an avenging angel, with sweeping gusts and a dark silhouette against the bright Hall ceiling. Draco twitched his wand to push the food dishes away from him just before the eagle owl landed.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeithiwr,\u201d Draco greeted. \u201cApologies, you'll have to go to the kitchens for your raw meat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Teithiwr gave Draco a patronising look, but let Draco take the newspapers and letters. The owl nipped Draco's fingers just as he finished and swooped up into the air. Draco watched, amused, as she flew, showing off to impressionable young Slytherins.</p>\n<p>Draco ignored the papers (<em>DEATH EATER DRACO MALFOY IN HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BOY WHO LIVED!)</em> and used his wand to open Pansy and Blaise's letter.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Draco,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have to declare that I, Pansy, knew it! He was looking at you all Hallowe'en. You'll invite him to the Manor for Christmas, won't you? Ohh, it's going to be fun! We should be expecting your face on the papers soon then. I hope it'll stop my heart from missing you just a bit. And yes, Blaise is being so stupid again <strong>as if. Hi Draco. I see you got your guy. Harry's quite cute, isn't he? I wonder if you will talk about Harry Potter more or less, now?</strong> See, Blaise can't even wait his turn. As I was saying, Blaise was skipping out on class to laze in the sun because he thought it'll lure in the students and of course he had to get in trouble and...\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco smiled and folded the letter up. He approached Greg's letter with a bit more apprehension, unsure of the distance between them now. Greg's standard photos tipped out, mostly of empty fields of sheep and the occasional dragon eating a sheep; there was a photo of Greg waving in front of a barn, with a pitchfork in his hand. A slip of paper came out.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hi Draco,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Whatever makes you happy. It's your life. I'll see you at Christmas.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Greg.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>P.S. Send me a photo of how you've been. (Please.)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Draco felt a swell of loyalty from Greg's letter. He'd have to ask Harry later if he knew anyone with a camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood news?\u201d Harry said, right into his ear.</p>\n<p>Draco squeezed Harry's hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that the\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco pushed the newspapers away from Harry. \u201cIgnore them,\u201d he said, a bit too sharply.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned and attempted to grab them. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned his head and kissed Harry's cheek. \u201cDo you trust the Daily Prophet or me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blushed, but that might have been because Draco had discreetly licked his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, I suppose,\u201d Harry said slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cStudents, to your seats, please.\u201d McGonagall swept in, bringing quiet with her. She turned and gave the Slytherin table a nod. By the time she ascended to the podium, the Hall was silent, aside from the clinking of utensils.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, staff and students. No doubt some of you have wondered where the House points have gone.\" She paused to gaze across the Hall. \"Well, it is <em>not</em> a mistake. A number of students from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw have committed what can be called <em>crimes</em> upon the Slytherin body. Points have been taken in light of that, and those students will be serving detention until the Christmas break.\"</p>\n<p>Whispers swelled; McGonagall called for silence immediately.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Never</em>, never in Hogwarts' history do we allow bullying between students, not least attacks on Slytherin students! I want everyone who has done so, and any student who <em>knew</em> of these attacks but did nothing, to be ashamed of themselves.\" McGonagall grabbed the edges of the podium, eyes shining with emotion. \"We've made it through the War. We're <em>alive</em>. What caused the war was disunity between us. So now, we have to unite. I'm not asking you to forgive those who have hurt and maimed and killed during the war. What I'm asking you is to not condemn Slytherins who've done nothing of the sort! What I'm asking you is to see people as they are now, and not clouded with your preconceptions.\" The Headmistress dropped her grip from the podium. \"The different Houses are meant to inspire healthy rivalry, not hatred. Don't repeat the mistakes of the past\u2014\"</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry leaned on Draco's shoulder as he listened to McGonagall talk. He could see that her words didn't reach all the students; he could see outright rejection on some of their faces. What kept him optimistic was that some students were listening carefully, and some were nodding to her words; he saw that there were some guilty looks at the Slytherin table mixed with the dark looks.</p>\n<p>He met Ron's gaze across the Hall, and Ron nodded firmly. <em>Of course</em>, Ron and Hermione would be committed to the reconciliation. Harry realised that he could count on Neville's support, and Ginny's and Luna's and...likely everyone from the old D.A., excluding Smith.</p>\n<p>There was more to do. Some of the hatred in the school reflecting the wider dislike in society, as Harry could clearly see in the top-half front page of the<em> Daily Prophet</em>, even though Draco had tried to hide it from him. But he wasn't alone in this battle.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled up at Draco, who was watching McGonagall. Draco tilted his head down and pressed an absent-minded kiss on Harry's forehead.</p>\n<p>Harry squeezed Draco's hand. They'd both come a long way since the start of the school year; and with a bit of luck and hell-load of stubbornness, they'd have a long time yet together.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>A few years later...</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone! Get in!\u201d Harry yelled.</p>\n<p>Draco trailed after Harry, watching amusedly as Harry hustled Greg Goyle and Charlie Weasley towards the group clustered in front of the Manor's Christmas tree. Xenophilius Lovegood, acting as the Quibbler's photographer, was tinkering with his camera atop a floating platform, with a Dean Thomas looking over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Draco</em>, what are you doing?\u201d Harry had such a harried expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, there's no <em>rush</em> to get this done,\u201d Draco drawled.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cI thought you really <em>really</em> wanted to open your presents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked. \u201cWatching you is infinitely more fascinating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cCome on, just get your parents in. I want them to stand next to Molly and Arthur and Andromeda.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco tugged Harry in and kissed his forehead. His heart warmed as Harry once again squeezed his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Now, off to do Harry\u2019s biding</em>,\u201d Harry drawled.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019ll make me listen?\u201d Draco replied drily, exaggerating his own drawl.</p>\n<p>Harry pushed Draco away. \u201cYou bet,\u201d he said, grinning. He rushed off to round up some more stray Gryffindors.</p>\n<p>For his own sanity and his own wish to hurry things along, Draco did do Harry's biding. Mother was chatting with Aunt Andromeda, and Father was attached at Mother's side. Draco touched Mother's arm lightly to get her attention.</p>\n<p>Mother smiled. \u201cOh, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry wants us to get ready for the photo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Aunt Andromeda said. She linked arms with Mother, and the pair moved towards the larger group; Father passively followed them.</p>\n<p>The Weasleys and Harry's Gryffindor friends had largely congregated together. Draco was rather unsurprised to see Luna Lovegood conversing with Blaise and Theo\u2014it was <em>Lovegood</em>, after all\u2014but he was surprised to see Pansy talking to Ginevra Weasley. He wondered if his grandfather was rolling around his grave\u2014and whether Father was as blank about it all as he looked: in the last few days leading up to Christmas, Malfoy Manor had been swarming with Weasleys and Gryffindors, and the occasional Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was the happiest Draco had ever seen his home to be.</p>\n<p>Harry's arm slipped around his waist. \u201cI'm so happy,\u201d he murmured.</p>\n<p>Draco raised an eyebrow, giving the loud group a pointed look. \u201cAbout that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry just gave him a little smile. \u201cKind of. Let's go, we're going to stand near the presents. That way, you get to open your presents first, right after the photo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you implying that I have such little self control?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cI know you're just a little kid inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco breathed into Harry's ear. \u201cIt wasn't a child you wanted last night.
