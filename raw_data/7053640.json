  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>am </em>being quiet! This is as quiet as we get!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet you <em>still</em> speak, and you crash through the trees as though you were a herd of Oliphaunts! Do you mean to run into every single one?\u201d Legolas growled, and he rubbed at his forehead. There was a tension headache building just behind his eyes. Why had he offered to scout ahead again?</p>\n<p>Oh yes, that was it. He had wanted some respite from the crashing, noisy, foul-mouthed and foul-natured Dwarves. They moved in slow, stately procession through the Greenwood now, returning to the seat of their old Kingdom. Elves had been set to guide and guard every wagon and train, to ensure their safety and protect their own lands.</p>\n<p>But his moment of peace was not to be: not to be outdone, the very worst of the lot had offered to join him. \u2018Lightest, swiftest and youngest,\u2019 he remembered the Dwarf saying, his peach-fuzz jaw out-thrust.</p>\n<p>The others had glanced warily up at their escort. None were outright hostile, but neither were they friendly. Cautious, that was the word. The older Dwarves were cautious; guarded and closed. They gave nothing away in word, expression or deed. Yet it was clear that they did not trust Legolas to leave them.</p>\n<p>Finally, the leader (a strong-shouldered Dwarf with blue eyes and dark hair and beard), had nodded. \u201cMind your path,\u201d was all she said.</p>\n<p>Legolas had not cared for his tiny tag-along. He was noisy, and grumbling, and despite his claims he was neither light, nor swift. Young he surely was, by the look of the fluff upon his chin. Resentful and irritable, Legolas had not spared the Dwarf from the sharp side of his tongue, nor from the hardest paths he could take through the clinging forest.</p>\n<p>Yet the little one was not daunted by either his tone or his expression. He puffed his chest out in indignation, and his dark eyes flashed. \u201cYou needn\u2019t stay and guard me, if my company irks you so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would be lost in seconds,\u201d Legolas said immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I must put up with your insulting words and insulting stares, and it is for my own good, you mean to say.\u201d The Dwarf snorted loudly and derisively. \u201cIt would suit me better to be rid of you. I can see the paths ahead just as well as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That, Legolas doubted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am charged with your safety.\u201d And Legolas cursed the fortune that had placed him upon guard-duty for this particular caravan - and not for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, so you\u2019ve said, every single time.\u201d The Dwarf pushed past a liana, his violently-bright hair sliding into his eyes. His steps crushed the leaf-litter, crackling noisily, a dead giveaway to the dangerous creatures of the forest. And his breathing was clearly audible from yards away! \u201cWe know you do this under duress, you needn\u2019t remind us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas was so shocked at this, he stopped short. Then he ran on light feet to catch up with the small Dwarf, his curiosity rising. \u201cAnd what mean you by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Dwarf did not look back at him. \u201cOnly what I say, your most lofty Highness. That you do not wish to be here with us, any more than I wish to be here with you. It would have been kinder not to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it,\u201d said Legolas, taken-aback by both the Dwarf\u2019s bluntness and by his accuracy.</p>\n<p>The Dwarf looked at him then, and grim amusement was in the dark eyes. \u201cAh, well. I can claim no more than sixty-three summers under my belt, and am young and foolish. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas opened his mouth, but had not the words to answer that.</p>\n<p>Then the Dwarf swore loudly, and unlimbered the axe he wore at his belt. Legolas flinched and reached for his bow, but the axe flew wide over his shoulder and struck something with a heavy, wet <em>thud.</em></p>\n<p>Turning, he saw the body of a spider toppling from its line onto the forest floor, its legs curling up around the bulbous belly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese things! My father has spoken of them,\u201d the Dwarf grunted, and he stomped forward with his dreadful noisy feet to yank his axe out of the thing and wipe it against the bristling hide. \u201cAnd where one creeps, more are sure to follow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey make colonies amidst the trees,\u201d Legolas said, still staring at the spider. How had the Dwarf even seen it? They had dull eyes and were inattentive creatures at best. How had he known? \u201cThis may have been doing even as we do: scouting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we had best move on before the others wonder where it has got to,\u201d the small Dwarf said, tucking his axe back into his belt and hitching it up on both hands. Then he noticed the look upon Legolas\u2019 face, and grinned broadly.</p>\n<p>It was the first open expression he had seen on the Dwarf\u2019s face, and it transformed him completely. Gone was the bristling sour mistrust, and only clear mirth shone back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWondering how I saw it, eh?\u201d the Dwarf said, still with that bright wide smile on his face. It was a pleasant smile, Legolas thought \u2013 before stifling it. \u201cWe have a saying, amongst our people. \u201cDark mines make for open eyes\u201d. We\u2019re not much for wide spaces and long distances and bright sunshine, that\u2019s true enough. You want an Elf for that. But for seeing in the dark? Choose a Dwarf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thank you,\u201d said Legolas stiffly.</p>\n<p>The young Dwarf shrugged, before stumping back the way they came. \u201cCome along, your noble Twigness. Your unpleasant duty still awaits you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have enough of it here,\u201d Legolas muttered, but sprang after the Dwarf nevertheless.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is <em>Mirkwood!</em> See, it even says so on our maps!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dwarf</em>-maps, what would they know! Why not ask one who lives here, Master Mole? This is Greenwood the Great, and has been since before the lighting of the stars!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and so much of it is green? Look at the bloody place, this is murkier than the bottom of a bog!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething I am sure you are well-acquainted with, smelling as you do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cElves, obviously. All the great works of every age have been made by them. They are clearly the superior craftspeople.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you, you <em>dirty - </em>\u00a0you say such lies even when history is filled with instances of your folk gouging and robbing mine for the works of our hands! What of the Dragon-helm, what of Menegroth, what of Angrist, what of-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI say only the truth. T\u2019was an Elf made the silmarils-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, and so much joy came of them! Such an achievement, and so maturely handled!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one word in answer to that, Master Mole! <em>Nauglamir.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOr so your folk name it. Do you think we would name it such? <em>Treasure of the stunted ones: </em>how kind and gracious the fair folk can be!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAn axe, naturally. Bows are all very good for those without the skill and courage to fight their foes face-to-face, but the axe is a far superior weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you ambulatory shrubs were capable of even drawing the bow-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we use them, and far stronger ones than you could bend, Twig-Princeling. Just saying what all know to be so. The axe is a better weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet I have slain more spiders than you have hairs upon your chin <em>with my inferior bow,</em> Master Mole. Though that is not doing my count justice, considering that pitiful beard\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow DARE-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Legolas deposited his unwelcome burden at the Gates of Erebor, and was escorted to the Throne Room where he was to be received. The curse of his father\u2019s crown: even when he would rather slip back into his trees, he must pay the proper courtesies.</p>\n<p>He bowed stiffly to the King, Prince Consort and attendant Lords. \u201cMy duty is discharged, Majesty,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d the Hobbit replied, and thrust his thumbs into his belt. He rocked back upon his heels in thought as he squinted up at Legolas. \u201cYou seem a little\u2026 harried. I\u2019ve worn that face a time or two, when expecting relatives over for tea. Was it an eventful journey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas did not allow so much as a muscle of his face to twitch. His father would <em>disown </em>him for showing weakness before the rulers of Erebor. \u201cThere were no major conflicts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Unless you count my near-hourly battles with young Master Mole.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBut plenty of skirmishes,\u201d said the Leader of the caravan-train, entering without fanfare and with her pack still on her back, \u201cand not with the spiders either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSister!\u201d The King flew from the throne to embrace her, and there was indeed a resemblance Legolas realised. The King smiled down at her, and she pushed good-naturedly at him with a laugh. A comfortable, sibling-like interaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cDis! Back safe!\u201d cried the lord Dain, and he slapped the Dwarf\u2019s back. \u201cSo cousin, from that statement I\u2019m guessing that you haven\u2019t been your normal serene self, eh? A few tempers flaring, that sort of thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dis huffed in fond amusement. \u201cI needn\u2019t lose my temper at all, not when our youngest kinsman is around to do so for all of us combined, cousin. His puts mine to shame any day of the week. They <em>despised </em>each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kinsman \u2013 to the Princess Dis, sister of King Thorin? Master <em>Mole?</em></p>\n<p>Oh curses. Legolas winced internally. Naturally, his grumbling little opponent had to be someone of consequence, thus risking a diplomatic incident. <em>Naturally.</em></p>\n<p>The King was watching Legolas now with a measuring look in his blue eyes. \u201cI had hoped for peace between the Mountain and the Wood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s but a child still.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dis rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, he got as good as he gave, don\u2019t you fret none, Thorin. Theirs was the only real contention, and it mostly consisted of finding more and more inventive ways to give each other insult. There have been some truly beard-curling ones, too! They never came to blows, thank Mahal, and the only wounds were tender feelings. The rest of the Elves were all right: stuffy and snobbish, to be sure, but all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stuffy!?<em> Snobbish!?</em></p>\n<p>Legolas was beginning to see that Master Mole was most definitely related to the Lady Dis.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt eases my heart to hear that,\u201d said the King. He didn\u2019t look eased; he looked highly satisfied that the elven Prince had been so thoroughly insulted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my nerves,\u201d Bilbo added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to broker another peace like the one between you and Thranduil again. I nearly had to nail both your feet to the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, and I had to guard the damn door. Not to keep you from interruption, but to stop you both from leaving in dramatic high dudgeon,\u201d Dain grinned. Thorin glowered at his cousin with mock-annoyance. \u201cIsn\u2019t it nice that we all get along, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shall box his ears, when I find him,\u201d Thorin muttered, and Dis laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAye: right before you gift him with a fine new set of armour, or some such?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologise for our young kinsman\u2019s rudeness,\u201d said Thorin, pulling himself straighter and turning away from his merrily chuckling cousin and sister. \u201cI hope this can be marked down to his youth and inexperience. He is young and brash, not yet of age. No doubt time will bring him wisdom. I assure you, his words do not represent Erebor. We remain Thranduil\u2019s ally and friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the end of this (rather gritted) little speech, Bilbo patted his husband\u2019s hand as though to say \u2018there! Well done, dear!\u2019</p>\n<p>Thorin\u2019s face melted at once, and both Dis and Dain were repressing smiles.</p>\n<p>The words \u2018stuffy and snobbish\u2019 were still ringing in Legolas\u2019 ears. He bowed to cover his confusion, and as he straightened he caught sight of his Master Mole, tucked into one of the deep shadows of the Throne Room. Then he smiled faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thank you for the apology, King Thorin, but it is no matter to concern you,\u201d he said, allowing his voice to ring through the room. \u201cSuch pitiful arguments could not have swayed nor daunted me, and the ill-mannered temper of a beardless stripling is as the wailing of the wind.\u201d</p>\n<p>He heard the low, shocked gasp in the shadows, and inwardly he smiled to himself. <em>And that is another to my count.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI will say, however,\u201d he said, pretending thoughtfulness and allowing his voice to slow, \u201cthat it is long centuries since any have argued with me for so long and with such a passion, to such a sorry result.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with his head held triumphant, Legolas turned from the Throne Room and left Erebor and Master Mole behind him.</p>\n<p>(Dain watched him go with his old, knowing eyes, and a faint suspicion dawned.</p>\n<p>No. No, surely not.</p>\n<p>Foolish notion.)</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Most High and Poncy Prince Twig,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Nice try, you ASS. You know, that was a very good show of not giving a damn. But your ears heat when you are embarrassed or angry. They were brightest red, redder than my hair even. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Caught you in your lie, that is one point to me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Signed,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli son of Gloin</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Legolas held the letter in clenched fingers. The writing was thick and blocky and somewhat unpractised: shaky and ill-formed, as though the author were far more used to writing in a different script than the curling loops of the tengwar.</p>\n<p>\u201cLegolas, what are you scowling for?\u201d asked Tauriel, glancing at him with concern in her eyes. \u201cAre you well? Your ears are red.\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas growled and tore the letter in two in a sudden fit of annoyance. The halves fluttered to the ground behind him as he stalked away.</p>\n<p>Tauriel picked them up and scanned the contents.</p>\n<p>And began to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Master Mole,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your information is incorrect. But no doubt you must be used to that. It must be wearisome to be so constantly wrong about the world. I would think it burdensome to know so little, but perhaps in your ignorance you find comfort. After all, you know no better.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Also, my ears are no business of yours. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ever.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas Greenleaf</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Gimli read through the letter, and was roaring with laughter by the end. Kili nearly dropped his fork. \u201cGim, what in Mahal\u2019s name\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gasping, speechless and weak with laughter, Gimli waved the letter in the air and let Kili snatch it from him. Then he subsided back in his chair, still giggling. \u201cOh, I got him, I got him all right,\u201d he said between his wheezing.</p>\n<p>Kili\u2019s eyebrows rose slowly as he read through the letter, and they were nearly crowding his hairline by the end. \u201cLegolas Greenleaf? As in the Prince of Mirkwood Legolas Greenleaf?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s the one. But it\u2019s the Greenwood, if you ask him. Don\u2019t call it Mirkwood, mind.\u201d Gimli wiped at his eyes and slapped his knees. His grin was blinding. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t a rejoinder, and all he can do is fume. Another point to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a very rude letter,\u201d Kili said, handing it back. \u201cIf uncle finds out-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, what can it do? Everyone knows that our hatred for each other is personal and not political,\u201d Gimli scoffed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say anything to destabilise the peace. What do you take me for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA beardless little idiot,\u201d Kili said promptly, and was immediately kicked in the shin beneath the table by Gimli\u2019s steel-capped boot.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what does that make <em>you</em>, with half as much beard and twice as much idiot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili pulled a face at him, before nodding to the letter. \u201cDon\u2019t get carried away or do anything thick, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, <em>you\u2019re </em>warning me\u2026 right, who are you and where is Prince Kili.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d Kili turned back to his own mail, and brightened when he saw the star-embossed green envelope. \u201cAh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you tell <em>me</em> not to get carried away,\u201d Gimli said, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Prince Jackass,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ah, a brave try! But your clumsy attempts at deflecting me have only highlighted the omission. I have seen more of the world than you, young though I am. And so that insult has fallen flat \u2013 rather like your singing voice.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your ears were burning, burning red. I\u2019ve seen rubies with less fire. I shall cherish the memory always. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I know you will never, ever, <u>ever</u> forget it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sincerely,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli son of Gloin</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Thranduil was slightly concerned about his son\u2019s behaviour. He tore at his hair and paced angrily, muttering all the while. Every so often he would peer at himself in the mirror, and one forefinger would come to rest upon the delicate point of his ear \u2013 an ear that was flushed cherry-red with fury.</p>\n<p>Then Legolas would spin away from his reflection in redoubled agitation, growling beneath his breath. He would go out and shoot at spiders for a few hours, only to catch sight of his reading-desk or mirror (what was so obnoxious about a reading-desk, for Elbereth\u2019s sake?) and descend into thunderous simmering once more.</p>\n<p>He had enquired of Tauriel, discreetly, but his Captain had only smiled at him, unruffled and a little mischievous. She had reassured him that Legolas\u2019 disquiet was nothing to raise alarm.</p>\n<p>\u201cA dispute with a friend,\u201d she said, her cheeks dimpling.</p>\n<p>\u201cA friend? What about?\u201d Thranduil had never seen his son this discomfited.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, whether or not they can be friends,\u201d Tauriel said, and with that cryptic statement and a flash of scarlet hair, she was gone into the woods.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hairy Earthworm,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My singing voice is the envy of all Greenwood, and if certain Dwarves had ears of any discernment they would not say such pathetically embarrassing things. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Still, with the ears you DO have, perhaps it is no surprise. You seem to love to speak of mine, but yours could double as one of the shovels you so love. Do they flap insects away in hot weather?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You have seen more of the world, perhaps. You have made journeys then? Yet I have lived in this Middle-Earth for over two millennia. Your ridiculous posturing seems to me to be akin to that of the red squirrel, who chatters incessantly and says nothing of consequence.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Have you even a beard yet?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>In some disgust,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas Greenleaf</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>There was much stamping and grumbling and thudding going on next door.</p>\n<p>Gimli was in a foul temper this evening, thought Gloin, as he pushed a game-piece forward. Dain was his opponent, and the Lord of the Iron Hills was studying the board intently even as a crash came from the next room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in Mahal\u2019s blessed name-\u201d Gloin burst out, but Dain held up a hand at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour boy\u2019s getting a good education right now, don\u2019t you go in an\u2019 spoil it,\u201d he said without looking away from the board. \u201cHe\u2019s learning that one or two early victories do not win a war. Aha.\u201d And he moved a piece.</p>\n<p>Gloin scratched at the scar over his eyebrow. \u201cBut I really ought to go and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him deal with his own bout of petulance, and clean up his own mess,\u201d Dain said, and he leaned back in his chair. \u201cDo him good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should go find out what is bothering the lad, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dain laughed lightly. \u201cAh, you\u2019re a good father, cousin. Let him tell you if he wishes, but don\u2019t go a-prying. That\u2019s what I found helped the most, when my own lad was in his sixties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Good advice, Gloin supposed, but he glanced back at the door anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it helps, I\u2019ll keep an eye on him,\u201d Dain offered. \u201cHe\u2019s got a sensible head on his shoulders, when he doesn\u2019t lose it due to that hair-trigger of his.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what could have upset him so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dain grinned. \u201cI suspect the post just arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Prince Haughty Cur,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ve more beard than you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli son of Gloin</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Mud-eater,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is that your best effort? Come, you were doing well.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas Greenleaf</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Conceited Prick,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ve said all I wish to say to you. Leave me alone now.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli son of Gloin</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGalion,\u201d said Legolas, and there was a furrow in his brow that had not been there before. \u201cI require a bottle of wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA bottle of wine?\u201d That was an unusual request. The Prince rarely imbibed, unlike his father. It usually signalled some inner distress when Legolas chose to take more than a glass at meals. \u201cRed or white?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt matters not,\u201d Legolas said gloomily.</p>\n<p>Then he straightened at once, and said, \u201cno \u2013 no, red. The Dorwinion, have we any of the pressing of fifteen years ago left?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBarely any: you know it\u2019s the King\u2019s favourite,\u201d Galion said, but he dutifully made his way to the rack in question and pulled down a dusty bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s too fine a drop to waste on melancholy, my Prince\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no I need it for, for something other than easing my mind,\u201d Legolas said eagerly, and he took it in quick hands. \u201cThank you, Galion \u2013 it will be well, you shall see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Galion watched him go, his tread far far lighter than it had been upon arrival, and shook his head. What was in that blond head these days?</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I fear I have crossed a line.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This wine is my father\u2019s favourite: a Dorwinion Red. It is fearfully strong, so kindly pace yourself and do not make yourself sick.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The colour is deepest red. It is the same shade as your hair \u2013 and my ears, when I am angry.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you would, I would like to hear about your journeys.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas Greenleaf</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracted,\u201d Dwalin barked. \u201cPay attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gimli shook his head, wiping his brow with a forearm and blinking the sweat from his eyes. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said, before taking his pose again with the axe held up by the side of his face. His knees bent slightly as he prepared for Dwalin\u2019s attack.</p>\n<p>The old warrior gave no quarter, and rushed him with all his strength and cunning. Gimli was his best student, and it was proving more and more difficult to give the lad a proper challenge. Yet today, he blocked and parried without his usual crisp flair, and his attacks were half-hearted at best.</p>\n<p>Dwalin disarmed him in half the usual time, and grunted deep in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re in no shape at all today,\u201d he said. \u201cGo and shower and come back when you have a mind to work!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- yes, Dwalin,\u201d said Gimli, lowering his eyes.</p>\n<p>Dwalin softened. It was unlike the boy to not have a witty retort, or even a grumble. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s preying on your mind, lad, but take care eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gimli looked up, and his answering smile was small. \u201cI will be well enough. I am simply confused. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever it is, don\u2019t let it drag you down.\u201d Dwalin cuffed the lad\u2019s bright red hair, and Gimli\u2019s smile broadened into a grin. Ah,<em> there</em> he was. \u201cBut do not strike before the metal is cold, neither. Allow yourself some time, and judge your moment. Like you would an axe-blow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Dwalin.\u201d Gimli gathered up his axe and began to trudge from the training-floor. He looked deep in thought, and Dwalin wondered what <em>that </em>was all about.</p>\n<p>It was unlike Gimli to be so subdued, after all.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The wine is indeed very red. I thank you. I had two glasses, and nearly slept to noon the following day. I could barely train with my axe that afternoon. My teacher noticed my sluggishness and sent me away. I hope he could not tell the effects of Dorwinion wine upon a Dwarf!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I confess that I overreacted. I do that on occasion. My ears are after all, very large. I cannot shoo flies away with them, alas. Too, I do not have much beard as yet, but I have hopes enough for the future. And I may not be two thousand years old, but I am no simpleton.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0I will also say that the part that stung the most was the sign-off. As much as you have irked and infuriated me, you do not disgust me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> <strike>Further, I do not hate your singing in the slightest</strike> </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have travelled all over the North with my father. I was born in the Blue Mountains, and we have travelled to the Shire for many winters over the years, selling our wares and crafts and skills in order to bring food when times are lean. I have been to Bree once, where few Dwarves are. The Men pay poorly, but the Hobbits are generous with their food, and for that we have been thankful.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have seen the ocean, gathering clouds over the endless expanses of blue that seem to swallow the eye. I have seen old ruins, left by the High Kings of Fornost, crumbling in stately decay. They knew their trade, those old Men of the West!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Misty Mountains are still the most fearsome journey I have made. We were beset by goblins at the pass. My mother and I held the rear as Lady Dis fought the in the van, and we nearly lost two of the wagons. I would rather face one of the Spiders of <strike>Mirk</strike> Greenwood again! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tell me of the passing of so many years. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Most Travelled Dwarf, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Why, you have a touch of the poet in you, I think. That has come as something of a surprise.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am glad your teacher did not notice the aftereffects of the wine. I am doubly glad that you have accepted my peace-offering.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have rarely been from under the eaves of my forest. But Greenwood the Great is she, and she stretches between Mountains and over lakes and rivers, a sea in and of herself \u2013 but one of rolling green instead of blue, shifting and deadly and beautiful. I have never grown tired of her infinite changes, or her many moods. She is gentle and merry in the spring, elegant and languid in summer, radiant and stormy in the autumn months, and stately as a queen in her frozen winter mantle. Her darkness has not detracted from her beauty, not at all: rather, she wears it as one does a proud scar, a sign of sorrow that makes all joys seem more bright and blissful. No matter how many centuries I live, I will never grow weary of the voices of the trees. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The years do not weigh on me yet. I am not young as we account our people, though I am not old either. I do not know how it is, for mortals. I know you are young as yet, but I have read the words of ancients amongst the race of Man, and they seem to understand how years may roll together into a seamless cloth. It is only when one stands back that the pattern may be seen.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I admit that I have not been fair to you, singling you out in such a way. I am an adult long grown, and you are not. Your tongue is quick and your wit keen, and I never felt as though I were trading blows with an unequal opponent \u2013 far from it! <strike>You do not disgust me, instead I find myself intrigued</strike></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You have seen the sea! Alas, for Elves have a great longing and love towards it. The call from long ago still resounds even in the little rivers and lakes of my home, but to hear the clarion bell of the ocean waves would stir such a yearning in my heart. What did you do there? Tell me more if it, I beg you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI have something amusing to tell you,\u201d said Tauriel, laying in Kili\u2019s arms, her head pillowed upon his breast. She could hear his deep and steady heart under her ear, and thrilled at it. The scar under her fingers was still slightly red and proud, but it would fade over the years. \u201cIt concerns my Prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d said Kili indistinctly, his thick fingers toying with her hair. Then he began to snigger, his belly jolting her head up and down. \u201cDoes it have to do with a small, hotheaded cousin of mine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed it does,\u201d she said, and turned in his arms to grin up at his face. \u201cThey continue to write each other, though it has been nearly a year since the journey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am astonished that the letters don\u2019t actually catch fire,\u201d Kili said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some truly blistering insults in those. Gimli has a wicked tongue when he is on a roll!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Legolas can be as caustic and icy as a winter wind when he so wishes,\u201d Tauriel agreed. \u201cYet my Prince no longer stalks about in fury after the messenger birds arrive. He is full of thoughtful looks and pauses now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili hesitated, and then frowned. \u201cCome to think of it, Gimli\u2019s quieter than usual of late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it that is somewhat unusual,\u201d Tauriel said mischievously, and kissed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met him, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am unlikely to forget the experience!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not thick, for all that he has a mouth on him.\u201d Kili brushed the backs of his fingers against her face, his brow still furrowed. \u201cI wonder what\u2019s going on there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have enclosed a shell from one of the little beaches I walked upon. The sand was grey-brown, but I could barely make it out beneath the thousands and thousands of these tiny shells. They crunched beneath my feet, which alarmed me greatly at first. But then my mother told me that the small creatures that once called them home had departed, and this was why the shells now lay empty and washed up upon the shore.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I kept some, to remind me of that day. The wind was bitingly cold and laden with the smell of salt and the mustier scent of sea-weeds. There were birds that wheeled high, calling in piercing mournful voices. They were returning to their nests in the nearby cliffs that tumble down into the sea \u2013 the Blue Mountains have eroded and shattered still further since the waters swallowed so many of their number. Now no dwarves live in the westernmost halls, so treacherous and prone to collapse and flooding: only the sea-birds and bats and creeping animals come here now, roosting where my people once made lamps of light and glory.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And of course, myself and my mother upon one memorable year, gathering salt to dry, fishing at dawn and dusk. The wind made my nose and eyes water and turn red, as I remember.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The shell is like those Mountains, to me. It is cracked upon its rim, and the outside is tough and dull-looking, unlovely and squat. But turn it over, and the myriad shifting colours of white opal, pearl and moonstone shine back at you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The way you speak of your forest moves me. I have always felt attached to this place, this Lonely Mountain, though I never laid eyes on it until last year. It is our home, and yet it is not. We grow into it over time, and perhaps one day it will fit us as well as the shell once fitted its watery inhabitant.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But you have lived beneath those trees for countless years and it is more than home to you, it is a skin you wear as close as your own. No wonder you took the name \u2018Greenleaf\u2019.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I thank you for your forgiveness, and I must apologise once more for spoiling our game. You are gracious in victory.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Nay! I do not count it a victory, for I overshot my mark and hurt you when I truly had no intent to do so. Do not hold yourself accountable when it was my part to play the role of the responsible one, and I failed. I count myself fortunate that you have forgiven me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Though \u2013 if you should care to play another game? I slew seven spiders only this week, with my bow. I await your answer, most noble Mole.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I had not considered your people's troubles, not in all my \u2018countless years\u2019 (let me assure you, they are countable!). I think that we of the Eldar put out of mind the sufferings your folk have endured, for it is easier and more natural to us to dwell upon our own misfortunes. But to hear that your mother and yourself (I discern from your tale that you were a very young child at the time) were gathering salt in a dangerous place\u2026 your father journeying far and wide to sell wares to Men who cared little for its quality\u2026. yes, hard times indeed. I sorrow for your people\u2019s losses. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I know in time that the Mountain shall fit you as well as the beautiful little shell. And, like the mountain, it shall house great beauty beneath its cap.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It still smells of brine, and the colours upon the inside are a fascination to me. They shift and swirl so! I thank you from the bottom of my heart. To have such a token of the sea is a glorious gift, and proof of your kindness.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your mother was not among those in the caravan, was she? I do not recall her. I hope I did not give her insult!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The leaves are turning red once more. The songs of the forest have turned from slow lazy melodies of basking in the midday sun to such a tempestuous defiant chorus! The trees claw and thrash against the winds, and they don their most radiant garb in the face of the encroaching frosts. I admire their steadfastness, and their ability to endure.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Thorin said, rubbing at his brow tiredly. \u201cWith Dain\u2019s folk gone back home for the winter, we\u2019re short on numbers\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve some promising young ones,\u201d Dwalin rumbled. \u201cSome of which are even of age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorinj glanced up at him. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, couple of dozen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not condone sending children out to fight,\u201d Thorin said, his jaw firming. \u201cNot for all the mithril in the Misty Mountains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, neither would I. But guard-duty? That they can handle, and well enough. Wouldn\u2019t send them out on patrol.\u201d Dwalin stopped, chewing his lip. \u201cExcept Gimli, perhaps. He\u2019d learn a thing or two, and we could place him amongst the more experienced warriors to watch his back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGimli?\u201d Thorin pushed back the papers upon his desk, slumping in his chair and frowning up at Dwalin. \u201cHe\u2019s sixty-five\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn\u2019 he\u2019s my best student, Thorin.\u201d Dwalin shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen in <em>decades</em>, to be frank. But he needs a challenge before he gets too complacent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGloin will string our balls on a necklace if anything happens to the lad,\u201d Thorin warned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Dwalin said, waving a meaty hand in dismissal. And that, more than anything, told Thorin how very ready Gimli was for combat. \u201cBut now that he\u2019s beating me in the ring I need to step him up to a proper skirmish. He\u2019s faced goblins, to be sure, but not in an organised manner, and the only battles he\u2019s seen since are friendly training bouts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve trained alongside you: there\u2019s nothing friendly about your duels,\u201d Thorin said dryly. \u201cAll right, Gimli may be added to the patrol roster, but only in a limited capacity and only with sufficient numbers to protect him. I\u2019m not having Gloin come at me with any accusations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSend him to me, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd have both my treasurer and my general dead of axe-poisoning? No thank you. I\u2019ll get Bilbo to talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBilbo\u2019s as ornery as you are. He\u2019s just a lot more proper about it,\u201d said Dwalin, folding his arms and looking unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. He won\u2019t be swayed. And Gloin\u2019s fond of him.\u201d Thorin then wrinkled his nose. \u201cWait, Gimli\u2019s beating <em>you?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Dwalin ignored that with beautiful disdain.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Legolas,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am to join the ranks of the patrols! As an apprentice-warrior still, but I shall be counted amongst journeymen and masters! It is a great honour to be promoted thus: the other apprentices are stuck on guard duties and border watches, and are heartily jealous of me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sadly, o point-eared beanpole, I must concede that your tally outstrips mine. We are rather low on giant spiders in Erebor. I slew a fine mug of ale or two in celebration of my new-found fortune, however.\u00a0 Perhaps on patrol I shall find an opportunity to match you again.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Aye, my mother was indeed with me on our journey. And I am afraid you did give her insult, which did not endear you to me at the time! She is the dark-skinned Dwarf with the tightly-curled hair and beard, oftentimes seen at the side of the Lady Dis. Her name is Millis, and I have my eyes and complexion from her. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The song of the trees is a strange concept to me, but a beautiful one. I cannot hear it, but from your descriptions it must be glorious indeed. I have stopped upon the slopes of the Mountain where the juniper and blackberry grow, pricking my ears to catch any hint of song, to no avail. The wind hissing in the branches is all I can discern. <strike>I would have you teach me how to hear it</strike></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But you bring to my mind something that you perhaps have not heard \u2013 or rather, felt. The songs of the earth are as varied and myriad as there are minerals in it, and standing in the halls of my forebears I can feel diamonds, quartz, black ore and emeralds humming back to me in their deep tones. In Ered Luin all was muffled by the woolly drone of sandstone, but here in this good black rock, forged in fire, their voices sound so clear and true. I have now held an uncut diamond in my hand and felt it calling against my skin, high and pure and thrilling, telling me which way to shape it so as to release its beauty. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you reading, that you smile so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas spun around, a swiftly-hidden look of guilt upon his face. Thranduil, standing in the doorway of his son\u2019s solar, frowned ever so slightly. It was an expression that none could have discerned unless they knew him well.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, nothing Ada.\u201d Legolas seemed embarrassed, and he placed a hand with too-casual carelessness upon the papers of his table and shuffled them around.</p>\n<p>Thranduil knew his son, and knew when he was dissembling. He tilted his head. \u201cAre you at peace?\u201d</p>\n<p>That elicited a smile. \u201cOh yes! I am well enough, and content enough, though my feet itch for travel. May I go hunting in the northern reaches this moon, if you have no need of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thranduil was still, silent, considering. \u201cI have no requirement of you. Do that which makes you happy. Perhaps a journey will cure you of your unrest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas beamed as though he were a fifty-year-old once more. \u201cThank you, Ada!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring back a report upon the doings of the Dwarves,\u201d Thranduil added, as he swept from the room. His last sight was of his son\u2019s rather chagrined face.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Gimli,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is fine news, and I congratulate you! Your skills with the axe must now be formidable indeed, for you were gifted enough when you cleaved spiders alongside me over two years ago.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Two years! How fleet time can be! I would not have paid any attention to it, not so long ago. But now our correspondence places tide-marks along the smooth river of my life. How peculiar it is, to see time through your eyes! I thank you, it is a sight worth seeing.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have enclosed a gift for your new appointment. Wear it well and in safety!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am filled with dismay that I have offended your lady mother. I would pass on my sincere apologies, but I am unsure whether our correspondence is common knowledge amongst your kin. If so, please convey my deepest shame and contrition to her. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I can already hear your rejoinder, my friend. No, our letter-writing is not widely known amongst the Elves here. My father remains unaware, but Tauriel knows of it (and finds it highly amusing). I think she believes that we are still at each other\u2019s throat. Well, we did argue long and loudly - loudly enough to shake the birds\u2019 nests from the trees! We shall become a legend of incivility, I think, and none shall ever believe that we have since become friendly.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ah, but what you heard in the juniper and blackberry bushes <u>was</u> the song! The wind, the percussive creak of bough, the hiss of leaves, the skitter of the burrowing insects just beneath the bark, the slow groan of new growth: these together and more make the song of the forest. You do yourself an injustice when you say you cannot hear it. You may not be able to make out the words, so to speak, but certainly you hear the melody.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My heart is full of your words about the song of stone! What a wonder! It strikes me that perhaps I may be able to hear it one day, if you were to show me how best to listen. I have peered into the depths of my father\u2019s favourite white gems, and found nothing but silence and a cool snowlike shimmer. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Remain safe, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Prince, what are we doing here? We are <em>far</em> past the borders of your father\u2019s lands,\u201d Tauriel hissed. \u201cAnd if you mean to make for the Mountain I would welcome it. But it is the other way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh!\u201d Legolas said, and peered around the craggy rock that sheltered them. Towards the western sky, framed against the sunset, could be seen the peak of the Lonely Mountain. Behind them, stretching on and on into the darkening dusk, lay the Iron Hills, somewhere east. \u201cThere they are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tauriel craned her neck, trying to see. Legolas grabbed her shirt-sleeve and tugged her down. \u201cTheir eyes are keen in the dark,\u201d he muttered. \u201cStay by the stones!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are we hiding here, and who from?\u201d she asked in exasperation.</p>\n<p>Then the dull thump of heavy footsteps reached her ears, and her head whipped back to the dying glow of the sun. There, she was astonished to see a line of Dwarves, armoured and in tight-knit formation, making a careful investigation of their borders.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this why we are here?\u201d she said, and ire on behalf of her beloved began to bubble in her belly. \u201cTo <em>spy</em>? On our friends and allies, my own beloved\u2019s people, in their own\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I simply wish to see that he is safe enough, then we shall- \u201d Legolas broke off, and all at once a truly dazzling smile split his face. \u201cThere he is!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tauriel blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe smallest one, second from the end.\u201d Legolas laughed in sheer delight. \u201cAh! He has his long-awaited beard at last \u2013 and he wears my gift! I knew he would. Look at him go, Tauriel! Half the age of the others, and yet he carries his share as easily as any of them!\u201d</p>\n<p>With a dumbfounded jolt, Tauriel recognised the shock of bright, curly, untameable red hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Elbereth,\u201d she murmured, and turned back to see the look of joy upon her Prince\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Legolas,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The clasp is beautiful, and has earned me many admiring compliments. I have not said where I received it, lest the compliments turn ugly! I cannot thank you enough. It is too rich a gift, but I am too fond of it to give it up. It sits in my beard even now. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yes, my beard! My hopes have proven true, and I can now call what lives on my chin a beard without fear of argument. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My count is not seven spiders in a week, to my sorrow! Still, I can count three Gundabad orcs to my axe. You still have the advantage over me, my friend. I must visit your forest again for a chance to catch up!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have enclosed a sapphire from my family\u2019s mine. If you smooth your thumb over the facets, you may yet feel the silky glide like a descending note slipping down your spine, the sharp crispness of the edges, the glitter at its heart like the rustle of leaves given crystalline form. That is this stone\u2019s song, and your skin knows it even if your ears do not. I heard it and shaped it for you with my own hands, my friend.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have grown inordinately fond of juniper and blackberry bushes, and my fellows think me addled as a result! But I like recalling your words as I sit by them, listening to the wind stir their leaves. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have finished my first patrol, and have so impressed my superiors that they wish to season me further. I am to be send with the next food-train to the Iron Hills, to protect it as it returns with supplies for the Mountain. Lord Dain still provisions us, you see, until Dale and Esgaroth have established themselves.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>A legend of incivility! I like that! And no, it is not well known amongst my people that we are still in contact, nor that we have made peace with each other. I believe Kili knows.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And now my mother, also, for I have passed on your words. She gave me a long, hard look, and then nodded. Then she said something I did not quite understand, but perhaps you will? Her words were, \u201cHearts will as hearts must.\u201d She is full of wise sayings, but I do not know what she means by this one. Your heart meant to insult her? Hers meant to forgive? Your heart meant to feel apology? I am perplexed, and wish for the wisdom of ages to help me!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sighing like a maid in love,\u201d said Dain bluntly.</p>\n<p>Gimli jerked to attention, dropping the small thing he had been fiddling with tucked amongst the thick red curls of his beard. \u201cMy lord!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t you be \u2018My Lord\u2019ing me, cousin Gimli. I\u2019ve seen your naked infant bum racing down the hall. You call me Dain, or not at all.\u201d The Lord of the Iron Hills stooped with some difficulty, picking up the little thing that Gimli had dropped.</p>\n<p>It was a golden clip, delicate compared to the usual style of Dwarvish adornments. There were no stones embedded in it, but it was cunningly contrived. To open it, the two golden leaves could be lifted up and apart, but would snap back together so closely and tightly that you could not see the join.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty thing,\u201d Dain said, opening it and closing it to watch the leaves join together like parts of a puzzle. \u201cAnd not made by Dwarves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gimli bit his lip. \u201cUm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dain looked up at him from under his impressive brows. Gimli was nearly his height now, and was no longer a stripling. Continuous journeys and skirmishes had carved the young fiery lad into a bulky warrior, and there was little sign of the boy left in his face. But the panic in his eyes, that was <em>all </em>youth. \u201cNow, lad. You don\u2019t mean to tell me that my suspicions seven years ago were <em>correct?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is you suspected,\u201d Gimli said, strangled, \u201cand so I cannot possibly confirm it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you and Thranduil\u2019s son are a great deal more alike than anyone ever guessed,\u201d Dain said, forthright as always. Gimli swallowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI commend you on your foresight,\u201d he said eventually, his voice nearly a whisper.</p>\n<p>Dain looked down at the clasp again, and then held it out for Gimli to take. \u201cIf my foresight is of any use to you, lad,\u201d Dain said, in a far gentler tone than Gimli was expecting, \u201cdon\u2019t keep hiding away. Sure and certain, there\u2019ll be those that disapprove. But do you really need them making your decisions for you \u2013 particularly when it comes to your heart?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gimli watched the Lord stump away on his iron foot, the clasp held in his nerveless fingers.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Gimli,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I rejoice with you upon the advent of your beard! I <strike>know</strike> am sure that my clasp sets off the brightness to fine effect. May it grow ever longer! Stay safe and vigilant upon your road, my friend...</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My dear friend Legolas,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am returned! I now have a Warg to claim amongst my tally, and a fearsome foe he was too. It nicked me upon my shoulder with its claws as it writhed in its throes. It did not do anything lasting, but I shall bear the scar always, Dwalin says\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dearest Gimli, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You were wounded! That is ill-news indeed, and I am glad you were not grievously harmed\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTo your health!\u201d Fili cried, toasting Gimli. \u201cSixty-eight!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoon you shall be as wise and venerable as we are,\u201d Kili grinned.</p>\n<p>Gimli was not drinking ale, but a deep red wine that brought the flush in his cheeks forth and made his eyes glassy. He laughed, loud and deep and hearty. \u201cOh, such an achievement, to be as wise as you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, Tauriel says I am very wise,\u201d Kili said, tossing his head. His own beard was beginning to fill in, much to his joy, but of the three playfellows it was already clear that Gimli\u2019s was going to be the most magnificent.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps you can be,\u201d Gimli said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cWho knows what lies in the murky depths of that scruffy head?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fili toasted Gimli again in appreciation for the quip, and grinned at his brother\u2019s spluttering noises. \u201cNow, Gim, got any plans for your birthday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Not much,\u201d Gimli said, taking another sip of his heady wine. \u201cPerhaps go out to the Western foothills, listen to the blackberries growing. I like it out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fili stilled, and shared a look with his brother. \u201cListen to them growing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing Tauriel says,\u201d said Kili slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, but she is also suffering from the delusion that you are in any way wise,\u201d Gimli said quickly, blustering a little to cover his slip. \u201cPoor Tauriel, the stars must have addled her wits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili bristled for a moment, and then all at once he grinned in savage satisfaction. \u201cAnd is that what\u2019s going on with your green leaf? Eh, <em>Master Mole?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Gimli blinked, and his fingers tightened on the stem of his glass. \u201cYou remember? But that was years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot likely to forget,\u201d Kili said, smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this,\u201d Fili asked, looking between one and the other with a growing suspicion.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, never you mind,\u201d Gimli said, and the clasp in his beard clinked against the edge of his wineglass as he buried his face in it.</p>\n<p>Fili stared at the clasp, and wondered how Gimli had worn it for nearly a year without anyone pointing out how bloody <em>Elvish </em>it was.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas, best of friends,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Another journey! To the Blue Mountains again. A long one, and I shall be gone nearly a year if all goes aright. We go to remove the last of our people and escort them here, to the peace and prosperity of the Mountain\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My brave friend Gimli, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Another? They must think highly of you! I am filled near to bursting with pride in your speedy ascent. Yet I cannot help but recall your injury, and hope with all my heart that no such fortune awaits you\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Most worrisome friend!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I shall be well enough, now that I am almost grown and have my full height and weight \u2013 though I am sure you would say, it is not that impressive an achievement! I shall be back before the leaves of your forest turn as red as your ears again. And I swear upon my beard that I shall be careful\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>The seasons rolled on, as they always did. Legolas grew morose.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ails you?\u201d asked Thranduil, sitting by his son\u2019s side. Legolas did not even stir, looking out the window with his chin propped upon one hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am restless, and filled with frustration,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe birds call out the advent of spring, and the forest wakes after winter,\u201d Thranduil said, and he gently stroked Legolas\u2019 fine golden hair. \u201cMy son, go walk the paths of the wood. They will bring peace to your heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I have done so,\u201d said Legolas, heaving a sigh. \u201cThey do not bring me comfort today. I wish to do something of use.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thranduil paused. Then he recalled that, only yesterday, a small party of Dwarves had passed under the southern reaches and had entered the plains of the Beornings. That same party had occupied much of Legolas\u2019 attention of late, and he had seemed happy. He had even voluntarily escorted them past the dark river before returning home.</p>\n<p>Thranduil thought on it for a moment, before standing in one swift motion. \u201cIf you would do something useful, perhaps you would make an embassy to Erebor for me?\u201d he said, as casually as though he were remarking upon the weather.</p>\n<p>Legolas started and looked up slowly. That glint of guilt was back in his eye. He seemed more like the Elfling of fifty again, caught in some wrong-doing. \u201cAda, I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour life is yours, Legolas,\u201d Thranduil interrupted, if gently. \u201cBut do recall that we care for you. Would such a task please you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Legolas breathed.</p>\n<p>My son is enamoured of the Dwarves, Thranduil thought, and inwardly he heaved a sigh. \u201cAt least you have not done as Galion does, and given your affection to the bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>A flicker of confusion crossed Legolas\u2019 face, but he smoothed it hastily. \u201cAnd what messages shall I give to King Thorin, Ada?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my greetings, of course,\u201d Thranduil said, waving a negligent hand. \u201cSee if you can get a better price on silver, for what they charge now is double the cost in Thror\u2019s day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas\u2019 eyebrow twitched. \u201cI understand that they have only recently reopened the silver mines, and that the dragon had damaged much of the supports and workings. That may explain the cost.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thranduil regarded his son steadily. \u201cDid Tauriel tell you this?\u201d</p>\n<p>The reddening of Legolas\u2019 ears betrayed him, but he did not answer.</p>\n<p>Enamoured of Dwarves, and conversing with them \u2013 or at least one, thought Thranduil. Perhaps he should call on Galion before retiring for the evening. He could do with some of Galion\u2019s preferred consolation at this moment.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Most beloved friend,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m on my way home! And I have a gift for you, a jewel of the sea! It is a black pearl, and as rare a gem as can be found in this Middle-Earth. They can only be found amongst the waters of the Gulf of Lh\u00fbn, it is said.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I now have a troll to claim to my axe! I shall soon be accounted a journeyman warrior, once I have reached my majority. And that is in a matter of months only.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I would have you there, my friend and dearer than friend. I would celebrate with you by my side.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gimli</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My Gimli,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I will be there.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legolas \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI must say, you are a great deal more pleasant to deal with these days,\u201d said the Prince Consort, pouring a cup of tea and then offering it politely to Legolas. He nodded assent, consciously correct in all his manners. \u201cMillis was saying only yesterday that it\u2019s like talking to an entirely new person. Cream? Sugar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSugar, please.\u201d Legolas had no idea if he even liked Hobbit-tea with sugar, but he was flustered by the mention of Gimli\u2019s mother. Upon taking a sip, he found it inordinately sweet. He forced himself to take another.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve knowledge of Dwarves and their doings that I am absolutely positive wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d continued Bilbo, taking a taste from his own cup and sighing in satisfaction. \u201cNothing like a cup of tea, is there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Was there? Legolas wracked his mind. <em>Was</em> there anything like it, or was this another of his odd, opaque Shire sayings?</p>\n<p>The Hobbit narrowed his eyes, swirling the tea in his cup ever so slightly. \u201cYou know that the Dwarves are tremendously prickly about their secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Gimli had mentioned. He had also mentioned that he was cheerfully breaking several taboos by even saying as much. \u201cI have learned nothing that was not willingly given to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. I am sure about that, you Highness. You see, I\u2019ve had a letter from our cousin Dain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo leaned forward here, as though he expected this news to discomfit Legolas. But he only stared back in slight bewilderment. \u201cI\u2026 hope the Lord is well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Making a sound of amused exasperation, Bilbo said, \u201cyes, yes, he\u2019s as hearty as a brace of oxen. Do you care to know what Dain suspects?\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas only blinked at him in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you and your ginger nemesis are beard over boots in love with each other.\u201d Bilbo sat back, grinning. \u201cWell, obviously not beard, in your case. Nor boots. But isn\u2019t that the most preposterous thing you\u2019ve ever heard?\u201d</p>\n<p>Legolas carefully put down his too-sweet tea. His heart was pounding fit to rattle his ribs. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he heard his own voice say, before he fled the room as fast as his feet would carry him.</p>\n<p>Bilbo sipped at his tea, unperturbed, and made a mental note to write a congratulatory letter to Dain.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Legolas hovered at the Gate of Erebor, and tried not to listen to all the whispers that followed him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>\u2026fought like cat and dog all the way! Never heard such a din!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSomeone get the pails of water ready, we\u2019re about to have another battle and I don\u2019t think the Eagles will save us this time!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFour on Gimli to throw the first punch!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI came prepared. I\u2019ve goats-wool ear-plugs for sale, three gold pieces a pair.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201c</em>Three<em> gold pieces? You dirty thief, that\u2019s outrageous\u2026! Um. All right, one set for me and one for her.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>To his surprise, Bilbo came to wait with him, lighting his pipe and wriggling his furry toes. Gimli\u2019s mother was an anxious, silent presence, though he felt her eyes resting upon his back every so often.</p>\n<p>Finally, the slow snaking train of wagons and footsore Dwarves had made it through the bowl of the valley, the early autumn sun high in the sky. Legolas fancied that he could see it glancing off the brilliant red hair of one \u2013 but that Dwarf was taller and broader than his. He could not make out Gimli amongst so many.</p>\n<p>The King and his sister came forth to greet the new arrivals, and there were many embraces and many tears as families were reunited for good. The Princes were there also, and Tauriel nodded to him from her place at Kili\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Finally the crowd began to thin, and Legolas caught sight of Gimli.</p>\n<p>So changed! What time wrought on a mortal \u2013 so <em>changed</em>! He was thickset and broad, his beard long enough to twine into two plaits that reached past his bullish neck. His hands were now enormous and bulky muscle moved on him as he made his way through the crowds, greeting his people as he came. No longer a brash youth, hotheaded and impatient. Here was a warrior tested, confident and calm in his skills, easy and assured.</p>\n<p>Then his eye landed on Legolas, and his mouth dropped open.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh, here we go,\u201d</em> he heard someone groan.</p>\n<p>There was a slight pressure on his back, and Legolas spared a second away from drinking Gimli in with his eyes to see who it was. Millis, her dark eyes warm and kind, was gently pressing him forward towards her son.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d she said. \u201cHearts will as hearts must.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thanked her with a brief, glad squeeze of her hands, and then glanced up to Gloin. The Dwarf looked entirely bemused, and Millis smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle that one, if you can manage the other,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, go to him. Ionneg.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her accent was dreadful, but it gave him hope. Stumbling across to where Gimli stood locked in indecision, he licked his lips and drew himself tall. He was painfully aware of all the eyes upon them, awaiting the fight they expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cGimli,\u201d he said, but there were no more words in him past that name.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would tell you now that I have slain far more than seven spiders in a week,\u201d Gimli said, and his eyes glittered with fondness. \u201cFar, far more. You have a bit of catching up to do, Twig Princeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that, Legolas knew what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, is that the case, Master Mole?\u201d he said, and his cheeks hurt from smiling already, his whole body suffused with bright, nebulous joy. \u201cThen I had best not stray far from you. I would not have you mistrusting my count!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, nor you mine!\u201d Gimli retorted. Then one of his massive, battle-hardened hands was gripping Legolas' shirtfront and dragging him down into a long-overdue kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What.\u201d</em> Legolas dimly heard King Thorin say, in a tone as flat and disbelieving as beaten metal.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust think, dear,\u201d said Bilbo cheerfully, \u201cThranduil\u2019s own son, and your cousin! Isn\u2019t it marvellous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>And then the sweet scratch of hair upon his chin pulled him back to the moment, and Legolas surrendered. He buried his hands in Gimli\u2019s hair and kissed him, and kissed him, and Gimli held him in arms as strong as iron and as gentle as milk.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s Gimli landin\u2019 the first hit. Hard luck, you lot.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOi, Nori, that\u2019s a kiss! Not a hit! You miserable trickster, cough it up!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not have been wounded this time,\u201d Legolas breathed against surprisingly soft lips, and Gimli chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSadly, I must plead for forgiveness: I\u2019ve a new scar upon my chest. An orc, just before we reached the Carrock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Legolas let his fingers trail over the tunic\u2019s lacings at Gimli\u2019s broad throat. \u201cI think I had better spend some time ascertaining your strength, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d said Gimli, his voice rumbling and his eyes aglow with interest. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do to be in less than peak shape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Legolas said, and kissed him again.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Dain Ironfoot of the Line of Durin, son of Nain, hero of Azanulbizar and Lord of the Iron Hills, picked up his mail with a reluctant sigh. Rifling through the sketches of new mining proposals and trade tariffs, he came across a neat white envelope with Bilbo\u2019s writing upon the front.</p>\n<p>Opening it, he scanned the contents.</p>\n<p>And began to <em>roar</em> with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>END</p>"
