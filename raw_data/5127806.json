  "summary": "<p>Adrien peeked out from behind the chimney even as the magic of his own Chat Noir mask fell away.</p>\n<p>She was still visible, her dark hair bobbing under the street lamps a couple blocks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien blew out a confused breath. His fiery Ladybug\u2026 was the quiet little mouse who sat behind him in class?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat. The.\u201d</p>\n<p>This\u2026 would take some getting used to.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you get a girl to talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino choked and swallowed quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me this question?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien frowned. \u201cYou can talk to everyone. Why wouldn\u2019t I ask you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, have you listened to me? Do you hear the things that come out of my mouth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s why you\u2019re great,\u201d Adrien insisted. \u201cYou just say whatever, and people just say whatever back. How do you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino stared at him. \u201cYou are \u2014 and I use the word \u2018literally\u2019 unironically here \u2014 literally a model. What makes you think you have to do anything to get a girl to talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She eyed him suspiciously. \u201cDo you flirt with me in real life too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir tried to cover up a choke. \u201cWho\u2019s to say which part is real life, mademoiselle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug smacked his arm. \u201cDo you or do you not flirt with Marinette, you shameless pile?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir stared down at her. Flirt with Marinette? As Adrien? The concept was\u2026 new and a little bit weird but\u2026</p>\n<p>Large blue eyes met his, and a delicate pink mouth smiled at him a little bit. Ladybug. Damn, but she could make it kind of hard to breathe.</p>\n<p>Chat Noir swallowed gently. He licked his lips. \u201cThat could\u2026 be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d Alya always seemed to be super high-energy. \u201cNino said you guys wanted to check out the Dupains\u2019 new macarons, and I was like, I\u2019m coming!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs\u2026 is that what we\u2019re doing?\u201d Adrien glanced at Nino. The three of them walked down the school steps as the last students left in the fading afternoon light.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Nino punched his arm a little harder than necessary. \u201cYou know I know how much you like sea salt caramel! I am not about to let you miss out on an experience like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Right.\u201d Adrien wracked his brain as to when he\u2019d ever gotten worked up about sea salt caramel. Sweets weren\u2019t something he came into regular contact with.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys paid that much attention to the daily flavors,\u201d Alya commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nino laid a hand on his heart and gazed heavenward. \u201cWe check online every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite flavor, really. Nino\u2019s opinion notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was really close. With no mask, those big blue eyes were just\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a hard question.\u201d Marinette tapped her fingers on the counter.</p>\n<p>Something deep inside shivered at that very Ladybug tone. But. Now he kind of wanted to see blushy Marinette again. Not the one who was constantly panicked. The one who was just sort of\u2026 cutely overawed. He straightened and watched as her eyes followed him up. It was weirdly satisfying.</p>\n<p>\u201cLavender,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI know I like lavender.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette looked at him appraisingly. \u201cOh? Not a usual favorite of high-school boys.\u201d She pushed away from the counter and walked down the line of pastry cases.</p>\n<p>Adrien followed. \u201cBut you admit that I\u2019m not a usual high-school boy.\u201d This was fun. Sort of like Chat Noir with Ladybug but with\u2026 more at stake.</p>\n<p>\u201cChat, I know\u2026 I know you\u2019re up here.\u201d Ladybug\u2019s voice sounded unsure. Timid. More like Marinette. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re probably back to normal now. So. I won\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien exhaled carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sucked in a hard breath. Shit!</p>\n<p>\u201c... I guess that\u2019s a no.\u201d A shuffling noise indicated that Ladybug had sat down on the other side of the air conditioning unit. \u201cYou know, I have every right to just walk right around here and get a good look at your face once and for all. Or at least, I think I do,\u201d she finished quietly.</p>\n<p>Marinette felt her own grin falter. Adrien was still\u2026 Adrien, and he was looking at her in a way she frankly didn\u2019t know what to do with. \u201cUm.\u201d Dammit with the ums again! She tucked her hair behind her ear and glanced down into her lunchbox. \u201cWhat, um, what are you\u2026 what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d WHAT\u2019S ON YOUR MIND ARE YOU SERIOUS.</p>\n<p>Adrien blew out a breath. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you act like this around me all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s eyes flew open wide. Her mouth fell open.</p>\n<p>Adrien stared back at her.</p>\n<p>\u201c... Oops.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s almost like some people have connections or something,\u201d he pressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cConnections? To luck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you, you might have an in with good luck, right?\u201d He held her gaze, talking fast. \u201cMe, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the opposite. Of me.\u201d It was not a question.</p>\n<p>Adrien held his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou silly cat,\u201d Marinette whispered.</p>",

  "text": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien wished, for pretty much the first time ever, that he sat behind Marinette instead of in front of her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He\u2019d never cared, never thought about their seating arrangement in class before today. Before twenty-three minutes ago, to be precise. But now all he wanted to do was bore holes into the back of her head with his eyes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He\u2019d seen her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last night.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It had been an accident. Really!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He and Ladybug had gone their separate ways after a routine patrol of the city. All perfectly normal. But then Adrien had remembered that his new ad was out on a billboard a few blocks away, and he\u2019d changed course. Forgetting that Ladybug was still out there. Somewhere.</p>\n<p>Except, suddenly she wasn\u2019t out there somewhere. She was right below him, skirting behind a kiosk, a glow of light just starting to envelop her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Look away!</em> his mind screamed at him. Except he didn\u2019t. It was too fast. He was too surprised. It was too sudden. He hadn\u2019t known. He couldn\u2019t have expected. She was <em>right in front of him what could he have done really.\u00a0</em>And then\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMarinette?!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His black-haired classmate, the shyest girl he knew, cocked her head at the faint sound, and Adrien had to duck behind a chimney, slapping a black-gloved hand over his mouth. He had stayed still as stone until he heard her pad away. She was probably going home. To her parents\u2019 bakery. That wasn\u2019t too far from their school. The school they went to together. Where they sat just one row apart.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien \u00a0peeked out from behind the chimney even as the magic of his own Chat Noir mask fell away. She was still visible, her dark hair bobbing under the street lamps a couple blocks away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMarinette.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien blew out a confused breath. His fiery Ladybug\u2026 was the quiet little mouse who sat behind him in class?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat. The.\u201d</p>\n<p>This\u2026 would take some getting used to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not at your computer,\u201d Plagg observed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMmf.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien was, in fact, lying morosely on his bed, staring out the enormous bank of windows on the far wall of his room.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI comment on the fact merely to point out that you are, as it were, a creature of routine.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien blew out an annoyed sigh.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAnd at this hour, it is customary to find you checking your friend\u2019s LadyBlog,\u201d Plagg continued.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cPlagg\u2026\u201d Adrien\u2019s tone brooked caution.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAlya always updates right after school.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cPlagg!\u201d Adrien sat up and grabbed his pillow threateningly. \u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg raised an eyebrow. \u201cDear me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The pillow launched. Plagg avoided it easily.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUgh,\u201d Adrien groaned feelingly. \u201cI found out who Ladybug is.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg fell out of the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d The little black cat spirit coughed delicately into his paw. \u201cAnd she is\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien looked down at his hands in his lap.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou, ah, don\u2019t seem to be as\u2026 as <em>thrilled</em> as I expected you would be,\u201d Plagg offered hesitantly. \u201cGood heavens, who did Tikki pick this time?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien\u2019s head shot up. \u201cWho\u2019s Tikki?\u201d he asked sharply.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg\u2019s neon green eyes went wide. \u201cAh! Ahahaha. Yes. Tikki! Um. I\u2026 I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ve ever mentioned her before?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien stood and walked over to where Plagg fluttered in the air just above his desk. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t believe you ever mentioned that you know Ladybug\u2019s kwami <em>personally</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, have you met?\u201d Plagg asked weakly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTikki <em>is</em> Ladybug\u2019s kwami. Right? That\u2019s who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cLook, Adrien\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien groaned. \u201cI cannot believe you! Have you known who Ladybug is all this time too?!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe idea!\u201d Plagg crossed his tiny arms, affronted. \u201cI still don\u2019t know who she is, because you still haven\u2019t told me, as you may recall! Tikki and I make it a point to never tell each other who we\u2019ve picked. Not unless they each find out, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s Marinette,\u201d Adrien said flatly. \u201cMarinette Dupain-Cheng. From my class. Apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg cocked his head. \u201cApparently? You\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNo!\u201d Adrien wiped a hand over his face. \u201cNo, actually, I\u2019m not sure because even though I <em>saw it with my own eyes</em>, it makes zero sense!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWait, you saw her transform, right? Then it has to be her. It\u2019s not an easy effect to fake, all the sparkles and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Adrien pointed at the small black spirit. \u201c... are not helping. Marinette is definitely Ladybug. Except she can\u2019t be.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg frowned. \u201cAnd you say that because\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBecause it\u2019s Marinette!\u201d Adrien waved a hand, exasperated. \u201cShe\u2019s sweet and nice and quiet, and Ladybug is none of those things!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c... You realize you\u2019ve basically just said that Ladybug \u2014 your crush, right? \u2014 is neither sweet nor nice. And loud.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAnd Marinette\u2019s<em> shy</em>! Like, painfully shy.\u201d Adrien paced the floor in front of his desk. \u201cI think I can count on one hand the number of complete sentences she has managed to speak to me in a year.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg regarded him thoughtfully. \u201cShe can\u2019t act like a superhero all the time, right? Society generally frowns on the idea of high-school students leaping buildings in a single bound, if we're honest.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cPlagg.\u201d Adrien stood with his hands on his hips. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to be a superhero to be able to say hello to someone who\u2019s been in your class for an entire year.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With an annoyed sigh, Plagg flew to the top of one of Adrien\u2019s highest bookshelves, a sure sign he was done with the conversation. \u201cWell, she wouldn\u2019t be the first Ladybug who used the opportunity of a mask to act a bit less repressed.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien glared after him. Then sat down at his computer. After a few seconds, he learned that Alya had no new real material to publish, so today\u2019s post was full of breathy speculation about Ladybug\u2019s identity. Adrien pursed his lips. About once a week, Alya posted something like this, and once a week, he read them, combing through every last detail right along with Ladybug\u2019s number one fan.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Images of Ladybug leaping from building to building. Taking down akuma. Swinging from her yo-yo. Rolling her eyes at Chat Noir. Smiling for Alya\u2019s camera.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Repressed?</em> Adrien frowned. It was like they were two different <em>people</em>. Of course, the physical resemblance was obvious now. He might actually feel a little stupid that he hadn\u2019t seen it before. <em>Maybe that\u2019s just\u2026 part of the kwami\u2019s magic? Kind of a cloaking spell or something?\u00a0</em>And, well, he knew Marinette was smart. She had a bit of a reputation for it at school.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Okay.\u00a0So.\u00a0Same face. Same body\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien glanced at his screen and flushed. A\u00a0nice body\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And smart.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Physical appearance and intelligence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrowing his eyes, he reached for his homework and cracked open his physics textbook.\u00a0Nothing was getting answered tonight. But tomorrow.\u00a0He would be clever and suave and charming and just a bit more interested than usual. But not too much, because Marinette was Ladybug, and Ladybug would sure as hell figure out that he was up to something.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow, he would find out if there actually was a Ladybug underneath Marinette Dupain-Cheng's perpetual embarrassment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhoa.\u201d Nino\u2019s eyebrows shot above his glasses. \u201cYou get in a fight with your dad or something, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien froze before entering their classroom. \u201cNo, why, what\u2019s up, something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His friend cocked his head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, but I sure hope you don\u2019t have a photoshoot today. It\u2019s gonna take a hella lotta makeup to cover those dark circles.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien smirked humorlessly. \u201cNo fight. I just didn\u2019t sleep. Much.\u201d <em>Like, two hours?</em> While he usually fell asleep to visions of Ladybug dancing through the rooftops of Paris, he\u2019d lain awake into the wee hours of the morning analyzing every gesture, every expression that he could recall from Marinette.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Around 4 a.m., Plagg had suggested he might want to pick up a hobby or five.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nino followed him into the room. \u201cCan you even think, dude? We\u2019ve got a final in physics today.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marinette was sitting in her usual spot. Alya was trying to interest her in something on her phone, but Marinette was staring right at him. An expression that was half welcome smile and half nervous terror.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>This is Ladybug?</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">and the next thought:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>How did I ever not see those damn blue eyes?</em>\n</p>\n<p>But whatever! Adrien tried for his usual charming grin and promptly slid into the bench in front of her, right after Nino.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turns out he could not, as Nino had speculated, actually think today.\u00a0He was not looking forward to seeing his physics test score.\u00a0Every sound, every movement Marinette made hit him like a tennis ball to the back of the head.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Ladybug. Ladybug is right behind me.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Ladybug is taking physics.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>I wonder how she\u2019s doing on the test.</em>\n</p>\n<p>When the bell rang, he turned around in his seat. Smoothly, as though it were commonplace, he asked, \u201cSo how\u2019d you do?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien watched carefully as, sure enough, Marinette turned a violent shade of pink.\u00a0\u201cUm!\u201d she squeaked. \u201cF-fine!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He waited.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She stared at him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alya leaned around Marinette. \u201cShe was awesome, I know it. We studied together yesterday, and if she didn\u2019t take this test out into a back alley somewhere and <em>own</em> it, then I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow\u2026 how did you do\u2026?\u201d Marinette cut in. \u201cAdrien?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Adrien. Ladybug just said my name.</em> Which made him feel <em>so</em> good. <em>And Ladybug is Marinette.</em> Which made him feel\u2026 well. That needed to be sorted out.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNot awesome, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he admitted. He leaned back into the bench, closer to her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marinette made a weird chirping noise and backed away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien managed to keep his smile in place, but his brain blared,<em> This is Ladybug?!</em> <em>Ladybug would have shoved me back into my seat!</em> How\u2026 weird. \u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t get to sleep last night, so my concentration is way off this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded, her blush fading the tiniest bit. \u201cI have a lot of nights like that.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>I bet. Run around Paris after dark much?</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHey, man, lemme out.\u201d Nino nudged him finally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two minutes before literature, and I need, uh.\u201d He glanced back at Alya. \u201cNeed to stretch my legs,\u201d he mumbled.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien felt his smile widen for real. His friend had to go to the can, he just didn\u2019t want to say it in front of the girls. Specifically Alya, Adrien would bet anything. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He slid out of the bench.\u00a0Which meant he stood pretty much right next to Marinette. Adrien glanced at the girl out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was trying, <em>god</em>, she was trying so hard not to look at him. She bent over her notebook, but he could see she wasn\u2019t writing anything. Wow, even her ears were pink. And her neck.\u00a0An idea tickled at the back of his mind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien leaned an elbow on her desk. \u201cFixing your notes?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cY-yup!\u201d She cringed away from him. Steam was practically rolling out of her ears, she was so flustered.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMm.\u201d He reached over and tapped the open page. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to add that last formula she mentioned right before the bell.\u201d Adrien flashed her his modeling grin. \u201cI swear she does that on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Huge <em>huge</em> blue eyes finally turned on him. Long black lashes swept over prettily flushed cheeks. And perfectly smooth lips parted just enough to whisper, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Wow.\u00a0</em>Adrien kept his smile in place. Years of practice,<em> thank you</em>.\u00a0But <em>wow</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After Nino finally slid back into the bench. After the next instructor began espousing the imagination of Alexandre Dumas. After Marinette\u2019s pencil resumed scratching away at her notebook.\u00a0All Adrien could think was\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Ladybug\u2019s never said \u201cokay\u201d like that before.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBye bye, little butterfly.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir watched listlessly as Ladybug released the purified akuma from her magic yo-yo. When she threw her Lucky Charm into the air, he took note with dull interest as the neighborhood reversed the damage of the latest Hawkmoth-induced rampage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marinette was totally Ladybug.</p>\n<p>He had kept a close eye on her \u2014 even more so than usual \u2014 during their defense against an outraged mall Santa Claus. All right, the reindeer that shot laser beams from their eyes had distracted him momentarily, but for the most part, Chat Noir had kept Ladybug in his sights the entire time.\u00a0The movement, the gestures, the goddamn pigtails\u2026 it was all there. Right down to her voice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And <em>damn</em>.\u00a0Marinette\u2019s voice was <em>hot</em>. When you took out the stammering, the half-baked sentences, and all the ums and uhs, Marinette Dupain-Cheng had a confident, no-nonsense voice that plugged right into Chat Noir\u2019s Ladybug-centric mainframe. Spine chills and racing heart included. He had no clue what he was going to do about it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMission accomplished!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir blinked. Ladybug was holding out her red-gloved fist, just as she always did after every akuma they vanquished together.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c... Chat Noir?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRight! Right.\u201d He stood and walked to her. Bumped her fist lightly. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She stared at him. \u201cAll right, what is with you tonight?\u201d Ladybug stood with her hands on her hips. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, we all have our off days, but you have seriously been half-assing it this time. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Shit! She noticed!</em> \u201cMy apologies, princess. Perhaps I was just particularly mesmerized by my lady\u2019s dazzling skills tonight,\u201d he said smoothly. With a wave of his hand, he turned to walk away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOkay, now I know something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir froze, one foot in the air. He heard Ladybug walk up behind him. She spun him around with one hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou,\u201d she intoned dangerously, \u201cmissed a perfectly good pun opportunity there. \u2018Perhaps?\u2019 Like a normal person? Who are you tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Adrien. I\u2019m Adrien. And you are Marinette, and this is not how we usually interact.</em> If he hadn\u2019t already been sweating\u2014 \u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you act like this around me in real life?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both of their jaws dropped simultaneously.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir slapped a hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marinette\u2019s eyes almost popped out of her mask. \u201c<em>What\u2014?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Chat Noir took several steps back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou <em>so</em> did!\u201d Marinette yelled, following him. \u201cDo\u2026 do we know each other?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat? Why would you say that?!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>Oh!</em> Do you know who I am?!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI can\u2019t imagine\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow did you find out?! I\u2019ve been so careful, and I\u2019ve told you over and over\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d Chat Noir yelped, hating how shrill his voice was. \u201cI have zero knowledge about anything at all and that includes what\u2019s going on right now!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cListen, you little <em>cat</em>, you tell me right now\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Well, I\u2019m almost out of time, have to go, see you later, bye!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Chat Noir leapt across the rooftops of Paris to the echo of Ladybug shouting, \u201c<em>You goddamn feline!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When he was sure she wasn\u2019t following him, he let himself settle behind a chimney on one of his favorite buildings. He gritted his teeth and glared up into the night sky. \u201cWell, that was stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>So. I basically just told Ladybug I know who she is.\u00a0</em><em>And that we know each other.\u00a0</em>Chat Noir pinched the bridge of his nose. <em>And that she acts differently around me when we\u2019re not superheroes.</em> \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I just leave a trail of breadcrumbs to my front door while I was at it?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladybug \u2014 Marinette \u2014 was smart. She would figure this out. And when she did, then what? How would Ladybug act around Chat Noir then? Would she freeze up like Marinette did around Adrien? That\u2026 would not be cool. Wouldn\u2019t be fun, and it would make working together a hell of a lot harder. Plus\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAugh.\u201d He leaned his head back against the chimney with a groan. \u201cLadybug.\u201d She was beautiful and graceful and funny and smart, and he still hadn\u2019t quite given up hope that someday <em>someday</em> she\u2019d think something like that about him. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But now she was Marinette as well. Who was nice, like he\u2019d told Plagg, but\u2026 he just didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if Ladybug started acting like Marinette. What if the problem was Adrien? What if\u2026 what if Ladybug just <em>couldn\u2019t be around Adrien?\u00a0</em>Chat Noir frowned up at the sky. <em>Well, then.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marinette was going to learn how to talk to Adrien.\u00a0And together, Adrien and Chat Noir would be excellent teachers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Probably.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNino.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMmf?\u201d His friend looked up at him over his sandwich. They had managed to shake off Chloe and Sabrina for lunch and were currently hiding/not hiding in the school\u2019s tiny garden square.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow do you get a girl to talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nino choked and swallowed quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re asking <em>me</em> this question?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien frowned. \u201cYou can talk to everyone. Why wouldn\u2019t I ask you?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDude, have you listened to me? Do you hear the things that come out of my mouth?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBut that\u2019s why you\u2019re great,\u201d Adrien insisted. \u201cYou just say whatever, and people just say whatever back. How do you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nino stared at him. \u201cYou are \u2014 and I use the word \u2018literally\u2019 unironically here \u2014 <em>literally</em> a model. What makes you think you have to do anything to get a girl to talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOkay, well, what if that\u2019s part of the problem?\u201d Adrien had given this some thought last night and had come up with a few theories. \u201cWhat if, say, it\u2019s hard for people to talk to me? Shouldn\u2019t I be even better at getting them to open up?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c... As much as I\u2019d really like to be offended at how easily you latched onto that idea, you might have a point.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien sat up straight. \u201cYou think that\u2019s really it? You think people might not talk to me because I\u2019m a model?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOr because you\u2019re rich. Or the son of a powerful designer. Or super smart. I mean, pick whichever incredibly intimidating attribute you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWell, now, you\u2019re just making it sound like no one can talk to me at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot true, man, not true.\u201d Nino patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI talk to you all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThank you. Which is why I\u2019m asking you <em>how</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nino raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow can I talk to you? Well, in addition to all that other stuff I mentioned, you\u2019re kind of a huge dork.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c... What?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHuge.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou just finished telling me I\u2019m basically the golden child of Paris, and now you\u2019re saying I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNever said you were an idiot. You\u2019re just not as cool as your resume would suggest you should be.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAh.\u201d Adrien slumped back onto the grass. \u201cWell. What a relief. I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, come on, man, you know what I mean, right? You\u2019re just... \u201c Nino gestured with the remains of his sandwich. \u201cYou\u2019re just like everyone else, yeah? You don\u2019t actually care about all that other stuff. I mean, you care about all the stuff you\u2019re studying, I guess. You seem to like the fencing and extra language classes, which, whatever. But you\u2019re not going around saying, \u2018Check out my dad\u2019s spring line, this jacket cost blah di blah\u2019 and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear jackets <em>around</em> that cost blah di blah,\u201d Adrien said defensively. \u201cAnd what does that have to do with getting a girl to talk to me?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOkay, are we talking about a particular girl?\u201d Nino asked. \u201cBecause the only one I\u2019ve actually noticed who can\u2019t talk to you is\u2026 oh. <em>Oh.</em>\u201d He eyed Adrien sharply. \u201cDo you have a thing for <em>Marinette?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>No</em>, I do not have a <em>thing</em> for Marinette!\u201d Adrien hissed. \u201cHowever, I <em>am</em> concerned that she can\u2019t even say hello to me!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat <em>concerns</em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird, okay?\u201d Adrien said. <em>No details. Don\u2019t give anything away.</em> \u201cAnd I guess I\u2026 well, like you said, people usually just talk to me, and I don\u2019t have to work too hard at it. Seems like a skill I should learn, you know, being in the fashion industry and all.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d Nino still looked suspicious. \u201cSo\u2026 getting Marinette to talk to you, huh? Like a normal person?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cJust leading her through a two-minute conversation, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d <em>For now.</em> They could work up to\u2026 joking or something eventually.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHuh. Well, okay.\u201d Nino stuffed the last of his sandwich in his mouth. \u201cFirst, you gotta make her comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. How do I do that?\u201d Because it was painfully obvious that, for whatever reason, Marinette was not at all comfortable around Adrien. <em>So what makes Ladybug cool with Chat Noir?</em> \u201cPuns?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cPuns?\u201d Nino looked at him like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201c... No, man. God, have you ever been on a date?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHey, now, I\u2019m not trying to date Marinette,\u201d Adrien clarified hastily.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOkay, but the principles of conversation are the same. You have to be confident, and you have to make her feel confident too.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh.\u201d Adrien wondered if he should be taking notes. <em>Principles of conversation?</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSo\u2026 start with easy stuff. Like, how did she do on the last test?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, I tried that one,\u201d Adrien recalled. \u201cShe still freaked out.\u201d But it was still the longest conversation he\u2019d had with her, now that he thought of it. \u201cI guess I could try again.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nino nodded sagely. \u201cThis could take time. You have to be patient. And when she freaks out, you have to act like it\u2019s no big deal. Remember, it\u2019s all about making her feel comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAnd confident,\u201d Adrien repeated. <em>Weird.</em> Ladybug positively oozed with confidence. You could shatter rocks on her self-assuredness. Chat Noir was the goofball she rolled her eyes at. But apparently that\u2019s not how it was going to work with Marinette and Adrien.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRight. Help her feel good about herself when she\u2019s talking to you, and she\u2019ll probably keep talking to you.\u201d Nino paused. \u201cOr I guess in this case, she might actually start talking to you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRight. Okay, right.\u201d Adrien nodded. \u201cYeah! I can do this!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYeah! Good luck, man!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI cannot do this.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien dropped into his computer chair with a groan. Plagg flew out of his schoolbag, snickering unkindly. \u201cI have never seen a girl actually hide in the bathroom like that before,\u201d the little cat spirit jeered.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow can I get her comfortable with me if she won\u2019t even let me stand within five feet of her?\u201d Adrien sighed, exasperated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After literature, Marinette had managed to agree that she was glad they weren\u2019t reading the entirety of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo.\u00a0</em>After world history, Marinette had blushed \u2014 <em>hard</em> \u2014 and shrugged a shoulder when he had suggested that the Louvre\u2019s new Egyptian antiquities collection might be interesting.\u00a0And finally, after business ethics, he had attempted to ask her if she\u2019d had a chance to try the new cafe down the street, but she\u2019d literally fled to the restroom as soon as the bell rang. As far as he knew, she was still there.\u00a0Except, probably not, because he was gone now.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien smirked humorlessly at the bank of monitors across his desk. Ladybug smiled back at him from each one.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d he asked her. \u201cHow can you roll your eyes at Chat Noir and not even look at Adrien Agreste?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien woke up to the tiniest pokes on his cheek. He swatted, sleepily felt something connect with his hand, and rolled back over.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, he looks really alert.\u201d The voice was new. And sarcastic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAnd I suppose Ladybug jumps right out of bed when you wake her up at 3 a.m. on a school night? Help me out of the trash can.\u201d That was definitely Plagg.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Ladybug?</em> Adrien\u2019s eyes flew open, and he sat up quickly. A tiny red blob, about the size of an apple, hovered over the trash can by his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201c... Plagg? Did you fall in some paint or something?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWell!\u201d The red blob put small hands on nonexistent hips. \u201cThe idea!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTikki.\u201d Plagg\u2019s voice was muffled. \u201cIn a moment? I\u2019m stuck in a coffee cup.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTikki. <em>Tikki?!</em>\u201d Adrien threw back the covers and rushed over to his desk. \u201cYou\u2019re Ladybug\u2019s kwami?! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally meeting you, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cStop!\u201d The little red spirit held up a hand. \u201cLadybug wants to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien felt his blood drain to his feet. \u201cShe\u2026 she does?\u201d he squeaked. <em>Oh. Oh yeah.</em> Last night seemed like a really long time ago, but Ladybug probably hadn\u2019t forgotten the moment when Chat Noir had revealed that he knew who she was. Like an idiot.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIndeed.\u201d Tikki crossed her arms. It was an experience, being glared at by a mystical creature the size of a chibi anime figurine. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting in the park. Suit up.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien stumbled back a step. Small wonder now that Ladybug was so intimidating herself sometimes. \u201cEr\u2026 yes? I\u2019ll just \u2014 find Plagg.\u201d He knelt to rummage in the trash. His hand had just closed on the tiny black spirit when a thought struck him. \u201cHey, wait a sec. You said that you and Tikki don\u2019t share identities with each other until after Chat Noir and Ladybug figure it out for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTrue in every respect!\u201d Plagg gasped, trying to free himself from Adrien\u2019s grip.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBut Ladybug doesn\u2019t know who I am yet,\u201d Adrien insisted. \u201cSo what\u2019s she doing in my room?\u201d He pointed at Tikki.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNow don\u2019t blame your silly kwami.\u201d Tikki floated over to them. \u201cHe\u2019s rubbish at keeping secrets. When I decide I want to know, I usually find out. And Ladybug is<em> upset</em>,\u201d she emphasized, glaring at Adrien again.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIs\u2026 is she?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cA bit,\u201d Tikki confirmed. \u201cI suggest you hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ladybug, it seemed, was in fact upset.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir cowered behind the park\u2019s gate. Ladybug was pacing in front of the fountain, muttering to herself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Well, now what?</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If this was just Ladybug and Chat Noir as usual, he knew what he\u2019d do. He\u2019d strut out there, flirting and confident of being shut down as sexily as always. If it was Marinette and Adrien, he\u2019d do his model walk, oozing confidence and waiting for her to devolve into a pile of stammering mush.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even when it had been Chat Noir and Marinette that one time, he\u2019d acted like Chat Noir always did. Marinette had seemed a bit more put together than usual, but nothing on par with Ladybug. Not that he could recall anyway.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He had no idea what to do with this combination: super-confident Ladybug/melt-into-the-floor Marinette with Chat Noir. Also, she was angry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir swallowed hard. <em>When in doubt, wing it.</em> He stepped around the gate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYour knight in shining armor returns, milady.\u201d<em> Would Chat Noir bow right now? He would\u2026 but would Adrien be like that with Marinette? Ha! Right. Okay, so, what do I\u2014?</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladybug\u2019s yo-yo was wrapped around him before he could make up his mind one way or the other. He gave a decidedly unmanly yelp and probably would have face-planted if she hadn\u2019t jammed a hand into his shoulder. Kind of hard.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNo running away this time, kitty cat,\u201d Ladybug snarled quietly, keeping the yo-yo string taut. \u201cDo you know who I am? Yes or no?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir bit his lip and looked down into narrow blue eyes. <em>Lie! You could just lie. You could say a totally wrong name, and she\u2019d never know.</em> \u201cYou\u2019re Marinette. Marinette Dupain-Cheng,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transformation was mesmerizing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The blue eyes behind the red mask widened, black lashes fanning around her surprise. Her mouth fell open ever so slightly, and then she blushed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir stopped breathing. He\u2019d never seen Ladybug like this before, but it was a look that Adrien was pretty damn familiar with.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat \u2014 what do you mean?\u201d She tightened her grip on the yo-yo string, but her voice was soft. \u201cYou know Marinette?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI don\u2019t, though.\u201d Chat Noir tugged at the string, and he felt it loosen around his shoulders. He swept it off one shoulder and then the next, letting it fall to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know Marinette at all.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh. Oh, I see.\u201d Ladybug recoiled the yo-yo and didn\u2019t look at him. Chat Noir hated that Adrien was familiar with that too. Ladybug should always be able to look at him. \u201cSo\u2026 we don\u2019t actually know each other,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He shrugged. \u201cI have no idea how well you know me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked up at him then, her brows drawn quizzically. \u201cWhat on earth does that mean? I know you or I don\u2019t, which is it?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUm?\u201d Chat Noir rubbed the back of his neck and looked up into the street lights for some kind of guidance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou said that I don\u2019t act the same,\u201d Ladybug said suddenly, her voice a bit more firm. \u201cI remember that.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Shit.</em> \u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 true,\u201d he agreed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUgh.\u201d Ladybug threw up her hands and walked away from him. \u201cAre you as frustrating as this when we\u2019re around each other?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir thought back to how Marinette had hidden from him in the bathroom today. He laughed. \u201cI think\u2026 maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladybug shot him a glance over her shoulder. \u201cNaturally. So if you\u2019re the same, what do I do that\u2019s different?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUh?\u201d Chat Noir put a hand to his mouth thoughtfully. I<em> can\u2019t very well tell you that you\u2019re a complete weirdo around me.</em> \u201cYou\u2019re a little more\u2026 quiet?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her eyes narrowed. \u201cQuiet. Anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou know,\u201d he backpedaled, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to tell you too much because\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBecause what?\u201d She walked back to him. \u201cI\u2019ll find out who you are? Oh no. It\u2019s almost like you think our identities <em>should have been kept a secret.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHey!\u201d Chat Noir protested. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you weren\u2019t more careful.\u201d The half truth pricked at him but not enough to take it back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCareful?!\u201d Ladybug screeched. \u201cI have been the epitome of careful, you stalker!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI am nothing of the kind!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow did you find out who I was?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2014!\u201d Chat Noir paused. <em>I changed course to check out my new ad. Yeah, no.</em> \u201cYou transformed on the wrong side of a kiosk. After a fight. The end.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladybug raised an eyebrow, dissatisfied. \u201cThat\u2019s not even a good story.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhich usually means it\u2019s true. Sorry it wasn\u2019t as romantic as you\u2019d always imagined, princess,\u201d he added lightly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>You\u2014!</em> You\u2019re the one who\u2019s always flirting around!\u201d She eyed him suspiciously. \u201cDo you flirt with me in real life too?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir tried to cover up a choke. \u201cWho\u2019s to say which part is real life, mademoiselle?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladybug smacked his arm. \u201cDo you or do you not flirt with Marinette, you shameless pile?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir stared down at her. Flirt with Marinette? As Adrien? The concept was\u2026 new and a little bit weird but\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Large blue eyes met his, and a delicate pink mouth smiled at him a little bit. <em>Ladybug.</em> Damn, but she could make it kind of hard to breathe.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chat Noir swallowed gently. He licked his lips. \u201cThat could\u2026 be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adrien watched his alarm clock tick over to 4 a.m. If his dad ever found out how late he stayed up sometimes\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plagg snuggled into his usual nest in Adrien\u2019s schoolbag. \u201cWell, that could have gone infinitely worse,\u201d the black spirit said with a yawn. \u201cWe should celebrate with a luxurious two hours of sleep. I swear, Tikki, sometimes\u2026\u201d The mutters faded into gentle, tiny snores.</p>\n<p>Sleep tugged at Adrien\u2019s eyes, but his mind wasn\u2019t interested in the idea. Or not yet at least. First, it wanted to thoroughly analyze all the things that could go horribly wrong with flirting with Marinette Dupain-Cheng.<b> </b></p>\n<p>The first step was, obviously, to be casual.</p>\n<p>Adrien studied himself in the mirror. He didn\u2019t look casual. He looked wound up tighter than Ladybug\u2019s yo-yo.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t exactly hiding in the men\u2019s room before his first class. Not really. He just\u2026 well, if you were going to intentionally <em> flirt </em>for the very first time, you should probably make sure you didn\u2019t have, like, granola in your teeth, right?</p>\n<p>Nino\u2019s advice played over in his mind. <em> You\u2019ve got to make her feel confident. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Confident.\u201d Adrien nodded his head firmly. Then he groaned. \u201cWhy is flirting with Ladybug something that just <em> happens? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe because Ladybug is already confident?\u201d Plagg poked his head out of Adrien\u2019s schoolbag. \u201cShe hardly needs you to swaddle her in praise. The pressure is off, you might say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette <em> is </em>Ladybug.\u201d Adrien wondered if he repeated that often enough he might\u00a0actually believe it someday. \u201cThat has to be part of her outside the costume too, right? Somewhere? Buried quite deeply perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg squinted neon green eyes at him. \u201c<em>Quite </em>deeply. Tikki seems to have found a particularly dichotomous young lady this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien swallowed hard and glanced at his phone. \u201cYeah. Well, duty calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFeel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Plagg whispered from inside the bag as Adrien pushed open the bathroom door. \u201cBut the effect is probably not going to be very flirtatious if you\u2019re treating the whole thing like a <em> chore</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going into battle, Plagg,\u201d Adrien hissed. The halls were fairly deserted \u2014 he was the only one cutting it so close to get to class. \u201cFor Ladybug, for me, and\u2026 for the way Marinette said \u2018okay\u2019 that one time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSh!\u201d Adrien rounded the corner, his classroom coming into view. And there she was.</p>\n<p>Marinette paused in front of the door, fiddling with something in her little clasp purse.</p>\n<p>Adrien slowed his steps. In this unguarded moment\u2026 if he tried very hard\u2026 he could <em> just </em>see Ladybug. Which made it easier than it should have been to say\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> so </em>happy you\u2019re late too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s shriek made his eyes roll back into his head. \u201c<em> A-Adrien?! </em> \u201d She clutched the bag to her as though he\u2019d seen her drop a joint into it. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not really <em> late </em> I was just\u2026 and then I had to \u2014 well, there was this <em> thing </em>and then\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien finally remembered to close his mouth. <em> Make her comfortable. </em> How, exactly? Marinette was all but\u00a0 <em> vibrating. </em>\u201cNo worries, right? We\u2019ll just walk in together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her pupils constricted to pinpoints. \u201cTo\u2026 to<em>gether? </em>\u201d she hissed.</p>\n<p>How exactly was flirting going to happen if he couldn\u2019t even be <em> boring </em>without making her fall apart? Who knew someone could be so shy? Adrien kept his smile in place. \u201cThat way no one has to take the heat alone, yeah? I\u2019ll go first.\u201d He reached past her to push open the door.</p>\n<p>His arm brushed her jacket sleeve, and he heard her\u00a0suck in a breath. Adrien\u00a0glanced down to see her gripping\u00a0her shoulder. \u201cOh, sorry. Did I hurt you?\u201d <em> How would I have? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cN-no,\u201d she breathed, staring at him. \u201cJust\u2026 just go on ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d That was a normal sentence! With hardly a stutter! Adrien celebrated with a wink. \u201cEnjoy the view.\u201d</p>\n<p>He walked into the classroom, feeling pretty damn good about himself to be honest. He was all but certain he had just managed to accomplish actual flirting. Without the black leather and cat ears! Maybe this whole thing could be as much about him being more like Chat Noir as it would be about Ladybug being \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Their history instructor was staring past him, horrified, into the hall. Adrien raised his eyebrows. The entire class, or the students in the front rows at least, were craning their necks to see through the door.</p>\n<p>Adrien turned slowly.</p>\n<p>Marinette was sitting on her ass in the doorway. One hand clutched the doorframe, the other braced against the floor. Her bookbag had slipped off her shoulder, her legs akimbo. Her cheeks were pinker than her cherry-blossom-colored pants, and her mouth gaped.\u00a0The instructor rushed over to help her up, and Alya slipped out of her seat, clucking her tongue at her clumsy friend.</p>\n<p>Adrien turned his head just enough to find Nino.</p>\n<p>Who was watching him. And shaking his head slowly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, what did you <em> do? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, <em> what did I do? </em> \u201d Adrien stabbed the peach on his school lunch tray viciously. \u201cI said, oh, you\u2019re late too? Let me go through the door first.\u201d He was absolutely <em> not </em>going to tell Nino about the \u2018enjoy the view\u2019 comment. Damn, and he had thought that one was inspired too.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then she <em> fell.</em>\u201d Nino raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I turned around, and she was sitting on the floor! <em> And </em> she wouldn\u2019t even look at me after class!\u201d Hours later, and here Adrien was back to square one. Lunch with Nino and asking for advice. <em> Maybe it was a dumb line. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you still want to get her to talk to you?\u201d Nino asked. \u201cYou might just want to give this one up and move on.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s head snapped up in horror. \u201cAre you kidding me? I haven\u2019t even flirted with her yet! Properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d Nino cocked his head. \u201cYou decided getting Marinette to have a normal conversation with you wasn\u2019t enough of a challenge, so now you want to try <em> flirting </em> with her.\u201d He frowned. \u201cFlirting is advanced communication, man.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this because she\u2019s, like, a <em> challenge </em> or something,\u201d Adrien said quickly. \u201cI mean, she <em> is</em>, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Nino looked at him with something weirdly like respect. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you had a thing for Marinette, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014!\u201d Adrien stopped. <em> I have a thing for Ladybug. Which means\u2026 I have a thing for Marinette?! </em>\u201cIt\u2019s new,\u201d he managed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be. Cuz yesterday you were all \u2018I\u2019m not trying to date Marinette, stop putting words in my mouth,\u2019\u201d Nino reminded him reproachfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Well,\u201d Adrien stammered. \u201cThat\u2019s still, you know, <em> really </em>far ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino narrowed his eyes and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re so right. Which is why we gotta get this moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... We?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Uh. Hi, Alya.\u201d Adrien greeted his\u00a0curvy classmate\u00a0as naturally as he could manage. He knew she was Marinette\u2019s best friend, which meant he <em> also </em>knew that Nino was definitely making this more elaborate than it needed to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d Alya always seemed to be super high-energy. \u201cNino said you guys wanted to check out the Dupains\u2019 new macarons, and I was like, I\u2019m coming!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs\u2026 is that what we\u2019re doing?\u201d Adrien glanced at Nino. The three of them walked down the school steps as the last students left in the fading afternoon light.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Nino punched his arm a little harder than necessary. \u201cYou <em> know </em>I know how much you like sea salt caramel! I am not about to let you miss out on an experience like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Right.\u201d Adrien wracked his brain as to when he\u2019d ever gotten worked up about sea salt caramel. Sweets weren\u2019t something he came into regular contact with.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys paid that much attention to the daily flavors,\u201d Alya commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nino laid a hand on his heart and gazed heavenward. \u201cWe check online every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien shot him a look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too!\u201d Alya jumped up and down a little bit. \u201cI can\u2019t always go. They\u2019re not cheap, you know. But when you said you were going, well, <em> yeah</em>, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. How expensive are they?\u201d Adrien asked nervously. He had some cash from his last paycheck, but he definitely didn\u2019t want Nino to have to shell out anything serious for a stupid experiment like this.</p>\n<p>Alya cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never actually gotten them before?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Shit! I just blew Nino\u2019s whole story! </em>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino threw an arm over his shoulder. \u201cAlya, would you believe it, this guy has never actually been.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alya stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never gone to the Dupains\u2019 bakery? Like, <em> ever? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Adrien licked his lips. \u201cYou see\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s afraid Marinette will think he\u2019s just going to check her out,\u201d Nino interrupted breezily. \u201cWhat a dumb thing to be worried about, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya\u2019s eyebrows shot into her hairline. \u201cTotally. Totally dumb. Ohmigod, Adrien, <em> do you have a crush on Marinette?! </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAugh!\u201d Adrien shoved Nino\u2019s arm off his shoulder. \u201c<em>Nino! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> DO?! </em>OHmigod ohmigod, Marinette is going to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa.\u201d Nino, calm as ever, held up both hands. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Alya. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that your friend gets a little\u2026 timid\u2026 around our favorite model here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya squinted at him. She turned to face forward. She coughed. \u201cWell. If you put it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you feel me.\u201d Nino put a hand to his chest. \u201cAdrien has avoided the Dupains\u2019 shop, at the cost of enjoying daily macarons, simply to keep poor Marinette from spontaneously combusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien <em> just </em>stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Who would believe such a stupid story?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m elated, Alya, that you\u2019re coming along.\u201d Nino slapped Adrien on the back. \u201cI\u2019ll keep Adrien from eating the contents of the entire store. And you\u2014\u201d He rested a hand lightly on Alya\u2019s shoulder. Adrien totally saw and narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou will reassure Marinette with your calming presence that Adrien is nothing to be scared of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Alya didn\u2019t look at them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cIt\u2019s <em> that </em>hard for Marinette to be around me?\u201d This was already not going well.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alya said suddenly. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not scared of you, I promise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I <em> hope </em>not,\u201d Adrien said. \u201cGeez, I just thought she was super shy. And she just decided I was\u2026 the one person she couldn\u2019t talk to? Like, at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya pursed her lips. \u201cSo you\u2019ve noticed?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNoticed?!\u201d Adrien threw his arms in the air. \u201cShe fell on the <em> floor </em>this morning after I said hello!\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya\u2019s expression changed instantly from horror to the flattest look he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThat is <em> not </em>what you said.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh. </em>Adrien caught her eye. Right. Of course Marinette would have told her\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait, what?\u201d Nino cocked his head. \u201c<em>What did you really say? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em> said, </em>and I\u00a0quote, \u2018Enjoy the view.\u2019 End quote. As he was walking through the classroom door <em> in front of her. </em>\u201d Alya looked very smug.</p>\n<p>Nino whipped\u00a0his head\u00a0around to stare at Adrien. \u201cYou <em> animal! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien groaned again. Louder. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that! \u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Alya stepped in front of him, forcing him to stop walking. \u201cOh, tell me what it\u2019s like. You are either into my girl, or you are taking advantage of the fact that she is into <em> you </em> because it gives you some kinda thrill. And if it\u2019s the second one, I will own your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s and Nino\u2019s jaws dropped simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Alya\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cOops.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oops?! </em>\u201d Nino shrieked. \u201cOops?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien was vaguely concerned he\u2019d never be able to shut his mouth again. <em> What. WHAT? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNow, hey, guys.\u201d Alya backed up a step. \u201cThis is all just\u2026 just hypothetical, right? Let\u2019s go get macarons, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no, no.\u201d Nino grabbed both of her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s take that one more time from the top. <em> Your girl, </em> as you put it, is into our little man right here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Alya squealed, pulling at her hands. \u201cI just want to get sea salt caramel macarons and forget that anyone likes anyone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> traitor! </em>\u201d Nino shouted gleefully. \u201cAdrien! The world is ours! Adrien?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien had discovered that the world looked decidedly less bizarre when he was crouched closer to the sidewalk with his hands grabbing his\u00a0hair. <em>Holy shit! </em>Goddammit, this is <em>not </em>how he imagined he would feel if he ever found out that Ladybug liked him back. Maybe butterflies but not complete and utter panic! He now had all the power to ruin absolutely everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAdrien?\u201d Alya squatted in front of him and put a hand on his head. \u201cYou\u2019re, uh, looking a little paler than usual there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mouth felt like he\u2019d eaten cotton balls for a week. \u201cIs\u2026\u201d His voice sounded awful. \u201cIs Marinette going to be at the bakery?\u201d</p>\n<p>She bit her lip. Nodded slowly. \u201cYeah. She usually helps out on Fridays. No school the next day, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien swallowed hard. He looked up at Nino.</p>\n<p>His friend shrugged and shook his head. \u201cUp to you, man, but\u2026 it\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re going, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya half-turned to glare up at him. \u201cYou said you just checked the daily flavors. You said sea salt caramel was his favorite. That\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino crossed his arms. \u201cYeah, well, just because some of us\u00a0are better at keeping their friends\u2019 secrets than you are\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou both suck at keeping secrets.\u201d Adrien heaved himself to his feet. He straightened his bookbag over his shoulder. Tugged at his lapels. And started walking forward. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt\u2026 not good but certainly okay. Hey, Marinette could have <em> hated </em> him, right? He may have even less of a clue about how to interact with her now, but things could absolutely, definitely be worse than Ladybug/Marinette liking him.</p>\n<p><em> Yeah. </em>He lifted his chin. Feeling pretty good.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Adrien?\u201d Alya\u2019s voice cut into his thoughts. \u201cWe needed to turn at that corner back there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t catch sight of them right away.</p>\n<p>She was helping a woman and her little girl select a variety of tiny cakes from one of the glass cases. Adrien cocked his head. She had on a pink apron. And a really, <em> really </em>cute smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>Nino patted him on the shoulder. Alya swept past them into the shop. \u201cJust act casual,\u201d she hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlya!\u201d A pretty woman with Marinette\u2019s blue-black hair wiped her hands on her apron and walked up to them. \u201cAre you here to see Marinette?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Madame Cheng.\u201d Alya smiled winningly. \u201cYeah, sure, when she\u2019s got a minute, but actually\u2026\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cDo you have any of your daily macarons left?\u201d</p>\n<p>A pleased smirk settled over Madame Cheng\u2019s face. \u201cWell, you know, I just so happen to have one more tray in the kitchen. Can I bring some out for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Alya gripped her hands under her chin. \u201cOh\u2026 oh, I just\u2026 need one. Um.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh. </em> Alya had said they were kind of pricey. Well. He and Nino <em> had </em>kind of involved her unfairly. \u201cActually, we\u2019ll take half a dozen if you\u2019ve got them,\u201d Adrien said, walking up behind her. Nino followed, eyeballing the pastry cases on the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Madame Cheng straightened, looking up at him with wide eyes. \u201cOh, Alya, your boyfriend is <em> adorable. </em>Half a dozen, what a gentleman!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Augh! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Madame Cheng put a hand to her mouth. \u201cUm. Well.\u201d She smiled brightly. \u201cWhat a nice\u2026 friend. I\u2019ll just\u2026 just go get them, shall I? Half a dozen of the daily flavor, yes.\u201d She disappeared into the depths of the shop.</p>\n<p>Alya, Adrien, and Nino exchanged glances, a little shaken.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s heart stopped momentarily before it tried to claw its way out of his chest entirely. Marinette had finished with her customer and was staring at them \u2014 at him \u2014 as though they\u2019d just announced their plan to rob the place.</p>\n<p>\u201cNino!\u201d Alya grabbed the other boy\u2019s hand. \u201cDid you see these wedding cakes in the front window? They\u2019re incredible!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... <em> wedding </em> cakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien fought down panic as Alya and Nino bolted to the front of the shop. He glanced back at Marinette out of the corner of his eye. She was gripping the glass countertop with white knuckles, her mouth open, her eyes like saucers.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Well, shit. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He squared his shoulders. As much as he may not wish to be just like his dad in every respect, the man certainly knew how to at least <em> look </em>in control. Chin up, model walk, and \u2014 for that special Adrien flare \u2014 an attempt at a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Adrien?\u201d Marinette\u2019s voice was little more than a whisper. She put a hand to her chest, and Adrien began to die.</p>\n<p>Ladybug was looking at him like <em> that. </em> This was\u2026 well, if Alya was right\u2026 <em> and she might not be</em>, he reminded himself\u2026 then maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s getting us some macarons,\u201d he said suavely, leaning against the counter. And promptly wanted to smash his face into the glass. <em> That\u2019s your opening line, really, Agreste? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIs\u2026 is she?\u201d Marinette breathed. She stood like she was wrapped in rubber bands, all tight and tense and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>He swallowed hard. <em> C\u2019mon, Ladybug, it\u2019s me. </em> \u201cSea salt caramel was the flavor today, I heard.\u201d <em> Good god, how is talking this hard? </em></p>\n<p>But a couple of the rubber bands seemed to loosen. Marinette shifted a little onto one foot. \u201cMm. They\u2019re always popular.\u201d She paused and then, bravely: \u201cDo \u2014 do you like sea salt caramel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re my favorite, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... Apparently?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh!\u201d Adrien\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI <em> think </em> I\u2019ll like them. I\u2019m sure I will. Ha, how could I not?\u201d He coughed. \u201cI mean. Nino said I had to try them.\u201d <em> GodDAMMIT. </em>He glanced over his shoulder. Nino and Alya were watching them from behind an Eiffel tower of cupcakes. As one, they whipped their heads back to stare deeply at elaborate frosting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve <em> never </em>had them before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien turned back to Marinette, and his heart tried to climb up his throat. She looked positively floored. \u201cUm! Well, I\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve never had <em> your </em> macarons before. I mean! Your dad\u2019s! Your mom\u2019s? <em> Whoever </em>makes them. Here. I\u2019ve never had macarons from here before.\u201d He blew out a breath.</p>\n<p>Marinette stared at him. Which wasn\u2019t unusual in itself. Except normally she stared at him like he was about to eat her. <em> Now </em>she was staring at him like he\u2019d grown a second head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdrien.\u201d Her voice was firm. And so like Ladybug that Adrien felt himself melt against the counter a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are telling me that you\u2019ve <em> never </em>had a macaron from our shop?\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cHave you ever even been here before?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Shit. </em>\u201cUm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d She folded her arms across her pink apron, and the whole effect was <em> augh. </em></p>\n<p>He leaned forward. \u201cHey. In my defense, I had one of those croissants your dad brought into class once.\u201d</p>\n<p>She put a hand firmly on the counter and another on her hip. \u201cThat is deplorable. What\u2019s your favorite flavor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien raised an eyebrow. \u201cSea salt\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite flavor, <em> really</em>. Nino\u2019s opinion notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was really close. With no mask, those big blue eyes were just\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a hard question.\u201d Marinette tapped her fingers on the counter.</p>\n<p>Something deep inside shivered at that very <em> Ladybug </em>tone. But. Now he kind of wanted to see blushy Marinette again. Not the one who was constantly panicked. The one who was just sort of\u2026 cutely overawed. He straightened and watched as her eyes followed him up. It was weirdly satisfying.</p>\n<p>\u201cLavender,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI know I like lavender.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette looked at him appraisingly. \u201cOh? Not a usual favorite of high-school boys.\u201d She pushed away from the counter and walked down the line of pastry cases.</p>\n<p>Adrien followed. \u201cBut you admit that I\u2019m not a usual high-school boy.\u201d This was fun. Sort of like Chat Noir with Ladybug but with\u2026 more at stake.</p>\n<p>Marinette glanced up at him as she opened the back of a case. \u201cI will admit that you are unusual.\u201d She hid her face behind the counter, but Adrien could still see her ears. He bit his lip. They were bright pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can work with that.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the smile out of his voice, even though he knew it was less than cool.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d Marinette stood. She didn\u2019t look at him as she placed a tiny sweet on a napkin. \u201cTry that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face was every bit as pink as her ears. Adrien didn\u2019t give a damn about the sweet, but he was afraid if he didn\u2019t at least look at it he\u2019d stare at <em> her </em>too long.</p>\n<p>It was the smallest square cake he\u2019d ever seen, palest purple, with a little white flower in some kind of frosting on top. He\u2019d never seen anything so perfect looking outside of a photoshoot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, Marinette.\u201d Adrien picked it up but simply held it. <em> Look at me. Please. </em>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her blush was fierce, but <em> thank god</em>, she didn\u2019t start shaking again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I know the owners.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed and bit off a corner of the small cake. <em> Oh. Oh, wow. </em>In the middle of winter, here was spring lavender. Not overly sweet, just a little grassy, and that clean, clean scent\u2026 \u201cWow,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p>Marinette tucked her hair behind her ear, a pleased smile on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing we have right now that\u2019s lavender. Most people want, like, dark chocolate and caramel and coffee in the winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad <em> made </em> this?\u201d Adrien instantly wished he could take that back. This was the man\u2019s bakery. <em> Of course </em>he made it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s not a fashion empire, but we make it work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s head snapped up. Marinette was watching him, biting back a grin. Here was Ladybug without the mask, with her sparkling blue eyes and her sweet sass and just a little bit of something new and curious that was so entirely Marinette Dupain-Cheng it was maddening.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien heard the words sail out of his mouth. Unplanned, unbidden, and undeniably stupid.</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s smile evaporated. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Just, you know, like, once,\u201d Adrien babbled, \u201cjust to see, kind of, I mean, wow, who would want to monopolize their entire \u2014 like, we could just hang out some night after school or something, see if we \u2014 oh, crap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette wasn\u2019t listening. She couldn't be.\u00a0She looked a million, <em> ten million, </em>miles away, she looked on the moon, and not in the overjoyed sense. Her mouth was open, her eyes staring at nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly \u2014 you know, uh.\u201d Adrien rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThat clearly wasn\u2019t \u2014 you can just \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYES!\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien stumbled back from the counter a couple steps. Marinette hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. She stood straight as a board, her mouth in a grim line.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry?\u201d he stammered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I mean, yes, definitely, let\u2019s\u2026 let\u2019s do that. Thing.\u201d She swallowed hard.</p>\n<p>Adrien figured he should be feeling something a little bit more like elation. Ladybug had just <em> agreed </em> to go out with him. Or go one one date with him. Something like that. She had just agreed to <em> something</em>, and now all he could think of was\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em> Now what? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Well, okay, cool.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cUhhh.\u201d <em> Shit. How do you date? What should I say? What is a dating THING? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Marinette coughed and cleared her throat. \u201cMaybe I should get your\u2026 your number? Or your email address?\u201d</p>\n<p>Now it was Adrien\u2019s turn to blush. <em> Right. Right, that\u2019s good. Ohmigod ohmigod, Ladybug just asked for my NUMBER. </em>\u201cAha. Sure. That would make sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette reached into her back pocket. \u201cUm. Just\u2026 if you want\u2026\u201d She handed him her phone.</p>\n<p>Adrien experienced a brief moment of terror when he couldn\u2019t remember his phone number <em> at all, </em>but thankfully it was short lived. He threw in his email for good measure. \u201cWell, um. Text me or\u2026 or call me. And we can figure out\u2026 something.\u201d He made sure not to touch her hand as he returned her phone. Not that he hadn\u2019t touched Ladybug before, but there was no doubt a limit to how much he could deal with today. It was probably close, to be honest.</p>\n<p>Marinette gave him the tiniest smile. She clutched her phone to her chest. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>He <em> had </em>to leave.</p>\n<p>Adrien tapped the counter. Tried to keep his grin from shattering his face. Or vomiting on the floor. Or <em> whatever </em>was going to happen from happening. \u201cRight. Cool.\u201d He turned quickly.</p>\n<p>Nino, Alya, and Madame Cheng stood together on the other side of the shop. Nino had his hat clenched in his hands, Alya had her phone out, and Madame Cheng held a small white box. Her grin was <em> enormous. </em></p>\n<p>Adrien walked to them, hoping he looked normal. Except who knew what normal looked like? Not Adrien.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice work, Agreste,\u201d Nino whispered, punching him softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you could do it,\u201d Alya said, quiet and fierce.</p>\n<p>Madame Cheng shoved the box into his hands. \u201cOn the house!\u201d she choked, her smile a bit teary.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adrien took the box. \u201cI can\u2019t \u2014 let me just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says thank you, Madame!\u201d Alya sang and looped her arm through his. \u201cBye, Marinette! I want details!\u201d she hissed, which Adrien thought was kind of silly since he was right next to her.</p>\n<p>She and Nino dragged him effortlessly through the bakery\u2019s front door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sea salt caramel was, it turned out, really good. Adrien broke off a piece for Plagg.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d the little cat spirit complained.</p>\n<p>Adrien sat back against his pillows. \u201cI only got two of these things. Be happy I\u2019m sharing at all.\u201d He popped the last of the macaron in his mouth. A little rich, but Marinette was right \u2014 it was a good cold-weather flavor.</p>\n<p>\u201cMon dieu. What a <em> disgusting </em>grin,\u201d Plagg said.</p>\n<p>Adrien glared up at him. \u201cJust because you never smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI smile all the time,\u201d Plagg countered. \u201cUsually about cheese, I grant you, but your statement is false nonetheless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien crossed his arms behind his head and sighed happily. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun to smile about a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg sat on his knee. \u201cI fail to see the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Adrien glanced at him. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you never had a crush on anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am over <em>five thousand</em> years old,\u201d Plagg huffed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve fallen in love more times than you can count?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have done nothing of the kind. There is no other specie quite like the human being for falling so disastrously and <em> so often </em>in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien let his hands fall to his lap. \u201cDisastrous, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg\u2019s whiskers twitched. \u201cI mean. <em> Occasionally </em>disastrous. Certainly not a guaranteed thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien groaned. \u201cWhat the hell was I thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know,\u201d Plagg sniffed. \u201cHowever, you asked, she said yes \u2014 rather loudly \u2014 and now you are simply waiting on the details. You are in it, my good man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Adrien reached for his phone. It hadn\u2019t been more than two inches away from him since he\u2019d gotten home from the bakery. Its persistent silence was demoralizing.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll call.\u201d Plagg floated up from his knee to hover in mid-air. \u201cShe always calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s eyes fixed on the little spirit. \u201cShe <em> always </em>calls?\u201d he repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both be fine.\u201d Plagg drifted up to his favorite bookshelf. \u201cJust keep me out of it as much as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... Plagg?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bzzt. Bzzt. Bzzt. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien jerked and held up his phone.</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Marinette Dupain-Cheng calling\u2026</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien swallowed hard and closed his eyes. <em> What the fuck, Plagg. </em>He cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-hi. Marinette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Paris was lovely this time of year. So festive, with even more twinkling lights than usual. Unfortunately, this evening, some of those lights belonged to an overstressed holiday shopper, akumatized into an aggressive Christmas tree.</p>\n<p>\u201cChat Noir!\u201d Ladybug yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s the little teddy bear ornament! Toward the top! I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p>\n<p>He could just see it from here. It was hardly visible amid the huge, ornate globes and icicles all over the angry tree. Now, normally a tree was hardly a problem for a cat. However, \u00a0Ladybug was currently fastened to this one with tinsel. Silver was a good look for her.</p>\n<p>But that aside, if Chat Noir was careless with his Cataclysm, he could injure Ladybug as well as the tree, who was in fact a person. A dick of a person but a person nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Chat Noir bounced experimentally on the flagpole, his less-than-choice perch on the side of a building. If he had Ladybug\u2019s luck, he\u2019d no doubt find the perfect opening. Unfortunately...</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, whatEVER!\u201d he yelled, and he leapt.</p>\n<p>A swipe with his destructive magic cut Ladybug neatly away from the tree, giving him only seconds to relocate that stupid glass teddy bear among the boughs. Not an easy task when you\u2019re clinging to an angry Christmas tree.</p>\n<p>\u201cHang on!\u201d Ladybug shouted, and Chat Noir heard the familiar <em> swish </em>of her yo-yo. With a sharp yank, she lashed the tree to a lamp post, giving Chat Noir a chance to scramble up the rest of the tree. With seconds to spare, he shattered the tiny ornament right before his Cataclysm petered out.</p>\n<p>He breathed a sigh of relief as he watched a black butterfly emerge \u2014 finally \u2014 from the object of the shopper\u2019s obsession. \u201cAll yours, milady,\u201d he sang, a bit breathless. A bucking Christmas tree was really no joke.</p>\n<p>The first warning beep of his miraculous sounded, but Chat Noir sat back to watch Ladybug work her restoring magic.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d spent the weekend pinching himself that he\u2019d gotten a date (an actual, honest-to-god <em> date </em>) with Ladybug. Marinette had only stammered a little bit on the phone when they\u2019d talked about details. He wondered if she\u2019d been reading from a script.</p>\n<p>Chat Noir grinned to himself. They were going to a Christmas light show in a couple days, and he, personally, was pretty pleased with the idea. He\u2019d thought about going to see a movie (so cliche) or going out to dinner (so intimate. So much room for embarrassment. So not happening) and had been elated when Marinette had timidly mentioned the little holiday festival coming up in their neighborhood. There would be music and lights and maybe some games and definitely some food and probably some special performances\u2026 it would be perfect.</p>\n<p>And, he wasn\u2019t going to lie, the fact that Marinette/Ladybug had brought it up and not Adrien/Chat Noir was something of a relief. All Plagg\u2019s talk about \u201cdestruction\u201d and \u201cbad luck\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d had rather shaken him up.</p>\n<p>A second beep from his miraculous made him sit up. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d he said with a grin as he offered Ladybug their customary fistbump.</p>\n<p>She smiled, but it seemed a little\u2026 distracted.</p>\n<p>Speaking of.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay,\u201d Chat Noir began, \u201chow did you get yourself tangled in tinsel anyway?\u201d He grinned. \u201cIs my lady the one out of it this week?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug blushed and looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry your head about it, kitty. I was fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> that </em> is definitely true.\u201d Chat Noir paused and was only a little disappointed that the flirty line didn\u2019t have a Marinette effect. \u201cI was just wondering if you had\u2026 something on your mind?\u201d <em> I am angling, I am so going to out myself, this is such a dumb\u2014 </em></p>\n<p>She looked up sharply. \u201cWhat could be on my mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, um. I dunno.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cYou doing anything cool this week?\u201d <em> You\u2019re an idiot. A complete\u2014 </em></p>\n<p>Ladybug ducked her head and put way too much focus on recoiling her yo-yo. \u201cUm,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Chat Noir\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cUm?\u201d he repeated, trying to keep the glee from his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut up, kitty! I just\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ladybug hooked her yo-yo around her waist and turned to face him, arms folded. \u201cI have a date that I\u2019m looking forward to. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Electricity skimmed over his entire body. \u201cOhhhhh? Do tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, there\u2019s nothing to tell! Why do you want to know anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in her voice gave him pause. It was sort of\u2026 cautious. Chat Noir shrugged. \u201cI am interested in my lady\u2019s well-being. So what are you going to do on this date?\u201d His ring beeped a third time.</p>\n<p>Ladybug raised an eyebrow. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you, ah, be leaving about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a minute, in a minute,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cWhat are you looking forward to about your date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why </em>are you asking? Oh. Wait. Wait, wait.\u201d Ladybug put her hands on her hips. \u201c<em>You </em>know who I am. Right?\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cDid you already know I had a date?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Shit. </em>She was too sharp by half. Not that he was being in any way subtle. \u201cEr,\u201d was all he could think of to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmygod, Chat, if you sabotage my date, I am\u2014\u201d Ladybug pulled herself up to her full height, which was barely above his chin. It was cute. \u201cWe will have words.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSabotage?\u201d He blinked. The thought had never occurred to him. Probably because he was the one actually going on the date, but\u2026 she had a sort of point? Chat Noir destroyed things. It\u2019s just kind of what he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Hey.\u201d Ladybug put a hand on his arm. She looked up at him, eyes wide. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry, that was really unfair of me. Of course you\u2019d never\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He backed away. Grinned. \u201cNo worries, my lady. You will have a fabulous date, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014\u201d He braced his staff against a concrete block and vaulted himself onto an awning. He turned to look down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll even have a word with the man in charge, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cWh-buh\u2026 Ch-<em> Chaaaatt!! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He was out of time. He could feel it. \u201cEnjoy your date, princess!\u201d Chat Noir zipped up the side of the building and was out of sight.</p>\n<p>Just in time. He breathed a sigh of relief as Plagg released his hold over the ring on his right hand. Adrien sat cross-legged behind a monstrous air conditioner and let his heart slow to a normal pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheese,\u201d Plagg gasped. \u201cGive me cheese!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a bit,\u201d Adrien said mildly. \u201cGotta wait till she\u2019s far enough away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Plagg settled on his knee. \u201cYou kept me waiting long enough, I must say. It was all I could do to hold on until you got up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that. I just\u2026\u201d Adrien ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI got nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard the sabotage comment, yeah? What if that\u2019s a real thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg was quiet. Which was alarming.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlagg?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShush, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking?\u201d Adrien repeated. \u201cAbout whether or not Chat Noir is a personal risk to a girl he\u2019s going on a date with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg groaned. \u201cChat Noir is naturally destructive! You know this! You may think the black leather pantsuit is fun, but ta-da, you\u2019ve also been given a healthy dose of a very real thing called bad luck, courtesy, me. Trust, I\u2019ve been around myself for a very long time, and I can honestly say that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien and Plagg froze into one very panicked statute.</p>\n<p>\u201cChat, I know\u2026 I know you\u2019re up here.\u201d Ladybug\u2019s voice sounded unsure. Timid. More like Marinette. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re probably back to normal now. So. I won\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien exhaled carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sucked in a hard breath. <em> Shit! </em></p>\n<p>\u201c... I guess that\u2019s a no.\u201d A shuffling noise indicated that Ladybug had sat down on the other side of the air conditioning unit. \u201cYou know, I have every right to just walk right around here and get a good look at your face once and for all. Or at least, I think I do,\u201d she finished quietly.</p>\n<p>Adrien stayed quiet. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted, to be honest. <em> Yes, Ladybug, please come find out who I am. </em> But on the other hand. <em> I\u2019d really, really like to go out on a date with Marinette. Just as Adrien. Just me. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ladybug continued with a sigh, \u201cTwo things. One, I\u2019m really, really, very sorry about the sabotage remark. I don\u2019t\u2026 know why I said that. You\u2019d never do that, you\u2019re my friend and my partner, and you\u2019ve only ever supported me. So that was completely unfair of me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Wow. </em>Adrien was pretty confident he\u2019d never received such an incredibly thorough apology before. From anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. No. It\u2019s not.\u201d But her smile was practically audible. \u201cBut maybe we\u2019ll let this one slide. And two\u2026 well. <em> Two </em>\u2026\u201d She paused, her voice strained.</p>\n<p>\u201cLadybug?\u201d Adrien prompted.</p>\n<p>She laughed. \u201cWow, that sounds so weird when I\u2019m not, you know, wearing the costume.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien jerked his knees up to his chest. <em> Marinette?! Of </em> course <em> it\u2019s Marinette, you goldfish. It\u2019s been Marinette, it\u2019s </em> always <em> Marinette. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to say that, if you\u2019ve got questions about my date, you can ask.\u201d She cleared her throat nervously. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend. You can ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that. Certainly brought a torrent of very weird and mixed emotions. <em> Her friend? </em> Which cemented the fact that Ladybug did not, in fact, have romantic aspirations about Chat Noir. Still. <em> Sigh. </em>But! Here was an unprecedented opportunity to make sure that the date would not, could not, in any way, be a failure. Probably.</p>\n<p>Adrien leaned his head back against the air conditioner. \u201cWhy are you going out with this guy anyway?\u201d He closed his eyes. Too straight-forward. Too invasive. Whatever. He\u2019d gone from thinking Marinette didn\u2019t like Adrien at all to realizing that Marinette might actually have a crush on Adrien to knowing that Ladybug still didn\u2019t like Chat Noir. He <em> had </em> to know what she was thinking, and this was probably an unfair way to go about it, but\u2014</p>\n<p>Marinette laughed. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you know who he is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien grinned despite himself. \u201cAnswering a question with a question is against the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you do know him.\u201d Her voice was sharp.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends. Sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes?\u201d Marinette sighed. \u201cHow are you only sometimes friends with Adrien Agreste?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cUh. He gets a little boring?\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted. \u201cOkay, well, maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m going on a date with him and you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien cocked his head. What a\u2026 weird conversation. \u201cOkay, so you\u2019re going on a date with sometimes-boring-maybe-not Adrien. Do you know what you\u2019re gonna do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Look at Christmas lights mostly, I think. Maybe some hot chocolate. Maybe it\u2019ll snow if we\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien opened his mouth so he could breathe easier. God, she sounded so <em> happy </em>. \u201cSounds kinda simple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it were any more complicated, I don\u2019t think I could handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just so afraid I\u2019m gonna mess something up, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Adrien\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cYou? Ladybug? With good luck coming out of your ears?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette groaned. \u201cI think that turns off as soon as I\u2019m back to being Ma \u2014 myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien reflected on Marinette\u2019s daily activity. Bumping into things, saying words wrong, locking herself in the bathroom to get away from him. Fine, maybe she didn\u2019t always have good luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s okay,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause Adrien will be there. Even if I\u2019m a little weird \u2014 oh god, don\u2019t let me be weird \u2014 he\u2019ll be smooth as silk. No doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Adrien choked. \u201cWhat if, uh, what if he\u2019s not? What if he\u2019s more like, I dunno, me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou?\u201d Marinette sounded confused. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cwhat if he gets stuff wrong or. Spills hot chocolate on you? What if it doesn\u2019t snow? What if he makes a stupid joke? What if you\u2026 decide you don\u2019t like him after all,\u201d he added, his voice low.</p>\n<p>Marinette laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid I\u2019m not going to like another guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien sighed. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d he mumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, kitty cat, are particularly down on yourself tonight,\u201d Marinette said matter-of-factly. \u201cMy date with Adrien aside \u2014 which will be wonderful and I\u2019m only slightly nervous, thank you very much \u2014 he has nothing to worry about if he acts like you. A little bit like you,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cI could frankly do without the puns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien\u2019s mouth gaped. <em> If Adrien acts like me, it\u2019ll be fine? But no puns. No puns? Who doesn\u2019t like puns? Ladybug doesn\u2019t like my puns?! </em></p>\n<p>Plagg chose that moment to tug at his shirt collar. \u201cAdrien?\u201d he whispered. \u201cCheese? I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re five thousand years old,\u201d Adrien hissed. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone without cheese before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to it anymore! Camembert! Now!\u201d Plagg threatened quietly.</p>\n<p>Adrien stuffed Plagg in his shirt pocket and got to one knee. \u201cYou love my puns, milady,\u201d he said, raising his voice. \u201cNo use denying it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdrien is allowed <em> one </em>pun before I lose my shit,\u201d Marinette promised.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne? That\u2019s hardly enough to show off a good sense of humor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to make do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him he can have three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChat.\u201d Marinette\u2019s voice sounded like she wanted to be fierce but was really just trying not to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll think up new ones. You\u2019ll love them.\u201d Adrien stood. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d stay there for a minute or two, princess. I have to go feed an obnoxious cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Marinette\u2019s response was immediate. Honest.</p>\n<p>Adrien bit his lip. \u201cJust one more thing.\u201d Plagg groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Marinette hummed.</p>\n<p>Adrien swallowed. \u201cWhat do you want out of this date? What do you want to happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence stretched on for several seconds. Adrien barely breathed. Even Plagg stayed quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Marinette began slowly, \u201cI just want him to have fun being with me.\u201d She paused. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien tilted his head back to stare up at the fading twilight. There she was. All in one. Kind Marinette. Confident Ladybug. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm? You say something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Adrien headed for the emergency staircase on the side of the building. This was always trickier without Plagg\u2019s magic, but he\u2019d be fine. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to hear about your date!\u201d</p>\n<p>A faraway \u201cBye, kitty cat!\u201d carried him down the rusty steps.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Nathalie.\u201d Adrien accepted the steaming mug through his cracked bedroom door.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t tell your father I\u2019m letting you have coffee this late,\u201d she said tiredly. His dad\u2019s assistant always sounded tired.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d he promised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should really have your homework done by now anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely. I will <em> totally </em>get better at that. I will get started right away.\u201d Adrien edged the door closed a bit further.</p>\n<p>Nathalie\u2019s frown said she was unconvinced, but she turned on her heel and left.</p>\n<p>Adrien shut the door with a sigh and climbed the stairs to his desk. His Mandarin suffered when he tried to do it this late, but it was either that or not hand it in at all tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Plagg sat on his mousepad, licking the last bits of cheese off his tiny fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Adrien teased. He opened his notebook.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch.\u201d Plagg floated up and settled back down in the middle of the notebook.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlagg,\u201d Adrien groaned. \u201cI have a worksheet and forty-two audio reviews. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNathalie\u2019s right. You should have gotten this done earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t, so now I <em> really </em>have to, so if you\u2019ll move your butt\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and I need to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien stared at the little spirit sitting on his desk. \u201cAbout?\u201d he whispered hoarsely, dread pooling in his gut.</p>\n<p>Plagg smiled, and it was not reassuring. \u201cHistory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki paused with a piece of chocolate chip cookie halfway to her mouth. \u201cYou told him </span>\n<em>\n<span>what </span>\n</em>\n<span>now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg gnawed moodily on a microscopic block of cheese. \u201cYou know. Our history.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOur history?\u201d the little red spirit repeated. \u201cYours and mine\u2026 personally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat help would that have been?\u201d Plagg snorted. \u201cThe history of Ladybug and Chat Noir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, all of it?\u201d Tikki asked, incredulous. \u201cYou kept the boy from his homework that long?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust the important bits!\u201d Plagg insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not completely unaware of the clock. Unlike some people,\u201d he grumbled under his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki narrowed her eyes. \u201cAnd those important bits would be\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, I just don\u2019t want him to walk into this unaware, you know?\u201d Plagg fidgeted. He had the distinct impression he was going to get yelled at. After all these years, he still could never pinpoint </span>\n<em>\n<span>why.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2018This?\u2019 \u2018This\u2019 being a date between teenagers?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not all it is!\u201d Plagg squeaked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s beyond us, Plagg.\u201d Tikki waved a tiny hand. \u201cChat and Ladybug will always try to figure out how they belong together. Let these two enjoy their innocent little holiday festival. I doubt your boy will be able to get it together for anything beyond holding hands, anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg glared. \u201cThat tone is completely uncalled for.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome now. Chat never becomes truly suave until his late twenties, you know that. Ladybug always has to do all the work if they get together before that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg resolved to teach Adrien a couple things immediately. For now, he changed the subject back to the pressing matter at hand. \u201cWe cannot ignore statistics. When Ladybug and Chat Noir become romantically entangled this young, their chances of a long-lasting partnership dwindle astronomically.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki pursed her lips, which was alarming. Plagg had expected another dismissive comment. \u201cThese two need to stay together as long as they can,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cHawkmoth is obnoxiously persistent this time. If Adrien and Marinette disband at this early stage\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t pass on the miraculous to a new Chat and Ladybug while he\u2019s this powerful. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg balked. \u201cYou\u2019d\u2026 you\u2019d take away the miraculous from Adrien and Marinette?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\u201cI just said</span> <span>we can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d Tikki reminded him. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2026 but they always give them up on their own!\u201d Plagg\u2019s mind was spinning. \u201cWhat would that mean, to make them\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill you stop panicking?\u201d Tikki interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t know what that would do. We can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight.\u201d Plagg breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe just have to make sure they don\u2019t ruin their partnership too early.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d Plagg caught a note in Tikki\u2019s voice that gave him pause. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTheir date is this Friday, correct?\u201d Tikki floated in midair, one leg crossed over the other. She swung her foot thoughtfully. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTikki,\u201d Plagg began nervously. \u201cTikki, now, wait. You know we have to leave it up to them. It never works if I\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about forcing them into a relationship,\u201d Tikki assured him loftily. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Oh, good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I\u2019m talking about making sure their date is perfect.\u201d Tikki had a disturbing gleam in her eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg felt his ears flatten against his head. \u201cPerfect?\u201d he choked. \u201cTikki\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m </span>\n</em>\n<span>going to be there. I really think we should just count it a win if no one ends the night on fire.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cQuite.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c... Tikki?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, sorry. Just wondering. What would happen if you weren\u2019t there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg\u2019s whiskers stood straight out from his cheeks. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so aghast,\u201d Tikki chided. \u201cIt would only be for a couple hours at the very most. Can you picture either of them able to withstand their own nervous energy that long?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat I can\u2019t picture,\u201d Plagg spluttered, \u201cis sending Adrien off alone without me. Good heavens, Tikki!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The little red kwami had the decency to look slightly embarrassed. \u201cRight, right. Of course not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf </span>\n<em>\n<span>course </span>\n</em>\n<span>not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat if we were both just a little bit of a distance away though?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTikki!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m serious! You and I could follow just a little ways off. We\u2019d never lose sight of them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg folded his arms. \u201cWhat benefit could that possibly have if you want them to have a perfect evening? You\u2019re good luck! You should stick to them both like glue!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was planning on sticking with you, you idiot,\u201d Tikki retorted. \u201cAnd anyway, if we\u2019re both not directly on them, then maybe they\u2019ll have a chance for a genuinely normal first date. Yeah? No bad luck/good luck pulling them apart.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg hated how Tikki could make utter nonsense sound logical. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we\u2019re not near them, they\u2019ll have as good a chance as any,\u201d she reiterated, her tone tempting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said that,\u201d Plagg snipped. He sighed. \u201cHow\u2019s Marinette doing? Is she as nervous as Adrien?\u201d It was a diversion, possibly a useless one, he knew. But he needed time to think. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Leave Adrien while he was awake? Not be with Adrien? </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki\u2019s antennae twitched. \u201cThe entirety of her closet has been on her bedroom floor for two days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg watched as Adrien tossed another jacket onto his floor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy is this so hard?\u201d Adrien groaned. \u201cI get dressed just fine every other day!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps you should ask your father for help? Styling and design are, after all, his\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am not asking Gabriel Agreste for advice on what to wear on a first date.\u201d Adrien stopped him with a glare. \u201cThat would be, I don\u2019t know, cheating or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course. Much better to spend the next three days stressing about it. I totally agree.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is your damn fault, you know. All those stats. Who does that to someone before they even go on the date?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg coughed. \u201cIt was merely my intention to\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTwenty-five percent of relationships between Ladybug and Chat Noir end before they\u2019re 18?\u201d Adrien pressed. \u201cSixty-two percent chance that Ladybug marries someone else? </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eighteen percent </span>\n</em>\n<span>chance that Chat Noir never has a relationship longer than three months? Ever? With </span>\n<em>\n<span>anyone?!\"</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEighteen point six, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien practically had steam coming out his ears. \u201cAnd you thought this was helpful for me to know </span>\n<em>\n<span>why? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Thanks, Plagg, it\u2019s not like there was any pressure at all beforehand!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to be hurt,\u201d Plagg said quietly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien went still, staring at him.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow many of those things do you think I\u2019ve seen firsthand?\u201d Plagg went on. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for every last one of them \u2014 every broken relationship, every partnership that ended due to sheer bad luck, every missed opportunity, and I can tell you that Chat Noir\u2019s life is </span>\n<em>\n<span>so much </span>\n</em>\n<span>easier when...\u201d He stopped. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen?\u201d Adrien prompted, stepping closer to where Plagg floated midair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg grimaced and half turned away from him. \u201cWell. The times you never find out\u2026 or when you decide Ladybug isn\u2019t what you want\u2026 You\u2019re never hurt as badly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The silence stretched on long enough that Plagg sneaked a look at Adrien. The boy was blinking. Slowly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d Adrien began. \u201cWait. You\u2026 don\u2019t want me to go on a date with Ladybug\u2026 because you\u2019re scared?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not scared!\u201d Plagg bit out, perhaps too quickly. \u201cBut statistics show\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou need to take a stats class,\u201d Adrien said. He tugged one of Plagg\u2019s massive ears and turned back to his closet. \u201cThat\u2019s not how odds work.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcuse </span>\n<em>\n<span>me,\"</span>\n</em>\nPlagg huffed. \u201cI am well acquainted with\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve never been Chat Noir before,\u201d Adrien interrupted, holding up a sweater. \u201cAnd Marinette\u2019s never been Ladybug.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg waited for a moment. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy point is\u2014\u201d Adrien turned around, draping the sweater over his chest. \u201c\u2014Chat Noir and Ladybug start over from scratch each time. Both of us are entirely new variables. You can\u2019t count on us to follow any pattern at all. What do you think, is blue my color?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We should pick out something that will complement your plethoric education.\u201d But the jab was mostly reflex. Plagg twisted a whisker, thinking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette paused in the midst of seating herself on a bench across from Alya. \u201cEating lunch?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya looked up at her over her glasses. \u201cHere?\u201d she asked, in a tone that implied Marinette was in the process of doing something very stupid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh.\u201d Marinette glanced around the lunchroom. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold to eat outside?\u201d She sat down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. No. Babe.\u201d Alya leaned forward. \u201cWhy are you eating with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette watched her blankly. \u201cUh. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a date in a couple days?\u201d Alya glanced meaningfully toward a table on the other side of the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette squeaked and refused to turn around. \u201cAlya! It is </span>\n<em>\n<span>one </span>\n</em>\n<span>date! We aren\u2019t\u2026 we\u2019re not </span>\n<em>\n<span>dating.\"</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya folded her arms. \u201cAdrien asked you out. I doubt it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want your company.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to walk over there and\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Alya cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not planning on taking him right on the table, are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\"Alya!\"</span>\n</em>Marinette hissed. \u201cWill you\n<em>\n<span>shut up!\"</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarinette, love.\u201d Alya sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared, but\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am not scared!\u201d Marinette tried to sound scathing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya gave her a look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Marinette knew she was being led by the nose, she </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew </span>\n</em>\n<span>it, and was helpless to do anything about it. \u201cYeah? Right. Well. Right.\u201d She picked up her lunchbox and marched away from the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>But then she saw that incredible, gorgeous blonde hair across the room. And those delicious shoulders. And that\u2026</p>\n<p>Nino caught her eye. It was a mercy she didn\u2019t drop her lunchbox immediately. His eyes lit up, and he gestured her over.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette froze. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Shit. Shit shit shit. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien turned around in his seat. He looked surprised to see her standing in the middle of the lunch hall, but his smile was undoubtedly pleased. That stunningly unfair Agreste smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>SHIT. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Somehow. Somehow, her feet managed to move her forward. Which would be worse \u2014 sitting next to Adrien? Sitting across from him?</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, Alya\u2019s not coming with you?\u201d Nino said before Marinette could act on either option. \u201cWell, now she\u2019s all alone, not cool. Take my seat.\u201d He stood, grabbed his tray, and left.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Well. That solves that. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Marinette slid onto the bench across from Adrien. She hazarded a glance at the insanely attractive boy and blinked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien was glaring after Nino. Marinette wilted. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I knew it. I knew it, crap, this was not a good idea, when am I ever going to tell Alya no\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, could he be any more obvious, huh?\u201d Adrien turned back to her with a smile. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh\u2026 um?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Stop it, Marinette, please please be able to put sentences together.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTell me, I promise I won\u2019t pass it on. Does Alya have any kind of feeling for Nino?\u201d Adrien leaned forward conspiratorially. Marinette felt like passing out. Those goddamn green eyes were going to kill her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNino? Um\u2026\u201d Marinette tried hard to think about the actual question. People had conversation by paying attention, that was how it worked. \u201cShe\u2019s never, ah, said anything to me about\u2026 him. Um.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Work on the ums, girl, come on. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Adrien sighed heavily. \u201cPoor Nino. She would definitely tell you, right? If she did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>To be honest, Alya seemed too caught up in tracking Ladybug to have much interest in dating. \u201cShe\u2026 probably would?\u201d Marinette sipped from her water bottle thoughtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know how interested she is in guys, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s eyebrows went into his hairline.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette replayed her last sentence in her mind. \u201cOh. No! That\u2019s not what I\u2026 well, to be honest, I don\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>know \u2014 </span>\n</em>\n<span>I don\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>know either! \u2014 Alya\u2019s... preferences\u2026 oh god.\u201d Marinette buried her face in her hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien laughed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was beautiful. Marinette peeked through her fingers. He sounded happy, no, fucking delighted.</span>\n<span>His head was thrown back, his arm was wrapped around his stomach, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>she had made him laugh. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Even though it was probably because she was Queen of the Dorks, but she could work with that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess either way Nino\u2019s on his own.\u201d Adrien was still giggling to himself as he picked up his sandwich. He looked up at her, and the sandwich paused halfway to his mouth. Gorgeous green eyes went wide, and his beautiful skin went a little pink.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette allowed herself the softest sigh. </span>\n<em>\n<span>How are you so pretty?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d he said softly. \u201cMarinette?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMm?\u201d she hummed. This was nice. He was nice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien didn\u2019t say anything else. He just watched her, eyes huge, mouth a little open, and \u2014 </span>\n<em>\n<span>his mouth is nice</span>\n</em>\n<span>...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The thought startled her out of, </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh god,</span>\n</em>\nwhatever she\u2019d been doing. What had she been doing?! Marinette coughed and sat up straight, opening her lunchbox with a\n<em>\n<span>clang! </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Say something! Anything! Tell him you\u2019re Ladybug! ANYTHING.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo!\u201d Marinette busied herself with the contents of her lunchbox. \u201cAha, Friday, right?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ohmigod, ohmigod, that\u2019s right, bring all the attention back to you and him and dating and relationships and AUGH\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien took a moment before answering, and Marinette couldn\u2019t bring herself to look up from her lunch. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cYeah. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She glanced up then, knowing her shoulders were still hunched around her ears. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll have fun,\u201d Adrien went on. He nodded his head, as though he were convincing himself. Which Marinette wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to do with, but then he smiled to himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll both be there. And we\u2019re both pretty cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette cocked her head. It was a somewhat bizarre pep talk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Adrien said with a finality that made her blink. \u201cWe\u2019re used to dealing with much worse\u2014\u201d And then apparently it was his turn to reflect in horror. \u201cUh! I mean\u2014?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was such a relief, honestly. Marinette felt her lip curl into a smirk she\u2019d usually never be able to manage in front of Adrien Agreste. She could feel the nerves pulsing off of him in waves, and it was such a goddamn comfort.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d she intoned. \u201cI am used to dealing with </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>much worse than going out and looking at Christmas lights with a beautiful blonde.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s head snapped up, and Marinette wanted to bite off her tongue. Almost. Whatever! She met his gaze somewhat defiantly. They were going on a date! It stood to reason that he would know she thought he was at least a little bit attractive! </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A slow grin crossed Adrien\u2019s face. \u201cWow.\u201d He leaned forward on his elbows. \u201cYour life sounds terrible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo terrible,\u201d Marinette agreed with a heavy sigh, spearing a tomato wedge from her salad. </span>\n<em>\n<span>This is easy? Oh my god, this is easy! </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, I kind of feel bad,\u201d Adrien purred. \u201cWhat kind of a guy makes a girl go out on a cold night in December for their first date?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I never said he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>nice.\"</span>\n</em>\nMarinette widened her eyes innocently.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re only in it for the looks, huh?\u201d Adrien\u2019s grin was nearly splitting his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d She flashed him a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s going to buy me hot chocolate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien choked on a laugh. He didn\u2019t respond. Just looked back at her with that beautiful, </span>\n<em>\n<span>happy </span>\n</em>\n<span>smile.</span>\n<span>For several seconds. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette felt her own grin falter. Adrien was still\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Adrien,</span>\n</em>\nand he was looking at her in a way she frankly didn\u2019t know what to do with. \u201cUm.\u201d\n<em>\n<span>Dammit with the ums again! </span>\n</em>\n<span>She tucked her hair behind her ear and glanced down into her lunchbox. \u201cWhat, um, what are you\u2026 what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>WHAT\u2019S ON YOUR MIND ARE YOU SERIOUS.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien blew out a breath.\u00a0</span>\n<span>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you act like this around me all the time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette\u2019s eyes flew open wide. Her mouth fell open.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien stared back at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c... Oops.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\"Oops?!\"</span>\n</em>\n<span> Plagg shrieked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAugh!\u201d Adrien shielded himself from tiny paws beating at his forehead. \u201cIt was an accident! It just slipped out!\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well, you are so lucky that Marinette didn\u2019t pick up on the fact that you said that to her before when you were wearing black leather!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt didn\u2019t even cross her mind! And what are you doing, you shouldn\u2019t be out of the bag, we\u2019re at school!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg glared at him before retreating into Adrien\u2019s schoolbag. Angry green eyes peeked out from its depths. \u201cYou don\u2019t know it didn\u2019t cross her mind,\u201d he mumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe was just being Marinette!\u201d Adrien defended himself. He scowled at his own reflection in the bathroom mirror. \u201cGoing all shy with compliments and stuff!\u201d Except she hadn\u2019t been shy the whole time. At one point, she\u2019d looked at him like she could eat him with a spoon, and he really, really wanted to see that again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t complimenting her, were you? You were holding a neon light over your head, shouting that you were Chat Noir!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, if she hasn\u2019t made the connection by now, that one phrase was not enough to do it.\u201d Adrien inhaled deeply. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Right. Right, there\u2019s no way. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He bit his lip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette had stared at him for several speechless moments. It had been agonizing. Finally, </span>\n<em>\n<span>finally, </span>\n</em>\n<span>he had thought to laugh and say something like he hadn\u2019t meant to make her feel self-conscious about how they\u2019d interacted before and that it was fine and he was happy they could talk now. He\u2019d probably babbled, to be honest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette had offered him a weak smile that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cMe\u2026 me too,\u201d she\u2019d whispered. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d tried to recover, tried to get her to talk about their date in a couple days. But then \u2014 Adrien groaned and bowed his head over the sink. He\u2019d had to say something about how nice it would be to walk around Paris at night with her, </span>\n<em>\n<span>thinking it would be a smooth thing to say, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and Marinette had gotten that same deer-in-the-headlights look again.\u00a0<em>Gah,\u00a0</em>and he'd said that thing about how they were both used to dealing with a lot worse...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg was right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was like he was shouting for her to notice who he was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he wanted her to, right? There was no real reason she couldn\u2019t know. He knew she was Ladybug, turnabout was fair play, and so on. Yes? And all he\u2019d really wanted out of her as Marinette was for her to be able to talk with him like a normal human being. So. Mission accomplished.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Except. Well. Damn it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>wanted to go on a date without Chat Noir in the background. He wanted Marinette to look at him like that again, just one more time before she put all of his pieces together and decided she didn\u2019t, in fact, want him all that much thanks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her later,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAfter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Plagg popped his head out of the schoolbag. \u201cWhat? Why? Are you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Why? Adrien didn\u2019t exactly know. Except that it felt </span>\n<em>\n<span>wrong </span>\n</em>\n<span>not to. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that I know and she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he thought out loud. \u201cAnd I want her to trust me. And I want her to\u2014\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>like me. I want Ladybug and Marinette both to like me. All of me. Dammit, I want that. And if she doesn\u2019t. If she won\u2019t. Then. Then I need to know sooner rather than later. But maybe a little bit later. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg was quiet for a while. \u201cWell. I hope your date goes well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien glanced down at his schoolbag. \u201cPlagg?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet me tell you this now. So you can get used to the idea. I\u2019m not going.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien sucked in a breath. \u201cWhat\u2026 what does that mean? You\u2019re always with\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me on a date. I\u2019m sure you can figure out why.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlagg, what \u2014 you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re some kind of, I don\u2019t know, bad luck charm for crying out loud.\u201d Adrien tried to laugh, but he knew it sounded weird. \u201cDon\u2019t be like this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Plagg shot him a look that was older than dirt.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut.\u201d Adrien felt panic rise in his gut. This should be fine. He hadn't always had Plagg around, why was this a problem now? \u201cWhat if someone needs Chat Noir?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure Paris will be fine for a couple hours.\u201d Plagg pretended to examine a mechanical pencil in Adrien\u2019s bag.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cParis will not fall because two stupid teenagers decide to cuddle underneath Christmas lights for an evening!\u201d Plagg whisper-shouted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, A) neither of us are stupid,\u201d Adrien retorted. \u201cAnd B)...\u201d He swallowed. \u201cDo you\u2026 do you think we\u2019ll cuddle?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg burrowed deeply into his schoolbag and refused to come out for the rest of the day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien wrapped his light blue scarf around his neck, even though it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>just </span>\n</em>\n<span>a little too light for a December evening. Hey, it was kind of like a good luck charm, okay? The one gift his dad ever gave him that made any sense at all. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That over a navy blue peacoat, some slim canvas pants, and some boots, and voila. Adrien gave himself a once-over in his mirror. He wasn't completely hopeless without a stylist. And hair dresser and makeup and key lighting. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop \u2014\u201d Plagg swatted at his hand. \u201c\u2014 messing with your hair. You\u2019re fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still not coming with me?\u201d Adrien wished he didn\u2019t sound quite so nervous. It shouldn\u2019t feel so much like he was leaving his babysitter at home. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg sniffed. \u201cI have better things to do than watch you fail miserably at holding hands with Marinette.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201c</span></em>What<em> \u2014 what the hell, Plagg?!\u201d\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t have anything better to do than watch Adrien fail miserably at holding hands with Marinette,\u201d Plagg grumbled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki giggled from their vantage point in a shop\u2019s holiday wreath. \u201cWell. It\u2019s not </span>\n<em>\n<span>entirely </span>\n</em>\n<span>his fault.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg watched the young couple walking several yards in front of them. Twinkling lights all around, steam from various food stalls, and yes, even a sugary dusting of </span>\n<em>\n<span>snow</span></em>, and neither kid could get their shit together enough to so much as bump shoulders.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYouth is wasted on the wrong people,\u201d he growled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stole that,\u201d Tikki said without any real judgment.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe could at least buy her a hot chocolate,\u201d Plagg complained. \u201cShe told him she wanted some \u2014 twice! As Ladybug </span>\n<em>\n<span>and </span>\n</em>\n<span>as Marinette! Hand her a drink and boom, perfectly good chance to hold her hand, there you go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoesn\u2019t </span>\n<em>want</em>to?\u201d Plagg stared at Tikki. \u201cThe boy has done nothing but scheme up one ludicrous scenario after another as an\n<em>\n<span>excuse</span></em>. If he doesn\u2019t by the end of the night, I am absolutely handing my ring over to someone else, I swear it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis must be so frustrating for you when you\u2019re so good at courtship.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c... I\u2019m! I\u2019m perfectly adequate at\u2014!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShush, they\u2019re walking over to the skating rink.\u201d Tikki pushed off from the wreath. \u201cWe should get closer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said we should stay at a distance,\u201d Plagg reminded her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have to stay close in case they need to transform, don\u2019t be silly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you said there wasn\u2019t any chance of that happening if we both stayed away from them. No bad luck, good luck, pushing, pulling sort of thing.\u201d Plagg floated after her, biting on his tiny claws. It was a bad habit. It mostly surfaced when he was around </span>\n<em>\n<span>her</span></em>, dammit.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki ignored him as she lit on a string of lights over the skating rink. She watched Marinette shake her head shyly as Adrien gestured to the ice. The girl </span>\n<em>\n<span>did </span>\n</em>\n<span>grab his arm though and pull him toward a food vendor. \u201cGood girl,\u201d Tikki whispered, pleased. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTikki\u2026\u201d Plagg whined.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re right here,\u201d she said with a sigh, not taking her eyes off the young couple. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien was trying not to swallow his tongue. Marinette\u2019s fingers were tight around his arm, and her gaze was focused on the line in front of them at the food stall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hazarded a glance down at her. Her cheeks were bright pink, but that could probably be from the cold, right? </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ohmigod, just flirt, why can\u2019t you? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Adrien pressed his lips together. Plagg had attempted to give him some rather unhelpful tips last night, but\u2026 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Brilliant, yes, great opening line. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He cleared his throat. \u201cLooks like they have different kinds of cocoa. You like peppermint? Vanilla cream?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Good god, why don\u2019t you talk about the weather next?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette rubbed her pink gloves together, eyes sparkling as they waited in line. \u201cI always get Mexican hot chocolate if it\u2019s an option. Chili pepper with </span>\n<em>\n<span>dark </span>\n</em>\n<span>chocolate, of course, and I really hope they have cinnamon sticks because that just\u2014\u201d She glanced up at him suddenly. \u201cAh. Ahaha. It\u2019s. Um. Kind of good?\u201d Her smile slid off her face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien grinned. \u201cThe lady likes things spicy?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette raised an eyebrow. And then laughed. Hard. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien felt his face go up in flames. He was going to kill Plagg. Five-thousand-year-old spirit or no, he would find a way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette laid a hand on his arm, wiping tears away with the other. \u201cThey don\u2019t give models flirting lessons, I guess? That was <em>terrible</em>.\u201d Amazingly, unbelievably, her hand slid down his sleeve, and Adrien felt delicate fingers intertwine with his. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she added, still giggling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s thoughts could have been illustrated with TV static and a series of question marks and exclamation points. </span>\n<em>\n<span>That worked? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Wow, if tripping over stupid pickup lines was what did it for Marinette, this\u2026 could be okay! He straightened, allowing himself a cautious grin. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which might have faltered a little when the guy behind the food stall couldn\u2019t stop checking her out. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh, come on, man, are you kidding me?</span>\n</em>\n<span> But Adrien tried to be satisfied with just catching the guy\u2019s eye and raising an eyebrow. Marinette did look pretty cute after all, in some kind of dressy pink coat that flared at her waist. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Probably made it herself too. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Damn, she was cool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Mexican hot chocolate please,\u201d Marinette said. Her eyes were huge as she clutched the counter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomething spicy for the lady.\u201d The cocoa guy winked at her. \u201cAnd you, man? Can you keep up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe vanilla for me,\u201d Adrien said, daring him to say anything. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette glanced at him as they walked away from the vendor. \u201cDo you not like spicy food?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPfff.\u201d Adrien tugged at his scarf. \u201cI can eat anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, well, then, you have to try this.\u201d She shoved her paper cup underneath his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s to die for, I promise!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien could smell the chili pepper immediately. \u201cUm\u2026 s-sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette gave a happy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you ordered something different. I love sharing food.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien stared at her over the lip of the paper cup. Oh good god, he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>sharing a drink with Ladybug. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He drew in a sharp breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which was a mistake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Anyone who\u2019s ever deeply inhaled cinnamon </span>\n<em>\n<span>knows</span></em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He disintegrated into a fit of ugly, hacking coughs. Dear god, </span>\n<em>\n<span>this </span>\n</em>\n<span>was the drink she\u2019d been positively vibrating for? He could hear Marinette\u2019s nervous squeaking as she guided him to a bench. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you see?\u201d she fretted, dabbing at his red eyes with an honest-to-god handkerchief. \u201cMaybe have some more of your vanilla cocoa, that might stop the burning?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien wanted to say something clever, but he\u2019d already proven that wasn\u2019t his thing. He gulped half of his drink and sighed in relief as the thick, rich chocolate coated his throat. He cracked open one eye. \u201cSorry,\u201d he rasped, trying to smile through his unraveling dignity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette was kneeling in front of him on the freezing sidewalk, one hand clutching her handkerchief, the other gripping the offending spicy chocolate. Her eyes were enormous. And\u2026 and really, </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>close. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice of you to apologize for how I nearly killed you with my drink.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien tried to swallow one last cough. \u201cI think we can just blame my bad luck instead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His eyes widened. Marinette went still.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>No. No, that\u2019s a really common thing to say. No, there\u2019s no </span>\n</em>\n<span>way </span>\n<em>\n<span>she could think\u2014 </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou?\u201d Marinette got to her feet with a light laugh. She slid next to him on the bench. He wouldn\u2019t have hated it if she\u2019d gotten closer. \u201cAdrien Agreste, model, top student, has bad luck?\u201d She watched the Christmas lights in the shop windows across the street with too much interest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>O-kaaay. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He tried to glance at her out of the corner of his eye. \u201cWell. Well, sure it sounds ridiculous if you put it like that. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, you know, completely made of bad luck.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>What am I doing. What am I DOING, Plagg is going to kill me.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMm.\u201d Marinette sipped her cocoa, still looking straight ahead. \u201cProbably only half of you, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien gulped.</p>\n<p>She tilted her face to look up into the twinkling lights twisted through the branches above them. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably not something you let just everybody see,\u201d she went on. \u201cProbably have to keep up the Agreste image pretty hard, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>He watched her. He could feel the sparks in the air from the coded questions. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, taking care with his words. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely easy to let that slip. Sometimes.\u201d It wasn\u2019t enough. He could tell that she knew, she </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew, </span>\n</em>\n<span>but it wasn\u2019t enough, and she couldn\u2019t be sure, and he wanted her to be sure, and so\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould be nice to be lucky all the time instead, yeah?\u201d Adrien leaned back on his hands. The cement bench was cold through his (Agreste-brand) gloves. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette whipped her head around to lock eyes with him. He\u2019d never seen such a look on her face \u2014 there was no shy Marinette here. No completely-in-control Ladybug either. \u201cNo one\u2019s lucky all the time,\u201d she whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut it\u2019s almost like some people have connections or something,\u201d he pressed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cConnections? To luck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you, you might have an in with good luck, right?\u201d He held her gaze, talking fast. \u201cMe, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re the opposite. Of me.\u201d It was not a question.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien held his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou silly cat,\u201d Marinette whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He exhaled. \u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>He watched her throat as she swallowed and looked out at the lights again. \u201cWell. Hi.\u201d She said it quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d And because he thought it was time, he added, \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette rolled her eyes, and it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>Ladybug, but Adrien was still too terrified to grin. \u201cI get to hear that all the time now, huh?\u201d she asked. A smirk tilted her mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t want to talk about how it would be now. Four people smushed into two with only so much room for crushes and friendship. Much better to talk about, \u201cWhen did you figure it out?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her hot chocolate had to be cold by now, but she still drank it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t exactly been subtle since you told me you knew who I was.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, really?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Dammit. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Adrien had known he\u2019d missed a couple steps, but they shouldn\u2019t have added up to her figuring it out. Probably. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou talk the same. Chat and Adrien were sounding more and more alike.\u201d She shot him a look. \u201cYou should work on that if you don\u2019t want anyone else picking up on it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t spend time with anyone else the way I do with you,\u201d Adrien retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Chat Noir hangs out with people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette punched his shoulder softly, and Adrien felt his heart twinge. That was too Ladybug and Chat. No starry-eyed crush in that gesture. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already started acting like Chat in school,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The question gave him pause. Would that be so bad? Totally with it, totally together, totally studious\u2026 what if he just wasn\u2019t anymore?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf I act more like Chat\u2026\u201d he began slowly. \u201cDoes that mean Marinette starts acting more Ladybug? Wouldn\u2019t hurt you to speak your mind a bit more, you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her eyes flashed. \u201cWow. You want me to start right now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could start with why you liked Adrien and not Chat Noir.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Augh, no, why would you ever ask that, STOP. </span>\n</em>\n<span>But he clenched his jaw, waiting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette\u2019s cheeks were bright red. \u201cHow \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t \u2014 <em>you</em> were the one who asked me out!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI asked you out as Chat Noir too, and you never said yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2026 Ladybug is\u2026 well, well, you asked </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ladybug </span>\n</em>\n<span>out as Chat Noir!\u201d she managed. \u201cYou can\u2019t give me any kind of crap for having a crush on Adrien when you were only into the other half of me yourself!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you </span>\n<em>\n<span>do </span>\n</em>\n<span>have a crush on me.\u201d Adrien\u2019s grin was nothing short of shit-eating. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shot off the bench and loomed over him, hands on hips. \u201cAdrien Agreste, if you think that being cute is going to help you\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He leaned forward, daring her to back away. \u201cYou think I\u2019m cute?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible for Marinette to blush any harder, but she was managing. He opened his mouth to give her more crap \u2014 it was just too easy, whether he was in or out of cat ears \u2014 when she grabbed the back of his blonde head and yanked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery,\u201d she said, her voice threatening and low. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien stared up at her, his head back awkwardly, hands glued to the bench. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ohshitohshitohshit, is she going to \u2014 holy what, she\u2019s going to KISS M\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But at the last moment, her cheeks still glowing in the dark, Marinette pecked his cheek. The most harmless, butterfly-soft brush of lips. She backed away immediately, dropping her hand from his hair. She grabbed her empty paper cup and walked hurriedly to the nearest trash can.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat. What, what, <em>what</em> you don\u2019t get to just\u2026 walk </span>\n<em>\n<span>away </span>\n</em>\n<span>after that!\u201d Adrien spluttered. He scrambled off the bench and was behind her in two seconds.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette wasn\u2019t turning around. Frankly, he wasn\u2019t certain he knew how to face her. She\u2019d nearly kissed him, </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>kissed him. It was such a heady mix of Ladybug and Marinette that Adrien didn\u2019t have any idea which way was up anymore. He settled for a breathless, \u201cWhat was<em>that</em>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Ugh.</em>\u201d Marinette buried her face in her gloves. \u201cThis\u2026 is going to take some getting used to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien blinked, then laughed. \u201cA little. Maybe.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She turned around. Looked up at him with pursed lips and crossed arms. \u201cKind of a weird date, kitty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think so?\u201d he asked, a touch nervous. \u201cI mean, I can see why you\u2019d say that, but I really sort of thought\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A shriek ripped through the cold night air, and Adrien and Marinette grabbed for each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the\u2014!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you hear\u2014?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>A Christmas tree-topper angel, the size of a two-story building, lurched down the street, ripping off strings of lights from trees and posts as it went. Enormous wings crushed awnings, a plastic hand smashed windows, and a painted mouth opened wide to shriek, \u201c\u2018Tis the season, HEARTBREAKERS! Come out, come out, wherever you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>The angel heaved itself closer to the skating rink, cackling all the way. \u201cHeartbreakers!\u201d the angel continued to scream, pointing at a couple holding each other tightly on the ice. A wave of a plastic hand, a <em>pop!</em>, and the two skaters transformed into two glass holiday ornaments, rolling on the ice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>What</em> do you think you two are doing?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien dragged his attention from the skating rink, his arms still wrapped around Marinette, to focus on Tikki and Plagg flying toward them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlagg!\u201d Never mind a scorned tree-topper wreaking havoc on the neighborhood, Adrien couldn\u2019t stop his huge grin. \u201cHave you been following us?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew </span>\n</em>\n<span>that story about feeling bad was crap.\u201d Marinette narrowed her eyes at Tikki. \u201cCan kwamis even get sick?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho cares about that now?\u201d Tikki scolded. \u201cAre you </span>\n<em>\n<span>aware </span>\n</em>\n<span>you\u2019ve got a house-sized akuma blundering around behind you?! Transform! Now!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, </span>\n<em>\n<span>here?</span></em>\u201d Marinette choked.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien caught her eye and grinned shamelessly. \u201cAw, what\u2019s there to hide now, my lady?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, </span>\n<em>\n<span>well</span></em>,\u201d she spluttered. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as getting used to an idea gradually!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He grabbed her hand and pointed his other fist at the sky. \u201cPlagg! Transform!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette gaped at him as he felt Chat Noir\u2019s magic sweep over him from head to toe. He smirked behind his mask, and it was too easy to wink at her like he always did. \u201cWhat if I promised not to look?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She flushed, and Adrien forgot about the akumatized angel. He forgot that Tikki was still tapping her little red foot angrily in thin air. He forgot he was Chat Noir. All he knew was that <em>here</em> was Marinette\u2019s wide-eyed, tiny smile. Here she was, looking at </span>\n<em>\n<span>him </span>\n</em>\n<span>like </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span></em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His heart sped up before he registered what was happening. She rested her free hand on his shoulder. Stood on her tiptoes. Adrien just managed to tilt his head to one side for the best angle as she kissed him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She tasted like hot chocolate with chili pepper. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If this was what that damn drink was supposed to taste like.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sign him up for a gallon. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, <em>now</em> you do this?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien opened one eye to catch Tikki hovering above them. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this, like </span>\n<em>\n<span>at all</span></em>! Akuma at two o\u2019clock, let\u2019s go, go, go!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette broke off the kiss (<em>boo</em>). \u201cOkay, all right, yes, wow. Tikki!\u201d She brushed her hair back from her earrings. \u201cTransform me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien dropped Marinette\u2019s\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ladybug\u2019s</span>\n</em>\n<span> hand as golden glitter covered her. He stepped back, watching her transform for the second time in his life. Her black hair spiraled around her, and that familiar red mask settled over his favorite blue eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I don\u2019t think.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019ll </span>\n</em>\n<span>ever </span>\n<em>\n<span>get used to this.</span>\n</em>\n</p>"
