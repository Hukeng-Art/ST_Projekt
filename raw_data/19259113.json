  "notes": "<p>I'm officially on a Merlin kick. I'm rewatching the series and everything. I find it tragic that there wasn't more of a focus on Emrys. It was such an opportunity for an even more badass Merlin...Or teasing Merlin. Relentlessly.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>At some point I shall finish all my other WIP and then...I might wanna try an angsty Merlin fic. That would be a lot of fun lol. Thanks for reading!</p>",
  "text": "<p>Merlin was so tired.</p>\n<p>Physically, emotionally, mentally \u2013 he was just tired. He had enough. There had to be some kind of magical spell that just paused time. He really needed to learn it</p>\n<p>At some point since the woman had revealed herself to be a sorceress and explained she served the \u2018mighty and great Emrys\u2019, Merlin had been pushed in the middle of all the knights. It would have been sweet if it wasn\u2019t so inconvenient. Adeptly, he managed to duck under Gwaine\u2019s arm so he had a better reach in case the woman decided to attack. From Arthur\u2019s side, Lancelot rose an eyebrow at him. Merlin shrugged before gesturing towards the cloaked figure who was chanting under her breath.</p>\n<p>The woman smiled smugly, eyes flickering between the knights as she tipped her head back and looked at the sky. After a few deep breaths she let her gaze move back down to them, a smile stretching over her lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys has called for your death.\u201d She announced, her voice thick with some kind of bravo accent, and Arthur\u2019s hands fluttered to the hilt of his sword, not answering. Merlin had other ideas. He ignored Leon trying to yank him back and stepped out in front of her, crossing his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo he hasn\u2019t.\u201d The servant rolled his eyes and everyone froze. The woman blinked at him, her head tilting to the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 yes he has.\u201d She frowned, her accent faltering. She took another deep breath before turning back to the dramatics \u201cHe just spoke to me,\u201d She jutted out her chin \u201cAs a creature of magic I can hear his voice-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d Merlin interrupted stubbornly \u201cOnly druids can speak to Emrys and you aren\u2019t a druid.\u201d He said, keeping his voice flat and unimpressed. \u201cYou\u2019re a fake. Do you even <em>have</em> magic?\u201d He asked, watching as the woman stared at him, mouth slightly agape.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d She snapped \u201cYou anger him \u2013 I have been a trusted ally to Emrys for many years and you have the <em>audacity</em> to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know who Emrys was if he was standing right in front of you.\u201d Merlin told her and from beside Arthur, Lancelot coughed. A few knights shot him a puzzled glance as the man cleared his throat and straightened himself. Humor danced in his eyes. The woman stared.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\u201d She finally demanded, slowly lowering her arms. Merlin considered. While it <em>would</em> be fun reveal himself in this manner, but he knew now wasn\u2019t the time. Not if he wanted his head on his shoulders and Arthur to live for a few more years. So instead he shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are <em>you</em>? Cause I know you don\u2019t have a magical bone in your body. Your plan is just to scare us so we leave you alone. A bad decision really because all of these men would run you through the second you pretended to use sorcery.\u201d He told her and watched as the woman continued to stare. \u201cIf you tell them why you want us gone so badly they <em>could</em> help you, you know.\u201d He finished with a vague gesture to where the knights were watching the interaction with varying expressions. Percival lowered his sword.</p>\n<p>For a second, nobody said anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d She finally asked, her voice losing the gaudy accent. Merlin smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall it intuition.\u201d\u00a0 He told her. From the crowd of knights behind him, Gwaine stuck his sword into the ground and cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention.</p>\n<p>\"Who the fuck is Emrys?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nobody.\" Merlin said - perhaps too quickly. Elyan rose a brow at him. Giving a weak laugh, Merlin tried to find a way to cover his tracks. \"He's, well, he's kind of a sorcerer.\" He admitted. Before he could defend himself for knowing too much about something definitely illegal to know about, the woman gasped.</p>\n<p>\"You don't <em>know</em> who Emrys is?\" She demanded. Merlin turned to her. He wished for a moment that she was a druid so he could telepathically beg her not to say anything Merlin would regret the knights hearing. \"He's only the most powerful sorcerer known to the world.\" She said, planting a hand on her hip in disapproval at Gwaine's lack of knowledge. \"They say after years of prophecy he finally roams the Earth. \"His abilities are unequal to any-\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know about that...\" Merlin murmured, ignoring Lancelot slowly turning to him.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I do.\" The woman insisted and grabbed his hands \"You know of him! Have you seen him? Have you felt his powers?\" She asked, her hold tightening on him. Merlin tried to squirm out of her grip to no avail. \"What I would give to even touch him...\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure he feels like a normal person-\"</p>\n<p>\"No. No, he would feel...<em>Wonderful.</em>\" She sighed, eyes dreamily flickering to the sky. He took her moment of distraction to yank himself away. Weird. This was <em>weird</em>...And he was also definitely getting beheaded. Nervously, he turned to Arthur to find him only rolling his eyes as he gestured for his men to gather their supplies and ready the horses.</p>\n<p>Well. Maybe Arthur was finally accepting that Merlin was well informed of things that he shouldn't be... Or he had stopped listening about halfway through the conversation. The second was more admittedly more likely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was\u2026Interesting.\u201d Elyan said as they made their way home.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean <em>awesome</em>!\u201d Gwaine crowed and trotted his horse up next to Merlin\u2019s \u201cYou totally called her out. How did you know?\u201d He demanded and Merlin caught Lancelot\u2019s grin before chuckling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d He shrugged \u201cIntuition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gwaine whined that intuition didn\u2019t count as a real answer while Leon sought to find a way to keep him quiet. Lancelot pulled up beside Merlin and leaned in.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo people <em>normally</em> call Emrys the most powerful sorcerer to walk the earth?\u201d He asked quietly and Merlin groaned. He told Lancelot most of his magical life during late nights in Camelot, whispering by smoldering fires and ill lit rooms. He was a good friend. Sometimes it felt like Merlin\u2019s only <em>real</em> friend. As far as he knew everyone else might chop his head off within three seconds of finding out who he really was.</p>\n<p>Well. Maybe not Gwaine. He smiled fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d He grumbled to Lancelot \u201cNobody knows if it is actually true.\u201d</p>\n<p>The knight laughed, looking pleased by the answer. He glanced back at where Arthur was watching them, lips pursed and jaw set. Normally, the prince led the group as per custom, but for some reason he insisted on being in the very back. Merlin could only assume he felt the danger was behind them instead of in front.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I look forward to hear what other magical creatures have to say on the matter.\u201d Lancelot said, eyes sparkling with mischief. Merlin sighed. Hopefully they wouldn\u2019t run across anyone who is familiar with the name \u2018Emrys\u2019 for a long, long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I have heard tales of Emrys,\u201d The old man told them and Lancelot wasted no time shooting Merlin a bright look. Arthur tilted his head at the man, nodding for him to continue. \u201cHe was born of magic. It is said the magic spilled during the Great Purge followed a man fleeing from Uther\u2019s realm and led him to a beautiful woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin got the feeling he was about to feel very, very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice,\u201d Gwaine grinned \u201cSo Emrys\u2019 mom was a looker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seriously. Merlin did not deserve this.</p>\n<p>\u201cRumors have it that the passion between the man and woman led to such pleasure that the entire magical community momentarily rejoiced despite the war because they knew such lust and love would lead to their savior and the Once and Future King.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop this.\u201d Merlin whispered and Lancelot clapped his shoulder with a grimace.</p>\n<p>A different woman told them how Emrys\u2019 powers were tied to nature. Someone else mentioned how his power was given by the gods to protect the Once and Future King.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard his first love was the Lady of the Lake.\u201d One man told them as he skinned a rabbit \u201cRumor has it they met briefly before she died. He buried her in the Lake of Avalon and there she resides, waiting to repay him for his kindness and love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you hear <em>that</em>?\u201d Merlin demanded, feeling hot. Nobody could have possibly known\u2026 It was so specific and accurate he wondered if he had a spy watching him. The man paused in his skinning to look at Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brother spoke to the Lady of the Lake.\u201d He said seriously \u201cShe helped him once when he prayed to her. She\u2019s supposed to be <em>beautiful</em>. Dark hair and eyes that\u2019ll melt your soul. And her-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d Merlin interrupted again. So apparently Freya was spreading his story. He wondered if she was simply reminiscent or she purposely fed people tales about him. Knowing his old love she might be trying to pry him out of the shadows. He wouldn\u2019t put it past her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas he right?\u201d Lancelot asked later \u201cAre you a consort to a goddess?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t realized it, but she was a goddess, wasn\u2019t she? He gave a meager shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I was. Can\u2019t really be anything to her since she\u2019s dead.\u201d He muttered and Lancelot gave a sympathetic smile before bumping his shoulder. Merlin looked over to see Arthur watching them again. Did he suspect something?</p>\n<p>Merlin felt his throat tighten at the thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dragonlord?\u201d Arthur asked, looking at the man who was nodding eagerly. \u201cI thought Balinor was the last of the dragonlords.\u201d He began and the man paused at the name, wrinkling his nose. Merlin waited for him to admit the truth to the statement, but the man only jutted out his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Emrys </em>is the last dragonlord.\u201d He snapped out and Merlin had to physically pinch himself to keep from screaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026You\u2019re Emrys?\u201d Elyan asked, raising a brow. The man shrugged. Merlin looked over to where Lancelot was grinning at him. The man in question looked absolutely nothing like Emrys (aka Merlin). There was also the fact that he was hanging upside from a tree branch.</p>\n<p>\u2026okay, that might be something Merlin would accidentally get himself into, but not the point.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet yourself out then,\u201d Merlin sighed and everyone turned to him \u201cThis bloody Emrys is apparently magical and now a dragonlord. If you are him then get yourself out.\u201d He pointed out. Percival shrugged in agreement, raising his sword to subtly poke at the man hanging.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I am having an off day.\u201d The man tried and Merlin stared. \u201cWhat? You wouldn\u2019t know nothing about it.\u201d He said and looked off into the distance \u201cThey say Emrys tamed the great dragon of Camelot and sired the white dragon of Albion-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSired?\u201d Gwaine interrupted \u201cThis Emrys fellow is going around siring dragons? How exactly is that happening? Sex with other dragons?\u201d He asked and despite the situation, Merlin flushed. The man blinked, looking equally baffled by the question. From the corner of his eye, Merlin could see Arthur pinching the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026I actually don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re Emrys,\u201d Merlin reminded him with a sigh \u201cYou don\u2019t remember siring any dragons?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>said</em> it was an off day!\u201d He complained, trying to cross his arms despite being upside down. Merlin took a long breath. Lancelot had already walked away, but that did nothing to hide his howling laughter. Merlin supposed the scenario was funny enough that nobody else questioned it.</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>dragon</em>?\u201d The knight asked when Merlin walked over to kick him. \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>! I mean\u2026The siring the dragon bit is <em>technically</em> true, but-\u201d He started and hit him again when the laughter started back up \u201cI just hatched the bloody egg! I didn\u2019t have sex with anything! Lancelot\u2026Lancelot <em>stop it</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, hello Emrys.\u201d</p>\n<p>The group froze at the greeting from the elderly blind woman. She smiled brightly at them all, having been picking berries when they crossed her.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an elf.\u201d Gwaine whispered, pointing at her ears. He was right, Merlin was pretty sure. Unless there were other creatures that had pointed ears and only went up to your shoulders \u2013 or maybe the woman was simply short. Who knows? Not Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed I am, child.\u201d The woman said, clearing up any questions on the species front. Gwaine\u2019s grin grew wider, eyes flickering to the rest in excitement at the revelation. Arthur sighed, shaking his head at the knight before turning back to the woman, lips pursed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just call us Emrys?\u201d He asked and Merlin didn\u2019t miss the way his hand flittered to his sword. He held his breath, praying he wasn\u2019t about to get stabbed because a blind elf somehow recognized him and didn\u2019t realize the imminent danger.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d The elf said \u201cI called <em>Emrys,</em> Emrys. Do keep up.\u201d She said and Lancelot shifted a bit towards Merlin as she spoke. Merlin tried to tell her telepathically to shut it, but he had no idea if she heard him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys is here?\u201d Arthur asked, voice rising a pitch higher. The woman stopped her berry picking, instead turning her white eyes directly onto Arthur, somehow pinpointing where he was and turning to him. For a second she said nothing, simply standing there in a way that made everyone shift nervously. Merlin held his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou frighten him,\u201d She finally frowned \u201cThough I can\u2019t imagine why. He could turn you to dust with a wave of his \u2013 Oh. I see.\u201d She interrupted herself \u201cHe cares a great deal for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arthur blinked, taking the smallest of steps back. \u201cHow\u2026? How do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy child, I cannot see, but I can still sense magical presences and understand the stories they are telling. Emrys\u2019 magic is hard to miss. It is quite protective of you, dear. Not surprising given the prophecy, but I sense Emrys himself has grown fond of you.\u201d She smiled \u201cProphecies can push people together, but they can\u2019t force emotions.\u201d She said and Merlin felt his face heat up a little at that. He wasn\u2019t sure what she was implying, but judging by the look Lancelot was giving him, the other knight did.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why is he frightened of me?\u201d Arthur scowled \u201cIf he cares so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody likes rejection, darling.\u201d The elf sighed \u201cNow, I believe you have come into this forest looking for a relic of the Old Religion, hm? It is over in the old castle near the bank of the river.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Emrys-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust follow the trail and you\u2019ll get there by sundown.\u201d She finished and plucked another berry from the bush. They tried talking to her for a few more minutes, but she didn\u2019t speak again. Arthur eventually gave up and grumbled to himself as he marched past, ignoring her humming.</p>\n<p><em>Be brave,</em> a voice echoed in his head and Merlin almost dropped the pack he was carrying. The woman had turned to look directly at him. For a second, his breath caught. He felt his magic twist uncomfortably at his words, a bit offended. Merlin was born brave. He never had the <em>choice</em> to be a coward. He often wonders if he did have the choice, if he would be a coward. If he was born normally, would he ever have ever even touched magic? He swallowed a bit of resentment down and turned away. Even if he was acting cowardly, he figured he had earned that right.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like this Emrys fellow has a crush on you, Arthur!\u201d Gwaine yelled as they walked down the trail the woman had pointed out and Merlin immediately almost tripped.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s magic!\u201d Percival (his <em>hero,</em> bless him) called \u201cWhy would anyone with magic have a crush on Arthur?\u201d He reasoned. Merlin wanted to ask why <em>anyone</em> would have a crush on Arthur, but Leon interrupted with a hum from his place next to the king\u2019s side. He looked at Arthur with some consideration before turning back to the others.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys already was in love with that lake woman-\u201d He began, but stopped when Lancelot clapped his hands together.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy friends,\u201d He called and Merlin could have sighed in relief that someone was <em>finally</em> going to change the subject. \u201cHave we considered that Emrys doesn\u2019t <em>know</em> he has such feelings for our king?\u201d He asked, holding out his arms with a small wink at Merlin.</p>\n<p>What a fucking traitor.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys doesn\u2019t like Arthur,\u201d Merlin interjected, crossing his arms with a sharp glare towards Lancelot. \u201cThe elf was <em>clearly</em> insane if she\u2019s talking to the guy when he clearly isn\u2019t even here\u2026 Besides, Arthur is a prat.\u201d He added on for good measure. Percival shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, good,\u201d Arthur declared \u2013 speaking for the first time since this mess of a conversation started. \u201cBecause I certainly do not have a crush on Emrys\u2026Whoever the Hell he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin knew it was kind of silly to be offended\u2026but also. How dare he?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Right, right.\" Gwaine snorted \"We forget someone has already snagged our king's heart.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys is too good for you anyways.\u201d Merlin sniffed before he could help himself. In fairness, Gwen was out of Arthur's league too. \u201cHe probably likes people who have a smaller head\u2026and waist.\u201d He added just to make sure Arthur was thoroughly annoyed. Sure enough, the king threw his waterskin at Merlin\u2019s head a few moments later.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin let it <em>go</em>,\u201d Arthur sighed as the druid girl tilted her head, giving a slight nod of apology as she bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>Emrys</em>. At this point I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin looked at him and then back to where the druid girl was silently crushing her berries in a bowl. He turned around, seeing the knights each watching him with various expressions of boredom. They didn\u2019t even look <em>shocked</em>. He turned around again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said and shook his head \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The girl squeaked, stopping her progression with the berries to look at him. \u201cBut the legends do say Emrys is immortal.\u201d She began and trailed off when Merlin wrinkled his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe legends are stupid.\u201d He decided \u201cEmrys <em>can\u2019t</em> be immortal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Leon asked, voice gentle despite the fact this had been a ten-minute argument now. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be immortal? He\u2019s supposed to be the most powerful sorcerer to live, Merlin. Surely he can-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nobody</em> is bloody immortal. And if Emrys is a real person than he, of all people, should not be immortal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is quite powerful-\u201d The girl began, but Merlin was not having it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that must be very stressful!\u201d He said, throwing his arms out in frustration. \u201cThe man is out there with a whole destiny apparently and is probably very tired and worried and anxious.\u201d Merlin said stubbornly \u201cIt is <em>mean</em> to make him live forever!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t sound like the Emrys, I know.\u201d Gwaine said and Merlin turned to him, mouth gaping.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Emrys <em>you know</em>?\u201d He repeated, trying not to scream at the ridiculousness. Gwaine hummed in agreement, throwing his apple to the side in order to gesture in front of him, framing the sky with his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys is\u2026Calm. Tranquil. Like an angel in the clouds watching Arthur from afar\u2026Refusing to admit his crush.\u201d He explained and looked towards the other knights. Percival was nodding in agreement while Elyan put a hand under his chin before shrugging and giving Gwaine a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>For the love of all that was good in this world\u2026Merlin took a long breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <em>know</em> him, Gwaine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHim and I have a connection,\u201d Gwaine insisted \u201cI think if we met we would be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin wasn't sure how Gwaine was alive if he was just openly admitting he would be friends with a sorcerer...Then again, it was only yesterday that Gwaine very loudly declared that if Arthur didn't confess his love for a certain servant that Lancelot was going to beat him there... So clearly he had no concerns about living or dying at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026Fine. You would be friends. But he isn\u2019t immortal.\u201d Merlin said and the druid grimaced. \u201cCome <em>on</em>. You\u2019re going to make the poor guy deal with life for the rest of time?\u201d He asked, a little desperately. She shot him another look of apology.</p>\n<p><em>I am only the messenger, </em>she said in his head. Merlin stared. This is ridiculous. Arthur tugged him away, muttering under his breath that Merlin cared far too much about inane things.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Are you certain I\u2019m immortal?</em>\n</p>\n<p>The girl watched as he was dragged away with a small wave as his answer.</p>\n<p>Two hours later, Lancelot found him sitting in the grass, picking bitterly at the ground. They both just waited for a moment \u2013 unwilling to ruin the silence. Finally, the knight gingerly lowered himself next to the servant.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Merlin.\u201d He said quietly. \u201cI know you wanted to see your loved ones in Avalon again.\u201d He told him quietly and Merlin sighed, letting the tension that had been eating at him begin to slip away as his friend said the words he had been trying to avoid thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill I have to watch Arthur die?\u201d He asked and Lancelot swallowed, reaching out to clasp his arm gently as answer. More silence followed and unwilling to deprive himself another moment of wallowing in self-pity he launched himself at the other knight, hugging him tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s immortal too,\u201d Lancelot said gently \u201cThen you could both pretend like you aren\u2019t head over heels for each other for all of eternity-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll that talk of you being noble is horseshit, Lancelot. I know you just want Gwen to yourself.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Merlin!</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin would like to momentarily pause time to point out that he had never \u2013 not even <em>once</em> \u2013 did <em>anything</em> to deserve something like this. Never. He was a good man. He was doing good deeds and sought no reward other than Arthur\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p>So why <em>was this happening</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys and the priestess Nimueh had a torrid love affair-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Merlin interrupted the woman \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is!\u201d She insisted, turning to Arthur and the rest of the knights \u201cRumor even says they had a <em>child</em> together-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s even less true.\u201d Merlin shrugged, jutting his hands in his pockets and glowered. The woman crossed her arms over her chest. Lancelot was looking between the two, face pinched in uncertainty as he seemingly attempted to figure out what course of action to take next.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what would you know of it, Merlin?\u201d Arthur asked, exasperation hinting at tone as he tucked his sword away \u201cNimueh is an enemy of Camelot. Is Emrys still aligned with her?\u201d He asked, and Merlin had to take a moment to remind himself that only he had knowledge of the witch\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 No, he killed her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026Or not.</p>\n<p>The woman sighed as if it was a dream ruined that Merlin hadn\u2019t lived and long, loving life with that psychopath. \u201cShe tried to harm the Once and Future King and <em>everyone</em> knows Emrys\u2019 love for him is far greater than for anyone else.\u201d She noted and Merlin sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis warlock is in <em>love with me</em>?\u201d Arthur asked, sounding astounded. Despite everything, Merlin flushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCalled it.\u201d Gwaine muttered and Elyan wrinkled his nose as he reached to his belt to hand over a sack of coins. Merlin might have found it in himself to be affronted by that display if he wasn\u2019t more concerned with the other conversation happening right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the Hell said <em>you</em> were the Once and Future King?\u201d He snapped, crossing his arms over his chest. Percival raised his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cA druid did,\u201d He said and when Merlin stared, shrugged \u201cYou were sick.\u201d He added and Merlin squinted until his mind jumped back to when he had been poisoned a few weeks earlier by one of Arthur\u2019s enemies. \u201cThe druid told us Arthur was the once and future king and that Emrys was also beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026.what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Gwaine shrugged \u201cI guess it isn\u2019t a surprise since his mom was supposed to be a hot piece of ass, but the druid did mention he was a beauty to behold\u2026which is good news for our princess!\u201d He added, clapping Arthur on the back \u201cAt least you know a beautiful man has eyes for you.\u201d He chirped.</p>\n<p>\"But Arthur has eyes for someone else even more beautiful!\" Elyan called. Merlin might have thought that was a little strange considering the knight wasn't the biggest fan of Gwen and Arthur together, but he was too busy very slowly turning to Lancelot to think much of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026Sorry I didn\u2019t mention that,\u201d The knight whispered \u201cI thought you might be embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>None of this is true</em>!\u201d Merlin hissed back. He <em>hadn\u2019t</em> been in love with Nimueh, he <em>hadn\u2019t</em> had a child with her certainly, and he <em>wasn\u2019t</em> in love with Arthur!</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that Merlin.\u201d Lancelot told him, clapping his arm \u201cI think you are quite beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you hate me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes truth seems more abstract the more you lie. If you tell yourself the same lie over and over again, eventually the truth seems unreal and foreign. You lose your grounding and when things circle back around, reality hits you with a force you can\u2019t defend yourself against.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not druids.\u201d Merlin noted calmly, the rope reddening his skin and he continued trying to unknot himself from the tree \u201cBut you serve Emrys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know of the prophecy.\u201d The girl said, not tearing her eyes from Arthur. Him and the knights were in chains opposed from Merlin\u2019s meager ropes. An unwise decision really. The iron claps were their only chance at ensuring their safety from Emrys himself. \u201cEmrys is said to serve the Once and Future King-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes. I know. But if you serve Emrys why did you tie the Once and Future King up?\u201d He argued impatiently. Elyan was hissing at him to be quiet, concern flitting across everyone\u2019s faces at Merlin\u2019s impatience. The servant had already had enough. Ever since the name \u2018Emrys\u2019 had entered Camelot\u2019s walls Merlin had received nothing but grief. So many rumors and prophecies that he couldn\u2019t even give comment to without risk of exposing himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Emrys</em> chooses who the Once and Future King is.\u201d The girl snapped as her brother aimed a swift kick at Merlin\u2019s legs as he passed. He hissed in annoyance, but didn\u2019t interrupt the girl \u201cWe are keeping Emrys from choosing <em>him</em>.\u201d She added with a jerk of her head towards Arthur. Merlin felt his ire rise, a growl bubbling in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026Offensive. Even if Emrys <em>did</em> choose the Once and Future King, which I don\u2019t think he does, shouldn\u2019t you trust his judgment?\u201d He asked and felt a stab of relief when the knot tying his hands together loosened. \u201cBesides, why don\u2019t you just talk to Emrys about your concerns?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl and her brother exchange wary glances. They muttered something and Merlin rolled his eyes, asking them to repeat themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t <em>know</em> who he is.\u201d The boy snapped. Merlin sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour plan is really stupid.\u201d He said and the ropes fell off of him as he undid the final knot. The boy moved towards him, but Merlin held up a hand. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m helping you by escaping. As it happens, I know Emrys. He would not be a fan of this.\u201d He added and the pair stuttered out their disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a druid!\u201d The girl growled \u201cWe checked \u2013 none of you bear druid markings.\u201d She told him and Merlin tried to think of a way he could get them out of his way without using magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said I was a druid.\u201d He answered and held out his hand \u201cCould I have the key to their handcuffs please?\u201d He asked, offering a polite smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you-? No!\u201d The girl yelled and rose her hand \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough from you.\u201d she said and started chanting. Merlin flicked his wrist, silencing her. Discretion was over.</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny. I was going to say the same thing.\u201d He told her. The girl was clutching at her throat, opening her mouth in a desperate attempt to speak. Her brother was frozen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sorcerer.\u201d He swallowed and Merlin tilted his head. He shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cKey?\u201d He asked. He potentially could free them all with magic, but it would be painful and difficult since they were all in iron. The boy grabbed the key and pulled it closer to his chest, eyes flicking to his sister warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you protect the king?\u201d He asked instead \u201cHe kills our kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur is not the same as his father. He doesn\u2019t kill out of fear or cruelty. He <em>is</em> the Once and Future King, despite the actions you have taken to prevent it.\u201d He added bitterly \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you harm him so it would be much simpler if you handed me the key and swore fealty to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d The boy spat \u201cIf we kill him than he can\u2019t be the one the prophecies speak of-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how prophecies work. I know for a fact he is the one they speak of. I\u2019m losing my patience.\u201d Merlin warned. The girl had recovered from the shock of losing her voice and was now fumbling around for a weapon. Merlin hoped he didn\u2019t have to do anything dramatic to stop them from attacking.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe druids told me. And a dragon. And a seer\u2026 Really the list is endless.\u201d Merlin sighed and held out his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why is it your duty to protect him?\u201d The boy continued. Merlin knew he didn\u2019t really look all-powerful, but he was still kind of offended by the idiocy being displayed. He didn\u2019t risk looking at the knights to see if they had caught on. Merlin just stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026\u201d He trailed off and Merlin continued his staring.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d He said instead \u201cEveryone says the same thing. That I am so much younger than they expected or not as tall or as imposing or whatever. I really don\u2019t know what people think I\u2019m supposed to look like. An old man who lives in the forest with a bright light around me? Honestly. How am I supposed to protect anyone like that?\u201d He mused, admittedly losing track of his initial goal. \u201cOh, come on,\u201d He added when the boy shook his head \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. What other sorcerer do you think is stupid enough to be a personal servant to King bloody Arthur Pendragon of Camelot? Trust me, it wasn\u2019t my first choice either. I walked inside the citadel and the first thing I saw was a beheading. I would have left immediately if the dragon didn\u2019t trick me into staying with all that destiny nonsense. Can I please have the key now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re really Emrys?\u201d The boy whispered. His sister had dropped the knife she had found to spear him with, mouth opened and face contorted in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Key?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 Arthur Pendragon really will unite Albion and bring back magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really up to him. I\u2019m just here to make sure he\u2019s safe and protect Camelot. Can we talk about the key now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the most powerful warlock to walk the earth!\u201d The boy protested, his sister nodding eagerly beside him \u201cSurely, you can take the throne yourself? Or force him to bring magic back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seriously? <em>Seriously</em>? Merlin groaned, lowering his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that? Arthur is my friend and I certainly do not want to be king. He\u2019ll do a fantastic job and I trust the decisions he makes. If he brings magic back, he\u2019ll do it in the best way and be honorable and all that. He can\u2019t do <em>anything</em> though if he\u2019s chained up so please, <em>please</em> give me the key before I knock you both out and take it from you. I\u2019m really at the end of my rope here, guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Right. Sorry.\u201d The boy asked and held it out to him. Merlin sighed, flicking his wrist to the girl\u2019s voice was restored and took the metal key from them. \u201cWere you serious about before? About swearing fealty to Camelot?\u201d He added and Merlin raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say you serve Emrys?\u201d He asked and both nodded \u201cThen, yes. If you serve me, you serve Arthur and Camelot. Welcome.\u201d He added dryly. He finally turned to the knights. He wasn\u2019t for sure what reaction he would receive, but most of the expressions were fairly blank. Lancelot was smiling at him, the pride unmistakable. Gwaine was giddily grinning as well, face alight with pleasure at the revelation. The rest were harder to read. From behind him, the siblings knelt, muttering their oaths. Arthur was watching them with a little annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I, uh. Let you out will you promise to let me explain before you kill me?\u201d He asked. Arthur\u2019s eyes snapped up to him and \u2013 yep. There was the anger he was expecting. For a second there was only silence and Merlin figured he was safe to let Lancelot out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d His friend asked when Merlin released him. He shook his head and moved towards Gwaine. The knight had wisely not spoken, despite the clear excitement he was vibrating with. Merlin shook his head at him, hiding a smile of his own when he was pulled into a hug from the other man.</p>\n<p>\u201cSire?\u201d He asked warily, and Arthur took a long breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me out.\u201d He said lowly. Merlin frowned \u2013 it didn\u2019t sound very promising. From behind him, Lancelot and Gwaine shuffled. The brother and sister were peering over at them nervously. Merlin stepped forward and released him, moving towards Leon, Percival, and Elyan to unchain them as well.</p>\n<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026You\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the love of <em>God</em>. Before Merlin could even defend himself, Gwaine raised his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to know how you fuck a dragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question \u2013 but let\u2019s hear more about the pretty Lady of the Lake you apparently got with.\u201d Elyan started, rubbing his wrist now that the bindings we off \u201cAnd that torrid love affair with Nimueh. This is going to complicate things, your majesty. He\u2019s a player, clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Leon shook his head \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the fact he has a <em>kid</em>. Arthur, are you <em>really</em> ready to become a father?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTHE DRAGON IS THE KID! NIMUEH IS ACTUALLY THE DRAGON!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly <em>shit-</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d Merlin yelled, loudly enough to shut them up \u201cI <em>did not</em> have <em>any</em> feelings for Nimueh. At all. She was evil. I killed her. That\u2019s it.\u201d He pointed out and Lancelot, damn him, clicked his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause she threatened Arthur\u2019s life?\u201d He innocently questioned and Merlin looked up at the sky at the chortling that followed. He <em>hated</em> them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes \u2013 and I did <em>not</em> fuck a dragon. I just hatched the egg \u2013 No. Don\u2019t roll your eyes at me. I <em>didn\u2019t</em>!\u201d He said and looked at Arthur. This was not how he was expecting this conversation to go\u2026 At all. \u201cAren\u2019t you pissed? Shouldn\u2019t you be planning to behead me?\u201d He added. It was a bit of a shock that that was how he <em>wanted</em> the conversation to go at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026Sure.\u201d He admitted \u201cIt is rather shocking to learn you slept with some lake lady-\u201d</p>\n<p>\"He's also immortal,\" Leon pointed out \"Beheading him might just mean you have a talking head following you around, sire.\" The knight said and Arthur rose his eyebrows at that, eyes flicking Merlin over at that.</p>\n<p>\"...is that not what's happening now?\" He asked with a roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did I even <em>bother</em> keeping you alive?\u201d Merlin hissed, face going bright red. Before he could realize that question was a huge mistake, Percival jumped in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you do love him-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em> kill me, Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was perhaps a month later when Arthur walked in to find a bunch of druids casually stuffed into his room, surrounding Merlin who was eagerly taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"...no, no. I need it more...dramatic than that.\" Merlin was saying as Arthur loudly shut the door to announce his presence.</p>\n<p>\"Merlin.\" He greeted and stared at the cloaked group sitting on his bedroom floor. \"Druids.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your majesty,\" They all murmured with bowed heads in return \"We are answering some questions that Emrys has regarding your prophecy.\" One of them chipped on. Arthur turned back to the sorcerer, not even bothering to voice his question. He just stared, waiting for Merlin to get it out.</p>\n<p>\"The prophecy says your an idiot.\" He finally burst out. Arthur might have been offended if he actually believed him. It was only when one of the druids shrugged that he let his mouth drop in betrayal. Merlin smirked as he leaned back in victory from his spot at Arthur's desk.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" One druid jumped in \"Technically the prophecy says that the Once and Future King would fail without your guidance.\" She explained, shifting from where she - was she sitting on Arthur's bed? Nevermind. Arthur had bigger problems at the moment.</p>\n<p>\"So he's an idiot,\" Merlin rectified and the king took a long breath. \"Anything else about the Once and Future King?\"</p>\n<p>At one point in his life he might have had a lot more to say on this matter. His servant turned sorcerer using his room as his own to house ex-criminals and insult the king... His father was probably rolling in his grave somewhere. As it was, Arthur knew that this was one of those rare situations where speaking would only add more problems.</p>\n<p>Plus he just knew Merlin was going to make a mess of things and very much wanted to see that.</p>\n<p>\"Uh...\" A druid boy piped up, taking a piece of fruit of Arthur's table \"It is said he is a servant to his people as his people are to him...Oh and that his love will guide the way to Albion.\" He continued, taking a bit of the fruit and wiping the juice from his chin. Merlin blinked.</p>\n<p>\"Gwen leads him to Albion?\" Merlin asked and pulled his brows together, voice going a little huffy \"That was <em>my</em> job.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is your job.\" The first druid said and there was a long moment of silence. Eventually Merlin must have gotten the implication because he flushed red, knocking over a bottle of ink as he muttered something about prophecies and lies. Arthur smiled. That was the mess\u00a0 he was waiting for.</p>\n<p>\"Really, Merlin,\" Arthur said as he opened his door back up. Training seemed like the better option right now anyways. \"You didn't have to go to the druids for a love confession. The knights have been saying it for months now...\" He sang and wrinkled his nose \"I was a little worried Lancelot might not have gotten the message. Luckily he's assured me he only has friendly feelings for you.\" He added with a shrug and there was a loud crash as he shut the door.</p>\n<p>\"...Emrys? Are you alright?\" A voice asked.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Come back here, you coward.\"<br>\n</em></p>"
