  "text": "<p>\n<span>relativity</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>/r\u025bl\u0259\u02c8t\u026av\u026ati/</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>noun</span>\n</em>\n<span>\n<br>\n</span>\n<span>the absence of standards of absolute and universal application.</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fate - the entity or the concept, Harry didn\u2019t much care which - had been screwing him over for as long as he could remember. In fact, even longer than that - it was probably giving him grief even in the womb.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was accustomed, by now, to bad fortune. Good things very rarely happened to him, and when they did, it was always preceded with something equally, if not more, terrible. He\u2019d thought, rather naively, he\u2019ll admit, that Cedric was as bad as it would get.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Watching an innocent, a </span>\n<em>\n<span>good</span>\n</em>\n<span> man that he\u2019d actually started to really like, die in front of him. To watch him be killed for absolutely no reason at all. It had been hard - almost devastating.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Harry had pulled through. He\u2019d survived the Dursley\u2019s, he\u2019d survived Quirrell, and a basilisk, and Voldemort himself. He could survive this, if only to kill the deranged bastard who\u2019d ended Cedric\u2019s life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then fifth year came and went - he\u2019d been subjected to humiliation, a smear campaign, and mild torture - with his godfathers death as a morbid grand finale.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry snorted to himself, and it was a harsh sound, not even a hint of a genuine laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t laugh much these days.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dead parents, a brain dead godmother and a </span>\n<em>\n<span>dead</span>\n</em>\n<span> dead godfather. He was cursed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Someone ought to warn Remus away, lest it decide to spread to honorary uncles too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d experienced all of that, and the worst part - truly - was the way he\u2019d been shipped back off to his relatives when it was all over. He should have known, after fourth year, but he\u2019d just </span>\n<em>\n<span>expected</span>\n</em>\n<span> the people he almost died for to give a damn after he\u2019d witnessed his godfather's death.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he\u2019d been shunned, for lack of a better word. Out of sight, and clearly out of mind. Like a toy soldier who\u2019d served his purpose, packed away until he could be used once more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Most of the time Harry just felt hollow.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everything - Petunia\u2019s shrieks, Dudley's gibes, his grief and sorrow and fury, his </span>\n<em>\n<span>life</span>\n</em>\n<span> - it just flowed through him like wind in tattered sails; enough to disturb him, but he was too damaged for it to have any great effect. Whenever it got too bad he\u2019d come here, to the rackety old swing set in the park, gently swaying until his thoughts stopped slipping through his fingers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was effective. The firm metal under his finger and the continuous motion serving as a way to anchor him. He could almost pretend to be content.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then the air changed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had his wand in his hand before he could take his next breath. He got to his feet slowly, carefully, making sure his base of support was stable and balanced. The swing set was built in an open clearing, no places to hide beside the line of tall shrubs; after checking behind him Harry allowed himself to slowly examine the shrubs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All the while, the air pressure dropped, ever so slightly, and the wind picked up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Directly in front of him, the plants shimmered. No, it wasn\u2019t the plants, but the shadows. Moving and twisting like they were somehow folding inwards despite being two dimensional.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A man stepped out from behind the shadows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry raised his wand, aiming at the man's chest, \u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>will</span>\n</em>\n<span> curse you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeace, Mr Potter.\u201d The man raised his hands in a placing gesture, \u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t move his wand, but his eyes tracked up and down the man\u2019s body. He was clad in a grey suit, an inky black tie, and a matching hat. He stepped no closer to Harry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI haven\u2019t lived this long by trusting strangers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man laughed, Harry\u2019s eyes flicked up to his face and found himself utterly unable to rest his eyes on any of his features. His face slipped and shifted, one moment a proud roman nose and the next he sported one that made him look rather similar to Snape. His eyes cycled from blue to green to black to brown, even his jawline shifted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAu contraire,\u201d The Man's voice startled him, and Harry resolved to stare at his tie instead of his face, \u201cI believe you\u2019ve trusted many a stranger. A half giant, perhaps?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Damn, the man had him there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHagrid hasn\u2019t tried to kill me, I have no reason to believe you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot on purpose he hasn\u2019t, but you must admit he has put you and yours in situations from which you might have lost your lives.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry almost growled, \u201cIrrelevant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho are you and what do you want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am an agent, Mr Potter. And i am here to deliver a message.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAn agent of Voldemort?\u201d Harry doubted it - no pureblood would be caught dead in a muggle suit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d The man said with a breezy laugh, \u201cI represent a third party. And we would like to give you a chance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA chance?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA chance at </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, at </span>\n<em>\n<span>living</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Mr Potter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry looked around incredulously, \u201cWhat the hell do you think i\u2019m doing now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome now, Mr Potter. This is not living. Your every action and choice has been controlled and manipulated since you were an infant. You cannot tell me it isn\u2019t starting to grate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry\u2019s silence was answer enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man hummed low in his throat, \u201cWhat has been done to you is despicable, we want to help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d It came out hoarse, \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>no one else does</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis war has harmed more than just you, Mr Potter. Should events play out as they will... we fear that the magical world might be nearing its end. The culture, traditions, all of it - it\u2019s disappearing day by day - moment by moment.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow?\u201d Harry asked, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>why</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe dark lord has brought death and destruction, Mr Potter. But it is the light lord that has doomed us all. Magic exists in balance. Light, grey, dark. In the last few decades the light has all but purged the dark, pushing the gray to the brink of extinction as well. But light magic cannot exist without the ambient energy that dark magic leaves behind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re running out of ambient energy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were.\u201d The man corrects, softly, \u201cThe dark lord\u2019s return sparked an uptick in the energy, but with the dark lord comes -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDeath and destruction.\u201d Harry finished.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, lowering his wand, \u201cSo, we\u2019re screwed either way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d The man stepped forward slowly, brandishing a globe no larger than a golf ball from his suit jacket, \u201cIt\u2019s far too late to stop the crusade against dark magic. Too much prejudice and too many bad memories. We acted too late to save this future, but there is still hope.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He held out the globe, which pulsated softly with a pale white light, \u201cWe can send you back five decades, give or take a few years. An identity, an entire life, is ready for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd how would that save the world?\u201d Harry asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou do not have to save the world, Mr Potter. Simply, Tom Riddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>What</span>\n</em>\n<span>?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is, was, and will be, an extraordinary wizard. As are you. You do not have to save him, I suppose. You could just as well kill him before he starts his war. But remember, Mr Potter, he is not what destroys the wizarding world.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDumbledore is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man bowed his head in acknowledgement, \u201cIndeed. Tom Riddle was a visionary, once. You have the chance to make sure he stays that way. It would be the best way to achieve your goal - that kind of charisma is hard to replicate, though I\u2019m sure you could do just as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, \u201cSuppose I go. How, exactly, did you set up a </span>\n<em>\n<span>life</span>\n</em>\n<span> for me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe simply sent a couple of agents back ahead of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd they couldn\u2019t complete this mission because?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man smiled, Harry couldn\u2019t exactly see it, but he knew all the same, \u201cSome things, Mr Potter, we must find out ourselves, rather than be told.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man dutifully ignored his eye roll, \u201cI assume you accept the offer?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure.\u201d Harry said after a moment of deliberation, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have much left to lose anyway.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d The man said, before tossing the globe in the air and stepping back into the shadows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry darted forward and grabbed the sphere out of the air, his seeker reflexes taking over.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The light brightened once, twice - and then it began to spread, leaking into his fingers and flowing up his arms following the line of his veins. Harry closed his eyes to stave off the brightness.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, he could no longer feel the ground under his feet or the wind blowing past him. Everything felt warm, and safe. The sensation was akin to a mouthful of slightly melted vanilla ice cream on a burning summer day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then it changed and his feet, soon followed by his entire body, was hitting the cold hard ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShould we wake him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbsolutely not, let the poor boy rest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, go put on a pot of tea, Vincent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s been a day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt took </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> a week to recover.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou only took a few hours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m special like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh look, Ronnie dear, i think he moved.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019ll be up soon, then. Best get everything prepared.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry groaned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everything - and he quite literally meant </span>\n<em>\n<span>everything</span>\n</em>\n<span> - hurt. It felt like every cell in his body had been put through the wringer, even fluttering his eyes opened caused a burst of pain to flare up in his forehead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A warm hand pressed on his cheek. Harry couldn\u2019t even muster up the energy to flinch away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes yet, dear.\u201d Someone said, \u201cI doubt he warned you, but the journey back will have you feeling a little under the weather for a few days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry managed a garbled reply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHush.\u201d They said and Harry had just enough coherent thought to note the southern drawl, \u201cSave your strength. Vincent is busy making chicken soup, doesn\u2019t that sound good?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That did sound good. Harry was sure he\u2019d made an appropriately agreeable sound, because the person laughed softly before moving away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was a nice laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next time Harry regained consciousness, everything hurt marginally less. Enough so that he could successfully open his eyes without giving himself brain damage. He tried to sit up, rather unsuccessfully, only managing to shove himself up slightly on his pillow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d been tucked snuggly into a bed, with three extra blankets and about a dozen pillows. Harry looked to the left, spotting his wand and a bowl of soup on the bedside table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh!\u201d came from the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry snapped his head to the sound, causing his neck to protest at the sudden movement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d The man said, smiling gently, \u201cRonnie! He\u2019s awake!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry winced at the noise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh dear.\u201d The man said quickly, \u201cSorry about that, we\u2019ll keep it down.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho\u2019r you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy name\u2019s Vincent, kiddo.\u201d The man sat down beside him, grabbing the bowl from the bedside table and offering him a spoonful, \u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned, promise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry, against his better judgement, opened his mouth. He\u2019d been unconscious for who knows how long in these peoples care. If they wanted to kill him, they\u2019d have done it by now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The soup was still warm, and delightfully filling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s good, right?\u201d Vincent smiled, \u201cMy mama\u2019s secret recipe.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s d\u2019ichious.\u201d He mumbled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWelcome back, dear.\u201d A woman walked into the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere, um, am I?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEast London,\u201d The woman sat down beside Vincent, \u201cIn nineteen forty-two.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry choked on his soup. He wasn\u2019t really sure why, he </span>\n<em>\n<span>had</span>\n</em>\n<span> agreed to this, but suddenly everything was hitting him. Everything he knew was </span>\n<em>\n<span>gone</span>\n</em>\n<span> - granted, most of that was shit, but still.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuck. What was that saying, again? The past is like a different country? He hadn't done </span>\n<em>\n<span>any</span>\n</em>\n<span> studying for this (and now he was starting to sound like Hermione, Merlin help him).\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent patted him gently on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shock to the system, we know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not prepared for this </span>\n<em>\n<span>at all</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Vincent said, \u201cMe and Ronnie've got you covered.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat Vince </span>\n<em>\n<span>means</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Ronnie said, smacking Vincent on the shoulder, \u201cIs that we have information packets, appropriate clothes, </span>\n<em>\n<span>and</span>\n</em>\n<span> forged transcripts. We have all summer to get you prepared for hogwarts.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said, \u201cOkay, so, who am I? Exactly?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadrian Peverell.\u201d Ronnie handed him a paper file, \u201cThe only son of Rhonda and Vincent Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blinked, \u201cYou\u2019re my\u2026?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour Parents, yes.\u201d She smiled slightly, \u201cAt least, in the official capacity.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent added, \u201cThough, we </span>\n<em>\n<span>are</span>\n</em>\n<span> responsible for taking care of you from now on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry opened the file and read through the pages. Whoever this third party was, they were thorough as hell. The files contained everything from his birth certificate to primary school detention transcriptions. Apparently his magical education thus far had been a combination of homeschooling and tutors, but his parents had decided to put him into a proper schooling environment for his O.W.L years - wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, I\u2019ve already done my fifth year.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ll be redoing them, dear. I believe you can do much better without several of your teachers deliberately sabotaging your education.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Harry said. What she had said made sense, so he wouldn\u2019t bother arguing it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you rest.\u201d Vincent said, standing up, \u201cTraining will start on Monday.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s saturday.\u201d Ronnie filled in before he could ask.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTraining?\u201d he squeaked instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent smiled, \u201cManners, etiquette, politics. Not to mention some extra tutoring in your academics. You are a scion of the Peverell house now, this will be expected of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, he should have known.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie patted him on the shoulder before standing up as well, \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright, Hadrian. We\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know. And a little extra too.\u201d She added with a wink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent and Ronnie left the room, taking the empty soup bowl but leaving the files for Harry to go through in more detail. He sighed again. The rest of his life, if it went anything like this, was going to be a fucking headache and a half.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry hated being right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d just started in on their twelve point study programme and he already had a headache. The magical world was just\u2026 so complex - way more than he\u2019d ever realised. Add that to the fact that he\u2019d been thrown five decades into the past. Well, Harry might as well have been raised on Mars with how little he knew about </span>\n<em>\n<span>anything</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie and Vince - they\u2019d both told him to call them whatever he felt comfortable with inside the house, though he\u2019d have to use Mother and Father in public to keep up appearances - were doing their best to ease him into things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first topic of discussion was social etiquette. Something that hadn\u2019t, apparently, fallen out of fashion even back - or forward? - in the nineties. He\u2019d just been too dense to realise that near everyone else was following a code of conduct. In his defence though, most people seemed to forget the term \u2018personal space\u2019 when it came to interacting with him, let alone deferring to etiquette rules.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Ronnie was explaining the different types of greeting, oblivious to Harry\u2019s internal freak out, \u201cYou are heir Perverell. Meaning you are on parr with Most ancient and Most noble houses like the Gryffindor or the Blacks. You would greet other heirs of these houses by gripping their wrists as an indication of equal status.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh huh.\u201d he said, scribbling it down in his notebook - thankfully Vince wasn\u2019t bothered with using parchment and quills, so he\u2019d nabbed a few pens and bullet journals at the store for Harry to use.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLords and ladies of ancient and noble houses, like the Malfoys, would also be seen as having equal status to the heirs of Most ancient and Most noble houses, so you would also greet them like that. The heirs to ancient and noble houses would bow, no lower than about a quarter of the way down, to you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie raised an eyebrow at him. Harry nodded in response. Vince ate another scone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then.\u201d She continued, \u201cSo folks with no status at all, this includes houses like the Weasleys and the Bones, as well as no-maj\u2019s, you\u2019d shake their hands. </span>\n<em>\n<span>They</span>\n</em>\n<span> would bow to ancient and noble houses.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said slowly, \u201cSo You clasp wrists with people of equal status, bow to one level of status about, and shake hands with two levels up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie nodded with a pleased smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo I would bow to the lords and Ladys of Most ancient and Most noble houses?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes!\u201d She cheered slightly, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, dear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled, \u201cSo how do I know who\u2019s who?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince smirked, pulling out a thick tome from the pile in front of them. \u201cYou\u2019re memorizing everyone of note.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry looked at the book with dawning horror, \u201cEveryone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone.\u201d They confirmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry couldn\u2019t contain his groan. \u201cRemind me again why this is necessary?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie leveled him with an impressive unimpressed look, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally start a blood feud, now would you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gulped, \u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie hummed at his reply before shoving the book of names and titles under his nose. \u201cRead up. We\u2019ll be testing you on it next monday.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Soon enough a schedule slipped into place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On Monday\u2019s they went over societal niceties - Ronnie scowled whenever Vince and Harry called it that, it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018etiquette\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span>, nothing more, nothing less - Greetings, what counted as polite conversation and what fell into dinner talk territory, that kind of thing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Tuesdays and Wednesdays were taken over by heir training, the sort that Harry should have been having since he was eight. The Potters were not as important as the Peverells, but they were still an Ancient and Noble family. Harry needed to be trained in estate management, politics, not to mention his own family history.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Merlin knows why none of this had been mentioned to him beforehand, but he had his money on it being another manipulation via his ex-headmaster. Keeping him ignorant of his place in the world and all that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thursdays spelt what Harry took to calling finishing school. Ronnie was on his back about his posture and the way he sat, hell, she even had an opinion on the way he drank his tea. Vincent liked to laugh at him, but that always led to Ronnie turning her attention onto him - giving Harry a lovely break while she snapped at Vince to \u201csit up straight, for heaven's sake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fridays were his least favorite by far, where they went over everything he needed to know about surviving in the past. Most of which he was planning to disregard, honestly. There were just some things he wouldn\u2019t abide by - but he had to know the rules in order to best break them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie was not best pleased to hear it, though she grudgingly accepted it after hours of arguing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry also joined Vince and Ronnie for a morning run and a workout in the afternoon, since Vincent insisted that they all keep fit. In the evening, Harry, Vince, and Ronnie gathered around the dinner table and talked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry found himself surprised by how enjoyable his dinners were with his new \u2018parents\u2019.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince and Ronnie, had been married for ten years and had been a part of The Organisation - for which there was no other name or explanation - for fifteen and seventeen years respectively. They\u2019d both been born and raised in Dallas, and though they had vaguely heard of the boy-who-lived, neither had particularly kept up with his life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which - in hindsight - was probably why they\u2019d been chosen for this assignment. Neither had any living family excluding each other and they weren\u2019t Harry Potter superfans. The organisation seemed to understand well enough that he\u2019d not respond well to people who treated him like the next coming of Merlin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie and Vince were nothing like that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They actually... parented him. Which was an </span>\n<em>\n<span>experience</span>\n</em>\n<span>, to say the least. He\u2019d never actually had that before, so he was naturally a bit resistant to it, at first. But after one argument too many Vincent had sat them all down to hash out some concrete rules.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That had helped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had very soon gotten comfortable with Ronnie and Vincent. Enough so that he didn\u2019t mind needling them about just what \u2018The Organisation\u2019 was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They never gave him much information, and at this point he was fairly certain they didn\u2019t quite know what was going on either, but he\u2019d managed to suss out enough to know that they\u2019d both been approached straight out of Ilvermorny and neither had been able to resist the high pay or the benefits.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seemed to Harry that The Organisation kept its employees on a need to know basis, they seemed to be assassins of some nature, even though most of their jobs revolved more around saving and maneuvering people rather than killing them. Rarely did they get to interact with other employees. The jobs were often sporadic and required a certain\u2026 moral ambiguity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, again, the pay was extraordinary.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d Harry asked with a dubious look at Ronnie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She said, adding another book to the pile stacked atop his head, \u201cNow, walk back and forth ten times.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry grumbled, but complied. He made three trips before wobbling, and another two before tipping over completely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie smiled nevertheless, \u201cYou\u2019ve improved.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust barely.\u201d He sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cImprovement is improvement, young man.\u201d She helped him gather the fallen books before setting him back up. She met his eyes and held his gaze for a moment, \u201cAgain.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExplain what you\u2019ve learnt about the way magic functions.\u201d Vincent said, closing Harry\u2019s notebook and nodding at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay so there\u2019s Light magic, Grey magic, Dark magic, and Black magic.\u201d Harry started, biting his lip as he tried to recall all he\u2019d learnt in the past few weeks, \u201cLight magic is very cut and dry. If you say the spell right and do the wand movement perfectly, you\u2019ll get results. This is the easiest form of spell casting because the spells absorb the latent energy surrounding us and use it to do what we want it to do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0Vincent nodded, taking a sip of his tea, \u201cAnd examples are?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMost transfiguration spells, like Evanesco.\u201d Harry hesitated, biting his lip, \u201cI\u2019m still confused though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOn what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought light spells don\u2019t rely on intent? But Evanesco is classified as a light spell and is wholly reliant on intent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh,\u201d Vincent hummed, placing his cup back down. \u201cCommon misconception, kiddo. </span>\n<em>\n<span>All</span>\n</em>\n<span> magic requires intent. You want something, you direct your magic, it happens. The difference between light and dark is that dark magic can be </span>\n<em>\n<span>altered</span>\n</em>\n<span> by feeling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s take the knockback jinx. It\u2019s a dark spell, and hence requires both intent </span>\n<em>\n<span>and</span>\n</em>\n<span> feeling. If I </span>\n<em>\n<span>want</span>\n</em>\n<span> to knock you back and I </span>\n<em>\n<span>feel</span>\n</em>\n<span> anger towards you, that would blast you right off your feet - but let\u2019s say I felt fondness towards you in that moment\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would be more like a light shove?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Vincent clapped him on the shoulder, \u201cLight magic is clinical. It does what you tell it to do. But Dark magic doesn\u2019t rely on excess energy, you use the strength </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> have in your own magical core - and your magic is nothing if not a reflection of your inner desires.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright.\u201d Harry nodded, \u201cSo Dark magic is more varied, then? Because each spell\u2019s intensity would differ depending on what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes. And Dark magic is more than just jinxes, hexes, and curses. All rituals and magical ceremonies are either Dark or Grey.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blinked, drawing the connection, \u201cSo </span>\n<em>\n<span>that\u2019s</span>\n</em>\n<span> why magic was getting weaker! All the dark rituals had been banned by the ministry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent hummed sadly, \u201cThe energy left by dark spells would not have been enough to sustain us for another twenty years. The rituals used to - still do, I suppose - feed latent energy into the very earth annually. Voldemort boosted the latent energy\u2026 but it would never have been enough to save us, not for long anyway. And the ministry is already starting to crack down on us here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to stop that?\u201d Harry asked helplessly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent covered Harry\u2019s palm with his own, \u201cYou just gotta get your generation onside. Convince your fellow students that Dark magic ain\u2019t all bad. And hey, don\u2019t sweat - Ronnie and I are doing everything we can to ease your path at the ministry. You\u2019ve got </span>\n<em>\n<span>time</span>\n</em>\n<span>, kid. We know you can do this, The Organisation wouldn\u2019ta sent you back if you didn\u2019t have a good shot at succeeding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince squeezed Harry's hand, and Harry squeezed his back, \u201cThanks vince.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnytime, kid.\u201d He smiled, \u201cNow, Grey magic?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA combination of light and Dark. Requires more conscious thought than the typical light spell but still feeds off the latent energy surrounding us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood. Examples?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Patronus charm, commonly believed to be the ultimate light charm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince snorted, \u201cPeople do tend to get carried away with their symbolism, don\u2019t they? Last one, Harry: Black magic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNecromancy and horcruxes. The kind of magic that takes too much.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStay far away from Black magic.\u201d Vince cautioned, \u201cIt\u2019s like a drug, you become dependent on it even as it drains the life from you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, Vince.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt never hurts to be cautious, kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blinked, absolutely bewildered, as Ronnie and Vince sat calmly at the breakfast table. They were both holding a vial of their blood and Vince was drawing out a small runic circle on a slab of wood.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie rolled her eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little ritual. We don\u2019t even need </span>\n<em>\n<span>your</span>\n</em>\n<span> blood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, \u201cBut why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll our records have us placed in Dallas Texas for the last fifteen years, how the hell do you wanna explain your accent?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry pouted, \u201cI could fake one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie snorted, \u201cGo ahead, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh\u2026 nevermind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Ronnie smiled, \u201cAll you\u2019ve gotta do is drink the potion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cDrink the potion, get a southern accent. Easy as pie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie beamed, \u201cLook at that, Vince! He\u2019s already picking up our expressions.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou're getting more than our accents, Kiddo.\u201d Vince looked up slightly from the circle he was drawing, \u201cYou\u2019ll also get a few of our features.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarry.\u201d Ronnie said after a brief pause, \u201cYou understand what kind of ritual this is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shook his head slowly, \u201cI thought you were just giving me an accent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a blood adoption ritual.\u201d Vince said, \u201cWith a little something extra to allow for the accent to transfer. It won\u2019t change you too much, you\u2019re too grown for that, but you\u2019ll look related to us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rationally speaking, Harry knew that this ritual was more than necessary. While Vincent did sort of look like him, with their similar brown skin and messy hair - Harry didn\u2019t really share any facial features with Ronnie or him. Plus, having a British accent would give the game away to any suspicious parties right off the bat - which would be bad, to say the least.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he couldn\u2019t force himself to say anything else, even as Ronnie and Vince looked at him with concern.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Ronnie said softly, \u201cYou know we do care about you. Vince and I, we\u2019ve never had kids, but over these past few months\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ve started to think of you as our own, Harry.\u201d Vincent finished for her, \u201cAnd we\u2019re not leaving you. It\u2019s kind of our job.\u201d He added a wink to the last bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed a little in spite of himself and Ronnie reached forwards to grasp his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDear,\u201d She said, \u201cYou know we love you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He couldn\u2019t help the slight rasp in his voice, \u201cYou do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow could we not?\u201d Vince smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re a great kid, and you\u2019re going to do great things.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sniffled, \u201cNo - no one\u2019s ever said that to me before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh honey.\u201d Ronnie gathered him in a hug, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this if you\u2019re not ready. We can -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry said, \u201cI\u2019m ready. I want to do this. I - I love you guys too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With that Ronnie pulled him into another tight hug before pulling back and holding his cheeks in the palms of her hand. \u201cMy sweet boy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent reached over to grip his shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s do this then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince finished the last rune before placing a bronze goblet in the centre of the circle and pouring both vails of their blood into it. The runes lit up, from the base of the goblet to the outer ring of the circle, the air surrounding the circle seemed to almost sizzle with heat. Then the glowing stopped and Vince grabbed the goblet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry raised an eyebrow, \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone always thinks Dark magic is complicated,\u201d Vince said with an eye roll, \u201cThe hardest bit was not smudging the bloody runes. Now, drink up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry took the goblet, looked at it for a moment, and downed it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He grimaced when the coppery tang hit his tongue. For some reason, he hadn\u2019t quite expected it to taste like blood, but it was highly similar to what he imagined melted blood pops would taste like, just more\u2026 intense.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBleh.\u201d He said, smacking his lips. \u201cIs something supposed to happen?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince snorted. \u201cGive it a second.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlrigh-\u201d Harry stopped short when his skin literally </span>\n<em>\n<span>rippled</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hadn\u2019t sat down before taking the potion, which was very clearly a mistake, seeing as the pain spiking behind his eyes made him pitch forwards. The table and Ronnie's quick reaction were the only things stopping him from tumbling onto the floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The potion made his mouth feel like it did when he\u2019d just woken up and his scalp itched, even his fingers and toes tingled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It passed slowly in a series of waves. The first was the most intense, almost knocking him straight off his feet, followed by three more waves of pain, each a little less painful, until he was left breathing heavily panting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay there?\u201d Vince had stood up, helping to support his weight by throwing his arm under Harry's shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll good.\u201d Harry wheezed, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d He almost jumped in surprise at the sound of his own voice, which now had a distinct southern twang.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie laughed slightly at the face he made, checked to make sure he was securely held by Vince before letting him go and summoning the nearest mirror, \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry straightened his glasses and gaped at his reflection.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Huh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He still looked very much like himself - anybody from the future would have probably mistaken him for his own brother. His green eyes were still present, but they looked more similar to Ronnie\u2019s turquoise than the striking emerald it had once been. His hair was as messy as ever but the colour had lightened slightly. Both his jawline and his cheekbones had sharpened to match Vincents, while his nose and lips had remained the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aside from that, nothing much had changed besides perhaps two inches added to his height.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI look\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike our son.\u201d Ronnie said softly. Staring at his reflection just as intently as he was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSounds like it too.\u201d Vince couldn\u2019t seem to stop beaming.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry touched his jaw, feeling a smile stretch across his new face. He threw his arms around them both and whispered into Ronnie\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDoes this mean I can say \u2018y'all\u2019 now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood luck, kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent was holding onto both of his shoulders, smiling broadly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie handed him his shrunk down trunk, ruffling his hair, \u201cDon\u2019t get in too much trouble\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you that.\u201d Harry grinned even when Ronnie glared.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh go on then\u201d Vince let his shoulders go, giving him a small shove, \u201cwe don\u2019t want you to miss your train.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed, stepping away, \u201cLove you guys.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLove you too, kid!\u201d Vince shouted after him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to write!\u201d Ronnie added.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI won\u2019t\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And with that Harry stepped onto the Hogwarts express.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It looked exactly like it did fifty years from now, but the people were almost alien. Sure, he\u2019d been out and about during the summer - Ronnie insisted on it so that he could stop gaping at the fashion. But still. People were just </span>\n<em>\n<span>different</span>\n</em>\n<span> - it was almost scary how much could change in five decades - they were more contained, almost, or wild and crazy in different ways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He meandered the train carriages, looking for an empty compartment. Heads turned every now and then, mostly from kids his age who found they couldn\u2019t recognise him, but nobody approached him. Eventually he found a compartment, slipping inside and wandlessly enlarging his trunk before shoving it in the holder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two months ago, he\u2019d barely been able to drag his trunk onto the train, let alone lifting it to put it away. He was suddenly very thankful for the strict workout routine that Vince had insisted upon. He\u2019d gone from a scrawny wisp of a boy to a well defined, just about average height, young man - and it only took three separate potion regimes and one extremely well paid physiotherapist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The wandless magic was something Ronnie taught him. She was ahead of him in leaps and bounds, but she\u2019d managed to teach him enough to summon and banish, shrink and enlarge - he\u2019d gain more mastery over it in time, but for now that was his entire wandless arsenal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With that aforementioned skill he summoned a runic book from his bag with a flick of his wrist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d discovered a shocking love for runes during the summer. Vince, who was something of a rune master himself, had told him he was very advanced for only having two months of practice - with a lot of extra studying, he\u2019d probably score well on his O.W.L\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had elected to drop divination, taking up Runes instead, but other than that his schedule would be much the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The book, one that wouldn\u2019t be published for another seventeen years, was interesting. It was chock full of information about layering runes, switching between informative instructions and amusing anecdotes of the consequences of layered runes gone wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t even notice how much time had passed until the train started to slow down. With a quiet yelp he hurried to swap out the high waisted dress pants and striped shirt for his plain hogwarts robes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody stared at his robes, which was as blank as all the other first years, but that was only because he was quite possibly the last person all but sprinting off the train.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first years, thankfully, were still gathered around a man - he was tall, not quite Hagrid\u2019s height, and wearing a thick black coat - who lit up when he saw Harry\u2019s confused expression.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOi!\u201d he called, \u201cyou Peverell?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry snapped his head towards the man, smiling broadly in relief and walking briskly to join the crowd of eleven year olds. People were looking now. Harry studiously ignored the whispers easily - he had </span>\n<em>\n<span>way</span>\n</em>\n<span> too much practice at doing just that - and briefly nodded to what must have been the gameskeeper.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The lack of Hagrid sent a pang of sadness through Harry. He shoved the feeling down, just as he\u2019d done when he realised that neither Ron nor Hermione would be joining him in his compartment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d have his inevitable breakdown later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Preferably in the comfort of his own bed, behind at least seven different privacy charms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight!\u201d The gameskeeper said, \u201cFollow me, firsties.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first years gawked at him, all of them clearly confused as to what he was doing going with them, and Harry did his best to smile politely at all of them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he got in a boat, only two others joined him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A boy with inky black hair and grey eyes turned slightly to face Harry. \u201cMy name is Cygnus Black, scion of the Most ancient and Most noble house of Black, merry meet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet, Black.\u201d Harry replied, consciously stymying the urge to offer his hand, \u201cI am Hadrien Peverell, Heir to the Most ancient and Most noble house of Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry watched, mildly amused, as the other boy\u2019s eyes widened for a fraction of a second before he dipped into a slightly awkward bow, seeing as how they were sat on a boat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other boy on the boat turned as well, introducing himself as, \u201cFloxel Lestrange, Scion of the ancient and noble house of Lestrange, Merry meet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He offered his hand and Harry shook it firmly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet,\u201d he echoed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Conversation paused briefly as they caught their first glimpse of the castle. Hogwarts sat proudly against the sky, looking just as beautiful as she did in fifty years. Harry\u2019s heart stuttered in his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody said a word until the gameskeeper left them in the hands of Dumbledore, who was now the transfiguration professor. Harry had almost tripped right then and there at the sight of his old - now young - headmaster, doubly so when those blue eyes met his.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr Peverell,\u201d He said, \u201cA word.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry quickly made his way over to Dumbledore, \u201cMerry meet, professor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry did not offer his arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIndeed, Mr Peverell.\u201d Dumbledore said softly, \u201cI want to be the first to welcome you to Hogwarts, you\u2019ve made a good decision to transfer in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe first years will be sorted before you, so do not be concerned if we do not call your name.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded, \u201cI understand, professor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then,\u201d he nodded back, then louder, he said to the rest of the students, \u201cI'll be back soon. Do try to behave yourselves until then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a swish of his brightly coloured robes, the professor was off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus Black had made his way closer to Harry sometime during Dumbledore\u2019s little chat because as soon as Harry turned, the boy was standing right infront of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeverell,\u201d He said, \u201cAre you transferring from another wizarding school?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been homeschooled most of my life.\u201d Harry answered, gesturing slightly with his hands, \u201cMy Ma thought it would be better to do my O.W.Ls in a proper school.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry no longer winced at using the southern slang, as he\u2019d done the first few days after the ritual. It was almost natural, now, though he was still working on the expressions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh,\u201d The younger boy paused, hesitating before asking, \u201cAnd you\u2019re from the colonies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed lightly at the boys barely concealed frown, \u201cI was raised there. We only came back home about a year ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus opened his mouth to ask more when the doors opened, revealing Professor Dumbledore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome along, children.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They followed along, Harry lagging behind with Cygnus sticking close by. The boy looked a little lost and a lot terrified, and when they reached the great hall, he angled his body slightly towards Harry. If Harry didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d think he\u2019d just accidentally adopted a first year puppy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>People were staring at him. He kept his back straight and his shoulders loose, allowing his eyes to scan the tables, not once settling on any one person - even when his eyes met a familiar dark brown stare, he\u2019d forced him to keep going. He presented a calm, slightly bored demeanor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie would be proud.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dumbledore unfurled the list after the sorting hat finished its song - something or another about the light at the end of the tunnel and having bravery in the face of adversity - and began calling up names.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He paid just enough attention to note when Cygnus was sorted into Slytherin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He clapped for the kid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he knew it Dumbledore had gone through the entire scroll.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll right then, Students.\u201d He said, \u201cPlease welcome our newest transfer student, Hadrian Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry walked up to the stool, which looked almost comically small when he sat down on it, and sighed as the hat was placed on his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Welcome back Mr Potter,</span>\n</em>\n<span> the hat said in his head. </span>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s so rare I get a time traveller.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s Peverell now</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Harry thought back to it. </span>\n<em>\n<span>And you\u2019ve seen other time travellers?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Of course, that organisation has sent maybe\u2026 three others over the centuries</span>\n</em>\n<span> the hat hummed,</span>\n<em>\n<span> Now, let\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. You\u2019re just as brave as you were - or, should i say will be? - but I fear the lion\u2019s would not be able to survive the new you.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shrugged, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I figured.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Your Loyalty is a strong trait, but it must be earned. The badgers prefer to give it easily. Ravenclaw or Slytherin, hmm, either would serve you well. But you already know where you must go, don\u2019t you?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sighed. He did, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I do.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Then</span>\n</em>\n<span>, said the hat, </span>\n<em>\n<span>better be</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2026 \u201cSlytherin!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The hall broke into polite applause. Harry stood, placing the hat back on the stool and smiling slightly at Dumbledore before making his way to the Slytherin table. Cygnus, sitting near people who must have been his cousins, motioned Harry over.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet, Peverell.\u201d One of the boys offered his arm after he\u2019d taken his seat beside Cygnus \u201cI am Orion Black, Heir to the Most ancient and Most noble house of Black.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry gripped his wrist, \u201cMerry meet.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMay I introduce my sister, Lucretia Black and my cousin, Walburga Black.\u201d Both girls dipped their heads, the approximation of a seated curtsy. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget Cousin Alphard. I believe you already know Cygnus?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded, laughing lightly at the pained expression on Orion\u2019s face when he mentioned Alphard, \u201cMerry meet, everyone.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, Peverell.\u201d Lucretia smiled across the table, \u201cCall us by our given names, it\u2019s far too confusing otherwise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled at her, allowing a relieved chuckle to escape, \u201cThank you, I was wondering how longer I could get away without having to specify between you all. You all may call me Hadrian, aswell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Walburga and Lucretia laughed, even Orion cracked a smile at Harry\u2019s wiry expression.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, Hadrian.\u201d Orion said, \u201cCygnus told me you were raised in the colonies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry raised an eyebrow at Cygnus, who blushed. \u201cNews travels fast around here. But yes, my pops got a job in Dallas when I was a kid. We only moved back home a year ago, and ma decided that tutors weren\u2019t good enough for my O.W.L year, so here I am.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re in fifth year?\u201d Orion asked, smiling when Harry nodded, \u201cSame as me, then. Lucretia and Walburga are both sixth years. Alphard\u2019s in his seventh year.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat subjects are you all taking?\u201d Harry asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Soon enough the entire group was exchanging subjects, Harry even got to regale the Black family with a watered down story of that time he\u2019d ridden a thestral. Over the course of the meal Harry was introduced to Rudolph Lestrange, Abraxas Malfoy, and Herbert Avery - all boys in his year group.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>None of them were anything like their future selves. Harry had never even </span>\n<em>\n<span>heard</span>\n</em>\n<span> of Lucretia Black before. He looked for a trace of madness, an inkling of the monsters they, and their future children, would become - and he found nothing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He supposed that fifty years changed a lot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thankfully, he\u2019d been seated far enough down the table that he\u2019d not yet interacted with one Tom Marvolo Riddle. Though he knew they\u2019d be sharing a room later, the delayed introduction was much appreciated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dinner came to a close, after Harry had finished off a healthy serving of treacle tart, and Harry followed the Blacks down to the Slytherin common room, making sure to stay a step behind them the whole time - so as to not give away that he knew where they were going.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lucretia said the password, \u201cViper\u201d, and Harry committed it to memory.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFollow me, Hadrian,\u201d Orion motioned at him, \u201cI\u2019ll show you to our dorm room.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled gratefully at him, and followed Orion until he swung open a heavy wooden door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Slytherin rooms were bigger than Gryffindor rooms, significantly so. It was a large rectangular room, rather than the circular structure up in the towers, each canopy bed was accompanied by a desk and a wardrobe, as well as a bedside table.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Back in Gryffindor they\u2019d had to keep all their clothes in their trunks, and studying had to be done in the common room or the library. Harry found himself grateful for the change.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lestrange, Malfoy, and Avery had all beat Orion and him to the room, likely because the Black brood had taken to pointing out routes and significant places to Harry on the way down from the great hall.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled at them. And that\u2019s when he noticed Riddle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other boy had been sitting on his bed - right next to the one with Harry\u2019s trunk sitting in front of it, lovely - but he\u2019d stood up when they entered the room.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle walked forwards, stopping in front of them. \u201cMerry meet, Orion.\u201d He turned to Harry, \u201cMerry meet, Peverell. I am Tom Riddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet, Riddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle offered his arm. Harry shook his hand, expertly hiding how pleased it made him when the action sparked a flare of anger in Riddle's eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a moment, neither of them let go.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Harry blinked, and the moment passed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom went back to his bed and Orion smiled at Harry before moving towards his own.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry mentally shook off the weirdness of that whole interaction, took a deep breath, and set off towards his corner of the room, which was right beside a large window that had a beautiful view of the lake - it was also beside Riddle\u2019s, which he was trying not to think about.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Harry unpacked his clothes into the wardrobe, he listened to the other boy's conversation. They mostly chatted about what they\u2019d gotten up to over the summer, homework and annoying little siblings, trivial things. Abraxas even gushed about his betrothed, Medusa - who it seemed he was very much taken by.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was nothing like what he\u2019d expected of the future Dark Lord and his most trusted cronies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They even included Harry in the conversation, asking him about his childhood and homelife. Rudolph mentioned quidditch, which automatically caused Tom to roll his eyes so hard Harry thought they\u2019d fall out, and Harry grinned. The two enthusiastically departed techniques for the better part of half an hour, until Tom loudly declared that he\u2019d murder them both if they said one more word on the topic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rudolph and Harry both laughed - Harry, mostly, laughed because the statement had been said as a joke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Imagine that, a dark lord, </span>\n<em>\n<span>joking</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One by one the boys went to bed, mumbling their goodnights before shutting their curtains, until it was just Tom and Harry left awake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWelcome to Slytherin, Peverell.\u201d Tom said suddenly, Harry eyed him wearily, \u201cI doubt you stuck around for the first year speech, so I\u2019ll inform you now. We are not trusted or liked, professors will be biased against us, and we protect our own.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI see.\u201d Harry said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere is a certain hierarchy around here, Peverell.\u201d Harry met those blazing eyes again, \u201cDo not attempt to rise above your station, not so soon anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry\u2019s eyes narrowed. Anger coiled deep in his belly and he was well aware that his eyes were probably doing that thing that </span>\n<em>\n<span>made</span>\n</em>\n<span> people listen to him. He was meant to befriend Tom Riddle. He was meant to save him from himself - the prat didn\u2019t have to make it so damn difficult, though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A mantra of: </span>\n<em>\n<span>save him, save him, save him </span>\n</em>\n<span>ran through his skull.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that so, Riddle?\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>dammit</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happens if I decide to mess with your little hierarchy system?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle took a step closer. Harry, still sitting crossed leg on his bed, stared up at him with an unimpressed frown.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Peverell. Nobody\u2019s ever been foolish enough to find out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell then,\u201d Harry said, his cold tone sounded even more menacing with the accent, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll both be learning something new.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shut the curtain, spelling it so that nobody would be able to hear him or open it during the night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The </span>\n<em>\n<span>nerve</span>\n</em>\n<span> of that boy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Gods above, Harry had never dealt with someone who could rile him up in so few words - except well, maybe Snape. The spells on his curtains were one way, so he could hear Tom out there huffing to himself as he too climbed into bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With the darkness surrounding him, the anger drained and all the bittersweet sorrow of the day rushed in to take its place. A sob wracked it\u2019s way through his throat and he drew his knees up to his chest in order to hide his face in his legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d done this more than a few times back at Peverell manor, when the guilt and sorrow were just too much. Sometimes he\u2019d see a book that Hermione would love, or hear a joke that would have sent Ron into a fit of laughter, and it would take all his strength not to fall apart.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was always worse when he\u2019d had a nightmare beforehand. He\u2019d see his parents, or Cedric, or Sirius die - or he\u2019d relieve the crutios or his possession - and wake up in a cold sweat, screaming himself hoarse.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie and Vince had developed a schedule of checking up on him by the second week at the manor, he\u2019d lost count of the amount of times he\u2019d cried himself to sleep in one of their arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They weren\u2019t sleeping down the hall anymore. Harry was alone again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hugged his knees even tighter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Being in Hogwarts was like a balm to his wounded soul, but it was also a stark reminder of all the things he\u2019d given up - his friends, his house, his </span>\n<em>\n<span>name</span>\n</em>\n<span>, all of it. It </span>\n<em>\n<span>broke</span>\n</em>\n<span> something in him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry couldn\u2019t recall falling asleep that night, but when he woke up his face was still sticky.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had never been able to sleep in later than six a.m - a consequence of being woken up by Petunia for the first eleven years of his life. It was just ingrained in his body, something that would likely never change.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, on his first day of Hogwarts in the forties, Harry slid his curtain open at five fifty three in the morning. Toeing his way to his wardrobe, he pulled out a pair of workout shorts, a simple t-shirt, and his running shoes before making his way to the fifth year bathroom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He quickly brushed his teeth and splashed his face with water, slipping into his workout clothes and leaving his pyjamas in one of the lockers near the showers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody, not even the portraits were up, so Harry didn\u2019t have to pretend to be lost. He quickly made his way out to the great lake.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After stretching thoroughly, he set off at a strong pace following the curve of the lake. Vince would be proud to know that he\u2019d be keeping up with his exercise, but it was mostly because the strenuous work was a great way to work off his stress and tension.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He did five laps around the lake and he was red and sweaty by the end of it. A quick tempus showed it was only six thirty, meaning his roommates would probably be up soon.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t hurry on his way down to the common room, giving himself a chance to catch his breath and maybe reduce the redness in his cheeks before seeing anyone. Unfortunately, the universe was not so kind, and he ran into three gryffindor boys before he even got off the ground floor of the castle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOi! Ain\u2019t you that transfer student.\u201d One of them said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet,\u201d Harry said slightly breathlessly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a </span>\n<em>\n<span>posh</span>\n</em>\n<span> one.\u201d Another boy commented.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled at them, \u201cNot if I don\u2019t have to be, but I\u2019d rather not accidentally mortally offend anyone. My ma would have my head.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know exactly what you mean, mate.\u201d the third boy said, \u201cI\u2019m Fleamont Potter. This is Timothy Prewett and Arnold Davidson.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All three of them tensed slightly when Fleamont said Arnold\u2019s last name, watching him closely for any adverse reaction. Harry just nodded with a smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNice to meet ya\u2019ll.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow,\u201d Davidson said, \u201cYou\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>southern</span>\n</em>\n<span> southern.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed, he did love using that term, \u201csuppose so. Say, what are ya\u2019ll doing up so early?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were just heading to the kitchens,\u201d Fleamont said, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get a cup of coffee as a student. You were running?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I used to do it every day back home, don't think my old man would be too pleased if I fell off the wagon at boarding school.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes, and the three boys laughed, \u201cWould you mind showing me to the kitchen sometime, I\u2019ve got to go shower now, but I </span>\n<em>\n<span>need</span>\n</em>\n<span> some coffee if I\u2019m going to survive out here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure.\u201d Fleamont agreed easily, \u201cAfter class today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019d be great, thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot a problem. See you later, Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry echoed the sentiment and turned back towards the dungeons, thankfully not running into any other students beside a ravenclaw girl - who squeeked, blushed, and all but sprinted away when she spotted </span>\n<span>him. He made it back to the dorm room just in time to watch Orion douse Abraxas in water via an </span>\n<span>Aguamenti charm</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry burst into laughter at the spluttering Malfoy heir. Startling both boys, as well as the half asleep Rudolph and Herbert.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadiran!\u201d Orion said, \u201cI checked to wake you up and\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled mischievously, \u201cI assume I would have received similar treatment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Orion shrugged sheepishly and Harry snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI went for a run.\u201d He said, grabbing a fresh set of robes before making his way to the showers, with Rudolph close behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once inside the shower room, Harry pulled his shirt over his head, using it to wipe some of the sweat off his face before tossing it in the hamper. Rudolph pretended not to notice as he quietly fist pumped as the shirt landed inside the hamper.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This moment, precisely, is the moment Tom-fucking-riddle decided to walk out of the shower, clad in nothing but a low riding towel with his wet hair and pale skin on full display.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t gape. He didn\u2019t do more than blink once, twice, before smiling slightly at Tom - who\u2019s eyes were caught at his midriff and distinctly </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood </span>\n<em>\n<span>Morning</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Riddle.\u201d Harry smirked as Tom\u2019s eyes snapped up to his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d He cleared his throat, \u201cGood morning, Peverell, Rudolph.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry swung his towel over his shoulder, whistling a tune he knew would tick Tom off as he toed out of his shoes and socks. He stepped behind the curtain of one shower cubicle, hung his shorts over the rail and rinsed off the sweat and dirt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time he finished, Tom was gone and Rudolph was putting on his shoes. Abraxas, Orion, and Herbert were still in the showers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry made quick work of putting his uniform on, using the mirror to straighten his tie and towel his hair dry. About halfway through this, Orion exited the shower. Harry waved to him as he left the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After making a quick stop by the dorms to grab his bag, Harry hurried to the common room and managed to catch Lucretia and Walburga on their way out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLucretia, Walburga!\u201d He called, holding out his arms like Ronnie had taught him, \u201cWould you mind showing me the way to the great hall?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Both girls took an arm each, Walburga smiled, \u201cOff course, Hadrian.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girls were happy to involve him in their conversation - a heated debate on the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of using charmed equipment in potion making - and it seemed no time at all before they were seated at the Slytherin table and serving themselves breakfast.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unlike the feast, Harry was sat directly across from Riddle, one of the other only people to be awake so early.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, Peverell.\u201d Riddle started, \u201cWhere were you this morning?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry swallowed the bite of egg he\u2019d just taken, \u201cI\u2019m an early riser, decided I might as well make use of the grounds and do a bit of running.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe lake is just beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lucretia sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded in agreement, \u201cEven more so from below.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Riddle said, \u201cThe windows are my favourite part of our dorms.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry hummed in agreement and conversation faded out as they all ate in comfortable silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hogwarts in the forties was equally challenging and a breeze.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry, thanks to some rigorous training by Vince and Ronnie, was well ahead of most of his classmates in terms of theory, he was on par, if slightly behind, Riddle in that department. But what he lacked in theoretical knowledge he made up for in sheer power.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vince said it was because he\u2019d been forced to stretch and use far more of his magic than anyone his age should have. As such, his magic had grown like a muscle, equal in strength to what a fully grown auror\u2019s would look like - and it would only grow until he reached his majority.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The one subject he struggled in was runes - mostly because he only had about two months of study to back it up while everyone else had two years - but it was also the class he enjoyed the most, so he hardly minded having to stay back and study it in the library.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the first few weeks of school, it became abruptly clear to everyone in Hogwarts that Tom Riddle finally had a rival.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It all started on the first Defence lesson of the term.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Professor Merrythought, who\u2019d been at Hogwarts for the past ten years, was already sat at her desk when Harry walked in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d She\u2019d said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He\u2019d offered her a toothy grin, \u201cJust transferred.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTexas?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded, \u201cDallas.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had hurried to take his seat, seeing as how they\u2019d filled up while he was chatting with the professor. Eventually he settled for one in the second row and to the left. Riddle was up front and centre - pretentious prick.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone had settled, the professor clapped her hands together and stood up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright class, welcome back. I trust you\u2019ve had a nice break.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for them to give more than a general sound of agreement before plowing ahead, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to cover before you sit for your O.W.Ls, you\u2019ll be able to pick up a full copy of the syllabus from my desk at the end of the class, but can anyone tell me why, exactly, this class is so important.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle raised his hand, \u201cWe live in a dangerous world, we must be able to protect ourselves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery close, Mr Riddle. But I\u2019m looking for something a little bit more specific\u2026 yes, Mr Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEvery witch and Wizard carries around a wand.\u201d Harry said slowly, when the professor nodded, he continued more confidently, \u201cSo each of us has the ability to cause a ridiculous amount of damage. Aurors can\u2019t always get to the scene in time, so it\u2019s up to all of us to help keep each other in check.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent, Mr Peverell. Five points for Slytherin.\u201d She turned to the rest of the class, \u201cNow, I can have you memorise and practice these spells to your heart's content. But what use is that if you can\u2019t use them in a dueling situation. Up you get.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a flick of her wand, Merrythought sent their tables flying neatly to the sides of the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, everyone pair up with someone from the opposite house - and make it quick or I\u2019ll do the pairings myself. We\u2019re doing shielding charms today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone hurried to grab a partner. Harry was guessing their professor had a history of pairing rivals together. He blew a sigh of relief when a blushing ravenclaw girl made her way over and asked if he\u2019d partner with her. He ignored the way most of his housemates scowled, must be a muggleborn then.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once all students had settled in their pairs, Merrythought leaned back against her desk and asked, \u201cAlright, who knows the most common shield charm? Mr Riddle?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Protego charm, Professor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCorrect, take five points.\u201d Professor Merrythought pushed off her desk and began pacing slowly, \u201cThe protego charm is one of the most useful spells you\u2019ll ever learn. There are five variations of it, which are\u2026?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His ravenclaw partener stuck her hand in the air, \u201cUm, Protego duo, which protects you from both physical and magical attacks. Protego Horribilis, which uh, it\u2019s the most powerful variation and protects against anything except the killing curse. Protego maxima, that one shields an area, It\u2019s what\u2019s around Hogwarts, I think. And Protego totalum protects an area from magic for an extended period of time. I\u2019m - uh - not so sure about the last variation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery good Miss Andrews, Ten points to ravenclaw. Mr Peverell can you help your partner with the last variation?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded, \u201cProtego Diabolica, Professor. It creates a ring of black fire around an area, which allows your allies to pass through while burning your enemies to ash. Nasty bit of dark magic, that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Professor nodded, \u201cFive points. Now, if you ever encounter a Protego Diabolica, you\u2019d best hope you count as an ally to the caster - we will </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> be teaching this variation at school, but i find it best to make sure you\u2019re all informed. We\u2019ll work on a basic Protego first. Slytherins, you\u2019re up first. Ravenclaws, cast </span>\n<em>\n<span>only</span>\n</em>\n<span> an expelliarmus at your partners.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The ravenclaw smiled at him, \u201cI\u2019m Mandy, by the way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t bother with the political speech, instead offering her a grin in return, \u201cLovely to meet you, Mandy. I\u2019m Hadrian. Let\u2019s get started shall we?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mandy responded with a bolt of red light. Harry laughed, flicking his wand, and her spell spread out into a faint red splotch before fizzling into nothing when it made contact with his shield.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery good Mr Peverell, Mr Riddle. Take ten points each for being the first to successfully cast the spell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry looked around, noticing that every other Slytherin besides him and Tom had been relieved of their wands. Mandy was beaming at him, but Tom\u2019s partner looked incredibly frustrated. Harry winked at Tom, who somehow managed to look even more annoyed than his partner - poor boy mustn't be used to competition.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFive more minutes,\u201d The professor warned, \u201cThen we\u2019re swapping roles.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mandy attempted to disarm him seven more times, each was easily blocked. By the fifth try Harry was attempting to push the magic straight out of his core, rather than funneling it through his wand.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was highly draining, and it showed in the way Mandy\u2019s spells seemed to push his shield closer to his body instead of just dying on contact.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time it was their turn to switch Harry was panting and sweating. Mandy eyed him critically.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat were you trying to do?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing.\u201d Harry said slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Mandy deadpanned, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you randomly started sweating after the sixth round.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry scowled at her, she was perceptive, he\u2019ll give her that, \u201cAlright fine. I was trying to do it wandlessly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh for pete\u2019s sake.\u201d She rolled her eyes, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be so worn out you won\u2019t be able to disarm me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry tilted his head, \u201cUnlikely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou wanna bet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shot a silent Expelliarmus at her, plucking her wand out of the air with ease, \u201cNo. It\u2019d be hopelessly unfair to take your money so easily.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mandy laughed, \u201cYou didn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>warn</span>\n</em>\n<span> me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be warned in an actual duel,\u201d Harry winked, \u201cConsider this practice. Now put your wand up and cast the shield.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes sir.\u201d Mandy lifted her wand, \u201cProtego!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry\u2019s Expelliarmus shattered her shield on impact.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d Mandy frowned, \u201cAnd how\u2019d you get yours to absorb mine, aren\u2019t they supposed to ricochet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you can modify the protego to take in the external spell to feed itself.\u201d Harry explained stepping forward so he could raise her wand arm gently, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is aim higher, so the flick has a slight downward stroke. The tough part is the timing, because you\u2019ve technically got to cast the spell twice. You\u2019ll actually be creating a double layer of shields, with the first one allowing spells in but not out, and the second being impermeable.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo it trapped my expelliarmus in the middle?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly,\u201d Harry nodded, \u201cIt contained it long enough for your control over the magic to dissipate, at which point my shields could absorb the pure energy. It\u2019s far more effective than the other version, since it allows you to stop placing your own magic into the shields and doesn\u2019t cause the spell to fly around and hit bystanders.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A hand clapped on his shoulder and Harry jumped in surprise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn all that, Mr Peverell?\u201d Merrythought asked with one eyebrow raised, \u201cYou\u2019re correct, of course - but only aurors learn the absorption technique.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shrugged, noticing that every eye in the room was pointed at him. Riddle\u2019s gaze almost burned and his jaw was clenched in a way that looked painful. He didn\u2019t look away when Harry met his stare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy pops taught me, he worked for the ministry back in America.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm.\u201d She said, \u201cTwenty points to Slytherin. Everyone else, back to work. And </span>\n<em>\n<span>please</span>\n</em>\n<span>, do not attempt the absorption method unless you have the first way down to pat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mandy lifted her wand, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind doing some tutoring, would you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, a few pairs down Tom Riddle's brows furrowed in annoyance, \u201cI suppose I\u2019m going to be hounded after today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She grinned toothily in response, \u201cYou bet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry was just as charming as Riddle was, if not more. This was a fact that most of the Hogwarts population could attest to but, while Tom still pulled ahead of Harry on the academic scale, it was no question who was more well liked by the general student populace.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In less than a month he\u2019d managed to strike up a close friendship with Fleamont Potter - who he refused to think of as his own grandfather for fear of giving himself a headache - thus giving him an in with the lions. The other gryffindors were weary at first, the famed rivalry rearing its ugly head, but with three of their own on his side and Harry\u2019s generally cheerful demeanor, it wasn\u2019t long before the rest of the house accepted him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This had, obviously, caused </span>\n<em>\n<span>waves</span>\n</em>\n<span> with the Slytherins. Tom had made good on his word of giving Harry hell for messing with the status quo and he got to see first hand just how much control the future dark lord already had over Slytherin house.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a full week Harry couldn\u2019t go an hour without having to face off against his fellow snakes. The Blacks, as well as his roommates, refrained - but everyone else thought him fair game for his \u2018betrayal\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom, the bastard, looked all too smug about this. Thinking he\u2019d finally cowed Harry into submission.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Harry had watched Tom, at first. He\u2019d seen how people almost gravitated towards him, how he presented a polite, helpful but ultimately aloof persona. Nobody could call Tom rude, in fact most thought of him rather fondly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Harry could do better than that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite only being in Hogwarts (as far as they knew, anyway) for a month, Harry made sure to engage as many people as possible in conversation. He didn\u2019t discriminate between houses or blood status - after all, you trap more flies with honey and all that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry, using his new occlumency skills, stored information about people meticulously in his head. Making sure to ask after a younger sibling or an ailing parent every now and then - it was a sure fire way to build bonds.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The hufflepuffs, especially, adored him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry had made an arrangement to tutor some of the first years after one boy had seen him messing around with his patronus and begged him for help. Things had just spiraled from there and now Thursday evenings had become \u2018designated puff time\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Slytherins Isolation and attack tactic was, hence, highly ineffective. Seeing as he had two whole houses full of friendly faces, not to mention the Blacks - who\u2019d surprisingly stuck by him and refused to bow to the rest of the houses wishes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Orion always rolled his eyes in exasperation when Pomana - his future herbology professor, who was now his herbology study buddy - came to drag him from the Slytherin table to the Hufflepuffs. He\u2019d almost had a heart attack the first time Cygnus had followed Harry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As it turned out, Harry had been right in his initial assessment of the situation. It seemed Cygnus had imprinted on Harry like a duckling. Not that Harry minded, the kid was a little spitfire and actually presented a lot of intelligent conversation for an eleven year old.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d won over the majority of the upper year Slytherin girls by, firstly, treating them like actual people. Harry was well aware that Hermione would find some way to travel back and hex his bits off if he even tried following the more sexist norms of the forties, and even more than that he just </span>\n<em>\n<span>couldn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> treat them the way most of his roommates did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry chatted and laughed with them, asked after their opinions on things, sometimes he\u2019d even sit and embroider with them. He\u2019d learned how when he was seven, when Petunia had started dumping Vernons ripped pants in his lap and told him to fix it. The girls seemed largely delighted to have a boy taking such an active interest in one of their hobbies, and didn\u2019t mind going slightly more slowly and teaching him more complicated stitches.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What few witches remained apprehensive off him, he\u2019d swayed them with his treatment of Cygnus. Most wizards his age would have been annoyed and short with a little firstie being constantly underfoot, but Harry had taken the boy under his wing like a little brother.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Orion had thanked him for it, once. They\u2019d been studying at the library with the rest of their roommates when Orion had knocked their shoulders together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey.\u201d Orion had said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry looked at him in inquiry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks for looking out for Cyg.\u201d He chewed slightly on his inner cheek, \u201cHe was very nervous for Hogwarts.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course.\u201d Harry smiled, \u201cI enjoy having him around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe adores you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019d kill you for telling me that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Abraxas coughed, \u201cIf you ladies are done having your little heart-to-heart, can someone help me with this calming draught worksheet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Orion had blushed and Harry sighed before pulling Abraxas\u2019s homework closer to him and checking through it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ravenclaw, surprisingly, remained the house he was yet to befriend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The claws were rather closed off in their ranks, it was almost like an entire house of Tom Riddles - aloof little geniuses who didn\u2019t take kindly to outsiders. Harry remained a fond acquaintance to the majority of the house despite several endeavours to offer friendship.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After two months of trying Harry chalked it up for a loss. He supposed he\u2019d have to settle for three quarters of the houses, the only consolation was that Riddle had little to no support with the Ravenclaws either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Slytherin boys, after a month of continuously antagonising Harry, found out exactly why that was a terrible idea. He\u2019d, admittedly, lost his cool. It was just one jinx too many, one comment that went too far.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His friendly smile had slipped off his face and he\u2019d hexed them - nine seventh year boys, to be precise - six ways to sunday. None of them were able to leave the hospital wing for a week, and after their release, they didn\u2019t even dare look Harry in the eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Since then, the snakes felt content that Harry had </span>\n<em>\n<span>earned</span>\n</em>\n<span> his place. He\u2019d passed some unspoken test that ensured he could do as he pleased with the support of his house. Harry didn\u2019t question it, these vipers were weird.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lately, Tom had been finding any excuse to sit near Harry. Snagging the seat next to him in the great hall or the library, asking him to be his partner before anyone else could even open their mouths. It was getting to the point where even the most obtuse Gryffindor was starting to notice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry endured it with an exasperated air.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the original timeline, this would have been the year Tom Riddle opened the chamber of secrets and killed Myrtle Warren. It would have been the beginning of the end, the moment Tom killed Myrtle he would have stepped over a line, using her accidental death to split his soul.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Keeping the boy occupied with his newest \u2018obsession\u2019 was certainly one way to prevent that series of events.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Dear Hadrian,</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>How is the castle, dear? The Manor is awfully lonely without you. Vincent is sitting beside me, reading over my shoulder, and he wants me to tell you that morning runs aren\u2019t the same without you. Apparently I\u2019m too slow to present a real challenge.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>We\u2019ve sent along a scarf, please ignore the quality of the stitches. Vincent is learning to crochet, he says it\u2019s good for his finger dexterity, but he\u2019d have to have a modicum of skill with yarn for that to be the case. Nevertheless, the material is delightful and sure to keep you warm.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>We were pleased to hear you\u2019d ended up in Slytherin, you are certainly ambitious enough - but I like to imagine that I had a hand in nurturing your cunning. Tell us more about your roommates and your other friends. Are there any girls that have caught your eyes? Boys?\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Don\u2019t forget to study, Hadrian.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Love,</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Your mother.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat in Merlin\u2019s name is </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Abraxas gauffed as Harry dubiously held up what he assumed to be the scarf Vince had made. Though it more resembled a very long tangle of yarn, it </span>\n<em>\n<span>was</span>\n</em>\n<span> as soft as Ronnie promised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA scarf, I think.\u201d Harry folded the letter and placed it in his satchel, \u201cApparently my pops has taken up crochet. He is\u2026 not good at it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Orion lifted a corner of the \u2018scarf\u2019, \u201cI\u2019ll say. It looks like my mother\u2019s kneazles yarn ball.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus reached over to touch it, \u201cVery soft, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts, I suppose.\u201d Harry said, wrapping the monstrosity securely around his neck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not actually going to wear that.\u201d Rudolph sounded aghast.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Harry sniffed good naturedly at him, \u201cI think it\u2019s rather sweet of him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI agree.\u201d Melani Greengrass added from beside him, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice of him to think of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Thank</span>\n</em>\n<span> you, Melani.\u201d Harry smiled, ignoring Rudolph\u2019s offended scoff.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry was, honestly, very touched by the gift.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The longer he spent in the past, the more he came to think of Vince and Ronnie as his parents. They cared for him, taught him, and inquired after his wellbeing. And now they were sending him gifts - little things to remind him they cared. It was all he could do to not burst into tears.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d pen out a letter to send home later.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie had been overjoyed to hear he\u2019d been placed in the snake den - Harry suspected this was due to a bet they thought he didn\u2019t know about, Ronnie had bet Slytherin and Vince had put his money of Gryffindor - and wanted to know all about his experience so far. Vince had mostly just asked if he was keeping up with his exercise and if he\u2019d been having any trouble.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d been happy to report a yes and no respectively to Vince\u2019s questions, as well as filling Ronnie in on as much Hogwarts gossip as he could.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which was a lot. Apparently sewing time was also designated gossip time, who knew?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadrian!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry perked up at the sound of Fleamonts voice. Said boy was standing by the entrance to the great hall, quidditch gear in hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to play a friendly game, you want in?\u201d He shouted across the hall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shot him a thumbs up in response, shouting back would be far too undignified for a Slytherin, even one like him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, see y'all later then.\u201d He said to his housemates, receiving a chorus of goodbye\u2019s and eyerolls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to play that game with the lions, of all people.\u201d Riddle piped up from where he\u2019d been sitting in front of Harry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry shrugged, \u201cStuff it, Riddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do have to agree with Tom,\u201d Orion frowned, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Must</span>\n</em>\n<span> you associate with </span>\n<em>\n<span>them</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know,\u201d He said, swinging his satchel over his shoulder and standing up, \u201cThey say the exact same thing about y\u2019all. They\u2019re just people, and they\u2019re fun. I like them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lucretia sighed and shook her head, \u201cHow you didn\u2019t end up in Hufflepuff is the world's greatest mystery.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry spun on his feet, whipping his wand out and placing it against Riddle's throat before he even fully registered who had followed him. He\u2019d heard the footsteps, of course, but he hadn\u2019t the faintest clue as to who was stalking him through the library.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He should have known.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRiddle,\u201d Harry greeted, he didn\u2019t remove his wand, \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI misjudged you -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle narrowed his eyes, \u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>misjudged</span>\n</em>\n<span> you. You are clearly more powerful than I gave you credit for, and you have my apologies for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom made a sound in the back of his throat that was a cross between a groan and a growl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t you have </span>\n<em>\n<span>anything</span>\n</em>\n<span> to say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you </span>\n<em>\n<span>want</span>\n</em>\n<span> me to say, Riddle?\u201d Harry cursed the fact that Riddle was tall enough to practically tower over him, even with the height he\u2019d gained from the blood adoption. He had to tilt his head backwards just to meet Tom\u2019s eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>want</span>\n</em>\n<span> you to join me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Excuse</span>\n</em>\n<span> me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJoin me, Peverell. Join the Knights of Walpurgis and help us cleanse the wizarding world.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRiddle, dear.\u201d Harry said slowly, \u201cDo I </span>\n<em>\n<span>look</span>\n</em>\n<span> like a blood supremist to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey are ruining our world.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not their fault,\u201d his voice turned softer, gentler, and he lowered his wand, \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s any classes for them to learn our traditions and culture, and all y\u2019all sneer and hex them when they try and ask you for help. How are they supposed to learn?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom scowled, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I</span>\n</em>\n<span> learned.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed right in his face, \u201cYou, Riddle, are an incredibly terrifying being of superior intellect. You cannot seriously hold the average muggleborn to the same standard?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI - well.\u201d He huffed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, \u201cI agree that way of life needs to be preserved, Riddle. Just\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can get behind what you\u2019re planning to do to achieve that goal.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry could practically see the thoughts churning in Tom\u2019s head. He\u2019d taken a risk, just now, revealing his thoughts and feelings on the topic. Despite his rather open friendships with many muggleborn students, he\u2019d never formally declared his beliefs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that was what he\u2019d just done: a declaration of intent.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom could turn from him totally. He could give up on Harry so easily - and Harry hated how horrible that thought made him feel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, Riddle said, \u201cTom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCall me Tom.\u201d He said, \u201cI will consider what you have said.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then, Tom,\u201d This was going better than he\u2019d ever considered, \u201cYou may call me Hadrian.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom took a step back, and Harry really hadn\u2019t noticed that they\u2019d practically been standing chest to chest until Tom suddenly wasn\u2019t there anymore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at Dinner?\u201d Tom said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry agreed, breathless \u201cYes, I suppose you will.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Pomona said, leaning against him in a way that would make most Slytherins blush, \u201cI hear you\u2019re finally calling Riddle by his first name.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAw, not you too, Mona.\u201d Harry groaned, tossing his quill onto his unfinished Charms assignment, \u201cThe girls didn\u2019t let up for a moment on Saturday.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow year, this is the biggest gossip since Polly got knocked up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPolly from Gryffindor?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed, \u201cPoor girl, her parents forced her to marry the guy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry scoffed, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re preaching to the choir, mate.\u201d Pomona visibly shook herself out of that train of thought, \u201cAnyway, what happened with you? I thought you hated Riddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry nodded at her, \u201cI did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe listened to me, I suppose.\u201d Harry tilted his head, \u201cI argued on behalf of muggleborns and he listened - even </span>\n<em>\n<span>Orion</span>\n</em>\n<span> still gets into hissy fits whenever I even mention my muggleborn friends.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pomona narrowed her eyes at him, then smiled wide \u201cOhh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry inquired sharply, he did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> like that look in her eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou like him!\u201d Pomona said victoriously, \u201cJackie owes me a galleon!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t feel bad at all when he shoved her out of her chair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry wasn\u2019t quite sure whether Hogwarts had faced a sharp decline in the local snake population over the next five decades, or if the scaly buggers were drawn in by the heir of Slytherins presence, but he could scarcely walk for ten minutes before spotting a nest or two.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d lasted all of four months, right up until a week before the Christmas hols, before news got out that he could talk to snakes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus and him had been running early on a Saturday morning. The boy had taken to joining him on the weekends, so Harry took it as an opportunity to do a more relaxed routine so as to not overwhelm Cygnus.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d just finished their last set when Cygnus had tripped right over an adder snake. He\u2019d yelped, jumping backwards so violently he\u2019d landed himself on his ass. The snake, for her part, had cursed Cygnus out so beautifully and vibrantly that Harry couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>That was amazing</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Harry said, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Truly inspired.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The adder bobbed her head, making a sound that Harry associated with an offended sniff, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>See that your hatchling learns not to stomp all over the place.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s not my hatchling, more like a nestmate.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The adder was not impressed,</span>\n<em>\n<span> \u201cIf he does that again, I will bite him.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sobered up slightly, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I will see to it that he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The adder nodded and slithered away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou - you just\u2026\u201d Cygnus stuttered, pointing back and forth between Harry and the snake. Eventually a strangled noise left his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, Cygnus.\u201d Harry sighed, \u201cI am a parselmouth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus frowned, and Harry caught a glimmer of hurt in his eyes, \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you </span>\n<em>\n<span>tell</span>\n</em>\n<span> me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not that big of a deal outside of Britain.\u201d Harry sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus blinked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cParselmouths are a dime a dozen in India, even America has a few hundred of us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I thought\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat it was a Slytherin line specific skill and only Salazar\u2019s descendant could possess the trait?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI - yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich is exactly </span>\n<em>\n<span>why</span>\n</em>\n<span> I didn\u2019t tell anyone, I didn\u2019t want to set tongues wagging.\u201d Harry reached out to help him up, grinning when Cygnus didn\u2019t even hesitate to grab it, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start looking outside your little bubble of the world, kid. There\u2019s more out there then what your parents have told ya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cygnus still looked fairly shell shocked, but nodded slowly, like he was actually thinking about what Harry had said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, by the end of the week everyone and their mother knew he was a parselmouth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No matter how much Cygnus looked up to Harry, there was no way the boy would be able to keep that juicy bit of gossip from his cousins, and then they\u2019d tell their friends and everything would spiral from there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unlike his second year, people looked at him with interest and slight awe, rather than fear and disgust. He\u2019d lost count of the times he\u2019d had to deny any relation to the Slytherin bloodline in the days before the Hogwarts train left for London. By the time Riddle approached him he\u2019d had it up to here with the questions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook,\u201d Harry said shortly, before the other boy even opened his mouth, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>, I am a Parslemouth. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No</span>\n</em>\n<span>, I am not related to Salazar Slytherin. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>, that is possible. Do you have any other damn questions?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle looked more amused by his outburst than offended, which somehow only served to irritate Harry further.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s good to meet another parselmouth.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>he said and Harry blinked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d known, of course, that Tom Riddle was a parselmouth. He\u2019d just never expected the boy to so easily divulge that information.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry smiled slowly, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>yes. Yes it is.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His arrival back to London was met with a cheerful group hug from both Ronnie and Vince. They\u2019d practically ambushed him the moment he\u2019d stepped out of the train, all but tackling him to the floor with laughs and forehead kisses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh we </span>\n<em>\n<span>missed</span>\n</em>\n<span> you,\u201d Ronnie pulled him in for a second hug, \u201csweet boy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry was grinning so brightly that his cheeks hurt, \u201cI missed you guys too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadrian!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry turned his head at the sound of his name, seeing Orion and Lucretia leading two people he assumed were their parents. Orion bowed to Vince and Ronnie while Lucretia offered her hand for a light shake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry bowed to both Lord and Lady Black, \u201cMerry meet.\u201d He said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet, heir Peverell.\u201d Lord Black inclined his head, offering his hand to Vincent, \u201cLord Peverell, Lady Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Both Vince and Ronnie gripped his offered wrist, repeating the gesture with Lady Black.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet,\u201d Vincent said, \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy family and I wish to extend an invitation to our annual yule ball.\u201d Lord Black said after a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent smiled kindly at him, \u201cWe accept your invitation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lord Black passed him a slip of card, \u201cThis will act as a portkey to our manor. We will see you then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood bye!\u201d Lady Black offered before the entire family apparated away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The three Peverells blinked in surprise at the abrupt exit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry said after a beat, \u201cThat was interesting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStronger Harry!\u201d Vincent shouted from the sidelines, \u201cRonnie is barely putting half her power into those spells!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry grunted as Ronnie shot spell after spell at his rapidly dwindling shields. Bloody fucking hell. He\u2019d forgotten just how impressive both his guardians were on the dueling ground, a couple of months of dealing with fifteen year olds and he\u2019d fallen behind on his training.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie shot a purple spell which he knew to be painful as hell and Harry dodged. Twisting away rather than relying on his shield to protect him. Ronnie was entirely on the offensive at this point. They\u2019d been at it for fifteen minutes, and she\u2019d gained the upper hand after five.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was honestly surprised he lasted as long as he had.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie whispered a spell and Harry knew it was over for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If either of his guardians had to actually say a spell out loud, then that spell was more than likely to be far too powerful for him to block.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A brilliant white light poured out from Ronnie\u2019s wand, forming a whip of pure magic that she easily flicked. It shattered his shields on impact and wrapped itself around his leg, yanking him forwards and up until he was hanging upside down with his wand lying on the floor where he\u2019d dropped it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie wasn\u2019t even sweating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry sighed, not even surprised. \u201cI\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>never</span>\n</em>\n<span> going to beat you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Ronnie said, releasing the spell and watching as he dropped to the floor, \u201cI have nearly twenty years of dueling experience. You have two. It\u2019ll just take time, that\u2019s all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTime I don\u2019t have!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh that\u2019s hogwash,\u201d She said, \u201cYou are well ahead of anyone in your age group, hell I\u2019d wager you\u2019re more advanced than the entire auror department.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s right kid,\u201d Vince came forward and helped him to his feet, \u201cYou can\u2019t judge your progress against us. We were specialised hit wizards, you are a student - albeit a rather extraordinary one. Were it not for your fame and the whole time travel thing, I\u2019m sure the organisation would have approached you as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs is, you\u2019re learning from some of the best in the business.\u201d Ronnie finished, \u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry puffed out his cheeks and blew the air out, \u201cAlright, fine. Give me ten minutes and we can go again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie smiled, \u201cfive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello Hadrian.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry inclined his head, \u201cRiddle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boy in question stood in front of him wearing midnight blue dress robes that made him look entirely too handsome.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Around them, the Black yule ball was in full swing. Crystalline snowflakes and little magical flurries decorated the entirety of the ball room, creating an utterly gorgeous scene. Couples were spinning and swaying on the dance floor, and Harry couldn\u2019t look away from Tom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you thought about what I\u2019ve said?\u201d Tom said, holding out his hand to Harry, palm up - an offer to dance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry placed his hand in Tom\u2019s and allowed him to lead him to the dancefloor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you thought about what </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019ve</span>\n</em>\n<span> said?\u201d Harry echoed, placing one hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder and distinctly </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> shivering when Tom put a hand lightly on his hip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom was leading the dance, Harry easily followed, \u201cI have.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI suppose you are\u2026 correct.\u201d The admission seemed almost painful, causing Harry to laugh lightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so difficult to get out, now was it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Riddle snorted, \u201cI asked around. Asked the purebloods exactly what their problem was with mud-muggleborns.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd they said exactly what I said?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey said exactly what you said.\u201d Tom confirmed, \u201cI will admit I had never considered the motivation behind their hatred.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could tell,\u201d Harry said, \u201cAnd how has this information affected your plans.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe need to educate them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cObviously. Have you put any thought into </span>\n<em>\n<span>how</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d Tom said, twirling Harry out before pulling him back to his chest, \u201cBecause </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> already have.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Damn him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was right, of course. Harry had been subtly teaching the more open-minded of the muggleborns both wizarding culture and traditions, and he had plans for a magical primary school that his parents were currently working on introducing to the Wizengamot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI never said I\u2019d join you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou never said you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The song came to a close and they bowed to each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will not be your servant.\u201d Harry said seriously as they made their way off the dancefloor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou do not have to be a follower to join me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry must have misheard, \u201cPardon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom smiled, \u201cYou could lead. </span>\n<em>\n<span>With</span>\n</em>\n<span> me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI -\u201d Harry must have been gaping because Tom\u2019s smile grew gentler. The future dark lord lightly tapped the bottom of his chin, closing his mouth for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThink about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And with that he disappeared into the crowd, leaving Harry to recover in peace.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A peace that was interrupted less than twenty seconds later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSweet Circe!\u201d Lucretia said next to his ear, \u201cI have </span>\n<em>\n<span>never</span>\n</em>\n<span> seen such an intense foxtrot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what just happened.\u201d Harry mumbled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell </span>\n<em>\n<span>I</span>\n</em>\n<span> am,\u201d Walburga suddenly appeared on his other side. \u201cI\u2019m sure Riddle is looking for your father to secure a betrothal contract right this second.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Harry yelped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh don\u2019t act like that, Hadrian,\u201d Lucretia swatted his shoulder, \u201cHe\u2019s hardly the first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>What</span>\n</em>\n<span>?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lucretia hummed, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that cousin Pollux offered your parents quite the sum for your hand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blinked, shellshocked, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Why</span>\n</em>\n<span> is this the first I\u2019m hearing of this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh they refused, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Lucretia patted his hand, \u201cThey said something or another about you choosing your own spouse, you lucky bastard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blew out a breath of relief, \u201cOh thank god.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Walburga scowled, \u201cI\u2019m set to marry Orion, can you believe it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he\u2019s your </span>\n<em>\n<span>cousin</span>\n</em>\n<span>!\u201d Harry said. He\u2019d known, of course, that this was coming. But perhaps his influence would be enough to spare both his friends the pain of marrying each other. \u201cDo you even know what effect that would have on your children?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Walburga turned a sharp eye to him, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bingo.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry fought down a smirk. If nothing else, the wizarding world cared about their children.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know that you acquire traits from both your parents, right?\u201d Harry continued when both girls nodded, \u201cSo when two people who are closely related, such as </span>\n<em>\n<span>cousins</span>\n</em>\n<span>, have children together there is a decreased amount of genetic diversity in the child.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGenetic diversity?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a muggle term,\u201d Harry rolled his eyes at their identical scowls, \u201cGrow up, both of you. They have done far more research into this than we have. They have proven over and over that inbreeding causes an uptick in genetic disorders, infant mortality and a decrease in fertility. Most muggle governments actually have </span>\n<em>\n<span>laws</span>\n</em>\n<span> against marrying family\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Walburga muttered hollowly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you think most pureblood families struggle to have more than two children per generation, while families like the Weasleys, who often take in new blood, are known to be hyper fertile.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Walburga dragged a hand through her carefully done up hair, \u201cOh, Merlin. Hadrian you said there was research done?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nodded, \u201cLots of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCould you owl some of it to me?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe as well, please.\u201d Lucretia said, \u201cPerhaps my parents won\u2019t be so eager to sell my hand after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll have it for you by tomorrow evening.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Walburga reached forwards and gripped his hand, \u201c</span><em><span>Thank</span></em> <em><span>you</span></em><span>, Hadrian.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnytime, Walburga.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of the ball was rather uneventful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Three more wizards and at least fifteen witches managed to corral him onto the dance floor. Now that Walburga had cottoned him onto the fact that he was considered one of the most eligible bachelors in Britain, the thinly veiled flirtations of his partners no longer went over his head, leaving him feeling rather awkward for the majority of the evening.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Throughout the night Harry could practically feel Tom\u2019s eyes burning into him whenever he was dragged into a dance and he almost wept for relief when Vincent found him and informed him that it was time to head home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Peverells bid the Black family farewell and used the floo network to get back home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI cannot believe you guys didn\u2019t tell me that people want to </span>\n<em>\n<span>marry</span>\n</em>\n<span> me!\u201d Harry said as soon as they closed the floo connection.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie laughed, right in his face, \u201cHoney, have you </span>\n<em>\n<span>looked</span>\n</em>\n<span> in the mirror? You\u2019re the handsome, powerful, heir to one of the most powerful families in Britain. Of </span>\n<em>\n<span>course</span>\n</em>\n<span> people want to marry you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI still feel I should have been informed.\u201d He pouted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d Vince said, \u201cWe\u2019ve told everyone the same thing: you\u2019ll be choosing your own spouse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you. For that.\u201d Harry muttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie ruffled his hair and grinned mischievously, \u201cThough, we did get a rather interesting request this evening.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry groaned, already knowing where this was going.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vincent smirked at his wife, \u201cYes, from a young gentleman: a mister Tom Riddle. I was almost tempted to say yes after seeing the two of you dance together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDad!\u201d Harry cried, swatting him with the nearest available pillow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They all laughed before freezing as one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou called me\u2026\u201d Vince said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry swallowed the lump in his throat. He\u2019d thought of them both as parental figures for months now, but that was the first time he\u2019d said it out loud without an audience.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that - I </span>\n<em>\n<span>do</span>\n</em>\n<span> think of you, both of you, as my parents.\u201d Harry stuttered through, \u201cWould - do you mind if I\u2026?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Harry,\u201d Vince said, throwing his arms around his son and pulling him in for a hug, \u201cOf course you can call me \u2018dad\u2019. It would be an honor to be your father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ronnie joined the hug, circling her arms around both of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry felt loved.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadrian!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWalburga, Lucretia!\u201d Harry smiled in response, \u201cMerry meet, the both of you. How was the rest of your break?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry meet,\u201d The girls said in sync.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was lovely.\u201d Orion said as he and Cygnus came up behind Harry, and the five of them clambered into a carriage together, the boys greeted Harry as they got in. \u201cWalburga and I are no longer engaged!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry's grin momentarily faltered - had he just meddled his godfather out of existence? - but looking at Orion and Walburga cheerfully celebrating the dissolution of their betrothal, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to regret it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d been in the past for months now, almost certainly making it so that certain people who\u2019d never have crossed paths in the original timeline had now met and fallen in love, possibly causing the birth of hundreds of children who should never have existed. He\u2019d probably erased just as many from history.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sirius had been a good man, he\u2019d loved Harry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Walburga and Orion didn\u2019t deserve to suffer through an unwanted marriage just so he could exist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCongratulations, you two.\u201d Harry smiled at them both.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFrom what I hear,\u201d Orion said, \u201cYou are the main reason for it. I cannot thank you enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOi!\u201d Walburga gently smacked his shoulder, \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m a horrible beast!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh come off it, Burga. You wanted to marry me even less than I wanted to marry you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She sniffed, \u201cI suppose.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire carriage burst into laughter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know, Hadrian,\u201d Lucretia pulled his attention, \u201cthat our parents have elected to share that research around. I think we\u2019re in for a wave of broken betrothals.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHappy to help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWelcome back, Students!\u201d Professor Merrythought said as soon as everyone was present, \u201cDon\u2019t bother sitting down, it\u2019s a practical lesson today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry grinned, Merrythought was honestly his all time favorite Hogwarts Professor - mostly because the ratio between practical and theory classes were 5:1.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, kiddies.\u201d She said with a grin, \u201cWho can tell me what the patronus charm is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A ravenclaw from the back got called on. \u201cIt\u2019s a light charm, Professor. Used to protect against dark creatures such as lethifolds and dementors, if performed correctly you\u2019d produce a partially tangible energy force, taking the shape of an animal that represents you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry stuck his hand in the air, speaking only when the professor nodded at him, \u201cActually, the Patronus charm would be classified under Grey magic. As it is highly dependent on your emotions even though it still feeds off latent magic. And your patronus may also change to reflect someone you love.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is correct Mr Peverell. Five points to both ravenclaw and slytherin.\u201d Professor Merrythought swirled her wand and shouted, \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A large black bear burst forward from her wand, taking a lap around the room before returning to the professors side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> is how you perform the spell, is anyone confident that they can produce a corporeal patronus?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When nobody answered, Harry hesitantly raised his hand up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr Peverell! Come forward and show us then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The crowd of students parted to allow him to walk forwards. He kept his stride steady, not portraying any of the sudden nerves he was feeling on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Peverell.\u201d The Professor said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry took a deep breath, recalling the first time Ronnie and Vince had told him they loved him, and said firmly, \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The familiar form of Prongs burst through his wand. The stag proudly reared his antlers, taking a gallop around the room before coming to nuzzle Harry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello there.\u201d Harry said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTen points to Slytherin! Well </span>\n<em>\n<span>done</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Mr Peverell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks Professor!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry let go of his hold on the magic and Prongs dissipated with a snort.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone else, practice the charm. You\u2019ll need to recall your fondest memory, something that fills you with joy, then cast the spell. Mr Peverell, help your peers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry wandered around, nudging a couple of his classmates in the correct direction, before he made his way to Tom, who couldn\u2019t seem to produce more than a smokey wisp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou seem to be having trouble, Tom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other boy growled, muttering something under his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI said,\u201d And it was barely higher than a whisper, \u201cI haven\u2019t got any happy enough memories.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook,\u201d Harry said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be something grand. One of my friends back in America, her happy memory was the first time her parents gave her muggle candy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom looked incredulous, \u201cAnd </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> was happy enough?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not the memory itself, Tom. It\u2019s what it meant to </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm,\u201d The other boy said, turning back to his task with a determined set to his frown. \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry gasped as what was definitely a basilisk flew out of Tom\u2019s wand. Gasps of shock echoed around the room as everyone paused to watch the snake make it\u2019s round before dissipating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did it!\u201d Harry grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFive points, Mr Riddle!\u201d Merrythought said cheerfully, \u201cThat\u2019s all the time we have today, class. Keep practicing, I expect to see some improvement next week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry walked out the door beside Tom, \u201cWhat memory did you use, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom looked at him for a moment and his lips quirked in the slightest of smiles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought of our dance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry blinked, \u201cYou -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d stopped dead in the hall, other students flowing around them until there was no one else besides them.Tom had his head dipped so that he could meet Harry\u2019s eyes without him having to tilt his chin back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry swallowed, watching as Tom tracked the movement of his throat like a predator who\u2019d finally cornered its prey.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everything felt intune to Tom. Like he was experiencing his own skin in relation to how close it was to Tom\u2019s, like a static electricity had formed between their two bodies, pulling them closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, Tom smiled, full and wide and </span>\n<em>\n<span>real</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It took Harry\u2019s breath away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve not made a decision yet, have you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry didn\u2019t trust his voice, if he even opened his mouth he\u2019d probably swear himself into Tom\u2019s eternal service, so he shook his head slowly instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Tom said, he didn\u2019t need to talk above a whisper, they were that close, \u201cI\u2019m not patient, Hadrian Peverell. But for you\u2026 I will wait.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He swept off without another word. The bastard didn\u2019t even look back to see Harry stumble backwards into the wall and sink to the floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d he mumbled to nothing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The agent was fucking right. That kind of charisma should be a crime, Harry couldn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>think</span>\n</em>\n<span> straight when they were alone together, especially not when Tom did that </span>\n<em>\n<span>thing</span>\n</em>\n<span> with his mouth. And God, Tom phrased it like it was only a matter of time before Harry accepted his offer - like it was bloody inevitable.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What\u2019s worse is that he was probably </span>\n<em>\n<span>right</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom Riddle was changing. Little by little he was becoming less of a monster carefully concealed behind a porcelain mask and more of an actual person. Harry knew it, hell, most of the school knew it. Their roommates' hands were shaking decidedly less since the start of the school year, likely from a lack of crucios cast in their directions, and the once unapproachable boy could actually be seen </span>\n<em>\n<span>laughing</span>\n</em>\n<span>. In </span>\n<em>\n<span>public</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The purebloods, tightly under his control, had started talking to muggleborns. Harry had honestly fallen flat on his face the first time he saw Rudolph laughing with Noreen, a hufflepuff muggleborn. With this development, house rivalry all but faded back to healthy levels of friendly competition.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry almost couldn\u2019t believe it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dumbledore's ever present scowl whenever he saw purebloods and muggleborns mixing was incredibly amusing, though. Most people, students and teachers alike, were confused by the transfiguration professors odd response to the end of hostilities between houses. Harry knew though, that he was mourning the loss of an easy following.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With the purebloods now being more receptive to any muggleborns who wanted to learn their ways, Dumbledore would never be able to act as their champion. As such, he\u2019d lost hundreds of fanatic followers - a number that was exponentially more if one considered all the future muggleborns.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All of Harry's initial concerns about the future death eaters were currently null and void - hell, half his concerns by way of Dumbledore had been taken care of already thanks to Tom - and Riddle had offered partnership. Not a place at his feet or behind him, a </span>\n<em>\n<span>partnership</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What the hell was holding him back?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Dear mother and father,</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I don\u2019t know what is wrong with me.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Before we broke for holidays Tom Riddle - yes, that Tom Riddle - asked me to join his little gang. I said no, of course, I have no desire to be a follower. And then he asked if I would be his </span>\n</em>\n<span>partner</span>\n<em>\n<span>, if you can believe it. He just told me to think about it. So I did.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I explained how unfair it is that purebloods just hate muggleborns whilst making it impossible for them to learn our way.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>And he </span>\n</em>\n<span>listened</span>\n<em>\n<span>.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I swear guys, he took my advice and now the purebloods are actually talking to muggleborns. I can barely believe this is happening. And then yesterday Tom asked me again and I almost said yes. I don\u2019t even know what I should be doing, I mean, he </span>\n</em>\n<span>has</span>\n<em>\n<span> changed.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>What do you guys think I should do?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Love,</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Hadrian.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Dear Hadrian,\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Honey, of course he\u2019s changed.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You are possibly the only person in the world who could knock Tom Riddle off his axis and turn him into a real boy. And you\u2019ve been laying the seeds for change for months, you really shouldn\u2019t be so surprised to see the fruits of your labour.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Accept his offer, dear.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Love,\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Your parents.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The O.W.Ls this time around were </span>\n<em>\n<span>so</span>\n</em>\n<span> much easier.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry breezed through all of the practicals, easily finished most of the theory sections - with the obvious exception of runes, which still insisted on being a pain in his fucking ass - and was done with it all without a sweat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His roommates, baring Tom, who was equally unflappable in the face of the second most important examinations they\u2019d ever take, could hardly stand to be in the same room as him in the week preceding the exams.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It honestly seemed no time at all before school was coming to a close.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTom.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry looked up from his book at the sound of Orion's voice to see Tom standing in the doorway of their compartment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello everyone.\u201d Tom said, glancing quickly around the compartment and catching his eyes, \u201cHadrian, could I steal you for a moment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry answered before he could think, \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom nodded, holding the door open for Harry as he placed the book on the couch and walked out after him. Tom led him to an empty compartment, not saying a word until the door was shut behind them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHadrian,\u201d He said, stepping into his now familiar position of far too close to Harry for comfort. \u201cI said I could wait, and I have, but I </span>\n<em>\n<span>need</span>\n</em>\n<span> an answer, one way or another.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom gaped, \u201cyes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will be your </span>\n<em>\n<span>partner</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Tom.\u201d Hadrian clarified, \u201cNothing less.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Tom was smiling so wide Harry would call it a grin if he wasn\u2019t referring to a would-be dark lord. He stepped closer and closer to Harry, backing him up until he was pressed against the compartment door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry all but whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said you wanted to be my partner?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom hesitated, \u201cIn all meanings of the word?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry gasped as Tom reached a slow hand up to gently cup his cheek.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI -\u201d Harry fumbled for the words, huffing at his own inability to form thoughts when Tom was this close and settled for grabbing the back of his neck, yanking him down so he could plant a firm kiss on his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom \u201chmffd\u2019 in surprise but kissed back instinctively. Harry wrapped his arms around Tom's neck while Tom gripped his hips so tightly it should have been painful. An intimate echo of the positions they had both taken in their dance at the Black ball.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If he was having trouble thinking clearly when Tom was talking to him before, his head was now entirely empty. He couldn\u2019t even tell you how long they\u2019d been kissing before they were eventually forced to separate for air. Tom rested his forehead against Harry\u2019s, the both of them breathing practically into each other's mouths.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then.\u201d Tom mumbled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughed lightly, \u201cyes, you idiot. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I don\u2019t know how you could possibly misinterpret th-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tom kissed him again to shut him up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"negligiblyfae.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">come say hi on tumblr</a>\n</p>"
