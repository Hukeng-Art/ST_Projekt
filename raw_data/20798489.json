  "text": "<p>For Peter Parker, normal has always been a relative term.</p>\n<p>At one point, his normal was coming home from kindergarten to a mom and a dad, just like any other kid. After the plane crash, his normal was coming home to Ben and May. Then it evolved into not coming home at all\u2014it was spending afternoons and late nights furiously trying to work out his powers in a desperate attempt to understand what, exactly, had happened to him during that field trip to Oscorp. When Ben died, that was his new normal. Mr. Stark barged into his life and his new normal hadn\u2019t exactly been <em>normal\u00a0</em>in the most common sense, but Avengers missions and late night movies with the team on the couch of the Avengers Compound were about as normal as a teenage vigilante was going to get.</p>\n<p>In the past month, Peter\u2019s normal changed again. After the bus and the gym and the general mess of a hostage situation, Peter\u2019s new normal is Spider-Man watch parties with added commentary from his decathlon team. It\u2019s Flash Thompson apologizing in the hallways and disappearing whenever Peter tries to talk to him. It\u2019s watching <em>Spider-Man Fails\u00a0</em>compilations and <em>Buzzfeed: Unsolved\u00a0</em>(all the while wondering how many were S.H.I.E.L.D or alien related) on the couch of the Avengers Compound while the actual Avengers mingle about their daily lives with the added benefit of an entire team of teenagers and one Mr. Harrington crashing at their place. It\u2019s a group of ordinary teenagers and their superhero friend trying to get through high school in addition to hiding one of the biggest secrets in their lives from just about everyone.</p>\n<p>The sound of a bell chimes.</p>\n<p>Normal is spending weekends practicing at the Avengers Compound in a fit of panic because the upcoming decathlon competition is only weeks away and there\u2019s been a <em>distinct\u00a0</em>lack of practice ever since the field trip. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbe rung first,\u201d MJ says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Abe has his hand positioned above the bell with an expression that could only be described as that of incredible confidence.</p>\n<p>Sally, his current partner for the 2 vs. 2 practice matchup, eyes him and says, \u201cI hope you actually know the answer to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Abe says. \u201cThe answer is Ruthenium.\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ looks down at her cards. She raises an eyebrow. \u201cWrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Abe says, incredulously. \u201cI studied my ass off. I\u2019m <em>pretty sure\u00a0</em>it\u2019s Ruthenium.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCindy, Charles?\u201d MJ asks. \u201cWant to steal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rutherfordium,\u201d Cindy says.</p>\n<p>As the point goes to Cindy and Charles\u2019 team, Abe\u2019s confidence crumbles before Peter\u2019s eyes. He looks down at his hands with a face full of dread, buries his face in his arms, and whispers a quiet <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage, please,\u201d Mr. Harrington sighs.</p>\n<p>Cindy and Charles muffle their laughter from the other side of the table where they\u2019re playing the opposing team. MJ, their card holder and decathlon leader, looks on impassively. The rest of the remaining team members that actually has shown up to practice, Peter included, hold back snickers from their position on the opposite couch. Mr. Stark and Mr. Harrington are chaperoning for the day, lounging on the opposing couch and watching the team. Whereas Mr. Stark always seems to find teenage antics amusing, Mr. Harrington has put up with them long enough and knows all of their bullshit by now.</p>\n<p>Sally pushes her bell away with a sigh. \u201cAlright, I give. Someone switch with me \u2018cause I need a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m rather fond of Badassium but that\u2019s a PR nightmare that Pepper still won\u2019t talk to me about,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cAlright, I have the cards. MJ, you\u2019re up.\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ passes the cards to Mr. Stark on her way up to the table. \u201cDon\u2019t skip cards again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt mixes them up,\u201d Mr. Stark says and points a finger at her. \u201cPrevents you from memorizing order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass when I have to sort them again,\u201d MJ corrects. \u201cNed, Betty, you\u2019re on deck for Charles and Cindy. Peter, you\u2019re on deck for Abe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Betty says. Ned gives her a slight nod but goes back to furiously working on his homework for Monday. Peter gives her a two fingered wave and makes exactly zero effort to get up from his spot.</p>\n<p>Weekends like these aren\u2019t, exactly, what one would call normal in any sense of the way. It\u2019s been four weeks since the episode on the bus and again in the gym\u2014one to recover, three more to start meeting at the Avengers\u2019 Compound for practice on Saturday mornings. Normally, Peter is at the\u00a0compound around this time anyways, but it would've have been quiet and peaceful. Maybe an Avengers cooking in the kitchen, if he\u2019s lucky that particular day. The added chaos of another eight teenagers and a teacher has taken more than a bit of adjustment.</p>\n<p>The Avengers have been welcoming, at least. Peter knows it isn\u2019t easy hosting a decathlon meeting, but the freshly baked cookies and the extra handwritten note cards on everything from the Spanish Inquisition to basic college algebra from a mysterious benefactor sure seemed to help.</p>\n<p>(Peter knows that it\u2019s a team effort\u2014he\u2019s walked into more than one suspicious meeting with a bunch of 3x5s spread out on the table and there\u2019s a whiteboard on the third floor that still has <em>Peter\u2019s Decathlon Team Welcoming Ideas </em>written in bold expo marker.)</p>\n<p>Sure, some are still a little uncomfortable\u2014Peter hasn\u2019t seen Rhodey here since Tuesday, Vision stays holed up in his room unless Wanda is with him, Sam doesn\u2019t really talk much when he <em>is </em>out\u2014but they\u2019re making an effort and Peter can\u2019t help but be a little grateful. The Avengers, through their tough exteriors and battle hardened personalities, really do care. They understand more than anyone that getting held hostage in a school gym after a bus explosion isn\u2019t <em>exactly\u00a0</em>something that a bunch of sixteen year olds can just walk off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Flash was on deck for Abe,\u201d Sally says. \u201cHe usually is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlash had something come up,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cHe won\u2019t be here today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s <em>supposed </em>to be here, right?\u201d Sally asks as if she hadn\u2019t noticed that Flash never showed up to begin with. \u201cHe\u2019s been skipping as much as Peter, lately.\"</p>\n<p>Peter feels he should be vaguely offended by this considering everyone here knows very well why he skips in the first place. He tells this to Sally. Sally ignores him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Betty barely looks up from her phone when she answers, \u201cHe said he\u2019d be here next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned pauses in his homework long enough to look up and catch Peter\u2019s eye. There\u2019s a silent question there, a <em>do you know anything? </em>but Peter just shrugs because, well, he hasn\u2019t seen Flash at <em>all\u00a0</em>recently. Even in school, there\u2019s a suspicious lack of spitballs in chemistry and being shoved into lockers during passing period. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing\u2014Peter is never going to complain about the lack of books knocked out of his hands\u2014 but it\u2019s new and more than a little weird, especially from someone with as much boundless determination to make his life a living hell as Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwfully convenient that Flash misses the third Avengers\u2019 practice for the third time in a row,\u201d Cindy drawls out sarcastically.</p>\n<p>Charles rolls his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s just avoiding it \u2018cause Peter\u2019s Spider-Man and he feels weird about being an asshole to his hero for, like, years.\u201d</p>\n<p>The team turns to look at Peter and Peter <em>freezes</em>. He flexes his hands into fists and tries to school his expression but Mr. Stark definitely notices if the look he\u2019s getting is anything to go by. Peter will definitely\u00a0have another talk later, which sucks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The exposed feeling of someone casually mentioning his alter-ego isn\u2019t new, exactly, but having a group of people other than the Avengers know his identity is more than a little uncomfortable. The past three weeks have been the biggest adjustment period that Peter\u2019s had to go through since getting his powers in the first place.</p>\n<p>Revealing his identity to the Avengers had been easy. After all, a group of superheroes knows how to react around other people with enhancements. Plus, it had been Mr. Stark who found and introduced them in the first place. For a while, Mr. Stark had been the buffer between Peter and the team until he slowly came out of his shell over the course of a few months, a few fights and more than a few shared post-battle movie nights.</p>\n<p>Revealing his identity to the team? Much harder. Even forgetting the trauma inducing hostage situation that forced Peter to reveal his identity in the first place, it just isn\u2019t the same. His decathlon team, while full of amazingly smart and bright people, are just normal kids. Much like Peter had been before the bite. They still don\u2019t really get this superhero stuff despite being more than willing to try. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust them, he <em>does\u00a0</em>trust them\u2014<em>really!\u2014</em>it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t know how to make sense of the new dynamic.</p>\n<p>Over the past four weeks, things have changed. The last of his teams\u2019 bruises and cuts were fading away. The residual shock had worn off. They're getting a little bit closer, a little more comfortable. Mr. Harrington had even mentioned off hand that even the other teachers noticed a sudden change in behavior in all of them.</p>\n<p>(Mr. Harrington assures Peter, later, that he\u2019s trying everything in his power to throw them off. Not even he would do anything to risk Peter\u2019s secret.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a big change for all of them; going from nerd group to secret superhero support group all because of a squid-like dude with a rocket launcher and two cronies who were looking for a quick buck and didn\u2019t mind holding a group of high-school kids hostage. Peter goes from making sure absolutely <em>no one\u00a0</em>in school is suspicious to <em>oh my god please stop making the Spider-Man hand when I\u2019m around\u00a0</em><em>because someone is definitely going to notice\u00a0</em>at least twice a day.</p>\n<p>The little tidbit about Flash doesn\u2019t help either because Peter <em>knows\u00a0</em>that Flash loves (loved?) Spider-Man. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s unaware of it\u2014the fact that Flash was consistently an asshole to Peter but waxed poetry about Spider-Man had been the punchline of several shared jokes between him and Ned\u2014but Flash apologized weeks ago and Peter had thought they were finally on the way to some sort of truce. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently not, if Flash is avoiding him. Peter\u2019s smart enough to realize that there\u2019s probably a little more to this situation than he realizes. With a little determination, he thinks that he might be able to mend something there. He\u2019s no sherlock, but he\u2019s pretty damn good at getting to the bottom of things. It comes with being a vigilante, fighting crime and all of that interesting stuff.</p>\n<p>\u201cLay off your teammate, please,\u201d Mr. Harrington calls. Charles snorts but covers it with a cough and doesn\u2019t say anything else. \u201cEspecially if he is not here to defend himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cindy relents with a huff and says, \u201cIf Thor shows up while we practice and Flash misses it I\u2019m rubbing it in his face for the rest of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which is, admittedly, fair. Whenever Thor shows up at the compound, Peter feels like rubbing it in a bit too. It\u2019s not his fault that Thor, god of Thunder and of any hairstyle he pleases, is just so <em>cool. </em>Even Mr. Stark has finally let up on Thor being Peter\u2019s favorite Avenger, because, <em>really</em>, who else would it be?</p>\n<p>Mr. Harrington apparently thinks something similar because he only shakes his head and lets the subject drop. The rest of the practice, despite some rocky answers and general teenage bullshit, goes rather smoothly and without further mention of Peter\u2019s current number one problem that is Flash Thompson.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Long after his decathlon team leaves for the weekend, Peter is left with cleaning up the large mess they made in the common area. It\u2019s fine with him, truthfully, as it gives him something to do with his hands. Plus it\u2019s another way he\u2019s found that he can say <em>thank you for not telling the entire world that I, Peter Parker, am Spider-Man </em>without actually having to say words to his teammates<em>.\u00a0</em>He\u2019s tried, in the past, to express his gratitude verbally on multiple occasions. MJ punched him for being an idiot. Abe said he\u2019d do the same for any of them so it\u2019s no big deal, really.</p>\n<p>Peter folds the makeshift table, cleans up the wrappers and throws them in the trash. He takes the multitude of decathlon cards, stacks them and stores them underneath the coffee table for next time. By the time he finishes making the place spotless once again, it\u2019s almost ten at night and there\u2019s absolutely no one around the common area.</p>\n<p>As per Parker luck, that\u2019s when things go to hell.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly sure what comes over him at that point; one moment he\u2019s fine and the next there\u2019s a suffocating feeling in his chest and it feels hard to breathe. His hands shake and he tries to chase away the feeling of helplessness in his mind. He feels his gut churn and his vision dance and he <em>knows\u00a0</em>what\u2019s happening\u2014panic attacks are nothing new\u2014but that doesn\u2019t stop the annoyance in the back of his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Peter whispers because he does <em>not\u00a0</em>have time to deal with random trauma induced bullshit when absolutely <em>none </em>of his triggers are here. This is awful. Peter hates it. He wants a refund, please. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Of course\u00a0</em>Mr. Stark that chooses that exact moment to enter the room. It\u2019s always Mr. Stark. It\u2019s like he has a built in radar for when Peter\u2019s suffering from panic attacks in the dead of night with absolutely <em>no trigger in sight, seriously what the fuck, brain</em>.</p>\n<p>Peter gives him the <em>one moment\u00a0</em>gesture with his hands and tries to focus on his breathing so his useless brain could start figuring out that he is not, in fact, crushed under a building or on a bus or held hostage in a gym or in an alley.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark approaches him anyways, slowly, and sits him on the couch. It takes a hot minute, but Peter eventually manages to get his breathing under control and his hands to stop shaking which he counts as a win.</p>\n<p>Panic attacks are not, exactly, uncommon. Especially not in Peter\u2019s line of work. He\u2019s been having them long before he became Spider-Man. Losing Ben had been the start. It\u2019s just added up from there.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter tells Mr. Stark. Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t respond and chooses to give him a vaguely familiar look. Peter balks and says, voice tight, \u201cPlease no more are-you-okay talks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark gives him the most unimpressed look he can muster. \u201cMaybe if you actually talked to someone else about this then I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI talk to Sam,\u201d Peter protests. He\u2019s not one to look away from the gift that is a free licensed therapist with superhero experience, \u201cI talk to my team too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make jokes with your team as you all silently suffer under the weight of your shared trauma,\u201d Mr. Stark corrects which, yeah, fair. \u201cSam is good though. Keep talking to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter huffs. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man,\u201d Peter says. He really wishes he could explain why, exactly, he should not be having panic attacks at 10pm for absolutely no reason. Unfortunately for Peter, he\u2019s never really been good with the whole communication-with-words thing. \u201cI should be, I dunno, out saving people right now. I should be\u2014I should be doing <em>something</em>. Not sitting around \u2018cause I had a panic attack.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>It doesn\u2019t feel like enough</em>, Peter wants to say but knows Mr. Stark will only say <em>it never does</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2014\u201d Mr. Stark says. He catches Peter before he can go on another verbal barf. \u201cNuh, uh. Listen for a sec before you start blaming yourself again. I\u2019ve been through a lot of bullshit, kiddo. I can\u2019t sleep, sometimes. Too many thoughts in my head so I\u2019m usually in the lab. It\u2019s hard to close my eyes sometimes. Cap doesn\u2019t sleep well either. He usually takes it out on the punching bags in the training room. Clint wanders the halls, Nat avoids people. Wanda stays holed up in her room. Bruce stays in his lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pauses, just for a second. He\u2019s not quite sure what to say, or how to respond. Luckily for him, Mr. Stark isn\u2019t quite done yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re a superhero,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cAnd just because you think you have a responsibility to be fine doesn\u2019t mean you are. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay not to be okay, kid. You don\u2019t have to keep pushing yourself to be something you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Peter admits and picks at the helm of his T-shirt. \u201cIt feels like I have to be, for everyone else \u2018cause they keep looking at me when this kinda stuff goes on.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very obvious to the both of them who <em>everyone else </em>refers to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and your team went through the ringer, Underoos,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cIt sucks. A bona fide disaster of a situation but you don\u2019t have to be the pillar of support for all of them. You\u2019re going to run yourself into the ground doing that. Instead, help where you can and let time and professionals do the rest. It\u2019ll take a while, but eventually things are going to start to change. The world continues. It doesn\u2019t always get better, but we move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if they\u2014if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cNo one will ever think less of you for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs through his nose, words jumbled in his mind and he thinks that he can\u2019t really process them even if he wants to. Instead, he opts for a simple, \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark lifts himself from the couch and offers Peter a hand. Peter takes it. \u201cGo to bed, kid. You look dead on your feet.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You look about the same,\u00a0</em>Peter wants to say but knows that Mr. Stark has worn eyebags like a fashion accessory long before Iron Man made his first appearance. Out loud, he says, \u201cNight, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Betty B</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@BBrant \u00b7 34m</span></p>\n<p>a buddy of mine saw spider-man take his shirt off in the shower and he said that spider-man had an eight pack. that spider-man was shredded</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[cindy]: hey guys check out this awesome video i made [spiderman-swinging-into-buildings.mov]</p>\n<p>[peter]: cindy why do you hate me</p>\n<p>[cindy]: i don\u2019t hate you</p>\n<p>[cindy]: also it has 100k views on youtube</p>\n<p>[charles]: congrats on being youtube famous :)</p>\n<p>[cindy]: thanks charles i knew i could count on you for support :)</p>\n<p>[abe]: its good thing i don\u2019t know spiderman personally or anything. wouldnt that would be embarrassing</p>\n<p>[cindy]: right?</p>\n<p>[michelle]: its pretty embarrassing</p>\n<p>[ned]: yeah dude being spiderman would suck right about now</p>\n<p>[peter]: guys</p>\n<p>[peter]: guys please i dont deserve this</p>\n<p>[betty]: i, for one, would just not swing into walls</p>\n<p>[betty]: rip to spiderman but im different</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter conveniently forgets that Ned is fiercely protective and ready to throw hands with just about anyone if it means keeping Peter safe. This also means that he is ready to throw hands with just about anyone if it meant keeping the <em>Spider-Man\u00a0</em>aspect safe, too.</p>\n<p>This, unfortunately, included his <em>Guy in the Chair\u00a0</em>title as well. If Peter let him, he\u2019s absolutely sure <em>Spider-Man\u2019s Guy in the Chair\u00a0</em>would be on Ned\u2019s college resum\u00e9 by now.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s why he can\u2019t say he\u2019s overly surprised when on his way to decathlon, walking down the empty hallways after school, he distinctly hears Ned\u2019s voice loudly proclaim, \u201cI want to let everyone know that I am Spider-Man\u2019s go-to Guy in the Chair and you will all have to pry that from my cold dead hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are sounds of protests almost immediately. Someone slams something on the table. Everyone shuts up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d MJ says. \u201cDoes anyone have anything actually productive to add?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Ned is Peter\u2019s Guy in the Chair then what does that make us?\u201d Sally says. She almost sounds like she\u2019s whining. \u201cWe need a title or <em>something</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rounds the corner and watches as his team, huddled together in the far table, starts to heatedly debate what they are, exactly, to Spider-Man. They don\u2019t notice him, too wrapped up in the own discussion to notice that Spider-Man is, in fact, standing only a few feet away and can hear every single word they\u2019re saying.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeenage mutant ninja support group,\u201d Charles says, then pauses to think. He tries again, \u201cTeenage mutant spider support group?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Cindy vetoes immediately.</p>\n<p>Abe taps his fingers on the table and asks, \u201cCan we be, like, getaway drivers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan anyone here actually drive?\u201d</p>\n<p>No, of course, not, because they\u2019re all from New York City and just barley sixteen. There\u2019s a muffled chorus of <em>no\u00a0</em>from around the table.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t even try to hide his snort. The entire team, with the exception of MJ (who doesn\u2019t care) and Flash (who still isn\u2019t here), turns to snap in his direction. It\u2019s very, very obvious that none of them even considered the fact that he has this super cool thing called super-hearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Peter,\u201d Ned says as if he doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s the exact reason they\u2019re having this mess of a conversation in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Peter,\u201d Abe says. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you heard literally all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter raises his eyebrow at him, not even dignifying that with a response. He drops his bag on the floor and lounges in the chair next to MJ which is rather daring considering he\u2019s two minutes late according to the library clock.</p>\n<p>MJ elbows him in the side, just because she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Betty says to break the silence. \u201cWhat are we, exactly? In the grand scheme of superheroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoral support,\u201d Peter answers but stops to actually think about it for a second and amends, \u201cBut only about half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>They start kicking up protests immediately\u2014\"What do you mean only <em>half </em>the time? This superhero support is a full time gig!\u201d\u2014but Peter is content to rummage through his bag an conveniently ignore the riot he\u2019s created. MJ loudly slams her textbook on the table. Once again, everyone stops talking.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re done with this enlightening conversation, we have decathlon to get to. Competition in a week and all that,\u201d MJ says. She turns to Peter, eyebrow raised. \u201cYou\u2019re late again.\u201d</p>\n<p>By two minutes. Peter debates the pros and cons of saying <em>screw it\u00a0</em>and leaving then and there. MJ, unfortunately, does not let him and Peter spends the rest of the afternoon laughing, answering questions and prepping for their first competition of the season in a mere six days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Charles</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@c.murph \u00b7 2d</span></p>\n<p>honestly lets just be happy that it was a spider that spiderman took inspiration from and not like, a naked mole rat. can u imagine. can you even imagine naked mole rat man</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[betty]: hey peter check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch/buzzedfeed-unsolved-area-51</p>\n<p>[peter]: PLEASE stop sending me buzzfeed unsolved links</p>\n<p>[peter]: i don\u2019t know anything</p>\n<p>[abe]: thats what the government wants u to think</p>\n<p>[peter]: just because ms natasha knew what happened in one episode does not not mean every episode is a government conspiracy</p>\n<p>[charles]: or does it</p>\n<p>[ned]: i think peter knows more than hes letting on and thats kinda uncool of him</p>\n<p>[peter]: ned you traitor</p>\n<p>[peter]: listen i know nothing. the only thing the avengers\u00a0tell me is</p>\n<p>[betty]: peter?</p>\n<p>[cindy]: oh my god hes dead</p>\n<p>[michelle]: sniped by the very organization he works for</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adjusting and pretending nothing happened four weeks ago is hard.</p>\n<p>After the attack, it took five days before any of them, besides Peter, could even come back to school. Most of the time it\u2019s fine; it\u2019s easy to conveniently forget hostage situations when stuck doing drills in calculus. However, gym was\u2014still very much is\u2014a huge adjustment. It had been fine for a while, due to gym renovations forcing gym to be held outside in the courtyard instead, but the new gym had opened back up a week ago and it hadn\u2019t been easy to willingly enter those double doors.</p>\n<p>His teammates are nowhere near\u00a0as good as hiding their absolute distain for the newly finished gym. Peter usually shares the period with Abe, Cindy, Ned, MJ and Flash but he\u2019s only seen three of them in the building during third period. Flash comes and goes, never staying long enough for Peter to catch him for a conversation. Abe\u2019s been trying, recently, but he\u2019s has a doctor\u2019s note from Dr. Cho saying that he does not need to be there unless he\u2019s feeling up to it. MJ\u2019s a little wary but she hides it well enough to do laps with no problem. Ned has always been confident enough if Peter\u2019s with him, so Peter\u2019s been forcing himself to suck it up and go anyways.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like they could just up and tell their teachers, either. Mr. Stark had very carefully buried everything that happened in the gym and parking lot. The cover story had been simple: the decathlon team had left for Stark Industries moments before Spider-Man crashed into the gym due to the usual big bad villain fighting. The parking lot and gym were both so damaged that they needed to be repaired. Mr. Stark, a benevolent benefactor, offered to step up and pay for any damages that had insured.</p>\n<p>Peter thinks it\u2019s quite possibly the stupidest cover story he\u2019s ever been conned into pretending. He tells his feelings to Mr. Stark. Mr. Stark says that his cover stories are never any better and Mr. Stark actually has the resources to back this one up which is, admittedly, a valid assessment.</p>\n<p>In the end, the story is all they have to go by. Peter sucks it up, shoves his hands in his pocket and, like he\u2019s done before, buries all his feelings as he walks towards third period gym class. It\u2019s as simple as getting through the day. Peter hopes, one day, that if he can flood himself enough then maybe gym might not be so bad.</p>\n<p>(It\u2019s unlikely to work. Peter\u2019s forced himself in enough collapsed buildings to know that flooding is, in fact, a very bad coping mechanism. It does not stop him from trying again anyways.)</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter! Hey, wait\u2014<em>shit</em>, you walk fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stops dead in the middle of the hallway. People bustle around him, rushing to get to their class in the fifteen minutes they have for passing period. When he turns, it\u2019s Abe that called his name.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Peter greets because it\u2019s not uncommon to walk to gym together but it\u2019s been a week since Abe tried to go to gym and Peter had figured it might be another week before he tried again so he\u2019s rather surprised to see him heading that direction.</p>\n<p>Abe is out of breath when he reaches Peter, panting like he\u2019d just run down the halls. He looks pretty worried if the furrowed brow and twisted frown is anything to go by. He grabs Peter\u2019s shoulder and yanks him in a less crowded hallway. Peter, for his part, lets himself be dragged along.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbe, hey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you check on Cindy for me?\u201d Abe asks then hesitates. Getting Peter\u2019s nod of encouragement, he continues, \u201cWe figured, y\u2019know, it\u2019s been a while so we were going to try gym again together but she just\u2014it wasn\u2019t a good day, I guess. I tried, but I can\u2019t find her and I\u2019ve been running around the school looking for her. You know how she gets about gym and I\u2019m,\u201d he pauses to take a breath. \u201cI\u2019m just worried, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her,\u201d Peter promises. The halls are cleaning out with the bell only seconds away. \u201cTell Coach Wilson I\u2019m sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Abe say with a sort of a bone-deep relief in his voice. \u201cI can go get Mr. Harrington so he can cover for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bell rings right as Peter shakes his head. \u201cIt would be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. I\u2019ll just skip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Abe relents. \u201cI\u2019m still going to head to gym, I think. Or try, at least. I can talk to Ned if it gets bad. You really are a lifesaver, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re a lifesaver, Peter\u00a0</em>has become somewhat of a joke in the group, but also very much not. It still brings a smile to his face as he and Abe part ways and start to walk back around the hall. He calls over his shoulder, \u201cSee you at practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLast practice until competition!\u201d Abe calls back. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one would miss it. MJ would personally destroy all of them if they tried.</p>\n<p>Peter takes a turn and the gym doors are nothing but a memory in the back of his mind. He hoists his backpack a little higher over his shoulder, notices the complete lack of people in the hallways, and starts his search for one Cindy Moon.</p>\n<p>Peter is no Daredevil, but years of being a vigilante on the streets and the added benefit of super-senses give him the benefit of the doubt when searching for wayward team members. The halls are mostly quiet, with everyone being in class, but Peter still tries extra hard not to be seen. It would be hard to explain to a teacher why he\u2019s sneaking around campus instead of\u00a0heading to gym class.</p>\n<p>Peter checks all the places he knows can hide a person\u2014changing into his suit for emergencies has left him with a rather good map for hiding spots\u2014but doesn\u2019t find her. He searches the entirety of the west and east wing of the school before combing through the north wing.</p>\n<p>It takes another couple of minutes before he hears something; a tiny little tapping sound from around the corner that definably isn\u2019t a student or teacher out of class. He takes off, rounds the corner and sees nothing except the stairway that leads up to the second story. It\u2019s a little disappointing and he almost leaves, but the tapping sound doesn\u2019t go away.</p>\n<p>When he actually <em>looks,\u00a0</em>Peter sees the corner of a backpack right behind the stairwell, hidden from view. The white and pink strap is more than familiar and more than a little welcoming right now.</p>\n<p>Peter walks towards the stairwell, looks behind it and, lo and behold, one Cindy Moon is curled up in the furthest corner, hidden from almost anyone who would pass her on the way to class.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s on her phone, scrolling through her Instagram feed or <em>something</em>. Overall, she doesn\u2019t look terrible. Her eyes are a little red, her breathing still a little uneven but Peter thinks that she\u2019s using her phone for a big enough distraction. She doesn\u2019t notice him at all until he gets about five or six feet away. When she looks up, there's no surprise in her expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Peter,\u201d her voice is a lot more subdued than usual, but she\u2019s not mad at him so Peter counts that as a win. \u201cDid Abe set you up to this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs since there really isn\u2019t any use hiding it. \u201cAbe\u2019s just worried. He\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighs and puts her phone away. Peter takes that as an invitation to sit on the dusty school floor next to her. He doesn\u2019t say anything, content to wait as long as she needs\u2014if she even wants to talk in the first place. For a while, she says nothing, just staring blankly at the wall in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really did want to try,\" she says eventually. \"Everyone else has been trying but I haven\u2019t been to gym once. Still can\u2019t look at a bus. I thought about switching school for a while I couldn\u2019t just\u2026leave, I guess. It\u2019s <em>stupid</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Peter says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>is</em>, though,\u201d she shakes her head, \u201cCan\u2019t get on a bus, can\u2019t look at pictures of guns, can\u2019t go to gym class. Everyone else can do those things and not think twice about them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not everyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not everyone else,\u201d Cindy agrees. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCindy,\u201d Peter tries. \u201cWhat happened was sucky. Like, truthfully, terrible. It\u2019s something that will never happen to most people. You\u2019re not them. They didn\u2019t have their bus explode when they were supposed to be going on a really cool field trip, but you did. They didn\u2019t get held hostage by the three scrooges, you did. They didn\u2019t throw a bunch of gym trash at Squidward to save me from getting a rocket launcher to the face\u2014that\u2019s all you. Which was pretty awesome, by the way. I still owe you for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cindy huffs out a laugh. He can tell she doesn\u2019t quite believe him, but she relents anyways. The redness in her eyes is already fading so it\u2019s marginally harder to tell that she had a breakdown behind the school staircase.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>was\u00a0</em>pretty cool,\u201d She sighs and leans back up against the wall. There\u2019s the tiniest smile on her face when she says, \u201cYou\u2019re really good at this stuff, y\u2019know, Peter?</p>\n<p>He blinks, confused, \u201cGood at what?\u201d</p>\n<p>She waves her arms around sporadically, \u201cDealing with all of <em>this</em>. Being a superhero. Hiding you identity. I never would\u2019ve known if that shit hadn\u2019t gone down. If I were you, I\u2019d be constantly worried, I guess. Freaked out. I would\u2019ve slipped up and quit at the beginning. But you still go out every night just to save others when I can\u2019t even walk down to the gym without having a panic attack,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter thinks, privately, of his latest panic attack in the Avengers\u2019 common room. He thinks of every time he\u2019s closed his eyes only to see the vulture, or a plane crashing, or a building falling. How often he\u2019s woken up with Uncle Ben\u2019s face in his mind and the feeling of blood on his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not, really,\u201d he says in lieu of trying to explain. She obviously doesn\u2019t believe him but he can\u2019t find the words to say that his brain function is actually pretty awful too. Instead, he pushes himself off of the cold ground and offers her a hand. \u201cYou want to go to the library?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cindy hesitates for a second, but takes his hand so he can pull her up from the floor. \u201cI guess it\u2019s better than the gym.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than the gym,\u201d Peter agrees.</p>\n<p>The walk to the library is rather uneventful. Class is still in session for another twenty minutes, so the hallways are eerily silent. Peter and Cindy avoid any and all teachers, since the lack of hall pass would be rather damning, and instead take the longer way to the library just as a precaution.</p>\n<p>The library is the most lax with hall passes so it\u2019s no surprise that the librarian just waves them through without bothering to check.</p>\n<p>It <em>is\u00a0</em>more of a surprise when Peter sees Charles near the back, browsing a plethora of thick textbooks because he knows for a fact that Charles has chemistry with Ms. Warren during third period.</p>\n<p>Charles spots them almost immediately and waves them over. Cindy gives him a two fingered wave back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Peter greets. \u201cI thought you had chem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a term paper due in a couple of weeks and since she\u2019s giving us class time to work on it, I asked if I could go to the library to look for references,\u201d Charles gestures to the hoard of chemistry books littered around the floor and makes a face. \u201cWhat about you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGym,\u201d Cindy says.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flicker of understanding in his expression when he says, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cMind if we stay here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The expression is gone within a moment and Charles gives them both an easy smile. \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t mind harboring hall pass fugitives. I\u2019ll give you a warning if I see a teacher coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cindy sighs in relief and slides to the floor, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet for the next few minutes. Peter helps Charles groom through chemistry book after chemistry book looking for citations and useable information. Cindy doesn\u2019t say much, content to curl up against the bookshelf and keep to herself. She\u2019s back on her phone again, scrolling through. Sometimes\u00a0she types something out or gives a small smile. Charles side-eyes her every once in a while just to make sure she\u2019s alright</p>\n<p>(Not that any of them are <em>alright</em>, but, well, alright has always been a relative term.)</p>\n<p>At some point, both Peter and Charles join her on the floor surrounded by papers, discarded pencils and mounds of books. They don\u2019t say anything, but honestly there\u2019s never really any need. Charles and Cindy have enough on their minds to figure out themselves and Peter\u2019s never been one to push buttons. Especially when those buttons are created via bus explosion and result from subsequent trauma of said bus explosion.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only five minutes left until class ends. Charles sighs, pushes back the books and leans against the book case. \u201cThis sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cindy snorts but hides it with a cough. Peter isn\u2019t quite sure if he\u2019s referring to the pile of chemistry books or the impending doom of negative thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I feel as if I can get through the day, y\u2019know?\u201d Charles elaborates. \u201cJust be a normal teenager or something. Then sometimes it\u2019s like my brain sets itself off and it gets hard to breathe and I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d he trails off and huffs in frustration. \u201cThis really sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is quick to console. \u201cHey, it\u2019s cool, don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing better than I am, Charles,\u201d Cindy says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even managed to walk towards the gym. You\u2019re still in gym practice.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Take\u00a0</em><em>one step at a time, </em>Sam said once when Peter had first confided with him,\u00a0<em>It\u2019s not about doing better than each other. Not everyone\u2019s step is the same length. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, kinda,\u201d Cindy continues. There\u2019s a pink tingle to her cheek and she\u2019s not meeting either their eyes. \u201cBecause Peter goes through this bullshit every night and it doesn\u2019t stop him. Spider-Man always gets back on his feet. I can\u2019t handle it once, right? I get panic attacks that are bad enough that I have to go skip class. That\u2019s humiliating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Peter tries, \u201cI have panic attacks too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles looks at him like it\u2019s the first time seeing him. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid. They don\u2019t ever really go away, you just get better at hiding them.\u201d</p>\n<p>They seem surprised. Peter wonders how good of an actor he is for them to never realize he\u2019s a big pile of human anxiety with the added benefit of some nice superhero-related and other general trauma.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Charles whistles. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always thought\u2026\u201d Cindy stares at him before shaking her head. \u201cNever mind. You know you can come to us too, right, Peter? If you\u2019re ever feeling like a steaming pile of garbage?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always feel like that,\u201d Peter says but he\u2019s smiling. \u201cThanks, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter says. He does. He\u2019s there for his team as much as his team is there for him. \u201cAnd I mean it too when I say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The period ends, kids come streaming from their classes. Peter and Charles and Cindy stay tucked up amongst the bookshelves, feeling lighter than they have in days all the while laughing joking and working through their problems long enough for a teacher to find them and shoo them to class.</p>\n<p>The next day, they work towards going to gym period. They do it again on the next day, and the day after that and the day after that. It\u2019s slow moving and more than a little frustrating some days, but they try and that\u2019s all Peter can as for. In turn, he tries, too. It takes a while\u2014some bribery and mandated therapy sessions too\u2014 but eventually most of the decathlon team is able to return to gym class.</p>\n<p>Some don\u2019t and that\u2019s okay. As Mr. Stark so kindly put it, just because they think they have a responsibility to be fine doesn\u2019t mean they are. That\u2019s okay<em>. </em>It\u2019s okay not to be okay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Betty B </strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@BBrant \u00b7 1h </span></p>\n<p>spiderman does not have a twitter which is unfortunate because sometimes the things he says are hilarious</p>\n<p><strong>spooderman</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\"> @smfan \u00b7 30m </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to </span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@BBrant</span></p>\n<p>You know him?</p>\n<p><strong>Betty B</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@BBrant \u00b7 4m</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to</span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@smfan @BBrant</span></p>\n<p>buddy im from queens. everyone and their cat has heard him chatting while swinging through the city</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[sally]: should we let the avengers fanclub know we know the avengers</p>\n<p>[ned]: yes</p>\n<p>[cindy]: please do it</p>\n<p>[peter]: no</p>\n<p>[michelle]: absolutely not</p>\n<p>[sally]: oh my god please let me just release one picture of hawkeye anonymously to the fan club. please</p>\n<p>[michelle]: absolutely. not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They win the decathlon competition, but it\u2019s a near thing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Ned who scores the winning point. Afterwards, his face is flushes as he\u2019s mobbed by the entire team with their congratulations. Parents politely clap from their seats. Peter can make out the vague outline of a group of <em>inconspicuous</em>\u2014that\u2019s sarcasm, by the way because baseball caps and t-shirts are not an appropriate disguise when sneaking into high school decathlon meets\u2014of the Avengers in the very back of the competition area.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time Peter has been near Flash since, well, <em>everything</em>. Despite no longer being an alternate, Flash doesn\u2019t look at him once\u2014just like during the practices that he actually showed up at\u2014for the duration of the event. He answers what he has to, smiles when they win and disappears into the crowd before Peter can say anything.</p>\n<p>Things with Flash have been rocky, at best. Flash, for his part, hasn\u2019t said anything about Spider-Man. In fact, Flash hasn\u2019t said anything at <em>all. </em></p>\n<p>However, Peter notices a lot more than people give him credit for. He didn\u2019t used to, but being a teenage vigilante kinda helps in the whole <em>pay attention </em>skillset. Helps not getting shot and all. So it\u2019s really not hard to notice the general avoidance, the lack of harsh words, the lack of vindictive looks. No one has bothered Peter about his Stark Internship anymore. Flash stops hanging out with\u00a0some of his other friends, too.</p>\n<p>As much as Peter appreciates the lack of being an asshole, Peter\u2019s pretty worried about Flash.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t focus on that now, however. His team\u2019s happiness is contagious. Peter finds himself wrapped up in the celebration, dragged from the stage. Their trophy is held high in the air as everyone croons about their victory.</p>\n<p>Everyone splits off to find their parents in the aftermath of the competition. It\u2019s rowdy and loud, but Peter shakes them off eventually, gets a hug and a congratulations from his Aunt, and makes his way over to the Avengers is disguise.</p>\n<p>Vision, Sam, Thor and Rhodey, predictably, aren\u2019t here, but that\u2019s okay because just about everyone else is. Mr. Stark is smiling at him with something that Peter hopes is pride, Mr. Rogers and Clint pat him on the shoulder, Wanda pulls him into a hug. Bruce and Natasha don\u2019t say anything, but the expressions on their faces make Peter\u2019s heart swell.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s glad they came. It means more than they\u2019ll probably ever know.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations on your win,\u201d Wanda says. \u201cIt looks like fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us next time we practice,\u201d Peter says and means it. He knows that Wanda doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable\u2014after all, his team reminds her too much of her late brother\u2014but she\u2019s been trying more than anyone and if Peter can ease that pain, just by a little, he would do anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I will take you up on that, in the future,\u201d Wanda says, tone light. Peter beams at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys really didn\u2019t have to come. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate you guys come out here\u2014\u201d Peter rushes to explain. \u201cI do! I really do, but it\u2019s just some dumb decathlon competition. I\u2019m sure you had Avengers stuff to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to,\u201d Natasha assures. \u201cYou and your team don\u2019t get to spend hours on our couch and expect us not to be a little invested.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t notice when Ned sneaks up behind him until Ned brushes past him, looking like a kid in a candy store and rushes out, \u201c<em>Oh my god is that Black Widow</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha puts a finger to her lips, smile on her face, and Ned shuts his mouth for all of five seconds. Then, in a whisper, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Ms. Black Widow ma\u2019am, it\u2019s such an honor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wants to mention that Ned sees them every other week and has, in fact, met her before. He doesn\u2019t, though, content to let Natasha and the others handle it while Ned flips out about the <em>Avengers\u00a0</em>showing up at their <em>decathlon meet</em>, because, <em>really Peter, how cool is that</em>?!</p>\n<p>Sally spots them and meanders over to the group. Her face lights up in recognition. \u201cYou guys came!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like we\u2019d miss it?\u201d Mr. Stark says. Both Sally and Ned\u2019s faces brighten that much more and Peter fights to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Mr. Rogers tells them.</p>\n<p>The rest of his team seems to take notice because most seem to shake their parents and slowly make their way over. Almost all of them recognize the group immediately considering the amount of times an Avenger has crashed a decathlon practice. A few of the braver members of his team, Charles and Betty, strike up a conversation with one of the various Avengers. It doesn\u2019t take long for the rest of the team, too, to join in. They\u2019re laughing and joking and excited. Even Mr. Harrington comes up and thanks the Avengers for coming because <em>it really means a lot of the kids, you see, so we very much appreciate your continued support</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>The joy from the rest of his team makes Flash that much more noticeable.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on the steps of the stage, far away from the crowd and mostly in the shadows. His shoulders are hunched, hands twisting in his lap. His back is turned. He\u2019s on his phone but not really looking at it. Every once in a while, he\u2019ll scan the room like he\u2019s waiting for someone to show up.</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates for just the tiniest second.</p>\n<p>In the past, Peter had always hesitated because Flash had always been with others. Another jerk, a teacher, or anyone really. Peter hesitates now, not because Flash has someone by his side, but because Flash is utterly alone. His parents are nowhere to be seen and Peter, with a twisted feeling in his gut, understands why.</p>\n<p>No one showed up for him.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t have a mom and dad. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had his mom and dad; the plane crash took them away long before Peter ever really knew them. He understands that feeling of loneliness when people run and hug their mom and dad, but Peter still has <em>parents</em>. His uncle and aunt had loved and cared for him like he was their own. Even with Uncle Ben gone, his aunt is more of a mom to him than he remembers his birth mother to be. That\u2019s not her fault, really\u2014Peter was too young to remember and too young to form a connection.</p>\n<p>Peter makes his way over to Flash</p>\n<p>He has his aunt and he has the Avengers. Flash has no one, because no one showed up. No one ever shows up.</p>\n<p>Flash sees him, sighs, and hunches over just a bit more. He doesn\u2019t run away, though, so Peter takes that as an invitation. He takes a seat next to him on the stairs leading up to the stage, silent, and waits for Flash to speak first.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave, right?\u201d Flash eventually asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot unless you want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash eyes him for a second, then goes back to his phone. It\u2019s an avoidance behavior\u2014Cindy does the same thing when there\u2019s a lot on her mind and not enough words to say exactly what it is. Peter doesn\u2019t push, leans back against the stairs, and waits. Not a single person takes notice of the two teenagers, hidden away mostly by the shadows of the competition area.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should expect it by now,\u201d Flash says slowly and a little unsure. He gestures to the empty space around them before shoving his hands in the pockets of his letter jacket. \u201cMy parents. They\u2019ve never shown up before. It\u2019s just some stupid competition. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Flash huffs out a sigh. \u201cWhy are you here, Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut you kind of look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this some superhero requirement? Trying to cheer up people when they\u2019re being pathetic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being pathetic, Flash,\u201d Peter says immediately. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never read the superhero manual.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash blinks at him before shaking his head and muttering under his breath, almost quiet enough that Peter doesn\u2019t hear, \u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019s a superhero manual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not. That was a joke,\u201d Peter says. Flash stays quiet. Should he...? Screw it. \u201cYou want to come to the compound with me tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash stares at him for a hot minute. Peter almost starts squirming. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said anything.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Why would you offer that?\u201d Flash asks eventually.</p>\n<p>Peter bites his lip. \u201cSince you\u2019re not an alternate anymore, I dunno, I figured we could practice together? If you wanted, of course. That way you can show your parents up when we win nationals and you answer the winning question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yep. Peter is definitely nervous. Flash isn\u2019t really giving him any emotional cues to go by and Peter doesn\u2019t know Flash well enough to know when to back off and leave him alone. It comes with the whole <em>being a jackass for literal years and changing your entire personally in five weeks after a really traumatic situation </em>kinda thing. \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Flash hesitates before shaking his head. \u201cI mean, I just don\u2019t understand why me? I was\u2014I was awful to you. I said a lot of shit, did a lot of shit and you <em>still</em> saved my life, man. I don't even know why you're talking to me right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re working on getting better,\u201d Flash gives him a look and Peter hides his smile. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed. You told everyone else to back off of me. You haven\u2019t thrown spitballs at all in calculus. Haven\u2019t said anything awful since the gym. You even let me borrow a pencil last period.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not being awful to you because I found out <em>you </em>are\u00a0<em>Spider-Man</em>,\u201d Flash snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being awful to me because you realized you were wrong,\u201d Peter corrects. \u201cI don\u2019t care how that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d Flash parrots his own words right back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen make it better,\u201d Peter says and stands up. He offers out his hand to pull Flash up, or rather, as a truce. \u201cSo, compound?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a second of hesitation, but there's a tiny smile on Flash's hand when\u00a0he takes it. \u201cSure, Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Flash shows up for his first Avengers compound team meeting the very next weekend.</p>\n<p>Charles says, particularly vindictive, \u201cOh? Do my eyes deceive me or is Flash Thompson actually at an Avengers practice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash tells him to shut up. Everyone laughs.</p>\n<p>MJ shuffles the decathlon cards and picks out the ones hastily added with Avengers trivia on them. Peter calls the entire team\u2019s attention lest a playful fight breaks out. They stare up at him and he starts the meeting with, \u201cCan we please stop spreading wildly inaccurate things about Spider-Man on twitter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is shut down immediately.</p>\n<p>Everything else settles in, comfortably, from there.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Flash</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\"> @f.thompson \u00b7 1d</span></p>\n<p>im not saying spider-man is actually a spider in real life. im just saying no one can prove that he isn\u2019t</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[flash]: hey guys</p>\n<p>[sally]: holy shit flash speaks</p>\n<p>[charles]: welcome to hell population nine and a half :)</p>\n<p>[flash]: whos the half</p>\n<p>[charles]: mr harrington when i send him screenshots of our texts</p>\n<p>[betty]: godspeed mr harrington</p>\n<p>[flash]: anyways, sorry about everything i was just. yeah.</p>\n<p>[peter]: but its cool now</p>\n<p>[flash]: yeah</p>\n<p>[flash]: which is great and all because i have so many spider-man memes saved</p>\n<p>[cindy]: why is flash the only one who uses a hyphen</p>\n<p>[peter]: its called respect</p>\n<p>[cindy]: ive never respected u less in my life</p>\n<p>[peter]: unfriended. blocked. \u00a0</p>\n<p>[abe]: ok are we gonna ignore the fact that flash had a buttfuck of spiderman memes saved and hes not sharing them, right now,</p>\n<p>[michelle]: yes</p>\n<p>[peter]: yes</p>\n<p>[ned]: no</p>\n<p>[abe]: welcome to the gc</p>\n<p>[abe]: send in the memes</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ned shows him the tweet the next day. Flash, who\u2019s account had previously been inactive for close to a month, has a shiny new post right at the top of the page and several new messages in the group chat.</p>\n<p>Peter reads them, stares for second before he laughs and laughs and thinks, just maybe, this isn\u2019t so bad after all.</p>\n<p><strong>ally sally</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@sally.av \u00b7 6m</span></p>\n<p>y\u2019all ever just think of your impending doom and how you might die isnt actually how you think you\u2019re going to die</p>\n<p><strong>Betty B</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@BBrant \u00b7 2m</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to</span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@sally.av</span></p>\n<p>bad night?</p>\n<p><strong>ally sally</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@sally.av \u00b7 30s</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to</span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@sally.av @BBrant</span></p>\n<p>bad night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s in fourth period calculus doing the assigned busywork when he hears the news.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, it\u2019s not Peter than realizes what\u2019s going on at first.</p>\n<p>In fact, that class is abuzz with quiet chatter long before Peter even looks up from his worksheet. It takes Sally saying in a low voice, \u201cHey, this looks kinda bad,\u201d and discreetly shoving her phone in his hands for him the read the livestream headline of <em>BREAKING NEWS: NEW YORK ATTACKED\u00a0</em>before he even catches on.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Peter says as he watches Iron Man get blasted into a building through the livestream.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man\u2019s not there yet,\u201d Sally says, voice low. She takes her phone back right as Peter starts wracking his brain for ways to get out of calculus without his teacher giving him a detention. \u201cYou think he\u2019s going to show up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s already packing his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man always shows up,\u201d Peter tells her before raising his hand. When his teacher calls on him, Peter rushes out, \u201cMs. Vern, I just remembered that we have a problem with decathlon and Mr. Harrington needs my assistance like <em>right now</em>, can I please leave early if I turn in my sheet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash, MJ and Sally\u2014the only other people in this class who have a vague idea of what\u2019s going on\u2014watch him like a hawk.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vern frowns at him. \u201cLet me verify this with Mr. Harrington first.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s cool and all, but Peter does not have time for Mr. Harrington to make up a bullshit excuse. Giant monsters attacking New York and all make for a rather large emergency so Peter feels it\u2019s pretty justified when he says, \u201cNo time! I gotta go,\u201d and goes tearing out the door before Ms. Vern can catch him.</p>\n<p>Behind him, he hears his teacher calling his name and the muffled gossip of the class. He\u2019s almost out of hearing range when he hears, \u201cMs. Jones, Ms. Avril, please go get Mr. Parker and tell him we need to discuss this before he up and leaves again.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s super neat and all but Peter doesn\u2019t have time to wait up for them. He rushes inside the nearest bathroom, checking to make sure there\u2019s no one there, before he starts yanking off his clothes. He doesn\u2019t bother with a stall, too much in a hurry to really care.</p>\n<p>That proves to be a mistake as Peter is caught, half way in his spider-suit when Mr. Harrington walks through the door.</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him, eyes wide. Mr. Harrington stares back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, there\u2019s an attack downtown and I..?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Mr. Harrington says with all the exasperation of teaching a high school vigilante and, in turn, breaking just about every single school rule there ever is. \u201cI\u2019ll cover for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell Ms. Warren I\u2019m sorry about missing her test next period and that I promise I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cI\u2019ll handle the academics. You go save the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs in relief, pulls the rest of the suit on and throws his backpack over his shoulder. This high school superhero thing is much easier when he has people that can actually help him. \u201cThank you, Mr. Harrington, sir. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would hope not considering New York rests on your shoulders, now,\u201d Mr. Harrington says and there\u2019s a smile on his face. He gestures for Peter to follow him. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here without being seen.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>So\u00a0</em>much easier.</p>\n<p>MJ and Sally are waiting outside the bathroom. Peter waves at them, mask on. MJ rolls her eyes but Sally waves back, looking at the suit in awe.</p>\n<p>It occurs to Peter that despite being aware of his secret identity, none of his team besides Ned has actually <em>seen\u00a0</em>him in the suit. Peter hopes, for the rest of them, the he keeps it that way. Being in the suit means danger and danger is the <em>last\u00a0</em>place he wants his team.</p>\n<p>The four of them start walking down the hall. Peter keeps a careful ear out for any other people, but fortunately class time means the halls are blissfully empty.</p>\n<p>Or, at least, they were. Peter has just enough time for his spidey-sense to ping when he hears two distinct pairs of footsteps. He doesn\u2019t have any time to react when Flash, with determination in his step, rounds the corner.</p>\n<p>Flash stops and his eyes widen when he sees Peter, full suit on, sanding in the middle of an empty hallway with only Mr. Harrington, Sally and MJ as backup. For a second, no one says anything but then Flash rushes forward like a man on a mission. He grabs Peter\u2019s arm and promptly shoves him in the nearest storage closet. He even slams the door shut and everything.</p>\n<p>Peter is more than a little stunned. He\u2019s left in near darkness except for the small grate at eye-level that he can kinda see out of if he squints.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh, Flash?\u201d Peter says and knocks on the door. \u201cNot to assume but I thought we were past this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash shushes him and leans against the door. Peter doesn\u2019t know whether to be offended or worried.</p>\n<p>Luckily, it\u2019s neither because Ms. Warren takes that second to round the corner as well. She spots Mr. Harrington, MJ, Sally and Flash and walks towards them. Peter peaks through the grate of the door, almost not daring the breathe and thanks every deity possible that his decathlon team members actually do care about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave any of you seen Peter?\u201d Ms. Warren asks. \u201cMs. Vern just messaged me about him suddenly leaving class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sally flounders, \u201cPeter\u2019s uh\u2014he\u2019s uh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something,\u201d Flash blurts out. Ms. Warren stares at him.</p>\n<p>Sally grabs his arm and yanks him away. She hisses, low enough for Ms. Warren not to hear, \u201c<em>Really</em>? \u2018He\u2019s taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something\u2019? <em>That\u2019s\u00a0</em>what you come up with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Sally?\u201d Flash hisses right back. \u201cYou want me to tell everyone that Peter Parker is Spider-Man instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ stares at Mr. Harrington with the looks of someone who has seen something worse than death.</p>\n<p>Mr. Harrington clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cI just sent Peter to get me some supplies. He should be back soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Ms. Warren takes the excuse. \u201cPrincipal Morita is shutting down the school soon due to the villain attack in Manhattan. I want to make sure that all students are accounted for before that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Harrington nods like he hasn\u2019t just been helping Peter sneak out. \u201cOf course. I was just about to send Michelle to find him,\u201d Mr. Harrington sends her a pointed look. She looks at him, shrugs and wanders down the walls, dragging Sally and Flash along behind her. Mr. Harrington meets Ms. Warren\u2019s eyes and lies through his teeth, \u201cI\u2019ll personally make sure they find him and get him safely to class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Warren thanks him and continues down the hall. Peter has never been more thankful to Mr. Harrington in his life.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s long after the battle ends that Peter does, eventually, get back to class. That class is first period the next day. None of his teachers seemed to notice his mysterious absence yesterday and if he\u2019s a little extra tired in decathlon, no one says anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Cindy</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@MoonC \u00b7 38m</span></p>\n<p>i feel like, hypothetically, if spiderman was a real person, he\u2019d be a pretty stand up dude but also a walking disaster</p>\n<p><strong>jess</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@spidermanstan345 \u00b7 2m</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to</span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@MoonC</span></p>\n<p>what the fuck do you mean IF hes a real person</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[betty]: WE\u2019RE BIG TIME NOW BOYS</p>\n<p>[betty]: GUYS</p>\n<p>[betty]: GUYS PLEAS E RESPOND</p>\n<p>[charles]: oh my god WHAT do you want we have CLASS</p>\n<p>[betty]: <span class=\"twitterblue\">https://www.youtube.com/watch/buzzedfeedunsolved-the-mysterious-spider-man</span></p>\n<p>[flash]: no fucking way</p>\n<p>[sally]: we stan a legend</p>\n<p>[betty]: YES WAY</p>\n<p>[flash]: is it just me or did ryan heavily imply that spiderman is an alien</p>\n<p>[abe]: ned just showed peter and he slammed his face on his desk like a loser</p>\n<p>[sally]: u would think he\u2019d be more excited</p>\n<p>[abe]: peters face when ryan says we cant prove he has eight arms under his spandex is honestly the only entertainment i ever want</p>\n<p>[flash]: pics or it didn\u2019t happen</p>\n<p>[abe]: [peterdying.png]</p>\n<p>[cindy]: same peter</p>\n<p>[cindy]: same</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how or why, but he finds more and more of his team starting to look out for him. By look out for him, he means stalk him from the moment he leaves the school grounds up until he makes it to the bus station or a nearby alley, change into his Spider-Man gear, and swing off.</p>\n<p>His spidey-sense never once goes off so, yeah, maybe he assumes that they\u2019re curious about the Spider-Man stuff. After all, he takes a large amount of care to make sure that none of them are near Spider-Man when Spider-Man is doing crime fighting things. The gym and bus had been bad enough\u2014there\u2019s absolutely no reason for them to follow him around back alleys and potentially get hurt.</p>\n<p>If they\u2019re going to keep following him, he\u2019s going to put a stop to it. If they really wanted to see Spider-Man, then he\u2019ll show them Spider-Man but without all the guns and stabbings and such.</p>\n<p>He corners them, as always, in decathlon practice. It\u2019s an Avengers weekend, so they\u2019re curled up on the comforting couches of the common room.</p>\n<p>Peter specifically waits until Mr. Stark, Clint and Mr. Harrington leave the room before he blurts out, \u201cIf you guys wanted to see Spider-Man all you had to do is ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alright. Not the best way to phrase that. They stare at him like he\u2019s grown a second head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe watch Spider-Man on twitter every night, dude,\u201d Charles says which makes no sense because if they watch him on twitter then <em>why </em>are they following him? \u201cNed\u2019s got the uh, what\u2019s it called?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider tracker,\u201d Ned says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s got the spider tracker and sends us updates if anything bad happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is going to chose to ignore that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you following me?\u201d Peter asks. It gets a rather immediate reaction if the mumbled arguing is anything to go by. At least they have the decency to look a little guilty.</p>\n<p>Abe bites his lip. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him. Then he points to his chest where his Spider-Man logo would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cFreaky spider powers,\u201d Abe says. \u201cNoted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were walking you to where ever you needed to go,\u201d Sally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u00a0<em>why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Cindy, who finally gives him an answer. \u201cNo offence, Peter, but you\u2019re a danger magnet to the extreme\u2014no, shut up, you definitely are\u2014so we figured, the least we can do is make sure you get into your suit or go home without being thrown into a wall by some weirdo. An extra set of eyes kinda. I doubt we could do anything if a real villain showed up, but we could at least give you a warning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is almost touched if it isn\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s Spider-Man, he can bench press a bus if push came to shove and could absolutely take being thrown into a wall. They also definitely know about his spidey-sense. Peter has told them about his spidey-sense before. Apparently, his spidey-sense does not matter in the face of a bunch of determined team members.</p>\n<p>Peter looks at everyone for support. He finds none. Ned won\u2019t even meet his eyes, the traitor. \u201cCome <em>on</em>. Even you, Flash?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can bench press a truck,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThat is literally something I can do. I can stick to walls. I have a danger sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u00a0</em>is exactly why we\u2019re doing this, you overconfident biddy,\u201d Cindy says and Peter has to object because he is neither a biddy nor overconfident and does, in fact, doubt his abilities at least once a day. \u201cPeter, you\u2019ve been doing this dangerous thing alone for so long. We just want to help you, even if that makes making sure you get home safe or get into your suit without being seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>It still doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re all starting to sound like his aunt and Mr. Stark. Peter doesn\u2019t press the issue any more.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sound from the doorway.</p>\n<p>Clint leads into view with a vindictive smile on his face. Peter hides his face in his hands and wishes the ground would swallow him whole.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Pete, they\u2019re worried about you,\u201d Clint coos. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious. I love all of you kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grabs the nearest thing he can\u2014a book\u2014and chucks it at him. Clint leaves, laughing all the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>arachnid decathlon </strong>\n</p>\n<p>[charles]: alright so did anyone see the spiderman shit this morning</p>\n<p>[flash]: yeah</p>\n<p>[cindy]: is peter alive??</p>\n<p>[charles]: idk he hasn\u2019t posted anything but also u know him</p>\n<p>[betty]: peter?</p>\n<p>[abe]: hello? peter?</p>\n<p>[cindy]: hewwwo!!! pweter!!!</p>\n<p>[peter]: if u make me read that one more time i actually will die</p>\n<p>[abe]: he lives</p>\n<p>[peter]: its 6:30 i have 30 more minutes before i have to get up guys please let me sleep</p>\n<p>[charles]: SORRY not all of us can SWING to SCHOOL when we are LATE</p>\n<p>[charles]: some us have to BIKE our dumb asses ALL THE WAY to midtown</p>\n<p>[sally]: what do u do when it snows</p>\n<p>[charles]: big tires</p>\n<p>[sally]: spiderman who? i only know big tire charles</p>\n<p>[flash]: *spider-man</p>\n<p>[sally]: shut</p>\n<p>[ned]: fr fr peter u ok? last night looked bad man</p>\n<p>[peter]: its fine i was only stabbed like, once,</p>\n<p>[abe]: congratulations that\u2019s almost an improvement</p>\n<p>[flash]: is he serious? i cant tell if hes serious</p>\n<p>[cindy]: peter if u come to school with a stab wound im going to stab you myself</p>\n<p>[michelle]: hey everyone reminder that we have decathlon this afternoon and if you miss it im hunting you down for sport</p>\n<p>[ned]: mj peter may or may not have gotten stabbed</p>\n<p>[michelle]: and?</p>\n<p>[charles]: savage</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the thing is, Peter does, in fact, have a stab wound.</p>\n<p>He hides it pretty well from most everyone but he can feel Ned\u2019s judging stare when he winces sitting down at lunch. Flash passes him a note in calc that\u2019s a poorly drawn spider and <em>are you ok? </em>written underneath. The rest of his team definitely knows someone is up and Peter dreads decathlon that afternoon more than anything. His team is very observant. Unfortunately, they also very much like the worry.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s why he\u2019s not surprised that the moment he walks in the library, he\u2019s immediately crowded by just about everyone. They take exactly one look at his poorly veiled attempt to hide that he did, in fact, get stabbed last night and sit him down in the hard library chairs. Peter hides his wince.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Charles says. His voice is more than a little shocked. \u201cAre you <em>seriously\u00a0</em>doing decathlon with a stab wound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMJ would kill me if I skipped,\u201d Peter says as an excuse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would,\u201d MJ nods but its hard not to hear to slight tinge of worry in her words.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not very convincing seeing the looks he\u2019s still getting. Peter huffs out a sigh and ignores the twinge of pain. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s at exactly that point that everyone pauses. They start exchanging little worried glances over his head as if he can\u2019t see them. It\u2019s the same expression he\u2019s to given to other people when calming his team mates down from a panic attack.</p>\n<p><em>They\u2019re worried about him</em>, Peter realizes with a start. Who knew that eight weeks of putting up with vigilante bullshit would get other people worrying.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Abe says slowly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it any less terrifying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really fine,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta take care of yourself,\u201d Abe continues, like Peter never spoke. \u201cWe know the superhero stuff is huge but, man, you\u2019re going to get yourself killed. You\u2019re our friend and we don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stand around him, nodding. Peter squints. \u201cHave you guys been talking about this? Because it sounds like you\u2019ve been talking about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares at Ned specifically who sweats and squirms under his look. MJ flips him off. They have definitely been talking about him, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Sally says slowly. \u201cConsider this an intervention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are laying down ground rules,\u201d Cindy says. \u201cNumber one is that if you get in trouble and can\u2019t contact the Avengers or whoever, you call one of us. We aren\u2019t going to let you bleed out in an alley. Second rule is that if you feel like you need to leave, for whatever reason, tell us and we\u2019ll get you out. Third rule is stop shutting us out. It\u2019s not healthy. We understand this is dangerous business\u2014we were there, remember?\u2014but you\u2019ve helped all of us so much, Peter, we just want to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us help,\u201d Charles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re our friend,\u201d Flash says and cracks somewhat of a grin. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFourth rule is we get free Spider-Man merch for being awesome,\u201d Betty adds. The team nods at that. \u201cFifth rule is let us know if you ever need the, uh, the teenage mutant spider support group instead of the decathlon support group.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter would have been touched if they didn\u2019t call themselves the teenage mutant spider support group.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sweats for all of ten seconds before giving in. \u201cOkay, okay. I agree,\u201d they give him separate, teasing grins. Peter rolls his eyes but can\u2019t keep the smile off his face. \u201cThank you all for the mushy feelings and letting me know you guys care but don\u2019t we have decathlon to get to?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s MJ that surprises him the most. She passes him the cards (having, again, picked out the Avengers themed ones) and says, \u201cTell us if you need a break, okay?\u201d Upon seeing his look of surprise, she rolls her eyes and lightly punches him in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not heartless, Peter. Even though you shouldn't\u00a0have gotten stabbed in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter did not want to get stabbed in the first place. He does not tell her this.</p>\n<p>Still, it surprises him. He tries not to think of the warmth in his chest because he guesses that, yeah, the caring thing is actually kind of nice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>michelle</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@mj.jones\u00a0\u00b7 38m</span></p>\n<p>spiderman absolutely knows what a furry is and constantly is reminded of the fact that his identity is, in fact, his fursona. in this essay i will</p>\n<p><strong>Cindy</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@MoonC \u00b7 7m</span></p>\n<p> <span class=\"twittergrey\">Replying to</span> <span class=\"twitterblue\">@mj.jones</span></p>\n<p>wheres the essay mj</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eight weeks since the incident turns into nine, nine turns into ten. Ten turns into three months, then four, then six. Time continues.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s new normal is pretty weird. His teams\u2014both teams, because apparently his decathlon team is firmly planting themselves into superhuman society and nothing is stopping them\u2014still worry.</p>\n<p>The decathlon practices every other weekend at the Avengers compound turn into once a week practices with cards, baking, board games and laughter to the point where it\u2019s not so much as a practice and more of a weekly get together.</p>\n<p>They watch Buzzfeed: Unsolved on the couch enough times that they gather some rouge Avengers who, in turn, try and guess which episodes are because of HYDRA, because of Bucky, or because of SHIELD.</p>\n<p>Life goes on.</p>\n<p>They work on their problems and trauma together (therapy doesn\u2019t hurt, either) to the point where things almost seem like they were before. They aren\u2019t, of course, and sometimes bad days happen but they work on those together, as a team.</p>\n<p>Peter still has pretense to cover, especially in gym. It doesn\u2019t stop the smug looks from his team mates whenever he has to bluff his way out of an exercise. The <em>I\u2019m lapping Spider-Man\u00a0</em>from Flash <em>every single time\u00a0</em>he\u2019s passed in a lap is pretty common too.</p>\n<p>Sally lounges around the Avengers compound and gripes about how she is living an instagram influencer\u2019s kinda lifestyle and she can\u2019t even tell anyone about it. Instead, they make due posting consistently outrageous rumors about Spider-Man on twitter. There are at least two separate tweets that have gotten more likes than Peter ever wanted. Cindy is particularly vicious about it, if the tweets Ned has shown him are anything to go by.</p>\n<p>Decathlon practice comes and goes. Mr. Harrington is always reminding them not to use the bell for nefarious purposes. The team still shoves Avengers related trivia in the card deck every single week and every single week MJ goes through and throws those cards out. Abe, so far, is the only one who\u2019s managed to sneak a question by her. The question: what would Black Widow want for her birthday? The answer: no one actually knows. They get her chocolates anyways and she shows up at their practice and teaches them all hand-to-hand self-defense as a thank you.</p>\n<p>The team wins more decathlon competitions; enough so that they make it to Nationals for the second year in a row. This time it is, thankfully, not held in Washington D.C. Just to be safe, they avoid any and all elevators in tall buildings.</p>\n<p>Nationals goes just as well as last year except it\u2019s not MJ that scores the winning point\u2014it\u2019s Flash.</p>\n<p>(His parents never end up showing but, really, it\u2019s alright because he has his team to celebrate with instead.)</p>\n<p>It took less than a few months for his entire world to be turned on its axis but his skeleton is out of the closet, his team only continues to stronger as family, and it feels pretty damn <em>good</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Abe</strong> <span class=\"twittergrey\">@BBAbe \u00b7 1h</span></p>\n<p>maybe spidermans real power is the friends he makes along the way</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
