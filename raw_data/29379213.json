  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">Everything started with an email.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The email wasn\u2019t Izuku\u2019s. He shouldn\u2019t have even known the email existed, much less read the message so many times that he could recite the contents backwards. He didn\u2019t even know why he\u2019d picked up the printed email in the first place. (That was a lie. Izuku had picked it up partly because his Mom had taught littering was bad, partly because it was on the ground by a hero fight, and mostly because he\u2019d seen a hero agency insignia on the paper.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The email was clearly important and full of confidential information. Izuku might have even felt guilty about reading it (probably not enough to stop), except the information was now virtually irrelevant.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Windmeister, a new and flashy villain who controlled devastating winds, had been captured right in front of Izuku\u2019s eyes that morning. The email, folded twice and stained with dirt in the form of several shoe prints, was a now outdated plan on how to complete that capture. Well, not a full plan, more the seeds of a full plan. Lists of likely characteristics of Windmeister\u2019s quirk. Explanations of the sounds she made and conjecture on how those sounds controlled her winds. Ideas on how to disrupt both sounds and winds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In short, the email contained research. Analysis. Investigation and reasoning just like in Izuku\u2019s Analysis Notebooks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here was someone, presumably an adult, doing what Izuku was already doing and getting paid. Here was someone, presumably a professional, doing what Izuku was already doing and getting recognized. Here was someone, presumably hero-adjacent, doing what Izuku was already doing and <em>helping other people. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And, as far as he could tell, at the same skill level. (That was a lie. Izuku was better. Izuku had less resources, less training, less access, but he also had five more pages in his notebooks that talked about structural damage, Windmeister\u2019s clicking shoes, and weather correlations.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was intrigued.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had almost stopped his analysis. Why work on Hero Analysis for the Future when he couldn\u2019t be a hero? All Might wasn\u2019t wrong. His mom wasn\u2019t wrong. Being a hero was dangerous with a quirk, even more so without one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Regular</em> life without a quirk was dangerous, and he had plenty of support from online quirkless chats and message boards to back up that fact. It wasn\u2019t just Izuku. All quirkless people faced bullying and prejudice and discrimination for existing. Who was he to think that he could handle the danger of his own quirkless life (which he already couldn\u2019t, if the burns arcing up back had anything to suggest) with added regular villain encounters?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So he\u2019d gone back to school after his second run-in with the sludge-villain, after being told off by three separate Pro-heroes for saving Kacchan while they\u2019d stood and watched. It was a sudden decision, a sharp right turn on his path home, but Izuku had found himself standing over the school pond in dying orange light, holding his Notebook over the water with trembling hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If Kacchan was right and he\u2019d never be a hero, only a quirkless loser, then it seemed fitting that Kacchan be right about the fate of his Hero Analysis Notebook, too.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku dropped the Notebook, but not intentionally, because that would have been far to easy. The trembling in his hand had only gotten worse through two villain encounters and all that <em>fear</em>. A sudden sharp spasm of pain had his fingers clenching and releasing, spilling the Notebook to the dry ground a foot in front of the pond.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It fell open to All Might\u2019s signature, and Izuku stared a moment before looking away. His eyes caught, however on the page next to the name of his hero: a half-finished analysis of Mt. Lady, started before his day had really gone to shit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He crouched down, shaking hand extended to pick up the book, and ended up staring again, this time at his hand. There was blood under his nails, brackish and dark, from where he\u2019d scratched at the sludge-villain\u2019s arm or face. Bruises, soon to be thick and purple but currently faint and oddly patterned, were starting to creep over his knuckles and wrap around his wrist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And the smell. Now that he\u2019d noticed, the smell of sewer-dank-rot clung to his skin and worked into his lungs, stealing the air he\u2019d only just gotten back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By the time he went to bed that night the moon was starting to go down, his mom\u2019s light had long been off, and he had twelve pages of tight, cramped analysis on the sludge villain.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was breathing through ink scratched into damaged pages. The slight sweet scent of Kacchan\u2019s explosions and washed-out soot soothed the tremble in his hands with every sentence he wrote.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had written about why the villain needed a person, how he took over, what he could do once in a meat suit. Izuku theorized on methods of confirming if the villain had taken someone over, and how to expunge him from both a living and dead body. Izuku had thought about the consistency of the sludge, trying to pinpoint if it was more of a natural mud or simply a liquefaction of the villain\u2019s own body. Izuku considered why a bottle could hold the villain, and what other containers would work and be more effective.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku came up with plans and procedures of what he would do if he ran into the villain again, however unlikely that might be.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the morning, with Kacchan\u2019s frightened eyes winding though half-remembered dreams and purple bruises tracking up his arms, Izuku stared at his notebook: hero analysis before All Might\u2019s signature, a villain analysis after.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Izuku didn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He didn\u2019t stop his analysis at one villain. He didn\u2019t stop at analyzing their powers and skills. He didn\u2019t stop once he\u2019d found the perfect hero matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He stopped when he could think of no more ways for the villain to be defeated, handled, mitigated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All Might was right. His mom was right. Being a hero was dangerous, especially for a kid without a quirk. But Kacchan wasn\u2019t right. The kids at school weren\u2019t right.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wasn\u2019t <em>useless. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He didn\u2019t stop (not when the muttered words and the scratched pages were the only way he could remember to breathe).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku took a week off of analyzing villains after he found the email. One week to research the researchers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He found consultants. An entire profession of people paid to help heros help people by analyzing both villains and heroes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was fascinated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consultants were different from analysts in that they didn\u2019t work with an agency, but were instead contracted from outside. A lot of them even worked remotely, from a distance, and communicated mainly through email or other online forums.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which had potential.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The vetting process on consultants wasn\u2019t nearly as strict as it was for heroes. In fact, it barely existed. Many agencies had their own analysts, at least the larger ones did, so consultants got shuffled into an odd grey area.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Basically, if a hero or agency needed outside help, they were responsible for their own back-checking. Which was a sound enough policy, if only most agencies, particularly the smaller ones, weren\u2019t only using consultants because they were some combination of overworked, overwhelmed, and under-qualified.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had gone on a tangent, one only lasting about twenty hours (four of which were spent sleeping; his bruises were gone but still his hands trembled), and dove into the requirements for heroes. While most hero schools, UA at the forefront, prized analysis and taught a class or two about how to judge their opponents, that was the sum total. Again, the grey area seemed to declare that if a hero got their license, then they were competent enough to analyze their surroundings and foes and react accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which wasn\u2019t true. At all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had gone on another tangent, this one lasting about a week, and researched heroes. Not specific heroes, as had been his main habit before his descent into villain-analysis, but the industry as a whole. He\u2019d never thought overly much about the industry before, only glossed over those details when imaging himself joining their ranks while being far too focused on individual fights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He found that young heroes died rather frequently, according to multiple sets of statistics. They either died or they got help. Many worked with large name agencies, like the Endeavour Agency (Endeavour had a whole notebook to himself that was one of three that sat out of order in a locked drawer of Izuku\u2019s desk only marked with a mental note of \u2018later\u2019). These young heroes had resources and extra training and a variety of professionals right there to offer help whether they wanted it or not.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hero schools were surprisingly proactive for their graduates, often presenting a framework of resources young heroes could use until they got settled. It wasn\u2019t enough. The heroes who were good and not great, the heroes who didn\u2019t have flashy quirks, the heroes who had \u2018villainous\u2019 quirks had a much harder time getting settled safely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So they used outside help and information. They just didn\u2019t always have the time or resources to properly vet said information. While, the Hero Commission did certify several large consulting firms, these were large firms. Large firms were expensive and didn\u2019t always (ever) deal well with little guys or newcomers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which led to Independents. Independent consultants were what captivated Izuku. They were what he spent four days and nights delving deeply into, trying to understand. They were his best option.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because most independents consultants weren\u2019t retired heroes, most of them didn\u2019t have the backing of the Commission, and most of them had no stated qualifications.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What they had was a Name. A name and a reputation. Izuku could <em>make </em>those.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He started with Endeavour Agency. Well, not just Endeavour Agency, but several agencies that employed or were headed by top fifty heroes. He didn\u2019t succeed with them, and didn\u2019t really expect to, but he wanted to know how they\u2019d react. He wanted a baseline for the worst (ie. Endeavour Agency) as context to determine how successful the other responses actually were.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It had taken only two weeks to gather information and analyze a series of incidents or villains that Izuku knew were current. It wasn\u2019t like he had to start from scratch, he just had to pick out a few names from his most recent analysis notebook and dig into a few Newspaper articles or hero forums to figure out which heroes were the connected to the case.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or which heroes should be connected. The facts that Kamui Woods was looking into Firework while Endeavour was chasing Waterwhip was just outright baffling. While Izuku was a firm believer in planning and thinking beats all, any elementry-aged Pokemon player could explain the basic shortfalls of that particular lineup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Regardless, Izuku had five folders full of his best analysis. Three on specific villains, one on gang activity, and one on a car-repair shop he knew was a front.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He sent variations of each folder to twenty different agencies and heroes. That was what the second week of research had been for; to research the various different specialties and case loads. He didn\u2019t simply send the file, but bits of information that would be most useful. For example, Endevor\u2019s agency got a breakdown of Waterwhip\u2019s abilities and known associates, while Best Jeanist\u2019s agency got a breakdown of Waterwhip\u2019s targets mapped out over both time and space, since the villain was mainly targeting high end stores within Best Jeanist\u2019s patrol routes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku stared at his whiteboard, recently scavenged from a second hand store, and studied the replies he\u2019d gotten. There were ten. Ten replies out of twenty agencies was much better than he\u2019d been expecting.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With a still trembling hand, he smoothed out the last printed email and attached the response to his board with tape. He then took several moments to write on neon green sticky notes for the agencies that had ignored him entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The responses were colour-coded, instead of being grouped in categories like positive or negative. He\u2019d had this board arranged since even before he\u2019d sent out his first packet of information. He chosen twenty agencies, fourteen daylight, six underground, ten well-known, ten small-time or just starting out. Ten to higher agents or actual heroes, five to tip lines, and five to newbies or low-key analysts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This wasn\u2019t a blind draw. Izuku needed to know who was going to take him seriously.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The answer was that most didn\u2019t, which wasn\u2019t surprising since Izuku didn\u2019t have a reputation yet. He also hadn\u2019t been sure where to start building one. That was what the board was for and, honestly, the board made his next steps quite clear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Three were standard \u2018Thanks for the tip, civilian, we have it all under control\u2019 automatic responses, all from daylight agencies. Two were negative, coated in arrogance and disparaging the need for any help, also from daylight agencies. One was down-right rude, demanding Izuku\u2019s source and accusing him of being an accomplice, from, surprise, a daylight agency.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One was vitriolic. He could have technically included it in either the negative/arrogant category or the rude category, since it was both. But. Well. It was the only response not taped to his board. Izuku had read it carefully, highlighted several key phrases, then unlocked his drawer, removed Endeavour\u2019s notebook from atop Kacchan\u2019s, and placed both the notebook and the printed email in a new folder before returning it to the \u2018Later\u2019 drawer and tucking the key back around his neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The cheap metal felt hot against his collar bone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It took a special kind of agency to hire analysts with such cruelty in them. To encourage speaking to someone who\u2019d been offering help and advice, even if was unwanted, in such a fashion. Izuku hadn\u2019t been part of the workforce, but he\u2019d seen his mom struggling under an awful boss several years prior, and had enough memories of teachers looking past his literally bleeding skin to know that<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>work culture was crucial. And the culture at Endeavour\u2019s agency appeared to be coated in toxic smoke.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So that was ten absent responses, thirteen when including the useless auto-replies, and four overwhelmingly negative. Three were left, none from daylight heroics.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Three were <em>positive. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku grinned, more sharply than his classmates likely knew he could.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One had been from a young sidekick with a non-offensive quirk a few years out of school, new to the underground heroics. She\u2019d been tentative, but grateful.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One had been from a police detective who\u2019d been passed the information during a raid. He\u2019d been cautious but respectful, treating Izuku like a well-informed CI.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last had been the underground hero Eraserhead. He\u2019d been brusque, but <em>complimentary. </em>(Izuku had fanboyed for a least ten minutes. He may have also printed two of Eraserhead\u2019s response so he could fold the second up really small to stick in the lining of his wallet.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku couldn\u2019t stop (not when typed thanks and gruff acknowledgement wrapped around his wrists where bruises had been and held the trembling at bay).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everything escalated with a present. Well, several presents.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was smart, despite what his mediocre grades might say, and Deku was clever, according to what the underground seemed to say, but neither he nor his consultant persona knew how to hack. He\u2019d never learned, too busy studying heroes and villains, which made him an excellent analyst and a decent consultant, and this left him with his first problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Security.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It turns out, the underground <em>talked. </em>Several weeks after Izuku had first really started putting his work out there, and he was <em>known. </em>For all that daylight heroes had the attention of civilians, the underground heroes had a communication network that put gossiping housewives to shame.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bubble Girl, the young sidekick who\u2019d responded so happily to Izuku\u2019s first consult, had told her superiors, and then her next superiors when the first ones fired her (Izuku had immediately followed up with an expose on the sexual harassment tendencies of her first boss, helping to restore Bubble Girl\u2019s reputation and taking down Izuku\u2019s first corrupt hero).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Detective Tsukauchi, the police officer who\u2019d received Izuku\u2019s first consult by accident, set an alert for his entire station to bring tips from Deku to him. The Detective took each and every tip seriously after a simple takedown had gone belly up when a gang member managed to summon several rarely seen higher ups during what should have been a simple drug bust (higher up\u2019s that Izuku had linked to the gang and whose quirks he\u2019d analyzed from old videos of college kids showing off at a party).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead had told other underground heroes. Not many, but enough that Izuku had options to send his analysis. Enough that Izuku had both a name and a reputation as Deku.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Enough that the Underground was curious.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had been cautious sending out information, using a new account he only ever accessed at the library and only ever during peak hours. And he really wasn\u2019t worried about being found out at the library. His mom was a librarian, and he\u2019d joined her there after school ever since he was four and learned that being quirkless meant he didn\u2019t get to have friends. The library knew him and would protect him as such.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The internet had no such loyalty. Hacking was on Izuku\u2019s To Do List, it was. He was just so busy now, with school and consulting on the regular. Besides, he was helping people. Helping <em>heroes. </em>His analysis had to be perfect.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So that was problem one. The fact that Izuku now had several very smart, very information-inspired people interested in him and no way to really protect himself or his online presence. So far, he imagined the fact that they were far busier than a middle school student, secret part-time work included, was his only real salvation. Also that he wasn\u2019t a criminal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His solution to the first problem didn\u2019t lead to the presents, not exactly. Rather, that solution just involved three weeks of intense work, computer-mapping software that didn\u2019t involve hacking, and a second whiteboard laid out with the key patrol routes, territories, and locations annotated with both police and hero schedules (there was a lot available publicly, and a lot more available to those who watched). And a pack of 100 office envelopes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was a student. He was easily overlooked even without the years of making himself as small and unnoticeable as possible. It was very very simple to leave envelopes at various dead-drops around town without being found.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The biggest downside was the lack of response, since he didn\u2019t go back to see if anything had been left in return, and he constantly changed locations. Izuku lived for the quickly delivered praise Deku\u2019s analysis gained. (These heroes and police had no idea how their throwaway thanks or haphazard compliments wove about him, keeping the dank scent of rot and sewer from creeping around his mind on bad days.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lack of praise wasn\u2019t really a problem, though, but rather something much more like Izuku\u2019s natural state of affairs. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to change his habits just to get more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not when he was helping people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The second problem, the one that did lead to the presents, was the line between consultant and vigilante. It wasn\u2019t a line Izuku had any intention of crossing (All Might was right, he had no quirk, getting directly involved was dangerous). Izuku wouldn\u2019t put that kind of worry or risk on his mom. He\u2019d never been able to put her in that kind of position, not even when he didn\u2019t have the breath-stability-net that was consulting and his desk was all but buried in spider lilies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But, staring down at his yellow backpack clutched in white-knuckled fingers, he wondered if he knew exactly where that line was.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIzuku, baby, I\u2019ve finished locking up. Time to head home.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku didn\u2019t look up. Couldn\u2019t look up from the scorched fabric that was hiding a Glock that had killed three in a local jewellery store robbery yesterday morning.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cZuku?\u201d He heard his mom\u2019s soft footsteps as she came in from the doorway and made her way into the ring of chairs. Hard plastic dug into his back when Izuku finally looked up, prompted by his mom\u2019s soft fingers slipping under his chin and scraping up through his hair. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? Hard night with the Group?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She wasn\u2019t wrong, exactly. He opened his mouth to agree, to blame it on the Group knowing she would never pry beyond that statement, but closed it as the scent of her lavender hand cream filled his nose, blocking the hints of dank-mildew and sewer-rot that had been seeping from his circling brain.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI accidentally created a private information network out of your patrons and the community that\u2019s two parts spy work, one part clean-up crew, and one part delivery service.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inko\u2019s hand stilled, momentarily. \u201cHow accidental?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And doesn\u2019t his mother know the tough questions. \u201cAbout forty percent? Becoming a hero consultant was intentional. As was passing information to heroes and the police and asking the Group if they had things to pass on and using various events to find more information for my analysis. The delivery part was completely unexpected.\u201d He tightened his hands on the backpack\u2019s straps.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cA consultant.\u201d Inko sat heavily on the plastic chair next to Izuku\u2019s, feet pointed in the empty center in the circle of chairs. She was silent a moment and Izuku could feel the weight of her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He whipped his head up to meet watering green eyes. \u201cMom?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re helping people, like you wanted. You found a way to work on your dream while keeping yourself <em>safe for me</em>. You\u2019re helping people, you\u2019re helping heroes, and now you\u2019d best start from the beginning so I can best figure out how to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku did. But only after they\u2019d both stopped crying (until he cried the last of the dark-dank-mildew from his lungs).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku\u2019s mother had been the one to teach him how to research.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inko had worked at Musutafu Public Library since Izuku was two. He\u2019d grown up under the watchful eye of bookshelves and computer banks. There he\u2019d learned how much information was readily available, if only one looked.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She\u2019d taught him to navigate Government databases, despite their poor designs and clunky features. She\u2019d taught him how to read hero Commission reports, and then to find the raw data beneath those reports. She\u2019d taught him to never undervalue the hard to hack print resources, particularly city records and archives. She\u2019d taught him the value of business reports, even though that took long evenings going over terminology. She\u2019d even been the one to bring his attention to blogs, message boards, fansites, and social media, for all that Izuku had really explored those on his own.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Midoryia Inko was, in no way, surprised by her son\u2019s ability to find and analyze information.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not when she\u2019d seen him pour these skills day after day into the library computers, ducking his head and hiding on third floor by the large windows to write up his notes in one of his ever-present notebooks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The small army of spies was only a little more surprising.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Musutafu Public Library was at an intersection of affluence, meaning that it had quite a few patrons who were decently well off, but was also very convenient for those of a lower economic status as well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A lot of the programs that the library ran were aimed towards helping people gain a foot up in the world. The library lent out meeting space and rooms to all sorts of support groups, such as those for alcohol or drug dependency and abuse recovery. They also ran financial information meetings, had lawyers in to speak, and partnered with child care facilities and shelters in the area.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku loved that side of his mother\u2019s work, and would often join her on library outreach programs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He loved it because he was helping people, regardless of his lack of quirk. But he also loved it because there was a distinct community of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u2019</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you can barely pay the rent for the next month or are struggling to get enough food on your child\u2019s plate, you often don\u2019t have time to worry about kicking someone else who was down.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By no means did this make everyone <em>friendly.</em> Izuku had seen his fair share of domestic disputes, drug deals, and hate attacks, both in the library and in the streets. Bullies were everywhere, particularly when you were quirkless in the rough part of town. If you avoided the assholes and the known troublemakers, however, there was a certain sense of solidarity: a mutual acknowledgement of possessing the shorter sticks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This was especially true for Inko\u2019s quiet, quirkless son.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inko was well known for her kind smiles, her helpful nature, and her shadow of a child. Her child who talked a lot, had tons of questions, and wanted to know everything. He also didn\u2019t go away, not really. He\u2019d leave if someone was getting angry, flinching harshly enough to make some people pause, and disappear only to be found talking to his mother an hour or two later, surfacing from some secluded corner.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He always come back, though. Over years at the library, years at the soup kitchen down the street, years running errands for the staff and various shop keepers, people knew him. And they trusted him, to a point. They knew if he asked a question it was because he wanted an answer, not to use against someone, but to keep and think and learn.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So no, Izuku hadn\u2019t really planned to start an information network of his own, but his natural curiosity and kindness had done that for him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The\u2026 deliberateness of the spy and delivery sides of things were both much more intentional and much more blindsiding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was quirkless. This was highly relevant to his network, even beyond the fact that it felt like this fact defined every aspect of his being since he was four years old.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His schoolmates would certainly agree. Most of them had never met a quirkless person before, yet they still immediately knew that Izuku was less. The teachers reinforced this standing with their deliberate ignorance and casual cruelty.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had never met another quirkless person, either. It was very very uncommon, particularly in the younger generations. Uncommon, however, didn\u2019t mean non-existent, as he was living proof. So, at age ten, after a taunt from Kacchan about not being and never being Izuku\u2019s friend, Izuku went looking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He researched.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He found several message boards, hidden and surprisingly-well protected (you didn\u2019t need a quirk to hack and Izuku should\u2019ve asked for lessons), and they were enough, for awhile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Life didn\u2019t get better, not really. He still had his homework torn and graded well below his level. He still had burns along his arms and bruises along his back. He still had hours where he couldn\u2019t stomach the thought of people and hid in quiet library alcoves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But he also had people who legitimatized those experiences. People who had the same ones. The burden was lighter, somehow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was enough, until it wasn\u2019t. It was enough, until the first time his teacher (an adult who he didn\u2019t trust yet somehow still thought would be <em>better</em>) muttered under her breath that Izuku should take his classmates\u2019 advice and just disappear. It was enough, until Izuku made it home, bag dragging and ears ringing, to find that a third member of the online group had committed suicide.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He started small. Well, he started by crying long and hard at a volume that had his mom running into his room. She\u2019d stayed with him all night, and by the time the sun rose three movies had been watched, two orders of take out had been demolished, and the Library had a new program on their books.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A support group for extreme bullying and PTSD. Registration required and run through Midoriya Inko and Midoriya Inko alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It took two weeks before the first person showed up, desperation overweighing caution. The next week three people came, encouraged with confirmation by someone else on the message board agreeing that the meeting wasn\u2019t a trap, an excuse for a beatdown.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There were about twenty of them now, though only twelve or so were regulars (and three other support groups for bullying had been established at the library for PTSD because there had been <em>interest </em>and while Inko wouldn\u2019t risk her son, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to turn people <em>away).</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The people of the Group weren\u2019t exactly friends. To be fair, only three of them were remotely close to Izuku\u2019s age. But they were connections. Anchors. They <em>understood.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They also trusted. So when Izuku told the Group, in fits and starts with fingers tapping on hard grey plastic, that he was getting validation, that he was consulting with police and underground heroes, well, they <em>believed. </em>They\u2019d heard his mumbles and his rants for years now, after all. They\u2019d heard his input and suggestions about bad bosses and discrimination and bringing File XR-4 to HR and maybe the police because, no, you can\u2019t be fucking fired like that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They didn\u2019t trust the police and the heroes to help, not without being able to tell for sure that those who were supposed to help weren\u2019t the same bigots the quirkless dealt with everyday. But they trusted Izuku to be able to tell, to do the research before hand and only deal with the best, the trustworthy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first time an abusive boss mentioned in Group had been arrested for extortion and smuggling had proved them right. Izuku\u2019s sunshine smile had been bladed, as he\u2019d spoken that night, feet kicking under his industrial chair, not even meeting the wide eyes of the adults sitting with him in a circle under fluorescent library lights, detailing his week the reasons why his work experience was going oh so <em>well</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku left first, that night after he\u2019d shared his first success, which was unusual, but he hadn\u2019t noticed the slow shuffling as chairs were piled in the corner, too high on <em>helping.</em> His Group, his fellow quirkless, didn\u2019t say anything once he left, but they looked at each other, nodded, and understood.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If Izuku was going to do this, and he <em>was doing this,</em> then they were, too. And so they listened. Not just to Izuku, not just in Group, but at the walls of shitty apartments in rough areas and in jobs that weren\u2019t exactly always on the legitimate side of the table. They paid attention not just to the movements of assholes, but to the moments when discrimination was laced with cruelty. They watched out of cheap windows and if eyes were still hidden by hair then at least they weren\u2019t facing the ground. They became his eyes and ears, his information network.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It had been this boy, the youngest of them, with green curls and white burns, that had started Group. Even if some of them (most) had never thought he\u2019d make it as a hero, thought it some holdover of optimism they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to diminish, they\u2019d always believed him the best of them (he was already their hero, after all).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo then Yuri passed on speaking until the end only to talk about several thefts that were taking place uptown. Which was actually super helpful because I\u2019m working on a profile of the Grabbers for Detective Tsukauchi, and it\u2019s a dumb name but they have fascinating quirks, like most are mutant types but the leader can change the property of metal, for example he can light metal on fire or electrify it and he must have some sort of limitation even though I\u2019ve never found any record of him using anything larger than a short sword. But he carries guns to send out flaming bullets and such, which is actually really cool and-\u201d Inko put her hand on Izuku\u2019s head.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku blushed, before continuing, \u201c-right. So Yuri has a courier job and goes into the higher end of town a lot, so I just thought he was passing on some information about the Grabbers\u2019 quirks. But then Yuri pauses, and like, stares at me? And then gets up and hands me a gun -one of the Grabber\u2019s guns- and said that he was sure I\u2019ll do what needs to be done! And I get it, his courier job is hardly legal across the books and his mother is back in the hospital, but what am I supposed to do with a gun?! I can\u2019t just waltz into the station saying I found it! I have no reason, none, to be in a jewellery shop that high scale across the other side of town!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI mean, I could lie, maybe, but Deku would be taken so much more seriously, but if I just slip the gun in one of envelopes won\u2019t that look like Vigilantism? I don\u2019t want to be a vigilante. You\u2019d be sad and Eraserhead would be disappointed and Tsukauchi would have to arrest me and I didn\u2019t spend months researching and setting Deku up as a consultant to be arrest-\u201c</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cZuku!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku looked at his mom through long bangs, suddenly realizing that he really needed to breathe. After a great gulping breath and a few forced mediative breaths that his mom looked way to amused to be guiding him through, he felt he\u2019d gotten a grip on his mumbling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo. I have a gun from an active crime scene sitting in a plastic bag tucked into in my backpack, along with a half-finished analysis on the gunman, and a Group full of quirkless adults who seem to think I can handle the situation without being a Vigilante.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inko simply smiled and tucked his hair behind his ear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So it was Izuku\u2019d idea to solve his first problems with dead-drops, but it was his mother\u2019s to change envelopes to actual packages, as long as they were accompanied by a well-written note of explantation. She proofread his first explanation detailing, vaguely, how he came into possession of a gun through no fault of his own and was turning it over at his earliest convenience.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was also her idea to wrap the packages like birthday gifts in brightly coloured paper, apparently so they were easily distinguishable as from Deku and not as suspicious. They\u2019d hate to have evidence mistaken as bombs or trash and be destroyed, after all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if Izuku had and Inko were both very tired, not leaving the library\u2019s program room until barely an hour before midnight, then they deserved a laugh. They deserved the giggles that carried them all the way home from the idea of Eraserhead opening a pink and white flowered present in the middle of his patrol.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Tsukauchi regretted all his life choices when he came into work after an actual weekend off to find a small cake on his desk and several co-workers distraught about missing his birthday. He knew, just knew, that the orange and green striped gift on his desk was not only at fault, but also contained a Headache. He felt perfectly justified in eating the cake first.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everything started with a package. A package, not a present, no matter what the bow or Hizashi suggested.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The package was pink. Pink with white spots and it sat in the branches of a tree in a rooftop garden that Eraserhead semi-regularly used to drink a jelly pouch and regroup during his patrols.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The package could have been part of some sort of lovers\u2019 game, but the garden wasn\u2019t particularly <em>nice. </em>The overgrown trees and encroaching weeds topped a low office building in an area that held a veneer of respectability by day and a fog of destitution by night. A romantic gesture here was illogical.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There were no cameras for any sort of verification. Well, there were cameras, but the building\u2019s owner had long stoped paying upkeep charges or hiring anyone to watch them, which was one of the reasons why Eraserhead actually stopped here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta drank his pouch and tried not to glare. While he\u2019d become a hero to help people, particularly the people that society often forgot to help, he\u2019d also become a hero because he was a nosy, curious man who didn\u2019t like to leave puzzles alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And this puzzle was suspicious.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It didn\u2019t get any less suspicious when he hefted himself into the tree only to find <em>to Eraserhead </em>in large, flourished writing. He stared at the tag from the branch above, thinking about who\u2019d he pissed off recently and if anyone was likely to put a bomb in a box for him, when a breeze blew the tag around, revealing <em>from Deku.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So it was a headache in a box.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku, as a consultant, was very good. The research was detailed, the conclusions were backed up, and the suggestions were clever. Even better, Deku clearly labelled when something was an assumption or a estimation and therefore had room for error. Shouta was damn good at improvising, but he always appreciated a heads up that things might go sideways.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was something about Deku, however, that had Shouta wary. It wasn\u2019t a negative wary, the kind that sat is his gut whispering about bad-wrong-incoming, but rather a little flag that kept popping up only to disappear whenever Shouta tried to look at the colour.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku\u2019s type of clever was sharp and fierce, but rough around the edges, like the consultant had very little formal training. The replies were also immediate when Shouta was responding to Deku\u2019s own emails, only ever sent in late afternoon or evening. If Shouta tried an email at any point in the day there was no response, which wasn\u2019t unusual for someone with a traditional day job, which implied that consulting wasn\u2019t Deku\u2019s day job.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which made sense since Deku had yet to ask for the compensation that was really quite deserved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also, and this point bothered Shouta in a way that the other\u2019s didn\u2019t quite manage, Deku was <em>grateful</em> for every response Shouta sent. To the point where any time Shouta added a slight suggestion, such as how a different format might be easier to read or had Deku considered looking from a different angle, they were accounted for immediately.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta had never met another pro, hero or otherwise, who had so little push back on their own work. Who had so little arrogance that they barely had any professional pride.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Professional pride that would have been earned, damnit. Deku might think so far out of the damn box that Shouta wasn\u2019t sure the consultant always realized the box actually existed, but Deku was <em>useful.</em> Deku had helped close six cases in the past two months. Considering the consultant only worked on an average of one case for Shouta a week and presumably worked for other heroes at the same time, that kind of record was damn impressive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Impressive enough that Shouta hadn\u2019t really looked much behind the cloak and dagger, besides vetting the first few rounds of information extensively. He, himself, actively avoided attention, so he couldn\u2019t really judge Deku for doing the same.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With a sigh, Eraserhead split the dark pink box with a knife from his boot and opened the present from Deku.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta was tired. (If one more teacher gave him snark about all his free time since expelling his entire homeroom, he was going to punch them. They all worked for Nezu. There was no excuse for thinking that the rat would give Shouta <em>time off. </em>Such a thought wasn\u2019t just ridiculous, it was <em>illogical.</em>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The point was, he was far too tired to deal with the a broken respirator, a hastily drawn blueprint of what the functioning whole might look like, and a note saying it had been \u2018found in the trash, by accident, honest, but this means that Smokescreen is susceptible to his own quirk and could be disabled by breaking the villain\u2019s suit and hey, Eraserhead, you could contact the manufacturer and get client lists, maybe.\u2019</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat the hell, kid,\u201d he asked the night sky, only to freeze as his own words came tumbling back to him on cool winds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta carefully boxed away his thoughts with the respirator and tucked the package under his arm as he leapt off the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He could only focus on one critical situation at a time, and since the ki-Deku had gifted the evidence to Eraserhead, Deku was still a consultant and not a vigilante. Shouta only had one critical situation, a serial killer who liked to gas his victims, and that case was much closer to being solved than it had been when he started his jelly pouch.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One critical situation and a mess (no formal training, school not work hours, corrections from an authority figure and not suggestions from a colleague- he was teacher, how did he miss - shit).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He could handle a mess. It would be okay (the black clouds that spun at the corner of his dry dry eyes weren\u2019t looming, not yet, because he hadn\u2019t failed again, not yet).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Several packages later and Hizashi opened his door with his hair up in a haphazard bun, an old UA sweater hanging off one shoulder, and a look of utter shock on his face. Shouta ignored this as he marched past his friend and through the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi blinked. \u201cShouta, my man, my honoured coworker and dearest friend, what the actual <em>fuck.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta looked out from long dark hair, nonplussed at actually having to repeat himself. \u201cI need your help.\u201d He shook his head, deciding that three coffees were not nearly enough to beat his fatigue, and moved to steal Hizashi\u2019s.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Voice Hero watched Shouta drain the cup of coffee in its cat-covered mug then skirted Shouta to sit at the table where Hizashi had previously been eating pancakes and grading second year English essays. Hizashi never once took his gaze off his red-eyed friend.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShouta, buddy. It\u2019s 9 am on a Saturday. You\u2019re never up a 9 am on a Saturday unless you have a case. Which you did, last night. I shouldn\u2019t be seeing you until tomorrow at noon after the week you\u2019ve had.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta didn\u2019t say anything for a moment because Hizashi wasn\u2019t wrong, instead just stared at his empty mug with unblinking eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRight.\u201d Hizashi slammed his hands on the table in the act of heaving himself upwards. Both men paused slightly before ignoring Shouta\u2019s flinch at the sound. They\u2019d been friends too long through way too much trauma to not know when to push things and when to leave things the fuck alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi did drape his sweater over the tired man\u2019s shoulders as he passed into the kitchen, pointing Shouta into a chair. \u201cSit down. I\u2019m going to make you a smoothie because I respect your love of liquid fruit while hating those damn pouches and your general food habits. While I complete this remarkable gesture of true friendship, you are going to sit at that table and tell me what is going on and why you need my, obviously excellent, help this bright and early morning.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta slumped into the chair more rag doll than man. \u201cI fucked up, Zashi.\u201d Shouta\u2019s words were quiet, spoken directly into the worn wood of the table. Hizashi wouldn\u2019t have heard them at all if he hadn\u2019t slipped his hearing aids in while on route to the kitchen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo it\u2019s a strawberry smoothie day, then?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta huffed out a poor man\u2019s attempt at a laugh. \u201cYeah.\u201d He listened to Hizashi putter around in the kitchen for several moments, letting the sounds of cupboards thumping accent the thrum of Hizashi\u2019s beast of a fridge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta loved his friends, for all that pulling teeth would never be enough to get him to admit it. He loved that there was never any doubt that Hizashi would help him, only the man trying to figure out how to help and sliding into the old standard of feeding Shouta as a start.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His love of his friends was also the reason why he pretended not to notice Hizashi texting someone, probably Nemuri, while blending the soon to be smoothie. (It was Nemuri, she and Hizashi had a tried and true Taking Care of Shouta Plan and the man actually asking either one of them for help outside of cases was the reddest of red flags.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cheek pressed into the cool wood, Shouta stared at the loose pages of Hizashi\u2019s marking, done in blue pen so not to be discouraging. Shouta always used red.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku was probably used to a lot of red.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDo you remember Deku?\u201d Shouta asked the papers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi hummed in response, sliding the smoothie over to his friend and taking the swat beside him, across from the marking. \u201cYour new consultant?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta made a noise of consent while wrapping long fingers around the cool glass.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell yeah, then. I was actually playing with seeing if I could borrow him for a bit if we don\u2019t get any leads on this phantom robber within in the week. I know you said he plays best underground, but we\u2019re getting a bit desperate.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMore of a wariness of daylight agencies. Deku would help, though, especially if I vouched for you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBut? There\u2019s a definite but there, Shou. Did Deku turn out to be on the take or something?\u201d Hizashi tapped the table in a low pattern.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Hizashi raised a brow along with his tone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta looked up, finally, head drawn straight like it had been attached to a piano wire suddenly pulled taught. The shadows under he eyes were starker than usual and voice rougher still. \u201cDeku\u2019s a kid, Zashi. A goddamn kid. Can\u2019t be much older than our students.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi could have asked Shouta if he was sure, but Shouta wasn\u2019t known for expelling students for shits and giggles. Shouta knew his own reputation, revelled in it, most of the time. Both in terms of the fear he instilled in students and faculty, and in the sheer level of chaos he could create (he was Nezu\u2019s favourite for a reason, and that reason wasn\u2019t just Shouta\u2019s level of sheer competency; you needed a certain mindset to interact with the Principal of UA so frequently and not go running for the damn hills).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But the kids that graduated with Shota\u2019s approval all became strong, living heroes. Shouta <em>checked. </em>His classes might have the fewest graduates, but damn it all, they had some of the best survival rates in the whole damn county (they didn\u2019t have to mourn their friends, didn\u2019t have to watch their worlds shatter around them, didn\u2019t have to have their own Oboro weighing their hearts and clouding their eyes).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta had good people skills, which drove Hizashi and Nemuri to despair, because Shouta simply didn\u2019t use them for interaction. People were stupid and catering to them wasted energy. Reading them and their behaviour was much more valuable, and allowed Shouta to act only when he wanted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wanted to act.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He knew Deku was a kid. He knew from Deku\u2019s mannerisms and the hesitations between written words. He knew from that place in his gut which clenched when kids thought being a hero was about fun, fame, and fortune. He knew from that place in his throat that stopped his breath when when a kid pushed that much harder, when they had a <em>reason</em> to be a hero and Shouta could help them. He knew from that place in his eyes that seared with shadows and clouds and darkness when he was caught in his own past or seeing a child he couldn\u2019t help, not in time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This wasn\u2019t proof. This wasn\u2019t evidence. This wasn\u2019t enough to do <em>anything </em>with, not officially.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this was Hizashi, not Present Mic, and while Hizashi wasn\u2019t official, he was Shouta\u2019s best friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi clapped his hands together, simply accepting Shouta\u2019s statement. \u201cRight. So teenage consultant with a side of brilliance. Unusual. But I\u2019m not seeing the crisis just yet?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta scowled, a slow motion that began with his eyebrows and ended locked in his jaw. Hizashi\u2019s sweater weighed down Shouta\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi waved a hand. \u201cHey, hey, hey. None of that. Just cause I\u2019m not on the same train of leaping logic doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be. I believe you and believe you wouldn\u2019t be here this early on a sunny Saturday unless there was a problem larger than a bit of underage employment. So tell me what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi\u2019s voice was louder by the end, which wasn\u2019t unusual, though the hand now covering Shouta\u2019s was. It was only as the warm skin settled on Shouta\u2019s fingers that he realized he\u2019d been trembling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He really needed to sleep. Eventually. He\u2019d gotten two hours after his shower in the adrenaline crash after the trafficking ring they\u2019d taken down. It was barely enough, but was all he could get with Deku\u2019s multiple packages floating through his dreams.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta sighed, shifting his hand slowly until he\u2019d reversed the palm and was able to grasp Hizashi\u2019s hand in his. Shouta made sure to study the wood grain\u2019s pattern against various coloured ink stains instead of looking up to see the expression on his oldest friend\u2019s face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI suspected about a month ago. Deku started leaving packages. I\u2019m not sure how many of us get them, Tsukauchi and I definitely, holding evidence. Support gear, quirk remnants, stolen goods, all with a note explaining it had fallen in Deku\u2019s lap and they thought I could use it better. All with a very explicit note saying the kid wasn\u2019t trying to be a vigilante.\u201d Shouta held his free hand up, splayed wide. \u201cI\u2019ve received three in the last month, Zashi, just sitting along my patrol routes, wrapped in paper and bows.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi snorted, tightening the hand over Shouta\u2019s even as Hizashi met his friend\u2019s red glare. \u201cSorry, just, the kid sent you presents? That\u2019s great. I love them already.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta kept the glare for a beat longer, then let it melt into a toothy grin. \u201cThis first was in pink and white spotted paper.\u201d The pink had matched the pair of sweatpants Nemuri had gotten him perfectly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The burst of laughter than rang around the room was loud, but not quite enough to trigger Shouta using Erasure. \u201cOh, the kid\u2019s a keeper Shou.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhAT?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi looked sheepish, even as Shouta\u2019s hair settled and he continued. \u201cDeku is brilliant, being young doesn\u2019t change that, neither does the possibility the kid has an intelligence quirk. Honestly, I\u2019m even more impressed because the kid convince multiple professionals whose jobs are literally to be suspicious that they were receiving adult level assistance. Deku is already skating the line of vigilantism, despite what the kid is claiming, regardless of intent. We can\u2019t let Deku slip into villainy. That would be bad, very bad, if we\u2019re assuming the kid will get even better with time. Which I\u2019m absolutely sure is the case.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All mirth had faded from Hizashi\u2019s face. \u201cAnd you think villainy is a likely concern? Seems extreme.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta let out a sharp laugh that sounded like broken glass. \u201cExtreme? Why isn\u2019t this kid in hero school? Why do they feel the need to make up a name and help without telling anyone who they are? Without telling a hero? Hizashi, we both know that kids idolize heroes and that the hero path tends to be their first choice.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s not? Don\u2019t give me that look. I trust you, Shou, but you\u2019re making an awful lot of assumptions considering you don\u2019t know the kid\u2019s identity. Deku could be in hero school and chafing under restrictions. Or, I don\u2019t know, younger than high school and planning to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta studied their hands, particularly his rough and slightly dirty nails against the scuffed gold of the ring Hizashi received from his grandfather. \u201cZashi, I\u2019ve studied the emails Deku sent. Poured over them, to be honest. This kid isn\u2019t okay. This kid has a desperate desire to help people, yet is choosing to do so as something other than a hero, secretly. That in itself raises all sorts of flags.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe rest of my reasons are in Deku\u2019s words. Zashi, there\u2019s <em>no </em>arrogance in those words. None. There\u2019s professional pride, barely, in the bones of assured validity and acknowledgement of consequences, but no bragging, no gloating, no acceptance of a job well done. There is, however, a frightening amount of dedication to the \u2018what ifs\u2019 and an almost pathological notation every single time something is based on a supposition or scarce evidence. It doesn\u2019t matter that a few scant months in and I\u2019d already take a guess from Deku over witness reports from most civilians, hell, even several Pros. Every guess is all but labelled in capital letters with an inscribed \u2018please use your own judgement.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta squeezed Hizashi\u2019s hand once to stop the man from speaking, knowing there was one more bit to say. \u201cAnd I experimented. The kid <em>doesn\u2019t believe </em>praise. I\u2019ve been including more thanks and compliments in my emails and have learned that, apparently, it\u2019s absolutely possible to convey \u2018flusterd\u2019 over email. Deku denies or deflects everything to my own efforts. Somehow, this kid is utterly confident in his analysis ability, yet completely unable to see that his ability makes him special.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBut that alone wouldn\u2019t make me worry about villainy, Hizashi. We both know good heroes have a <em>reason </em>for choosing heroics, and it\u2019s not often very pleasant. I\u2019d bet my scarf that this kid has one of those reasons. Yet anytime I even hint that Deku might have hero potential I get shut down. Hard. Not as if there\u2019s no interest, but as if Deku is completely resigned that consultant is as far as they could ever reach. If the kid\u2019s situation has led to that, then, I-\u201c</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta ended on a growl when the words stopped coming, getting tangled in his throat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi understood that growl, had heard it several times over the years. He slid his second hand over his first, covering the tips of Shouta\u2019s fingernails. \u201cYou\u2019re worried that the little listener\u2019s reason is something like abuse or a villainous quirk. That the environment or people around will take away whatever confidence that has let them grasp at consulting as a way to help.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi\u2019s words slammed into Shouta with the weight of a heavy door. The old oak panels, maybe, that had blocked out the light when Shouta had been thrown into the cellar for accidentally erasing his parents\u2019 quirks. Or the heavy metal plating that had slammed hard enough to break bones when the upperclassman\u2019s verdict to punish the school \u2018villain\u2019 involved storage rooms and darkness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe kid isn\u2019t okay, Zashi. It\u2019s not okay.\u201d Shouta hadn\u2019t been okay, not then, when the darkness that burned in his eyes was from locked doors and could still lead to tears.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThen we\u2019ll make it okay.\u201d Hizashi squeezed Shouta\u2019s hands before leaning back in his chair with crossed arms and a cocky smile on his face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Despite all of Shouta\u2019s best intentions, he felt a small smile start to grow on his own lips. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe\u2019re heroes, Shou, it\u2019s what we do. Sides,\u201d Hizashi\u2019s grin slid crooked as his head tilted, \u201cYou\u2019ve never been wrong about a kid having potential yet.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta thought of emails, about the fact he still wasn\u2019t sure how this kid had even found Eraserhead\u2019s email in the first place. He thought of plans upon plans upon backup plans. He thought of the section included on every single report about minimizing civilian casualties. He thought about the comments laced with worry regarding Eraserhead\u2019s own workload. He thought of analysis whose quality hadn\u2019t decreased one bit when there was only one possible victim.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Shouta said quietly, \u201cThey have potential.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYEAH! Then lets adopt you a little listener!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Shouta, red-eyed, asked as Hizashi, unrepentant, stood up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cReally. Drink your smoothie. You have a plan to update me on. Tell me how you\u2019re going to woo the kid to the bright side of legal heroics and formal educational institutions!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta stood as well, slipping his arms into Hizashi\u2019s sweater properly and dutifully taking a sip of the still rather tasty smoothie. He let his grin grow into the toothy thing that he knew terrified his students and, to be perfectly honest, several of his fellow staff.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He opened his phone and slid his first messages with Deku across the table for Hizashi to read. Shouta then carefully dumped the bag that had been sitting by his feet on the table, revealing his laptop, three cameras, two mirrors, and his goggles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI sent Deku my own gift and got the kid\u2019s phone number. It\u2019s, obviously, a burner. Now we\u2019re going to lure the analyst with analysis. And a side of validation.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi had looked up as the items hit the table, but had quickly gone back to the phone, scrolling down to read the rest of the kid\u2019s questions (if Shouta hadn\u2019t been convinced that Deku was a kid originally, that text would have cinched it; the kid <em>babbled)</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOkay, I\u2019m impressed, especially since I know both how little information on you is actually available and how tight lipped you are in general. But don\u2019t you know most of the answers to the limits of your quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta shrugged. \u201cMost. But I haven\u2019t really explored my quirk since we were students. Things change. Hell,\u201d he he gestured to one of the newer cameras, \u201ctechnology changes.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi looked up slowly. \u201cSo. Tell me if I\u2019m getting this straight. Instead of spending the morning marking the papers of kids who barely understand what a period is, much less a comma, I get to help my best friend, who I was expecting to have to drag out of his sleeping bag tomorrow evening for food and human interaction, play with his quirk. All in order to help a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nose twitching, Shouta, preemptively silence Hizashi. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhoo! I\u2019m texting Nemuri!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you already do that?\u201d They both stared at each other for a moment after Shouta\u2019s dry as dust question, silently debating whether to acknowledge that Shouta did, indeed, know of the Take Care of Shouta Plan.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hizashi broke first, all sunny smiles. \u201cYep! But now I\u2019m telling her to bring lunch! We\u2019re making this a day. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll let you nap. I found the sleeping bag you left in my closet, don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Hizashi continued to type away Shouta let his head rest on the table, making sure to face the door and thus hide any chance of his smile being spotted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019d make it okay. (It was already approaching okay, now that the warmth of Hizashi\u2019s voice could remind Shouta that the shadowed clouds weren\u2019t physically there, weren\u2019t dark rooms or Oboro\u2019s loss blocking light from his quirk-dry eyes.)</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead thumped his purple and orange wrapped package down onto Detective Tsukauchi\u2019s desk about a month after the hero\u2019s talk with Hizashi, right next to the man\u2019s yellow and green one. Shouta had meant to do this earlier, but he\u2019d been <em>busy.</em> \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi stared at the two boxes for a moment before leaning forward and pinching his nose. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t be here to tell me Deku has crossed into vigilantism. My boss is already leaning down my neck about it, but Deku is the most useful CI slash consultant we\u2019ve had in years. Don\u2019t take that away from me and give me more paperwork at the same time. Just don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta looked down at the slumped detective, commiserating heavily with the exhaustion in his posture. \u201cI\u2019m not here for that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Squinting up at Shouta, Tsukauchi shook his head. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I comforted?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBecause you actually know me,\u201d Shouta deadpanned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRight,\u201d Tsukauchi snorted. He then kicked out the wooden chair next to his desk with one scuffed boot. \u201cSit and tell me where all my free time is about to go.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou get free time?\u201d Shouta slouched into the chair, arms dangling over the sides in a deliberately casual motion that he knew Tsukauchi wouldn\u2019t believe for a second. Which was fine, since Shouta was more trying to convince himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi snorted a second time. \u201cAbout as much as you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta just smirked. Tsukauchi was one of the rare few Shouta would probably call a friend, for all they\u2019d never so much as shared a meal together that didn\u2019t involve work. What they did share, however, was an unofficial job that drove them both into the ground, even if they\u2019d never give it up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi had met Nezu, and was one of the even rarer few who not only had no comment when Shouta had expelled his entire class, but had also looked at Shouta with sympathy, understanding all too easily the sort of running around the Principal would have him do. Tsukauchi faced a similar fate, after all, since it was amazing how many cases seemed to need a human lie detecter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo spill, Eraser. To my knowledge we aren\u2019t on a joint case, unless Deku dropped something special into your lap.\u201d Tsukauchi waved a hand to the two packages with their bright boxes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta paused, eyes tracing the ceiling panels, before deciding to just do as the detective asked. \u201cDeku\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta nodded. \u201cThat was my reaction.\u201d He let that sit in the air for a moment, still looking at fluorescent lights until his eyes started to burn. \u201cIt gets worse.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c\u2018Course it does.\u201d Tsukauchi laid both palms flat on the battered metal of his desk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHe\u2019s <em>quirkless.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cDouble shit.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They were both quiet. They both not only knew the statistics for the quirkless, but lived the realities.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead, by nature of his late patrols and habit of traveling by rooftop, had talked more than a few jumpers off ledges (the clouds floating at the edges of his vision always got worse when he failed them, always felt like an anchor of loss dragging from his eyes to his limbs, and he was already fucking <em>attached </em>because the thought of Deku, of <em>Midoriya Izuku, </em>up on one of those rails was all but blinding).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi\u2019s first partner on the force had been quirkless. The woman had retired now, but Tsukauchi had credited her with teaching him to be a good cop, one who was more than just his quirk. He\u2019d had more than a few drinks the night Tsukauchi had told Shouta about her, after a bad case where a mother had drowned her quirkless child, along with a rant full of anger that his former partner had never risen as far in the ranks as Tsukauchi had known she should have.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI tracked the kid to his school. It wasn\u2019t fucking easy; the kid is careful, but he hasn\u2019t been trained.\u201d Shouta had briefly debated bringing in the big guns, but he really didn\u2019t want to go quite that far just yet. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with what I saw at that school. Deku\u2019s definitely getting bullied and the staff are absolutely complicit.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNezu?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be throwing the school to him eventually, but I don\u2019t want to spook the kid.\u201d Shouta sighed, thinking of the sadistic joy he\u2019d felt as Nezu taught Shouta to raze his former school to the ground. Then he thought of storage rooms with broken desks and the way that even as he\u2019d hated the dark back then, he\u2019d still trusted the dark far more than that sliver of light under the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta ran a hand through long hair, grimacing when his fingers caught in a snarl. \u201cI\u2019d have spooked. If someone had tried to tell me everything I knew was wrong and that they were going to fix it, for free, I\u2019d have run. Far. And I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d find Deku, if he truly went to ground.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi was an excellent reader of body language, as most good cops are, so merely put his chin is hand and let Shouta avoid eye contact. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t go full stalker, then?\u201d He asked, drily.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta closed his eyes and bared his teeth, just a bit. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The detective\u2019s hesitation was evident enough that Shouta opened one eye and actually met Tsukauchi\u2019s gaze. The man didn\u2019t look away. \u201cCan I ask about the family?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust a mother. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s good. Possibly very good. The kid looks at her like she\u2019s his whole world. She looks at hecklers like she would smack them with her purse and punch them in the nose for insulting her baby if she didn\u2019t have to an example to set.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi let out a gusty breath. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d The man turned sideways in his chair to fully face Shouta, arm slung over the coat draped along the back. \u201cSo. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe plan is to make him my intern. I don\u2019t have an official agency to run through hoops and the Underground Coalition I\u2019m part of is easy to manage. The heroes and staff who work there are well used to cagey underground heroes who may be willing to share resources but rarely full personal stories. Besides, I have seniority, which basically just means they know me. They\u2019ll have no trouble believing I had my intern pose as a consultant for a logical ruse to test reactions and treatment of the kid. It would also solve the payment issue I know must have bothered you as much as me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi nodded, slowly. \u201cNot bad. It would also quell any official worries about vigilantism and provide oversight to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t bite off more than he can chew.\u201d Tsukauchi clapped his hands, eerily reminiscent of Hizashi, as a large grin spread across his face. His eyes even started sparkling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta didn\u2019t trust sparkling eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPlan A: Adoption: I\u2019m in.\u201d The sparkles were almost evident in Tsukauchi\u2019s tone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta stared at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi just nodded again, as if Shouta had responded. \u201cGet me the paperwork, Eraser, and I can backdate it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was a long pause full of suffering (Shouta was best friends with <em>Present Mic, </em>he knew how to be dramatic) and then a soft thump.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi paused for another long moment as he met eyes that just dared him to comment. He stared at the folder that was now sitting on his desk, then back at Shouta and the hero\u2019s complete lack of bag or obvious large pocket.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi obviously bit back some sigh-grin combo.\u201cRight. I look forward to meeting my new nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta twitched. \u201cI haven\u2019t even talked to the kid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi proceeded to give Shouta the deadpan stare of a man who is lied to constantly, despite the general knowledge that this is Not a Good Idea.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta considered returning the I\u2019m Tired Do Not Fuck With Me look he\u2019d perfected on his students, then decided that the faint vibration of his phone in his pocket already meant he\u2019d lost this battle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHis name\u2019s Midoriya. I\u2019ll add you to the chat.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shouta left the station with an ally, a folder of completed paperwork, and a new group chat (the shadowed burning behind Shouta\u2019s eyes lessened with each word the kid typed).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku got Eraserhead\u2019s phone number on a Friday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">School had finished for the weekend and Izuku was catching his breath after a mad dash out of the building to avoid Kacchan.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The bright pink box was impossible to ignore, even tucked up in a tree. It wasn\u2019t one of Izuku\u2019s usual trees, in that he generally tried to avoid using the same drop-off spot more than once every few months. It was inconvenient as hell, but he really didn\u2019t want to be caught. Or stopped.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This tree, however, was along one of Eraserhead\u2019s favourite patrol routes, and within sight of three different locations Deku had used before.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And the box was wrapped in pink with white unicorns.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku stared at it a moment, out of the corner of his eye. Then looked around at the relatively empty street, already covered in shadows due to the early fading light of winter.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He bit his lip, splitting it open again and tasting iron.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku knew, just knew, that the gift was for Deku. He didn\u2019t know what was inside, wasn\u2019t sure if it was a trap, but it was for <em>him. </em>It was for him and from Eraserhead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He <em>wanted </em>it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The box was relatively easy to get down; Izuku had often lost bullies in the park by quickly scaling trees and then staying very still. He shoved the package in his school bag, squashing his completed math homework, with barely a glance at the clearly scrawled \u2018Deku\u2019 in thick black marker.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he got home, slamming into the empty apartment, he retreated straight to his room, throwing the bag on the floor while holding the impossibly light box on his lap.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The pink and white of the paper was vibrant against his emerald comforter. The box underneath was small, the kind you\u2019d get at a bakery for a couple of pastries, and inside was a single sheet of paper.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he entered the number in his phone, two hours later after buying a burner just for this moment, his hand vibrated so hard he had to retype the digits twice, and the message three times.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>Hello?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Deku. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku fanboyed for longer this time, closer to twenty minutes, despite his previous communications with the hero. He used the time productively, though, and managed to control his mutterstorm.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead therefore received one full paragraph containing questions about his quirk instead of five (apparently Izuku found email easier for maintaining professionalism).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Wow.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead:<em> I\u2019ll get back to that. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Do you have anything on the Nakamura brothers? There\u2019s a raid tonight on a human trafficking ring, and they\u2019re involved. You mentioned them possibly fencing for the Grabbers. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>Sorry!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>Oh yeah, give me half an hour? I have a basic analysis started. You want quirks/strengths/weakness for the raid?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Please.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Half an hour\u2019s fine. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And it was fine. Izuku completed his battle analysis, texted the documents to Eraser, and wished the man good luck. All without losing his shit, again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The best part, by far, was the next day. Izuku, for the first time in ages, woke to a text notification on his phone. Eraserhead was brief, probably exhausted, but he <em>thanked </em>Izuku and let the boy know that the raid was successful. That Izuku helped saved thirteen teenagers from being sold out of country.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then, then Eraser got<em> back to that. </em>He texted Izuku that his quirk worked in mirrors and glass, only weaker, and that he hadn\u2019t tried it much over video but after an experiment that morning it turns out the effectiveness depends on the quality of the camera. He shared that he often left his hair down for the intimidation factor, but would tie it up for stealth missions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead answered all of Izuku\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku was actually rather proud of how quickly he got used to texting the underground hero, particularly since Eraserhead was now the second most used contact in his phone. Also since Eraserhead had always been in Izuku\u2019s top five favourite heroes; the man worked practically quirkless! He probably would have been consistently second or even first if he hadn\u2019t been so hard to find information on, at least before the hero started working with Deku.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead asked Izuku for quick analysis of images sometimes, or texted Izuku updates to fast moving cases. Izuku still emailed large packages of information for general cases or neighbourhoods, but the vast majority of their communication now happened over text.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By the fourth week of texts, Izuku almost had his instinctive need to squeal under control. It helped that Izuku <em>liked </em>Eraserhead, as a person, and that Eraserhead actually seemed to enjoy their conversations, despite his tendency to reply in one word or less.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Really the only incident that week occurred when the man sent Izuku a cat picture. Literally just a picture of an alley cat twining about Eraserhead\u2019s ankles with no explanation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku\u2019s hard-fought (non-existent) decorum went out the window durning the fifth week, however.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead added Tsukauchi to the chat.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Tsukauchi wanted to talk. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>Thanks for the advice on the Incisor, you were spot on.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>Detective Tsukauchi! No problem. Did you manage to find out his motive? You must have, your quirk is so cool! Did he still try to lie? Or tell half truths? Does that work? Can you tell? What about if they believe they\u2019re telling the truth? Like a fanatic? Do you check body language as well, you must have other indicators with your record. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>Um. Oops. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>Wow, Eraser, you were right. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been fanboyed on. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>Thanks, kid. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: S<em>orry!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>And I\u2019m not a kid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Very convincing.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Kid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>Don\u2019t worry about it, kid. We\u2019re keeping you.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead: <em>Agreed.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tsukauchi: <em>To useful too even think otherwise.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deku: <em>\u2026Ok.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Izuku had three contacts in his phone, looked for cats on his way to school, and tried not cry when Tsukauchi texted both him and Eraserhead to <em>go to damn sleep already, it\u2019s important for growing bodies, set a goddamn example, Eraser. </em>Izuku didn\u2019t always succeed.)</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everything ended with an essay.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was a stupid essay, so so easy, and that was the problem. Izuku had pulled an all nighter drafting an analysis of several businesses to help Bubble Girl trail some dirty money for her third (and hopefully not misogynistic) boss. The essay for school, asking for a review of an industry and its connections or reliance on quirks, was much simpler.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Except Izuku wrote the essay honestly. He had all this information floating around in his head from Bubble Girl\u2019s case, and he\u2019d forgotten all about his homework so had to write the paper on two hours of sleep. He\u2019d barely had time to print the thing, much less do any editing, before meekly handing it to the teacher and passing out at his desk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That had been a week ago. This week had included getting a zero in front of the whole class and receiving detention for plagiarizing, because the worthless, useless, quirkless Izuku could not have written a perfect paper.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku could have dealt with that, though. The jeering sucked, the detention took away his consulting time, and the condescension was irritating, but he had a hero and a police detective and his mom all thinking he was great. Bubble girl had also thanked him <em>twice </em>and his mom was trying to convince Izuku that as Deku it would be perfectly acceptable to ask for Bubble Girl\u2019s phone number to make communication easier.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So Izuku could handle the school-sanctioned bullying. What he\u2019d forgotten, beyond the fact that he wasn\u2019t supposed to put<em> Deku-level effort </em>into<em> schoolwork,</em> was that Kacchan knew him. Kacchan knew that the one thing Izuku had was his brain. He knew Izuku would never plagiarize. Therefore, Kacchan knew that Izuku had written a paper better than Kacchan\u2019s own.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku being better at Kachaan in something made the exploding boy <em>angry. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So Izuku found himself leaning against a rail that edged the school roof, staring into the frozen pond as the temperature dropped faster than the sun. He was leaning too far forward on the rail, he knew he was, but the position let up just a bit of pressure in his back. Which hurt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It had been a while since Kachhan had been that devoted to chasing him down. There really hadn\u2019t been much chance of Izuku escaping, not today.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku closed his eyes and let the cool air creep under his singed jacket and brush against his fevered skin. He couldn\u2019t go to the library and meet his mom, not with these injuries.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku needed to treat them before she saw, because his injuries would hurt her. He just couldn\u2019t quite handle going home to an empty apartment yet, not with him unable to focus on anything but the image of his teacher tearing his paper to shreds in front of a jeering class and fuming Kacchan.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He was more upset about the paper than the burns.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had written that paper with Deku\u2019s information, in Deku\u2019s mindset, with Deku\u2019s standards. It felt like his teacher had torn apart Deku\u2019s work, not Izuku\u2019s, and that made <em>Izuku </em>angry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wasn\u2019t used to being angry. Anger never helped him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The metal under his hands was slick beneath white knuckles, but allowed him to feel the faint vibration of another person before he saw their shadow out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to jump.\u201d Izuku probably would have been more believable without the rasp in his throat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The stranger lent on the rail, black shirt baggy and stark against the rail as he rested his hip against it. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku didn\u2019t look up, even as his sluggish thoughts start turning around because there was <em>something</em> about that voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A phone was waved in front of Izuku\u2019s face, an image of a tortoiseshell cat sitting on fence weaving in front of his eye. \u201cYou didn\u2019t reply to Miss. Marsh\u2019s most recent photo. Thought I\u2019d get your opinion in person.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku turned so slowly he should have creaked. As he took in long dark hair, bruised eyes, rough stubble, and thin scarf at least three times as long as Izuku was tall, he blinked.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cEraserhead.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDeku.\u201d The man smirked.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If Izuku\u2019s hand didn\u2019t feel frozen to the rail, if he wasn\u2019t absolutely certainly that if he released his grip his fingers would tremble, Izuku would have probably flailed right off that roof.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead clearly thought so too, since he wrapped an end of his capture weapon several times around Izuku\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShit.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice had lost the rasp but gained a squeak. He didn\u2019t think it an improvement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead evidently did, since his smirk widened. \u201cLanguage, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to jump.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead raised a single eyebrow before repeating, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku raised his captured wrist without letting go of the rail.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With a snort, Eraserhead shifted and leaned on the rail himself. \u201cYou\u2019re<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>slippery.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They were quiet for a moment, wind slipping by, before Izuku drew a deep shuddering breath. \u201cIs this where you tell me to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo?\u201d Izuku asked, a bit incredulous. \u201cBut you know my age,\u201d he hesitated, \u201cand that I\u2019m quirkless.\u201d Because Eraserhead did know. If the man had tracked Izuku to his school, then the hero absolutely knew exactly who Izuku was.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re not a vigilante.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku waited, but when the man wasn\u2019t any more forthcoming, he spoke again, \u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m going to need more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eraserhead sighed, peering out through the side of one dark eye. \u201cYou help people using that ridiculous brain of yours and don\u2019t break the law to do it. You\u2019re not a vigilante; you\u2019re literally being as safe as possible. While being incredibly, frighteningly useful. Problem child, why would I tell you to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku had turned so his full body faced the Underground hero, only his hands tying him to the rail. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you tracked me down to show me a cat picture?\u201d The squeak in Izuku\u2019s voice had yet to go away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHmm. Well that, and to give you this.\u201d Eraserhead pulled a white envelope out of his capture scarf.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku narrowed tired eyes at the paper. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYour pay check.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMy what?!\u201d Izuku straightened so rapidly he saw white spots dance. His back was not happy with that motion.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cConsultants get paid, Deku.\u201d Eraserhead looked almost bored, as he stared down and the green boy with a feline head tilt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Izuku sputtered. He was positive Eraserhead enjoyed Izuku\u2019s suffering.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Eraserhead said, as if there had been sense in the sounds Izuku had made. \u201cYou did make things difficult, problem child. Tsukauchi made sure everything was up to date on the police side of things, while I coordinated the underground heroes I\u2019d put you in touch with. They were quite happy to let me organize the matter on behalf of my intern, though most were quite insistent they get to meet you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYour-\u201c Izuku didn\u2019t finish. Couldn\u2019t finish.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHero intern. It seemed the logical solution considering your age. If you don\u2019t want to be a hero, however, we\u2019ll set up proper consulting rates.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apparently, Eraserhead did, in fact, know Izuku quite well. It turned out that<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>Izuku\u2019s hands were not stuck to the rail, and that he was quite capable of flailing himself off the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The capture weapon around Izuku\u2019s wrist wasn't nearly as warm as the smirk on Eraserhead\u2019s tired face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Izuku <em>wanted.</em>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Everything escalated with a meeting. On a on roof. On the edge of a roof. Because this kid took Plus Ultra far too seriously.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta hadn\u2019t been concerned when he'd seen Midoriya (whom Shouta wasn\u2019t stalking, thank you very much Hizashi and Tsukauchi) on the roof of the boy\u2019s school (which he had just happened to add to his patrol routes a couple times of week, there had been several muggings in the area and those were <em>crimes </em>and he was a <em>hero)</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He hadn\u2019t been concerned, but Shouta had gotten to that roof fairly quickly (he remembered tracking trails of blood from storage closets to the roof to get lost in all that space).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He hadn\u2019t been concerned, exactly, but had wrapped his scarf multiple time around the boy\u2019s wrist (the shadows at the corner of Shouta\u2019s eyes, the ones made of dark versions of Oboro\u2019s clouds, burned sharp and cold at thought that Shouta could be <em>wrong). </em>Deku was <em>helping </em>and Shouta was pretty sure that was more than enough to ground the boy he\u2019d been texting, but better safe than sorry.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He also hadn\u2019t expected the be enveloped in a death hug, but apparently Midoriya liked to prove expectations wrong. As much as Shouta wasn\u2019t good with feelings (he was self-aware, thank you Hizashi), this was a much preferable option to the one he hadn\u2019t be concerned about, yet couldn\u2019t ignore.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even if there were tears. Midoriya was apparently a crier.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Awkwardly, he knew it was awkwardly, Shouta, wrapped his arms around the bony shoulders that dug into Shouta\u2019s chest. He was careful in his placement of weight, wanting Midoriya to know Shouta was returning the affection, but very aware the kid was a bit beat up (his jacket was fucking singed?) and not wanting to make Midoriya feel restricted.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The weight just seemed to make the kid cry harder and Shouta leant back on the rail slightly, resigned to wait everything out the moment he felt small hands fisting in the back of his shirt. He figured the kid deserved a good round of hysterics, even if Shouta was the least comforting presence he could have imagined.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It took about thirty minutes for Midoriya to calm down enough for Shouta to cajole him down and out of the building. Neither commented on the fact that Shouta didn\u2019t release the kid from the capture scarf until they\u2019d passed the edge of the school grounds. Nor did they address the fact that about a block down the road, Midoriya had raised a trembling hand and grasped the edge of Shouta\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The gesture was perhaps a little juvenile, but Shouta deeply understood the need to make sure that the good thing didn\u2019t disappear (Hizashi was loud, which was annoying, but at least Shouta always knew he was <em>there).</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They also weren\u2019t talking about Shouta\u2019s promise on the roof. Midoriya had taken the envelope, a little reverent, and held it carefully in his free hand, but Shouta knew the boy was afraid that Shouta would take it all back if asked anything more. Which was annoying, but understandable, if the kid had even fared half as badly as Shouta anticipated under the label of quirkless.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They get it all sorted out soon enough.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the mean time, Shouta brought up his recent meeting with the Wild Wild Pussycats and watched the kid go. The rescue group didn\u2019t exactly work in their area and Midoriya didn\u2019t need to consult with rescue heroes very much, but one mention was all the kid needed to go off on the group's strategies and quirks.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta knew the kid could ramble, he\u2019d seen it over text and bit over email as the kid had gotten more comfortable. It was another thing entirely, to hear Midoriya in person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He\u2019d started out actually talking to Shouta, but midway through discussing Mandalay\u2019s quirk and it uses in reaching trapped civilians he devolved into what could only be called a mutterstorm. And while reading Midoriya\u2019s ramblings had been interesting, listening to the kid\u2019s mutterings was <em>fascinating. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He branched out from Mandalay\u2019s quirk in rescue situations to potential support gear, skirting but clearly understanding the basic science behind various devices. He then took an abrupt turn into branding, and how smart the Pussycats's cutesy theme was, causing not only villains to underestimate them and civilians to calm quicker, but also considering the societal perceptions of quirks that involve the mind. He proceeded to backtrack on himself, regarding the thought that Mandalay\u2019s quirk might not be as threatening because it\u2019s only one way, but then detailed how she could use it for some kind of subliminal messaging or for driving someone insane.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This kid.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta had third years (expelling his homeroom didn\u2019t mean he got out of teaching courses for other years) who he still had to pull teeth just to get them to think about influences from the Hero Commission, much less societal views as a whole.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta watched the boy out of the corner of his eye as the kid talked and Shouta tried to decide if getting lectured by a middle schooler would motivate or demoralize his older students. Except Shouta got distracted, because Midoriya was <em>smiling </em>as he rambled<em>. </em>He was smiling at being dragged somewhere by a grumpy Shouta. In the dark.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They would have to work on his self preservation instincts (the kid and Hizashi must never meet or their combined sunshine would be so bright that Shouta would never get to sleep again).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya snorted, softly, then immediately blushed. And shit, Shouta had said that bit about the instincts out loud.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The hand in his shirt tightened, slightly, before Shouta could do something stupid like blush in return.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have instincts, Eraserhead. But I trust you, and more than that, I know you. Um, I mean not like <em>know </em>you, but I know you work for UA and with the police and, well, you\u2019re going to do this the right way? And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know my way home from school.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta sighed, raising his eyes to the dark sky. The kid had a point. Shouta couldn\u2019t really expect that Midoriya didn\u2019t have enough on Eraserhead to do a pretty thorough analysis by now. And he wanted Midoriya to trust him. But still.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou\u2019re not worried that I also know your way home?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI mean,\u201d Midoriya tugged on his worn jacket with his free hand, \u201cI kinda figured you would?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI thought you were hiding Deku?\u201d Shouta narrowed his eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI was. But I\u2019m a kid? My analysis is good, I <em>know</em> that.\u201d He emphasized the last bit strangely, like it was something he had to remind himself of often. \u201cBut my steps for hiding myself basically depended on the professionals not being interested enough to ask, at least until I finished teaching myself hacking, which is a while away still. I just figured, um, that the phone number thing meant that you were interested, or would be soon?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta let that sink in for a moment, the words burrowing under his scarf and around his throat. The boy had expected to be caught be someone. \u201cBut you messaged me anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya studied the the pavement. He could have brought up that he\u2019d used a burner phone, instead, the boy shrugged before quietly saying, \u201cYeah, I did. You\u2019re <em>Eraserhead</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He could mean that Shouta was a better option, but there was something lacing the edge of Midoriya\u2019s words, something Shouta had never really heard in reference to himself. He heard it used for Present Mic thought, and Midnight.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He sighed again. \u201cIt\u2019s Aizawa, kid. Aizawa Shouta.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The hand let go, and for one sharp moment Shouta thought he\u2019d screwed something up rather badly.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya turned bright and watering eyes to him, red up to the tips of his ears. \u201cWe\u2019re here, A-Aizawa Sensei,\u201d Midoriya blurted out before running up a set of nearby stairs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta ruthlessly stamped down the flush of warmth sinking into his bones, but failed to succeed entirely when the stamp of his boots on the stairs had Midoriya, standing on the landing, straightening to the boy\u2019s full height.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Midoriyas lived on the second floor in a low apartment complex. They headed to a nondescript door about a third of the way down the building.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya took out a key from his pocket and glanced back at Shouta before opening the door. He\u2019d barely finished calling out when a warm voice from deeper inside the greeted him and continued talking. Shouta didn\u2019t doubt where the younger Midoriya had picked up the mumbling habit.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201c-and you\u2019ll never guess who came by the library tonight, Izu-baby! Mizu! It\u2019s been years, but apparently her family\u2019s moved back to town and one of the first things she did was come see if the bookclub was still open, isn\u2019t that sweet. I was in such as good mood that I stopped by for takeout, I got your favourite - oh. I don\u2019t think I got enough for three.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya Inko was a short, another trait she passed to her son, and fairly round woman who wielded kindness like both an air and a weapon. Her eyes were sharp as they took in Shouta, and he had no doubt that they clocked the way Izuku stood slightly in front of Shouta, shifting his feet in nervousness but not fear.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta stepped forward, parent-politeness a familiar hat after many teacher conferences.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya beat him to it. \u201cMom, this is-\u201c</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cEraserhead. Yes, dear, I\u2019m aware.\u201d There was a sparkle in her eyes that Shouta wouldn\u2019t trust, except it seemed to be directed at her son, whose ears were once again rather red.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cAizawa Shouta.\u201d He handed her his hero licence, which she took and studied carefully, to her credit.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cMidoriya Inko. Is Izuku in trouble?\u201d She asked as she handed the licence back.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cNot at all.\u201d Shouta watched as both Midoriyas relaxed, Izuku in the releasing of his shoulders and the drop of his bag, Inko in the lines around her eyes and mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta hummed. \u201cAs you seem to be aware,\u201d Izuku\u2019s face did something that only confirmed Shouta\u2019s suspicion, \u201cyour son has been consulting for me and several others for several months now.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Inko nodded, but said nothing, instead reaching over to pull her son into her side.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Well, Shouta had never been one for subtly. He handed her a stack of papers produced from one of his hidden pockets, which she robotically took without removing her eyes from Shouta\u2019s face. \u201cI want to make your son my official intern.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya, Deku, was practically vibrating, while his mother was stiller than ice.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWhy.\u201d Her voice was quiet but firm, more statement than question.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI want to train your son to be a hero,\u201d Shouta kept his answer equally simple, but quickly saw from her expression that it won\u2019t be quite enough. He opened his mouth to answer, to somehow summarize that her son was a genius with a core of kindness that heroics <em>needed,</em> that he was terrified about what could happen if villains learn of the boy\u2019s abilities without the kid being able to protect himself, that there were singe marks on the boy\u2019s jacket and which was <em>wrong, </em>but he stopped.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta turned, very slightly, to face Deku head on, knowing this was something that they probably should have discussed before (thought not on a damn rooftop) and the kid probably needed to hear.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta certainly had.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou\u2019ve saved my life, Deku, or at the very least, saved me from significant amounts of physical harm. You\u2019ve done the same for Detective Tsukauchi, who is not only an important colleague, but also a friend. You\u2019ve absolutely saved multiple civilian lives.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cDeku, I want to train you to be a hero not in spite of your lack of quirk, but because you already are a hero. I\u2019ll just be helping the world and the bureaucrats see what I already know.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya Izuku, to Shouta\u2019s complete lack of shock, burst into tears. Thankfully, this time there was a slightly less teary Midoriya Inko to act as much better comfort.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Inko, who to Izuku\u2019s clear surprise, immediately nodded. \u201cOf course. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku asked though his tears.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya Inko sniffed, cradling her son\u2019s freckled face in her hands. \u201cYou needed support, baby, to follow your dream, support you didn\u2019t have and I couldn\u2019t provide. But I\u2019m proud of how you didn\u2019t give up and worked as hard as you did while staying as safe as you could. If Aizawa is willing to spend the time to make you as safe as possible while following your dream, then of course you can work with him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta was pierced with eyes that put Nezu to shame as the small woman looked over her son\u2019s mop of hair. Shouta didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been so effectively threatened without anyone saying a word.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He nodded, trying hard to let none of his appreciation at the glare through the gesture.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Midoriya Inko released her son with a firm push towards what Shouta presumed was the kid\u2019s room to freshen up.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She faced Shouta, after a deep breath to get her own tears under control, and he braced himself for the words after all.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cNow, you\u2019d best call me Inko. We\u2019ll be seeing quite a lot of each other.\u201d Shouta blinked, somewhat surprised he didn\u2019t fight the woman as she used his inattention to gently shove him into a seat.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She returned with a plate and napkin which Shouta attempted to deflect. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to take up your time or your food.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cNonsense. We have details to go over and a schedule to draft. Not to mention, I demand family dinners.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWhat.\u201d Shouta pushed aside a strand of his black hair to stare into sparkling green eyes. He was pretty sure they were laughing at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou\u2019re too skinny.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He never got a chance to reply as the kid bounced in, saw Shouta with a plate, and brightened like the sun. \u201cAizawa Sensei is staying for dinner?!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cAbsolutely. And with some frequency.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta planned to protest. He planned to say that this was unprofessional. That they could set up a time to meet later. He planned to say that he didn\u2019t really do dinner, not like this.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He planned a lot of things, and they all fell apart under two sets of emerald eyes and warmth gentle like sunshine, but strong like it had glinted off glass.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cTsukauchi\u2019s skinnier then I am.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t strictly true, but Shouta was a big believer in deflecting. And throwing his colleagues under the bus for mocking him (Zashi cannot meet this family until Shouta is sure there won\u2019t be a flood of smiles and light and <em>noise</em>). \u201cHe hasn\u2019t gone a week without working overtime in four months.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Inko frowned, before looking at her son. \u201cThat nice Detective who's helping you?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The kid nodded frantically. \u201cDetective Tsukauchi is really cool! He\u2019s really clever about using his quirk and tries really hard to help everyone he possibly can.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWell then, he\u2019ll just have to come to dinner, too.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Izuku smiled with a far away look. \u201cTuesdays would work best. The Detective has a late start on Wednesday and Eraserhead has the night off patrol.\u201d He blushed when both adults looked at him and tried to duck into the kitchen to get the rest of the food. He wasn\u2019t in time to miss his mother giggling at him, or the hand Shouta threw out to ruffle green curls.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWhat the kid said.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">(Inko had enough takeout, and Shouta left fuller then he\u2019d been in weeks, with a stack of notebooks tucked under his arm and warmth that didn\u2019t burn behind his eyes.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It ended with a text. Well, several texts. And a picture.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Izuku was beaming in the photo, gesturing loudly with one hand waving in the air and the other pointing to a page in his Analysis Notebooks. There were no less than seven on the table, pushing a mostly finished bowl of katsudon to the side, and all were open to entries on heroes with mutant quirks.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tsukauchi, sleeves rolled up, was nodding while steadily devouring a plate of mochi. Inko was ruffling her son\u2019s hair as she cleared the table, bowl in hand and a small, star-bright smile on her lips.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta was grinning in the corner, a goblin of a selfie intruding on the family moment. Shouta knew Hizashi had a habit of literally turning around and walking away whenever confronted with the particular amount of teeth and eyes that went with it. Shouta didn\u2019t care. The expression was crucial for delivering his message.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aizawa sent a photo</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aizawa: <em>Finders Keepers.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aizawa: <em>I\u2019ll share if you help him with hacking. And graduating early</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aizawa: <em>Also destroying a middleschool. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nezu: <em>Intriguing.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Izuku flailed hardly a moment after Shouta received the Principal\u2019s response, launching the bowl at his elbow towards the ground. Aizawa barely heard Inko\u2019s praise of Tsukauchi\u2019s reflexes over Izuku\u2019s screech.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cOh my gosh, what the fuck, why did Principal Nezu just text me?! Is this real?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta grinned into his capture weapon, still with more teeth than might be considered normal, but also with more warmth than his coworkers would likely believe possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He shrugged, immediately drawing the kid\u2019s attention and Tsukauchi\u2019s suspicion. \u201cPretty sure it was in my contract to let the Rat know if I took a personal student. Something about an investment paying off.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It wouldn\u2019t be enough for most others, but Shouta watched green eyes narrow, flailing hands briefly settling down as the kid focused. He also watched awareness flare and the hands go wild again, nearly hitting his amused mother in the arm.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou mean Principal Nezu is my grand-Sensei?!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tsukauchi sighed, deeply, before ducking and accepting more Mochi from a giggling Inko.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Shouta just patted a flailing hand, watching as tumbling sunshine poured off the kid.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">His kid.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">(Shouta <em>wanted).</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>"
