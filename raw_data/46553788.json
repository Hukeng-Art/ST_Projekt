  "text": "<p>Danny has been in this new world for about a month and so far it's been pretty chill.</p>\n<p>As chill as a world chock full of super heroes and villains with bi-monthly attempts of world conquests and various fruitloops trying to kick start the apocalypse can be.</p>\n<p>Now he had no plans to join in, these guys got their shit covered and had fully planned to treat getting stranded in another universe while waiting for his family and friends to come pick him up as a extended vacation.</p>\n<p>Hey, even King's needed me time.</p>\n<p>And for the most part he could but his obsession kept acting up, telling him to join in. So when he did, it was minor stuff like stopping a mugging or helping with a evac while the heavy hitters did their thing.</p>\n<p>He also actively tracked them down solely to study their moves and techniques, as this was as close to a mentoring as he dared get to, relishing the quick and easy fights.</p>\n<p>Today was not a quick and easy fight day.</p>\n<p>He had been stalking/studying Captian Red Pantaloons (better known by the locals as Superman) for about two weeks now and this was the so far the only fight he was struggling with.</p>\n<p>Normally the dude could shrug off anything but today he was getting his butt kick by Vlad Masters: Bald Edition because dude had loaded his suit with what appeared to be ghost crystal meth that Superboxers seem to have an extreme allergic reaction to, and Danny decided he needed to actually step in before the red tighty whitey crusader died from anaphylaxis shock.</p>\n<p>The problem was, he had no desire to reveal his ghost side. Sure he could go in as Fenton, but that risked people finding him faster and he reeeeally did not want this world's brand of crazy following him around as he waited to go home.</p>\n<p>But he had to act and act soon, because the Mighty Bloomers was looking really sick now.</p>\n<p>He was about to bite the bullet and transform when he spotted a dollar store with a cartoony mask of the Crimson Panty Man.</p>\n<p>A feral grin split across his face as a <em>wonderful</em> idea popped into his head.</p>\n<p>Clark was close to collapsing and about ready to pass out in pain after being grazed by the heat seeking projectiles that had krytonite in them.</p>\n<p>He just had to last long enough for others to arrive, just last until--</p>\n<p>Movement appeared in the corner of his eye and he thought help had arrived. But Lex had stopped, just straight up stopped to stare in a incomprehensible manner at their new arrival.</p>\n<p>Keeping Lex still in view he turned enough to look.</p>\n<p>And promptly wondered if kryptonite caused hallucinations.</p>\n<p>There on the ledge of the nearby building was... a kid, maybe fifteen years old.... wearing a plastic cartoon version of his face that clearly came from a dollar store. With a really huge and tacky looking pompadour that was lopsided on his head, a piece of paper with a S visably taped to a baggy blue shirt, blue jeans with red boxers that clearly have the brand logo printed on them over the pants, and a red beach towel knotted around his neck.</p>\n<p>Clark was almost positive he had some kind of head trauma now.</p>\n<p>\"Halt evildoer!\" The teen yelled, in a tone that was a clearly meant to be a mimic of his own voice and just like the rest of him, a <em>very</em> poor imitation. For some reason the kid was speaking with a Quick Draw McGraw's El Kabong accent.</p>\n<p>\"In the name of Truth, Justice and a Better Tomorrow I will stop you!\"</p>\n<p>Clark didn't sound that cheesy when he said that, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Clark felt his heart drop and he lurched forward when the kid took a running dive off the building.</p>\n<p>And kept flying.</p>\n<p>In a <em>really</em> corny pose.</p>\n<p>That theory of kryptonite causing hallucinations was gaining traction in his mind.</p>\n<p>Clark then, too nauseous from the near hits and struggling to remain floating, watched the kid in the crappy outfit that might have taken three dollars and five minutes to put together proceed to kick Lex's ass using moves Clark perfected.</p>\n<p>Like perfectly executed moves Clark spent years mastering, and it made for a strange juxtaposition between the completely pathetic outfit and hammy performance the kid was doing and the sheer skill he was showing.</p>\n<p>Had the kid been studying him? And why had Clark never noticed him if he had?</p>\n<p>And then the kid used green laser beams from his eye holes to destroy the suit and kryptonite, but at the time Clark hadn't really considered the color difference as he was too busy cringing at the outfit and over the top acting (did it really look like he was wearing undies on the outside of his suit?! Good Lord, he was going to have to change the style of his suit after this!), the kid's mockery going strong even after beating Lex.</p>\n<p>The kid then guided him down to the ground, further away from the wrecked suit and Clark had a moment were he realized this kid's arms were practically noodles. How did he cause so much damage with zero muscle mass?</p>\n<p>Clark frowned as he gripped the kid in a move that could easily be mistaken for trying to keep his balance as they slowly landed, easily counting ribs.</p>\n<p>In fact, the boy was scrawny and short like he'd gone too many nights without a decent meal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He was going to drag this teen to his parents and have them feed him until he no longer looked like skeleton. Clark had two boys that ate like bottomless pits so he knew teens ate more, and metas tended towards needing a higher food intake (because the kid had to be a meta doing a terrible costume gimmick to hide his identity).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Random Citizen?\" The kid asked in his flamboyantly El Kabong inspired accent.</p>\n<p>He nodded, not trusting himself to speak (as a lot of what he wanted to say was a variation of \"Who the fuck are you?\" and \"Do you need a place to stay?\" and he had to swallow all the ways he wanted to say \"I know a guy that can speed run me into a adoption, how does the name Kent sound?\").\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid gave a exaggerated nod before doing another (cringeworthy) pose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Then I will leave you and this evildoers in the hands of the police. Now I must go. Cosplay Man: Superman Edition, awwwwaaaaaaaaaa--\" here he inhales deeply before continuing, \"--AAAAAAAaaaaaay!\"</p>\n<p>And with that he shot off into the sky, posing dramatically as he flew off into the sun. Clark couldn't go after him at the moment but instead kept track of his steady heart beat, forcing himself to stay still.</p>\n<p>He was going to have to go the the Fortress as soon as possible to begin the purging process before he tracked down his new ward. Nodding Clark then made the error of looking away to the police who were just as lost as he was, with Lex appearing to be unsure if he should be offended or amused. When he looked back the kid was gone, not even a heart beat to track him.</p>\n<p>Clark had a suspicion this would not be the last time they saw 'Cosplay Man'.</p>\n<p>Also, as soon as he could see straight he was calling Bruce to let him know he called dibs.</p>\n<p>Danny had no idea how he did not break out laughing, using the ring of rage to shortcut across the state. He had been so nervous, his heart hammering in his chest but as soon as he saw the looks of confusion and disbelief it had been all he could do not to break character.</p>\n<p>Man, that turned out way better then he thought!</p>\n<p>But Danny decided it was probably time to leave as he didn't want to give Monsieur Unmentionables a reason to track him down for the very badly done copy infringement.</p>\n<p>He pulled out his little map that he had cities with heroes in them circled, closed his eyes and randomly pointed to a spot. Cracking a eye open he nodded at the nearest hero lived city his finger had been by.</p>\n<p>Guess Star City, Connecticut was his next stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Star City wasn't bad, like a less bright version of Metropolis whose main hero was a Robin Hood rip off. Still leagues better in terms of costume then the Mighty Red Panty-Man, but he gets negative points for unoriginality.</p>\n<p>Still, he followed the archer around for sixteen days, taking notes because the man was 'normal' while fighting and you never know when you need to fight someone with a bow and arrow.</p>\n<p>He had even been experimenting with a bow he constructed out of ecto. It took him eight days but he could now direct any arrow he infused with ecto to move anyway he wanted them to, and could make them sharp enough to cut through steel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He in fact expiramented a lot, discovering ways to weaponize, well, weapons.</p>\n<p>And weaponize not-weapons, but that was still a bit of a trial and error.</p>\n<p>He still studied Princess Merida, finding him to be kinda a asshole but stuck around because despite being a jerk he was reeeeally good at his craft.</p>\n<p>Which led to today.</p>\n<p>The poor green bean of the city was in a tight spot against another archer. Danny was unsure if he should intervene but after watching Blonde and Green Hawkeye take a arrow to the knee (ha) he decided he had to.</p>\n<p>Much like with Super Bloomers, he ran to the nearest dollar store which happened to be near a children's store and a thrift shop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later he rushed out of the last building, already infusing his 'weapons' with ecto.</p>\n<p>\"Halt evildoer!\"</p>\n<p>Oliver was not having a good day.</p>\n<p>He'd fallen face first out of bed, walked into a wall, got into an argument with Roy and missed breakfast.</p>\n<p>And now he was paralyzed thanks to a arrow coated in a paralyzing agent in his leg, courtesy of Merlyn who was advancing towards him with a friendly smile that promised he was in for a rough time.</p>\n<p>Could this get any worse?</p>\n<p>\"Halt evildoer!\" A young voice sounded out, a haughty tone like the kid was trying to sound swarmy and going over the top to achieve it.</p>\n<p>Merlyn had turned from him, looking ready to address the new person when he froze, eyes widening and smiling dropping as he nonverbally mouthed \"What the fuck.\"</p>\n<p>Oliver, with effort, turned his head to see what caused the man to look so baffled.</p>\n<p>And promptly wondered if the arrow in his leg was not just coated in a paralyzing agent but also a hallucination one as well.</p>\n<p>There, standing on top of a abandoned car was... a teen dressed in a puke green baggy green hoodie that had to be three sizes too big... skin toned pantyhose over his jeans, bedazzled uggs, a ugly Big Bird yellow hat complete with the puppets eyes and beak, a neon stripe of clothes that had eye holes cut out of them, Barbie pink with green glittery bow with My Little Pony theme quiver holding suction cup plastic arrows. And to complete this look, a badly doodled green mustache and goatee that looked like it had been inspired by Snidely Whiplash.</p>\n<p>It took the archer a minute to realize that was suppose to be <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>Oliver tried to recall a moment before now where he felt this offended over someone else's outfit and came up blank. If he could move more then his head he would have dragged the boy to the nearest changing room and order him to take it off.</p>\n<p>The kid held up his plastic glittery bow (why did a Barbie pink bow have vibrant green glitter?), pointing one of those suction cupped arrows at Merlyn, something green was oozing in the cup.</p>\n<p>\"You have failed this city, so I will defend it!\" The teen called out, and Oliver fought to move, to stop this idiot before he got killed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Merlyn finally recovered, giving the boy a very unimpressed look. \"Nice outfit, did you raid a dumpster for it?\"</p>\n<p>The kid fired, Merlyn holding his arm up to block it from hitting his face, looking deeply apathetic at where it landed on his elbow then back at the kid who had knocked another.</p>\n<p>Three more suction cups landed near where the first one had, covering the elbow. A fourth one handed on his exposed wrist before Merlyn sighed, grabbing the one on his wrist.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't try removing that if I were you, fiend.\" The kid warned in a pompous manner.</p>\n<p>\"Kid, run along before I-- <em>AAARGH</em>!\"</p>\n<p>Oliver jolted at the scream of pain, eyes zeroing in on the suction cup Merlyn dropped as he clutched his wrist.</p>\n<p>There, clear as daylight, was <em>skin</em> clinging to the suction cup.</p>\n<p>What the <em>fuck</em> did that kid put on that thing, <em>industrial strength</em> adhesive?!</p>\n<p>Three more suction cupped arrows struck, this time on Merlyn's other elbow and the master archer had to dive in order to avoid the fourth and fifth ones, but the kid was fast and kicked out the back of his knee, the bejeweled footwear loosing shinies with the hit.</p>\n<p>Merlyn swung his bow for the bootlegged Green Arrow head but the boy was already putting space between them, diving behind a car.</p>\n<p>Merlyn was struggling to aim with the glued arrows, and Oliver wondered if the kid had aimed for the elbows and wrist because it hindering his joints and would make it very hard for Merlyn to strike back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If that had been why he went for the joints then maybe the hideous outfit had been cobbled together in order to deliberately drop Merlyn's guard, as no one would have taken him seriously in that get up.</p>\n<p>Smart but even injured and limited in his movements Merlyn was dangerous.</p>\n<p>A game of cat and mouse took place, or perhaps it was whack a mole, Merlyn growing clearly angrier with each failure to land a hit on the scrawny teen in pantyhose and Big Bird beanie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A kid that obviously had learned his skills via observation and appeared self taught. He clearly did not have expirence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he more then made up for it by being fast, tricky and having good aim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0The hero had barely got to his feet, gritting his teeth as the paralyzer was still going strong, but he managed to apply pressure to his leg where the arrow still was sticking out of, stopping the blood flow.</p>\n<p>Looking back up, he was both baffled yet impressed that the kid somehow managed to dodge all of Merlyn's blows, though that may have partly been because both of Merlyn's elbow joints were covered now making it almost impossible to use the bow.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Those can't be actual toys</em>, Oliver thought as another of Rip-off Green Arrow's suction cup arrows found skin. <em>There is no way, Merlyn would have at least yanked the plastic shaft off if he couldn't get the cup to go. Which meant those had to be modified somehow. Either way, this kid is winning.</em></p>\n<p>Which just furthered Oliver's belief that the kid utilized a shitty costume in order to not be taken seriously at all because he could not think of any other reason Merlyn would have taken such a beaten unless he had complete written the kid off as harmless. If he lives through this Oliver was going give him pointers.</p>\n<p>Then the kid leaped up (straight up in a move those chicken legs should <em>not</em> have the power to perform) letting go of the string as he fired-- <em>was that a actual plunger?!</em></p>\n<p>He got to see the look of sheer disbelief on Merlyn's face before the plunger hit him square in the chest, sending him flying back ten feet before hitting the ground. The man wheezed and Oliver winced at the sound. If he didn't have a broken bone from that he'd be very surprised.</p>\n<p>A sudden volley of kid-toy arrows rained, landing all over Merlyn's arms and still covered legs, clustered around the elbow, knees, ankles and wrists. Everything from the waist down might be easier to come off since they were stuck to his pants but he'd still have to work to get it off, while the only skin not covered was from the neck up.</p>\n<p>How the actual hell did that kid shoot that many arrows in under fifteen seconds?! There had to be twenty!</p>\n<p>The kid rushed forward, pointing another plunger at the archer. The sight of that thing pointed at his face caused Merlyn to go abnormally still (not that Oliver could blame him, that thing looked like it had been used before!).</p>\n<p>\"Surrender.\" The kid ordered, not wavering.</p>\n<p>Merlyn, humiliated and probably very worried that the plunger was dipped in the same stuff the little ones were, very sensibly did as he was told.</p>\n<p>The police arrived a few minutes later, the kid performing first aide on his leg with a distressing amount of skill that spoke of expirence as he explained that he called the cops before getting involved.</p>\n<p>\"Will you be alright, Random Citizen?\" The kid asked, still in the badly done snotty voice.</p>\n<p>Oliver snorted, easing himself against a police car. \"Yeah, I will be. Where'd you learn to shoot a bow? You got skill.\"</p>\n<p>\"I spent over two weeks following you around. That is the extent of my training.\" The pompous sounding teen replied, standing in a stereotypical Robin Hood pose.</p>\n<p>Oliver nearly fell over. \"Two weeks!? That was the result of <em>two weeks</em>?\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed it 'twas. Oh that reminds me.\" The kid about faced, marching to where Merlyn was handcuffed.</p>\n<p>He took out a bottle from the baggy hoodie and started pouring on the still stuck on arrows. They fell after ten seconds, leaving the archer with red marked but whole skin.</p>\n<p>\"No hard feelings. It's just I knew I'd never beat you unless you thought I was just a incredibly dumb kid in a crappy cosplay. If you <em>had</em> taken me even remotely serious, we both know I'd be a smear on a wall.\" The teen told him, not using the conceited tone but what Oliver suspected was his real voice.</p>\n<p>Merlyn, who had been glaring until this moment, gave a searching look. Finally he huffed a self-reproachful laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Shame on me for falling for it. No hard feelings, kid.\"</p>\n<p>Merlyn looked sincere but Oliver was going to keep an eye on him. Just in case he does hold a grudge.</p>\n<p>Or worse, recruit the kid.</p>\n<p>The kid returned to him, swaggering like a douchebag and making Oliver cringe at the sight of those sheer pantyhose. Thank god he was wearing his jeans under it.</p>\n<p>Though it was a toss up whether the pantyhose offended him worse then the Big Bird beanie. His hair did not look like a googly eyed bird nest!</p>\n<p>The kid bent down, picking up one of Oliver's very real arrows, then another before chucking it hard into the air, rapidly shooting it clean in half with the other one he grabbed.</p>\n<p>As in he divided the damn thing right down the middle, the second arrow finally stopping when it got stuck under the metal head of the first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The police cheered as Merlyn looked speculative at the kid, like finding rare diamond among sewage.</p>\n<p>\"Now I must be off. Cosplay Man: Green Arrow Edition, <em>awaaaaaaay</em>!\"</p>\n<p>The kid's voice cracked on the last word, and he pranced-- <em>literally pranced</em>-- off and before Oliver could tell him to stop, the kid dived behind the building and out of sight.</p>\n<p>... okay, <em>yeah</em>. Oliver was taking this kid on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Even if it was only to make sure he had the basics and didn't piss more people off. He could convince Roy to help him, he'd absolutely would go along if he tells him the kid made a deadly enemy and Oliver was only training him for self defense.</p>\n<p>... he wondered if Connor and Dinah would be okay with a new family member. Providing Roy didn't try adopting him first.</p>\n<p>Danny turned invisible the second he was out of sight, fighting back his giggles and flying as fast as he could.</p>\n<p>That had turned out soooo much better! And <em>holy</em> <em>crap baskets</em>, he was so glad that whiskered dude didn't take him seriously. Fucker was scary and clearly on par with Green Goatee and would have absolutely mopped the floor with him.</p>\n<p>Not wanting scary mofo going after him for a stupid grudge, Danny had removed the toys clamping to his skin as an appeasement, feeling light when he could feel the dude's sincerity over not having hard feelings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus he didn't want anyone realizing what he used to keep the cups sticking to him, using nail polish remover so no one would realize he was just making it dissipate.</p>\n<p>He removed the ectoplasm from his temporary weapons, the green glimmers on the Barbie bow disappearing completely as he reabsorbed it befire finally burning his get up.</p>\n<p>Just because he took all the ectoplasm didn't mean he got it all. This way at least he could be sure no one got ahold of it.</p>\n<p>Danny pulled out his map, randomly selecting another place to visit.</p>\n<p>Cracking his eye open, he frowned at the distance but shrugged deciding to follow his trusty map even though there were closer heroes to visit as he was on vacation.</p>\n<p>Nodding he used the ring of rage to shorten the trip, smiling a bit too widely.</p>\n<p>\"Coast City, California! Here we come!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coast City was not a bad place, very hot and sunny, gorgeous beaches.</p>\n<p>It's resident hero though was kinda a jerk. Not a bad person, just a bit of a ass nugget in terms of people skills and seemed to have a big head due to how OP he can be.</p>\n<p>Not that Danny was going to judge (too much), he was pretty sure a lot of that attitude was in fact earned through trial by fire if even half of what he heard about the Olive Lightbulb was true.</p>\n<p>Still, Danny studied and followed him around for nearly three weeks and was all the better for it.</p>\n<p>Because this dude could create so much shit with that ring of his. Like Danny was serious impressed by some of those constructs he made!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Danny wasn't sure what the source of those ring powers were but he could feel a sort of ambience in the power as he created, a strange sense of wanting to accomplish something. So he was pretty sure the ring exuded confidence boost or something, which might explain why it's wearer was so secure in his... everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kinda wishes he could ask the Lime Beacon for pointers on constructs but Danny made due.</p>\n<p>The ghost king had been practicing on his own creations, and while they were very different from the Grassy Gaslight's own methods he was making progress!</p>\n<p>Danny might have followed the guy around for a few more weeks had the Verdant Lamp not run into a yellow and purple version of the lantern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>... whose ring for some reason was giving Danny a serious case of the munchies.</p>\n<p>Danny almost laughed at that. A powerful ring that got people high? No wonder that guy was so over the top, he was probably stoned out of his gourd and very addicted to his bong ring!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, yellow dude seemed to have trapped green dude who was struggling to get out of it. And maybe high as kite guy was going on about destroying him so Danny decided it was about time he intervened.</p>\n<p>Teleporting to the nearest thrift shop he grabbed everything quickly and with practice ease got his get up ready.</p>\n<p>He stopped only long enough to grab something very important from a candy shop. After all, what lantern didn't have a ring?</p>\n<p>Hal gritted his teeth, pulling all of his willpower within himself as Sinestro prattled on, ignoring the yellow lantern's mockery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His ring was low on power and he had been taken unaware. He had just enough time to call for Guy and John before he was captured.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Now he had to keep Sinestro talking, stall him just long enough for back up to arrive.</p>\n<p>He needed time, just a little bit more--</p>\n<p>\"Like, halt evildoer!\" A very stereotypical Californian surfer dude voice called out, drawing both his and Sinestro's attention.</p>\n<p>And all of Hal's concentration cease to be as he stared in confusion at the new arrival.</p>\n<p>A kid, maybe fifteen at most floated a few feet above them. He was wearing pit viper sunglasses, a green tank top over a white tee-shirt with the Green Lantern symbol doodled messily on the tank top in sharpee, green parachute/harem pants with green and white camo prints on it, rain boots with frogs on them, opera gloves and... was that a ring pop?</p>\n<p>\"In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's light. Bruh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal was both glad and disturbed when he and Sinestro shared a 'Are you seeing this shit?' look.</p>\n<p>After a moment Sinestro moved towards the poorly dressed lad.</p>\n<p>\"Well then 'Green Lantern', let's see you handle this!\" Sinestro said maliciously, a construct of a monstrous creature rushing the teen.</p>\n<p>Hal's heart was in his throat, cursing himself for not telling the boy to run and trying to create a barrier--</p>\n<p>A green construct came into being, right before the fear beast made contact.</p>\n<p>\"Yo, evil pothead. You're creations won't, like, work against me.\" The kid informed, arms sprouting from the barrier and trapping the thrashing beast.</p>\n<p>\"Oh? We'll see about that!\" Sinestro snarled, sending darts at the kid who skillfully dodged them all, trapping each one in a green bubble.</p>\n<p>Hal watched, gobsmacked as this kid fought Sinestro on even ground. Despite his abysmally awful outfit, he moved like a pro in the air but Hal noticed the kid wasn't used to creating things on the fly, like it was a power he only recently acquired.</p>\n<p>Meaning the kid was a <em>real</em> lantern.</p>\n<p>He hadn't heard of any new members, and he knew all the Earth ones were accounted for so where did this kid get one?</p>\n<p>Unless the kid was <em>reeeeeally</em> new. Like, just acquired this brand new power in the last few <em>weeks\u00a0</em>new.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It was the only thing that made sense, the kid must have just acquired the lantern power and was still figuring it out, hence the inexperience with creating things. The real ring must be under the pop ring, or maybe the gloves? It was a good idea if he was worried about losing his ring.</p>\n<p>Another look at the kid's outfit made Hal cringe. Why was he dressed like that? The outfit was just so crappy! Why make his outfit look so... cheap? Was it some kind of weird statement?</p>\n<p>Hal was actually very offended the kid constructed the outfit to look like that. He was going to have a talk about that with the kid.</p>\n<p>The kid who was now kicking Sinestro's ass.</p>\n<p>And he meant that <em>literally</em>.</p>\n<p>He just kicked him in the ass, hard enough Sinestro went flying into a building.</p>\n<p>He was going to have to explain to the kid why they shouldn't deliberately piss off powerful people, wasn't he? And not cause property damage, but the kid had winced at the impact so he probably knew not to do that.</p>\n<p>But it did weaken his binding, allowing Hal to break free.</p>\n<p>Sinestro pulled himself free, looking livid and before Hal could stop him the yellow lantern sent a concentrated blast at the boy.</p>\n<p>The kid, seeing the blast coming, proceeded nonchalantly dodge it.</p>\n<p>But not before biting the blast as it shot passed, causing it to dissipate.</p>\n<p>There was silence, only broken by the chewing noises the kid made followed by a impressive belch.</p>\n<p>What the <em>ever</em> loving <em>fuck</em> did he just <em>witness</em>?</p>\n<p>\"Oh my homeworld.\" Sinestro rasped,and Hal watched as his face paled into a very ugly puce. \"You're a ecto-entity!\"</p>\n<p>The kid looked like he was going to protest but stopped, thought about it and then nodded with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\"No. Nope. Not happening. I'm out! Goodbye!\" And with that Sinestro opened a portal and just left.</p>\n<p>The kid (<em>was he a kid if he could cause Sinestro to flee like that?</em>) flew over to him.</p>\n<p>\"Are you all right, Random Citizen?\"</p>\n<p>Hal snorted. Yeah, he had to be a kid with that much sass.</p>\n<p>\"Tired and drained, but fine. Why did he call you an ecto-entity?\" And was Hal going to have to contact another world in order to train this kid?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Ecto-entity's are the residents from the Infinte Realm.\" The kid shrugged, dropping the surfer accent.</p>\n<p>Hal almost wheezed. He heard of that place, it was considered the seams of the universe! It was one of the only places the lanterns (regardless of color) would not get involved in because the place drains the lanterns powers!</p>\n<p>He even heard they could eat the rings powers, which the kid just proved!</p>\n<p>\u00a0The kid went on before he could demand answers. \"Well, I'm only halfa one. Other half is still human.\"</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hal was absolutely betting on a sob backstory, one with the kid maybe struggling with being a child of two worlds. God damn it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh? How your parents handle that?\" Because maybe the kid's human parent had unknowingly bedded a interdimensional being? Or maybe it was a love match?</p>\n<p>\"Well, they kept trying to hunt me and there was a couple of times they almost vivisected me... that was admittably terrifying, but we did talked it out and they really hadn't meant to rip <em>me</em> apart molecule by molecule!\"</p>\n<p>\"They tried to vivisect you?!\" Hal screeched, wondering what kind of parents would do that. And ' molecule by molecule'? <em>That</em> sounded like something the kid was repeating, quite possibly something he had heard many times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Well, they are human and dedicated their lives to studying ecto-people so it wasn't like it came out of no where. And they never succeeded!\"</p>\n<p>\"But-but I thought you were half-ecto?\" Was that the right terminology? And where did his deranged and possibly murderous parents live?</p>\n<p>Hal just wants to talk.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it just sorta happened. I mean fruitloop makes it sound like I was fated for greatness and to dominate the universe but nobody listened to that crazy pants.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fruitloop?\" He said faintly, hoping against hope the kid was exaggerating.</p>\n<p>Sinestro's reaction made him think otherwise.</p>\n<p>\"He's a ecto-entity like me. Wants to murder my dad, marry my mom who apparently dated him for all of six hours before dumping his ass back when she was in college and make me his evil heir. Absolute psycho.\" He kid answers, talking like he was discussing the weather rather then the absolutely disturbing deluge he just spilled.</p>\n<p>\"W-why did you eat Yellow Lantern's construct? It was fueled by fear, wouldn't that effect you?\" He whispered, wondering how he was still floating with this barrage of horror the kid seemed to be unwittingly dumping on him.</p>\n<p>\"What, his power source is fear?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hal gave a jerky nod and the kid had a light bulb moment.</p>\n<p>\"So that's why I got the munchies! I thought his ring was like some kind of supernatural bong or something!\"</p>\n<p>The kid took pity on Hal when he mouthed 'supernatural bong?'.</p>\n<p>\"Ecto-entities can feed off of emotions, especially emotions that they have a strong connection to. Like this absolute hard ass prison Warden--\" <em>Why did this child know a prisons warden?</em>! \"-- feeds off of power and rules, or this kid I know feeds off of immaturity, a girl I dated once feeds off of adoration, and so forth. Common emotions though has different effects, like your sad? Going to cause so much empathy. You mad? You might suddenly find yourself super protective.\"</p>\n<p>Hal nodded, wondering if the kid was mad a lot and that was why he had intervened.</p>\n<p>\"Fear is, like, the marijuana of the Infinte Realms. Well, not quite. We got people back home who exudes real shit your pants type fears and can trap you in your nightmares, but for the most part? It's ghost weed.\"</p>\n<p>Hal's brain short circuits. It takes a little while to restart it from finding out this <em>child's species can eat fear and get high off it.</em></p>\n<p>\"It's... pot? Fear is freaking pot to your people?! Wait, does that mean your stoned right now?\"</p>\n<p>The kid (again, can't be older then <em>fifteen</em>) made a humming noise, sucking on that damn ring pop before speaking. \"Huh. I might be. Just a tiny bit though.\"</p>\n<p>Hal took a deep calming breath as he mentally put everything he heard into a working report file.</p>\n<p>He was just rescued by a new lantern who is the half-human offspring of what appears to be a deranged and powerful ecto-entity bent on world(s) domination. Relationship is bad, so much the kid won't even refer to him by any family titles, or even acknowledge their relation.</p>\n<p>He was raised by his mother and step-father who hunts ecto-entites, including the boy himself. Did not appear to see anything was wrong with his parents <em>hunting</em> and <em>fuckin</em>' trying to <em>vivisect</em> him.</p>\n<p>Kid also can get high off fear because of his species, which suddenly explain the kid's attair if fear only makes him high (<em>and dear god, did this mean he had to figure out how to get a half human off a drug that is a natural human emotion?!</em>).</p>\n<p>The good news though is Sinestro probably won't be causing trouble for a while out of fear the kid will eat his ring or something.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, man? Are you okay? You're looking a little green.\" The kid had the audacity to pun him, but Hal could hear the genuine concern behind the words.</p>\n<p>He took another fortifying breath.</p>\n<p>Okay. <em>Okay</em>, <em><strong>OKAY</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Looks like Hal was going to be taking this kid on now. Maybe even take custody of him so his ecto-hunting 'parents' can't hurt him. And figure out a way to keep his evil bio-dad from coming near his new ward.</p>\n<p>And figure out how the hell he can keep the kid from metaphorically snorting his enemies fears.</p>\n<p>\"Oh I'm fine.\" he lied, just as two portals opened near them and John and Guy flew out.</p>\n<p>\"Ha- Sir! We came as soon as we could-- why the <em>fuck</em> is that kid wearing harem pants?\" Guy sputtered, both he and John giving the kid the same look he no doubt had at seeing the kid's get up.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, that's because I'm Cosplay Man.\" The kid chirped, going back to that cheesy surfer dude accent.</p>\n<p>Cosplay Man? Why the <em>hell</em> did he pick Cosplay Man as his hero name?</p>\n<p>\"Like, obviously I'm dressed as him.\" The brat said cheerfully, pointing at him, finishing it by sucking on his ring in his mouth and loudly popping it.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse me?!\" Hal yelled, looking appalled. <em>That</em> was suppose to be <em>him</em>?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid nodded, looking absolutely pleased by his reaction.</p>\n<p>\"Welp my dudes, my work is done here so take care of yourselves. Cosplay Man: Green Lantern Edition, aaaaaawwwwwaaaay. Bruh.\"</p>\n<p>And with that a portal opened behind the kid, disappearing as soon as he stepped through.</p>\n<p>\"... Hal. What the hell just happened.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our newest member. Obviously.\" Hal then explained what happened, his theories on the kid's background and how they clearly needed to get him out of that toxic environment before something worse happens.</p>\n<p>\"So we got a new member, a actual child who may have terrible powers even before he put the ring on whose family is -- or was-- hunting him. Oh, and he's the Yellow Lantern corps worst nightmare because he can eat their powers, albeit at the cost of turning him into a stoner.\" John summarized, looking like this was the weirdest thing he's ever heard.</p>\n<p><em>Try living through it</em>, Hal mentally replied.</p>\n<p>\"And you let this kid, knowing he was tripping balls, wander off.\" That was a very judgemental tone John was giving him.</p>\n<p>\"And the kid's got a sense humor, because he decided to dress up in an absolute mockery of anything that looks like a presentable suit.\" Guy chimed in, looking incredibly amused. \"You should be honored, Hal! You inspired that train wreck he was wearing!\"</p>\n<p>John grinned at that, chuckling with Guy. \"Our Hal Jordan, the man who inspired the next generations poor fashion choices!\"</p>\n<p>Hal grimaced in the face of his fellow lanterns clear amusement. He looked nothing like that! His suit was clearly superior!</p>\n<p>He was also pretty damn sure those knuckleheads were never going to let him hear the end of it. Assholes.</p>\n<p>\"We'll need to look into more about the ecto-entites, make sure his parents are the exception rather then the norm. We also need to find him and set up a training regiment. He knew how to fly so I can only assume it's a trait from his non-human side but was clearly not used to creating anything.\"</p>\n<p>\"... I call dibs on training Cosplay Man!\"</p>\n<p>Hal whipped around to Guy, glaring a him. \"Like <em>hell</em> you are! I met him first so I get dibs!\"</p>\n<p>\"You're clearly going to pull a Batman on him so I should be able to train him.\"</p>\n<p>The duo bickering while John watched, shaking his head at their antics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Danny had left the city post haste, having bought a enough snacks to feed a army as he sat in the baggage car of a train leaving Coast City he was definitely not suppose to be in but since he had accidently opened a portal inside a wall he felt it was best to not try the ring of rage at the moment.</p>\n<p>It took him hours to finally not feel high, deciding the trip had been surprisingly fun and he learned a lot.</p>\n<p>He scrolled through his brick of a phone before finally taking out his map.</p>\n<p>He nodded at his new destination and hopes Central City, Missouri didn't have villians that \u00a0used ghost weed as a weapon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>\"'Okay'? Just like that?\" Danny asked, feeling baffled.</p>\n<p>\"Just like that.\" The extra-dimensional source of dark matter energy confirmed cheerfully, which was weird to see as they had taken the form of Clockwork in order to communicate with him.</p>\n<p>\"Huh, didn't think you'd just up and agree to it.\"</p>\n<p>He really hadn't when he went to talk to the being called the Speed Force. He hadn't even been sure they were sentient or sapient but it felt rude not to at least try and communicate with the source that powered the speedsters in this universe.</p>\n<p>He had been following the Flash (a name that made him giggle nonstop the first time he heard it) for two days when he hit a snag in his study of man.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The dude was too fast for Danny to mimic his style or moves. He was almost too fast for Danny to follow and the only reason he could was because of the faint time deviations the man unknowingly left behind. Danny had trained enough with Clockwork to feel those without meaning to, allowing him to follow even as the man literally left him in the dust.</p>\n<p>He ended up spying and listening to the man in hopes of finding something that might help when he mentioned the Speed Force.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had followed him to the Tower (Danny might have geeked out like crazy at being in space) and after memorizing the Flash's password snuck into the computers to look it up. Invisibility had its perks and if he did it after Flash had used it most people would assume he forgot to turn it off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0(Danny felt bad about doing that because Super Bloomers scolded him on leaving himself logged in. He promised he'd make it up to the Flash)</p>\n<p>(Also, The Mighty Boxers was no more. Apparently the Man of Steel-Thongs finally got a clue and his outfit no longer had underwear on the outside. Glad Danny could shame him into changing his ways)</p>\n<p>He quickly learned the Speed Force was a power source outside of the multiverse... which meant it was located in the Infinte Realms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Danny decided to take a break from hero studying to find the source, unsure if it had a mind if it's own (Danny was of the belief that until proven otherwise, assume all things that can give others powers was either a machine or a being. If the former, find the creator, if the latter make sure you have food on hand) and was not really surprised to find that the Speed Force was a Ancient, a Ghost of Traversing that might have been created during the big bang.</p>\n<p>(And if he got directions from a sticky note that appeared on his shirt that also told him to enjoy his vacation and not worry about his home dimension, well it was nice to know his family and friends were safe and handling his impromptu R&amp;R rather nicely)</p>\n<p>Speed Force didn't really have a form and tended to take the form of people their visitors knew, which was kinda weird as Danny got the impression Speed Force was Clockwork's amicable ex since Speed Force kept referring to his mentor as \"My sweet mistake I'd <em>do</em> over <em>again</em>.\"</p>\n<p>But he was getting off track.</p>\n<p>He had sought them out with the gift of greasy fast food and asked for temporary use of their gift so he could better learn the speedster styles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Physically they were normal and did not possess super strength or abilities that could qualify as metas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But they were the closest thing Danny has seen in their home world to being liminals, with speed that had allowed for super human reflexes, violate certain laws of physics, time manipulation/travel (which was just another tic in the \"SF was CW's ex/off and on again lover\") and of course speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Danny didn't need to learn it but he was enjoying the Flash's company even though the guy was unaware he was being stalked and wanted to learn more.</p>\n<p>Hence the bribe of fast food and company, though Danny had been surprised the being just agreed without him even trying to convince them.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I've been watching you and I have to say it's been <em>most</em> entertaining, I can totes see why Clocky thinks so highly of you. And you'll be studying my speedsters and they get into all <em>sorts</em> of <em>trouble. S</em>o best have Cosplay Man be able to keep up with them while he gets them out of trouble.\" The entity tittered before getting serious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mind you, you'll only be able to do it as long as you are in character. Break character and you can no longer use it.\" Clockwork's face smiled in a manner that could almost be called sinister.</p>\n<p>\"And I'll take it back once your little sojourn in that dimension is over. Clocky would be so cross with me if I let you keep it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fair enough, I am totally okay with not gaining another permanent power. Still can't keep up with the ones I have.\"</p>\n<p>\"And I expect you to visit me <em>more</em> in the future, little king. I get <em>so</em> <em>lonely</em> on my travels.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll see if I can drag Clockwork with me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd adore <em>that</em>.\" Speed Force purred, looking delighted at the potential reunion.</p>\n<p>And that was how Danny got to be a temporary speedster.</p>\n<p>It took him days to figure out how not to crash into things, especially when he suddenly stopped being in character.</p>\n<p>Going from a bazillion-yellion-quadtrion miles a minute to negative zero had left him with destroyed sneakers and slamming into a semi at mach speed... which ended up looking like something out of a looney toons cartoon as he had to be pried out of the side of the semi truck by the white faced and terrified man who had dug him out of the two inch deep perfect impression he left in it.</p>\n<p>But once he figured that out he studied the Flash in earnest, practically vibrating as he could now keep up and study the Crimson Flasher with no limitations.</p>\n<p>Though he got the impression the Flash could sense him, or at least knew he was being followed. A side effect of being touched by Speed Force? Either way the dude has looked paranoid during the time Danny has been following him.</p>\n<p>Maybe he shouldn't have left snacks for the guy to find.</p>\n<p>He followed him the longest, at a whopping five weeks (four of which he had super speed) before he decided it was time to seek out another hero.</p>\n<p>So of course that was the day the Flash got his leg broken by a Water Tribe knock off.</p>\n<p>Commandant Coolant was talking at the speedster but Danny wasn't paying him any attention as he mentally put himself in character, rushing to the nearest thrift shop with a slight detour to a food stand while also calling the police.</p>\n<p>After all, Speed Force said he had to stay in character... but never said the characterization had to be <em>accurate</em>.</p>\n<p>Or even the Flash's <em>actual</em> personality. Just as long as he did not break it from first to last use of the force.</p>\n<p>Speed Force had laughed at his loopholes abusing.</p>\n<p>Barry was tired. And in pain, but mostly tired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shouldn't be, he was getting plenty of sleep. But for over a month he felt... watched.</p>\n<p>He knew he wasn't, he had searched his surroundings thoroughly but it didn't stop the sensation that someone was nearby.</p>\n<p><em>Watching</em> him.</p>\n<p><em>Studying</em> him.</p>\n<p>He swears at times he could see someone-- or something-- out of the corner of his eyes but no matter how fast he looked there was nothing there.</p>\n<p>And if that was it, he'd assume it was just stress getting to him.</p>\n<p>But then he started finding food in places he had literally just been in, addressed to him usually with some kind of joke or pun attached to it. At first he thought he thought it was Wally but his nephew insisted it wasn't.</p>\n<p>(Once he had grabbed a plate of cookies addressed to him, intent on testing it. He had looked away for a fraction of a millisecond and found a second plate where the first one had just been. He threw both out and vigorously searched the place)</p>\n<p>No matter how much he searched, how much he tested, he could not find anyone or anything out of place.</p>\n<p>He was ready to ask for help with a possible teleporter that was hopefully only trying to feed and not poison him when Captian Cold caught him by surprise and broke his left leg.</p>\n<p>The men with him took control of the area fast, having taken advantage of his lack of focus.</p>\n<p>Barry grit his teeth, mentally mathing just how far he could get on a broken leg--</p>\n<p>\"HMNF EVVL'OWWR!\" A shockingly loud muffle yelled, drawing mens attention.</p>\n<p>\"What the <em>fuck</em> is that kid wearing?\" One of Cold's men whispered, just loud enough for Barry to decide to take a second to look.</p>\n<p>He stared for a solid <em>ten seconds</em>, wondering if the pain was making him see shit.</p>\n<p>The kid, maybe fifteen... was wearing red and green plaid Urkel pants, a bright red (just a few shades off from becoming hot pink) parka with the hood pulled so close he could only see a bandana with eye holes, yellow electrical tape lines on his arms and legs, a ugly mostly dead garland with two random yellow feathers stuck in it was strapped over the hood, tie-dyed yellowish crocs, and... why was there a random banana duck tapped to his chest?</p>\n<p>\"AH VA PHFEST MEM AHVEV!\" The kid shouted, voice and words thoroughly muffled by the tightly shut hoodie.</p>\n<p>Barry was only a tiny bit concerned that Cold and his men were equally as confused by this kid as he was, mostly he was relieved as this meant he wasn't drugged or suffering some kind of mental issue.</p>\n<p>It did mean there was a freaking kid in danger and he was down a leg (ha).</p>\n<p>Before anyone (and he did mean <em>anyone</em>) could react the kid moved.</p>\n<p>Cold was the first taken out, the man making a noise that one could only make when a knee had been dug right into your gut at Mach 1, sending him flying backwards.</p>\n<p>Then the kid systematically took out all eight of the other men, tying them up in mish mash of electrical and duck tape and stacking them in a pile nearby.</p>\n<p>Finishing this, the kid grabbed Cold before he hit the ground and performing first aide and looking relieved at seeing the armor under Cold's gear. Then he positively cacooned the man in the remaining tapes, dropping him on top of his men.</p>\n<p>Then he suddenly found the kid splinting his leg and then carrying him away until he was behind a clinic.</p>\n<p>From first strike to that last act might have last 20 seconds tops.</p>\n<p>Somehow, some way, Barry just knew this kid was the one that had been watching him for the last month or so. Like something deep within him recognized him.</p>\n<p>The validation that he was right in his paranoia was trumped by the fact that there was another speedster in front of him, one he definitely did not recognize (he had a feeling even if he had a look at the kid's face he'd <em>still</em> would not recognize him).</p>\n<p>Where did he come from? Was this another relative from the future? Some unfortunate kid that got lucky/unlucky? And what was the deal with his outfit?</p>\n<p>\"Arvyu a'igh anbum vivin?\"</p>\n<p>Barry had no idea what he said but the tone made him think the kid had asked if he was alright, so he nodded.</p>\n<p>The kid nodded at his work and started to move away.</p>\n<p>And proceeded to trip and fall flat on his face, a utterly destroyed croc going flying over head.</p>\n<p>A sickenly 'splat' was heard, and the kid started swearing. Or at least he thinks the kid was swearing, it was hard to tell as the hood was muffling everything that came out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>The kid got back up, the banana that had been tapped to his chest completely squashed (Barry let out a relieved sigh that the splat hadn't been something internal making that noise) and yanked off his other croc as well as his completely worned down socks.</p>\n<p>Which had no sole left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And immedately disintegrated into pieces in the kid's hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Muvverphmer!\" The kid said, his bandana'd upper face showing clear annoyance. \"Vahf a ffth fyme vns fymyn.\"</p>\n<p>Barry couldn't stop from laughing. Now that he was focusing he could almost make out what the kid was saying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently the kid was discovering that super speed and normal shoes don't mix well... which meant the kid was still figuring this out if he hadn't learned that yet.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that can happen. I went through nearly all my shoes the first time I got my power.\"</p>\n<p>The kid looked super annoyed but accepting before pointing to his leg.</p>\n<p>Barry got the message, though he was curious as to why the kid didn't just pull the hood open to speak.</p>\n<p>\"It'll heal. Good job back there by the way.\"</p>\n<p>The kid preened under the praise and Barry had to stop himself from cooing at the teen. He just looked so happy!</p>\n<p>\"Mind taking the hood down? Kinda hard to understand you.\" Barry asked, frowning as the kid tightened his hood as he rapidly shook his head.</p>\n<p>\"You don't want me seeing your face?\"</p>\n<p>The kid paused for a moment before nodding in a way that almost felt like 'yeah, let's go with that'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right, teen with maybe new powers, probably only approuched him because he was known. Might be why he was wearing a outfit that made Barry's fashion sense hurt.</p>\n<p>\"Fuwwy ahm mof iwwy iv'a moo voh amfer fesins. Ah'm usa iy oh hafaion.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"I understood absolutely nothing of what you just said.\" Barry told him cheerfully, hiding a wince from the broken leg.</p>\n<p>\"Eff'enb, en ah ahn ay at off val ba eros ah'v elf'b en va as upple uf mumphs ooh ahr vy ar ny fifer'it. Feeb Forfe vevs hy by va hay.\" The kid muffled, looking suddenly pleased with himself.</p>\n<p>Barry was pretty certain he was being messed with, he just knew it. And maybe he shouldn't encourage this but he has helped raised a teen speedster before.</p>\n<p>\"I take it you are the guy that was stalking me for the last month?\"</p>\n<p>The kid nodded without hesitancy. Well that was one mystery solved.</p>\n<p>\"How long have you been able to speed run?\" Barry asked as he was unsure if the kid even knew where the source of his power came from.</p>\n<p>The boy held up four fingers.</p>\n<p>\"Four... months?\" <em>Yikes</em>, that was new.</p>\n<p>The kid shook his head, making Barry feel something drop in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\"Four... weeks?\" He asked weakly, feeling anxious when the kid vigorously nodded with a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>Shit, the kid got his powers practically yesterday!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>, okay, Barry could do this. He had a baby speedster who practically acquired his powers overnight and had managed to successfully stalk Barry for a month without him catching him. He had no idea how he did that, but Barry could be patient.</p>\n<p>First order of business though was getting the kid to talk to him properly.</p>\n<p>\"Talk normally and I'll get you a pair of genuine Flash boots.\"</p>\n<p>The kid didn't look convinced.</p>\n<p>\"Or I can give you the blue prints so you can make your own shoes.\"</p>\n<p>He may in fact just give him the prints for an entire outfit. Kid needs protection, not a hodge podge mess that looks like he raided a dumpster and will fall apart because it can't withstand the velocity he put it through.</p>\n<p>The kid yanked the hood down before pulling it back just enough so he could see under it.</p>\n<p>\"Deal!\" The kid chirped, showing that the bandana covered... his whole face.</p>\n<p>Well that explained why anything he said was unintelligible.</p>\n<p>\"So what's your name?\" Barry asked, tugging at his cowl.</p>\n<p>Best start simple, give the kid a foundation to start trusting him in.</p>\n<p>That and give Wally a moment to track the tracker in his suit he just activated while adjusting his cowl.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Cosplay Man!\" The kid cheerfully informed him and Barry couldn't stop the chuckles that came out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Barry should have expected that. Kid must still be wary of revealing his identity if he just abtained super speed. Probably only stalked Barry because he was both unsure if he'd help but trusting him not to hurt him if caught.</p>\n<p>Barry was just going to have to prove to the teen he could be trusted.</p>\n<p>\"More specifically, I'm cosplaying as you.\"</p>\n<p>Barry blinked at that, wondering if he should be offended.</p>\n<p>... and then he remembered Wally going to a costume party as him but as the most trashy looking drag queen version of the Flash imaginable with Dick Grayson right there next to him in garter belts, fishnets and padding with the most ludicrously done make up as Batman and decided this was <em>not</em> the worst costume he has ever seen of himself.</p>\n<p>He still had that picture on his wall in the Tower.</p>\n<p>\"Neat, once we get you your blue prints I'm sure you'll design it to suit your needs.\" Barry told him, feeling concern when the kid visably looked surprised at his blas\u00e9 response (how with a bandana covering his face he was unsure).</p>\n<p>\"Huh, I expected more offense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? You saw me in danger and had no gear so you made due. And I'll never judge anyone doing everything they can while trying to keep their identity hidden in order to have a normal life.\"</p>\n<p>Barry was a bit worried that the kid was so clearly touched by his words. Did the kid get negative reactions for his cobbled suits? Or just not enough support in his every day life?</p>\n<p>\"Right, you are <em>offically</em> my favorite hero.\" The kid told him, making Barry put the tiny check mark by the mental box he started for Cosplay Man that says 'Not used to positive reinforcement.'</p>\n<p>\"Nice, I will absolutely rub it into my colleague's faces. So is there someone, who knows about your... new hobby?\" Did the kid at least have someone else for support?</p>\n<p>\"You mean the hero gig? A couple of people know but most are my age.\"</p>\n<p>\"No adults?\" Did the kid not trust any adults or was he too scared by his ( very new) power and was hoping Barry could help him?</p>\n<p>\"I mean Fruitloop knows about me but that guy is stranger danger incarnate. Like seriously, creep's a walking red flag. No means no! Except he's got more money then sense so he thinks he can buy everything. And when he couldn't, he dragged me into that creepy dungeon of his and took my--\" The kid suddenly clammed up, body tensing as though he was suddenly aware of what he was saying and the way Barry had started vibrating so hard the seat he was on started humming.</p>\n<p>\"He. Did. What?\" Barry asked calmly, mentally slugging himself for asking a potential sexual harassed victim that.</p>\n<p>(<em>Please don't be that. Please please please--)</em></p>\n<p>\"Uuuuuh, nothing? He most <em>definitely</em> did not do <em>anything</em> to me. Not a <em>thing</em>. And even <em>if</em> he <em>did</em>, no one can <em>prove</em> it. I know, I <em>tried</em>.\" The kid poorly lied.</p>\n<p>Barry took a deep breath, still vibrating.</p>\n<p>\"Do your parents know?\" Surely they would have done something had they known?</p>\n<p>\"No? Dad is convinced that's his best friend and they constantly are telling me to spend time with him because he's my godfather. I keep telling them he's shifty as hell but they don't listen because he's such a 'good friend'.\" The kid explained, using his fingers to air quote the 'good friend'.</p>\n<p>The kid must have seen something on his face because he hurriedly added, \"It's okay! Really! For a long time they never took anything I said seriously!\"</p>\n<p>Barry didn't know what upset him more, that the kid was used to not being heard or that he genuinely believed that would reassure Barry.</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p>Barry was going to need to pummel a (possible, maybe, signs are pointing to 'yes') sexual predator. And spell it out to the kid's parents that their son was being targeted by someone they thought was a friend. And hammer it in their heads that their<em><strong> young teenage son</strong> had told them he did</em>\u00a0<strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>feel <strong>safe</strong> with a <strong>older man</strong> that they insisted he spend time with, and demand to know why they did <strong>not</strong> question</em> <em><strong>why</strong> he did <strong>not feel safe</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><em>Right</em>.</p>\n<p>Maybe he could get Bruce to give him pointers on how to destroy a man so thoroughly that even if he got out of jail he'll be targeted.</p>\n<p>(Fun fact about Bruce: he was all for criminal rehabilitation, helped many in fact. He has also ensured sexual predators, like say child rapists, were so doomed that death would be preferable. Nothing could save them because as far as the Dark Knight was concerned, they had no redeeming qualities left)</p>\n<p>Barry looked back at the kid who was currently prying the squished banana off, eating the parts that weren't too mushy and suddenly realized the kid was skinny.</p>\n<p>Like missed too many meals skinny, maybe got food withheld skinny. His wrist (visible from where he had been pulling off that banana) was so very thin, as were his very bare feet and ankles.</p>\n<p>Was this kid eating? Holy shit, did this kid know speedsters needed to eat more then the average human? Was the kid burning through his own body without knowing it?!</p>\n<p>\"Hey Cosplay, when was the last time you ate?\"</p>\n<p>Barry was not reassured (though mildly amused) when the kid pointed to the banana. \"And before that?\"</p>\n<p>Cosplay Man shrugged, making a 'I dunno' noise.</p>\n<p>\"... Don't take this wrong, but do you have a home that you can go to?\" Because now that he was <em>actually</em> studying the teen, he looked a little bit homeless.</p>\n<p>The kid responded in a carefully measured tone. \"I have one I could return to, yes.\"</p>\n<p><em>Could</em>, not <em>would</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>Great, he had a maybe homeless and definitely starving child that just acquired new powers in front of him (and suddenly he wondered if the crappy costume was created due to lack of funds).\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulled out his wallet (feeling amusement when the kid mumbled \"Where the hell did you pull that from?\") and threw a fifty at him.</p>\n<p>\"There is a pizzaria a block from here. Go buy the biggest pizza you can and eat it.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0Barry must feed the child, he was all skin and bones. And kill his godfather and help mentor him, but feeding him took precedent. No child was starving on Barry's watch! He was going to parent this teen, this was his child now and he'll fight anyone who tried to take him.</p>\n<p>Before the kid could say anything Wally showed up, skidding to a halt in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"Flash! I can as soon as I could-- <em>what</em> are you wearing?\" The last bit directed at Cosplay Man, the kid stuffing the fifty back in Barry's hand while he was distracted.</p>\n<p>\"Well!\" The kid said loudly, backing away before Barry could shove the money back at him. \"You have someone to see to your medical needs so I will be off! I'll see you in a month or two for those prints. Cosplay Man: The Flash edition, awwwaaaaaay!\"</p>\n<p>The kid turned and... started jogging sedately away. Cosplay Man stopped about twenty feet away, looking confused for a moment before smacking his head.</p>\n<p>\"Damn it, I wasn't in character! Okay, take two.\" He mumbled, drawing the strings to his hood tightly before making a silly pose.</p>\n<p>\"Osey Mnm: ah Aff ebi'in, awwaaaaaaaah!\" And with that, the kid took off, leaving behind a trail of after images that looked to be flapping their arms around and making howler monkey noises before dissipating.</p>\n<p>\"... Flash? Does Impulse have a younger brother we didn't know about?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not to my knowledge. By the way, did Nightwing ever succeed in convincing you to get emergency foster parent license?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah? Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I may not qualify as a good guardian once I get my hands on that kid's godfather.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why would you-\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm like eighty percent certain his godfather sexually abuses him.\"</p>\n<p>\"... tell me everything. We can make it look like an accident.\"</p>\n<p>Danny giggled as he chucked the clothes away, getting back into his real clothes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flash was so nice! And he even tried to feed him! Definitely was coming back later, that guy was the best. And Danny could just hang out with him now instead of stalking him! Maybe get actual pointers instead of deducing his methods! Best day ever!</p>\n<p>He thanked Speed Force for the use of their powers before heading to the bus station. He was no longer in Missouri, having ran quite a bit to put distance and ended up back in Metropolis again (he was still struggling to correctly estimate the distance VS speed when he used Speed Force. Sometimes he got it, most of the time he was way off the mark) and decided to take the tour bus before wandering over to Gotham.</p>\n<p>The tour was nice and relaxing, and he ate his weight in pasta when the tour went to a lovely little mom and pop's store and ate his weight in pasta generously provided with Lex \"Bald Vlad\" Luthor's stolen credit card (running on Speed Force always made him so hungry, he'll have to ask if that's normal).</p>\n<p>He was studying his map for the longest route to Gotham when he walked into a tall lady, nearly knocking her over and spilling his bag of snacks.</p>\n<p>\"Crap, I'm so sorry ma'am!\" He apologized, getting waved off by the lady who smiled kindly at him.</p>\n<p>\"No harm done, I wasn't paying attention either.\" She replied, helping him gather the snacks. \"Planning on feeding a army with this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe, want some? The nutty bars didn't get crushed.\"</p>\n<p>She huffed a laugh. \"I'm good, thank you though.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>She then spotted his map, making a 'oh noise. \"Heading to Gotham? I have some friends there, though I'm not particularly fond of the city itself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eventually, I'm kinda on vacation so mostly just meandering.\" he replied, holding a hand out. \"I'm Danny.\"</p>\n<p>The tall lady smiled as she shook his hand. \"Diana, nice to meet you.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, Danny should have seen this happening. Pretty typical Fenton luck right here.</p>\n<p>He had decided on another tour when he told Diana Prince --the nice tall lady he ran into-- he loved space and she suggested the Metropolis space exploration museum.</p>\n<p>Danny being Danny had invited her since she told him she had time to kill and she agreed. Why she agreed he was unsure but he was glad she came along because going to museums is so much better with someone else.</p>\n<p>They were half through when-- you guessed it-- a villain attacked, a furry-woman who was screeching about a wonderful woman who she was demanding to show herself.</p>\n<p>Sounded like a bad break up, to be honest.</p>\n<p>Then he lost Diana for a few minutes, went invisible and found her hiding behind a barrier and then watched her spin and transform into what he was assuming was her hero alter ego.</p>\n<p>So typical Fenton luck.</p>\n<p>(It was simple as far as magical girl transformations went, a solid five stars for practicality and a extra two stars for dressing like a Amazon warrior rather then a porn star or a high schooler who just discovered she had boobs)</p>\n<p>Danny watched the fight for a few minutes before bribing Speed Force with a pound of fudge he got from a really nice mom and pop's store to let him use speed to do a quick study on the lady.</p>\n<p>Apparently her hero name was Wonder Woman (which sounded a little pretentious but as she was considered one of the first heros from multiple sources, he'll give her a pass) and she was a genuine Amazonian princess (that's so cool! He was curious if she knew Pandora) could fly, had bracers that let her deflect stuff, a invisible jet (how does she not loose that?), strength and speed, near invulnerability to physical harm, formidable combat prowess, and a lasso.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was only the barebones but he was intrigued, though he took a slight detour and grabbed a bunch of things to go into cosplay and calling the police. Just in case.</p>\n<p>Which proved to have been the right choice as Meowdame Pussycat had gotten Lady of Wonders pinned, tied in the lasso and the way she was talking was only fueling his belief these two had a messy breakup and need couples counciling or a restraining order.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't be as good as the others since he didn't even have a hour to study Princess Amazing but he had trained with Pandora so hopefully he would be able to pull off this well.</p>\n<p>If all goes well and he sees her again, he'll do better next time.</p>\n<p>Diana had dropped her guard, a costly mistake as Cheetah had taken ruthless advantage of her momentary inattentiveness that resulted in a dislocated her leg and Diana was fairly certain she had a concussion and to add insult to injury Cheetah used her own lasso to trap her arms.</p>\n<p>This wasn't the worst thing Diana has suffered and she was getting ready to pull Cheetah towards her by sheer strength alone when a young faux-female voice in a weird accent yelled out.</p>\n<p>\"Halt evildoer!\"</p>\n<p>She and Cheetah both turned, Cheetah no doubt to see who was trying to stop her and Diana to see if a hero had come to aide her.</p>\n<p>And very studiously pretended when Cheetah whispered \"What the hell.\" that she had <em>no idea</em> why she said that.</p>\n<p>A teen stood nearby, hands on hip in a pose that looked more middle-aged PTA mom then heroic while wearing a grown adult's onesie.</p>\n<p>A onesie with her body printed on the front, a grass skirt tied around the waist, yellow duck print rain boots, literal hand mirrors taped to the forearms, a mop on his head that was so dirty it was a very dark gray with a tiara keeping it pinned, a green glittery jump rope acting as a lasso in hand and on his face was a Superman cartoon mask with huge badly done lipstick doodled on it along with eyelashes clearly done in the same bright red lipstick color.</p>\n<p>How badly had Cheetah cracked her head?</p>\n<p>\"I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves!\" He exclaimed, and she winced both at the volume and the badly done accent that sounded nothing like her.</p>\n<p>She has had many people who has role played as her, few even attempted to fight crime dressed up as her. But none have ever dressed so... peculiarly while doing it.</p>\n<p>Cheetah spoke before she could gather enough sense to tell him to leave before he got hurt.</p>\n<p>\"Why are you talking like Clarabelle Cow?\"</p>\n<p>The boy ignore this, making a loud gasping sound. \"Suffering Sappho! I will rescue you, Random Citizen, from the fearsome fiesty flirtatious feline!\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>What</em> did you call me--\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly the boy flew at Cheetah in perfectly executed flying leap kick, sending her flying from Diana.</p>\n<p>It happened so fast Diana startled for a moment before taking the moment to wiggle out of the lasso. She then stuck the lasso between her teeth as she set her leg back in, nearly screaming. She blinked out the tears before forcing herself to stand, ready to join the fray.</p>\n<p>Except the boy was skillfully fending off Cheetah with a certain amount of deftness that spoke of expirence.</p>\n<p>With moves you can only learn on Themyscira.</p>\n<p>\u00a0How does he know Amazonian combat techniques?!</p>\n<p>She leaned against the wall, eyes glued to the questionably dressed lad as he methodically dismantled Cheetah in quick and efficient tactics before he threw his glowing green 'lasso', tying Cheetah up so it would not be easy to escape.</p>\n<p>\"In the name of Merciful Minerva! Surrender, you fiendishly fiendish fiend who fiends!\" He exclaimed in that faux-woman voice, causing Diana to wince at both the pitch he hit and the sheer asinine words coming from his mouth.</p>\n<p>Cheetah had looked perplexed the whole fight and was now not even trying to escape the jump rope, staring at him in disbelief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Are you even trying to portray her semi-correctly or are you just flat out ridiculing her?\" Cheetah demanded, looking offended on Diana's behalf.</p>\n<p>The boy suddenly spoke in a normal voice, sounding annoyed but with himself. \"In my defense, I had like five minutes to cobble this get up together and only roughly ten minutes worth of studying.\"</p>\n<p>\"That was painfully obvious. I bet Superman is actually your favorite.\"</p>\n<p>\"Commander Steel-Thong? Nah, I like the Flash right now though I really hope I can meet the Martian Manhunter.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's one of the good ones, but that still doesn't change the fact you are clearly mocking my archenemy.\" Cheetah replied, not so subtly trying to get out of the jump rope but it wasn't giving.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not trying to mock anyone, I just have like three dollars and two nickels in my pockets. I was a little desperate, especially since I only had enough time to skim the basics on her. If I ever have to cosplay as Wonder Woman again, I'll try to make it nicer.\"</p>\n<p>\"See to it that you do, it reflects badly on me if you can easily beat me while dressed like a cheap knock off of my rival.\" Cheetah chided.</p>\n<p>Diana had lost track of this conversation. Was Cheetah really scolding a teenager for poorly dressing up as her?</p>\n<p>The two continued this conversation, the boy holding the fake lasso while Cheetah tried to escape but failed (it looked like a normal jump rope yet she couldn't break it, enchanted perhaps? Or a scientific invention?), chatting like this was a coffee meet up between a pair of students in different fields rather then a boy dressed as a silly version of her and a dangerous villian.</p>\n<p>Truly, how hard did Cheetah hit her?</p>\n<p>Mercifully the sounds of sirens closing in was heard and soon Diana was giving a report as the police took Cheetah in custody.</p>\n<p>She headed towards the boy, intending to thank him and then ask where he learned those techniques.</p>\n<p>The lad saw her coming and struck a stupid pose, making her stop for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Random Citizen?\" He asked in that silly accent, barely stopping when she confirmed she was.</p>\n<p>\"Then I will leave this devious dame of dastardly deeds in your hands! Cosplay Man: Wonder Woman Edition, awaaaaaaay!\"</p>\n<p>He then turned and... acted like he was mounting a bicycle... and peddled quickly away.</p>\n<p>Everyone stopped to watch this teenager seemingly ride off on a invisible bike, making bicycle bell noises before rapidly taking the corner out of sight.</p>\n<p>It was silent for a moment before Cheetah spoke. \"I like him, very polite. His outfit needs work though. And he needs to stop those awful alliterations.\"</p>\n<p>Diana wasted no time and soon Cheetah was off to prison and she was discussing with the museum director how to get the mess cleaned up and fixed (she thanked Minerva nothing important was damage) before leaving, intent on tracking done 'Cosplay Man' and getting him to tell her where he learned Amazonian battle techniques.</p>\n<p>She found a empty spot and changed back, downed some pills that the science division in the Watch Tower to help with concussions and strained limbs (she was so glad to her body could heal itself and it would be better by tomorrow at the latest) and begun to head towards the exit when movement caught her eye.</p>\n<p>Hiding behind a desk was Danny, peaking out from the top with a worried expression.</p>\n<p>Diana suddenly felt ashamed as she had forgotten about him. She had pushed him towards the exit before transforming, believing he'd flee like everyone else yet here he was.</p>\n<p>She made her way towards him, intending to take him outside where it was away from the police when she spotted something that caused her to pause.</p>\n<p>Sticking out of his bag was the green glittery jump rope.</p>\n<p>Looking back at Danny, she caught his eyes that had widened in a familar expression that many Teen Titans would have when caught in a area they had been told to evacuate.</p>\n<p>But Danny wasn't a Teen Titan. He shouldn't know how to fight like a Amazon either.</p>\n<p>\"Are you okay?\" He asked, sounding genuinely concerned.</p>\n<p>\"I am... well.\" She replied, unsure how to approach this when he stood up with a relieved smile.</p>\n<p>\"So Cosplay Man.\" She started, feeling a little guilty at knocking his smile off. \"I can see your 'lasso'.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah. Dammit.\" He grumbled, stuffing the rope completely in his bag before looking back up. \"Wonder Woman. I know it might sound hypocritical but you really should hide better when doing your magical girl transformation.\"</p>\n<p>Which was fair, she had clearly missed him if he had seen her transform. A reminder to be more diligent in the future.</p>\n<p>\"Look, I'm not going to tell anyone. What you do is none of my business. I'm just a guy on vacation and only stepped in because you looked to be stuck. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten involved.\"</p>\n<p>She wasn't using her lasso but she felt he was being truthful. Still, she had questions.</p>\n<p>\"Where did you learn Amazonian combat techniques? That is not something that is taught publicly.\" <em>Or to men</em>, she mentally added.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I'm friends with this Amazon called Pandora. Scary and can kick my ass seven ways to Sunday but she's a good friend.\"</p>\n<p>Diana frowned at the name. Pandora was a being in Themyscira history who had sacrificed her very life to stop a great evil. Legend said she still watches over the container the evil was confined to, even in death.</p>\n<p>Pandora was often used as a example of duty and resilience as well as a sign of dedication.</p>\n<p>She was also used as a sign to herald great changes and potential disasters.</p>\n<p>For a Amazon to use that name was concerning as it could be construed as a sign of changes coming and she saw herself as it's herald. The Amazon in question could have been given that name at birth yet it was a name not given lightly and Diana couldn't see her mother not paying special attention to such a girl given a name with that kind of weight.</p>\n<p>\"Have you seen her recently?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Not in a few months, but I've been traveling a lot. But she and my Mom are friends and like to fight to see which is stronger and they keep ending in draws. Pretty sure if my mom wasn't happily married and totally in love with my dad, Pandora would have tried to seduce her.\"</p>\n<p>Diana snorted at that, lips twitching into a smile. His mother must be a incredible fighter if she could make a Amazon bearing such a name be interested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would seem Danny had inherited his mother's combat prowess. Though she wondered if perhaps his mother was a Amazon as well, that would make Pandora's mentorship understandable.</p>\n<p>Still, he seemed like a honorable man so Diana wouldn't question him further. At least for now.</p>\n<p>\"May I have your phone?\" Danny nodded, looking confused as she took it and entered her own phone number into the Nokia (odd choice for a phone considering it looked like a older model) before handing it back.</p>\n<p>\"I have duties to attend to but would like to keep in touch. And perhaps give you pointers, in both fighting and disguises.\" Especially that last one as he hadn't even worn padding for Hera's sake.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, don't take this wrong, but I really don't want to make it a habit to dress up like you since Im really just a guy on vacation. The world has plenty of heroes and I am perfectly okay with letting them do their job.\"</p>\n<p>So he was a civilian who felt compelled to protect someone he just met? And had no desire to go pro into heroics?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce and Clark would be as relieved as she was had they been in her position. A strong meta like Danny prefered not to get involved in dangerous settings was a rare blessing.</p>\n<p>\"Oh? Too embaressing to be seen in a heroine's costume?\" She asked instead, curious.</p>\n<p>\"No that doesn't bother me, it's just you give off this vibe that makes me feel like I'm about to get in trouble with the unholy amalgamation of Pandora, Mom and my sister. Like I feel like a drew a mustache on your picture and those three are going to pop up and be disappointed in my actions.\"</p>\n<p>\"You hold them in high regards.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course I do, they're badass scary ladies who haven't bothered to take over the world because it would be too easy for them.\"</p>\n<p>They laughed at his words before he made a \"Ah!\" noise, digging out the green jump rope.</p>\n<p>\"If you need to take it, I understand. The uh, magic should be worn off though.\"</p>\n<p>She took it, examining the toy. It really did seem to be just a ordinary rope now. Still, she'll keep it and examine it further.</p>\n<p>Another tic in the 'Danny really just wants to be a citizen' chart.</p>\n<p>\"What was it doing to prevent Cheetah from escaping?\"</p>\n<p>\"All it did was make the jump rope stronger and clingy. Like the more you struggle the harder it got to escape. I didn't want to hurt her, just detain her until the police arrived.\"</p>\n<p>Diana decided Danny was a good man and would trust her instincts that said he would keep her secret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She wanted to know more about the meta boy's Amazon friend but she could be patient.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>After all, it wasn't like Danny was looking for trouble with his 'Cosplay Man' persona. She'd have heard of him if he was.</p>\n<p>Though there was one final question she needed answered.</p>\n<p>\"Did you really ride a invisible bycycle out of there or was that you flying with flair?\"</p>\n<p>Danny said his goodbyes to Diana, feeling super giddy that he was on first name basis with a <em>actual</em> hero!</p>\n<p>Of course, he wouldn't tell her he was a hero too since he was not a hero in <em>this</em> world and had no intentions to start being one in this world. Still, it was awesome because if he was careful maybe she could give him advice on some stuff, hero to hero-on-vacation.</p>\n<p>And he wouldn't even have to stalk her to learn!</p>\n<p>He felt a little mean for giving her that jump rope after sucking all the ectoplasm back in. But he was fairly certain she'd have asked for it anyways as from her point of view he was a civilian playing at heroics, it makes perfect sense to remove a potentially dangerous tool from inexperience hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Danny was still hyped by the fact he made friends with a <em>real</em> hero! And after looking her up without the need to rush it he discovered she was one of the coolest heros ever! And she hadn't really been offended by his costume but had told him if he had to cosplay as her again she was requesting he put actual armor on, still unaware he could shrug lethal blows off.</p>\n<p>She was going right next to the Flash in terms of best heroes in his books.</p>\n<p>\"Attention: the bus to Gotham leaves in ten minutes--\" the bus station people called over the intercom and Danny made his way toward his designated ride.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took a seat and started looking up the notorious city, as well as it's diverse vigilante population.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gotham was the deranged love child of Dark Pariah, Walker, Spectra and Dan, conceived in a ritualistic orgy when all the fruitloop stars were aligned slightly to the left of where they were suppose to be, then raised jointly by Skulker, Freakshow, Vlad and Box Ghost before being abandoned in opium den where they rose to be the biggest sugar baby to every sick freak possible and no god of any dimension could convince Danny otherwise.</p>\n<p>He wasn't talking about the city though, that was a pretty interesting place and if he wasn't visiting another world he'd have totally invited Sam here.</p>\n<p>No, he meant Gotham the spirit of this insanely gloomy city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lot of cities in this dimension had spirits that seemed to have formed over time and most were content to ignored his existence after a brief welcome.</p>\n<p>Metropolis had started interacting with him and sending him memos of places he should visit within her domain. She often looked like a business woman in a immaculate suit but there was dirt staining her pant legs and flecks of blood would appear randomly across her, face shifting from genuine genial to aloof in a flash. Sometimes after a big fight she'd look ragged and bruised like she had just gone ten rounds with Fright Knight.</p>\n<p>Gotham on the other hand looked like he belonged on the cover of a Borderlands game or a Mad Max film. Or maybe Bioshock. Or some sick merger of the three.</p>\n<p>Tall with a form that sometimes changed to looking like he was built like a fridge to being a shriveled up old creep. Scars littered his body, sometimes his teeth were too many and razor sharp and others he only had like three as though someone had taken the time to knock as many out as possible, a long crooked nose set in a face that was often gaunt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes his eyes glowed with a magnificent madness and then go cold with sane inhumanity, and then there were times they'd be empty sockets.</p>\n<p>(He was kinder and more humane when he was blind)</p>\n<p>But through it all he wore a suit that looked like it belonged in the 1920s that sometimes looked pristine and other times torn and filthy and a ever changing half mask that seemed to alter with his dynamical moods.</p>\n<p>Luckily Danny caught him in one of his blind moods and thus was not going to try and fist fight him. Or adopt him. Or poison him. Or flirt with him. Or some twisted combination of all the above.</p>\n<p>\"Hello little king,\" Gotham greeted, voice soft in a way that reminded Danny of the too sharp edge of a well cared for blade. \"How are my knights? Do they inspire a need for mockery yet?\"</p>\n<p>\"You know you shouldn't wish for your knights to get into such trouble that I have to bail them out.\"</p>\n<p>\"You had no problem doing it over the bay. That strumpet won't stop bragging you did it twice at her domain.\"</p>\n<p>Fun fact: the spirits of the cities were taking bets on whose heroes he'll be cosplaying next and apparently Metropolis was being smug over him cosplaying as two different heroes in her domain.</p>\n<p>He had no idea how the cities communicated considering the distance between a lot of them but Gotham and Metropolis had a long standing frienemy relationship and seemed to be constantly trying to one up each other. Which sucked for the residences as this translated to rogues, aliens, crazies, furries and quirky-to-evil billionaires.</p>\n<p>Still, Gotham was positively pouty that he hadn't started cosplaying any of his heroes.</p>\n<p>\"You've been here for a month yet not once have you've tried your cosplay hobby.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because they haven't gotten into trouble while I've studied them. And I promise I will leave and save heroes over in Metropolis if you suddenly start placing them in danger.\" Danny warned, fully believing Gotham was petty enough to do that.</p>\n<p>Just look at what he allowed the Rogues to get away with.</p>\n<p>The thing was Danny actually liked the vigilantes, loving their different personalities and fighting styles. If they weren't part of Gotham he'd totally stay much longer.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the spirit of Gotham was a certified fruitloop.</p>\n<p>The entity had the gall to pout like Danny was being a unreasonable person.</p>\n<p>\"<em>I'm</em> not putting them in danger.\" The entity said in faux outrage, and Danny zeroed in on the way he emphasized on his first word.</p>\n<p>\"Gotham, what did you do?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing! ... <em>this</em> time. Completely related, how is that stockpile of hero cosplay outfits coming along?\"</p>\n<p>Upon realizing that he was the main entertainment of a bunch of city spirits Danny had start grabbing and creating his whimsical styles for the now inevitable problems the poor unfortunate heroes would get caught up in.</p>\n<p>Gotham though had so many, like just how bad was Gotham's crime problems that a entire battalion was needed?</p>\n<p>The answer was: <em><u>Yes, all of them</u></em>.</p>\n<p>\"What's happening?\"</p>\n<p>\"I have not done anything, but that doesn't mean the rogues haven't decided to cause problems. I am requesting you go,\" Gotham pointed to the far side of his city, Ace Chemicals lighting up in a supernatural aura, \"and keep my knights safe. You shouldn't need to enter that place in particular, the place you need is actually two block over.\"</p>\n<p>\"And who am I rescuing?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, the usual. Nightwing, Red Hood, Spoiler, Robin, Red Robin and Batman. They are stepping into one of the more clever traps. You'll have about... Twenty minutes? Roughly twenty minutes before things get ugly. That'll be fifteen minutes to get there and five to rescue them.\"</p>\n<p>Danny sighed, not for the first time cursing his protection obsession.</p>\n<p>\"For the record, I hate you.\"</p>\n<p>The entity grinned in humanly wide with way too many needle like teeth that only made those empty sockets look all the more eerie, the mask shifting into a burlap/clownlike visor.</p>\n<p>\"For the record my dear king, I don't give a shit. Now off you go!\"</p>\n<p>And with that the bastard shoved Danny off the building.</p>\n<p>Danny was <em>so not</em> going to visit this guy for a <em>while</em> after this.</p>\n<p>Getting there did indeed take about fifteen minutes and he dressed in his get up on the way, taking a extra three minutes to spread his outfits about as he checked at what he was dealing with.</p>\n<p>A big guy who has serious hateboner for cars, Evil Redhead Sam, dude in a tacky green suit with question marks, a weirdo in a burlap sack, a guy who dresses like a pimp, a chick in a jester outfit and a guy that looks like Freakshow's ugly twin.</p>\n<p>Right, best make this quick.</p>\n<p>\"Halt evil doer!\"</p>\n<p>It was a trap and she missed it.</p>\n<p>Six hours after Barbara started her day as Oracle multiple calls were sent in warning of Scarecrow gas in near the Ace Chemical plant.</p>\n<p>When that happened it tended to be a all hands on deck sort of issue, and unfortunately she didn't see it for what it was until Bruce, Damian, Tim, Dick, Steph and Jason were caught by Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>Then it escalated when Bane, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Penguin, Harley Quinn and the damn Joker showed up to party.</p>\n<p>She was calling in back up, praying Luke and the others could get there in time when a staticky voice rang out, \"Halt evil doer!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>All heads turned and Barabara wanted to scream.</p>\n<p>There was a kid, could not be much older then Damian posing on a over turned car deciding to play hero.</p>\n<p>Then she registered what the idiot was wearing.</p>\n<p>The kid was dressed in a sequin covered Elvis suit with a massive pompadour and a Batman mask on while holding drum sticks with... where those tazers duck taped to the end?</p>\n<p>\"I'm The Stuff Of Nightmares.\u201d the kid said drawling voice, the Elvis Presley accent undermining the threat behind those words.</p>\n<p>\"... is that suppose to be Nightwing?\" Riddler asked.</p>\n<p>It was then that she saw the sprayed on blue bird symbol on the kid's front.</p>\n<p>Oh god, this idiot was trying to take on rogues dressed as a shitty Nightwing, he was going to die--</p>\n<p>Suddenly the kid rushed forward in a blur of white, blue and sequins, landing a perfect drop kick on the Riddler that sent him flying away from the other rogues and suddenly there was a screech as the kid tazed him and then ziptied his hands to his feet all in like thirty seconds.</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence, everyone stared in confusion before Bane picked up a nearby light post and chucked it at the kid, yelling \"He's a bat in a shitty costume! Get him!\"</p>\n<p>The kid bodliy threw the Riddler through a nearby window into a mattress store before diving behind another car.</p>\n<p>Joker cackled, saying something about this being funny when the kid launched upwards from his hiding place in a move he should not have the training to preform--</p>\n<p>And he wasn't in his Elvis-Nightwing suit anymore.</p>\n<p>While he was still wearing the sequin pants he was now sporting a black shirt with a red bat plushie taped to the front, a brown jacket and a... red sand bucket with eye holes cut out.</p>\n<p>And holding the second biggest paintball bazooka she has ever seen.</p>\n<p>\"Call me the Red Hood.\" The kid announced in the most stereotypical Scottish accent her ears ever heard and fired his bazooka at Poison Ivy.</p>\n<p>The eco-terrorist was sent ten feet back and stuck to the wall on the other side, a gluey substance keeping her in place.</p>\n<p>The kid threw his improvise weapon and rolled out of Bane's punch then taking a diving leap over another car, grabbing a bucket and upturning it over his own bucket clad head.</p>\n<p>Purple paint poured out and the kid flung his Red Hood bucket at Harley, revealing the Batman mask once more as well as a black cap.</p>\n<p>\"Spoiler Alert!\" The kid yelled, tackling Harley while swinging the paint bucket hard enough on her head there was no doubt she was going to wake up with a goose egg of a welt on her noggin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He threw the unconscious Harley through the mattress window, causing her to land on top of the Riddler who wheezed on impact, the kid not slowing down at all.</p>\n<p>The kid threw his ruined jacket off, making a running slide under a truck.</p>\n<p>Bane wasted no time in throwing the truck out of the way, revealing the kid wearing a red shirt with yellow suspenders and red sheet tied around his neck.</p>\n<p>\"We take pride in crafting craveable burgers, welcoming experiences and genuine connections for everyone who comes into our Red Robin!\" The kid announced in a Mickey Mouse voice, causing several people to stop including Bane at what the kid said as it sounded very similar to the Batburger slogan.</p>\n<p>That small delay was all fake-Red Robin needed to get a punch in. Namely directly at Bane nuts.</p>\n<p>The sound of a something too meaty to be bone crunched under the kid's fist, Barbara still hearing it over the comm even as Bane let out the highest pitch scream that a man his size should <em>not</em> be able to make and he collapsed to the ground clutching his front, whimpering in agony.</p>\n<p>The kid then dived behind the discarded truck, barely missing the Joker's bullets.</p>\n<p>The clown was saying something as he laughed, pulling out a bomb and throwing it as Bruce was nearly free--</p>\n<p>The kid jumped out, wearing a... Robin's onesie with the red sheet still on, the stupid Batman mask still firmly in place.</p>\n<p>And he had a baseball bat that had a bat stuffy on, swinging it at the bomb Joker just threw.</p>\n<p>The thing hit, smacking it right back at the Joker who Barbara got to watch in satisfying glee sporting the most amazing <em>Oh Shit!</em> expression before the bomb went off, causing it to rain deranged clown limbs. Judging by his screaming he was still alive but no amount of surgery was ever going to give him back his limbs.</p>\n<p>\"Holy Hand Grenade, Batman! You could say he went to pieces with with that stunt!\" The kid called out in a absolutely high pitched nasally voice. \"But at least he didn't loose his head there!\"</p>\n<p>Then the kid (in a move she will be spending far too much time trying to figure out how he contorted his body to do that stunt) casually dodged the needle that had been aimed at his neck, back flipping away from the Scarecrow and into a alley.</p>\n<p>He and the Penguin were tense, completely ignoring the vigilantes that were currently using this to escape as they focused on the alley.</p>\n<p>Then from all around a gargling noise could be heard.</p>\n<p>\"Ah ahm vengence, Ah ahm ve niht, Ah ahm Batmam!\u201d and suddenly the kid landed behind Scarecrow. How the hell did he get there?!</p>\n<p>Though that was quickly discarded as she stared at his latest mockery of a suit.</p>\n<p>His cape and cowl was a curtain duck-taped into a barely passable hood into the Batman mask and toilet paper rolls for the ears that were half hazardly taped on. He was wearing rubber dishwater gloves and appeared to have somehow in the barely minute of being unseen stuffed himself in waders, a bright pink with green glitter sash around his waist.</p>\n<p>All in all he looked ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Scarecrow didn't hesitate to spray fear gas directly in the kid's face.</p>\n<p>Everyone was moving to intercept the kid before he started thrashing in terror (after watching him take the others down, no one wanted to see what this kid could do in a blind terror), only to stop short when the kid straight up coldcocked Scarecrow and chucked him into the mattress window, the Riddler giving a pathetic wheeze after crawling out from under Harley only to have Scarecrow land on him.</p>\n<p>Then slowly the kid looked to Penguin, who looked back at him before holding up his hands, smartly surrendering even as he backed towards the actual vigilantes in a clear show of fear for his personal safety.</p>\n<p>She could hear sirens through the comms, meaning her dad was on the way but her eyes were glued to the kid who has yet to move a muscle after clocking Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>Everyone was tense as the kid did not react at all and everyone waited with bated breaths at the inevitable freak out.</p>\n<p>Batman slowly approached the teen in a manner he often did with the others when they've inhaled the fear gas, antidote in hand and getting ready to tackle the kid if he had too, Nightwing and Red Hood fanning out with Robin, Spoiler and Red Robin keeping the Penguin and the others battered rogues in the mattress store at bay if they had to.</p>\n<p>Though everyone present knew the kid that had manage to knock three rogues out, glued Poison Ivy to a wall, dismembered Joker and had very likely shattered Bane's pelvis was the bigger threat. Even Penguin was now sitting on the still out cold Scarecrow and groaning Riddler as though to keep them from trying anything that could set the boy off, Robin and Spoiler having already tied Harley up.</p>\n<p>Then the kid moved, stumbled really away from them.</p>\n<p>\"Fuckin' Turnip Head, spraying me with drugs now I want to eat a whole pizza...\" the kid slurred.</p>\n<p>... what?</p>\n<p>\"Stupid Gotham and his stupid rogues that decide making people have the damn munchies is a good idea. What the heck flavor is this anyway? Watermelon kiwi old crusty socks? <em>Gross</em>.\" The boy, now that she could see him up close thanks to Batman's camera, was maybe a little younger then Duke.</p>\n<p>The kid then looked at Bruce, his face still hidden behind the stupid Batman cartoon mask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Hey, where's the nearest food joint? Fucker prayed me with drugs and now I got a serious case of the munchies. Like holy <em>shit</em>, even the yellow and purple flying meanie hadn't given me cravings this bad.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright? Do you feel... nervous?\" Batman asked in a gentle non-threatening way.</p>\n<p>\"Nah but I think, like, I think watching paint dry right now might be <em>enlightening</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Then the kid bent side ways and Barbara concluded the kid's spine must be a slinky because Dick was pretty much the only person she knew who could contort his body like that with such ease.</p>\n<p>Bruce, who was lowering his hands after an aborted attempt to catch the boy, stared silently. Finally Dick spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Uh buddy? That looks kinda painful. Mind getting back up?\"</p>\n<p>The kid made a humming noise before slowly stretching back into a standing position, nodding to himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"The butts don't match.\" He said will all the wisdom of someone who had discovered a undeniable fact.</p>\n<p>\"...what.\"</p>\n<p>It was bad when even the Penguin joined in to asking that.</p>\n<p>\"The butts. They don't match. Ergo, your not Bruce Wayne.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you talking about that butt match meme?\" Tim demanded, he and several others looking torn between confusion and amusement.</p>\n<p>The kid pointed to Batman. \"No offense, but Bruce Wayne is way juicier, like totally bubble butt. I should know, I've stalked both of you long enough to tell the difference. And your too dad shaped to be him. Ergo, Bruce's bubble butt plus your dad shape does not equal BatWayne Dilfman.\"</p>\n<p>Penguin busted out laughing, and it was clearly taking all of the others training not to burst out into a fit of laughter as well.</p>\n<p>Though the fact the kid was claiming to have successfully stalked both Bruce and Batman was doing a great job in sobering them up.</p>\n<p>( Dick was no doubt going to have a field day knowing someone used that meme he secretly created to make Bruce paranoid to actually try and figure out if Batman and Gotham's playboy billionaire were the same person)</p>\n<p>(She could practically feel Bruce's tired dad look right now as he realized he was dealing with a teenager who was young enough to be in Duke's class who had called his ass juicy)</p>\n<p>\"Like no offense, your dad energy is too strong to be attractive. But it's a <em>dad</em>-dad energy not a <em>daddy</em>-dad energy, totes different.\"</p>\n<p>She could hear everyone trying to regulate their breathing now.</p>\n<p>\"... thank you for clarifying that.\" Bruce said dryly. \"But are you alright?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah <em>dad</em>, I'm peachy.\" He said in a slow yet cheerful manner. \"Been better and certainly not the first time I've been drugged by a baddie, but hey! No fruitloop kidnapped me and did unmentionables things to my body this time, so score.\"</p>\n<p>(Well, the kid was in for it now. Bruce was absolutely going to adopt him or at least make sure he was safe from other predators. And Jason, Tim and Dick will hunt down the bastard who touched their new brother and break everything from the neck down. Even Penguin looked pissed on the teen's behalf seemed ready to offer to make his attacker disappear in a lye bath)</p>\n<p>\"You've been kidnapped?\" Robin demanded, sensibly not adding the violation.</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah, <em>loads</em> of times. Mostly from the fruitloop but Skulker did it a couple of times. Johnny and Kitty that one time. Walker did it too, the bastard. Can you believe he's my grandfather? I dunno how my mom came from such a bitchy tightass who keeps changing the rules to suit his control freak skeleton ass. Ghostwriter once stuck me in a play to teach me the magic of Christmas or something, the jerk... though he was mad I destroyed his work so I kinda deserved to be put in a yuletide hellscape.\" The kid tilted his head humming like he just realized something.</p>\n<p>\"Huh. I've gotten kidnapped, like, a <em>lot</em>.\"</p>\n<p>(Bruce was going to make this kid wear at least three trackers at all times)</p>\n<p>Then the kid started freaking.</p>\n<p>Shit, they let there guard down again and the fear toxin had a delayed reaction--</p>\n<p>\"I can't see my nose. Batman, I lost my nose!\"</p>\n<p>... or the kid was having a bad trip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin, in a rare show of consideration handed him a discarded bat plushie. \"Here's your nose. Wait for it to turn back.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. <em>Okay</em>. Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh, Batman? Police are in inbound, three minutes. You might need to get him out of the way so he can have his episode in peace.\"</p>\n<p>She got a nod before Bruce started slowly making his way towards the swaying teen.</p>\n<p>\"Son, maybe you should sit down.\" Bruce said calmly, not daring to touch the kid unless he was sure the boy wouldn't get violent.</p>\n<p>\"Noooooo dunwanna. Gonna goooo find a hole and sleep it off.\" The kid slurred, pulling out a... green and glittery toy fishing line?</p>\n<p>\"Peace out, Random Citizens. Cosplay Man: Batman slash Batfamily Edition, awwwwaaaaay....\" the kid drawled, throwing his fishing line.</p>\n<p>It landed somewhere inside the alley and he started slowly reeling himself away, flopping onto the ground as the toy making little whining noises that only a fishing line could make, with lethargic speed dragging him across the filthy concrete and eventually off the ground, dangling him about as he very gradually disappeared into the alley.</p>\n<p>\"... Nightwing, you and Red Hood go get him. I'll make sure the Joker, Bane and Ivy are still alive.\" Batman stated, turning to the wounded and incapacitated rogues.</p>\n<p>Turns out the Joker was still unfortunately alive, the burns on his severed limbs having cauterize so he wouldn't bleed to death. The good news though was those burns also made reattaching the limbs a impossibility, so now he was just a head and torso.</p>\n<p>Bane was still in the fetal position, sobbing in agony. A quick scan showed that the kid had <em>pulped</em> his everything from the waist down, with a high chance of crippling him.</p>\n<p>Ivy was stuck to the wall with some very strong glue, her head the only thing not currently in three inches of industrial strength adhesive. Getting that off her was going to be a challenge but it should be a long while before she could do anything. Frankly she had been the lucky one.</p>\n<p>The police arrived, took one look at the carnage and quickly hauled them away for medical attention (she took spiteful amusement at watching her dad casually kick the Joker's limbs towards the people collecting them, a equally spiteful expression on the commissioner's face), the Penguin being perfectly respectful even as he looked entirely too contemplative at the alley Nightwing and Red Hood left from, no 'Cosplay Man' in sight.</p>\n<p>\"He's gone. He might have been playing up how high he was to get away.\" Dick reported, sending her the scans he took of the alley. \"We even looked several blocks over but he's somehow disappeared.\"</p>\n<p>The alley was empty, the only sign the kid had been in there had been a bunch of the discarded earlier 'cosplay outfits'. They'd grab those to run tests on them, try and find any hair or skin on it.</p>\n<p>Still, this was troubling for several reasons.</p>\n<p>So they had a kid who was trained in some manner, has a very unusual reaction to fear gas and capable of shattering bone and reducing flesh to ground meat with a single hit, who was apparently capable of stalking them without any of them noticing him.</p>\n<p>And this unknown very possibly meta kid who could not be older then Duke was out there somewhere, tripping balls on fear gas.</p>\n<p>\"Look for nearby eateries, if he really is expirencing the munchies he'll probably head for the first place that smells good.\" Tim suggested.</p>\n<p>\"I like him and welcome our new member with open arms.\" Jason replied, casually taking pictures of a blank face and limbless Joker before they left, the vigilantes being left alone to look over the scene once her dad got statements.</p>\n<p>\"Tt, he's <em>not</em> our new member.\" Robin scowled, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Hm.\" Batman grunted, which everyone immediately clocked as his 'My adoption senses are tingling' grunt.</p>\n<p>\"Father, no. He may have some skill as a fighter but his vigilante name and gimmick is atrocious!\"</p>\n<p>\"Your just mad he cosplayed as the first Robin.\" Steph teased, chuckling at Damian's offended pout.</p>\n<p>\"He was dressed in a <em>onesie</em>. Those are just stupid pajamas for adults.\"</p>\n<p>\"Still better then his Discowing outfit.\" Jason replied. \"That was literally just a Elvis impersonation with a badly drawn Nightwing symbol on the front.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh, I've seen more offensive ones.\" Dick shrugged, not looking bothered.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Then again, he was impossible to embaress.</em> Barbara thought with a shake of her head.</p>\n<p>\"He put serious effort in mine though.\" Jason claimed, holding of the paint splattered sand bucket.</p>\n<p>\"He literally shrugged off the upper half of his awful Nightwing's outfit and threw on a bucket and jacket!\" Damian exclaimed, looking annoyed.</p>\n<p>\"Hey now, the kid was fighting while cosplaying. We should respect his dedication.\" Steph replied, pointing the the purple splattered all over the area.</p>\n<p>\"See that? His cosplay of me was perfection.\"</p>\n<p>\"He literally threw paint over his head!\"</p>\n<p>\"And then he beat Harley unconscious with that paint can. Absolutely brilliant. Though I do love the little catchphrase he gave me, might have to use it.\"</p>\n<p>\"At least your catchphrase was original, I think he ripped off the Batburger slogan for mine.\" Tim complained.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oracle, see if you can track Cosplay Man through the cameras.\" Batman ordered, looking away from them. \"And send out a message to the others to keep an eye out for him.\"</p>\n<p>\"On it. And when you adopt him, please convince him to come up with a better vigilante name.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll try. But first he's getting professional help for his traumas.\"</p>\n<p>That quickly brought down the mood, the reminder of what the kid had admitted under the influence of the fear gas.</p>\n<p>Yes, regardless they were going to help him. Poor kid has unknowingly been imprinted upon by half the bats present, it was just a matter of time now.</p>\n<p>(Barbara set up a quick betting pool on their newest member having black hair and blue eyes or not)</p>\n<p>Luke's comm crackled to life. \"Is everything alright? Oracle sent an alarm then sent out another detracting that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Batwing, we're fine. Had a unexpected rescue.\" Batman reassured, already scanning the clothes left behind.</p>\n<p>\"From who?\"</p>\n<p>Dick's reply was utterly nonchalant.</p>\n<p>\"Got rescued by a cosplayer.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Ooooooh maaaaaan.\" Danny whined, head between his legs while also hugging his nose-bat-plush-squishy.</p>\n<p>He owed Force Speed <em>so much</em> fudge, they had been the only reason he got in and put of those outfits so fast. Honestly Danny had known Gotham's rogues were bad news so he went fast and hard to take them out and still got a face full of nasty ghost marijuana.</p>\n<p>He was mercifully out of Gotham, the edgy bastard having waved him farewell while flipping Metropolis off.</p>\n<p>He actually had no idea where he was going. After eating his weight in gummy bears and pizza he had jumped into 18-wheeler completely too out of it to care about something paltry like destination.</p>\n<p>All he knew was it was not going through any major city and he had at least six hours to endure.</p>\n<p>\"Eh, dunno where I'm goin' but that's okay.\" He slurred, curling up into a ball between pallets. \"Not a bad ride so far.\"</p>\n<p>He'll figure out the next destination, after he slept.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took an additional eight months before anyone finally realized that Cosplay Man was better known among the Justice League then they thought.</p>\n<p>It started during a meeting and Dr. Fate complaining about a hooligan that made fun of him whenever Fate was having difficulties with his foes, especially Klarion. The chaos lord seemed to get along like a fish to water with the new magic user, whose whole gimmick was dressing as a shoddy version of Fate with a sand bucket as a helmet and acting like a elderly geezer with memory problems and achy joints, the witch boy joining in on the mockery until fake-Fate \"beat\" Klarion in a silly manner and proclaimed himself \"Cosplay Man\" before rushing off.</p>\n<p>It derailed the meeting completely as everyone present began regaling their first encounter with Cosplay Man, or Danny as Diana, Captian Marvel and J'onn revealed as they were the only ones to keep him in one place long enough to get him to give his given name.</p>\n<p>And then someone stated they were planning to adopt the kid and any semblance of order flew out the window as Bruce tried to claim the kid but was loudly shot down by Clark and Hal who both stated they'd be better guardians and it just went downhill from there when Barry jumped onto his chair yelling \"Come at me bro!\" at Oliver when the archer said he'd fist fight everyone for the kid.</p>\n<p>The only one who had not staked a claim in adopting Danny was Captian Marvel, who looked somewhere between amused and exasperated.</p>\n<p>Several groups formed after that meeting, one led by Hal who with Tim Drake, Kara Zor-El, J'onn Jonzz, Raven, Arthur Curry and half a dozen others were trying to figure out what species the boy was (general theory being was he was half ecto-entity but not half human and the kid just wasn't aware of that fact) or if ecto-entites had a moshpit of different super powers, dragging others in their theorizing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another group led jointly by Barry and Bruce that consist mostly of speedster and bats were trying to create a proper suit for Danny but were divided on giving him a whole new super hero ego or something that could be worn under his cosplays so he could keep his theme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oliver was leading one with Diana over coming up with a proper work out and training schedule, Jason Todd volunteering to teach him guns with Roy Harper telling Oliver he was going to help the kid perfect his archery skills, Artemis offering sword lessons with Bizarro cheerfully saying he could teach the kid hand-to-hand.</p>\n<p>Clark was firmly in charge with coming up with a dietary plan for Danny because the only thing that was unanimous when it came to the kid was that he needed to eat way more.</p>\n<p>Constantine volunteered Zatanna to train the kid in proper magic since the kid apparently gave off \"Big Dick Demon Energy\" and the Hellblazer was not going near that kid again if he could help it. Marvel did volunteer to help train him already and he and Danny met up every other week for practice.</p>\n<p>This led to Diana, J'onn and Marvel categorically refusing to give anyone the kid's number.</p>\n<p>Then Patrick O'Brian asked if they knew for sure if the kid's powers were just vast and various due to nonhuman ancestry or if he was a alien meta hybrid whose powers were obtaining the same powers of those he dressed as.</p>\n<p>This led to a near all out civil war between the factions and only just stopped before blood was shed after Jarro called Alfred and the Kents to scold everyone.</p>\n<p>After that it became a game to be the first to get Danny to join them first, a score board going up of how good his terrible cosplaying was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then everything changed when Darkseid attacked.</p>\n<p>Danny knew his time was almost up.</p>\n<p>Clockwork sent him a note telling him he had two hours left before he went back home.</p>\n<p>He was sad to go but he missed home. He was fairly certain he could return in the future, probably could bribe Speed Force to convince Clockwork.</p>\n<p>He thought about saying goodbye but two hours wasn't enough time even with his borrowed speedster ability.</p>\n<p>Billy (because Danny could clock a teenager pretending he was a ancient and powerful hero any day, like seriously, Danny did that back home) had given him the phone numbers of every hero and vigilante he knew in the Justice League and it's various offshoots, just in case he needed them.</p>\n<p>Danny had never used any of them because some of those guys made Tucker look like a newbie when it came to hacking but kept them just in case.</p>\n<p>He decided since he couldn't go say his goodbyes that he'll text it, hoping they didn't feel offended over his lackluster farewell.</p>\n<p>He had just sent the text out and was planning to go into space to drift near the moon when he felt a familar tug on his core of a city spirit trying to get his attention.</p>\n<p>And it was a harsh frantic tug too, which was why he followed it.</p>\n<p>He almost about faced and left when he realized it was Gotham but stayed at the fearful expression on the spirit's gaunt face.</p>\n<p>The spirit spoke before he could ask what the problem was.</p>\n<p>\"Metropolis is under attack!\"</p>\n<p>Danny frowned at that, folding his arms. \"Isn't she like, always dealing with attacks?\"</p>\n<p>\"This is different! This is one of those damn space invasion attacks!\"</p>\n<p>Gotham gave him a pleading look, eyes shining red.</p>\n<p>\"Please! Help her! Darkseid's attacks are always worse because of how much damage he inflicts! The last time he was here she nearly crumbled into nothing!\" He begged, literal tears in his crazed eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A shrill ghostly piercing scream filled the air, full of pain like someone whose leg had been forcibly snapped, a sobbing wail of pure agony rending the air from Metropolis city and Gotham dropped to his knees.</p>\n<p>\"Please! She's-she's my <em>friend</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Danny never could say no to helping others.</p>\n<p>\"Get up. I need a direct access to every thrift shop possible and nothing stopping me from force speeding over there. I need all this in five minutes.\"</p>\n<p>Gotham looked both grateful and determined, his form growing as sharp jagged teeth filled his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I can give you that in three.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good, because I got a lot of people to cosplay as.\" Danny informed him, deciding now was the best time to see what his maximum number for creating doppelgangers was.</p>\n<p>Turns out the answer is: <em>All of them</em>. With extra.</p>\n<p>Patrick O'Brian, better known to the public as Plastic Man, was fairly certain the blow to his head has given him a concussion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Metropolis was either on fire or pulverized, heroes arriving as fast as they were able to aide where they could.</p>\n<p>Yet Darkseid was winning, having successfully incapacitate the big hitters.</p>\n<p>Patrick himself had gotten hit hard and almost set on fire, vision seeing double--</p>\n<p>\"HALT EVIL DOER!\" Came a familiar battle cry, but it sounded like a massive echo spoken from all over the place.</p>\n<p>Patrick looked around and <em>swore</em> his concussion could not be <em>this</em> bad.</p>\n<p>Because he swears he can see a literal army of Cosplay Men, all decked out in the silliest and most poorly made mockeries of everyone present (and a lot of those that weren't here).</p>\n<p>Even Darkseid had stopped to stare in confusion at the spectacle before him, a expression that only got more confused when they all rattled off various catchphrases of who ever they were cosplaying as, a hive of noises as they overlapped each other.</p>\n<p>Then six Superman and five Superboy cosplayers rushed forward and started beating the absolute shit out of Darkseid, like a live action pinball machine.</p>\n<p>The rest began rushing around, getting the evac done swiftly, reinforcing buildings that looked ready to fall, performing first aide and reporting to other heroes for anything and everything.</p>\n<p>There were eight Batman's aiding in the evac and about three times as many Gotham vigilantes helping, four Wonder Women rushed off to aide the Super's in the beating of Darkseid, ten Green Lanterns were moving debris, a dozen Aquamen who were putting out fires, so freakin' many Green Arrows and Captian Marvels acting as defense, a bunch of Zatanna's and Constantine's performing healings and a whole legion of speedsters was moving people to safety.</p>\n<p>And that was just the ones he could see through his blurring vision and knew it was barely half of the Cosplayer Army, everyone else seemed to be beating Darkseid's forces like they were a bunch of cheap drums.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a couple of speedster were next to him, lifting him up and moving fast until he was at a makeshift tent where others were, a Green Lantern holding a barrier over them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were civilian nurses giving the cosplayers a rundown on first aide, a few doctors showing others how to correctly set bones and other injuries.</p>\n<p>Patrick just wanted to sleep but had to stay awake, sleeping with a concussion was bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of the Robin-dressed cosplayers was fussing over him, even as everyone kept looking to where Darkseid was trying and failing to fight off his assailants.</p>\n<p>Then Darkseid let out a high pitched squeal that echoed across the battlefield when one of the Superman cosplayers delivered a kick that had made a audible noise right into the wedding tackle (which considering they were not close to that fight, was both impressive and caused unwanted sympathy pain in all people present), followed up by a punch that shattered his jaw.</p>\n<p>The fight ended pretty much right after that.</p>\n<p>Patrick moved away from the tent, letting one of the cosplay-Robins follow him as he got closer.</p>\n<p>When he got closer it was to see the real Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman having gotten ahold of Darkseid, who did not resist as he was very much unconscious which allowed for a easy capture.</p>\n<p>He looked go his chaperone and smiled at them.</p>\n<p>\"You are all the same person?\" He asked, getting a corny pose and a thumb up. \"Then let me say this before I forget: Danny, thank you. Thank you so much.\"</p>\n<p>The cosplayer smiled, looking touched... when suddenly they turned into goo and clothing.</p>\n<p>He reached out to help when the goo began flying at Mach speed towards one of the Superman cosplayers that was doubled over, slapping into him before it appeared to get absorbed.</p>\n<p>Suddenly all around, cosplayers reduced to slime and goo, flopping around in the clothes until shooting towards the Superman cosplayer.</p>\n<p>The kid fell over from the sheer number of goops slapping into him, writhing in pain as he absorbed the blobs.</p>\n<p>Many people were shouting and running, trying to help him but couldn't do much as the globs seem to be incorporeal to everyone but Danny.</p>\n<p>Finally after what felt like forever but was probably closer to five minutes the blob-goo-things had finally stopped their assault, though that was mainly due to the kid having consumed them all.</p>\n<p>The kid staggered back to his feet, ripping his Superman mask off to dry heave and... <em>oh</em>.</p>\n<p>Patrick and pretty much everyone else in the League (with the few exceptions like Diana, J'onn and Marvel) have never seen the kid's face. Ever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But now, after months of trying to sneakily look at his face the kid just revealed it without issue, revealing a young face of a boy who looked worn out yet glad no one was dead</p>\n<p>Patrick made a conscious choice right then and there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Patrick was absolutely willing to fight the Justice League Trinity, three on one and not in his favor for the right to adopt him.</p>\n<p><em>Note to self: reabsorbing doppelgangers in large quantity hurts like a bitch. </em>Danny noted, wheezing. <em>Next time just do them one at a time.</em></p>\n<p>Looking around he could see a lot of people staring at him in concern, some clearly having stopped themselves from rushing over to him.</p>\n<p>Before he could reassure them a loud clock chime rang out, vibrating through him.</p>\n<p>\"Oh. Already?\" He said to himself, twisting to look at the ground beneath him where Clocky's essence gathering at.</p>\n<p>A massive portal popped into existance under his feet, swirling ecto green as he sank in.</p>\n<p>\"Danny!\"</p>\n<p>\"Cosplay Man!\"</p>\n<p>He waved his hands quickly, hoping to stall them for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay! It's just my time to go!\" He called out, smiling even as people shouted.</p>\n<p>He was sinking fast and only had a small amount if time to say his goodbyes and decided to go with the one he felt would cause the least amount of concern.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you all for making my time here a wonderful experience. Goodbye, random citizens.\"</p>\n<p>Then he was dropped into Clockwork's ever familar tower, the Ancient smiling at him.</p>\n<p>\"Hello Daniel, enjoy your vacation?\"</p>\n<p>\"Dude, you couldn't wait for me to give proper goodbyes?\"</p>\n<p>\"They would have asked awkward questions, so I thought I'd delay it. But you hadn't answered my question.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was great! I learned so much and made some great friends.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad--\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey did you get attacked or something? You got a massive bruise on... your... neck.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, you seem to alright, no point in delaying your return home--\"</p>\n<p>\"Holy <em>shit</em> did you and Speed Force <em>tangle tails</em>?!\"</p>\n<p>\"-- and everyone has missed you, so off you go!\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Waityoudidn'tanswermyquestion</em>--\" And suddenly Danny found himself falling flat on his face on the floor in his parent's lab.</p>\n<p>\"I'll get answers next time. Or visit Speed Force, they are absolutely the kind to kiss and tell.\"</p>\n<p>He did feel bad for his lackluster goodbyes, but immediately brighten when he recalled he had everyone's phone numbers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded to himself in satisfaction only to pull out his phone and realize it apparently broke when the guy attacking Metropolis got a lucky hit in.</p>\n<p>Oh well, at least his new friends knew he was okay.</p>\n<p>\"Danny has been kidnapped, possibly by his maybe-gene donor who is stranger danger incarnate and has, at best attacked him multiple times, or at worse attacked, cloned and sexually assaulted him.\" Hal solemnly informed, pointing to the six boards shoved together in order to properly see all the stuff everyone had gathered on Cosplay Man from his actions and concerning things he has said.</p>\n<p>The factions were all united under one banner: save Cosplay Man.</p>\n<p>\"As the Infinite Realm is, you guessed it, infinite so normal search parties are not going to work. We may need to-- <em>the fuck!</em>?\"</p>\n<p>Everyone reacted to the sudden massive sticky note that appeared in a blink on the conference table by nearly destroying it but thankfully they were better about not attacking things that randomly show up.</p>\n<p>Bruce, the only one not to react to the sudden appearence of a giant sticky note that took up half the table, leaned forward to read.</p>\n<p>\"'Daniel's home dimension coordinates'? And what appears to be... 'Instructions for idiot's guide on dimensional portal making'.\"</p>\n<p>For a moment there was silence as they took in what this meant.</p>\n<p>Then Caprian Marvel very calmly held his hand out to Constantine who groaned loudly but handed him money.</p>\n<p>\"Of course the little shit was from another dimension...\" the Hellblazer whined, and suddenly Raven was making off like a bandit with the sheer number of people who bet Danny was from their earth despite the fact Danny had claimed to be from the Infinite Realms.</p>\n<p>It took three days to test and make sure there was no traps as Marvel had attested that it came from Danny's ghost guardian, then a month to create the portal.</p>\n<p>A lot of people were rather concern how easy it was to create a portal to another reality.</p>\n<p>But soon it was running, the tests to make sure it was stable and took them to where they wanted to go completed.</p>\n<p>Really, the part that took the longest to decide was who was coming.</p>\n<p>In the end they had to make a raffle and choose from there.</p>\n<p>Bruce, Diana, Clark, Bart, Oliver, Hal, Marvel, Dick, Jason, Tim, Stephanie, Connor, Wally, Bart, Patrick, Zatanna, Kaldur'ahm, Artemis, Bizarro and Raven were finally selected and a week after the raffle they proceeded to enter the portal.</p>\n<p>To everyone's surprise, it sent them to a rural little town.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They scouted, finding it very normal and were ready to go back and recheck for errors when one of the Gothamites found Danny.</p>\n<p>To everyone's bafflement he seemed to be living a normal life and not in any kind of trouble at all.</p>\n<p>They decided to stay hidden and observe.</p>\n<p>And week later had several people already trying to justify kidnapping while many others were more amused that the kid was a hero in this dimension though the amusement was tempered by the lack of mentors.</p>\n<p>Marvel had suggested that perhaps Danny had been studying them, an assessment that seemed very viable after witnessing him incorporate their moves and techniques.</p>\n<p>They also observed the towns people, who seemed to love Danny though some saw him as a ruffian that caused problems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And after stalking the other Fentons they could safely say the parents loved their kid (though they did discovered that they use to hunt their kid until he revealed himself, which made some want to post some kind of watch on them just to be sure this wasn't them trying to get their son to drop his guard), and the members that made up the Outlaws were very much trying to figure out how to recruit Jasmine Fenton and the Young Justice members were debating the best way to convince Dani Fenton to join them after the respective sister beat up members of those groups after somehow figuring out they were being followed.</p>\n<p>They were making plans on how to make contact when Wally informed them that Danny was getting his butt kicked by Vlad Masters, aka Fruitloop, aka Mr. Should-not-be-allowed-near-children-or-married-women, aka The Guy everyone wanted to beat the shit out of.</p>\n<p>Superman had started to make a plan of a attack when Barry with Wally and Bart ran off and returned a minute latter, arms loaded with various items including the Fenton belts that prevented possession along with Fenton weaponry, the trio sporting matching shit eating grins.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, who wants to troll a ghost?\"</p>\n<p>Danny wanted another vacation so badly.</p>\n<p>Don't get him wrong, he was happy to be home and to see his family and friends.</p>\n<p>But he swears that first month back all his rogues had decided to double book their attacks or something.</p>\n<p>He had to sit them down and explain that while he was glad to see them, there are other ways to show him they missed him.</p>\n<p>It went a slightly less hectic after that, though he was more annoyed that while his vacation lasted a year and a half, apparently he had only been gone a summer back home.</p>\n<p>Clockwork latter visited and explain he cashed in some favors to slow down his dimension so that he wouldn't miss too much, but that both his and the world he visited were back on normal time, which he was glad for.</p>\n<p>But it meant he had improved by leaps and bounds whereas Val and his friends had not, meaning Val had asked for training so she could keel up and the others were practically hounding him about the other world.</p>\n<p>All in all, he was happy to be home but he kinda missed being able to run amok with no responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Then Vlad returned and said his typical greeting via assault when Danny wasn't aware he wasn't alone anymore and because Vlad was a asshole, he hit him with a bastardized cattle prod.</p>\n<p>So Danny was struggling to dodge while Vlad would not shut up and he really wished he had back up--</p>\n<p>And then a cacophony of voices bellowed out, causing both him and Fruitloop to stop their fight.</p>\n<p>\"HALT EVIL DOER!\"</p>\n<p>He turned, wondering what the hell he heard when a sputtered noise escaped him that had nothing to do with the fact he felt crispy.</p>\n<p>His hero friends stood not far from them, all wearing thick covering over their bodies. Before he could demand why they were here they all yelled, off key and not in tune with anyone else as they dropped they coverings, \"I'M GOING GHOST!\"</p>\n<p>Danny was rendered speechless at the sight before him.</p>\n<p>There stood dozens of his friends from the other dimension dressed in the shittiest, cheapest and most brilliant cosplay of himself he has ever seen.</p>\n<p>He took in the display before him, laughter bubbling up from within him.</p>\n<p>Superman was wearing a pale blonde wig and black overalls over his own suit with a white sheet for a cloak, a cartoony cut out mask of Danny's face firmly placed over his own.</p>\n<p>Diana, as though to mimic his first crappy cosplay of her, was wearing a onesie with his body printed on it, a Phantom mask but with lipstick on, a clean white mop head plopped on top of her still very visible black locks, her tiara sticking out through as she wore white opera gloves and muddy rainboots.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman had a white wig over his cowl, a black cat adult onesie with white dish washer gloves on and his stylized emblem taped to the front.</p>\n<p>The first Green Lantern he met, Hal, was wearing off white viper pit sunglasses over his own mask and a black bathrobe with a white sash holding it in place and a white baseball cap on.</p>\n<p>The Flash was wearing a black trench coat, a white see through shower cap over his cowl, and white polka dot spats over his vividly yellow boots.</p>\n<p>The Green Arrow was dressed in grey waders, fingerless gloves that were a pale yellow and a single clip-on piece of white hair accessory attached to the side of his hood.</p>\n<p>There were others, one of the Super Boys, a couple of other speedsters, a bunch of Gothamite vigilantes and many others but Danny could barely make out anyone else from how hard he was laughing.</p>\n<p>\"Wowzers! Is that our creepy nemesis, Phantom: Wonder Woman Edition?\" Superman exclaimed in the funniest Mickey Mouse voice Danny has ever heard.</p>\n<p>\"Daniel, who are these people--\"</p>\n<p>Wonder Woman cut him off by pointing dramatically at Vlad and gasping in nasally voice. \"Why yes Phantom: Superman Edition, it is! It's the Freaky Floundering Feckless Fruitloop!\"</p>\n<p>\"What!\" Vlad snarled but got steamrolled by Green Arrow who spoke with a bad Sean Connery accent.</p>\n<p>\"We should get rid of this guy before he targets other teenagers with his unwanted attention towards their mothers and themselves.\"</p>\n<p>Danny was gasping with how hard he was laughing, Vlad shaking with offended rage.</p>\n<p>And then Danny nearly laughed himself into a coma when Batman very dramatically said,</p>\n<p>\"Make witty play on words.\"</p>\n<p>\"Keen observation, Phantom: Batman Edition!\" The Flash proclaimed in a accent that sounded like it belonged to Gilbert Gottfried. \"We'll take care of this creeper post haste!\"</p>\n<p>\"Reply with puntastic rejoiner.\" Batman loudly stated, a smile threatening to crack across his face as Danny was reduced to wheezing.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I couldn't agree more!\" Superman's Mickey Mouse voice said cheerfully, cracking his knuckles. \"Let's soup him.\"</p>\n<p>He could honestly say he could not watch the ass kicking they delivered upon Vlad as he was too busy trying to breath (which considering he really didn't need to breath while in ghost mode said a lot about how hard he was laughing).</p>\n<p>He had no idea where they got a thermos from, but they made short work of Vlad who was a giant bruise after getting his butt soundly handed to him.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Billy, still dressed like Captian Marval but with a baggy black moomoo over his suit and a Frosty the Snowman cap on his head, smirked at him and asked,</p>\n<p>\"Are you alright, Random Citizen?\"</p>\n<p>It took Danny half an hour to stop laughing.</p>\n<p>A hour latter would see the Nasty Burger flooded with weirdos in badly done Phantom costumes over their other costumes, with the Ghost hero himself fluttering between them all with the brightest smile on his face as he spoke cheerfully to these adults.</p>\n<p>His friends and family would be cautiously happy for him, glad to see that his friends from his vacation had decided to visit.</p>\n<p>Though Amity Park's hero would try escaping through the floor when pictures of his cosplays began to make rounds, his family, friends and rogue gallery (who had arrived thinking they had to rescue their rival-friend-king from a bunch of weirdos and were glad he was safe) kept him from running as they regaled the visitors of Danny's many battles and general teenage stupidity.</p>\n<p>Amity Park would end up the vacation spot for many heroes, vigilantes and even the occasional villain, everyone having agreed that having a place they could unwind was a good idea.</p>\n<p>And if they spent a large chunk of said vacation badly impersonating Phantom (and Red Huntress once she gave the okay), well, that was just a bit of harmless fun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
