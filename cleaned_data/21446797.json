    "text": "It started with a phone call, a call that set off alarm bells with the newly pardoned Avengers, not that Tony would know for quite some time.\nThe Avengers (both remaining and Rogues) found them selves altogether in the same room for only the second time since the Rogues had been pardoned. They were in a meeting discussing new training and asset distribution, the conversation stilted by the still present tension between both groups.\nNow, Tony might have been instrumental in the getting them pardoned, but that didn\u2019t mean he forgave any of them, or forgot anything that happened between them. Most of the time he still felt numb over the events of Siberia. He could hardly fathom how one of his best friends, someone he had trusted most in the world, had been capable of leaving him for dead. He couldn\u2019t move on when Rhodey was still in the throes of learning to walk again, with the help of Stark prosthetics. He couldn\u2019t forgive when none of them could see how they had been in the wrong, how they had hurt him.\u00a0\nBut he knew the pardoning was necessary. The world needed the Avengers. All of them. Everything was changing, events were being set in motion and the future needed the Avengers in it to protect it. No matter the personal cost.\u00a0\nBut while he knew the world needed the Avengers, that didn\u2019t mean he did. He had Pepper. And Happy. And Peter. He needed to protect them from whatever the world threw at them, which meant bringing the Avengers back together. It also meant keeping the Rogue Avengers far away from anything to do with Peter.\u00a0\nPeter had partially moved into the Avengers Compound a few months back, after May had spent four consecutive night shifts in the hospital and Peter had nearly bled out on the carpet floor from a stabbing on patrol gone wrong.\u00a0\nTony and May had agreed that they couldn\u2019t let that happen again.\u00a0\nSo they had compromised, May would have weekends and any odd day that she wasn\u2019t on a night shift and Peter would spend the rest of his time at the compund. It was far from ideal, what with the extra travel for school and the added stress of avoiding the Rogues when coming in and out, but Tony had volunteered Happy to drive him to and from school and Peter predominantly stayed within Tony\u2019s wing of the compound so had yet to actually see the other Avengers.\nNed had flipped out when Peter had come into school and whispered to him in Chemistry about the transition. It had resulted in a detention for Peter from Mr Harris but it was worth it.\u00a0\nSo here\u2019s where Tony\u2019s problems began.\u00a0\nHe was sat in amongst the recently pardoned Rogues, the seating arrangement was Pepper\u2019s idea to \u2018foster and re-build old relationships\u2019, so he was currently sat in-between Clint and Steve and opposite Natasha.\u00a0\nRhodey, unfortunately for Tony, had begged off attendance due to physiotherapy and Tony hadn\u2019t wanted to post-pone and bring more attention to the still present consequences of their so-called \u2018Civil War\u2019.\nHis phone vibrated.\u00a0\nThe buzzing interrupted the Clint and Sam\u2019s negotiation of gym and training equipment, causing attention to turn to Tony.\u00a0\n\u201cStark, I thought we booked your valuable time,\u201d Sam huffed, jokingly. \u201cI mean, it only took us two weeks.\u201d\u00a0\nTony glanced at the Number ID to see Peter\u2019s smiling face flashing from his home screen. He immediately felt concerned, checking his watch, he confirmed that it was only 14:30pm. Shouldn\u2019t Peter be at school?\nWorried, Tony moved to rise from his seat and answer, the excuse tumbling from his lips, \u201cIt\u2019s work, I\u2019ve got to-\u201c\nSteve questioned, curious but intentionally not accusatory, they were still working to repair old relationships, after all, \u201cTony, why would work be phoning? Pepper organised this meeting for all of us, and anyone else would phone Pepper not you. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cIt, er, it is actually Pepper. Probably an update, or something, I\u2019ve just got to-\u201c\u00a0\nHe pressed accept, still giving the passive \u2018I\u2019ll be just a moment\u2019 spiels to the other Avengers as he left the room.\nAs he exited, he pulled the door closed for privacy.\nThis, however, didn\u2019t stop Steve and Bucky\u2019s super-powered hearing from accidentally overhearing the one-sided conversation.\n\u201cHey, is everything alright?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounded genuinely worried, which piqued their interest, was something wrong with Pepper?\n\n\u201cI thought I said you weren\u2019t supposed to phone when at s-\u201c\n\nSteve and Bucky gave each other confused looks, Why would Tony say Pepper shouldn\u2019t phone him?\n\n\u201cOh, so you won\u2019t be staying here tonight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine! You are still coming over to stay this weekend though, right? Pepper will be in Japan then, so I\u2019ll be by myself.\u201d\n\nThat gained the concern of the two sitting in the conference room; Tony had just told them he\u2019d been talking to Pepper and now he was talking to this unknown person about coming over to stay over when Pepper wasn\u2019t around.\nIt was almost reminiscent of, well, Howard.\nBefore Howard met Maria, he would have several women on the go and lie to them about when and where the others would be. But Tony wouldn\u2019t do that, would he?\nThey exchanged knowing looks, an interaction that wasn\u2019t lost on the other members of the team.\u00a0\nClint kicked them, his head gesturing towards the door. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to something that us mortals can\u2019t hear. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSteve strained to make out more, hushing Clint as he did, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you later, just-\u201c\n\n\u201cGlad you let me know, I\u2019ll see you this weekend.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt was the last part of the exchange that sealed the deal for both super-soldiers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\nTony was having an affair.\n****\nThey were gathered in a coffee shop down the street from the compound, they being: Clint, Steve, Bucky, Wanda, Natasha and Sam.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d\nEach of them turned to look at Clint. His declaration having been the loudest and most vehement.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it is! I don\u2019t believe that after everything, Stark would just go around and cheat on Pepper. The guy has like, what, two friends outside of the Avengers which are Happy and Pepper.\u201d Clint counted the names on two of his fingers, holding them each out as if to make a point. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell us he\u2019s actually cheating on one of the only other people in his life? I\u2019m not his biggest fan but I\u2019m calling bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage.\u201d Natasha chimed in, unhelpfully, earning a glare from the Steve.\u00a0\nSteve responded, firmly denying the accusation. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying he\u2019s definitely cheating-\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard.\u201d Clint chimed.\n\u201c-we\u2019re just telling you what we heard.\u201d\nThere was a moment of uncomfortable silence, as they all pondered what to do with the information. At the end of the day, they all liked Pepper. If the conversation Steve and Bucky had overheard was genuine, then Tony might be cheating on her.\u00a0\nIf that was the case then, what next? Did they tell her and risk any and all progress they\u2019d made re-building their broken friendships? Did they say nothing and become complicit? If Tony truly was cheating on her, maybe he just wasn\u2019t the man or team-mate that they remembered him to be.\u00a0\nNatasha mulled, before breaking the silence. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just do some investigation?\u201d\nAt their blank looks, she elaborated, \u201cIf he\u2019s truly hiding some mystery woman then we\u2019ll find evidence of it. We could always try looking up phone records and find out who he was talking to. Maybe there\u2019s a reasonable explanation.\u201d\n\u201cReasonable explanation for \u2018I love you\u2019?\u201d Sam retorted, emphasising \u2018I love you\u2019 with sarcastic quotation marks.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was Bucky\u2019s turn to be on the receiving end of the groups look.\u00a0\nHe shifted uncomfortably. \u201cPepper was nice to me. Even after everything that happened with Stark, she always asked if I was okay, or if she could do anything to help with my rehabilitation. So I\u2019ll help you. I won\u2019t be part of hiding him cheating on her. I won\u2019t.\u201d\nIf Bucky was in, then Sam was too. From there, it wasn\u2019t too hard from there to convince the others to help. They\u2019d agreed to investigate on a couple of different fronts: they would look into the phone records and any monetary connections that could rule out cheating. They would invite themselves over on the weekend and find the woman at Tony\u2019s, maybe catch him in the act and expose him.\u00a0\nThey, also, agreed not to tell Rhodey or Vision; the Avengers were worried they would tell Tony of their suspicions, or worse, both already knew and didn\u2019t care enough to stop him.\u00a0\n****\nUnaware of the investigation that his actions had started, Tony had been doing his best to do as much as he could to throw the Avengers off the scent for his weekend with Peter. But they seemed only to be getting more and more interested.\n\u201cHey, Tony, what you doing this weekend? We\u2019re planning to get some shawarma, you want to come?\u201d\u00a0\nThe nonchalant question from Natasha had set him on edge. He hoped, vehemently, that she hadn\u2019t noticed.\u00a0\n\u201cEr, well I\u2019ve actually got plans with, um, Rhodey this weekend. But thanks.\u201c Tony lied, unwittingly flagging the attention of the Rogues.\u00a0\n\u201cBoth Saturday and Sunday? All day, both days?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a special weekend. To, um, celebrate 6-months of physio.\u201d\u00a0\nI\u2019m going to Hell. Tony definitely wasn\u2019t proud of that lie, out of all the ones he could have told, but it\u2019d been enough to make the questions awkwardly ebb off.\u00a0\nThe questioning, however, had succeeded in making him more paranoid about keeping Peter hidden.\nHe\u2019d begun to organise events that Peter and he could do outside of the compound. Maybe a trip to Europe would be nice for a weekend? After all, Peter\u2019s only trip outside of the US was to Berlin and look how that\u2019d ended.\u00a0\nNo, that was too flashy. Maybe he could take Peter to that new science exhibit he\u2019d been going on about?\nFrom the closed elevator, as it began to go down a level, oblivious to the eavesdroppers, he phoned Peter. \u201cHow do you feel about going to an exhibit this weekend?\u201d\n****\nIt was a couple of days later on a Friday. And a number of things had become apparent to the Rogue Avengers.\nFirstly, the original phone call wasn\u2019t a one off. On numerous occasions Tony had excused himself for phone calls citing \u2018work\u2019 or \u2018Pepper\u2019 as the excuse, however, the conversations themselves indicated otherwise. The hours of the calls, also, were questionable; they varied from midday, evening and sometimes odd hours of the day or night.\u00a0\nSecondly, Tony always answered. No matter if they were having a team dinner, training or even in his lab, he answered. One time he even answered when Pepper was in the room next door. The audacity of it, indicated to them that it must have been going on long enough that he was becoming lax at hiding it.\u00a0\nUpon reconvening, they each shared their findings.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a potential name.\u201d\nAt this everyone, except Clint, clamoured over to Natasha, each as interested as the next about who might be enough to draw Tony away from Pepper.\u00a0\nSpinning around the laptop, Natasha revealed the picture of a woman. A brunette, in her late forties and a heart-warming smile and naturally very beautiful.\n\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, for a home wrecker.\u201d Clint remarked snidely, \u201cWhat?\u201d He raised his hands apologetically when the others gave him disapproving looks, \u201cCome on, if she\u2019s ruining Tony and Pepper\u2019s relationship, then she is a home-wrecker.\u201d\n\u201cHer name is May Parker,\u201d Natasha continued as though she hadn\u2019t been interrupted, \u201cAnd home-wrecker or not, she and Tony have, according to phone records, been phoning regularly for nearly a year.\u201d\nNatasha clicked onto the next screen and up popped images of May Parker\u2019s phone records and bank statements. Something which, Steve noted, couldn\u2019t have been obtained strictly legally.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been receiving money from him the last three months, as well as so-called \u2018gifts\u2019.\u201d\nBucky spoke up for the first time in the meet-up, \u201cWhat kind of gifts?\u201d\n\u201cWell, so far, from what I can see money. And two sets of new Stark Phones and Phone contracts. And-\u201c She changed slides to show a recent photo from May\u2019s Facebook page,\u201d- jewellery.\u201d\nThe photo showed May smiling at the camera. She was wearing a chained gold-pendant, one which was clearly new and to a trained eye worth far more than most houses in New York cost.\u00a0\n\u201cIt looks like the pendant was a present. She couldn\u2019t have bought it on a nurse\u2019s salary and it doesn\u2019t look like she has anyone else in her life that would be able to afford such a present.\u201d\nTaking over from Natasha, Clint pressed the \u2018next\u2019 button. It was seamless enough that Sam actually wondered if they\u2019d practiced the presentation. \u201cNatasha gave me the name a couple of days ago and I\u2019ve done some research of my own. I have been watching the Parker home from a nearby roof the past few days.\u201d\u00a0\nHe pointed out a photo of the Parker home, with Tony\u2019s car out front, it was fairly obvious that despite the extravagance of the car compared to those around it, the car had been chosen as one of Tony\u2019s \u2018incognito\u2019 cars. It was less flashy than those he normally drove in.\u00a0\n\u201cThis was taken two days ago. Tony left the compound about midnight on Wednesday.\u201d The slide he\u2019d chosen showed May Parker answering the door, casting a furtive look around, before closing the door. \u201cHe, er, stayed for a couple of hours and then came back home.\u201d\nThis new revelation didn\u2019t look good for Tony. They all knew it, but none would come out and say it. It was pretty damning evidence.\nNatasha followed on, the next slide showing traffic camera footage. \u201cFrom what I can gather, he has been to her house at random times of the day or night for nearly a year. Often times it\u2019s when Pepper has been away, sometimes she hasn\u2019t been. It\u2019s to the point where, I think even her nephew has gotten to know Tony.\u201d\n\u201cNephew?\u201d\u00a0\nSam questioned, looking at the new photo showing a teenage boy answering the house door and being completely unfazed to see the Tony Stark on his doorstep.\u00a0\nAnswering his question, Natasha said, \u201cNephew, one Peter Parker. He\u2019s 15 years old. Was taken in by Ben and May Parker after his parents died in a plane crash. May\u2019s husband, Ben, died a few years back during a robbery gone wrong, the poor kid apparently saw everything.\u201d\n\u201cShit, that\u2019s rough.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sam shared Clint\u2019s sentiments, but tried to avoid being derailed. \u201cBut if even the kid isn\u2019t surprised Tony\u2019s there, then this is worse than we thought.\u201d\nSteve interjected, wanting to offer any potential alternative information that could refute the growing evidence against Tony. \u201cLook, they could just be friends, good friends. Maybe it was a birthday present. And maybe they just talk so much for a number of different reasons. We don\u2019t know anything for certain.\u201d\nHe closed the laptop Natasha had open, not wanting to see any more against Tony.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Wanda started, \u201cYou were the one who thought this to start with. Is there really anything that just been shown that proves otherwise?\u201d\nSteve shook his head, wearily, and moved to sit down.\u00a0\nHe rubbed his temples, trying to fight the growing migraine. He hadn\u2019t wanted this to be true. In fact, he\u2019d mentioned it to his team with the hope that they would be able to provide an alternative explanation, anything that would explain it.\n\u201cHey, man, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Sam had sat down beside him, settling a hand on his shoulder comfortingly. \u201cLook. It\u2019s Friday, right? Well, if Tony is really having someone round and cheating then all we\u2019ll have to do is find a reason to get into his personal rooms and find them. We\u2019ll find out the truth.\u201d\nAll this running around behind Tony\u2019s back was hardly fostering a new found trust, but if this was the only way they\u2019d be able to find out once and for all if Tony was cheating, then this was what they\u2019d do.\n****\nTony was excited.\u00a0\nThe weekend had arrived and he was, finally, going to see Peter again.\u00a0\nIt had surprised him, the last few days of solitude, how much he had grown used to Peter\u2019s presence. When Peter had moved in, he had worried it would be too much; that he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it or wouldn\u2019t be as good as Peter\u2019s Aunt at looking after him.\u00a0\nBut he needn\u2019t have worried, looking after Peter had become as easy as breathing. It was something he looked forward to, something that got him out of bed in the morning. Not that Pepper didn\u2019t. But Peter had given him a new sense of purpose; he was more driven at work (super hero and otherwise), it was all done with the purpose of giving Peter a legacy.\u00a0\nSo yes, Tony might say he was excited. He was made even more excited by the news that May had got the Friday and Saturday off and would be deigning to join them for a family night. Peter was thrilled by the idea.\u00a0\nThe moment Happy pulled up, into Tony\u2019s private garage, the car door was flung open and Tony found himself with an armful of teenager.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, kiddo!\u201d\u00a0\nPeter pulled back, smiling happily at Tony. \u201cHey, Tony.\u201d\nThey had finally moved on from the \u2018Mr Stark\u2019 phase, though it had taken some time. Tony was glad for it. But in the long run, he was hoping for a more permanent change, one that he was going to need May\u2019s blessing for. Dad.\n\u201cTony Stark, are you going to help with all these bags?\u201d\u00a0\nRuffling Peter\u2019s hair, he moved around to give May a hug. \u201cGood to see you too, May.\u201d\nPlayfully huffing, May returned the hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long. I hope Peter has been behaving himself when he\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\u201cHe never does anything else.\u201d\nTony moved away from the hug, only to turn to Happy. Happy gave him an unimpressed look. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not hugging you.\u201d\nLaughing, Tony reached to grab a couple of the bags from the trunk and lift them inside. He was sure he\u2019d built robots to do exactly this, but he didn\u2019t know where in his labs those would be.\u00a0\nThey carried the bags and Peter\u2019s books into Tony\u2019s personal living area.\u00a0\nPeter immediately went to dump his bags in his room, while Tony showed May to one of the spare rooms down the hall.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s about 5 O\u2019Clock now... I can order us some pizza and we\u2019ve got a selection of films to watch. Peter wanted a family movie marathon. Is that good?\u201d\nMay smiled, \u201cSounds wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cGood. We\u2019ve got a science exhibit tomorrow, I booked out the entire place for us.\u201d\nPeter squealed from his room in excitement, shouting to Tony about how amazing it was going to be. May rolled her eyes at the enthusiasm. She couldn\u2019t quite remember the last time she felt this content, this happy. It had certainly been a long time.\u00a0\nNow she was so happy, she could burst, and it was all because of Peter. Peter and Tony. As she watched them talk science to each other, she found herself eternally grateful that Peter had found someone who encouraged his interests, someone who looked after him when she couldn\u2019t, someone who love him like she did. Someone who was like a father to him.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what she saw when she looked at Tony and Peter. A Father and Son.\n****\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s settled?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Natasha still has clearance to get into Tony\u2019s personal living areas, in case of emergencies. So Saturday morning, we\u2019re going in. We\u2019re going to find out what\u2019s really going on, once and for all.\u201d\n****\nMay awoke early, to an empty household; her work as a nurse meant she wasn\u2019t really able to stay in bed longer than 8 hours without a large amount of anxiety, while Peter was a teenager and didn\u2019t get up before midday on a weekend - other than to patrol or go to Ned\u2019s - and Tony had such an odd sleep schedule, May was unsure if he ever slept at all.\u00a0\nAs a result, May found herself alone, in her pyjamas, pouring herself a bowl of cereal in Tony\u2019s personal kitchen that Saturday morning when the elevator let out a loud \u2018ding\u2019.\u00a0\nCompletely blindsided, May could do little more than drop her spoon before virtually all the Avengers came out of the elevator at once.\u00a0\nMay immediately stood up.\nThe Avengers looked a mixture of livid, upset and disappointed at seeing her. Considering she\u2019d never met any of the Avengers before, she had no idea why they were looking at her like that, but she didn\u2019t plan on finding out.\u00a0\n\u201cTony!\u201d May shouted out towards Tony\u2019s room, hoping that her voice or Friday would help wake him up.\u00a0\n\u201cYou must be May Parker.\u201d Bucky looked up her and down, unimpressed.\u00a0\n\u201cHow do you kno-?!\u201d\nHer question was interrupted by Tony sprinting into the kitchen, his suit already half forming around his pyjamas. \u201cMay, are you alr-?!\u201d\nStumbling after him, was a disheveled Peter, who also looked panicked at his Aunt\u2019s shouting. \u201cAunt May?!\u201d\nThey both came clattering to a halt, seeing the half assembled Avengers Team in front of them.\u00a0\nThere was a beat of silence.\nSteve, taking charge, spoke first. \u201cTony, what is going on here?\u201d\nTrying to act nonchalant, Tony responded, \u201cHey, Cap. What brings you to my humble abode?\u201d\u00a0\nThe look was ruined slightly by the clanging of his armour as a metal pad from his repulser fell uselessly to the floor.\u00a0\n\u201cI stood up for you!\u201d Clint, unable to take the awkward tension and having grown angrier by the second at Tony\u2019s attempt at feigning ignorance, blurted out. \u201cI told them that you wouldn\u2019t be doing this and yet here you are!\u201d\nTony felt fear seep through his bones; they had finally found out about Peter, about Spider-Man, he hadn\u2019t done enough to protect him and now the Rogues were rightly angry at him for bring a child to a battleground.\u00a0If he was them, he would be too.\nHe raised his hands, placatingly. \u201cLook, I know I should have told you and I know it was wrong but I was trying to do the right thing.\u201d\nBucky chipped in, looking murderous, \u201cHow could you lie like that?!\u00a0 Go behind everyone\u2019s backs, behind Pepper\u2019s back, and do this?!\u201d\n\u201cTo start with, Pepper didn\u2019t know but she does now, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell us that Pepper is okay that you\u2019re cheating on her. That\u2019s some bull, right there!\u201d\n\u201cWha-?\u201d Now Tony was confused, what were they talking about? \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nMay, who had moved to stand beside Peter, shielding him from sight, looked at the scene in front of her and suddenly it clicked. They had become angry when they had seen her there, standing in the kitchen in her pyjamas. They weren\u2019t angry about Peter, or Spider-Man, they were angry about her.\n\u201cTony, I think... I think they think we\u2019re having an affair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Both Peter and Tony turned to stare incredulously at May, dumbfounded.\u00a0For geniuses, they both were incredibly dense sometimes.\nThe Rogues gave each other confused looks. They were a lot less confident, and angry, than they were a few seconds before. If Tony wasn\u2019t having an affair, then what on Earth was going on?\nBeing the chosen scapegoat, Steve hesitantly asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d\nImmediately, Tony started laughing. The kind of laugh that has you doubling-over, clutching your stomach. It was actually more painful than he remembered. He looked over at Peter to see the disgusted look on his face and creased up again.\u00a0\nMay took over, clearly Tony wasn\u2019t in a fit state to reply just yet. \u201cTony and I aren\u2019t having an affair. Why would you have thought that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the fact that he\u2019s been contacting you and visiting your house on a bi-weekly basis for the last year? Or the fact that he\u2019s been sending money and gifts to you? Or, the fact that you are in his personal quarters\u00a0having spent the night here while Pepper is gone and Tony lied about it?!\u201d Clint\u2019s diatribe picked up speed towards the end, but the speech seemed to have got through to Tony, as he\u2019d stopped laughing and seemed a little more somber than when they\u2019d first started out.\u00a0\n\u201cWait.\u201d Bucky, couldn\u2019t help but voice everyone else\u2019s confusion, along with his own. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t having an affair, how do you know each other? What is she doing here? What is the kid doing here? And what were you apologising for lying to us about?!\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s attention turned back to May, Tony and Peter.\u00a0\nTony\u2019s mouth was open, but he was frozen and no sound was coming out. It was like he didn\u2019t know what to say, or do.\n\u201cHe-He was lying about me.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice came out small and quiet.\u00a0\nWith all the Avengers attention on him he felt small. He could normally brave it out, when in his suit; he could blind them with cool tricks and fast words, but here, in his Hello Kitty pyjamas, and bare face he felt frightened.\n\u201cPete, no, it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to say anything. It\u2019s none of their business.\u201d Tony turned to look at Peter and hated how meek he looked. He placed his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders, ignoring the Avengers behind him, and spoke quietly to Peter, even though he knew the others could here him.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t ready, we don\u2019t have to tell anyone anything, okay kiddo? Why don\u2019t you go get dressed? Your Aunt and I will be in in a minute and we can all go out to the exhibit like we planned, okay?\u201d\nThrough his talk with Peter, the Avengers were examining their interaction, fascinated. They had never seen Tony act so patient or caring towards someone other than Pepper or Rhodey. He was acting maturely and.. maybe even fatherly.\nAfter an encouraging nod from May, Peter trailed hesitantly towards his room.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\nIgnoring Clint, May and Tony had a silent communication. They had discussed telling the other Avengers before, when they had first been moving into the Compound, but decided against it; May didn\u2019t trust them. They had, also, considered the Personal Intern route, like before, but didn\u2019t know how to explain that whole \u2018Intern living in Tony\u2019s personal quarters\u2019 thing. They hadn\u2019t got any further than that, but from May\u2019s expression he knew she was about to give her own excuse, he just didn\u2019t know what.\u00a0\nHer expression said \u2018trust me\u2019 and he did, so he nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cTony knew my sister-in-law, Mary. He knew her fifteen years ago, before she died. Last year, Tony found out about Peter and reached out. He offered money and gifts, he visits a lot and invites us over because... because Peter is his son.\u201d\nJaws dropped around them, disbelief across their features, Tony only hoped his own face didn\u2019t reflect their expressions. He looked at May, searchingly, asking her non-verbally,\u00a0\u2018are you sure you want to do this?\u2019\u00a0\nMay smiled at him, it was hardly a lie. It was just a stretching of the truth, a truth that the other Rogues had no right to either way.\nTony felt a mixture of fear, excitement, pride and love well-up in him.\u00a0\n\nI guess I\u2019m a dad now.\u00a0\n\nHe wondered to himself how Peter would take the news.\nPeter was sat in his room.\u00a0\nHe was supposed to be changing from his Hello Kitty pyjamas, but instead he was sat dumbfounded on his bed, reeling from what he\u2019d just heard.\u00a0\nHe doubted anyone in the kitchen, including Tony, knew or remembered his super-powered hearing, so they wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019d heard them. Yet.\nMay had just told all the Avengers that he was Tony\u2019s son. Him. There had been no wavering or hesitance; she stated it like it was a fact.\u00a0\nWorryingly, he hadn\u2019t heard Tony respond, he had only heard the uproars that sounded immediately after the announcement. So he didn\u2019t know what Tony\u2019s reaction was. Would he be upset that May just foisted a pretend son on him or would he be happy to claim a relationship like that with Peter?\nPeter hoped the latter. After all, they had been spending so much time together recently that it almost seemed like that might be what Tony wanted. But that could just be Peter reflecting him own emotions on Tony. And then, if he did accept that relationship, what would they do when it inevitably came out? Or if the Parker luck hit again? Peter couldn\u2019t bare to loose another parent or guardian, not May and especially not Tony.\u00a0\nHe heard shouting, lots of shouting. He could make out Tony\u2019s voice, but couldn\u2019t concentrate enough to distinguish what was being said. Tony just sounded angry.\u00a0\nFinally, there was silence.\u00a0\nDistantly, he could hear the muffled voices of Aunt May and Tony. They were getting closer.\u00a0\nThere was a knock on the door.\u00a0\nPeter wondered vaguely how long he\u2019d been sat on his bed.\u00a0\n\u201cHey kiddo, can I come in?\u201d Tony sounded calm, but after all the shouting Peter had heard he didn\u2019t know if it was put-on or not.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter curled up, wrapping his arms around his pillow for comfort.\u00a0\nTony opened the door slowly, seemingly unsurprised to see Peter still unchanged and curled up on his bed.\u00a0\n\u201cHow much of that did you hear?\u201d\n\u201cSome. May-You-Both of you told them I was your son.\u201d Peter refused to look at Tony.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t know what would happen if he did. Maybe he would see Tony\u2019s expression of laughter, as if they\u2019d pulled a joke on the Avengers and it would all be one great laugh. If that happened, he didn\u2019t think he could share the amusement; he couldn\u2019t go through the motions of pretending to have a father when secretly all he wanted was for that to actually be true.\u00a0\nIn the doorway of Peter\u2019s bedroom, Tony debated what to respond.\u00a0\nHe could say that he agreed with May because it would keep Peter\u2019s identity hidden. He could say that that was all there was to it, but that wouldn\u2019t be the truth and Peter deserved better. He agreed because he wanted Peter to be his son. After all the betrayals he\u2019d had in his life; his father, Obadiah, Steve, he needed something stable in his life. He wanted that to be Peter. And he didn\u2019t want to hide that from Peter, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to either of them. So, he was going to tell Peter the truth about why he agreed with May and just hope that Peter felt the same way.\nTony edged towards the bed to sit beside Peter, moving the newest Lego Death Star model over to make room.\n\u201cPeter, I don\u2019t want you to think that I\u2019m trying to replace your parents, or Ben. But when May said that, when I confirmed it, I wasn\u2019t just saying it to keep your identity secret.\u201d Tony waited a moment, hoping Peter would raise his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, I said it because I would love nothing more than to claim you as my son. I spoke with May after those little shits-\u201d Peter giggled at the language despite himself, \u201d-left and she gave her permission. So, if you want to, and only if you want to, would you like to become my son?\u201d\nPeter felt his world stop. Is this real? Tony Stark wants him to be his son?!\n\u201c-Peter?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0\nThe question was out of his lips before his brain could catch up with him. He felt a blush creep up his neck, so he spoke quickly before Tony could reply, \u201cI mean, I know why. It\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019m Spider-Man, but I-\u201c\n\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\nThat stopped Peter short, his gazed fixed back onto Tony\u2019s devastated face.\n\u201cPeter, that\u2019s not true. I didn\u2019t ask you because you are Spider-Man. I\u2019ve asked you because I love you. I love you because you are Peter Parker. You are a certified genius, someone who listens to his music too loud at night, who likes pineapple on pizza, who didn\u2019t want to go crime-fighting because he had homework. You have an obsession with Lego and nerdy shit and you are the kindest person I\u2019ve ever met. I love you because you are Peter Parker and you just so happen\u00a0to also have super-human powers.\u201d\nTears were filling up Peter\u2019s eyes and he didn\u2019t know how to stop them.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say yes, but whether you do or not, powers or not, I will love you as if you are my own kid, no matter what.\u201d\nPeter flung himself at Tony, wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s neck, and Tony hugged back just as fiercely. They both ignored the crunching sound, which was most likely them crushing the half-built Star Wars model. Comparatively, it was hardly of importance.\u00a0\nAs Peter\u2019s tears abated, Tony pulled back.\nHe looked into Peter\u2019s face, \u201cI don\u2019t want to assume anything, but was that a yes?\u201d\nPeter choked out a laugh.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, I would love to be your son.\u201d\nHe smiled tearfully and Tony responded in kind, hugging him again.\u00a0\n\nWho would have thought they would go from Tony saying that \u2018we aren\u2019t there yet\u2019 for hugging to asking him to be his son? This is like a dream come true.\u00a0\n\n****\nAfter actually wiping away the tears and getting changed, Peter and Tony emerged from Peter\u2019s room.\nMay, sat at the kitchen table, all dressed, with a coffee mug in hand. She looked up at they entered the room.\u00a0\nHer expression was nervous as she spotted the tear-tracks down Peter\u2019s face, but the moment she saw his smile, she beamed. \u201cYou said yes?\u201d\nPeter nodded, glancing between Tony and May, as though checking to see if this was all real. \u201cI said yes.\u201d\n\u201cPeter Parker, is officially going to be my son.\u201d\nThe pride in Tony\u2019s voice was unmistakeable. The three of them drew into one big group hug, each unable to hold back their excitement and gleefulness.\u00a0\nOnce they\u2019d settled back down for breakfast, the realities of the situation began to kick in for Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cTon- Can I still call you Tony?\u201d\nTony startled a little at the question, glancing to May for assurance.\n\u201cYou can, if you like, but... if you want to that is, you could call me Dad?\u201d\n\u201cDad? Dad.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter tested the word. It wasn\u2019t a word he remembered ever using before, but from the way Tony\u2019s face lit up when he said it, he knew he would be using it a lot from then on.\n\u201cOkay, then.. Dad?\u201d Tony merely grinned. \u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWill... Will anything change with Aunt May? Will I have to live here full-time?\u201d\nRealising Peter\u2019s concern, Tony wanted to assuage his fears. \u201cNo, not if you don\u2019t want to. We can keep doing what we do now. Whenever your Aunt is free, you can stay with her, otherwise you can stay here. At home.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about my name, I can still keep Parker, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, kiddo, of course. Your parents were called Parker. Your Uncle Ben was called Parker. Aunt May is called Parker. It\u2019s your name, I won\u2019t make you change that. But if you want you can use the name Stark as well. It doesn\u2019t have to be right away, but if you want to, in the future that is, you can.\u201d\nPeter nibbled as his bottom lip, considering.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to now, at least, not until school is over. I don\u2019t think anyone there would understand. Except maybe Ned, and MJ.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s your decision. And as for telling people, we won\u2019t do that until you\u2019re ready. Okay?\u201d\nPeter felt a rush of anxious realisation run through him. \u201cBut-But what about the Avengers?! If you told them, they could tell other people.\u201d\nMay soothingly reached to rub Peter\u2019s back, calming him.\u00a0\n\u201cSweetie, it\u2019s okay. Your Dad-\u201d Peter felt his heart swell,\u201d-had some words with them. He told them-\u201c May coughed embarrassedly, trying to find the words.\n\u201c-Well let\u2019s just say the language isn\u2019t appropriate to say, right now. But essentially, while they might have thought they were acting in Pepper\u2019s best interest, Tony stressed to them that they completely violated Tony\u2019s privacy and were well out of order. They aren\u2019t allowed to come back until they\u2019ve apologised and they cannot tell anyone about you without fear of being sued so hard that they would have to bankrupt several small countries to get out of it. So, Peter, don\u2019t worry about the Avengers. Your Dad has them covered.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about Pepper?\u201d\nTony felt his heart stutter. He hadn\u2019t even considered what Pepper\u2019s reaction might be to him now claiming Peter. Did that make him a bad person? It wasn\u2019t like they couldn\u2019t afford it, nor was it like Peter didn\u2019t already live with them, but Pepper might be upset at the lack of consultation, or involvement. Too late now.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your concern, Peter. But, just so you know, Pepper loves you too.\u201d He knew Pepper loves Peter. But beyond that, Tony didn\u2019t want Peter worrying about adult things; he only wanted Peter concerned with when to tell Ned and what homework he needed to do for Monday.\u00a0\n\u201cI will tell Pepper. And don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be delighted. Now, let\u2019s have our first outing together as father and son. To the Science exhibit!\u201d\nPeter grinned.\n****\n\u201cSo. We really fucked that one up, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\nAll the Rogue sat in their East Wing common room, attempting to wrap their heads around what just happened.\u00a0\nSteve didn\u2019t even have it in him to criticise Clint\u2019s cussing, as it seemed appropriate for the situation.\u00a0\nHe was currently clutching a bag of ice to his face where Tony had punched him. He let him, not trying to avoid the blow. After everything they had just accused Tony of, Steve was surprised there wasn\u2019t more violence.\n\u201cWe need to apologise.\u201d Steve confirmed, glancing over at Bucky.\u00a0\nThe guilt was obvious on the ex-hydra agent\u2019s face; they had been working so hard to gain Tony\u2019s trust back after the fiasco in Siberia and they just went straight back into violating his trust again.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Bucky grunted. \u201cBut how can we make this better? We literally just accused him of cheating on the love of his life. We hacked into May Parker\u2019s phone records and we stalked Tony. And then, to make it worse, we bullied him into revealing his son to us before he was ready.\u201d\u00a0\nClint sat beside them, quietly stewing. He contemplated his own family situation, had been thinking of it ever since their encounter with Tony. How would he have felt if any of his team-mates had found the farm and arrived unannounced, catching him and his family unawares? Even when they were all on the best of terms he wouldn\u2019t have acted favourably, so the fact that there had been only a limited amount of yelling and very little maiming spoke volumes of Tony\u2019s restraint.\nWhat would he have wanted Tony to do if the situation was reversed?\n\u201cHere\u2019s the plan. First, we apologise. To Tony and to May and Peter.\u201d\nClint paused, looking around him to ensure that everyone was paying attention. \u201cWhen I say that, I don\u2019t mean as a group. We need to apologise separately. We all fucked up here and so we should all apologise. It\u2019s more genuine that way.\u201d\nSteve, Sam and Bucky nodded along, making mental notes of his instructions. Natasha\u2019s head was tilted, indicating she was listening intently, probably memorising everything. And Wanda had her eyes closed, so Clint assumed she was following along too.\u00a0\n\u201cSecondly, we should get to know Peter. If we want to make repairs with Tony then we can start by showing him that his family is also our family. And, it should go without saying, no more looking into Tony\u2019s life, or Peter\u2019s. We talk to them at the compound only, if they want us to. So no following anyone. We\u2019ve done enough of that.\u201d\nNatsha stood, \u201cAlright team, let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n****\nIt was Peter\u2019s first day at school since Tony offered to adopt him. It still felt surreal.\u00a0\nThe process had been started as soon as he\u2019d accepted. Tony was pushing through on the legally side as he walked into school. He was changing his legal documents and next of kin, he\u2019d even put Peter in his will. Not that he wanted to think about that potential.\u00a0\nTony - his Dad - said he\u2019d be contacting the school today to change guardianship names and address, especially since his primary residence was now the Compound.\u00a0\nThe teachers and any staff with access to school files would be asked to sign NDAs today. It made Peter\u2019s skin itch with nerves.\u00a0\nPeter looked up in surprise. He\u2019d manage to walk to his locker on auto-pilot, not even paying attention the the hubbub surrounding him; purely relying on his spidey-sense to lead him through the crowd. It spoke a lot of his sense development that he\u2019d been able to do it without thinking.\u00a0\nHe grabbed his books out of his locker and waited. Turns out he didn\u2019t have to wait long, as Ned came around the corner not two minutes later.\n\u201cNed, Ned, Ned.\u201d\u00a0\nHe scrambled over to him and intercepted before Ned could reach his locker. Ignoring the other boys confusion, he dragged Ned into the closest \u2018Boys\u2019 bathroom.\u00a0\n\u201cWoah, Peter what\u2019s up?\u201d\nWithout responding, Peter started checking the bathroom stalls. \u201cMake sure the door stays closed, Ned.\u201d\nNed moved his bags to weigh the door down and leaned against it. \u201cPeter, what\u2019s happening? Is it your internship stuff?\u201d\u00a0\nNed\u2019s voice lowered to a whisper when he said \u2018internship\u2019, which was their not-so-subtle code word for anything spider-related.\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Well, not quite.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter started pacing, shaking his hands out nervously. \u201cSo, there was this thing on Saturday-I mean, it started on Friday- May and I went over to the Compound and we- Well, doesn\u2019t matter-\u201c\n\u201cPeter, just tell me, man. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d\n\u201cTony Stark is adopting me.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! NO WAY!\u201d Ned immediately pounced on Peter, hugging and jumping, elated. \u201cOh MY God, tell me everything!\u201d\nPeter\u2019s chest loosened, he grinned.\u00a0\nMaybe today would be a good day.\n****\nToday had not been a good day.\u00a0\nFlash had caused him to drop all his books that morning, heading into class, and trodden all over his homework to the point where the writing was indecipherable. It had effectively ruined his morning\u2019s good mood and, also, succeeded in getting him a detention in chemistry.\u00a0\nHe was grateful to heading back to the Compound (or should he start officially calling it home?).\nEven just yesterday, he had found himself more relaxed than the past few weeks; now if he saw any of the Rogues he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about hiding, he now had a valid excuse for being in the compound.\u00a0\nOver the weekend the Rogues had individually apologised to him. From what Tony (his Dad) had said, they had done so to him too.\nPeter hadn\u2019t wanted to make things easy for them; his Dad had opened their home to the Rogues and all of them had effectively thrown any trust they\u2019d been given out of the window.\nSo, yeah, he\u2019d been a little bitter about the whole situation.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d made Steve and Bucky\u2019s apologies\u00a0as long and drawn out and awkward as he could. Those men had left his father to die in the wastelands of Siberia, someone who had considered them friends, so no, Peter had not felt forgiving. He\u2019d taken comfort from the fist-shaped bruise on Steve\u2019s face; it looked Tony-sized.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d even gone out of his way to mention the school PSAs of Captain America to Sam, to his strong amusement; he hadn\u2019t felt as angry at Sam, he hadn\u2019t been a team-mate or friend of Tony\u2019s before the Civil War so it wasn\u2019t as much of a betrayal, he\u2019d just been fighting for his friends.\nHe thought back to the days where he\u2019d been excited to catch Captain America\u2019s shield. How things have changed.\u00a0\nSince that fateful Saturday, the Rogues had all gone out of their way to interact with him when they saw him.\u00a0\nSo as he got out of the car and walked into the Compound from school on Monday, he had a number of them waving at him awkwardly.\u00a0\nHe ignored them.\nIt was lucky Peter had the experience interacting with them as Spider-Man, otherwise he\u2019d have felt a lot more overwhelmed than he already did.\nThe only Avenger who was succeeding in breaking past his barriers was the Black Widow. Natasha Romanov.\u00a0\nIt helped that she had been on his father\u2019s side during the so-called Civil War and that she hadn\u2019t left his father to die like he was nothing. It also helped that he was in awe of the way she could kill a man with her pinky finger.\u00a0\nHer apology had been the first and, from what he could tell, the most genuine. After which, she had offered to teach him how to throw knives. That\u2019s right. The Black Widow offered to teach him how to throw knives. Apology accepted.\nThey were going to start immediately after school that afternoon. He\u2019d asked Tony about it, he\u2019d been hesitant at first but agreed to it once Peter said he\u2019d still have time to spend in the lab with Tony.\nArriving in the training room, he double-checked the doors to make sure it was the correct one; Peter found it empty.\nShrugging, he started to stretch.\nHis spidey-sense tingled. It was an underlying buzz, not a cause for alarm, so he didn\u2019t move.\u00a0\nA throwing star flew past his head and imbedded itself in the wall beside him.\u00a0\nPeter pretended to be shocked.\u00a0\nAs in, he swivelled his head around and had an exaggerated look of surprise on his face. Peter didn\u2019t know if he over did it, but he already knew that he wouldn\u2019t be getting any awards in Drama this school year, so he doubted he did well.\n\u201cAwareness-\u201d Natasha dropped down from the rafters in a move that strongly reminded Peter of Hawkeye, making him wonder briefly if they ever had shared training. \u201c-is key to any training, Stark Jnr.\u201d\n\u201cEr, J-Just Peter is fine, Miss Widow.\u201d\nNatasha smiled, \u201cNatasha is fine, Peter.\u201d\nPeter was officially freaking out. This was one of the best days of his life.\nOnce they began throwing the knifes, Peter knew Natsha was surprised at his aptitude. He wondered vaguely if he should be pretending to be worse, but then again that might look even more suspicious.\nBy the end of the session, they had been moving on to moving targets. The moving targets Peter found much harder and would only get their outer body parts, as opposed to the head and heart he\u2019d been getting previously.\nNatasha was a brilliant teacher, patient but critical where needed. He loved every second of it.\u00a0\n\u201cN-Natasha?\u201d\n\u201cYes, \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439?\u201d\n\u201cCould you teach me Russian?\u201d\nNatasha smiled conspiratorially.\n****\n\u201cHey, Peter!\u201d\nAs he walked into Tony\u2019s personal quarters, he was assaulted by a big hug.\n\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d He flailed uselessly for a second, before realising who was hugging him.\u00a0\n\u201cRhodey!\u201d\n\u201cPeter!\u201d\nOnce back on the ground, Peter held his hand out seriously. Rhodey took it just as seriously and began to do their secret handshake, which had taken them an entire day to learn.\n\u201cHey, Petey-Pie, I\u2019m the Dad here! Where\u2019s my hug?!\u201d\nPeter immediately launched himself at Tony. The novelty of the whole situation still rife.\u00a0\nHe stiffened, looking between Rhodey and Tony.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, you told Rhodey about it, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he did! Which means little Peter, that you need to start calling me Uncle Rhodey!\u201d Peter beamed. \u201cYou might be the only niece or nephew I get!\u201d\nTony threw him an unimpressed look. \u201cYour sister is literally 6 months pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cHow, um, how did Pepper take it?\u201d\nTony, who still had his arms wrapped around Peter\u2019s shoulders, moved back to get a good view of Peter\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201cShe said \u2018Welcome to the Family\u2019, Pete.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd so, the tears began again.\u00a0\n****\nA few days later, on Thursday night, Peter crept into his room from Patrol.\u00a0\nIt had been a day or two, with all the madness, since he\u2019d been out and the guilt had been overwhelming.\u00a0\nPeeling off the suit, he winced.\u00a0\nMoving over to the mirror, he caught a glimpse of his injuries. He had what looked to be severely bruised ribs and a black eye, but thankfully no cuts or bleeding.\u00a0\nHe snorted to himself, \u2018All the bleeding is internal, that\u2019s where the blood is supposed to be.\u2019 Damn, Brooklyn-99 is amazing.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Friday.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Junior.\u201d\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t resist rolling his eyes at the new nickname, Tony had been practically vibrating with joy when he\u2019d done it.\u00a0\n\u201cAdd a copy of my injuries to the log, but don\u2019t wake Dad up. Let him see it in the morning, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\nHe\u2019d had a good night all-in-all. He had stopped two muggings, walked a woman home after she\u2019d been harassed and bought a homeless man a hotdog. And then, of course, got caught up in a third robbery gone wrong, with an extra lookout he hadn\u2019t spotted.\u00a0\nThankfully, he\u2019d been able to wrestle one of their knives of them and pin the other to the wall with it, it had been very satisfying.\u00a0\n\nThank you, Natasha.\n\n****\nFriday afternoon, Pepper was coming home.\u00a0\nPeter was nervous. He didn\u2019t know how she had actually taken the news; he had only got Tony\u2019s word for it and he knew Tony would try to protect him from bad news if she hadn\u2019t taken it well.\nHe walked into the Compound with trepidation.\u00a0\n\u201c\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439!\u201d\n\u201c\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441 \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a!\u201d\u00a0\nHe grinned at Natasha.\u00a0\nShe frowned back at him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d\nHe startled. He had forgotten he still had a bruise, to be honest. He\u2019d told Tony about it and everyone at school had bought the excuse that he\u2019d been hit by a baseball in the park, so he\u2019d forgotten that other people might see it and be worried.\u00a0\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nHe tried not to shift guiltily.\u00a0\n\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo-one, it was an accident, I swear!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Natasha\u2019s face crinkled with concern. \u201cAre you getting bullied?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! I mean, yes, but he didn\u2019t do this.\u201d Peter stumbled over his words.\u00a0\n\u201cWho is bullying you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just some dickhead called Flash. But it\u2019s fine, he didn\u2019t do this. He\u2019s just some kid.\u201d\nNatasha pursed her lips angrily, but nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re still on for Sunday?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d\n****\nEntering their quarters, he came face-to-face with a disaster waiting to happen.\u00a0\nThere, in front of him, was May and Pepper laughing loudly and conspiratorially together, with Tony sulking in the corner.\u00a0\nHearing the \u2018ding\u2019\u00a0 of the elevator, Tony rushed over to Peter, whispering, \u201cFinally, I\u2019ve been waiting for some backup.\u201d\n\u201cSweetie!\u201d Aunt May held her arms out for a hug. Obliging, Peter melted into it.\u00a0\nHe turned slowly round to Pepper, only to see her also open her arms invitingly. His face crumpled with relief.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, you are one of the family. You and your Aunt. Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you differently.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d The echoing voice fo Friday rang out, \u201cPizza has arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI guess family dinner is a-go then.\u201d\nPeter glanced around at Aunt May, Pepper and Tony. Yeah, family.\u00a0\n****\nIt was but a couple of hours later, that they got the call.\u00a0\nFriday interrupted, telling them that Thor and Bruce Banner had landed a space ship in rural Wyoming and they and the ship were being escorted to the compound by former SHIELD agents.\nImmediately, Tony had instructed Friday to alert the other Avengers. They may not be getting on right now, but everyone deserved to be there for a reunion. Bruce. It had been two years. Where had they been?\u00a0\nA lot had changed in two years. Tony glanced at Peter. A lot had changed.\u00a0\nThe team had assembled outside the compound, including: Sam, Steve, Bucky, Wanda, Clint, Rhodey, Vision, Pepper, May, Natasha, Peter and Tony.\nNatasha had begun talking to Peter slowly in Russian, with him replying just as slowly back. When had that happened?\nMeanwhile, the others were clustered to the side, guiltily glancing between Pepper and May.\u00a0\nTony may have listened to their apologies, for the sake of the Team and Peter, but he still wasn\u2019t ready to forgive them. He felt a jolt of satisfaction run through him when he saw the yellowing tinge of a healing bruise on Steve\u2019s face. He must have hit Steve really hard for it to still be there nearly a week later. Good.\n\u201cDad?\u201d\u00a0\nHe instinctually turned at the address, before a warm feeling spread through him. Every time Peter called him Dad, he felt like the luckiest man alive.\u00a0\n\u201cShould I be here?\u201d\n\u201cWha-? Of course you should! I want Bruce to meet you.\u201d He wrapped an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders, \u201cAnd you always said you wanted to meet him and discuss anti-electron collisions or his thermonuclear fusion papers, why would you pass on that?\u201d\nHe ruffled Peter\u2019s hair, \u201cCome on, kiddo, settle down. You\u2019re staying with us.\u201d\nFrom next to Peter, Tony heard May teasing him, \u201cYeah, Peter. You know I\u2019ve always wanted to ask Dr Banner about thermonuclear thingys, you wouldn\u2019t let me miss this opportunity, would you?\u201d\nAs Peter sat himself down, Tony caught Clint glancing at him out of the corner of his eye. Clint was smiling sadly at their interaction. It reminded Tony that Clint had only been allowed to see his kids a handful of times since his release. He must miss them.\nHe mightn\u2019t be Clint\u2019s, or any of the Rogues, biggest fan right now, but he wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. He made a mental note to look into extending the timing of supervised leave for the Rogues. \u00a0\nHe was listening to the surrounding conversations, waiting for the roaring of an engine, when he overhead the absent-minded, innocent questioning of Sam. \u201cHey, if all the Avengers are here, where\u2019s Spider-Man?\u201d\nIt was an innocent enough question, but it was one that would have to be dealt with in the near future. The Team were bound to be curious about the newest recruit, but Tony figured with the extreme recent violation of privacy they wouldn\u2019t be hankering after answers any time soon. But it was only a matter of time.\u00a0\nIt was only an hour or so later that they heard the tell-tale signs of a spaceship\u2019s engine. When did that become a semi-normal sound?\nIt settled in the grass in-front of the compound.\nTony felt himself bristle a little, thinking, Thor really does not care about lawn maintenance.\nHe glanced over at Steve only to see him staring straight back at him, clearly remembering the same conversation.\u00a0\nHe looked away.\nWhen the ship opened, Thor, Bruce and a woman in a white body suit trudge out.\u00a0\nImmediately, the Avengers converged.\u00a0\n\u201cBruce!\u201d\n\u201cThor!\u201d\n\u201cPoint Break!\u201d\n\u201cBanner!\u201d\nWith no sense of order, Thor and Bruce started getting passed around, hugs and handshakes galore.\u00a0\n\u201cMidgardians, this is our sister in arms, Brunnhilde. She is a Valkyrie, one of the great warriors of the Valkyrior and my good friend.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Valykyrie. And amazing to see both of you, Thor, Banner. Come inside, we\u2019ve a lot to catch you up on and I\u2019m sure you do too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll come in, but first can we secure some more food and water? We\u2019ve got a lot of people in the space ship.\u201d Nodding, Tony motioned for some of the Agents around him to get to it.\u00a0\n\u201cSure, bud. What\u2019s with the brigade?\u201d\nThor looked down, the loss of his homeland hitting him once more. \u201cMy sister Hela destroyed Asgard. We-We are refugees, asking Earth for sanctum.\u201d\n****\nFinally inside, the Thor told the others of his Father\u2019s death and how Hela had used his passing to try take back Asgard. He said of how he met Valkyrie and re-united with Bruce and then of how Hela had slaughtered countless people and eventually destroyed his home.\u00a0\nThere was a silence when he had finished, everyone trying to come to terms with everything that had happened. \u00a0\nFinally, Tony spoke up. \u201cThor, we are really sorry about what\u2019s happened. And we\u2019re gonna do everything in our power to get you and your people refugee status here, all of us.\u201d\nTony glanced around, to receive a round of nodding. It might have been the first time since the pardoning that all the Avengers (Rogues and otherwise) were in agreement.\n\u201cThank you, Stark. Your generosity knows no bounds.\u201d Thor raised the mug he held up as a toast.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about you, my friends? It has been years, you must have shared your own adventures together? For instance, who are the new members of your team?\u201d Thor pointed to both Peter and May, who had drifted quietly off to the corner of the room.\u00a0\nThe group paused, glancing at each other as though to ask who would break the news of the so-called Civil War to Thor. When none came forward, Tony jumped on the second question, which was slightly less uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\u201cThis-\u201c He stood up and reached around for Peter, dragging him reluctantly to the middle of the group. \u201c-is my son, Peter. And his Aunt. Aunt May.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s jaw dropped. His eyes flickering between Peter and Tony.\u00a0\nInclining his head towards Thor, he whispered. \u201cExactly, how long were we gone for?\u201d\nTony laughed. \u201cYou were only gone two years, don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s just a fast grower, aren\u2019t you Pete? Peter. Bruce. Bruce. Peter.\u201d Motioning between them.\n\u201cDr Banner, it is an honour to meet you. I loved your work on stabilising quantum tunnels, it was fascinating.\u201d Peter stuck his hand out, shaking Bruce\u2019s excitedly, without breathing he turned to Thor. \u201cOh my God, Mr Thor, is that really Mj\u00f6lnir? Does it really have the power to emit it\u2019s own force field? I heard it is capable of controlling vortices and manipulating molecular expansion, is that true? Can it-?\u201d\n\u201cWoah woah, slow down there buddy, give the guy a chance to speak.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter blushed, shuffling embarrassedly.\u00a0\nWhile Bruce leaned over to Tony and whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s got your brains there, Tony.\u201d\nTony couldn\u2019t help but whisper back proudly, \u201cNo, Bruce. He\u2019s got a brain well beyond mine.\u201d\nThor grinned, clearly enjoying Peter\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cYou are welcome to hold it, Son of Stark, if indeed you are worthy.\u201d\u00a0\nEveryone in the group laughed or grinned at the invitation. It was a reminder of better times, before the Civil War and before, even, Ultron. It was almost as though, with the arrival of Thor and Bruce, they were transported back to that evening of joking and drinking, everyone getting on with each other.\u00a0\nPeter gaped at Thor. \u201cCan I?!\u201d\u00a0\nHe then turned to May and Tony, as though for permission.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stopping you, sweetie.\u201d\n\u201cGo for it kid, I\u2019d love to be the father of a King.\u201d\nPeter was practically vibrating with excitement. However, as he looked at the eager faces around him and back at the hammer, he was less and less sure he wanted to find out.\n\u201cWhat you waiting for there, Pete?\u201d\n\u201cI-I- Maybe I shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to.\u201d\nThere was a chorus of \u2018noooo\u2019s\u2019 and \u2018boos\u2019, when Peter noticed Natasha not joining in. Looking at her curiously, she shrugged. She said, in Russian, \u201cIt was not a question I wanted answered either.\u201d\nPeter nodded, but despite the encouragement around him, he declined to pick up the hammer.\u00a0\nFinally as the night wore on, Thor asked the question that they\u2019d been avoiding since the start, \u201cSo. What else has happened since we\u2019ve been gone?\u201d\n****\nPeter had left not long after, not wanting to stay in the now uncomfortable and slightly tense atmosphere as they touched on the subject of their split.\n\u00a0So, instead, Peter had snuck out and gone on patrol.\u00a0\nHours later, in the early hours of the morning, Peter crept back in as stealthily as possible. As he passed through the lounge area, where they had congregated that night, he caught a glimpse of Thor\u2019s Mj\u00f6lnir laying on the table.\u00a0\nHe paused.\u00a0\nIt couldn\u2019t hurt for him to at least get a picture holding the handle, right? That would be fine, right? Come on, Ned would kill him if he had the chance and didn\u2019t take it.\nLooking around and letting his spidey-sense roam, he knew the room was empty.\u00a0\nWith that, Peter removed his mask. He wrestled his StarkPhone out of his pocket and leant it up against the nearby lamp.\u00a0\nSetting the timer to take a photo in 10 seconds, he rushed around to the handle. He placed his hands either side and as the counter beeped down he pulled.\u00a0\nHowever, instead of it staying still on the counter, as expected, the hammer moved.\nMj\u00f6lnir lifted with Peter\u2019s arms. The force that Peter had lifted it with caused him to topple; having not shifted to account for balance.\nHe looked towards his phone as he fell, the look of surprise on his face genuine as he held the Mj\u00f6lnir in the air.\u00a0\nThe flash went off.\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d\nPeter lay on the floor. What on Earth just happened?\nHe lifted his head up off the floor and looked to his right hand which was wrapped around the handle of the hammer. Did I just-?\nPeter looked around once more, no-one was in sight. Should I tell someone? Would letting them know mean that they\u2019d guess at his identity as Spider-Man? What about Tony? Would people look at him differently? Would Tony? Maybe... Maybe it\u2019s something that no-one needs to know.\u00a0\nIt\u2019ll be something just for Peter. But still.\n\u201cOh MY God.\u201d\n****\nIn the dark of his and Pepper\u2019s room, Tony gawped at the StarkPad infront of him. Did Peter just-?\n\nPeter felt different, though he knew theoretically nothing had changed, nonetheless, he felt the difference as though it was a physical siren above him.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t let it change anything; after all, who would believe that he,  Peter Parker,\u00a0could hold Thor\u2019s hammer? That he was \u2018worthy\u2019.\nPeter couldn\u2019t believe it himself, and he had  done  it.\nBut it was fine, no-one else was there, he could keep it hidden and the only evidence he had of it was a photo saved on his StarkPhone and FRIDAY. He\u2019d already begged FRIDAY not to show the clip to anyone, with the AI agreeing as long as Tony did not ask  directly  to see it.\n\nSo here Peter was, in the Tony\u2019s and his family kitchen, trying to act as normal as possible, and distractedly pouring Cocopuffs into his cereal bowl.\n\n\nIf Peter had been a little more observant, he might have noticed the way Tony was staring at him the entirety of breakfast, as though he knew something that Peter didn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201c-ete? Pete?\u201d\n\nPeter jerked, his mind snapping back to the kitchen around him and away from the scenario his mind was putting before him: a situation where he told the Avengers, told  Tony,\u00a0about holding  Mj\u00f6lnir  only for them to ask for a demonstration. Except when it came to showing them that he held it, the hammer didn\u2019t move; the world would realise that it had made a mistake, that there was  no  way that he would have been worthy to hold the hammer.\n\nHe tuned back in to see Tony staring at him.\n\n\n\u201cWha-? Sorry, Dad... I was, er, just thinking about the new Lego set Ned got. You know, just got a bit distracted.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sure, Pete.\u201d Tony nodded quickly, easing Peter\u2019s concern. \u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s something else on your mind... is there anything you want to tell me?\u201d\n\n\nPeter broke his gaze from Tony\u2019s face guiltily, not seeing the hopeful look on his face. \u201cUh, no. Not really. Just normal school stuff and, you know, Spider-Man stuff.\u201d\n\n\nWith his eyes focussed firmly on the cereal bowl in front of him, he failed to noticed the hopeful look fall from his father\u2019s face. \u201cOh, okay kiddo.\u201d\n\n\nWanting a quick escape, Peter wolfed down the rest of his cereal. He leapt from him seat, speaking round the Cocopuffs in him mouth. \u201cY\u2019know I might just head in now, get to school early.\u00a0 Maybe do my homework.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t done your  homework?!\u201d\n\nPeter sped up, laughing as he did.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to me, Pete! Your aunt will kill me!\u201d\n\n\nWhen asked later by Rhodey why he was working to improve the shielding on his iron suit, he blamed Peter.\n\n\n****\n\n\nHaving left as early as he did, he managed to get to school with an hour to spare, and ended up using the time to complete his previously abandoned work.\n\n\nBy the time Ned arrived, he\u2019d even began drawing up design for potential improvements to his Spider-suit. He hoped Tony would approve of them. It had been such a long morning that he\u2019d almost managed to forget his agitation from the morning and what caused it.\n\n\nHowever, Ned managed to remind him the moment he sat down.\n\n\u201cPeter, Peter, Peter. I can\u2019t believe you met a god yesterday. A literal  god.  Was he as good looking in person? Did you see it? You know, his magic hammer?! Did you get to-\u201d\n\n\u201cNed, woah. Slow down, man.\u201d\n\n\nPeter made a placating gesture with his hands. His face flushed lightly from Ned\u2019s words; unable to prevent his teenage mind making them more euphemistic than necessary.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you can\u2019t send me texts and photos of you meeting Thor  and  Dr Banner and not expect me to freak! This is one of the coolest things to ever happen to us!\u201d\nAny rationale Peter had about telling Ned and him being calm and clear headed about the whole  \u2018I held Mj\u00f6lnir\u2019  thing shrivelled up and died in that moment. Nevertheless, Ned was his \u2018Guy in the Chair\u2019, he had to tell him.\n\n\u201cCan I tell you something and you promise not to freak out?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this something related to...  your Dad? \u2018Cos if it\u2019s anything on that level I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d\n\u201c Ned,\u00a0 I\u2019m being serious.\u201d\n\u201cFine,  okay. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI need to show you something, just-just don\u2019t  scream,\u00a0alright?\u201d He reached into his hoodie, pulling out his StarkPhone reluctantly.\n\u201cPffft. I  won\u2019t.\u00a0I\u2019m your \u2018Guy in the Chair\u2019, whatever you\u2019ve got to show me won\u2019t faze m-HOLY SHIT!\u201c\nInstinctually, Peter slapped his hands over Ned\u2019s mouth in an attempt to muffle his reaction. However, they still manage to garner a  lot  of attention. Pulling Peter\u2019s hand away from his face, Ned cringed minutely. \u201cSorry,\u00a0but  oh my god.  You\u2019re  literally  holding Thor\u2019s hammer. Thor\u2019s  magic hammer.\u00a0Don\u2019t you, like, get to rule Asgard now that you are worthy?\u201d\nPeter felt his stomach plummet a little, remembering the news that Thor had told them about his homeland. \u201cI didn\u2019t mention it over text, but... there  is  no Asgard anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d  Ned whispered, his jaw dropping in horror.\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\u201cThor said it was destroyed by his sister, Hela. And now he\u2019s come with all the Asgardians who survived to Earth for refuge. When he said destroyed, I think he meant it... I think even Loki came with him for safety but I\u2019ve not actually seen him around. And Thor, he lost one of his eyes and everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s messed up, man.\u201d\n\n\nNot knowing what else to say in response, Peter could only agree. \u201cYeah, it really is.\u201d\n\n\nThinking his morning over, Peter wondered if maybe he should have led with that news and then finished with the photo of him holding Mj\u00f6lnir, at least then they would have gone into first period feeling a little more upbeat. Instead, he and Ned trudged into Biology with the knowledge of the loss of an entire civilisation weighing on them.\n\n\nShockingly, it did not make for a good studying environment. \n\n****\nBy lunch time, both he and Ned had been jolted slightly out of their macabre attitudes, mainly due to MJ had spending the entire period before throwing sketches of themselves brooding onto their desks. Peter appreciated this was MJ\u2019s version of concern and support, he felt touched.\n\nUnfortunately, it was also lunchtime when Peter saw the news.\n\n\nHe had put his phone on airplane mode as he did every time he had class; he\u2019d found it difficult to focus otherwise, as he often received a slew of spam messages when Tony got bored in meetings, ones that regularly included gifs of unusual animal friendships. Tony knew him too well.\n\n\nSwitching airplane mode off, Peter found at least a dozen notifications from various news apps he was subscribed to. All of which were alerting him to a confrontation between the Avengers and a previously unknown supervillain contingent.\n\nThe article explicitly said  all  the Avengers were there. Knowing the Avengers and the Rogues like he did, the only way  both  groups would be there together was if it was a full scale invasion or if the attack location was full of vulnerable civilians.\n\nHis heart skipped a beat.\n\nShit.  He needed to go. He needed to go  now.\n\n\u201cNed, Ned,\u201d He gesticulated vaguely in his friend\u2019s direction,\u00a0 motioning towards his phone screen as he did. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d\n\n\nNed\u2019s eyes scanned the screen quickly and without pausing to consider, he responded frantically. \u201cGo, Go! I\u2019ll cover for you with Mr Harris!\u201d\n\n\nNed really was the best friend he could ask for.\n\n\nWithout a second look back, Peter leapt up and scrambled out of the backdoor of the cafeteria.\n\nAunt May will understand, he thought, fully aware that May wouldn\u2019t understand him skipping school unless the world  truly  ended and faded into dust before them.\n\n Too late now. \n\n\nHe swung through the dizzying heights of New York, heading downtown to the last reported attack location.\n\n\nIn the distance Peter could make out a crowd of fleeing citizens. After the attack of New York, there were regular evacuation tests in operation with higher congested areas prone to more regular tests. He supposed they should be grateful for those now, when seeing them successfully in effect.\n\n\nFollowing the direction the civilians were coming from, he finally reached the heart of the battle.\n\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t on par with the attack of New York in terms of scale, the group of superhuman villains were certainly nothing to laugh about, especially considering the heavy civilian casualties he could already see around them.\n\n\nInstantly, Peter joined the fray.\n\n\nHe shot webs over the corner of an alleyway, catching debris that would\u2019ve landed on two cowering, scared teenagers.\n\n\n\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere you been, spandex?\u201d\n\n\u201cKid,  what are you doing here?!\u201d\nThe last one came from Tony directly. The man shouted from across the battlefield, unable to pause and look round at his son. \u201cDon\u2019t you have  that thing  you should be at right now?!\u201d\nWith Tony unable to directly scold him for skipping school, Peter couldn\u2019t help but send a cheeky winky to his father, retorting, \u201cNope. I had nothing on, Mr Stark. I was  completely  free today,  all day.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou little-!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOn your left, Mr Stark!\u201d\n\n\nPeter ducked a projectile that whizzed past Tony\u2019s right shoulder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Cap\u2019s line!\u201d Abandoning his ineffectual attempt at parenting Peter for another time, Tony refocused on the fight before them. Peter similarly weaved through the chaos, dispatching the enemy below when he could.\n\nTaking stock, the teenager landed on a nearby roof beside the God of Thunder, marvelling slightly at the lightening pulsating around him. \u201cHi, Mr Thor. Nice to finally meet you! Do you need some help at all?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do not need help, Young Tonysson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you just call me?!\u201d Peter definitely did  not  squeak.\n\u201cTonysson.\u201d The God glanced over, frowning confusedly. \u201cYour father introduced us yesterday.\u201d\nIf his heart wasn\u2019t already racing from the fighting and adrenaline, it would have spiked in horror. Peter knew for a fact that he had been introduced to Thor as \u2018Peter\u2019,  not  Spider-Man, which meant  Thor knew.\n\nAnxiously, Peter glanced around checking that no one else had heard Thor\u2019s loud proclamation. Seeing the other Avengers otherwise occupied, Peter managed to splutter unconvincingly, \u201cN-No, we haven\u2019t met. You-you must be mistaken, Mr Thor. I-I gotta go!\u201d\n\n\nNot waiting for Thor\u2019s reaction, Peter threw himself bodily off the edge of the building and pounded on his next target.\n\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes of intense fighting, the battle died down, with only a couple stragglers groaning on the ground around them.\n\nHe could breathe again.  Everyone was okay.\nNo sooner than he thought that, Peter hear the dull  ping  of a bullet followed by a surprised cry that he knew all too well.\n\nHe turned around in time to see his father hit the floor with a solid clang.\n\n\n\u201cTony!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStark!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDad!\u201d \n\n\nPeter tripped over debris in his haste to reach Tony taking no notice of the shocked silence around him, instead reaching to remove Tony\u2019s body plates.\n\n\n\u201cFriday, is he okay? What should I do? Karen, how do I stop the bleeding?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKid-\u201c, Tony\u2019s voice was weak with pain. His face, visible only between the cracks of the Iron Man armour, started to go lax. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really I\u2019m-\u201c\n\n\nPeter hands shook, he pressed down but the blood oozing from his father\u2019s stomach wasn\u2019t stopping. Memories of the last time he tried to stem the bleeding of someone he loved flashed before his eyes. Tony\u2019s face morphing with his Uncle Ben\u2019s.\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how long had passed but he felt hands on his shoulders, leading him away, and voices flowing over him.\n\nNo.  No.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t do it.  Not again.\nMaybe he was cursed. Everyone he loved seemed to die. First his biological parents. Then Uncle Ben. And  now.\n\n\u201c-reathe with me. In and out. Like this.\u201d\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t see anything in front of him. Blurry images overlapping each other.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, kid. It\u2019s Uncle Rhodey.\u201d He could hear the words but was no closer to comprehending them. \u201cTony\u2019s fine, the Doctors are looking after him now. He\u2019ll be fine. Peter, your Dad\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe last words were no more than a whisper but Peter could finally hear them. Tony,  his Dad, would be okay.\n\n\u201cU-Uncle Rhodey?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey, yeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\nThe world finally came back in to focus and Peter was shocked to discover he was back at the compound, with a blanket wrapped securely around his shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cTony, where is he? Is he okay?\u201d\n\n\nPeter tried to stand but was pushed firmly back down by Rhodey. \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t. Tony\u2019s fine. The bullet\u2019s been removed and they\u2019re just stitching him up now. It didn\u2019t nick anything important.\u201d\n\n\nHe breathed a sigh of relief and instantly felt the rush of adrenaline and shock leave him. He felt drowsy. \u201cUnc\u2019e Rh\u2019dey?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I got you. You go to sleep, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\nAnd darkness took him.\n\n\n****\n\n\nHe opened one eye groggily, only to wince at the lights.\n\n\nHe groaned.\n\n\nHis stomach hurt, almost like... like he\u2019d been shot.\n\nInstantly, Tony sat up. Pain seared down his sides and a headache flared from the bright lights, but he ignored it.\n\n\u201cTony!\u201d\n\n\u201cRhodey! Is everyone okay?!\u201d He glanced around, looking for the one person he needed to see. \u201cPeter, is he okay? Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cPeter\u2019s fine, Tony, relax. You were the one that was shot.\u201d\nHe leaned back into the medical bay pillows, making a mental note to get better pillows brought in for next time he ended up here. \u201cShot?\u201d The pain in his stomach throbbed. \u201cYeah, that sounds about right.\u201d\n\u201cPeter\u2019s in his room, asleep. He panicked when you were shot, started freaking out. I think he had a flashback of some sort-\u201c, Tony didn\u2019t have to think why; he remembered reading about Ben\u2019s death when he first found Peter, it had said that his teenage nephew had been there when he was shot and seen it all happen.  I\u2019m sorry, kid.\n\n\u201cHe, uh, he called you Dad. Y\u2019know, in front of all the Rogues.\u201d\n\n\n Fuck. \n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Rhodey\u2019s face was as apprehensive as his own, \u201cThey have some questions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s none of their damn business. Tell them that.\u201d\n\n \u201cI already did.  \u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice heavily implied his opinion on the Rogues. \u201cBut they still want answers.\u201d\nTony sighed.  Of course they did.  He wished, just this once, that they would let it go.\u00a0\u201cFine. Send them in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. As you said, it\u2019s none of their business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t have them just walking round without talking to them. What if one of them says something to someone about Peter... or  worse,\u00a0tries to  ask Peter  about it.  No. He\u2019s my son, I\u2019ll answer their questions so he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nRhodey nodded, reluctantly, but went to fetch the Rogues anyway.\n\n\nTony grimaced in pain. Why did this conversation have to happen when he still had a fresh bullet wound?\n\n\nThe Rouges and other Avengers filtered in, one by one, the silence heavy around them until Natsha saw fit to break it.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead, Stark.\u201d\n\n\nTony huffed a laugh. \u201cThanks, Romanov. I appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\nThere was another awkward beat of silence, in which time Tony grudgingly looked at Steve. He felt anger curl within him at the disapproving stare. He blamed the painkillers for what he said next. \u201cFuck you, Rogers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWha-?\u201d\n\n\nSteve looked startled at his verminous outburst.\n\n\u201cI said,  fuck you, Rogers.\u201d\u00a0He elongated the words, as though talking to a child. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look, like your all \u2018holier-than-thou\u2019. You recruited a recovering soldier with PTSD-\u201c, he pointed vaguely in Sam\u2019s direction, \u201c-and a  literal  war criminal.\u201d He made another motion towards Bucky.\n\u201cYou recruited a child, Tony. A   child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know anything about the situation and haven\u2019t even asked me about it and yet you\u2019re already criticising me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was two years ago, Tony, he would\u2019ve been fourte-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen why did you bring him? Were you really that desperate that you\u2019d risk the life of a-?!\u201d\n\n \u201cStop it! \u201d The shouting match was interrupted by Natasha, she stood in the corner of the room, her voice barely raised but cutting through the argument like a knife. \u201cDidn\u2019t we learn anything from last week, about making assumptions about things?!\u201d\nShe glared at Steve, her eyes scanning the others - Sam, Bucky, Clint and Wanda - as she did. \u201cTony\u2019s not the bad guy he\u2019s always painted out to be.\u201d Tony felt tears prickle in his eyes, more grateful than ever to have someone other than Rhodey on his side. \u201cHe\u2019s not like  Hydra  or the people from the Red Room. He\u2019s not churning out  child soldiers. If he was,  trust me,\u00a0I\u2019d have something to say about it. So why don\u2019t we try not assuming anything and just listen to what he has to say?!\u201d\n\nNatasha turned to him expectantly, ignoring the stunned expressions of her peers.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Natasha.\u201d\n\n\nThe assassin just nodded back at him before perching herself on the edge of his bed.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Tony started speaking, his voice bitter. \u201cLook, I know he\u2019s a child, okay. I mean, for God\u2019s sake, he\u2019s  my  child.\u201d He unconsciously found himself seeking out Clint, the only other parent in the room, silently begging him to understand. He didn\u2019t need the Rogues\u2019 forgivenesses, it wasn\u2019t their place to forgive him for anything and yet he couldn\u2019t help but want them to understand.\n\n\u201cPeter, he was already out there fighting. If I didn\u2019t help him, give him the suit for protection and teach him how to do it safely, he would have gone out there anyway. Except he would have gone there without me or even Karen to keep an eye on him. And that, that would have been on my conscience.\u201d\n\n\nClint, on the other side of the room, dipped his head in acknowledgement. It wasn\u2019t much, but Tony appreciated the gesture.\n\n\nBeside him, Steve\u2019s face remained unmoving. \u201cYou brought him to a war zone, Tony.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fully aware of that, Rogers. I  know  it was dangerous. I never said I was the perfect father. I know we mightn\u2019t have been friends towards the end there, but I also didn\u2019t honestly expect anyone to try and actually kill each other.\u201c\n\nThe Captain\u2019s eyes locked onto his and he saw regret and understanding pass through them. A moment passed. A moment where he knew they both remembered how he drove his fist into Tony\u2019s face.\u00a0How his\u00a0shield pushed ruthlessly into Tony\u2019s Arc Reactor. They both remembered Steve leaving him for dead in the wastelands of Siberia.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean-\u201c\n\n\u201cSo you keep saying.\u201d Tony bit out. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t agree with my choices, maybe I don\u2019t agree with them anymore either. I know I\u2019ve made mistakes, been stupid. But Peter is  my  kid, May and I are his parents and we know what\u2019s best for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t regret anything, why\u2019d you keep Peter\u2019s identity a secret?\u201d\n\nHe laughed derisively. \u201cAfter how you\u2019ve all behaved this last week, you\u2019re  really  asking me that?\u201d\nHe turned away from them, wearily pressing his face into the pillows. They were suddenly a lot more comfortable than he remembered them being.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like you all to leave.\u201d\nNot needing Tony to ask again, Rhodey immediately started to push them towards the door. Natasha was the first to leave the room, clearly trying to honour his request for rest and set the example. Bucky and Sam followed suit, trailing after Steve.\n\nClint hesitated on his way towards the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with them asking you questions, you know. I know how hard it is to raise kids, especially with everyone second guessing your choices. I just wanted you to know that.\u201d\n\nThe archer turned without waiting for a response. Just before he reached the door, Tony called out to him. \u201cThanks, Clint. By the way, I made some calls last week. I couldn\u2019t get you extended supervised leave but I made an agreement with Laura. She said the kids could come here for a full weekend every once in a while, instead of just for a few hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha-? You\u2019re serious.\u201d A look of shock mixed with extreme gratitude passed over Clint\u2019s face. \u201cEven after all this?\u201d\n\n\nTony stared back at him seriously seriously, Peter\u2019s face swimming in the back of his mind. \u201cYeah,\u201d He said softly. \u201cEven after all this.\u201d\n\n\n****\n\nIn the couple of days since the altercation in downtown New York, Peter had seen very little of the Rogues around, only spotting them briefly on his way to and from the shower. The awkward glances at him were enough to confirm that they  definitely  had heard him call Tony  \u2018Dad\u2019  while still in his Spider-Man outfit.\n\nWhen he brought it up with his Dad, Tony had just told him that he\u2019d already spoken to them and none of them would cause trouble or bother him about it.\n\n\nOut of all of them only Natasha was acting normal, further lending itself to his belief that she\u2019d already figured it out and just not bothered to tell anyone. Natasha had neither confirmed nor denied it when he\u2019d asked which only made him admire her more.\n\n\nPeter had managed to convince May to let him stay home from school for the rest of the week - though he\u2019d had plenty of grovelling to do for skipping school in the first place - and he had spent most of that time at Tony\u2019s bedside.\n\n\nThe teenager had only left to get a shower and use the rest room; such was his dedication, Tony had even had his staff install a second bed in the room for Peter to sleep in.\n\n\nTony would have found the incessant hovering irritating in anyone else, but with Peter he found it adorable. Thankfully though, for everyone\u2019s sake, Tony was permitted to leave the Medical Bay today which meant Peter\u2019s babysitting could come to an end.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this occasion seemed to have encouraged the Avengers to gather in the shared living quarters of the compound to welcome him back.\n\n\nTony privately wished they would have left the welcoming to just Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, May and Peter.\n\n\n\u201cPete, it\u2019s fine, I can walk to the couch by myself!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know - I just don\u2019t want you straining yourself.\u201d Peter rounded the corner, purposefully ignoring the crowd around them. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll clear the couch for you to sit on.\u201d\n\n\nAbsentmindedly, Peter rushed over to the couch not paying attention to the items he found there and picked it all up.\n\n\nHe heard several gasps, but paying them no heed, he placed the miscellaneous items on the table before him and turned intent on helping his father the rest of the way.\n\n\nHe was brought to a halt by the gobsmacked looks on the entire rooms faces.\n\n\n\u201cDid he just-?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeter, that was-!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked confusedly towards his father, uncertain what the cause of the outbursts were. Tony, in comparison to the other expressions surrounding him, only looked smug.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are they upset about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look behind you.\u201d\n\nPeter rotated on the spot, slowly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t-\u201c He stopped, finally spotting the offending item resting innocuously on the table where he put it.\n\n\n Mj\u00f6lnir. \n\nOh. He glanced back at the Avengers freaking out around him.  Oh.\n\n\u201cWill you believe me if I say it\u2019s not what it looks like?\u201d\n\n\nTony grinned.\n\n\nHe hobbled over to Peter and wrapped his arm round his shoulders. \u201cI told you all, I\u2019m the father of a King.\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked over at Tony in response and beamed. \n"
