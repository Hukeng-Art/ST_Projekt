    "text": "It doesn\u2019t really matter which one of them steps into the array first. \n(It\u2019s Jin Ling. But when Lan Sizhui remembers that later, he\u2019ll keep it to himself.)\nBut truly, it\u2019s beyond the point. Lan Jingyi is close behind him, and Ouyang Zizhen right on his heels. Sizhui is the first to see it. But in his hurry to move forward and herd all three of them out, his own foot lands on the inside edge.\nThis is when three things happen in quick succession. The ground glows bright and hot. Wei Wuxian calls his name. And two hands take Sizhui by the shoulders and pitch him sideways, almost off his feet.\nThe clearing flashes once, like lightning, and dissolves into white. \n***\nSizhui\u2019s ears stop ringing first. \n\u201cJingyi-xiong?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen gasps, somewhere to Sizhui\u2019s left. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\nA squawk of pain Sizhui would know anywhere \u2013 Jingyi\u2019s. \u201cZizhen-xiong, those were my ribs\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s on me?\u201d Jin Ling, completely fine judging by the volume of his voice. \u201cGet off me!\u201d\nSizhui feels his way around himself. He\u2019s still on the ground. He should have guessed that. But between the light and the impact, bright spots are still obscuring his vision. The panic that follows sweeps away everything else.\n\u201cSenior Wei?\u201d he calls. And when no reply comes, it\u2019s like falling all over again. \u201cDid you see what happened to Senior Wei?\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei? He was\u2014\u201d Jingyi cuts himself off, his voice sharp with fear. \u201cSenior Wei! Can you hear us?\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Jin Ling barks. \u201cAnswer us!\u201d\n\u201cSizhui-xiong,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cIn the array\u2026\u201d\nSizhui scrambles to his feet, legs quivering under him. The afterimage of the spell has started to fade from his vision, and the clearing swims into view. No Wei Wuxian that he can see. Just a figure huddled in the array. \nStomach roiling, Sizhui lurches forward. \u201cSenior Wei, are you\u2014\u201d\nThe figure flinches back.\nSizhui slows. And it\u2019s then that he really looks. The person on the ground isn\u2019t Wei Wuxian\u2019s height, weight, build, or even age. He\u2019s looking at a child, maybe four or five. His gray eyes are wide, trained on Sizhui. His dark hair is loose and tangled around his hunched shoulders. He\u2019s swaddled in robes several magnitudes too large for him, and there\u2019s a discarded red ribbon curled at his side. \nSizhui allows himself about ten seconds of disbelief. But he knows perfectly well who he\u2019s looking at.\n\u201cSenior\u2014\u201d Sizhui stops short. The boy blinks, hesitant but curious, and Sizhui pitches his voice lower. \u201cWei Ying?\u201d\nThe child makes a tiny, questioning sound, tilting his head to one side. Then he whispers, \u201cYes?\u201d\nFrom the other side of the clearing, Jingyi raises his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d \n***\nThe first reports of the mountain demon surfaced about a week ago, a little down the river from Cloud Recesses.\nMountain demons are nothing unusual. And with only one leg, they\u2019re not very hard to outrun. But this mountain demon, as Wei Wuxian put it, didn\u2019t play fair. According to locals, the demon set cursed arrays through the woods, barely visible. Traps to leave its victims defenseless.\nThat was what they were looking for this morning. A mountain demon\u2019s hunting hours are much later, well into the night. But Wei Wuxian had hoped to find and disable the arrays first, and if possible, figure out how they worked. There were no survivors to tell, after all. The only traces of the victims were their bones.\nSizhui had a few running theories. None of them, in the end, were even close.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jingyi says, as Sizhui puzzles this out aloud. \u201cOkay! So the demon has been turning its victims into children.\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cTo make them easier prey,\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cSo\u2014\u201d Jingyi\u2019s voice cracks here, \u201cthis kid is Senior Wei.\u201d\nWei Wuxian, still tangled in his own massive robes, blinks politely at them. \n\u201cIf I may repeat myself,\u201d Jingyi says, \u201cwhat the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cJingyi,\u201d Sizhui says, \u201cnot in front of Senior Wei.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Senior Wei!\u201d Jingyi hisses back. \u201cHe already knows that word!\u201d\n\u201cJingyi-xiong,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says, \u201ccalm down.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jingyi says, \u201cis my justifiable terror bothering you?\u201d\nOuyang Zizhen shoots him an uncharacteristic glare. \u201cKids are really sensitive to raised voices. How would you feel if you were that little, surrounded by yelling strangers?\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know he doesn\u2019t recognize us?\u201d Jin Ling\u2019s hands rise to his hips as he turns back to Wei Wuxian. \u201cHey, do you know who we are?\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t flinch, exactly, but he coils into himself. His expression is still neutral, if a little cautious, but Ouyang Zizhen is right. They\u2019re scaring him.\n\u201cCould you all move back?\u201d Sizhui murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll try talking to him.\u201d\nSizhui folds to his knees until he\u2019s nearly eye level with Wei Wuxian, who has migrated into a little ball in the center of the array. Sizhui\u2019s stomach does a neat little twist. Wei Wuxian so rarely looks small.\nBut there\u2019s also something soft and questioning in the crease of his brow, in the way he\u2019s making eye contact with Sizhui even now. Almost like he looks at Sizhui as an adult, when he\u2019s waiting for him to wrap his mind around a half-formed thought. He\u2019s not so scared that he\u2019s closed off. He\u2019s watching to see what Sizhui does.\n\u201cWei\u2014\u201d Sizhui pauses. Allows himself a second to recognize how absolutely bizarre this is. And then softly calls, \u201cA-Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian tilts his head, just a little, to the side. And then slowly, he uncurls. \u201cGege knows me?\u201d\n\u201cOh gods,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cOh no, he called you gege. Oh no.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at him, Jingyi-xiong,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not laughing,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute I wanna die.\u201d\nSizhui tunes them out, biting at this lip. If his math is right\u2014well\u2014Wei Wuxian was orphaned around this age. He needs to gain his trust somehow. But to tell him that they know his parents seems cruel. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember this, but we came here with you, A-Ying. We\u2019re very good friends of yours.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2014A-Ying\u2014is still frowning. But he doesn\u2019t seem overtly suspicious of that. \u201cI don\u2019t remember?\u201d\nSizhui falters. But Ouyang Zizhen jumps right in. \u201cYou\u2019re under a curse, A-Ying,\u201d he says. Which is good thinking. And technically true. \u201cYou must be pretty confused, huh?\u201d\nA-Ying relaxes even further at that. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says softly. Jingyi makes a tortured little sound in his throat. \n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re tired, too.\u201d Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s tone is low, soothing. \u201cIt must be hard to walk in those big robes. Why don\u2019t you let that gege in white carry you? He\u2019s very strong.\u201d\nA-Ying locks eyes with Sizhui again. And a completely unwanted thought surfaces in Sizhui\u2019s mind: that this is the second time in his life he\u2019s looked at Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes in another body.\nWhether Jingyi catches his hesitation, or whether he just wants to pick up A-Ying, it\u2019s hard to say. He moves forward regardless. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he says. \u201cC\u2019mere, A-Ying, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\u201cJust don\u2019t drop him,\u201d Jin Ling says.\n\u201cExcuse you,\u201d Jingyi says, \u201chow many novices have you taken night-hunting lately? They\u2019re like small dogs. They never want to walk by the end.\u201d \n\u201cDog?\u201d A-Ying, who\u2019d been making his careful way to Jingyi in his massive robes, stops short. His face, already pale, loses the rest of its color. \u201cThere\u2019s a dog?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\nSensing Jingyi floundering, Sizhui shakes himself out of his own daze. He flashes a reassuring smile to Jingyi, who mouths an anguished What have I done?, and lays a careful hand on A-Ying\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThere are no dogs here, A-Ying.\u201d \n\u201cNone?\u201d A-Ying looks up at Sizhui dubiously. His robes, a dark blue set commissioned by Hanguang-jun, are pooling well past his feet. If Jingyi tries to carry him like this, they\u2019re both going to trip.\n\u201cNone,\u201d Sizhui repeats. \u201cA-Ying, is it okay if I tie up the end of those robes for you? Then you can go play with my friend Jingyi.\u201d\nWith a thoughtful hum, A-Ying glances down at his legs, as if weighing his options. Sizhui\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever seen a child so careful, even among the ever-obedient Lan novices. Seeing Wei Wuxian so tentative\u2014it doesn\u2019t sit right in his stomach. \nThen A-Ying smiles, a sunny grin that hardly fits his little round face. \u201cOkay!\u201d\nSomewhere behind Sizhui, Jingyi makes a high keening sound.\nSizhui leads A-Ying over to the shade of a nearby tree, which gives the other three a chance to inspect the array, and sets A-Ying down facing away from them. He\u2019s not sure if A-Ying is anxious watching them inspect it, like Sizhui himself probably would have been at that age. But maybe Wei Wuxian would have been curious even back then.\nThere\u2019s only so much that can be done with the robes. For all that Wei Wuxian is shorter in Mo Xuanyu\u2019s body than in his own, he\u2019s still relatively tall, and Sizhui suspects that A-Ying is small for his age. In the end, Sizhui ties the end of the robe in a careful knot and tucks the rest around A-Ying like a nest. There\u2019s a tailor in Caiyi who makes the novices\u2019 robes. He\u2019s bound to have spares at the shop.\nThey do need to go to Caiyi, figure out what they\u2019re going to do next. It\u2019s not safe for A-Ying here, even with the four of them. But the thought of leaving the woods without Wei Wuxian\u2014without the Wei Wuxian they know, at least\u2014is more than Sizhui wants to think about.\nBut Hanguang-jun isn\u2019t here. Wei Wuxian, for all intents and purposes, isn\u2019t here either. Sizhui is the head disciple of Gusu Lan. And that means he has to think about it.\nBy the time Sizhui blinks himself back to the present, A-Ying is staring, his head tipped quizzically to one side. Even through the knot in his chest, Sizhui can\u2019t help but laugh. A-Ying\u2019s hair is falling into his face.\n\u201cWell, we have to do something about that,\u201d he says. \u201cHold still a minute longer, A-Ying.\u201d\nSizhui scoops the red ribbon up from where it had fallen, neatly side-stepping Jingyi and Jin Ling\u2019s whispered argument \u2013 one crisis at a time, Sizhui reminds himself. A-Ying sits obediently as Sizhui gathers it into a knot, secure enough that it\u2019ll hold and loose enough that it won\u2019t tug at his scalp.\nHe ties off the ribbon, pulling back to survey his handiwork. \u201cIs that comfortable, A-Ying?\u201d\n\u201cMm!\u201d A-Ying\u2019s brow crinkles as he reaches up, gently patting down his new hairstyle. His fingers are careful, almost, like he just wants to map out the shape.\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cIt\u2019s how my gege used to tie up my hair when I was little.\u201d\nThe attentive little sound A-Ying makes is so polite beyond his years, Sizhui laughs. He\u2019s traveled with Wei Wuxian enough times to know how quickly people open up to him. Maybe that was true even when he was this young.\nHe swallows. A-Ying\u2019s expression shifts, goes inquisitive. That look hasn\u2019t changed, either.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could tell me what to do,\u201d Sizhui says softly.\nA-Ying frowns again, and kicking himself, Sizhui quickly schools his own expression back into a smile. Whatever the reason, A-Ying is watching Sizhui\u2019s mood intently. Which means Sizhui needs to hold it together. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to see our friends, okay?\u201d And carefully, he hoists A-Ying up into his arms.\nBy the time he crosses the clearing, Jingyi and Jin Ling are still arguing, but no longer anywhere in the vicinity of whispering. Jin Ling crosses his arms with entirely more force than necessary. The jade lotus root pendant at his hip swings, jangling as it knocks his Yunmeng Jiang bell. A-Ying perks up in Sizhui\u2019s arms.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d Jin Ling cuts himself off as Sizhui approaches, but his gaze lands on A-Ying, traces his stare to the pendant. He falters, his lips tight, and then detaches it to lay in A-Ying\u2019s hands. \u201cHanguang-jun will know how to fix this. I say we tell him.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re terrified of Hanguang-jun.\u201d\n\u201cWho says I am?\u201d Jin Ling draws himself higher. \u201cI\u2019m a sect leader now. We\u2019re practically equals.\u201d\nSizhui shifts A-Ying in his hold, watches him trace the patterns of Jin Ling\u2019s pendant with a very un-Wei Wuxian-like hesitance. Jin Ling is absolutely terrified of Hanguang-jun. Sizhui keeps that to himself.\n\u201cEven if we did get his stupid husband cursed,\u201d Jin Ling continues, \u201cit\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna hurt us or anything.\u201d\n\u201cYoung Mistress,\u201d Jingyi says gravely. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the worst that could happen.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the worst?\u201d Jin Ling says.\nJingyi\u2019s face darkens. Ouyang Zizhen, over his shoulder, looks queasy. \u201cHe might stop trusting us with Senior Wei.\u201d\nJin Ling throws his hands in the air. \u201cHe\u2019s the teacher!\u201d he screeches. \u201cThey should need to trust him with us!\u201d\n\u201cJin Ling,\u201d Sizhui says warningly when he feels A-Ying twitch. \u201cVolume.\u201d\nJin Ling rounds on him, flushed red down to his neck, his mouth already open. But he shuts his eyes and, as if it pains him, takes a loud, slow breath in. \n\u201cOkay, Lan Sizhui,\u201d he grits out. \u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d\nSizhui falters. A-Ying shifts in his arms, still inspecting the pendant. Jin Ling once said it was his mother\u2019s. Maybe even now, Wei Wuxian recognizes it.\n\u201cPlease, Sizhui,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cI swear if we can\u2019t figure it out, we\u2019ll go to Hanguang-jun. But let\u2019s try to solve it on our own first? I can\u2019t look him in the eye and tell him I got Senior Wei cursed.\u201d\nSizhui closes his eyes, shutting out the expectant faces clustered around him. Mistakes happen. Hanguang-jun has been telling Sizhui that since he can remember. Hanguang-jun would understand. He would.\nBut Jingyi didn\u2019t get Wei Wuxian cursed. Or Jin Ling, or Ouyang Zizhen. Wei Wuxian was in that array to pull Sizhui out.\n\u201cJust for a few hours,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cThen we go to Hanguang-jun.\u201d\nJingyi brightens. \u201cA few hours,\u201d he agrees. \u201cNow bring him over here, it\u2019s my turn. A-Ying, you want to spend some time with your Jingyi-gege, right?\u201d\nSizhui hesitates. But A-Ying doesn\u2019t seem worried at the prospect of being held by someone different. He looks up once, as if to check Sizhui\u2019s reaction, and then smiles. \u201cOkay!\u201d\n\u201cWhy does Lan Jingyi get to hold him next?\u201d Jin Ling says. \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle.\u201d\n\u201cYou have never once called him \u2018uncle\u2019 to his face,\u201d Jingyi says placidly, transferring A-Ying\u2019s weight from Sizhui\u2019s arms to his own.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jin Ling huffs. \u201cHe\u2019d be insufferable.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do we do, Sizhui-xiong?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cWe checked the array, but it\u2019s not one any of us have studied.\u201d \nSizhui sinks. He was worried about as much. \u201cWe should get off the mountain first,\u201d he says. \u201cJingyi and I will send a message ahead to Cloud Recesses, to some of our shidi with night-hunting experience. We can research the array while they track the demon.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wait at all?\u201d Jin Ling says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quicker if we track it ourselves. Most curses can be undone by killing the caster.\u201d\n\u201cYoung Mistress Sect Leader,\u201d Jingyi says, with the kind of faux patience he must know Jin Ling hates, \u201cwe\u2019re not bringing a baby to fight a demon.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a baby,\u201d Jin Ling snaps.\n\u201cI\u2019m six,\u201d A-Ying says helpfully.\n\u201cMy mistake. He\u2019s six.\u201d Jingyi bounces A-Ying higher on his hip. \u201cClearly he\u2019s ready for his first night-hunt.\u201d\n\u201cMountain demons are most active during hai hour,\u201d Sizhui says with a glance at the late morning sun. \u201cWe have time. For now, we should go to Caiyi and get A-Ying some clothes.\u201d\nA little growl punctuates Sizhui\u2019s thought, and Jingyi shifts his grip on A-Ying to grin down at him. \u201cAnd maybe some food, too. Because someone\u2019s little belly is talking.\u201d\nJin Ling\u2019s brow crinkles. \u201cYou do remember that\u2019s Wei Wuxian, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nJingyi blithely ignores him. \u201cHow about it, A-Ying? Are you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cFood?\u201d A-Ying straightens in Jingyi\u2019s arms. But his next words are deliberate, almost careful. \u201cI can have some?\u201d\nSizhui can tell by the way the group shifts that he\u2019s not the only one who caught that phrasing.\nOuyang Zizhen recovers first, striding over to poke A-Ying\u2019s cheek until he\u2019s smiling again. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018some?\u2019\u201d he says, his tone light. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get everything you want, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d A-Ying says. And that\u2019s another look Sizhui recognizes from Wei Wuxian. The one where he doesn\u2019t quite believe you. \u201cOkay!\u201d\nJingyi lets out a long breath. \u201cYou\u2019re really good with kids, Zizhen-xiong.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest of three,\u201d he says. But his smile sobers a little as he looks around the group. He must have realized, even before Sizhui did, that the rest of them are only children.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Sizhui says gently. \u201cA-Ying\u2019s going to get cold.\u201d\n\u201cZizhen-xiong,\u201d Jingyi says, \u201cwanna take him for a bit?\u201d\n\u201cCan I?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen lights up.\nJingyi laughs, depositing him carefully into Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s arms. \u201cYeah, he likes you. Don\u2019t you, A-Ying?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d A-Ying chirps. Ouyang Zizhen makes a sound like a tea kettle\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Jin Ling grumbles, \u201che\u2019s my uncle.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jin Ling,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says, \u201cyou can hold him when we get to Caiyi.\u201d\nJingyi lets Jin Ling and Ouyang Zizhen go a little ahead, and falls into step with Sizhui. Pebbles tumble under their shoes as they make their way to where the ground slopes, back in the direction of Caiyi. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, leaning in. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nSizhui uncoils a fraction. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been too obvious. But this is Jingyi. Jingyi can always tell.\n\u201cI was careless,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t anything,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t pushed us out of the array, it\u2019d be you, Senior Wei, and three toddlers. And that\u2019d be a whole different brand of fun for you. I think you remember what six-year-old me was like.\u201d\nSizhui knows his smile must look tired. But he can\u2019t quite stop it, either. \u201cAt least then we\u2019d have Senior Wei.\u201d\n\u201cWe still have him, Sizhui.\u201d Jingyi bumps his shoulder. \u201cAnd by this time tomorrow, he\u2019ll be back to his usual self. I promise you.\u201d\nSizhui glances up to A-Ying, who\u2019s peering backwards at them over Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019s okay?\u201d\n\u201cA-Ying? Yeah, he seems like it,\u201d Jingyi says with a shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s so well-behaved, right? And quiet. I didn\u2019t expect that from a little Senior Wei.\u201d\nSizhui hums noncommittally and lets them lapse into silence. Every now and then lately, when he feels comfortable or he\u2019s not paying attention to the words coming out of his mouth, Wei Wuxian drops a scrap of information about himself, and Sizhui quietly, unobtrusively collects it. Sizhui has a patchwork story of Wei Wuxian in his mind now, threaded together by guesses. And if they\u2019re true, then that\u2019s not his information to share.\nThat\u2019s all they are, though: guesses. Wei Wuxian, like Hanguang-jun, tucks his own problems far out of Sizhui\u2019s reach, like he\u2019s three years old again and they don\u2019t want him eating something toxic. That doesn\u2019t stop Sizhui from looking, though. He knows Hanguang-jun holds his sadness at the core of himself. And he knows Wei Wuxian darts and sidesteps around it like a field of glass, all the while pretending it doesn\u2019t exist.\nBut he tucks his unease to the back of his mind, and he keeps walking. There\u2019s a time to get in your own head \u2013 and believe me, I love those times, Wei Wuxian would say, were he here. But most of the time, you need to put all that aside. And you just need to get to work.\nSo Sizhui gets to work.\n***\nSizhui has never been so grateful for the sterling, untouchable reputation of the Lan. If the tailor has any questions about why they\u2019re bringing their so-called \u2018new disciple\u2019 to the shop on such short notice, swaddled in a set of robes several magnitudes too big for him, he doesn\u2019t ask.\n\u201cYes, I believe I have sample robes in an adequate size,\u201d is all he says. \u201cJust a moment, Lan-gongzi.\u201d\nSo they hand off A-Ying to be fitted. And then they sink, as a group, onto the bench at the front of the shop.\n\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cMy head hurts. How do I know if I\u2019m having a qi deviation?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019d probably know,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says gently.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet that\u2019s what Nie Mingjue thought,\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cJingyi,\u201d Sizhui says. But he lacks the energy to chide any further than that.\n\u201cYeah, not funny,\u201d Jingyi readily admits, leaning back against the wall. Sizhui keeps up his Proper Lan Posture, but barely. \u201cAt least he\u2019s obedient. Senior Wei\u2019s hard enough to keep track of when he\u2019s full size.\u201d\n\u201cAt least we didn\u2019t have to convince him to come with us,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen agrees.\nJingyi relaxes back, closes his eyes. But a minute later, he\u2019s sitting straight up again. \u201cGods,\u201d he says. \u201cHe just came with us.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 yeah, we just said that,\u201d Jin Ling says.\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d Jingyi makes a series of vague, distressed gestures. \u201cWe just told him that we were his friends that he didn\u2019t remember, and he believed us? Senior Wei!\u201d\nSizhui swallows. Next to him, Jin Ling mutters a prayer of thanks to his maternal grandfather. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t let him out of our sight,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cSomeone watches him at all times,\u201d Jingyi agrees fervently. \u201cBefore someone else tries to adopt him.\u201d\nAnother minute of weary silence passes before Jin Ling speaks up. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll remember this once he\u2019s changed back?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know? Probably,\u201d Jingyi says. And when he turns to look at Jin Ling\u2019s face, he adds, suspiciously, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d Jin Ling fidgets. \u201cFairy\u2019s really good with kids. If he had some better experiences\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYoung Mistress,\u201d Jingyi says calmly, \u201cif I see a dog within ten li of that baby, I am sending it to Qinghe.\u201d\nJin Ling bristles. \u201cIt was just an idea.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me for interrupting.\u201d From the back of the shop, Sizhui hears a sweep of fabric before the tailor rounds the corner, leading A-Ying by the hand. \u201cWe\u2019re all finished here. Would you like me to bill Gusu Lan directly, per usual?\u201d\n\u201cYe\u2014\u201d Sizhui\u2019s mouth snaps shut. Hanguang-jun reviews the Gusu Lan ledger at the end of every month. If he sees a payment for robes for a disciple that doesn\u2019t exist\u2026\nWhether Jin Ling picks up on this, or whether he just wants to end the silence the first way he knows how, he\u2019s the first one to speak up. \u201cPlease bill Lanling Jin. In full.\u201d\nThe tailor\u2019s eyebrows rise so high, they threaten to become one with his hairline. \u201cThen this humble one will do so,\u201d he says. \nAs the tailor returns to the back, Sizhui finally turns his attention back to A-Ying, who looks much more relaxed to have clothes that fit him properly. It is, of course, another level of bizarre to see Wei Wuxian in a uniform that Sizhui himself wore at that age, but that\u2019s another thing Sizhui can fully think about later.\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that more comfortable, A-Ying?\u201d\nA-Ying lifts the hem of his robe to trace the cloud pattern with one careful finger. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he says, reverently.\nThankfully for Sizhui, one single thing goes right today, and the tailor doesn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cLan Jingyi,\u201d Jin Ling hisses, \u201cwhy did you teach him that?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cIt was the heat of the moment!\u201d\n\u201cJust stay calm,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cKids love getting a reaction. If they know they\u2019re not supposed to say something, they\u2019ll just want to say it more.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Okay, I can do that,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cYeah, A-Ying. What the fuck, huh?\u201d\n\u201cJingyi.\u201d Sizhui lets his eyes flutter shut. \u201cToo far in the other direction.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen soothes. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably forget it by dinner. A-Ying, let\u2019s go eat lunch, huh? I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re hungry. Is it okay if this gege in gold carries you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d A-Ying chirps.\n\u201cMe?\u201d Jin Ling says, at the same time.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been complaining all morning that you haven\u2019t gotten to hold him,\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it less weird,\u201d Jin Ling mumbles. But a little awkwardly, he drops to a crouch and holds out his arms. \u201cCome on W\u2014A-Ying. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nSizhui holds the door open for Jin Ling, who still seems too self-conscious to hold onto A-Ying too tightly, and falls into step alongside them. \u201cA-Ying, what do you want to eat?\u201d \nA-Ying peers at him across Jin Ling\u2019s shoulder. And Sizhui sees that odd hesitance behind his wide eyes again. \u201cWant?\u201d \nThe unease that\u2019s been building since the morning shifts, grows roots. \u201cYes,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite thing?\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s attention has turned to A-Ying now, which doesn\u2019t seem to be helping him put the words together. \u201cI like watermelon rinds,\u201d he manages. \u201cSometimes I have dumplings.\u201d\nSizhui hasn\u2019t seen Jin Ling blanch like this since that awful night at Guanyin Temple. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Jin Ling cuts himself off, painstakingly softens his voice. \u201cIs that all you eat?\u201d\nA-Ying blinks, cranes his neck to look up at Jin Ling. \u201cI eat other things,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cBut that\u2019s my favorite.\u201d\nSizhui tries to communicate, with a look over A-Ying\u2019s head, that they should be careful in how they react. Jingyi completely misses it. \u201cSenior Wei\u2026\u201d His eyes go glassy. \n\u201cSenior Wei,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says between sniffs, \u201cyou\u2019ve suffered so much\u2026\u201d\nJin Ling\u2019s looking steadily at Sizhui over A-Ying\u2019s head. He tilts his chin up a little, like he does when he wants to look decisive. \u201cLan Sizhui,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for lunch, too.\u201d\n\u201cJin Ling,\u201d Sizhui says, \u201cthat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLanling Jin can afford one lunch,\u201d Jin Ling says. It shouldn\u2019t be possible for a person to fidget while they\u2019re walking and holding a child at the same time. Somehow, Jin Ling manages it. \u201cHe should have something nice,\u201d he adds, quietly.\nA-Ying\u2019s looking away now, as if understanding this conversation isn\u2019t for him. He\u2019s watching the controlled chaos of the streetside stalls, bursting with color and the smell of frying oil and the clatter of money. Sizhui wonders if he can remember any of the stalls in Yiling, studded with toys out of his reach and food he could never eat. The stalls he wandered as a child, would later wander with Sizhui on his shoulders.\nSizhui had been a little younger than A-Ying is now. But he had Granny and Fourth Uncle, Wen Qing and Wen Ning. He had Wei Wuxian. And they rarely let him notice what he didn\u2019t have.\n\u201cI know a good place, Jin Ling,\u201d Sizhui says.\nJin Ling straightens. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d\n***\nIn the end, they take A-Ying to Wei Wuxian\u2019s favorite place, the family-owned restaurant by the river. It\u2019s not quite fancy enough for Jin Ling\u2019s tastes, but even he doesn\u2019t complain, not when A-Ying looks so quietly happy.\nSizhui orders a few of Wei Wuxian\u2019s favorite dishes \u2013 at a mild heat. A-Ying may well have that same scorched earth palate even at this age, but Sizhui isn\u2019t sure he can look Hanguang-jun in the eye later if he feeds that much chili oil to a six-year-old. \nA-Ying lights up when the food is placed on the table. But even now, with each of them reassuring him in turn that the whole plate is his, he eats in slow, careful bites, looking up every now and then to check their reactions. Even after being coaxed multiple times, he doesn\u2019t finish.\nDespite his best efforts, Sizhui\u2019s getting in his own head again. But it\u2019s hard not to watch A-Ying and think. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t need any encouragement to eat his fill now, of course. He would be the first to tell Sizhui that. But there\u2019s something Sizhui noticed, not too long ago: that whether they\u2019re a guest in someone else\u2019s home or whether they\u2019re eating in the Jingshi, Wei Wuxian can rattle off exactly how much of a meal he\u2019s had, like he\u2019s keeping track. \nSomewhere in the space of going into his head and coming out again, Sizhui\u2019s unease has hardened into resolve.\n\u201cWe should get to the Library Pavilion, right?\u201d Jingyi asks as Jin Ling pays the bill. \u201cShould we take our swords?\u201d\nSizhui glances out the window, checks the light outside. It\u2019s early, still, a little less than half a day until the mountain demon\u2019s most active hunting hours. They should start their research soon. But.\n\u201cLet\u2019s walk. At least to the base of the mountain.\u201d At Jingyi\u2019s raised eyebrow, Sizhui fidgets. \u201cA-Ying seemed interested in the market.\u201d\nSo they make their way back to the main road, and they take the long way through Caiyi.\nIt\u2019s slow going. A-Ying wants to walk this time, and every few steps his attention darts like a dragonfly from one side of the street to the other. Sizhui lightly holds A-Ying\u2019s hand in his own and drifts at the back of the group, letting A-Ying set the pace.\nAnd he finds that he\u2019s stopped worrying that Hanguang-jun will look twice at the day\u2019s expenses.\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Jingyi calls over his shoulder. \u201cYou know he\u2019ll be an adult again by tomorrow, right?\u201d\nSizhui, already setting the paper butterfly in A-Ying\u2019s hand, shrugs happily. \u201cWe can give it to one of the novices.\u201d\nOuyang Zizhen beams. \u201cDid Senior Wei spoil you like this, Sizhui-xiong?\u201d\n\u201cThe opposite.\u201d Sizhui\u2019s laugh bubbles out of him. \u201cWhen we ran errands together, he used to point to toys and ask me if I liked them. When I\u2019d say yes, he\u2019d say \u2018me too\u2019 and keep walking.\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei,\u201d Jingyi winces. \u201cToo cruel.\u201d\n\u201cHe tried to be pragmatic with money,\u201d Sizhui says. That had been Wen Ning\u2019s word for it that night a few months ago, when he\u2019d joined them for dinner in the Jingshi and they told stories of Yiling well past hai hour. \nHe knew he\u2019d have to explain himself to Jiejie if he wasn\u2019t, Wen Ning had said. He couldn\u2019t smile widely, not anymore, but his voice was as warm and steady as the candlelight.\nYour Hanguang-jun was the one who spoiled you, Wei Wuxian had said mournfully. You only met him once back then, but you\u2019d always ask me, where\u2019s Rich-gege? When is Rich-gege coming back?\nHanguang-jun, for his part, had looked at the three of them, the line of his mouth soft. It is easy to spend money when you have it, he\u2019d said. You gave Sizhui joy. That was more valuable. And then Wei Wuxian had hidden his face in his hands until Sizhui laughed and coaxed him to lower them.\nSizhui watches A-Ying balance the toy in his open palm: gentle, barely touching. As carefully as you\u2019d handle a lotus seedling just sprouted from the earth.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jingyi sighs. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Sizhui says, still smiling.\n\u201cYou were thinking it very loudly,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cYes! I suppose A-Ying will need some toys to play with while we figure out how to turn him back into Senior Wei.\u201d\n\u201cYou would have done it if Lan Sizhui hadn\u2019t gotten there first,\u201d Jin Ling says.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cI\u2019m a very strict parent.\u201d\nA-Ying isn\u2019t interested in more toys, in the end. He\u2019s transfixed with the paper butterfly, carrying on a nearly inaudible one-sided conversation with his open palm. It\u2019s easily the most he\u2019s said all day. Sizhui tries not to eavesdrop, but every now and then he catches a word or two. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d A-Ying whispers, like a reassurance. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d\nHe does, however, straighten when they pass a stall of potstickers, the skins golden-brown and gleaming in the midday sun. Sizhui feels A-Ying\u2019s hand tug as he slows, nearly on his tiptoes to look at them. Sizhui idly wonders how much it\u2019s possible to feel at the same time.\n\u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d Sizhui asks.\nBut A-Ying looks away from them then, faces forward and sinks back to the ground. \u201cNo,\u201d he says quietly. It\u2019s not the least bit convincing.\nSizhui opens his mouth. Jingyi gets there first, though. \u201cThen we\u2019ll buy some for later,\u201d he says. \u201cMiss, five pork and cabbage, please.\u201d\nAs Jingyi collects the potstickers, Sizhui keeps watching A-Ying, who\u2019s now looking at his feet. Based on the patchwork of information Sizhui has cobbled together over the past year, A-Ying had been surviving on the streets for some time at this point in his life. Food would not have been a consistent resource. Sizhui remembers enough of his own childhood to know how it felt, having a feast after days of famine.\nBut for the third time now, A-Ying seems hesitant to accept it.\nHe\u2019s still turning it over in his head when he feels A-Ying stop walking.\nStartled, he looks down. A-Ying is as rigid as a prey animal, his eyes wide, his hand trembling violently in Sizhui\u2019s. It doesn\u2019t take long to find what he\u2019s looking at.\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Sizhui calls, calmly as he\u2019s able, \u201cthere\u2019s a dog.\u201d\nThe stray is in an alleyway a little ways up to the left, rooting through the garbage by one of the stalls. It\u2019s little and wiry, not nearly big enough to do anything but bite. But as small as it is, A-Ying is smaller. And biting is more than enough.\nJin Ling straightens, visibly steeling himself. \u201cLan Jingyi,\u201d he says. \u201cGive me a potsticker. I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\nJin Ling is gentle with the dog, but undeniably efficient. He pauses only long enough to hold out his free hand to sniff, to give the dog a few soft scratches behind its ear once it accepts that he\u2019s not a threat. Then he pulls the dumpling from behind his back, lets the dog see exactly what he\u2019s holding. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Jin Ling croons. \u201cGo get it.\u201d\nHe tosses it in an underhanded swing, high and wide so that it lands behind them. Sizhui feels A-Ying inhale sharply as the dog sprints by. Even once it\u2019s long gone, A-Ying is slow to let that breath out. \nJin Ling\u2019s shoulders are slumped as he doubles back. \u201cWei Wuxian owes me,\u201d he says halfheartedly. Ouyang Zizhen soothingly pats at his shoulder.\nSizhui drops to a crouch. A-Ying has shut his eyes now, his body painfully still. Just two weeks ago, when they\u2019d hunted a pack of yaoguai with pointed, dog-like snouts, Wei Wuxian had wrapped himself around Sizhui and shivered, face buried in Sizhui\u2019s neck, until he regained enough of himself to realize that he wasn\u2019t clinging to Hanguang-jun. A-Ying doesn\u2019t cling now. \n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Sizhui asks softly. \u201cCan I pick you up again?\u201d \nA-Ying\u2019s head dips once, barely a nod. Sizhui picks the paper butterfly out of his unresisting hand and tucks it into his qiankun bag with the rest of Wei Wuxian\u2019s things, then lifts A-Ying back up into his arms. Even this close, A-Ying doesn\u2019t grip him back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d Sizhui says. A-Ying makes a soft, unhappy sound, but this time he nods for real.\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d A-Ying says quietly. When Sizhui moves to shift his weight, he notices how loosely A-Ying\u2019s shoes fit around his feet. One stray step and he might\u2019ve tripped.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cThose shoes are pretty big on you, huh? Those must have been hard to walk in.\u201d\nA-Ying glances up at him. His eyes haven\u2019t lost that wariness yet. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says carefully.\n\u201cA-Ying, you have to say when you\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d Jin Ling says. Jingyi opens his mouth, but Sizhui waves a hand to stop him \u2013 there\u2019s no scolding in Jin Ling\u2019s voice. \u201cOtherwise we won\u2019t know.\u201d \nA-Ying\u2019s fist finally curls around the collar of Sizhui\u2019s outer robe. \u201cThat\u2019s okay?\u201d\nSizhui can feel the beginnings of something ice cold clicking into place. Some understanding that\u2019s still beyond him but sits in reach, all of its pieces slowly assembling. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be okay, A-Ying?\u201d\nA-Ying just watches him for a moment, and Sizhui schools his face into something soft, neutral. He may not know exactly what to do. But he has watched Hanguang-jun all his life, has watched him with Wei Wuxian for a year now. He knows that when Wei Wuxian is dancing around what he wants to say, Hanguang-jun doesn\u2019t try to pry it out. He waits for Wei Wuxian to come to him.\nSo Sizhui waits, too. \n\u201cThat\u2019s whining,\u201d A-Ying finally says. There\u2019s something oddly stilted in his tone. \u201cNo one likes that.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve reached the end of the main street now, nearly to the outskirts of town. The raucous voices of the market have started to dim, leaving only their own indrawn breaths for company. \u201cWho said that?\u201d Sizhui asks.\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d A-Ying says.\nSizhui can feel Jingyi next to him, all but vibrating with the effort to stay silent. Sizhui\u2019s glad he does. If they interrupt A-Ying now, he might never talk about this again. \u201cWhat does everyone say exactly?\u201d Sizhui asks.\nA-Ying hums, thoughtful. It seems as if he\u2019s putting the words together more than trying to recall them. Because when he speaks, it\u2019s clear that he remembers them perfectly. \n\u201cDon\u2019t ask for things,\u201d he says. He uses that same stilted tone, and Sizhui remembers where he\u2019s heard it now, listening to the novices recite the Gusu Lan precepts. The tone of a child repeating someone else\u2019s words. \u201cDon\u2019t take too much when it\u2019s given to you. Children look better when they smile. And, um\u2014don\u2019t cry. Crying never helped anyone.\u201d\nSizhui thought he\u2019d kept his face calm. He\u2019d tried to, anyway. But when A-Ying looks up at him, he falters. \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Sizhui says, too quickly. A-Ying flinches, and Sizhui has to breathe before he tries again. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong. Anything you want, or don\u2019t want, is okay.\u201d \n\u201cBut we want to know if you\u2019re in pain,\u201d Jin Ling says to his feet. \u201cSo\u2014say so next time.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d A-Ying\u2019s head tilts, politely dubious. But at length, he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nThey\u2019re quiet long past the borders of Caiyi. \u201cAnyone feel up for a trip to Yiling?\u201d Jingyi says, bright and brittle.\n\u201cThe people who said those things are probably gone,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me feel any better, though.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jin Ling says. \u201cHe\u2014well, it was a long time ago. Wei Wuxian obviously knows better now.\u201d\nSizhui keeps his hold firm but relaxed, enough that A-Ying eventually lays his head on his shoulder. He\u2019s not sure how to put what he\u2019s feeling into words. Or even if it\u2019s appropriate to. They have all, at least once, seen the way that Wei Wuxian smiles in the face of an insult, or an injury, or a reminder of the things he\u2019s done, sharpened to a painful barb. To say it out loud seems like a violation of a secret. Even if it\u2019s one, deep down, that they all know.\nHe doesn\u2019t know better now are the words Sizhui eventually finds.\nHe keeps them to himself.\n***\nThey mount their swords the rest of the way. A-Ying\u2019s clearly getting tired \u2013 by the time they\u2019ve landed at the gates, he\u2019s fast asleep, his head nestled against Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. \nThe sentries greet them politely, though Sizhui doesn\u2019t miss each of them scrutinizing A-Ying\u2019s unfamiliar face in turn. But if they notice that Sizhui is carrying Wei Wuxian\u2019s jade token with no Wei Wuxian in sight, neither of them say so.\nSo they enter Cloud Recesses, at least, without incident. A-Ying blinks himself awake halfway up the path. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunny,\u201d he says.\nSizhui follows his stare to a little black rabbit by one of the lanterns, frozen mid-nibble. He hefts A-Ying a bit higher to get a better look. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bunnies,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can play with them later, after you\u2019ve slept.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d A-Ying mumbles. Then he turns his face into Sizhui\u2019s robes and dozes the rest of the way up the steps.\nTheir biggest problem, Sizhui thinks, will be where to hide A-Ying while they\u2019re researching. They could be noticed, bringing him into the Library Pavilion. But if they try to hide him in the disciples\u2019 quarters, he could be swept up into classes with the novices, and then he\u2019ll really be noticed. The Library Pavilion is their only option, really. Now he just has to figure out where they\u2019re least likely to run into Master Lan.\nHe\u2019s so deep in thought, he doesn\u2019t notice why Jingyi is frantically tugging at his sleeve until Zewu-jun is right there. \n\u201cSizhui, Jingyi.\u201d Zewu-jun\u2019s smile is warm today, only a little frayed at the edges. Sizhui would be happy to see him so well if his heart wasn\u2019t about to leap through his throat. \u201cAnd Sect Leader Jin and Ouyang-gongzi, as well. I didn\u2019t expect to see you all today.\u201d\nWhether Jin Ling remembers that Sizhui and Jingyi can\u2019t lie, or he just panics, it\u2019s not clear. But when he blurts out \u201cWe finished early,\u201d Sizhui resolves to let him do the talking.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Zewu-jun says. \u201cWhat happened with the mountain demon? No, wait, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d He holds up the flat of his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be handling the night-hunt reports while Wangji and Wei-gongzi are in Lanling later this week. I want to be surprised.\u201d\nSizhui diligently keeps a straight face at the mention of Wei Wuxian. Unfortunately, he can\u2019t say the same for the others. Ouyang Zizhen fidgets. Jin Ling swallows. Jingyi makes a tiny, aborted sound that he turns into a loud throat-clearing.\n\u201cAh.\u201d Zewu-jun surveys the four of them. \u201cSpeaking of Wei-gongzi. Was he not with you?\u201d\n\u201cStayed in Caiyi,\u201d Jin Ling manages.\n\u201cHe\u2019s buying a present for Hanguang-jun,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen adds. Sizhui doesn\u2019t bite his lip, but it\u2019s a near thing.\nZewu-jun brightens again. \u201cAlways a honeymoon for those two,\u201d he says merrily. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the secret if Wangji asks. I'm sure he\u2019ll come looking once he hears you\u2019ve returned.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Zewu-jun,\u201d Sizhui says evenly. At least he hopes it\u2019s even. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our leave now.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Keep up the good work.\u201d But just as Sizhui allows himself a brief, foolish moment of relief, Zewu-jun\u2019s gaze alights on A-Ying. \u201cWould you like me to bring this one back to the disciples\u2019 quarters? He looks a bit tired out, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nSizhui could really use a lie right now. So of course Jin Ling and Ouyang Zizhen are determinedly looking anywhere but at Zewu-jun. Sizhui pauses, quick enough to sound natural but just long enough to choose his words very, very carefully.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep him with us for now,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s new, so he\u2019s a bit anxious.\u201d\nZewu-jun looks over A-Ying again. Sizhui\u2019s back is starting to hurt from holding it so straight. \u201cI was wondering why I didn\u2019t recognize him,\u201d Zewu-jun laughs. \u201cHello there, little one. Did I wake you?\u201d\nA-Ying turns his face out to look at Zewu-jun more fully, rubbing at his eyes. \u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201d \nZewu-jun lights up. Distantly, Sizhui thinks of how patiently Wei Wuxian has worked to forge a relationship with his brother-in-law this past year. If Wei Wuxian had known that all he had to do was get cursed, he might have gone out and done so a lot sooner. So it\u2019s probably good that he didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Zewu-jun says. \u201cBut if you get sleepy, let these geges know, won\u2019t you? They\u2019re very diligent. They might be working for a long while.\u201d\n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d A-Ying says. And then, after some consideration, he adds, \u201cYour ribbon is pretty.\u201d\n\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Zewu-jun says. He\u2019s still smiling. He doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed what Sizhui and Jingyi have just now simultaneously realized: that A-Ying\u2019s own forehead is bare.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jingyi says loudly, \u201cwe won\u2019t take up any more of Zewu-jun\u2019s time! These disciples will take their leave now!\u201d\nSizhui barely finishes saluting before Jingyi hustles the three of them off toward the Library Pavilion. A-Ying cranes his neck in Sizhui\u2019s arms. \u201cWe\u2019re running?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cRunning isn\u2019t allowed in Cloud Recesses, A-Ying,\u201d Jingyi chirps. \u201cWe are walking very fast. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think he guessed something was wrong?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says.\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t guess, with you breathing so loudly that whole time?\u201d Jin Ling grumbles. \u201cYou sounded like a winded boar.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2014I don\u2019t think he noticed that A-Ying didn\u2019t have a forehead ribbon,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he assumed A-Ying\u2019s an outer disciple? Zewu-jun trusts us.\u201d After a beat, Jingyi amends, \u201cTrusts you. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get him inside,\u201d Jin Ling says. \u201cWith our luck, it\u2019ll be Lan Qiren next time.\u201d\nSizhui and Jingyi leave Jin Ling and Ouyang Zizhen with A-Ying in a small, secluded wing of the library, and rejoin them a few minutes later with a stack of possible books. A-Ying has happily ensconced himself in the corner with his paper butterfly, carefully lining up a few stacks of books. \n\u201cWhat\u2019re you making, A-Ying?\u201d Jingyi says.\nA-Ying blinks up at him. \u201cWe\u2019re night-hunting,\u201d he whispers. \u201cBut we have to be quiet in the library.\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s cheeks crinkle from his smile as he settles cross-legged on the floor, pulling a book into his lap. He must have known about night-hunting by the time he was A-Ying\u2019s age, too. It was how Zewu-jun had explained why Hanguang-jun was gone so often. But A-Ying would have learned from his mother.\nHe allows himself one more moment of distraction, imagining them. He\u2019s heard all about Cangse Sanren, of course, heard how Wei Wuxian inherited her quick wit and wildfire laugh. He knows less about Wei Changze. But Sizhui imagines that he must have been someone kind. Maybe quieter than his wife, but solid and steady as the earth. Like Hanguang-jun, maybe. Like Wei Wuxian is, and pretends not to be.\nIt must not have been very long ago that A-Ying lost them. Sizhui wonders if he even has a sense yet of what he\u2019s lost. There are things that are too big to grasp. That get easier to understand, when you\u2019re older, but will always be deeper and more vast than you can hold.\nWei Wuxian talks about his parents sometimes, but not often. He doesn\u2019t remember much. And he is, at all times, keenly aware that he\u2019s not the only one whose family is gone.\nSizhui opens his book and shifts on the floor. And he collides with a pair of legs.\nHe tilts his head back. And he looks straight into the impassive stare of Hanguang-jun.\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d Sizhui gasps. Jin Ling, from the sound of it, starts choking on air. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were\u2014\u201d\nOver Hanguang-jun\u2019s shoulder, Zewu-jun flashes an apologetic smile. \u201cForgive the intrusion, boys,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it seemed as if something might be wrong.\u201d\nSizhui concentrates, with all his power, on sinking into the floor. He\u2019ll have to ask Wei Wuxian about a talisman for that if he survives the sheer force of his own shame.\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says evenly. But there\u2019s a recognizable shift behind his eyes. He\u2019s worried. He made Hanguang-jun worry about him. If it\u2019s possible to feel worse, Sizhui feels it. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Sizhui\u2019s bone-dry throat constricts. He has to say it. There\u2019s nothing for it now. \u201cThat is, I\u2026\u201d\nThe good news is, there\u2019s a gentle thump to their right, drawing everyone\u2019s attention off Sizhui.\nThe bad news is, it\u2019s one of the books from A-Ying\u2019s makeshift sculpture. \n\u201cOh.\u201d A-Ying sets the fallen book back into place with a careful dusting. \u201cShh. We have to be quiet in the library.\u201d\nHanguang-jun turns to look at A-Ying. And Sizhui takes a deep breath, braces for a long fall, and says, \u201cHanguang-jun\u2014this is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\n There\u2019s a beat. Then a flurry of words all at once: a Wangji? from Zewu-jun, a How did you know that from Jingyi, a Hanguang-jun, we\u2014 from Jin Ling, and a reverent Wow from Ouyang Zizhen. Sizhui is the only one silent, frozen. Maybe that\u2019s why Hanguang-jun looks at him first.\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d he says. His voice is utterly calm. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Sizhui breathes again, past the block in his throat. He just needs to say it. Rule eighty-four, speak forthrightly. \u201cIt was my fault. There were arrays, to make villagers easy prey for the mountain demon. We didn\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t move fast enough, I\u2014\u201d \nHe blinks. He\u2019s the head disciple. He\u2019s at fault. He\u2019s not the one who\u2019s cursed, whose husband is cursed. There are any number of reasons why he can\u2019t cry here. So he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cJianhe and some of our shidi are tracking the demon now. They have instructions to send a message when they\u2019re close. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d He gestures uselessly to the books. \u201cResearching the array now. We\u2019ll go back and fix this.\u201d He\u2019s still not crying. He\u2019s not. But he\u2019d give anything to regain control of his voice. \u201cHanguang-jun, I\u2019m so sorry. This disciple will accept any punishment you see fit.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d Jingyi says quickly, \u201cSizhui is blameless. It was the three of us who didn\u2019t notice the array. Sizhui was the one who pushed us out. Please punish me instead of him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Hanguang-jun!\u201d Jin Ling blurts out. He looks like he\u2019s about to shake apart, but somehow he manages to add, \u201cIt\u2019s not Sizhui\u2019s fault!\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun!\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says, dropping into a low bow. \u201cThe safety of your husband is paramount to this disciple! I sincerely apologize for letting you d\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. His neutral expression hasn\u2019t wavered. But all four mouths snap shut in an instant. Hanguang-jun never interrupts anyone. \nHe looks at them in turn, as if to be sure they\u2019re listening. Then he says, \u201cSuppression or elimination of the demon should neutralize the curse. Continue your research to be sure. Come to me once you have confirmed.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2026 Yes,\u201d Sizhui says. The adrenaline hasn\u2019t quite left him yet; his hands tremble furiously at his sides. \u201cBut Hanguang-jun\u2014\u201d\nHanguang-jun\u2019s hand rises, then presses against Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. His touch is so gentle, it\u2019s barely there. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he says. And then he closes the distance between himself and A-Ying in two steps and drops into a crouch.\nA-Ying, for his part, has been watching the argument warily from the corner, the paper butterfly resting in his open palms. He straightens a little at Hanguang-jun\u2019s approach, a gesture Sizhui now recognizes as fear.\nHanguang-jun seems to register this, too, because he doesn\u2019t come closer. He simply says, \u201cA-Ying.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s his voice or the name, A-Ying visibly loosens. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you my friend, too?\u201d\nHanguang-jun laughs, brief but bright enough that Jin Ling elbows Jingyi and hisses something that sounds like He laughs? \u201cYes,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cWhat are you building?\u201d\nA-Ying relaxes further. Jingyi was right. If they\u2019d let him out of their sight, he would have been adopted by the first friendly face on the street. \u201cThese are mountains,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re night-hunting.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, so softly. \n\u201cMmhmm!\u201d A-Ying chirps, holding up his butterfly. \u201cHe\u2019s a cultivator. I\u2019m his sword.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your sword?\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\nA-Ying hums, jutting his lower lip out. \u201cDon\u2019t have one. But that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Hanguang-jun nods, as if considering it. \u201cWould you like to ride mine?\u201d\nA-Ying lights up. \u201cCan I?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Sizhui can hear the smile in Hanguang-jun\u2019s voice. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d\n\u201cWangji,\u201d Zewu-jun says as Hanguang-jun sweeps A-Ying up into his arms. \u201cPerhaps the curse should take precedence?\u201d\nHanguang-jun looks over his shoulder impassively, A-Ying grinning in his arms. \u201cMountain demons are most active at hai hour,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we will have to wait.\u201d\nAnd with that, Hanguang-jun sweeps past the five of them and around the corner. In the distance, the library door opens, then shuts.\nSizhui breathes out, stirring the relief and guilt and tension into a fresh cyclone. He needs to sit down. Actually, he\u2019s going to. When he sinks to the floor, Jingyi drops alongside him.\n\u201cAre you all alright,\u201d Zewu-jun says, barely a question. He\u2019s still smiling.\n\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Jin Ling blinks, his eyes wide in his dead-white face. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Zewu-jun says. \u201cIf I may guess: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being punished.\u201d\n***\nHanguang-jun is right, as usual. The array is a simple one, for the amount of chaos it\u2019s caused. Suppression or elimination of the mountain demon will reverse the curse in a matter of hours.\nSo they leave the library after an hour and a half, feeling dazed and heavy. \n\u201cWe should find Hanguang-jun.\u201d Sizhui blinks hard into the sunlight, his eyes watering. Between the reading, the stress of the morning, and the knowledge that Hanguang-jun is, for some reason, not angry at him, he feels more like a liquid than a person.\nThe guilt hasn\u2019t quite left him. Not yet. But he feels a little lighter than he did before.\n\u201cGods,\u201d Jin Ling says hollowly. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t kill me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really not as bad as you think,\u201d Jingyi says.\nJin Ling shoots him a baleful look. \u201cFirst I stabbed his husband, then I helped get him cursed. Eventually his patience is going to run out.\u201d\n\u201cAh, shixiong! Da-shixiong!\u201d \nThey turn to find Lan Xingguo, one of their juniors, jogging toward them, just slow enough that you couldn\u2019t call it a run. \u201cAre you,\u201d he pants, \u201clooking for A-Yi\u2014um, Senior Wei?\u201d\n\u201cAre they back yet?\u201d Sizhui asks.\n\u201cThey have been for a while now.\u201d Lan Xingguo beams. \u201cDa-shixiong, it was so cute\u2014a few of us played hide and seek with him by the woods, but then Senior Wei hid in a tree and couldn\u2019t get down on his own? Hanguang-jun had to bring him down. And then when he was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cXingguo,\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cAh, sorry, shixiong,\u201d Lan Xingguo says. \u201cI think they\u2019re in the rabbit meadow now. Hanguang-jun said if we saw you, we should send you over right away.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Xingguo,\u201d Sizhui says. The junior sees them off with a sloppy bow.\nOuyang Zizhen wilts as they step off the path and make their way across the grass. \u201cWe missed hide and seek with A-Ying.\u201d\n\u201cZizhen,\u201d Sizhui says gently. \u201cIf that was our only punishment, we were lucky.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says mournfully. \u201cCan you imagine him in that tree? He must\u2019ve looked like a little acorn.\u201d\nJin Ling falls into step with him as they walk. \u201cLan Sizhui,\u201d he mutters. At Sizhui\u2019s questioning hum, he adjusts his shoulders, his gaze darting across the tree line in the distance. Finally, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet today.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a little chill in the air today, a promise of autumn. But Sizhui feels impossibly warm. Jin Ling\u2019s concern is rare, but it\u2019s always deep, sincere, unashamed. Wei Wuxian always looks a little unmoored when it surfaces. Sizhui always knows who he must be thinking of.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, Jin Ling,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Jin Ling says in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d He bites off the word, thinks about it a second longer. \u201cJiujiu is going to be furious that I didn\u2019t send word.\u201d\n\u201cThank the gods you didn\u2019t,\u201d Jingyi says. At Jin Ling\u2019s glare, he holds up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. Remember that night-hunt last winter, when Senior Wei was injured and we were halfway between Cloud Recesses and Lotus Pier? It would have been that, but worse.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a collective, rueful hum across the group. Sizhui remembers that night well. Hanguang-jun had won that fight and brought them all back to Gusu, but it had been an ugly one. If they\u2019d gotten the chance to compete over A-Ying today, they might have actually come to blows.\nThey find the small group in the rabbit meadow a few minutes later: A-Ying in the center, patiently feeding dandelion greens to the white and gray speckled bunny on his lap. Zewu-jun and Hanguang-jun to the side, a teapot and two cups sitting between them, their soft smiles twinned. Master Lan stands some distance to the side, his own expression pinched. And next to Hanguang-jun, raptly watching A-Ying, is Wen Ning.\n\u201cUncle Wen,\u201d Sizhui says, beaming. Wen Ning\u2019s presence in Cloud Recesses is rare, and it\u2019s rarer still that he\u2019s brave enough to sit in full sight of Master Lan like this. But he looks almost relaxed, sitting there in the grass. \n\u201cA-Yuan.\u201d Wen Ning\u2019s pale face warms. \u201cLan-er-gongzi sent word of what happened. I\u2014I thought I might like to see for myself.\u201d\nSizhui looks to Master Lan next, vaguely aware that he\u2019s waiting to be greeted. \u201cXiansheng,\u201d he says, bowing. The others mutter their greetings in turn.\n\u201cSizhui, Jingyi. Sect Leader Jin. Ouyang-gongzi.\u201d Somehow, even when Master Lan is speaking, his mouth stays just as thin. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come see how Wei Wuxian has brought this sect to a grinding halt this week.\u201d\nJingyi flinches. Sizhui doesn\u2019t. Sizhui and Hanguang-jun have never talked openly about Master Lan\u2019s feelings toward Wei Wuxian. But Hanguang-jun always made sure Sizhui understood two things growing up. That Master Lan, and in fact any senior, could be wrong. And that you can respect someone and still see their flaws with clear eyes.\nSizhui keeps his arguments to a minimum, if only because Wei Wuxian requested as much. But he never promised not to argue at all.\n\u201cXiansheng,\u201d Sizhui says, \u201cthe disruption is our doing, not Senior Wei\u2019s. These disciples apologize.\u201d\nMaster Lan\u2019s gaze narrows. But at length, his shoulders sink with a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s well-behaved, at least,\u201d he allows. \u201cOne wishes he had been this obedient as a student here.\u201d\nIt is, by Master Lan\u2019s standards, a compliment as far as Wei Wuxian goes. But A-Ying\u2019s words in Caiyi come back to Sizhui. Don\u2019t ask for anything. Don\u2019t take too much. Children look better when they\u2019re smiling.\nHe opens his mouth. Hanguang-jun gets there first.\n\u201cWei Ying is still cautious,\u201d he says. \u201cUnderstandably, given his circumstances.\u201d\nHe lifts his gaze to meet Master Lan\u2019s, and they have a long, silent conversation. Whatever the result, Sizhui can\u2019t quite tell, but Master Lan breaks first.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says at length. \u201cYou have this in hand, then, Wangji?\u201d\nHanguang-jun inclines his head in agreement. \u201cSizhui will brief me now.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Master Lan says.\nThe white and gray rabbit pushes off from A-Ying\u2019s lap and makes a break for it. A-Ying rolls to his feet and starts to give chase. \u201cBunny!\u201d he yelps. \u201cWait!\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Master Lan says, already half turned around. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d\nA-Ying stops so fast, he nearly trips over his own feet. And when he locks eyes with Master Lan, something happens that Sizhui has never seen before: Master Lan stops mid-rule.\nA-Ying, at least, looks more confused than afraid. But he folds into a clumsy bow anyway. \u201cWas that bad? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWhatever argument is going on inside Master Lan, there are no easy victors. He grimaces, and then painstakingly, his expression folds into something tightly controlled. Considering that he\u2019s looking at Wei Wuxian, it could pass for pleasant.\n\u201cNo need,\u201d he manages, eventually. \u201cRun if you wish.\u201d And turning on his heel, he strides off.\n\u201cI should get back, as well,\u201d Zewu-jun says.\n\u201cXiongzhang,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cOne of us should appease Shufu,\u201d Zewu-jun says lightly. The usual weariness has started to creep in behind his eyes. But his smile as he crouches in front of A-Ying is genuine. \u201cA-Ying, thank you so much for letting me play with you today. It\u2019s been a while since I got to spend so much time with my little brother.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d A-Ying says, wilting. \u201cGege is leaving?\u201d\n\u201cFor today, at least.\u201d Zewu-jun pats his head once. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see me tomorrow.\u201d He straightens, nods to juniors, and crosses the meadow after his uncle.\nHanguang-jun watches until Zewu-jun\u2019s back has retreated far into the distance. Then he shifts to face A-Ying, who\u2019s still craning his neck looking for signs of the rabbits. \u201cA-Ying,\u201d he says. \u201cCome sit. The rabbits will return if you\u2019re still.\u201d\nA-Ying goes obediently. Sizhui had thought, earlier in the day, that seeing A-Ying wear his old uniform was as strange as it was going to get. Listening to Hanguang-jun tell A-Ying the same thing he used to tell Sizhui at that age is several magnitudes stranger. \n\u201cThe rest of you should sit, as well.\u201d Wen Ning needlessly shifts to make room for all of them as they sit in a circle. \u201cWei-gongzi, are you thirsty? There\u2019s more tea.\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wen,\u201d Jingyi laughs, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to keep calling him \u2018gongzi.\u2019 He\u2019s six years old.\u201d\nWen Ning ducks his head. If he could blush, he\u2019d be blushing. \u201cSorry, Lan-gongzi. Habits.\u201d\nA-Ying\u2019s full attention is on Wen Ning now, somewhere past his face. He\u2019s quiet long enough that Sizhui almost asks what\u2019s wrong. \u201cYou have sticks in your hair,\u201d he finally says.\n\u201cAh, you do,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cSenior Wen, did you come up through the woods again?\u201d\n\u201cWe told you that you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Jin Ling mutters to the grass. \n\u201cThank you, Sect Leader Jin,\u201d Wen Ning says. \u201cBut it\u2019s really no trouble. And that way I won\u2019t scare people on the roads.\u201d\nHis stiff fingers reach for his hair, ready to feel for the twigs. A-Ying, darting across the grass, beats him there.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d he announces. And with his face furrowed in concentration, he bounces onto the balls of his feet to reach Wen Ning\u2019s hair.\nWen Ning is very still as A-Ying\u2019s tiny fingers work at the knots. Something unreadable flits hummingbird-quick behind his eyes. \u201cThank you, Wei-gongzi.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh!\u201d A-Ying chirps. \nThe bunnies keep their distance, in the end. A-Ying is still worlds more reserved in his movements than Wei Wuxian, but he\u2019s gained a confidence he didn\u2019t have this morning, and with it comes an insatiable curiosity. He picks the grass off of Wen Ning\u2019s robes. He inspects every inch of Bichen, and when Sizhui presents Chenqing from his qiankun bag, he spends another ten minutes experimentally testing a few notes. \n(According to Hanguang-jun, there\u2019s nothing he can summon with his current level of spiritual power. Ouyang Zizhen clutches his knees the whole time anyway.)\nBut A-Ying is particularly taken with Hanguang-jun\u2019s robes, a lace outer robe ghosting over a light blue second layer with an intricately-detailed cloud hem. A-Ying makes at least five complete loops around Hanguang-jun, who\u2019s sitting neatly on the grass with his skirts spread in a perfect circle, to inspect it.\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Jin Ling says, \u201cthe bunnies won\u2019t come back if you don\u2019t sit still.\u201d\n\u201cLet him look.\u201d Hanguang-jun\u2019s face has gone unbearably soft. It\u2019s an expression Sizhui used to see only once in a while. Now it seems as if he sees it every other day. \u201cDo you like it, A-Ying?\u201d\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d A-Ying runs his hand across the embroidery, his own expression no less wonderous than it was the first few laps around the hem. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\nNext to Sizhui, Jingyi stops breathing. Hanguang-jun blinks once, then lifts his head to face them. \u201cJingyi,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s the barest hint of amused. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Wei Ying already knows that word.\u201d\nJingyi nearly melts. \u201cYeah,\u201d he laughs nervously. \u201cThis disciple will be more careful next time, Hanguang-jun.\u201d\nA-Ying starts his inspection all over again, this time following the path of one particular thread. Hanguang-jun\u2019s next words don\u2019t come for a long while. \u201cThank you all,\u201d he says. \u201cYou made him very happy today.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank us, Hanguang-jun.\u201d Ouyang Zizhen, seemingly realizing how vehement he sounded, flushes and lowers his voice. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s Senior Wei. So of course.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d A breeze pushes Hanguang-jun\u2019s hair back from his shoulders, his headpiece glinting in the sun. He\u2019s wearing the same private smile as those unadorned moments in the Jingshi, eating dinner with Sizhui and Wei Wuxian, listening to the way their voices mingle in the candlelight. \u201cI thank you nonetheless.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sudden clatter, then a stumble \u2013 A-Ying has tripped over one of the teacups, and he\u2019s falling. Hanguang-jun easily reaches back to catch him. \u201cA-Ying,\u201d he says, without censure, \u201cbe careful.\u201d Then suddenly, he stills. \nHis voice barely shifts. But Sizhui knows, immediately, that something is wrong.\nThe first thing he can see is that A-Ying has gone white, his body frozen in Hanguang-jun\u2019s arms. His wide eyes are fixed on a spot at the hem of Hanguang-jun\u2019s robes, but Sizhui doesn\u2019t see why until he moves to stand. The cup A-Ying tripped on was full, and the tea has left a dark bloom on the fabric.\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Hanguang-jun says carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. It will wash out.\u201d\nA-Ying\u2019s head jerks, a quick, aborted shake. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Hanguang-jun tries again. But A-Ying has already slipped through his loose grip to his knees, clenching a ball of fabric from his own robes in a little white fist. He dabs twice, hard, at the stain, before Hanguang-jun gently catches his fist. \n\u201cI\u2019ll fix it.\u201d A-Ying looks up, and to Sizhui\u2019s horror, there are tears rolling soundlessly down his cheeks. \u201cI can fix it. I\u2019ll be more careful. I\u2014you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\nIn one fluid motion, Hanguang-jun gathers A-Ying in his arms and presses him to his shoulder. A-Ying buries his face under Hanguang-jun\u2019s chin and tucks himself into a trembling ball, pushing in closer with every whimper that escapes him. Like his cries are a flame to be snuffed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fix it,\u201d A-Ying whispers. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again, I won\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t have to make me leave, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nHanguang-jun looks torn open. Sizhui\u2019s sure that expression is mirrored on his own face. His friends are frozen on either side of him, and behind Hanguang-jun, Wen Ning twists his hands in his lap.\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Hanguang-jun murmurs. There\u2019s a rare thread of unsteadiness in his voice. \u201cThis is your home.\u201d\nIt takes a few more repetitions for A-Ying to hear him, even as quiet as he is. His shivering subsides a little with Hanguang-jun\u2019s palm rubbing a slow, soothing circle on his back, and even his whimpers give way to silence.\n\u201cI can fix it,\u201d he whispers miserably.\nHanguang-jun kisses the side of his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cI ruined it.\u201d A-Ying is almost inaudible now.\n\u201cYou did not,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, firmer this time. \u201cIf you had, that would make no difference. This would be your home all the same.\u201d\nA-Ying sniffles quietly into Hanguang-jun\u2019s robes. And Sizhui thinks, again, of A-Ying\u2019s rules. Don\u2019t ask for things. Don\u2019t take too much. Always smile. Never cry. All of them broken today. And Sizhui has a terrible feeling that A-Ying is thinking of that, too.\n\u201cThis is your home,\u201d Hanguang-jun says again. But Sizhui wonders if A-Ying knows what that means.\nHanguang-jun looks so lost. It\u2019s an expression Sizhui faintly remembers from his own childhood, the first few times he cried. Ah, Wei Wuxian had mused a few months ago, how did Hanguang-jun deal with a crying child, anyway?\nHanguang-jun had let out that soft huff of a laugh. By imagining what Wei Ying would do.\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d Sizhui blurts out, his mouth two steps ahead of his brain. \u201cCan I try something?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Hanguang-jun says quietly.\nCarefully, Sizhui takes A-Ying from Hanguang-jun\u2019s arms, where he pushes himself into Sizhui\u2019s neck in turn. There\u2019s a fine tremble running through every inch of him. His cries, at least, have stopped. But even when Sizhui ducks his head, trying to make eye contact, A-Ying curls tighter, keeping his face hidden.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles again.\nSizhui breathes in, summons every bit of decisiveness a head disciple should possess, and says, \u201cCan you all dig a hole in the ground? A small one.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t need to be told twice. Hanguang-jun uses Bichen. Wen Ning uses his bare hands, quickly followed by Ouyang Zizhen and Jingyi. Even Jin Ling joins in, and makes the most minimal show of hating it that Sizhui has ever seen. In short order, there\u2019s a shallow hole in the dirt at Sizhui\u2019s feet.\nNow the hard part.\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Sizhui murmurs. He doesn\u2019t loosen his grip, but he shifts A-Ying away from his body just a little. \u201cCould you look up at gege for a moment? You\u2019re not in trouble. I just want to show you something.\u201d \nA-Ying is still for a moment longer. Then finally, he uncoils just enough to look at Sizhui. His eyes are swollen, and his face creased from the folds of Hanguang-jun and Sizhui\u2019s robes, but he\u2019s listening.\n\u201cThank you so much for doing that,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to put you down. Will you listen to what I have to say until the end?\u201d\nA-Ying doesn\u2019t hesitate before nodding this time. And as gently as he can, Sizhui sets A-Ying in the hole.\n\u201cLa\u2014\u201d Jin Ling starts. Jingyi flaps a hand at him until he\u2019s quiet again.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cNow, I want to show you something.\u201d At A-Ying\u2019s next nod, Sizhui indicates Hanguang-jun and the others. \u201cThese geges are going to fill this hole back in. Hold really still, okay? That\u2019ll help it work.\u201d\nJin Ling still looks highly dubious. But when Hanguang-jun picks up a handful of the discarded dirt and evenly distributes it across A-Ying\u2019s lap, the others don\u2019t need much prodding.\nWen Ning and Ouyang Zizhen pile in small, gentle handfuls; Jin Ling\u2019s are heaping, overflowing from his palms. Jingyi pokes one of A-Ying\u2019s cheeks, leaving a dirt-fingerprint dimple, and for the first time that day, A-Ying laughs. A tiny thing, just a seed of Wei Wuxian\u2019s.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sizhui says, clapping his hands. \u201cNow you\u2019re planted.\u201d\nA-Ying\u2019s full attention is up on Sizhui now. The lines of his shoulders have stopped trembling. \u201cI\u2019m a plant?\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cKind of. Plants and people actually have a lot of things in common. We all need sunlight, water\u2014\u201d Remembering the missing element, he reaches out to grab the remaining teacup, pouring it into the dirt far enough away from A-Ying that he won\u2019t get wet. \u201c\u2014and attention. Did you know that plants grow better with people to care for them?\u201d\nAt A-Ying\u2019s little questioning sound, Sizhui adds, \u201cThe person who taught me that planted me once, too. He said that with lots of water and sunshine, I\u2019d grow taller, and I\u2019d have lots of friends to play with.\u201d\nA-Ying narrows his eyes. \u201cThat worked?\u201d\nThey may be back in Cloud Recesses. But Sizhui has never felt so comfortable bending the truth a little. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cI have so many friends now. And I\u2019m much taller.\u201d\nSizhui doesn\u2019t dare to look at Hanguang-jun. But he can feel his stare warm at his side. So he keeps going.\n\u201cDo you know what holds a plant into the ground, A-Ying?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d A-Ying perks up. \u201cThey\u2019ve got little\u2026\u201d He splays his fingers to demonstrate.\n\u201cRoots,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d A-Ying says.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Sizhui kneels until he\u2019s at eye level. \u201cWhen a plant gets taller, it grows into the ground, too. And when their roots get strong, they get stronger, too. They can grow to the side, or up toward the sun. And their roots reach so, so deep, that no one can move them, no one can even touch them.\u201d\nSizhui leans just far enough forward to wipe the dirt off his cheek with a thumb. \u201cAnd when we say this is your home, that\u2019s what we mean. We want you to grow here, however you want. And stay for as long as you want to stay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s quiet enough that the tree line ripples in the breeze. And suddenly, Sizhui\u2019s the one who\u2019s unsteady. He has to take another breath before he asks, \u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d\nA-Ying watches him with that same cautious look. The one that warms to new people easily, that smiles at them readily, but never quite trusts the ground under his feet.\nBut then he asks, \u201cDo I have to stay in the dirt?\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s own laugh takes him by surprise. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, people aren\u2019t exactly like plants. Would you like me to take you out now?\u201d\nA-Ying hums. His eyes are still red-rimmed. But the start of a brilliant smile is forming. \u201cHmm,\u201d he hums. \u201cI\u2019ll grow a little longer.\u201d\nHanguang-jun kneels next to Sizhui. That soft look is back on his face. \u201cThen I\u2019ll bring Plant-gongzi more tea to grow faster.\u201d\nA-Ying giggles again, and swipes away the last of his tears. \nWhen Sizhui rises, Jin Ling is scrubbing at his own eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably ruined his robes,\u201d he says thickly. \nSizhui watches Hanguang-jun carefully, needlessly feed the soil. The last of the heaviness in him clenches, once. And then it lets go. \u201cWe have more.\u201d\n***\nThe sun is low and bright, angled into their eyes, by the time A-Ying\u2019s energy starts to flag again. Hanguang-jun takes him to the Jingshi to clean him up. Wen Ning politely excuses himself back to Caiyi. And Jingyi, Jin Ling, and Ouyang Zizhen join the other disciples for dinner.\nSizhui piles two servings onto a tray. And he makes his way to the Jingshi.\nIt\u2019s dim and quiet when Sizhui slides open the door. Wei Wuxian\u2019s belongings have been removed from the qiankun bag: Chenqing and Suibian sit layered with care on top of his robes, waiting for their owner\u2019s return. Sizhui swallows. It must have been hard, for Hanguang-jun to have his husband right there and yet not.\nSizhui shuts the door behind him, letting the cool early evening settle in. And then he catches the low thread of a hum.\nHanguang-jun kneels on the floor by the table, by the sole lit candle in the room, and he is humming the song that Sizhui has known all his life \u2013 the song that Sizhui has just recently begun to understand. A-Ying is curled in his arms in a pair of Sizhui\u2019s old robes, completely asleep. He shifts once to press his head deeper into the crook on Hanguang-jun\u2019s elbow, but otherwise, he doesn\u2019t stir.\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d Sizhui whispers. \u201cI brought dinner. Should we wake him?\u201d\nHanguang-jun lifts his gaze and shakes his head. \u201cHe needs rest,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you should eat.\u201d\nSizhui hovers. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from my juniors yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking I might go back to the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. His voice is as soft as rustling fabric. \u201cThe mountain demon won\u2019t vary its hunting grounds. I\u2019ll go myself when the sun sets. I will need you to watch Wei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sizhui says quickly.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Hanguang-jun\u2019s lips turn up, just a little. \u201cThen you should eat first. Wei Ying may have my share if he wakes.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 then I\u2019ll eat,\u201d Sizhui says, settling the tray and then himself at the table. \u201cThank you, Hanguang-jun.\u201d\nHanguang-jun observes him a moment. In his lap, A-Ying wriggles and sighs. \u201cYou did well today, Sizhui.\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s laugh is mostly an exhale. \u201cTruthfully, Hanguang-jun, I was making it up as I went.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying said the same about raising you,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, drawing a more genuine laugh out of Sizhui this time. But then he adds, \u201cNeither of you give yourself enough credit.\u201d\nSizhui drops his gaze, worrying his hands in his lap. He feels Hanguang-jun\u2019s eyes on him all the while. \n\u201cThis was a long time ago, Sizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \n\u201cSome of the things he said to us\u2026\u201d Sizhui doesn\u2019t know how to say it, at first. But Hanguang-jun has never rushed him to speak. So he takes his time. \u201cI wonder if he still believes them. Maybe not the same way he used to, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d Hanguang-jun runs a slow, grounding hand through A-Ying\u2019s hair. \u201cWhat you know as a child are stones within your foundation. Difficult to dismantle completely.\u201d\nSizhui knows. Has known since the marketplace, when A-Ying said that children look better when they smile and Sizhui catalogued every smile of Wei Wuxian\u2019s in his mind. Has been thinking about it all day, surrounded by the people who made him, those who survived and those who didn\u2019t. The arms have been different, over the years, but Sizhui has always been held. \n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says again, a gentle tug back into the present. \u201cWei Ying was not shown much kindness. It is not something he expects, even now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Hanguang-jun,\u201d Sizhui says. He knows that, too.\n\u201cBut,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cHe knows there are people who believe him worthy of it. People such as you.\u201d\nSizhui snaps straight. \u201cHanguang-jun, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou showed him kindness before you knew him truly,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cYou saw to the heart of him, as you do everyone. It is not an easy thing to give people the regard they deserve. I have always admired his determination to do so. And yours.\u201d\nSizhui can feel the blood rushing to his face. And with nothing to do to stop it, he just bows his head. \u201cAnd that\u2019s enough?\u201d\nA-Ying frowns a little in his sleep; Hanguang-jun runs light fingers through his scalp until it smooths out again. \u201cI once told Wei Ying he gave you joy. You have done the same for him. Then and now. It has always been enough.\u201d\nSizhui can feel his eyes filling. But there\u2019s nothing he can do to stop that, either.\n\u201cAnd Sizhui,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, shifting his attention to A-Ying to give Sizhui time to wipe his eyes. \u201cI know you worry. For me, and for him.\u201d He pauses, lets the words settle into the floorboards like dust. \u201cWhen Wei Ying returns to himself, he will tell you that it is our job to worry about you. I will agree with him in advance.\u201d\nSizhui doesn\u2019t dare to look up until his face is dry, and his breath is under control. Until he smiles, and it doesn\u2019t shake. \u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that, Hanguang-jun,\u201d he says.\nHanguang-jun regards him a long time. Like he, too, has spent the day seeing through fractured glass, the Sizhui of then and the Sizhui of now side by side. \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cThen eat.\u201d\n***\nHanguang-jun leaves not long after that, once the sun has dipped below the horizon and he\u2019s tucked A-Ying into the Jingshi\u2019s bed. A-Ying is all but swallowed in the pillow, the massive quilt. He curls up in a ball, burrowing into what must be unfamiliar softness, and he doesn\u2019t move again.\nSizhui moves the candle beside him and sits by the bed, a few essays from his juniors spread out in his lap.\nHe wakes in the dark, a pair of arms around his waist.\n\u201cOw,\u201d whispers a voice he hasn\u2019t heard all day. \u201cSorry, sorry. You\u2019re taller than you used to be.\u201d\nSizhui blinks, paws at the empty air as he\u2019s deposited onto something soft. \u201cXian-gege?\u201d \nThere\u2019s a low laugh, and then the press of lips against his temple. \u201cGo back to sleep, A-Yuan.\u201d\nSo he does.\n***\nThe first thing Sizhui is aware of is sunlight.\nThis should have been his first warning sign. But awareness is still coming in slow, slow stages. So he tilts his face further into the pillow to snuff it out.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried that, too,\u201d chirps a voice to his left. \u201cNever seems to work.\u201d\nSizhui clambers upright so fast, it leaves him dizzy. But the room finally rights itself: the Jingshi, the bed under him, the empty space where he\u2019d fallen asleep watching A-Ying last night. There are covered dishes on the low table, and the room smells like rice and steam and the tang of chili oil. A ways away, Hanguang-jun sits in a chair, comb in hand and a small smile on his face. And kneeling between his legs, tilting his head back to give his husband better access to his hair, is Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cGood morning, Sizhui,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\nHanguang-jun gathers half of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair to tie up. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei!\u201d Sizhui nearly cracks his knee on the edge of the bedframe in his hurry to stand. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cCompletely 100% normal,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cStill a bit weakened,\u201d Hanguang-jun corrects.\nWei Wuxian lets out a performative huff, but his smile hasn\u2019t dimmed. It\u2019s so wide that his nose is a little crinkled with it. \u201cI may or may not have the spiritual power of a six-year-old for a few more days.\u201d He staunches a yawn behind his hand. \u201cAnd the stamina of one, apparently. Lan Zhan, how is it that I\u2019m tired already?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cYou should rest today.\u201d\n\u201cAiyo, I\u2019m tired of resting.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou boys barely let my feet touch the ground yesterday. I had perfectly good legs, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d Sizhui says. He\u2019s still dazed, his mind sprinting to catch-up. \u201cYou let me sleep?\u201d\n\u201cYou needed it,\u201d Hanguang-jun says simply.\n\u201cWe were about to wake you, though,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cYour friends will be here for breakfast in\u2026\u201d He glances out the window, as if there\u2019s something he can divine from the position of the sun. \u201c\u2026 very short order. You might want to change.\u201d\nSizhui glances down just long enough to catch the state of yesterday\u2019s robes, flecked with dirt, grass, and a little hot oil from the potstickers in Caiyi. Then he makes for the wardrobe in the back of the Jingshi just slow enough that it\u2019s not technically a run.\n\u201cMiddle drawer,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Sizhui says, diving behind the privacy screen.\nSizhui scrambles to put on the fresh robes, and scrubs at his face just enough times that he feels like he\u2019s doing something. By the time he sets the privacy screen aside, Wei Wuxian is kneeling at the table, uncovering six bowls of delicately steaming congee. Hanguang-jun has moved across the Jingshi to the door, which he slides open.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d he says. \nSizhui hears Jingyi, Jin Ling, and Ouyang Zizhen before he sees them, chorusing \u201cGood morning, Hanguang-jun,\u201d in response. Hanguang-jun steps aside, and the three politely file in. Then they see Wei Wuxian, and they cross the room in a few quick steps to gather around him at the table.\n\u201cSenior Wei!\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cSenior Wei, how are you feeling?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cAre you in any pain? Were there any side-effects?\u201d\nJin Ling inclines his head in apparent disinterest, as if he\u2019s not currently all but plastered to Wei Wuxian\u2019s side. \u201cSo you\u2019re back to normal.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just a little tired. No pain to speak of, considering that I\u2019ve just had the world\u2019s most dramatic growth spurt.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d Jingyi says.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Wei Wuxian makes a show of thinking for long enough that Sizhui is immediately sure that he remembers everything. \u201cI remember Jingyi taught me how to curse.\u201d\nJingyi sputters loudly. \u201cYou already knew how to curse! Even Hanguang-jun said so!\u201d\nWei Wuxian uncovers the last bowl. \u201cYou all did well,\u201d he says. \u201cThough obviously I would prefer that next time, if there is a next time, you don\u2019t try to hide the issue from Hanguang-jun for so long. Yes, we want to teach you how to solve these problems yourselves. But as long as we\u2019re here, you don\u2019t have to. Say \u2018yes, Senior Wei.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYes, Senior Wei,\u201d the juniors chorus.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Wei Wuxian beams. \u201cNow sit down. Lan Zhan, Sizhui, come here.\u201d\nSizhui obediently shuffles across the room and sinks to Wei Wuxian\u2019s side. \u201cWhat is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d make you all breakfast.\u201d Wei Wuxian positions a bowl in front of Sizhui. \u201cTo thank you for taking such good care of me yesterday. That is to say, your Hanguang-jun made it, and I watched.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says. \u201cIf Senior Wei had made it, it would look a little more like\u2014\u201d He nods to the volcanic red of Wei Wuxian\u2019s own bowl. \u201cThat.\u201d\n\u201cChildren these days, no taste for the finer things,\u201d Wei Wuxian says lightly, inspecting his congee. \u201cHmm, Lan Zhan, this looks almost perfect. I\u2019m just going to get a little extra\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will get it,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, rising again. \u201cStay there.\u201d \n\u201cAi, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines. \u201cI was spoiled all day yesterday. You can\u2019t spoil me today too.\u201d\n\u201cYou were cursed yesterday,\u201d Jin Ling shoots back. \u201cJust do what you\u2019re told, Da jiu.\u201d\nWei Wuxian points with his chopsticks and starts, \u201cI at least have the strength to walk across the\u2014\u201d \nAnd then Sizhui sees the exact moment Jin Ling\u2019s words land. Wei Wuxian blinks once, twice. Then echoes, \u201cDa jiu.\u201d\nJin Ling shrugs aggressively. He\u2019s gone as red as Wei Wuxian\u2019s bowl. \u201cJust eat your breakfast,\u201d he mutters.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s very still as Hanguang-jun leans over him, placing the chili oil next to his bowl. His smile is spun sugar, translucent and fragile. Then it spreads. \u201cOkay, A-Ling.\u201d\nThe scent of the chili oil meeting the rice and mushrooms wafts across the table, and now that Sizhui\u2019s stomach has caught up with the rest of his body, he feels suddenly, ravenously hungry. But before he can take a bite, he feels the warmth of Wei Wuxian leaning against his shoulder. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cand Sizhui.\u201d\nSo Sizhui looks up. And when he does, he finds Wei Wuxian trying very hard to look stern. But beneath it, there\u2019s something uncertain, almost shy. \u201cDon\u2019t you know better than to take parenting tips from me?\u201d \nSizhui takes a bite of the congee, lets the warmth of it spread through every inch of him. And then he grins. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I, Senior Wei?\u201d he says. \u201cI told you, it worked.\u201d\nThey\u2019ll spend at least an hour at that table: Sizhui and Hanguang-jun eating in silence, the others very much not. They\u2019ll break the rule about making an uproar, and the rule about eating more than three bowls, and the rule about smiling foolishly. Hanguang-jun will pretend not to notice. Sizhui and Jingyi will promise to copy the rules later anyway. \nWei Wuxian will fall asleep on Hanguang-jun\u2019s shoulder. And when the others have gone, when Hanguang-jun pulls a quilt over his husband and settles in to play him songs for a restful sleep, Sizhui will ask to join him. And Hanguang-jun will agree.\nAnd Sizhui will sit at his guqin \u2013 surrounded by the people who made him, the house that sheltered him, and the earth in which he grows \u2013 and he\u2019ll stay."
