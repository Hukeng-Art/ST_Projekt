    "text": "\n\n\n\nBakugou can control his quirk. That\u2019s a fact. Like, the sky is blue and water is wet. He\u2019s not like fucking Deku or that stupid round face who\u2019s constantly throwing up. He can control it, always has. Bakugou prides himself on his control. That doesn\u2019t mean that sometimes controlling his quirk gets a little harder. Like, for example, when it\u2019s the middle of summer and he\u2019s a constant mess of sweat.\n\n\nIt almost burns in a way, itches. It makes Bakugou want to wipe his palms all over his school pants but he learnt a long time ago not to do that. Just because he only produces the explosive sweat in his hands doesn\u2019t mean its chemical makeup changes when he transfers it to another surface; his gauntlets would be useless if that were the case. But no, he\u2019s cursed in the way that wiping his hands on his trousers is basically the equivalent of smearing them in petrol and with someone like that Half-and-Half bastard in their class, he\u2019d rather not risk it.\n\n\nPlus the smell never comes out.\n\n\nSo he\u2019s left to constantly wiping his hands on the packet of tissues he\u2019s packed - in summer, not in winter like everyone else - or just trying to ignore the wet feeling. Neither option work very well though, Bakugou knows from experience. For some reason it feels as though the nitroglycerin builds up if he doesn\u2019t expel it, makes his skin itch, burn, gnaw away at him, but he\u2019s old enough to ignore it by now. It also doesn\u2019t mean that the first thing he does after school is find a training ground and let off some steam.\n\n\nUnfortunately for Bakugou, this summer is particularly hot and today\u2019s temperature is hotter again. Most of the class are constantly fanning themselves. Deku\u2019s got a towel draped around his neck that he knows Half-and-Half was kind enough to fill with ice before class. Frog Girl looks to be fairing almost as well as he is, Shitty Hair not far behind. Bakugou\u2019s dripping with sweat and his palms ache. He\u2019s almost been tempted to duck out to the bathrooms to rinse them off and pat them dry but he\u2019s not that weak. He\u2019ll make it, he tells himself with a scowl, trying to focus on his textbook. Of course, that\u2019s when he\u2019s distracted by a call from the front.\n\n\n\u201cBakugou.\u201d\n\n\nHis eyes briefly flick up to their teacher, lips curled back in a snarl. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nBefore Deku or that fucking loud-mouthed four eyes can say anything about his attitude, Aizawa is beside his desk, slapping down a folder that\u2019s clearly filled with paper. \u201cDo me a favour and explode this.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou frowns, sure this is some sort of test. He cautiously places a hand on the folder and pulls it towards himself, other hand already starting to smoke. \u201cSure about that Teach\u2019?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa just stares at him so he scoffs and lifts his hand, ready to burn the papers just as he\u2019d done to Deku\u2019s notebook last year. Before he can though, Aizawa is rolling his eyes. \u201cExplode Bakugou,\u201d he reprimands, \u201cNot singe. The windows open, by the way.\u201d\n\n\nThe last line is almost a throw away but it has Bakugou grinning. This he can do. He all but hurls the window open before jumping onto the ledge outside. His grin is borderline manic as he unleashes the full power of his quirk, amplified as it is by the sheer amount of sweat he\u2019s amassed. The resulting blast is big, bigger even than the one he used at the Sports Festival. There come some soft gasps from inside but Bakugou barely hears them, revelling in the feeling of relief pulsating from his hands. That unbearable itch is gone and his head feels clearer. He jumps back into the classroom and throws himself into his chair with a triumphant smirk. He cocks an eyebrow at Aizawa but the bastard just holds up the slightest scrap of paper. \u201cMissed a bit.\u201d\n\n\nTwo seconds later the paper is smouldering in Bakugou\u2019s hands and completely illegible. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou doesn\u2019t need to know that the paper was blank to start with, that all of it was. Just grabbed from under the desk and shoved into a folder specifically for him to explode. It isn\u2019t as though Aizawa noticed his dilemma and cared enough to lend a hand. Definitely not.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\nIt takes Aizawa a little while to notice. At first it just slips under his radar but the more Midoriya ends up in either Recovery\u2019s Girl office or the hospital - which is disturbingly a lot - the more he has to call Midoriya Inko. He doesn\u2019t mind that in itself, the woman\u2019s polite and quick to arrive, if not a little too flustered for his liking, but it makes Aizawa sharply aware of the gaping hole. Because yes, he\u2019s become more than well acquainted with Mrs. Midoriya. Mr. Midoriya, however, is a mystery. \n\n\nEvery time Midoriya\u2019s unwell or injured, it\u2019s his mother who comes and gets him. She signed him out of the police station after the Shigaraki incident and even when the whole dorm situation came up, when Toshinori had left the apartment it had only been the two of them waving him goodbye from the balcony. \n\n\nIt\u2019s enough to grab Aizawa\u2019s interest, especially as Father\u2019s Day approaches, and so he finds himself heading down to administration and pulling out Midoriya\u2019s file. Of course he\u2019d flicked through all his students\u2019 papers upon admission but he\u2019d more been looking at quirks and general comments from past teachers rather than emergency contacts. His eyebrows shoot up when he sees that Midoriya\u2019s emergency contacts after his mother are Bakugou\u2019s parents. That, he never would have suspected. \n\n\nHe turns back a few pages to the family details section and yes, there\u2019s a name there under \u2018father\u2019 - Midoriya Hisashi, it reads - but nothing more. No phone number, no address, no job description. Aizawa almost finds himself thinking it\u2019s a shame, Midoriya\u2019s such a loving child after all.\n\n\nHe then realises what he\u2019s doing and scolds himself, letting the file snap shut only to immediately open it back up when he sees something he\u2019d missed on his first readthrough. It\u2019s obviously been attempted to be rubbed out but a slight indentation is still there; a third entry under emergency contacts. But still, there\u2019s enough there for Aizawa to figure when it was headed. \n\n\nY--i Toshi--ri\n\n\nThe phone number in the next column is illegible but it makes him pause nonetheless. Yagi Toshinori, All Might. Midoriya had started to write that? - it\u2019s his handwriting, Aizawa recognises it easily. Why did he have Toshinori\u2019s personal number? Did Midoriya start to write only to realise it would look odd to the school board? Had he started and then panicked, thinking his mother might check the forms one last time before handing them in? Because Aizawa knows that however deep Midoriya\u2019s and Toshinori\u2019s relationship is, Midoriya Inko doesn\u2019t understand the full extent of it. Not that he does either but at least he knows it exists. He also feels it explains quite a lot. \n\n\nAs the days drew closer to Father\u2019s Day, it\u2019s easier to watch Midoriya become more and more despondent. Only by a tad and unnoticeable to his peers, hidden by bright smiles and genuine interest in their plans, but Aizawa isn\u2019t a student. He\u2019s older and wiser and knows all the tricks. But that is definitely not why he stops by a tiny florist located on his street on his way into work that Friday morning. It also isn\u2019t why he asks Midoriya to stay behind after class as everyone else heads to lunch. Aizawa sees Uraraka and Iida waiting at the door but Midoriya waves them on with a sheepish gesture.\n\n\nHe\u2019s stammering as he approaches the desk but at least he\u2019s not nervously twisting his hands together like he\u2019d been doing at the start of the year. \u201cW-what did you, uh, need, Mr. Aizawa?\u201d\n\n\nHe barely bats an eyelid before grabbing the bouquet out from the same place he hides his sleeping bag, dumping it in Midoriya\u2019s incredulous arms. \u201cSomeone told me to pass them to All Might but honestly, I can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya is furiously muttering under his breath, trying to guess who they came from, but he snaps to when Aizawa makes to leave. \u201cWait! Aren\u2019t...aren\u2019t you going to the staff room? C-couldn\u2019t you-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d\n\n\nThe boy yelps and takes off, dashing past him and barrelling up the hallway. By the time Aizawa reaches the staff office, hurricane Midoriya is already gone but his fellow staff are gossiping like the mature, bored adults they are. He has the story all but screamed at him by Hizashi, how Midoriya had bumbled in, thrust the flowers at Toshinori with some butchered, stammered explanation of \u201cthese are for you\u201d, leaving Toshinori stunned while Nemuri had cooed something about \u201cDad Might\u201d. Aizawa has to bite down a smirk because this has gone better than planned; he\u2019s so relieved Midoriya forgot to mention the all important I\u2019m-On-A-Job-From-Aizawa-And-I-Didn\u2019t-Actually-Buy-These.\n\n\nAizawa doesn\u2019t care that Toshinori has tears in his eyes and asks Nezu to extend his lunch break all so he can buy a vase. He doesn\u2019t care that when Monday rolls around Midoriya tells his friends he did \u201cnothing much\u201d on the weekend but Aizawa\u2019s already been bombarded with stories from Toshinori about how they saw the sights of Tokyo together. He doesn\u2019t care that Toshinori\u2019s name gets added into Midoriya\u2019s enrolment file, only in the man\u2019s own handwriting this time. He really doesn\u2019t care at all.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a well known fact that animals can sense storms before they arrive. And although Kaminari is no animal, the same rings true for him. It\u2019s the first period after lunch when his proverbial ears prick up and he starts feeling the static in the air. A quick glance out the window shows no visible clouds and he bites back a groan, knowing what that means: this storm is going to be bad.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that Kaminari doesn\u2019t like storms, he has nothing against them and actually enjoys the thrill of the thunder claps and the beauty of the lightning as it dances across the sky or touches down, but he does have a problem with the way they interfere with his quirk. He becomes akin to a woollen jumper and is completely overloaded with static. Everyone who so much as touches him gets an unpleasant zap, although Kaminari keeps a tight enough reign that it\u2019s never enough to actually hurt them. It\u2019s still a pain though, makes his body feel like it\u2019s running at one hundred and ten percent, makes him restless and more twitchy than normal.\n\n\nBy the time class is dismissed, the storm still hasn\u2019t come, although it\u2019s visible on the horizon. Kaminari wants nothing more than to find an open-field so he can discharge freely but then the worst thing happens: some high up in the administration part of the school declares a storm warning and every student is required to return to their dorm and stay there until the all clear is given. \n\n\n\u201cAw man\u201d Kirishima whines from behind him. \u201cBakugou and I were gonna-\u201d His sentence turns into a yelp when he claps Kaminari on the back and consequently gets zapped. \n\n\n\u201cAh, sorry, sorry!\u201d Kaminari says, scratching the back of his neck before pointing at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s...you know\u2026\u201d\n\n\nKirishima nods but Bakugou scoffs as he storms past, brow furrowed. \u201cLearn to control your fucking quirk instead of making shitty excuses.\u201d\n\n\nKaminari pouts at him but the blond doesn\u2019t even spare him so much as a glance. Kirishima gives an apologetic shrug before racing after Bakugou, muttering something about making ramen and right, Kirishima had finally convinced Bakugou to come to his favourite ramen place. Looks like the storm had put a dampener on that too. Kaminari sighs as he adjusts his bag and follows everyone back to the dorms. He waves wearily at the common room, hears Jirou offer up some excuse, before he trudges up to his room and face-plants on his bed.\n\n\nA few hours later the storm is still raging, although the worst has passed, and Kaminari feels like he\u2019s going to explode, groaning in pain on his bed. Overuse of his quirk leaves his brain without enough electricity to function, but it\u2019s the exact opposite here and underuse is starting to kick into overdrive. He feels like a battery being charged, then over-charged, and then charged some more. Kaminari wants to just let it all out but his room is hardly insulated against lightning and he doesn\u2019t fancy having to replace everything or risk starting a fire. He could sneak outside, but knowing his luck Aizawa would find him and he really doesn\u2019t want to slapped with detention. Again.\n\n\nSpeaking of the devil does in fact summon him, Aizawa\u2019s voice booming through the dorm\u2019s PA system and informing them they\u2019re having a hero lesson now, and they have ten minutes to arrive at Field Gamma.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a mad scramble of students then, everyone trying to find suitable clothes given they don\u2019t have time to collect their costumes from the classroom. Some are midway through dinner, others already in their pyjamas, and Kaminari momentarily wonders if he could just not turn up. Every move brings him pain and he\u2019s so super-charged that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to keep his friends safe should they choose to touch him.\n\n\nHe does, however, eventually decide to join and is one of the last at the training field. Not dead last though, which is a relief. No, that\u2019s Satou who looks horrified but explains he was baking and didn\u2019t want to burn the cake. No one should be this good, Kaminari thinks as he finds a spot a little away from everyone but not too far to be noticeable. He feels like Aizawa is shooting him a look and Kaminari hastily glances away, preferring to look anywhere but at their teacher. \n\n\n\u201cRight, everyone here?\u201d Aizawa asks, leaving the headcount up to Iida before continuing. \u201cTonight we\u2019re having a special training class because of the weather.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeather?\u201d Uraraka repeats in confusion.\n\n\nMidoriya looks just as perplexed. \u201cBut what does weather have to do with-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice stops him dead in his tracks. \u201cYou were the one that made the observation at USJ.\u201d\n\n\nEveryone looks at Midoriya who looks just as blank. His eyes then suddenly widen, whipping around to where Asui stands. \u201cI said the villains didn\u2019t know our quirks because they sent Tsu into a water area, where her quirk would be most effective!\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nods. \u201cCertain quirks can be enhanced by an environment. Some rely on it entirely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike Pokemon\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe murmur comes from Bakugou of all people, though he isn\u2019t looking at anyone else, finger tapping his lip in thought. \u201cPokemon?\u201d Midoriya says, head cocked to one side before making a sharp sound of understanding. \u201cOf course! A water based quirk works best beside an ocean or river. If your quirk allows you to control technology, it would be useless in a forest or desert.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for you to discover on your own,\u201d Aizawa interjects before abruptly turning to Kaminari, who jumps. \u201cKaminari, think you can handle playing a villain?\u201d\n\n\nKaminari blinks a couple of times, confused. A rumble of thunder breaks the silence and oh, now it makes sense. He grins broadly, letting electricity crackle around him ominously. A few classmates back up hurriedly, Bakugou smiles wolfishly at the obvious challenge, Midoriya breaths something along the lines of \u201camazing\u201d and yes, Kaminari can definitely do this. He is, in gaming terms, the rate-boosted character in this map and he\u2019s going to win. The fact that it\u2019s nineteen-to-one doesn\u2019t even bother him, not when he\u2019s allowed to released his quirk at full power. Who knows, maybe after this Bakugou will upgrade him from Pikachu to Zapdos. Now wouldn\u2019t that be something.\n\n\n***\n\n\nWatching from the sidelines, Aizawa blinks when his phone goes off, checking the message only to then scowl.\n\n\nLoudMouth McMic:\nyou\u2019re doing it again shouta~~~\n\n\nNo, no he isn\u2019t. Whatever it is Hizashi thinks he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s not. Not one bit.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nKirishima\u2019s a punctual student. He may be loud and eccentric and get a little too fired up over things that don\u2019t particularly matter, but he\u2019s always on time. Aizawa was mildly surprised to discover he tended to be one of the first to classroom in the mornings but he would take that over Sero and Ashido\u2019s perpetual lateness any day. \n\n\nWhich is probably why he\u2019s raising an eyebrow when Kirishima\u2019s chair is empty that homeroom. No one has a message saying he\u2019s unwell but then no one has seen him that morning either. Bakugou eventually begrudgingly admits to kicking his door on the way past that morning and being met with a \u201cI\u2019ll see you in class!\u201d which sounds all well and good...except Kirishima isn\u2019t here. He never made it that far, apparently. Midoriya offers to go look for him but Aizawa firmly tells him to sit down, that as a hero in training Kirishima has to look after himself and take responsibility for his own actions.\n\n\nWhat he doesn\u2019t tell them is that as soon as Hizashi comes in to teach English, he\u2019s making his way across the school grounds to the dorms. \n\n\nAccording to the school\u2019s swipe card records, Kirishima is still inside the building. Aizawa takes the lift up to the fourth floor, scowling, and he swears if the boy has just fallen back asleep he\u2019s going to kill someone. Probably not Kirishima because killing students is frowned upon, but someone. He doesn\u2019t even bother knocking on the door, just pushes it open and steps inside. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a mad scrambling and some muttered swearing. \u201cI-I\u2019m coming Baku-...\u201d\n\n\nKirishima trails off at Aizawa\u2019s flat look, cheeks flushing, and Aizawa is mildly curious as to when Bakugou became Kirishima\u2019s closest friend. Kaminari would have been his first guess but then Bakugou is his next door neighbour so maybe that explains it. Closest indeed.\n\n\nWhat isn\u2019t explained is the harried expression on Kirishima\u2019s face and the fact that it looks like he\u2019s been furiously rubbing at his eyes, possibly wiping tears away.\n\n\n\u201cAh, sorry,\u201d Kirishima mumbles, fumbling for his bag, swinging it over his shoulder and bowing. \u201cI\u2019ll make the time up-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\nKirishima freezes dead in his tracks before adopting a very poor attempt at a smile. \u201cOh, ah, nothing; it was nothing! I was just\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAizawa forces him to sit with a hand and then leans back on the desk, gesturing vaguely. \u201cYou skipped my class Kirishima; I\u2019m entitled to an explanation.\u201d\n\n\nThe red head starts to speak before dropping his head down, preferring to stare at his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, alright? I know that but...last night I thought it was okay but this morning it looked so much worse and\u2026\u201d a hand came to tug at his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s too brown and...and I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nAizawa swears he is going to throw himself out the window because honestly, is he here, in this room, because this fifteen-year-old cannot handle having regrowth? He would say something but it looks like Kirishima has already told himself the same things Aizawa would say...if not ten times over. And, okay, maybe - maybe - he understands a little. Because while it\u2019s a superficial feature, it\u2019s what makes Kirishima Kirishima. Taking that away clearly does something; damages his self-esteem quite worrisomely if Aizawa had to guess.\n\n\n(He makes a note to come back to that later.)\n\n\nBut on another level, he completely understands. Aizawa has seen Hizashi dressed in sweats with his hair down or in a messy ponytail and he\u2019s still the same person but something changes. He becomes quieter in some way, softer, less likely to scream the house down. Unless there\u2019s a spider or a cute cat video. It must be something of the same for Kirishima and Aizawa doesn\u2019t really have the heart to be angry with him. Maybe if this was third year, but not first year. Not when this boy is just fifteen and has already been through hell and back.\n\n\nShifting his gaze to the desk behind him, Aizawa picks up a rubber band from where it\u2019s wrapped around a stack of pens. It\u2019ll hurt like anything to get out later but he doesn\u2019t care that much. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, Kirishima\u2019s head snapping up. \u201cYou\u2019re all training to be heroes, right?\u201d he continues, making the boy freeze when he starts dragging his hair up, pulling it together and starting to twist it. \u201cIf your classmates can\u2019t handle regrowth, what can they handle?\u201d\n\n\nKirishima abruptly laughs there, clapping a hand over his mouth to smother it just as Aizawa secures the bun. \u201cI guess. Yeah, I never thought about it like that.\u201d He then cautiously brings a hand to his hair. \u201cThis is...cool? Like, I really like it! Why didn\u2019t I think of this?!\u201d\n\n\nHe mutters something about manliness that Aizawa really doesn\u2019t pay attention to, just gets to his feet when Aizawa nudges him with a boot and, frankly, that\u2019s good enough. \n\n\nKirishima scoops up his bag from behind him and catches him in the hall, tucking a stray piece of hair behind his ear. Aizawa gives it a dismissive look. \u201cAsk Yaoyorozu to make something for that.\u201d\n\n\nHe gets a nod and then, \u201cHey! I can do that cool thing with the pins where they make an \u201cx\u201d, that\u2019d be super awesome! And then they\u2019ll look at that and not my hair and-\u201d\n\n\nAizawa tunes him out all the way back to the classroom, hanging back as Kirishima enters because he\u2019s on his way to the staff lounge anyway. He hears Kaminari call something along the lines of, man-buns are manly as hell!\u201d while Kirishima asks Yaoyorozu for bobby pins. \n\n\n***\n\n\nThe kid has a head full of gleaming red hair the next day and a grin to match. It suits him, Aizawa supposes. \n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t know this happened. Well, he does but he would prefer not to dwell on the series of bad life choices that led him here. \u2018Here\u2019 is really not that bad of a place but it does involve a cat, and a stray one at that. \n\n\nIt had started a few weeks ago, with Todoroki coming back to the dorms one evening after spending the afternoon at the hospital with his mother. He\u2019d stopped by his favourite soba place only to step out and nearly trip over a stray cat. It had stared up at him with mis-matching eyes and he\u2019d like to say that that didn\u2019t persuade him in any way...but it did. A scratch under the chin had been enough in his opinion and Todoroki had continued on his way.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s now six weeks later and the cat is still following him. No one else in 1-A seems to have noticed and Todoroki wonders if they\u2019re really cut out to be heroes if they don\u2019t notice an actual, live cat frequenting their dorm doorstep. He doesn\u2019t mind though, not really. And if he\u2019s been starting to pick up a couple of tins of tuna every so often and leaving them outside, no one has to know. Todoroki\u2019s not an idiot though, and he hasn\u2019t named the thing. He knows once Aizawa finds out about it, the cat will be removed from the residence and shipped to god knows where.\n\n\nHe\u2019s happy enough now though, even if his eyes do keep darting to the door. Because he\u2019s let the cat into the dorms and he knows that is not allowed. Todoroki doesn\u2019t even know why he did, just that the poor thing looked so miserable sitting out in the rain and the cold that he\u2019d had to bring it in. Sneaking past Midoriya and Iida had been easy enough and with them oblivious, Todoroki knows he\u2019s safe. He has half a mind to ask Yaoyorozu to make a cat bed but this is not going to continue so there\u2019s no point. At that moment, he\u2019s met with a pair of mis-matched eyes that crinkle shut in something akin to a smile.\n\n\nNo, this is not going to continue.\n\n\nAbsolutely and definitely not.\n\n\n***\n\n\nTodoroki must think he\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s not. Todoroki just seems to think that.\n\n\nBecause Todoroki seems to think that he, Aizawa, pro hero Eraserhead, has not noticed said boy sneaking a cat onto the grounds. Todoroki\u2019s classmates might be a little behind the eight ball but Aizawa isn\u2019t. He\u2019s been keeping an eye on the cat ever since it first turned up and if there\u2019s an old blanket tucked into one of the building\u2019s crevices, that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\n\nHowever, the weather is getting colder now and while Aizawa doesn\u2019t tend to notice - he all but lives in his sleeping bag for god\u2019s sake - this year his students make it so that he can\u2019t help but notice. Asui seems to find it harder and harder to stay awake in class, Bakugou can\u2019t seem to spark up straight away and is more sullen than normal, Midoriya and Uraraka have taken to crowding around a confounded Todoroki\u2019s left side. It makes him think about Todoroki\u2019s cat and what to do with it since the temperature keeps dropping. It can\u2019t live outside forever but damned if he\u2019s adopting it. He and Hizashi already have enough, thank you very much. \n\n\nWhich is why, much to his chagrin, he picks the stray up one day, tucking it into the folds of his scarf. There are some mild protests before the cat settles down, purrs rumbling against his shoulder. His class all dash to their desks the second he opens the door and Aizawa is going turn a blind eye to the cake crumbs littering the floor and the way Tokoyami\u2019s wobbles as though someone very hurriedly climbed off of it. \n\n\n\u201cRight, new class assignment,\u201d he says without preamble. Iida\u2019s hand shoots into the air but one glare from him makes the student meekly drop it again. Aizawa makes his way to Todoroki\u2019s desk, pulling the cat out by the scruff of the neck and dumping it in the boy\u2019s lap. \u201cLook after that.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a beat and then stammering and protests come from all over the room. \u201cFor how long?\u201d Midoriya asks.\n\n\n\u201cUntil I say otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy Todoroki?\u201d Ashido wails.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too noisy,\u201d Aizawa deadpans.\n\n\n\u201cWhy not Kouda?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCats eat rabbits Kaminari,\u201d he answers, holding up a hand when Kouda\u2019s starts scribbling furiously. \u201cAnd straight up telling them to get along is cheating.\u201d The writing stops.\n\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\nThe question comes from Todoroki, who apparently hasn\u2019t noticed that the cat in question has already curled up on his left side and that he is stroking it absently. Aizawa doesn\u2019t want to say it\u2019s because he\u2019s noticed Todoroki struggles with social skills or that he doubts compassion was something he was shown as a child and so he needs to develop that skill now if he wants to be a hero. No, instead he goes with, \u201cIt looks like you.\u201d\n\n\nA minute of silence and then Midoriya is muffling giggles behind his hand, Todoroki giving him a look and Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrow. This is not happening, not in his class, no way, no how. Yaoyorozu saves the moment though, leaning across the aisle and asking for permission before getting in a pat of her own. \u201cWhat are you going to call it?\u201d\n\n\nTodoroki\u2019s face goes blank, like this hasn\u2019t occurred to him. It probably has but he still looks put on the spot. The rest of the class start to pipe up but before they can even finish their suggestions-\n\n\n\u201cSoba.\u201d\n\n\nTodoroki says it so decisively that Midoriya is gone again, head in his arms to try and smother his laughs but it doesn\u2019t help, especially when Bakugou turns to yell at him about the shittiness of the name which only makes Midoriya laugh more. At that point, the rest of the class just accept it, knowing Todoroki won\u2019t change his mind now. Aizawa knows, Midoriya or not, Todoroki wouldn\u2019t have been persuaded anyway. His personality is just like that. \n\n\nThe rest of homeroom is spent playing with Soba and Aizawa pretends not to realise, looking all invested in paperwork when really he\u2019s just scrolling through his phone and catching up on the staff\u2019s group chat. And when Todoroki has the faintest hint of a smile on his face when he leaves the classroom, Soba bundled in his arms, Aizawa definitely doesn\u2019t match it. \n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dorms were a wonderful idea in the view of most of UA\u2019s school board. It\u2019s less of a good idea to some who believe putting the students in one place only makes them easier to target - Aizawa agrees with this one - and it\u2019s even less of a good idea to the homeroom teachers who have to stay onsite nearly twenty-four-seven. They\u2019ve been given their own rooms within the dorms and everything they could ever want - within reason - has been paid for, but it\u2019s hard on those who have families or relationships. Aizawa\u2019s lucky in one way in that he\u2019s made a deal with Toshinori and the other hero covers the nights of the week where his time hasn\u2019t run out. It makes things easier but still\u2026\n\n\nTonight is one such night where Toshinori has strained himself too hard throughout the day and Aizawa has to come in and stay the night. The other man is apologising profusely when he arrives but within minutes he\u2019s being dragged away by Hizashi, who is loudly droning on about being bored and having no one to watch bad television with. If nothing else, Toshinori is too gracious and shy to deny him.\n\n\nAnd so Aizawa settles in at his desk, flicking through exams and essays he hasn\u2019t marked yet. If he\u2019s here rather than home, he may as well make the most of it. His eyes occasionally flick to the monitors that show him the corridors and exterior of the building. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t motion sensors everywhere anyway but he trusts his eyes more. Plus, Kaminari has a habit of accidentally short circuiting things so he doesn\u2019t always trust their technology. \n\n\nHe\u2019s doing a routine check around 1 A.M. when he notices the light in Tokoyami\u2019s room is still on, just visible through the door\u2019s bottom seal. He frowns a little, making a note to cut the student absolutely zero slack if he complains about tired tomorrow during class. Teenager or not, he should still be getting a decent amount of sleep. \n\n\nIt then becomes after 2 A.M. and the light is still on. Aizawa squints harder before pushing his chair out, complaining the whole time. He\u2019s tempted to wake Toshinori and ask if he\u2019s noticed anything similar but he finds the man sprawled out on the floor, Hizashi\u2019s limbs awkwardly splayed over him and Aizawa definitely doesn\u2019t want to deal with that at two in the morning. No, he\u2019ll let them sleep and save some peace and quiet for himself.\n\n\nStepping onto the second floor, Aizawa passes all the other rooms before reaching Tokoyami\u2019s. He raps on the door thrice and is met with scrambled footsteps. Apologies are already tumbling out of Tokoyami\u2019s mouth but they come to a sudden and abrupt halt when he realises just who is standing on the other side of his door.\n\n\n\u201cM-Mr. Aizawa,\u201d he stammers, bowing his head quickly. \u201cI was expecting Midoriya.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa raises an eyebrow at that but ushers Tokoyami back inside, following him but only a couple of steps. \u201cDo you often expect Midoriya this late at night? Or rather, this early in the morning?\u201d\n\n\nTokoyami flushes. \u201cHe...is somewhat insomniac. He joins me if he...can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\nThe way he says it implies that there\u2019s more to it than that but that isn't Aizawa\u2019s concern right now. Not that he has an concerns, he\u2019s just irritated. \u201cWant to explain to me why you\u2019re awake at this hour? And often, from what you\u2019ve just told me.\u201d\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t receive an answer for a long, long time. Eventually, Tokoyami stares at his feet and mumbles out. \u201cI find it hard to sleep with the lights on.\u201d The obvious solution to turn them off is then nullified by, \u201cAnd if I turn them off...I fear what Dark Shadow may do.\u201d\n\n\nSaid shadow hunkers down miserably but doesn\u2019t deny that it may become uncontrollable. Aizawa pinches the bridge of his nose, realising he should have noticed this happening ever since their summer training camp. From what he\u2019d heard from Todoroki and Shouji, Tokoyami had completely lost control and it was only because of Midoriya\u2019s, Bakugou\u2019s, and Todoroki\u2019s quick thinking that they\u2019d been able to subdue him at all. Obviously the wounds from that were still raw and healing, too deep to be fixed so quickly.\n\n\nStill\u2026\n\n\n\u201cIf Dark Shadow is as restless as you say, shouldn\u2019t you be used to sleeping in the light? How old were you when your quick manifested?\u201d\n\n\nTokoyami manages a half-glare. \u201cThis...I haven\u2019t had a problem with this until recently.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen it isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d Aizawa retorts, ignoring Tokoyami\u2019s obvious anger. \u201cSummer camp was what I would call a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d. While it\u2019s true you could do with more training, you cannot keep jumping at shadows.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut what if Dark Shadow grows stronger?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo quote Midoriya, \u201cit\u2019s your quirk, isn\u2019t it?\u201d. Tokoyami pauses, Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrowing. \u201cYou were there before Dark Shadow. He is more reliant on you than you are on him. Your quirk is simply that;\nyours. It can be trained and it can be controlled.\u201d He does though, have a sudden idea come to him and ask Tokoyami to wait before heading to Midoriya's room. He pushes open the door and the boy sleeps on, stirring a little as if he senses something isn't right. Aizawa finds what he's looking for on the third shelf of Midoriya's extensive All Might collection - honestly, there is such a thing as going to far. As he makes to leave, that is when Midoriya does actually stir, rubbing at his eyes and peering at him through the darkness.\n\n\n\"Mr. Aizawa?\" he asks blearily.\n\n\nAizawa simply shows him the object. \"Tokoyami is borrowing this.\"\n\n\nMidoriya nods, slurring out something along the lines of \"...'kay\" before falling back to sleep. Aizawa makes the trek back to Tokoyami's room, removing one of the skulls from the wall above his bed and replacing it with an - unsurprisingly - All Might nightlight. He flicks the setting onto blue, knowing Midoriya's one (because he has two, why wouldn't he?) glows white and a certain someone two floors up has gone that glows red. They probably bought the nightlights together, though the latter would deny having one, let alone using it.\n\n\nTokoyami, however, looks at it in something akin to shame. \"Isn't that...childish?\"\n\n\nAizawa shrugs. \"Midoriya uses one, as does someone else. They might...shall we say, blow you away if you found out, but they do. Towels placed along the bottoms of doors do amazing things.\"\n\n\nWith that, Aizawa leaves, though not without Tokoyami whispering a shocked 'Bakugou' under his breath. He will never confirm nor deny such assumptions.\n\n\n***\n\n\nTokoyami comes to class the next day looking far more rested than he has in weeks. It\u2019s barely noticeable but Aizawa is a pro hero. He\u2019d be a fraud if he didn\u2019t notice. \n\n\nOr at least, that\u2019s the only explanation he allows himself. \n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Aizawa passes through 1-A\u2019s common room that night, it\u2019s to Uraraka bemoaning to Ashido and Asui about something he\u2019s undoubtedly not interested in. He pauses though when he hears Bakugou\u2019s name - not that he particularly suspects him of anything but just in case.\n\n\n\u201c-don\u2019t think he even meant to!\u201d Uraraka is saying. \u201cHe just cut across me while trying to beat Todoroki and got my uniform in the process!\u201d\n\n\nNow that he\u2019s looking for it, Aizawa can see the uniform in question. It\u2019s one of their normal uniforms and he wonders how it got damaged until he remembers the majority of the students having races after class just to challenge themselves. Bakugou more looks like he ran into Uraraka than swerved around her and Aizawa makes a note to review the dorm\u2019s security recordings later; and certainly not for amusement\u2019s sake.\n\n\nBack to the problem at hand and yes, Aizawa can see exactly what makes it a problem. Most of the left side of her jacket is missing, as well as multiple burns in the blouse. Uraraka is holding it up in something akin to despair. It\u2019s pretty obvious why. UA\u2019s uniforms aren\u2019t cheap and it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money to replace this one. Still,\n\n\n\u201cBakugou can replace that.\u201d\n\n\nAll three girls jump, clearly having not seen him. Ashido and Asui are nodding but Uraraka is bright red. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa waves a hand. \u201cHe damaged it, he can replace it.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he leaves, the girls\u2019 murmuring following him. He settles into his room and is just making a start on the hundreds of messages Hizashi and Nemuri have sent during the day - do they even work?! - when there\u2019s a knock at the door. He glances up, not really too surprised to see Uraraka there. He makes his way over, leaning against the doorframe as he pockets his phone. \u201cBakugou being a pain?\u201d\n\n\nUraraka shakes her hand, uniform still scrunched in her fists. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d she admits.\n\n\nAizawa frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question. He-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want him to know!\u201d\n\n\nHe blinks at the outburst. \u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\nUraraka toes the floor, clearly embarrassed. \u201cIf I ask Bakugou he\u2019ll want to know why I can\u2019t do it myself, why my parents can\u2019t pay, because I know he would and I don\u2019t-...I know it was his fault but it was an accident, I promise Mr. Aizawa! If he\u2019d been been annoying I wouldn\u2019t have a problem but\u2026\u201d She shrugs, uncertain.\n\n\nHe understands where she\u2019s coming from. He knows Midoriya\u2019s in a similar boat; he may have the latest All Might merch but his shoes are years old, barely fitting, and he washes his uniform every night. At least his mother had it easier by not having to pay rent when Midoriya first enrolled in UA. Uraraka\u2019s family though...\n\n\nAizawa thinks for a moment before walking back into his room. He finds a pad of paper and scribbles something down. He carefully folds it twice before handing it back to the girl. Uraraka looks at it with a frown, fingers toying with the corners but not opening the note. \u201cGive that to Yaoyorozu,\u201d he instructs.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a beat and then Uraraka is nodding, zipping towards the elevators. Aizawa shuts his door very firmly then, settling down and finally getting back to his phone.\n\n\n***\n\n\nThe next day Uraraka is sporting a brand new uniform, crisp and white. Midoriya is too, even if he looks rather bewildered. Uraraka looks happy though, laughing with Yaoyorozu and sending a thankful look Aizawa\u2019s way when Ashido and Kaminari demand Yaoyorozu makes them clothes too and she responds with a prim, \u201cthat would ruin the economy.\u201d They point at Uraraka in betrayal but Yaoyorozu waves them away, Jirou finally hauling them off her desk when they won\u2019t let up. \n\n\nAt least some things are easily taken care of. \n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most hectic days Aizawa has ever had in his time at UA. It starts early on a Saturday morning, which is never a good thing. He\u2019s only just returned to the dorms after Toshinori covered the night shift and while he slept at home, with no Hizashi to stop him, Aizawa goes straight back to bed. He would probably have slept all day had not a hammering started on his door. He\u2019s already decided to kill whoever is on the other side but then he opens it and, fuck, it\u2019s Midoriya. \n\n\nThere goes his will to kill.\n\n\nMidoriya is sweating and looking harried, eyes wider than normal. It\u2019s now that he\u2019s outside that Aizawa hears the rest of the noise. There\u2019s pounding footsteps, yelling, and many doors being slammed. He sends Midoriya an exasperated look.\n\n\n\u201cIs anyone dying, problem child?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya splutters indignantly at the nickname, cheeks puffing out before seeming to remember what he\u2019s there for. \u201cUh...well, no, bu-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t need me,\u201d Aizawa cuts in, shooing him off.\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s important!\u201d Midoriya cries, ducking under his hand and looking up at him pleadingly. Aizawa sighs but very, very reluctantly gives him permission to continue. Midoriya stares him down with a gaze more serious than Aizawa has ever seen. \u201cKouda\u2019s rabbit is missing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...what.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya backs up two steps but then finds his footing. \u201cPlease! We can\u2019t find him and you don\u2019t have to help, just...is he in your room?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa casts the barest glance over his shoulder. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nHe actually hears Midoriya facepalm, though his face is all innocence when he turns around. Still, Aizawa figures, the boy has got him up now so he may as well see what all the commotion is about. He starts down the hall, Midoriya trotting beside him, and the sight that greets him in the common room is really not what he expects. Half the class seem to be looking for Kouda\u2019s missing pet, another quarter are attempting to...detain Bakugou? Get him to help?? It\u2019s rather unclear...and the remaining quarter are surrounding Todoroki, who has Soba in his arms and is vehemently arguing that his cat would never hurt anything. It\u2019s a sentence Aizawa really didn\u2019t imagine himself thinking back at the start of the year. He\u2019s in time to hear Jirou translate for Kouda that no, Soba did not eat the rabbit, yes he asked, and no, the cat\u2019s not lying. Todoroki looks very chuffed and goes to sit on the couch with a petulant scowl, Soba tucked up against his left side protectively. \n\n\nAizawa takes that as his moment to enter, his presence enough to make everyone stop. And then they all talk at once, making him activate his quirk just to look menacing enough to get them to listen. He points to Jirou. \u201cExplain.\u201d\n\n\nIt is, really, exactly what Midoriya said. Kouda woke up this morning to find his rabbit gone. No one has seen hide or hair of it. Bakugou, apparently, is the only one who\u2019s been outside - which accounts for him being cornered as his classmates want \u201canswers\u201d. His \u201canswers\u201d involve a lot of swearing and explosions but no rabbit. Midoriya meekly whispers to him only that he too has gone outside but he\u2019s one hundred percent positive he let nothing in or out. \n\n\nSeeing that Kouda is becoming genuinely distressed, Aizawa nominates everyone search areas and then orders Kouda to come with him. He seems like he wants to argue but Aizawa\u2019s word is law. He makes a questioning sound when they arrive at Aizawa\u2019s car but he simply gestures the boy to get in.\n\n\n\u201cYour classmates can handle this,\u201d he explains, starting the vehicle and leaving UA behind them. \u201cThe last thing I need is you panicking while they look.\u201d\n\n\nKouda hunkers down, scratching at his cheek sheepishly and this time he doesn\u2019t protest when Aizawa parks them at an apartment block. The walk up is ingrained in his mind and he\u2019s toeing off his shoes before he\u2019s even invited Kouda in, belatedly doing so. Several meows come from down the hall and Kouda quickly takes off his shoes just so he can pat the three cats that come to greet them.\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Aizawa murmurs lowly, giving each a pat in passing before making for the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019s more in the living room and it\u2019s warmer!\u201d he calls back for Kouda\u2019s sake. He only has five cats but...okay, maybe \u201conly\u201d isn\u2019t the best word. At Kouda\u2019s questioning look he reluctantly says, \u201cI pick up strays from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\"Yooo, Shoutaaaaa! Is that you I-\u201d Hizashi peters off in a squawk at the sight of Kouda, his student\u2019s eyes going wide, hastily glancing between them.\n\n\nAizawa just jerks a thumb at the other man. \u201cThis is the biggest stray I\u2019ve dragged off the street.\u201d\n\n\nHizashi makes an offended sound but does come into the living room, sitting down beside Kouda and acting like it\u2019s no big deal that he\u2019s here. It isn\u2019t; it\u2019s his house too. With the veritable small army of cats surrounding him, it doesn\u2019t take Kouda long to calm down. Aizawa can visibly see his nerves settle and before long his student is friends with all his cats, patting them all and spoiling each one rotten. Aizawa just drops onto the couch, flipping the tv on and changing the channels until Hizashi grabs his arm, clearly seeing something he likes. Aizawa doesn\u2019t know what it is but he leaves it on, smiling the tiniest bit when his oldest cat curls up on his lap. This is how a Saturday should be spent.\n\n\n***\n\n\nThree hours later they get the text. Kouda\u2019s rabbit had been find by Shinsou Hitoshi, of all people, the boy having been taking a nap in one of the school\u2019s gardens only to wake up and find a rabbit curled into his side. He\u2019d texted Midoriya, who\u2019d bolted across the grounds and then confirmed said rabbit\u2019s identity with Hagakure - who played with it daily. How it got out was still a mystery...until Iida realises he left the window in one of the study rooms open and Aizawa has never seen a man bow so low. \n\n\nEh, worth it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAizawa is a pro hero. Because of that, he is very attuned to things. Years of working as a hero, and a teacher, has taught him to notice when there are even the slightest changes in his surroundings, his friends, or the very atmosphere around him.\n\n\nHe attributes that to why he notices minutes into homeroom that Hagakure isn\u2019t quite herself. Her posture is a little more slumped than normal and instead of her hands resting in her lap, they are more wrapped around her mid-section. Really, with her invisibility it\u2019s nearly impossible to make out but that\u2019s what sets him apart from his students. Picking up what is definitely a cringe and hands twisting tighter into the sides of her uniform, Aizawa is suddenly pretty sure he knows what the problem is.\n\n\nUnfortunately, he can\u2019t make his move until lunch, lest he embarrass the girl. Todoroki, Yaoyorozu, and Iida are always the first ones back after lunch, though Todoroki is occasionally late if he\u2019s gotten caught up with Midoriya somewhere along the line. He hasn\u2019t today, so Aizawa is able to catch both him and Yaoyorozu at the back of the classroom. Iida is too polite to eavesdrop and Aizawa is thankful as he requests Yaoyorozu to make two objects, immediately passing one to Todoroki to warm.\n\n\nThey just finish when the rest of the class returns, Aizawa taking the items with a grunt of thanks and nodding to Cementoss as he enters the room to take the next class. Snagging Hagakure before she slips inside, Aizawa makes sure they are definitely alone before handing her everything in his hands, as well as some of the painkillers he\u2019s been on ever since the USJ incident. \n\n\nThe instant she takes opens her hands to look, Aizawa swears he hears a sniff. \u201cThank you,\u201d Hagakure says and yes, that\u2019s a sniff.\n\n\nAizawa rolls his eyes, tapping the thin heating pad. \u201cYaoyorozu made that adhesive and thin enough that it\u2019ll fit under your uniform without being obvious and Todoroki\u2019s already heated it up.\u201d\n\n\nHagakure\u2019s hairband bounces up and down, indicating that she\u2019s nodding. She downs the painkillers like a trooper and then hugs the chocolate bar to her chest. \u201cMr. Aizawa, this is my favourite one. Did you know that?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa shakes his head but it\u2019s a lie. In his defense, he\u2019s had these kids nearly a year now and they\u2019ve been in the dorms five months. It would be more shameful if he didn\u2019t know their favourites.\n\n\n\u201cJust go to class,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAnd Hagakure,\u201d he calls as an afterthought. \u201cIf you wake tomorrow and feel the same way, just let me know. I\u2019ll write up a sick note.\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019s definitely crying now and Aizawa sighs when her body slams into his. Honestly, periods are nightmares - he\u2019s heard enough from Nemuri over his time - and the students of his that get them deserve a little slack. God knows they suck it up enough to warrant a break now and then.\n\n\n\u201cGet to class,\u201d he scolds lightly, relieved when that makes Hagakure let go.\n\n\n\u201cThanks Mr. Aizawa!\u201d she calls as she heads inside.\n\n\nWell, at least her quirk prevents anyone from knowing she was crying. \n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s flipping through the results of 1-A\u2019s latest assignments, pausing ever so slightly at some of them, when the one student he\u2019s actually considering pulling aside arrives at the staffroom door. Knocking Mic\u2019s elbow off his shoulder and consequently causing him to stumble, he jerks a thumb towards a room down the hall. With a resigned look, Sero Hanta heads that way. His shoulders are hunched inwards more than Aizawa would like and, given the failing grade he\u2019d just seen, he wants to know why.\n\n\nHe sits himself in a chair and waits for Sero to take the one opposite. He doesn\u2019t say \u201ccan I help you?\u201d but his raised eyebrow says it for him. Sero twists his hands together before saying the one thing Aizawa probably doesn\u2019t expect:\n\n\n\u201cIs it possible to transfer out of the hero course?\u201d\n\n\nOut, not in. Aizawa doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever heard that question before. The answer is, obviously, yes but he pretends to mull on it, leaning back in his chair. \u201cAnd your reasons are\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nSero shrugs. \u201cI just...I think there are students that deserve the place more than me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKaminari and Mina, as well as Aoyama, all place lower than you in terms of grades. Are you suggesting I remove them from the class too?\u201d\n\n\nSero frantically shakes his head, arms flailing. \u201cN-no, no! They\u2019re trying really hard and Kaminari\u2019s actually studying now!\u201d\n\n\nThat, Aizawa thinks to himself, probably has something to do with the fact that the staff are now aware of his learning difficulties - i.e. his dyslexia and short term memory problems - and are implementing strategies to work alongside that. Anyone can learn once given the proper environment and method. Still, it doesn\u2019t answer why Sero wants to leave. Sero must realise that too, hunkering down and almost scarlett when his next words come out.\n\n\n\u201cAnd...well, I feel like I\u2019m letting the class down. I mean, if you look at the Sports Festival-\u201d\n\n\nAizawa winces because how can he not after Todoroki pulled that?\n\n\n\u201c-and even the end of semester exams. I...I was no help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut your team did pass,\u201d he points out. \u201cYour partner was able to escape the challenge and call for help.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s Sero\u2019s turn to frown. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t all there was to it because you failed me!\u201d\n\n\nAizawa has to admit he\u2019s right; he did fail Sero on account of him being rendered useless so early in the fight. \u201cI failed you because I felt you had options you didn\u2019t use. Racing headlong into a battle without assessing options isn\u2019t smart. If you had displayed even one alternate strategy, or even attempted strategy, you would have passed.\u201d\n\n\nTo his chagrin, although he should have expected it, Sero slumps down more. \u201cSo...you\u2019ll transfer me out?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nSero\u2019s head snaps up so fast Aizawa\u2019s surprised he doesn\u2019t get whiplash. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fail people who have potential.\u201d Aizawa pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cGod knows, if I did, Midoriya would have been expelled on the first day and saved us all a mountain of trouble.\u201d\n\n\nSero\u2019s jaw drops open like he can\u2019t believe his teacher just said that about another student before trying to hide laughs behind his hand. Aizawa gives him a moment before steepling his fingers together, locking gazes. \u201cWho would you say is the strongest in the class?\u201d\n\n\nThe question catches Sero off guard, though he barely has to think about the answer. \u201cUh...Todoroki? Maybe Bakugou?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nods in agreement. \u201cGoing back to the Sports Festival, do you think a hero would want to employ a sidekick who throws around full scale attacks as thoughtlessly as Todoroki did?\u201d\n\n\nHe sees the moment Sero\u2019s brain careens to a halt.\n\n\n\u201cAnd with the final exams...there was nearly a sixth student placed in remedial classes. In hindsight, I should have - just to stop him getting into a mess.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d Sero demands, eyes wide. Those eyes only widen further when Aizawa corrects him.\n\n\n\u201cBakugou.\u201d His next words are more to himself than Sero but they need saying, he thinks. \u201cBakugou flat out refused to work with his partner and very nearly got them both eliminated. He recklessly raced into battle against a foe he had no chance of defeating and didn\u2019t want to listen to any other plans of attack. He openly attacked his teammate.\u201d\n\n\nSero freezes and huh, perhaps no one else knew that. Aizawa mentally shrugs; he can\u2019t do anything about it now.\n\n\n\u201cHis only saving grace was that he did, eventually, show a semblance of teamwork and lowered his pride enough to accept help. And,\u201d Aizawa adds, getting to his feet. \u201cAlthough it was Midoriya, had I been paired with Endeavour, I may have done the same. I can hardly scold Bakugou for something I would do.\u201d\n\n\nSero openly laughs there, though more in disbelief than anything else. It\u2019s not everyday they hear the number one hero get so openly badmouthed. \n\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here, it shows me you know you can do better. Stop looking at your classmates\u2019 backs and improve at your own pace.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa leaves the room before Sero can respond but he catches the boy later coercing Ojiro into giving him extra hand-to-hand lessons and trying to keep up as Midoriya breaks down a recorded fight between All Might and four villains. It\u2019s a step in the right direction and that\u2019s enough for Aizawa.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nIida is always the first one to class in the morning. Aizawa has come to accept that. He almost wonders if Nezu has been opening the school building earlier to accommodate this. However, that\u2019s not Aizawa\u2019s issue at the moment. Iida being the first on site isn\u2019t cause for concern but when he\u2019s been staying behind after everyone has left of an afternoon for three days, that\u2019s when Aizawa\u2019s frown deepens a little.\n\n\nHe watches, on day number four, as Midoriya tries to persuade Iida to come out with him, Uraraka, and Todoroki. Todoroki jumps like he had no idea he was a part of whatever this is but Iida politely declines. Midoriya frowns, and that\u2019s a hard look on the boy, and waves everyone else off before murmuring something only Iida can hear. The student has the gall to look mildly ashamed but whatever he says next soothes Midoriya enough that he leaves, hoisting his bag over his shoulder and playfully hip-checking Uraraka as they exit. Their laughter disappears and Aizawa sighs from his position behind his desk. He really needs a pay-rise.\n\n\nHe makes his way down the aisle between the desks before stopping just before Iida\u2019s. The student looks up and actually looks like he wants to question why Aizawa\u2019s there, like this isn\u2019t his classroom and school is out for the day.\n\n\n\u201cAny reason you\u2019ve been staying behind?\u201d he drawls.\n\n\nIida prefers to look at his desk than at him. \u201cI am simply thinking some things over and the dorms can be too loud. Plus, Midoriya has the spare key to my room,\u201d he adds in a mutter.\n\n\nAizawa snorts. \u201cProblem child.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI...That is not what I meant to imply!\u201d Iida stammers, arms hastily chopping the air. \u201cMidoriya is a wonderful student and a very kind friend. He is merely looking out for me and I value his concern!\u201d\n\n\nAizawa waves a hand tiredly. \u201cI hear enough of this from All Might; I\u2019d rather not hear it from you. No, instead, why are you here Iida? That\u2019s what I asked you first.\u201d\n\n\nIida\u2019s jaw drops momentarily as if suddenly realising he never truly answered and goes to apologise but Aizawa narrows his gaze warningly. It does the trick and Iida slumps slightly in his chair. He stares adamantly as the closed textbook in front of him, as though it may hold answers but deep down he knows it doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cThere is a dilemma I have been facing,\u201d he finally says. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue I won\u2019t have to face for another six months or so however I have been dwelling on it recently. I don\u2019t want to be caught off caught like I was last time.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa raises an eyebrow and shifts so he can lean against the desk closest. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur hero names,\u201d Iida admits, hands curling into fists. \u201cWhen Midnight asked us to choose names...I became rather...unsure of myself, shall we say. Todoroki was in a similar position and I do not know if he has yet reached a decision. I have...That is, my brother has asked me to take over his duties and to make the name Ingenium my own but\u2026\u201d Iida\u2019s jaw clenched as his hands shook. \u201cI do not think I am worthy of that title. Not after my actions in Hosu. And my actions in Kamino were hardly any better.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIngenium is a title that comes with large shoes to fill,\u201d Aizawa says flatly, emotionlessly. \u201cHe was a popular hero who did his job to the best of his ability.\u201d\n\n\nIida nods sharply. \u201cExactly! Which is why-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you not have similar goals?\u201d\n\n\nIida stops suddenly, eyes flicking up in confusion. \u201cSir?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour reason for being a hero...It\u2019s to be like your brother, isn't it?\u201d A nod. \u201cThen use his name, not to become Ingenium but as a reminder of why you became a hero. Use it as a goal to walk towards, an impossible finish line.\u201d Aizawa shrugs as he pushes off the desk and makes for the door. \u201cWho knows, you may end up crossing that line without even realising it.\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s out of the classroom before he hears the scraping of a chair and hastily \u2018thank you!\u2019s being yelled after him but Aizawa tunes them out, reaching for his phone instead and opening the messages that have been coming through near incessantly. They\u2019re all photos of his cats and Aizawa can\u2019t help but smile there.\n\n\n***\n\n\nA week or so later Aizawa walks into the common room on a weekend to find Iida and Midoriya in matching hoodies which is...disturbing if nothing else. It\u2019s one thing to see Midoriya decked out in hero merch, another to see Iida doing the same - even if it is Ingenium merch. Midoriya is raptly listening as Iida tells story after story about his brother; he\u2019s so immersed in it he\u2019s basically gone from sitting next to Todoroki to sitting on him, seeing as how the other boy had made the poor decision of sitting between the two. \n\n\nStill, as odd as it is, it\u2019s worth it when he hears the words, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to make my hero name Ingenium, it makes sense that I should get used to seeing the initials on me!\u201d\n\n\nIt does make sense, he supposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s all bullshit. At least, in Aizawa\u2019s opinion anyway. They already have the Sports Festival. Why do they need to have a Sports Day? Right, to facilitate camaraderie and friendship between the classes. To give the students the opportunity to do something that is plain, honest fun. No strings attached, no showing off to the world, no real prizes besides bragging rights. Just a day outside, competing and having fun. \n\n\nAizawa hates it. Loathes it in fact. \n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need a day where his class just sit outside and inevitably bicker with each other and Bakugou gets too over-competitive. He\u2019d rather give them a day off and just let them sleep and have video game tournaments. At least that way he\u2019d get to sleep too. But no, he\u2019s stuck with this.\n\n\nAizawa is also stuck with this in more ways than one because homeroom has descended into his students fighting over who gets to compete in what event. There\u2019s everything from relay races to tug-of-war and the problem lies in that each student can only compete in one event, save the all-in class challenges.\n\n\nAnd this is where the fighting has begun. \n\n\nNo one can agree on who\u2019s competing in what and it\u2019s making things heated. If they were being marked on teamwork right now - as in, if this was a rescue simulation - he\u2019d fail all of them. Huh, maybe he should mention that. He doesn\u2019t though because he\u2019s distracted by Yaoyorozu, who is standing by the front and nervously clutching her hands together and shifting her weight from foot to foot. Her mouth keeps opening and closing like she has something to say but backs down last minute every time.\n\n\nAizawa suppresses a roll of his eyes. Did the end of semester exams teach her nothing? And so he snaps a finger in her direction, catching the student\u2019s attention. \u201cAre you assistant class rep or not?\u201d\n\n\nYaoyorozu flushes. \u201cThat\u2019s...Well, yes, but they don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey listen to Iida,\u201d he points out.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he often has good points,\u201d Yaoyorozu counters.\n\n\nAizawa meets her gaze dispassionately. \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s loud.\u201d He then tacks on dryly, \u201cAnd you\u2019re top of this class in academics. Don\u2019t you think your ideas might be good too?\u201d\n\n\nYaoyorozu blinks at him a couple of times before squaring her shoulders, nodding. As he watches, she then creates a large gavel, picking it up and swinging it down. The sound reverberates through the room, everyone whipping around and looking at Yaoyorozu in surprise. For a moment Aizawa thinks she\u2019s going to crack but then she holds her ground, creating a piece of chalk and walking to the board.\n\n\n\u201cI have a plan, so please sit down while I explain it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTch, and why should I listen to-\u201d\n\n\nYaoyorozu then does the unthinkable: she talks over Bakugou. \u201cI\u2019m assistant class rep, Bakugou. Please listen before deciding if I am right or wrong.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou stares at her like she grew a second head before sliding into his seat. He maintains eye contact the whole time but Yaoyorozu does her best not to waver. Instead, she gives a nod of thanks and begins to write names next to the events already listed on the board. The result is same as the one Aizawa would have chosen, which is commendable. It\u2019s the perfect balance - strong carrying the weak in some cases, and the best being saved for where they\u2019re most needed.\n\n\n\u201cAny objections?\u201d Yaoyorozu asks.\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s shaking their heads except for Bakugou, who is rounding on Midoriya and, \u201cWhy the hell are you paired with Shitty Hair?! Fuck that Ponytail, I\u2019ll do tug-of-war!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya is stronger than you and you\u2019re faster than him; you\u2019re best suited for the relay,\u201d Yaoyorozu points out, even as Bakugou kicks Midoriya\u2019s desk sullenly.\n\n\n\u201cThen put fucking Shark Face in the relay,\u201d he grumbles under his breath and across the room Kirishima goes pink. Aizawa is not going to touch that with a ten foot pole, no way in hell. Instead he says,\n\n\n\u201cExcellent work Yaoyorozu.\u201d\n\n\nShe beams and practically skips back to her desk. All\u2019s well that ends well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool that you have a brother and a sister though!\u201d Midoriya is saying as the class pile onto the bus, heading for Training Ground Beta. \u201cI only have a mum.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiles sheepishly there and Asui returns it. Uraraka, however, makes a scandalised sound. \u201cMidoriya Izuku, what would All Might say?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya abruptly chokes and flushes right to the top of his collar. \u201cI-I mean...I have a mum and a d-dad,\u201d he corrects.\n\n\nUraraka nods in satisfaction and gestures for Asui to continue the conversation. She does so easily enough, shuffling over so Iida can sit beside her. \u201cIt is, kero. But before UA had dorms I used to look after them; our parents always worked late. I wonder who looks after them now...\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya sinks down guiltily while Uraraka lays a hand on her friend\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure they look after each other Tsuyu.\u201d\n\n\nAsui nods after a moment and then the bus starts up. From there it\u2019s Kaminari and Jirou fighting over the aux cord, Midoriya and friends trying to coerce Todoroki to play a game with them, and the others just enjoying the ride. Aizawa doesn\u2019t want to admit that the conversation he just heard sticks in his mind though. After all, it isn\u2019t any of his business.\n\n\n***\n\n\nOf course, now that he\u2019s looking for it; he notices. He notices Asui making a week\u2019s worth of lunches for her siblings every weekend, sees her poring over elementary school coursework so she can keep track of what they\u2019re learning, hell, Aizawa\u2019s even seen her come in with their uniforms and give them a quick wash and iron. \n\n\nAizawa will admit, he doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. He has Hizashi - an adult, though sometimes debatable - five cats - who look after themselves - and his kids, who, again, are old enough to look after themselves...for the most part. Plus, they\u2019re at the dorms ninety percent of the time so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about things like chores and homework and lunches. They can all - again, except maybe Hizashi - function without him playing an active role. From what he\u2019s seeing now though, it\u2019s obvious that Asui Samidare and Satsuki can\u2019t. \n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what Asui\u2019s parents do, he doesn\u2019t even care, but what he does care about is how much pressure is being placed on one of his students. Maybe it\u2019s mean and maybe it\u2019s not but he sends an email anyway, informing Asui\u2019s parents that he\u2019s noticed some concerning patterns and to perhaps get their act together.\n\n\nAizawa also, as much as he hates himself for it, catches Asui when she next ducks out to go and visit her family. He shoves two bags in her hands.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open them. They\u2019re not for you.\u201d\n\n\nAsui makes a confused sound but goes on her way. Aizawa likes that about her.\n\n\nAfter all, nobody else in 2-A needs to that he made ten frog-themed bento lunch boxes. Nobody.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAizawa considers the situation done and dusted and promptly ignores its entire existence. It doesn\u2019t help him. Doesn\u2019t help him one bit because just over two weeks later, Asui comes to the dorms with her siblings in tow. Both Samidare and Satsuki have made him thank you cards and, to top it off, have made him a cat themed lunch. Aizawa takes it and pastes a terribly fake grin on his face.\n\n\n\u201cThanks kids,\u201d he grumbles.\n\n\nAsui turns to her brother and sister with a big smile. \u201cThat means he\u2019s really happy.\u201d\n\n\nNo it doesn\u2019t. And he\u2019s not.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s passed midnight and Aizawa is chasing the last of the students to bed. It\u2019s technically the weekend so they\u2019re allowed out of their rooms passed the usual 10 P.M. but they still have to be in their own dorms by midnight. So far he\u2019s found Kirishima and Kaminari hiding under a desk in one of the study rooms after apparently thinking it would be funny to send Bakugou a glitter bomb in the mail - it was, and then suddenly wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s shooed Satou and Yaoyorozu from the kitchen and picked Midoriya up from where he\u2019d fallen asleep on the stairs, immersed in some news article related to the vigilante, the Crawler. \n\n\nThe last rooms to check are the bathrooms and laundry and they\u2019re usually pretty safe but they obviously aren\u2019t tonight because why would they be? The bathrooms are empty - and clean, thank god - but it\u2019s when he gets to the laundry that Aizawa encounters a problem.\n\n\nBecause there, in the middle of the laundry floor, is Ashido, bawling her eyes out as her washing spins round and round in the dryer. Papers and pens are scattered all over the floor and Aizawa counts no less than four open textbooks. Considering exam week is the week after next, it isn\u2019t hard to put two and two together.\n\n\nSighing, Aizawa steps into the room. Ashido\u2019s head snaps up and she freezes upon seeing him. The next second she just gives up completely and goes back to wailing. It grates on his ears a little but he does his best to ignore it. He flips through Ashido\u2019s notes idly, wincing at their disorganisation. He can\u2019t even figure out which subject she\u2019s trying to study for.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you study with Bakugou?\u201d\n\n\nAshido shakes her head. \u201cBakugou stopped his study sessions because he has to go to physical therapy instead. I don\u2019t blame him!\u201d Ashido adds quickly, \u201cHe got hurt so bad! But Yaoyorozu already has a study group and Midoriya already has his and Bakugou\u2019s study group just...disbanded.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKaminari? Sero? What are they doing, and Kirishima?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKaminari gets it now!\u201d Ashido cries, rubbing at her eyes tiredly. \u201cSince he\u2019s gotten help with his dyslexia he can sit and listen and Kirishima and Sero were always kind of better so now they just...study on their own.\u201d The words end in a sniff.\n\n\nAizawa studies her notebook again, still trying to decode her handwriting. \u201cAnd have you spoken to them about this? Asked for help?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThen that\u2019s-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t rely on them forever!\u201d Ashido cuts in. \u201cOne day they won\u2019t be around and so...I need to learn how to do this myself.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s a valid point, Aizawa mulling it over before sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s late, go to bed. Come to my dorm tomorrow evening though. I\u2019ll give you some tips.\u201d\n\n\nAshido\u2019s eyes light up like he\u2019s placed Christmas incarnate in front of her. He leaves before she can get the idea to hug him.\n\n\n***\n\n\nThe next evening Ashido turns up like clockwork. The first thing Aizawa does is ask her about her study routine as it is now. The second she starts explaining, he wonders if he would be allowed to sneak vodka in this one time. He then shakes the thought away. No, if he starts now, he\u2019ll never stop. Not with his class.\n\n\nInstead, he pulls her up and helps her build a timetable. They allot a specific study time for each day and a rough guide on how long to spend on each subject. Next, Aizawa asks a few questions to determine what kind of learner Ashido is - visual, it would seem - and so passes some tips along. He shows her how to highlight effectively, how to designate what needs revision, more studying, and a lot more studying via post-it notes, and helps her make some flashcards for a couple of subjects. He quizzes her on them a few times until her answers come above a failing grade and then she beams.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Aizawa, you\u2019re a genius!\u201d she screeches.\n\n\nHe isn\u2019t and she hugs him and Aizawa vows he\u2019s never helping another student ever again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nAizawa doesn\u2019t mean to overhear but he does. He\u2019s slipping on his shoes to leave for the weekend when he catches the tail end of his students\u2019 conversations. Midoriya is going to Toshinori\u2019s for the weekend, all excitement and giddiness. Bakugou has been dragged into going to Kaminari\u2019s with Kirishima and Ashido. Iida and Sero are visiting their families while Ojiro\u2019s and Hagakure\u2019s are having dinner together.\n\n\nMost of it goes over his head but what doesn\u2019t go over his head is the conversation Shouji and Tokoyami are having a little way away from the group. It sounds like a discussion they\u2019ve had before.\n\n\n\u201c-should just go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be time to go when summer break comes around.\u201d\n\n\nTokoyami frowns at the answer, folding his arms. \u201cYour mother is frequently unwell and you haven\u2019t seen her since enrolling. Who says UA won\u2019t put on another summer camp?\u201d\n\n\nHe isn\u2019t wrong, Aizawa thinks sourly. They are having another training camp. Aizawa is also going out of his way to ensure not one single villain comes anywhere near his class.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see her soon,\u201d Shouji says in a tone that very firmly says to drop the matter.\n\n\nAizawa takes that as his chance to leave the room, only this time he backtracks and heads to his office on the second floor. He pulls up the student files to see exactly where Shouji\u2019s mother lives and why he can\u2019t go home on the weekend like every other student. He\u2019s either being difficult or\u2026 \n\n\nOr is apparently the answer as Shouji comes from Fukuoka, all the way in Kyushu. He\u2019s almost as far south as they come and the train alone would take near twelve hours one way. It isn\u2019t cheap either. To make it in a weekend is nigh impossible.\n\n\nStill\u2026\n\n\nSighing, Aizawa sets about making some calls. He meets little resistance and is soon contacting the staff office. He gets the okay and then prints the emails that have come through. He bundles them up and heads downstairs. His class are all sitting around the dinner table now and if Aizawa can get behind any of 2-A\u2019s antics it\u2019s this; communal meals eaten every night all together. Midoriya spots him first and starts looking for an available chair and jesus, this kid.\n\n\nAizawa waves him off, going to Shouji instead and slapping the papers down in front of him. The student isn\u2019t surprised by any means, just raises a curious eyebrow. Aizawa ignores him in favour of addressing the rest of the class.\n\n\n\u201cPrincipal Nezu has given you Monday off in light of your two night field lessons this week. Enjoy your long weekend,\u201d he tacks on blandly.\n\n\nAshido is the first to react, jumping up and goddamn squealing. The rest follow suit then, whispering amongst themselves excitedly. Aizawa sees Shouji staring at him dumbly, shocked by what\u2019s in his hands.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cThat plane leaves in two hours.\u201d\n\n\nShouji is up and running then, making a few others cry out in confusion but when they ask Aizawa what that was all about, he simply shrugs. After all, it\u2019s not like he bought the tickets. And if he gave Shouji\u2019s parents a nudge, it was only because they deserved it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOoh, ohh, I want a caramel one!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoa man, really? Um...oh, honeycomb! That\u2019s crunchy, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, a cotton cheesecake would be wonderful, if it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUm...no, I-...Can it-...All Might colours?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question has almost become commonplace around the dorm: what kind of cake do you want for your birthday? Satou had strategically written everyone\u2019s birthday on the kitchen calendar as soon as they\u2019d moved into the dorms and he\u2019d made good use of it. He tracks everyone down and asks them a week or so out so he had time to plan and prep. Satou had somehow even found his birthday and Aizawa had had to resort to threatening him with detention to make him stop.\n\n\nAnd then voila, on his birthday, his favourite dessert had appeared. He\u2019d scowled at one particular student and they\u2019d just smirked back.\n\n\nWhich was probably why he notices when a birthday comes up on the calendar and no one has been asked yet. It has Aizawa approaching despite his sheer lack of interest and wondering who is the one being left out. The answer is somehow worse.\n\n\nSatou\n\n\nOf course. The kid who bakes for everyone else will miss out on a cake because...well, no one else makes cakes. Maybe they don\u2019t even know how. (A lie, Bakugou knows how, but Aizawa doubts he makes a habit of checking the calendar.) It probably doesn\u2019t even occur to 2-A that Satou will be missing out. They just take the cakes for granted now and have seemingly forgotten that someone has to actually make them. And that that someone will perhaps like one too. Or at least, one they haven\u2019t made themselves.\n\n\nAizawa glances at the time: 9:53 P.M. \n\n\nThe kids will be in lights out in seven minutes so if nothing has been prepared yet, nothing is going to be prepared.\n\n\nAizawa groans. Great, just great. His pride is going to die if he has to ask Nemuri. As much of a disaster as she is, she can bake. His fingers are hovering over her contact when he\u2019s saved in the form a squeaking coming from the stairwell.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya guiltily creeps into the room, tv guide clasped tightly in his hands. A special on All Might has been circled several times in red and is set to start at 10. Aizawa then remembers something.\n\n\n\u201cDo me deal problem child; you watch your show, I get your mother\u2019s number.\u201d\n\n\nReally, Aizawa already has it on file but he\u2019s too lazy to go upstairs and fetch it. Midoriya nervously asks why but under his gaze quickly rattles it off, thanking him before scurrying to the couch, tucking himself into his All Might blanket and turning the television on. His eyes are already wide with wonder.\n\n\nAizawa shakes his head ruefully before making the call. \u201cSorry to bother you at such a late hour Mrs. Midoriya, but there\u2019s a favour I\u2019d like to ask.\u201d\n\n\n***\n\n\nThe next morning everyone comes downstairs to find a beautiful sponge cake covered in smooth, white icing and lined with strawberries on the table. \u2018Happy Birthday Satou\u2019 is piped across the top in Midoriya Inko\u2019s neat handwriting, though no one seems to recognise it due to their shock and horror, and also relief. They\u2019d forgotten but someone, luckily, has remembered. One glance Midoriya\u2019s way has him very quickly denying that he knows anything, loudly saying that they should get Satou instead.\n\n\nAnd then Satou comes in. His face upon seeing the cake almost makes it worth it. Almost.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re doing practical hand-to-hand that day - as in, combat without their quirks - and Aizawa is watching his class lazily. They\u2019re second years now and can handle themselves. At this point, if Aizawa has to step in, that student can expect detention; they know better. He watches Todoroki dodge a kick from Uraraka, while Bakugou and Kaminari are brawling further across the room. Ojiro flips Jirou onto her back and then Midoriya, having been watching out of the corner of his knee, attempts to copy the move. \n\n\nAizawa sees the moment it all goes wrong. Midoriya\u2019s grip isn\u2019t right and luckily, luckily, Kirishima is fast enough to harden himself before Midoriya damn near snaps his neck.\n\n\nOf course, Midoriya is already apologising at a hundred miles an hour as Aizawa approaches, Kirishima shaking his head and laughing up at him. Ojiro and Jirou have stopped their match and also approached, seeing as how they\u2019re closest. \n\n\nMidoriya flushes under Aizawa\u2019s gaze. \u201cSorry,\u201d he manages.\n\n\nAizawa raises an eyebrow. \u201cAm I who you really should be saying sorry to?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya goes impossibly redder before bowing to Kirishima. Kirishima awkwardly waves him off but Aizawa takes the moment to bring everyone else over. Midoriya squeaks in shame but Aizawa ignores him; he has no intention of calling the boy out. Instead he says,\n\n\n\u201cYour hand-to-hand skills are all improving but each of you have an area where you\u2019re lacking. From now, you\u2019ll work one-on-one with a tutor.\u201d Aizawa waves Ojiro over, who blinks at him owlishly.\n\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour top of this class, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nOjiro looks uncertain, which of course gives Bakugou the chance to jump in. He snarls that he\u2019s better and Aizawa cuts his argument off by throwing the two of them into the ring together. He gives Ojiro a look. \u201cTalk the class through what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, okay\u2026\u201d Ojiro says, raising his fists and beckoning Bakugou to come.\n\n\nThe match lasts seconds.\n\n\nBakugou is on his back before he knows it, Ojiro explaining the placement of his hands and how he used his opponent\u2019s momentum. He goes again, the result not the same but similar. They go back and forth, Bakugou never being able to gain ground. He\u2019s strong and he has technique but Ojiro is professional. Aizawa can see the class\u2019 respect growing with each time Bakugou hits the mat. Midoriya is hastily muttering away and Aizawa\u2019s sure he\u2019s itching for his notebook right about now.\n\n\nAizawa calls time after the twelth time Bakugou is dumped, sending them on their way.\n\n\n\u201cAh, sorry about that,\u201d Ojiro says, offering out a hand only to have it knocked away.\n\n\nBakugou goes to snap, Aizawa can see it, but then their eyes meet. It takes a moment but then, \u201c...you\u2019re good, it pisses me off.\u201d\n\n\nOjiro\u2019s eyes widen. He offers his hand again, only it\u2019s taken this time. Bakugou goes to storm away when Ojiro hastily calls after him, \u201cHey, do you want me to teach you that flip?\u201d\n\n\nBakugou pauses. \u201cThe one where you buckled my knee?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\n\nOjiro hesitates before beaming. He teaches the manoeuvre to Bakugou and it isn\u2019t really any surprise when Midoriya is asking for a turn next, always keen to learn. Ojiro, Aizawa finds, is a good instructor. He handles each classmate differently and can calculate their skill level from a few exchanged blows. He\u2019ll have to keep an eye on that.\n\n\n***\n\n\nIt turns out he doesn\u2019t need to, Ojiro coming to him after class two weeks later and asking permission to use one of the school\u2019s gyms every Thursday for hand-to-hand lessons. Aizawa signs the form as nonchalantly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s used to having students that come from far and wide. UA\u2019s reputation is well known, not just in Japan but worldwide. It\u2019s only natural, what with All Might having attended and all. The number one hero cannot attend a school without the media getting wind of it; plus, Toshinori had never kept it a secret. He was proud of his heritage. \n\n\nBut, Aizawa thinks dryly to himself one day, France is too far.\n\n\nOn a good day he can handle Aoyama and his flamboyance. On bad days, like today, he simply wants to send the student out the window. That, apparently, is frowned upon and Aizawa isn\u2019t willing to risk losing his job over it. He knows from overheard conversations and the student\u2019s own transcripts that Aoyama did one year of middle school in Japan before getting into UA. It does mean though, that most of his friends live in France and that his entire childhood was spent there. It\u2019s a big change.\n\n\nToday though...today Aoyama is sobbing dramatically at his laptop, clearly skyping some of his friends. They\u2019re all speaking rapid fire French and Aizawa still grapples with English sometimes, let alone French. \n\n\nHe passes Midoriya as he reaches for his coffee mug, the smaller student politely moving out of his way. He winces as Aoyama borderline shrieks something. \u201cYou too huh kid?\u201d Aizawa drawls.\n\n\nMidoriya jumps at being caught, hands flailing. \u201cNo, I-...I, of course it\u2019s harder! I mean...I can go home whenever I want and I-...I grew up here so\u2026\u201d His hands drop only to twist together, a habit Aizawa thought he\u2019d gotten him out of.\n\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d he chastises, tapping Midoriya\u2019s hands. The student quickly shoves them into his pocket. \u201cAnd what is it Aoyama misses?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya hesitates, like he thinks this might be a trick, before answering. \u201cI know he\u2019s mentioned his friends but I think\u2026\u201d Midoriya shrugs. \u201cAoyama says he misses the food a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Aizawa says, waving him off when he jitters. With Midoriya gone, it\u2019s just Aizawa left in the kitchen, Aoyama\u2019s voice wafting in from the common room. With a sigh, Aizawa takes his coffee to his room and opens his laptop. Looks like he has some research to do.\n\n\n***\n\n\nA few days later a delivery arrives. It\u2019s addressed to Aoyama but he loudly proclaims he never asked for it, that he doesn\u2019t even know what is inside. The class crowd around him as he opens up, a few disappointed when all they see inside is pastries but Aoyama waxes poetic about their beauty. He then tries one and sudden he goes from waxing to sobbing. That earns him a few startled cries but Aizawa just rolls his eyes.\n\n\nIt hadn\u2019t been so hard, finding a patisserie run by actual French people using traditional French recipes.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just fancy bread in the end, really.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re having a melee style battle. It\u2019s mostly for fun, which is unheard of at UA, but the other option was to let to the students have their fun on Sunday at one of the school\u2019s training fields and Aizawa does not need to spend his weekend minding these hell children. So he cuts a class or two with the other teachers\u2019 permission and they let the kids have a game of last man standing. For 2-A and 2-B it\u2019s compulsory but anyone from the second year has been invited to join. Quite a few students from other departments have turned up, to unleash their quirks if nothing else. There has to be near a hundred students scrapping on the field.\n\n\nAizawa raises an eyebrow when he sees Jirou be not the first student out, or even the first few, but certainly lower than he would have expected. A quick glance shows him the rest of the class is still in and that makes him frown.\n\n\nBut off to the side Jirou is giving her head the odd shake and massaging her ears as if they\u2019re ringing. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if they were; the whole field is alight with the sounds of quirks and yelling. Bakugou is, unfortunately, both. There\u2019s Yaoyorozu making canons, Bakugou firing off explosions, Kirishima smashing through Todoroki\u2019s ice walls to crash into Tetsutetsu, the roar of Iida\u2019s engines. And that\u2019s just his class.\n\n\nSeeing Jirou look his way, Aizawa beckons her over with a wave of his hand. \u201cYes Mr. Aizawa?\u201d she asks.\n\n\nHe gestures at the field. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you still be out there?\u201d\n\n\nJirou\u2019s eyes immediately find the ground. \u201cAh, probably\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019s scratching her neck sheepishly but that\u2019s when Aizawa sees it; the blood coming from her ears. He remembers reading the report of something similar when Jirou had gone up against Hizashi in last year\u2019s end of term practical exams. He\u2019d assumed at the time it was because of Mic\u2019s quirk and maybe it was but he now thinks it might have had something to do with Jirou\u2019s too. He pulls her up when she makes to leave, eyeing off the other students still \u201cfighting\u201d. \n\n\n\u201cYour quirk gives you a general hearing enhancement, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\nJirou pauses and then nods.\n\n\nAizawa hums in thought. \u201cI take it the sheer volume of noise is too much right now.\u201d\n\n\nHis student flushes but doesn\u2019t back down. \u201cI\u2019m still learning,\u201d is what she says, and she says it firmly and without room for questioning. \u201cAs a hero, I won\u2019t be able to pick and choose my situations. I have to learn to deal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Aizawa says, leaning back and folding his arms, eyes on Midoriya as he launches into the air and swings a kick around. \u201cOr perhaps, like Kaminari and other classmates, you could talk to the support department.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s Jirou\u2019s turn to frown. \u201cI can\u2019t cancel out of the noise; hearing is part of my quirk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes Bakugou come across as deaf to you?\u201d he asks bluntly.\n\n\nJirou looks taken aback. \u201cNo\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nAizawa makes a \u201cthere you go\u201d gesture. \u201cThen go and see the support department. He has; to protect his ears from the sounds of his explosions. You\u2019d be surprised what the support department can do these days.\u201d\n\n\nHe moves off then as Satou limps off the field but it doesn\u2019t escape his knowledge that Jirou pays particular attention to Bakugou for the rest of the exercise. He isn\u2019t surprised a week later either when Jirou turns up to their hero practical lesson with a modified costume - specifically some new, sleek earmuff looking devices. Aizawa doesn\u2019t grin as he leaves the monitors. He doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe front door opens and Aizawa frowns, eyes flicking to the clock on the microwave. Too early for Hizashi and school isn\u2019t on break which means it won\u2019t be Todoroki. That leaves only one person.\n\n\n\u201cWho let you off school grounds?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d is the single syllable answer.\n\n\nAizawa sends his eyes skyward because of course it was. He hears footsteps down the hall and then the loud flump of a body hitting the sofa. There\u2019s then some jingling of bells and cooing and ah, the cats have arrived.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making tea. You in?\u201d\n\n\nHe gets a grunt of affirmation, which has Aizawa frowning. There\u2019s unsociable and then there\u2019s this. He\u2019s at the couch in seconds, peering over the back. He\u2019s met with stiff shoulders and a clenched jaw. Aizawa doesn\u2019t even need to think before leaning over and massaging a shoulder gently. It gets him a deep sigh that almost sounds like it hurts. His frown deepens.\n\n\n\u201cMigraine?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHeadache.\u201d\n\n\nThat isn\u2019t much better because that\u2019s where they always start. Still, Aizawa takes the kettle off the boil and pours two cups, making one both decaffeinated and green. He shuffles back to the sofa, sets the cups on the coffee table, and then lifts the offending head up long enough so he can sit down.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been using your quirk too much again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the heroics department now. I don\u2019t get a choice.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa grimaces because it\u2019s true. His hands toy with rough hair softly. His nephew-cum-son tilts his head enough to scowl at him, Aizawa just rolling his eyes. \u201cSleep.\u201d\n\n\nThat earns him a sly grin. \u201cSorry Dad, that\u2019s my quirk, not yours.\u201d\n\n\nMaybe not, but Aizawa has something better.\n\n\n\u201cHitoshi.\u201d\n\n\nHis son immediately backs down, flopping into his lap and closing his eyes. No, he may not have a brain washing quirk but he thinks being a father works just as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\n\n"
