    "text": "\u00a0\n\n  Silent Shadow  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSirens wail in the distance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nColdness seeps into his veins, vision blurring with each passing moment. Has the sky always been so blue? He feels wetness on his cheeks.\n\u00a0\nHuh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s warm. He reaches out to touch the source, fingers meeting something soft.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe knows he\u2019s an idiot, that all this could have been prevented if he had just done what All Might told him. However, for some reason, he\u2019s not upset like he normally would have been. He\u2019s content to have actually done something. For once in his life, he got to save someone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s so much commotion now. He hears someone yelling. Rough fingers shake his shirt. Bright hair brushes against his fingertips. He grasps onto it. He knows this hair.\n\u00a0\nHe smoothes it down, giving the wearer a soft smile.\n\u00a0\nThe name rests upon his lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlowing green eyes stare at the ceiling. His digits scratch at the area near the IV port. The fluids burn as they absorb into his skin. They used to be worse, he thinks, not that he can recall when or how. Still, there are the echoes of pain that linger, reminding him that there are greater things than death. Though he doesn\u2019t understand how there could be.\n\u00a0\nHis first memory begins in the room. He doesn\u2019t remember how he arrived or how long he has been in the room, only that he started existing there one day. At least that is what the Doctor says.\n\u00a0\nThe Doctor says a lot of things. He is rather talkative, so much so he makes enough conversation for both of them. He cannot recall their first words to each other, only vague impressions of not so pleasant feelings. He\u2019s not sure how long it\u2019s been since he came into existence, but at some point the Doctor gives him the name Kuro because he is the ninth one and that makes him special, even if he can\u2019t talk. Kuro writes on his little board, asking what happened to the other eight. The answer he receives makes him sad. He would have liked to have known the others. The room is lonely when the Doctor isn\u2019t around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t like the name all that much. But he doesn\u2019t argue with the Doctor for another.\n\u00a0\nHis gaze flickers from the ceiling to the walls. The room is small, with one bed and a small bathroom to relieve himself. Kuro occupies the time by drawing on his board. It's hard at first, because he doesn\u2019t really know how to draw, only the action, but he gets better. He tries to make himself the first time around. It doesn\u2019t really work out.\u00a0 The image comes out all splotchy with how much black marker he uses. He learns to use significantly less as he goes. He likes using reds and yellows more. The colors make him feel secure. He knows those colors best.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSometimes he writes too, about the Doctor, about his strange body. He once dropped a pen on his leg and it ended up on the other side of the room somehow. He\u2019s not sure how he did that, only that it\u2019s part of his Quirk. Though he cannot physically vocalize, his lips can form shapes around the word: Quirk. A small bubble of giddiness runs through his body at the mere thought. His fingers ache to write, to analyze the Quirk he has. What sorts of uses are there? How does he activate it? He erases the words as he goes along, not wanting anyone to see. Why doesn\u2019t he want others to see? He\u2019s not sure. . .\n\u00a0\nHe misses talking to the doctor. He wonders what is beyond the white door.\n\u00a0\nHe wonders about a lot of things. There is nothing else to do in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro is surprised when he is taken from the room. The Doctor wants him to meet someone important. Their benefactor. He calls him \u201cSensei\u201c. Kuro remembers the definition of the word but lacks any visuals to back it up, like most things these days. Not that it matters. He finds out soon enough.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSensei\u2019s room is different from Kuro\u2019s. There are monitors in this one, stretching from wall to wall. Below them, the light of several different machines illuminates the room\u2019s single resident.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEverything in him is screaming at him to run away. The room\u2019s owner emanates power, even if he doesn\u2019t have a face. The skin from the top of his head down to his mouth is covered in scars. Kuro\u2019s stomach churns. The older male is big, much bigger than him or the doctor. Even though he is sitting in a chair, he makes Kuro\u2019s senses go haywire.\n\u00a0\nThis man is dangerous.\n\u00a0\nHis presence sucks up all the warm air in the room. Kuro tries not to flinch when the man grabs his chin, a slice of white teeth forming an imitation of a smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what do they call you little one?\u201d He continues to hold onto the boy\u2019s jaw. Kuro stays still, fearful of incurring the man\u2019s wraith. In spite of Sensei\u2019s demeanor, he can sense a more sinister nature beneath.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have given him the designation Kuro, on account that he is the ninth in the series,\u201d the Doctor answers for him. \u201cAmongst other reasons. . .\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man\u2019s grin widens. \u201cA little on the nose, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-I thought it would fit, given the experiment\u2019s subject matter.\u201d He lowers his head. \u201cI apologize if it is not to your liking.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI never said that, Doctor. It\u2019s cute. You did well,\u201d he says to the Doctor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Doctor twists at the ends of his mustache. \u201cAh, well, for the most part, yes\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nSensei\u2019s fingers tighten around Kuro\u2019s jaw. He dare not look up. \u201cFor the most part? What is wrong?\u201d He releases a small chuckle. Kuro shivers. He wants to run, but his legs do not obey him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you failed?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe doctor trembles, hands clenched together. Kuro can feel the man\u2019s fear. It strengthens his own.\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-oh, no, of course not. The experiment is a success. A wonderful success,\u201d he rubs his hands together. \u201cWe just have a few minor problems to work out,\u201d he explains.\n\u00a0\nSensei\u2019s hand encroaches upon Kuro\u2019s neck. The boy swallows. He would like to go back to the room now, please.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFiddling with his glasses, the doctor replies shakily, \u201cNothing major. He is merely unable to speak. His vocal cords are there and he can make small sounds, but . . . I suspect the broca area was damaged sometime prior to or during retrieval of the subject. Otherwise, he\u2019s perfectly fine! All mental faculties are in working order as you requested. He still understands orders and can communicate via writing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man holding Kuro\u2019s neck relaxes. The tension drains from the room. \u201cGood enough. We\u2019ll put him in training immediately then. You may return to your station. I have no further need for you right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, of course, sir. Whatever you say,\u201d the doctor remarks, sending one last look at Kuro before shuffling away.\n\u00a0\nKuro goes to follow the doctor, but Sensei\u2019s grip keeps him from taking another step. Sensei is not finished with him yet.\n\u00a0\nHe never did return back to his room after that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to find out why. The air in the room shifts not long after Sensei makes a call. Slowly, the area in front of them distorts as a black vortex takes form. His eyes narrow as a figure takes shape, stepping out of the darkness with seamless grace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro isn\u2019t sure what to make of the man standing in front of Sensei. His clothes are clean and proper, with dark slacks and a fitted vest that oddly suits him. That isn\u2019t what interests the boy though. His eyes travel upwards, widening in surprise at the startling sight. The figure has wispy black smoke where his head should be. Kuro looks down at his own similar form, not sure how to feel.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou called for me.\u201d The man bows at the waist, eyes never straying from Sensei. \u201cAnd I am here to serve. How may I be of assistance?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Kurogiri,\u201d Sensei praises, voice akin to a friendly grandfather. \u201cI am quite pleased with your treatment of my protege.\u201d Fingers snake around Kuro\u2019s neck. \u201cSo much so that I have a new assignment for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere is a shuffling of feet. It takes Kuro a moment to realize it is Sensei\u2019s. Though he is hooked up to a ventilator, he moves well enough, the hand around Kuro\u2019s neck switching to his back. He follows the guiding hand, too afraid to do anything else.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is Kuro-chan,\u201d he introduces to the other. He taps on Kuro\u2019s back. The boy tenses before bowing, his movements much clumsier than the other man\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nA moment of silence passes before Kurogiri remarks, \u201cIs he\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe shadowy man nods, eyes flickering down to Kuro\u2019s. They are cold and analytical, taking in his appearance. Kuro\u2019s hands fidget. He isn\u2019t used to this much attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKuro, this is Kurogiri, one of my finest employees. Obey him as you would obey me. Understood?\u201d Sensei asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe nods. The words resonate with something in his mind, a cold spot that he tries to ignore most of the time. It grasps onto the words, burying them deep into the boy\u2019s psyche.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSensei must always be obeyed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next few weeks go as well as one would expect.\n\u00a0\nKurogiri isn\u2019t sure what to make of the boy. He trusts Sensei but this . . . it unsettles him to see something so similar to himself. He knows, logically, that the child is cut from the same cloth, custom-made to serve their Master as he saw fit. He just hadn't thought the man would choose to make another version of him. Though his colors run closer to green than to purple, they more than resemble each other, abilities, and all.\n\u00a0\nNonetheless, his master has faith in him to instruct the boy. Kurogiri knows he cannot fail him now. The League has not recovered from their last battle with All Might. Another warper could help push the balance in their favor.\n\u00a0\nThey clean out the storage closet not long after the boy\u2019s arrival. It\u2019s small but it fits a bed and dresser well enough. He does wish his master had brought some clothes for the teen, but they would make do with Shigaraki's old clothes. Until the child's uniform came in.\n\u00a0\nYet, as with most things, these changes do not come without consequences. To the surprise of no one, Shigaraki destroys one of the bar tables at the announcement of their newest recruit. The boy never did like to share things. Sadly, despite Kurogiri\u2019s protests, the older boy treats the younger as he does the rest of the Nomu, ordering him around for no other reason than to amuse himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Kurogiri makes do with what he has for this new mission. The boy takes to work well enough, cleaning floors and tables as instructed. Working inside the bar itself is another story. He isn\u2019t sure which is the worst these days: his wine bottles being in constant danger due to Kuro\u2019s accidental portaling or Shigaraki\u2019s anger issues. Truly, his Master has given him a herculean task.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhich is why he must remain on constant vigilance. Thus, as he has several nights this week, Kurogiri once again finds his student stuck in the ceiling, legs wiggling in vain to dislodge himself. Kurogiri sighs. With a hard pull, he extracts the boy from the vortex. It closes with a soft pop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe child lands on his back, releasing a soft hiss. His eyes widen at Kurogiri\u2019s form. Hastily, he reaches for his little board, scribbling a quick apology.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said that yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that,\u201d he drowns. Kami, he needs a drink.\n\u00a0\nAt least the boy has the decency to look embarrassed. He bows his head. Kurogiri shakes his own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using your powers outside of training,\u201d he chides as he lifts the boy up by the armpits. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro\u2019s eyes lower. Slowly, he writes out, \u201cI want to get better.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf it was any other quirk, he might have encouraged the boy's tenacity to train, but warping was not nearly as simple. Warping requires detailed knowledge of not only one's surroundings, but also understanding exact coordinates of where the other side of the portal could end up. Otherwise, they have accidents.\n\u00a0\nHe mourns the past, present, and future wine bottles this child shall destroy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis hands rest on the boy\u2019s shoulders to keep his attention. He does not get paid enough to handle one problem child, let alone two. Shigaraki is at least predictable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you will,\u201d Kurogiri promises. \u201cBut you cannot keep warping into the bar. You\u2019ve already destroyed our wine rack.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do I do then?\u201d He emphasizes the question with two lines beneath.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor starters, you can clean up the mess you\u2019ve made,\u201d he says, swinging his work towel over his shoulder as he gestures to the fallen glass. \u201cAfter that, we can work on the basics once more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA soft howl of wind travels through the air. The young warper slowly rocks back and forth, mindful of how close he was too the edge. Kuro doesn\u2019t normally like heights, but this particular rooftop feels surprisingly safe. He found it not long into his arrival, trying to escape Shigaraki during one of his tantrums. It\u2019s one of the few places he feels safe in this world. The open space is so different from the world he was born into.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro shifts his focus inward. Even though he is no longer in the room, he still dreams about it. He dreams about a lot of things. The lick of flames against his skin, the taste of blood, a screaming boy with eyes as red as his favorite marker. No words, no explanations.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t know what they mean, but they\u2019re important. Sacred. He has a feeling that revealing these dreams could lead to more questions from Sensei, so he keeps them secret. While he much prefers his life here versus the room, it is not without its hardships.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tries to think of the positives. Shigaraki is no longer actively trying to kill him as he did when Kuro first arrived, but the resentment lingers like an open wound. He knows he has disrupted the other boy\u2019s routine. He is like Sensei in a way: Kuro never knows how the older boy is going to react.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpeaking of, the young warper\u2019s contact with their leader is minimal at best. Kurogiri does most of the reporting regarding his progress with his Quirk. Going by the sounds the other makes, it is not up to Sensei\u2019s standards, but he doesn\u2019t take it out on Kuro at least. He feels bad for his teacher though. Kurogiri hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. The boy releases a soft sigh. It\u2019s his own fault.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not as if he is blind to his uselessness. The shame clings deeply to his being. He barely knows how to use his Quirk yet. He and his teacher\u2019s power sets are similar, almost identical really, though Kuro\u2019s is not nearly as powerful or stable. Even moving from one side of the room to another takes a lot out of him, and keeping the connection open\u2013well, easier said than done.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKurogiri says to picture it like a telephone line, connecting one call to the other. So far there\u2019s a sensation of tugging when one opens a line.\u00a0 But how does one stabilize the connection? And for that matter, how does one keep more than one portal open at the same time?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe drums his fingers across his writing board. Does it have something to do with him? Who was he before the room? The Doctor says he was born there, but he\u2019s already a teenager. At least, he thinks he is. He feels like one.\n\u00a0\nHis gaze flickers downward. The blanket of night highlights the strange smoky tendrils that rise from his body. When he closes his eyes, he imagines the arms as solid and pale, dotted with freckles where the sun last kissed them. When he opens his eyes . . . well, it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t notice the stares people give him when he does errands for Kurogiri. The worst looks are from the children, scared and uncertain by his strange appearance. He can\u2019t blame them. Even he is unnerved by what he sees in the mirror, no face or discernible features other than his eyes. It stuns him sometimes, the person in his reflection. He knows, intellectually, that it is him but there is some animalistic gnawing in the back of his head, yelling that something isn\u2019t right. He has tried to feel out his face once before, but his hands are unable to feel anything of detail. It is as though there was an invisible barrier.\n\u00a0\nHe leans back against the roof. What exactly is he? Why does he look so much like his teacher? These questions and more swirled around in his mind. He almost doesn\u2019t notice the soft nudge to his shoulder. He freezes up before realizing who it was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d The older warper inquires. Kuro suspects the look on his face is one of polite judgment. If Kuro squints, he can see the bar on the other side of the warp gate. Carefully, the man climbs onto the tiled surface, wood creaking beneath his weight. \u201cAnd why are you not in bed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he writes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are not the only one,\u201d Kurogiri remarks dryly, pressing a small cup into the boy\u2019s hands. \u201cBut children should not stay up so late. You are a growing boy. Drink this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDrugs?\u201d He inquires, adding a small emoji with a lifted brow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKurogiri chuckles, eyes crinkling. \u201cYes, the strongest drug of all: chocolate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis writing board is already ready to ask, \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe older man blinks. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro scratches the back of his neck with one hand while the other writes down his thoughts. \u201cYou treat me nicely. Shigaraki and the others don\u2019t. They think I\u2019m useless,\u201d he writes.\n\u00a0\nHis shoulders tighten. He must step lightly here lest he get sent back to the room. It hasn\u2019t happened yet but the threat is there, an ever-lingering constant in the back of his mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are learning. Sensei entrusted your guardianship and education to me for a reason,\u201d Kurogiri explains in a matter-of-fact tone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what happens if I don\u2019t learn?\u201d He asks, letters blurring together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe has seen what happens to the other Nomu who fail. His heart thumps wildly as the first one who failed to do as Shigaraki asked came to mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro frantically scribbles another reply. \u201cBut what if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t just clean bar tops for the rest of his life. Is he defective? What if the Doctor was wrong and he really is a failure? He doesn\u2019t like being weak. It reminds him too much of\u2013\n\u00a0\nA warm hand brushes his shoulder. He looks up, surprised to see how close the man is. \u201cDrink your chocolate and calm yourself. Your hands are shaking.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe obeys. Kurogiri\u2019s words ring through his mind. The sweet drink hits his taste buds, enveloping him like a nice cozy sweater. Slowly, his hands relax, followed by the rest of his body.\n\u00a0\nHis eyes drift upwards to the other. Despite his polite, if cold, demeanor, there is a soft side to the older warper. Kurogiri is a unique figure in the League. He doesn\u2019t bully Kuro around like Shigaraki and the others do and he doesn\u2019t terrify him like Sensei does either, another plus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sleepy now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe shakes his head but his body betrays him, a small yawn slipping out. Quirk training has taken a lot out of him, both mentally and physically. His head bobs, the heat of the chocolate flowing through his body in waves. It\u2019s nice to be cared for. Kuro could almost say it\u2019s familiar somehow, though he hasn\u2019t the faintest idea as to why.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you a story to pass the time then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, he nods. Stories are fun.\n\u00a0\nKuro listens to his mentor\u2019s words, the deep voice carrying into the night as he regals an oddly familiar tale; The dawn of quirks and one lone man who started a very entrepreneurial business of sharing said quirks. He isn\u2019t sure when he falls asleep on the roof, but he is glad to be back in his bed the next morning.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComic Commission by the lovely FruitloopChan.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo matter the hours, weeks, and months that pass by, the training continues. The last rays of sunlight filter through the blinds, reminding the teen how long they had been practicing. Mirroring his mentor\u2019s movements, Kuro takes a breath, shoulders relaxing as he puts himself in the proper headspace. His arms ache in protest as he raises them once more. It has taken him months to do this. He can\u2019t mess up. Not now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheoretically, it should be simple. He is made for this sort of thing. The Doctor said so. Mentally grasping at the image, he stretches out his senses. Sucking in air as the world around him darkens. The energy is cold and violent but it is tame under Kuro\u2019s hands, pliant to his control. Just as the tug begins in his chest a vortex grows before him, a reflection of his teacher\u2019s. Once it is big enough both males step through their own, ending up on opposite ends of the room.\n\u00a0\nKuro releases the energy a moment later, falling to his knees. It\u2019s a good thing he doesn\u2019t sweat, otherwise, he would be drenched.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA soft whack to his head breaks him out of his thoughts. Kurogiri\u2019s disapproval almost hurts as much as his body does. \u201cYour next break isn\u2019t for another hour. What are you doing on the floor?\u201d\n\u00a0\nToo exhausted to write out his answer, he releases a long dry whine to emphasize his current status. Much to his surprise, the sound soon transforms into a short yelp when his teacher lifts him up by his armpits, body dangling in midair.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe looks up questioningly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to learn to stay up on your feet,\u201d Kurogiri states, setting him back on the ground once more. \u201cNo matter how tired you are. They will take advantage if you show weakness.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe tilts his head to the side, waiting for an explanation as to who they are. Kurogiri seems to catch on to the boy\u2019s body language (a phenomenon that grew more and more with each passing day), the next words out his mouth are, \u201cHeroes. The Pro-Heroes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro doesn\u2019t notice the disdain, focusing on the symbolism behind the word instead.\n\u00a0\nHis eyes perk up. It rings a bell in his mind. Heroes like the ones on television? He hasn\u2019t seen one in person yet, though he very much wants to. A delightful warmth develops in his core. What he has seen excites him for some bizarre reason. Perhaps it was due to all their interesting Quirks? Kuro did so like Quirks. He likes everything about them really. It was one of the things he and the Doctor bonded over prior to his arrival here.\n\u00a0\nKurogiri must have noticed his expression, going by the increased glow to his molten gold eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cToss whatever thoughts you have about them aside, child. Their true nature is government dogs whose only wish is to stamp us out,\u201d Kurogiri says venomously, a surprising amount of emotion from the normally composed man. \u201cThey will not hesitate to kill us, that is why you must strike first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if,\u201d Kuro starts, writing the rest of the sentence below. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWrong question, he realizes too late.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe air takes on a thick taste of wrongness, setting his instincts on edge. One of the hanging lights starts to swing, shadows flickering back and forth below it, a clear warning of what will come. Kuro\u2019s throat tightens. Fear pulses within him as he takes in his teacher\u2019s expression, reminding him that while the man may be kind to him, he is also not to be disobeyed.\n\u00a0\nSensei\u2019s words echo through his mind.\n\u00a0\n\nObey him as you would obey me.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nKuro bows low. A distinct shiver runs through his body when he hears the echo of the other\u2019s footsteps, growing louder with each step until they are right below Kuro\u2019s line of vision. He gulps.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do not have a choice in the matter. You will do as you\u2019re told or else you will be disposed of,\u201d his teacher states, voice devoid of emotion. \u201cDo you understand, little shadow?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro shivers but nods. The room seems to lighten at his response, the tension clearing between them. He lifts up, back ramrod straight as he waits for his teacher\u2019s next act.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe is thankful his teacher does not hold his words against him, moving onto the next topic seamlessly. \u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page. You\u2019ve made good improvements on your gate creation and coordination.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis eyes lighten at the compliment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich means you are ready to start combat training. Shigaraki has been antsy lately.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro resists the urge to cry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA sudden rush of pain jolts throughout Kuro\u2019s body. The flip leaves him breathless but it is the sucker-punch that does him in, making the teen lose his lunch moments later.\n\u00a0\nHe hates this. Fears this. Training with Kurogiri is so much nicer. At least he doesn\u2019t try to actively kill Kuro. Aren\u2019t they all on the same side?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDisgusting,\u201d his attacker grumbles, adjusting the hand on his face. \u201cHe\u2019s too weak. He\u2019s practically Quirkless.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro coughs as he gets up from the floor. His side is killing him, but he can\u2019t quit just yet. Shigaraki\u2019s words light a fire inside him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot weak,\u201d Kurogiri answers from across the room. \u201cUntrained. You were like him not so long ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to this creature,\u201d Shigaraki hisses, throwing another fist in the boy\u2019s direction. Kuro narrowly dodges the punch, rolling several feet away. His side throbs, reminding him of the damage he took.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKuro is not a creature. He is Sensei\u2019s subordinate, as are you,\u201d the older warper reminds.\n\u00a0\nA fast kick drops Kuro to his knees. He groans.\n\u00a0\nEveryone here is so much stronger and faster\u2013better than him. How can he ever hope to reach their level? He tries to rise again but his left leg gives out, causing him to fall back to his knees. Not that it matters. Shigaraki has already started walking away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d the older boy says, scratching at the side of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShigaraki, wait\u2013\u201d Kurogiri\u2019s words fall flat as the door slams behind him.\n\u00a0\nThe room is silent apart from Kuro\u2019s gagging. A rush of shame finds him as his stomach empties itself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wants to sleep forever. Though he cannot see it, he is fairly certain his body is covered in bruises. His everything hurts. Is that even possible? Soft footsteps draw his attention upwards. A firm hand rubs circles into his back, the other handing him one of the bar towels. He takes the item, using it to wipe down Kuro\u2019s mess.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrembling fingers draw out his writing materials. Though the writing is less than neat, the words are legible enough to make out. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d his teacher remarks. \u201cShigaraki merely wants to prove himself to Sensei.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro\u2019s pen moves as the other talks, having an answer right as the man finishes his sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s right though. I\u2019m weak.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs I said, you are not weak, merely untrained,\u201d Kurogiri states plainly. \"Everyone has to start somewhere.\"\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy does he hate me such much?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis teacher flexes his fingers, picking up the soiled towel and tossing it into an awaiting portal. \u201cIt has nothing to do with you specifically.\u201d He releases a deep sigh before adding, \u201cI do wish he would take preparations seriously.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis perks Kuro\u2019s interest. \u201cPreparations? What are we preparing for?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomething tickles the area above his head. It takes him a moment to realize it is Kurogiri\u2019s hand. \u201cNothing you need to worry about right now. Focus on bettering your Quirk.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy takes his words to heart, though he cannot help but feel curious as to what he spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are only a few things in life that interest Shigaraki. Video games hold a special place in his heart, the variety of genres and consoles giving him great pleasure. Especially ones where he can demolish his enemies for ultra-rare weapons and armors. The screams of the weak also bring him great joy; the frightened brat in front of him is one of them. He wonders how many different sounds he can extract from the little warper, but fate has other plans. Seconds after he disintegrates the little Nomu\u2019s left shoe he\u2019s back in the portal. Another fluke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are, Kuro-chan,\u201d he mocks, twisting around. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s been able to let loose. Sensei can always make another, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe room is quiet. Too quiet. As loathe as he is to admit it, Kurogiri\u2019s baby clone has learned from their first encounter. His warping is getting better.\n\u00a0\nBut not good enough, he thinks, as he catches the boy in the corner of his eye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDried lips split into a wild grin. He reaches out\u2013\n\u00a0\nAnd grasps air. Damn it! NPCs aren\u2019t supposed to be this elusive. Shigaraki is practically a high-level character at this point. It should not be this hard for him to grab a level 1 newb.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot fair!\u201d He yells in frustration, stamping his foot. This is becoming less like a hunt and more of a game of hide and seek. Why did his Sensei even see the need of making another warper? Kurogiri was enough.\n\u00a0\nToo many damn NPCs in his life. It doesn\u2019t help that this brat keeps stealing his old shoes. While they no longer fit him, the theft remains one of several points of contention between the two. Something about Kuro just set him off. Maybe it was his innocent way of viewing the world, or perhaps it was his obsession with the fakes who called themselves heroes\u2013it scratched at the inner parts of Shigaraki\u2019s soul in a way he detested.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why, when the warper tries to dip by again, he is already there to greet him, four fingers latching onto the tail end of a shirt. He jerks it back, dragging the little warper out of the sanctuary of his gate and onto the cold hard ground.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe relishes the look of fear in the other boy\u2019s eyes. They\u2019re much more expressive than Kurogiri\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you think you could escape?\u201d He states, one hand balled into a fist.\n\u00a0\nKuro blocks his first punch but not the second, groaning when it hits his diaphragm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo last words? Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Should I get you a pen instead?\u201d He mocks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDumb little Nomu. The Doctor must be losing his touch if he can\u2019t even make a good knock-off of Kurogiri. He hears the sound before he feels it against his face, a warm wetness. His index goes to touch it, not believing what he sees.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you. . . did you just spit at me?\u201d Shigaraki asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe swears the little bastard is grinning behind that foggy ass face of his. He rubs it off, noting the reddish color. His lips stretch into a sinister smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, so you can bleed.\u201d He pulls back his arm, all five fingers at the ready. The Nomu\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe brings it down\u2013\n\u00a0\nAnd his fingers meet concrete, the warper disappearing back into the mist once more. The material crumbles beneath his touch as he roars. This is a pain in the ass of the highest level. How the hell did he not see the emerging portal? Absolute fucking cheat code right there. And how dare the newbie make him look like a fool?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShigaraki flexes his fingers. Looks like this won\u2019t be their last fight after all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConvenience stores would be the death of him. He instantly recognizes the look on the cashier\u2019s face. It is one he has faced several times before. His gaze immediately travels to the door. Can he make a run for it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a son,\u201d the cashier gushes, the wrinkles around her eyes crinkling. \u201cHow sweet. He looks just like you!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe first time it happened, Kurogiri was swift to correct the mistake. The second time occurred like the first, as did the third, and the fourth, and . . . he stopped around the twentieth. It doesn\u2019t help that the Doctor named the boy after him, despite his protests. Did he think it was a joke? It\u2019s not as if he could explain why either. He doubts Sensei would be happy about him spreading information regarding Nomu creation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuch a bother. People didn\u2019t annoy him when it was merely him and Shigaraki. The older boy makes most people unnerved. But alas, Shigaraki isn\u2019t here now to buffer the comments and Kurogiri is too polite to say otherwise.\n\u00a0\nKuro lifts his head at the mention, cocking it to the side. The white scarf around his neck hides most of his face from view, giving him an almost comical resemblance to onigiri. It would be cute if the wearer wasn\u2019t hiding something.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOh dear. That\u2019s a good question. He remembers the Doctor saying that the child was young, but he never got an exact age. Based on his physical growth charts, he estimated that he is somewhere in his early to mid-teens. Kurogiri makes sure to keep his head straight, lest he miss the boy\u2019s quick fingers as he lies, \u201cFifteen. He\u2019ll be starting high school in the Spring.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYes, fifteen seems appropriate.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe woman makes a cheerful sound in response before continuing on with the conversation, much to Kurogiri\u2019s consternation. As expected, Kuro takes that time to act. His hand disappears into the air just below the counter. A bold move. Moments later, the hand pulls back, prize in hand. He tries to sneak the item onto the countertop of groceries, but Kurogiri swiftly intercepts the action, though not without catching the eye of the clerk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat have I told you about unhealthy foods?\u201d Kurogiri mumbles beneath his breath.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take words to know the boy is flustered. His hands move about erratically. If anything, the clerk seems even more gushy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHungry, dearie?\u201d She laughs, picking up the first item in line to scan. \u201cOh, my son loves Katsudon too. I swear, growing boys eat anything and everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa, ha . . . Indeed,\u201d he replies, wishing he could be anywhere else right now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKurogiri inwardly groans. He is only here to pick up groceries. It doesn\u2019t help that Kuro is pushing the food forward, giving the older warper the ghostly equivalent to puppy-dog eyes.\n\u00a0\nA stronger man would refuse. Any other day, a fully caffeinated Kurogiri would do the same. But he is not either of those men today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe woman rings up the food swiftly after his humiliating defeat. He wonders if he should kill the woman but decides against it. Too many witnesses.\n\u00a0\nThe winter air hits them as they walk out. Both males shiver. The Doctor clearly didn\u2019t perfect the homeostasis issue in the second generation either. Perhaps it cannot be solved due to their cold-blooded nature? He zips up his coat, stepping onto the frost-covered pathway. As always, Kuro follows a few steps behind.\n\u00a0\nRight before he can open a portal he feels something tug at sleeve. He looks down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d says the boy\u2019s board. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about something for a while.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou may always ask me things, child.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you my dad?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKurogiri stops functioning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no of course not,\u201d he answers. \u201cHow on earth did you arrive at that conclusion?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe is thankful he is not drinking anything at the moment, though he very much would care for a good, strong gin and tonic right now. Where did . . . the convenience store. The other times people mistook them for family. It is a conversation that was bound to happen sooner or later, he realizes grimly. Not soon enough apparently.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are not genetically related. You were made from my blueprints. Your Quirks are copies of mine,\u201d he explains, gesturing between them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro scribbles another question, tucking the board underneath his chin as he shows it to him. \u201cSo . . . I\u2019m your clone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. We are not exactly alike, are we?\u201d He brushes a hand through the mist above the boy\u2019s head to emphasize. The green and purple wisps repel against each other like oil and water.\u00a0 \u201cOur base parts are different.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho was my base then?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am not privy to that sort of knowledge,\u201d Kurogiri answers truthfully. Master and the Doctor receive Nomu components from various places: morgues, hospitals, battle scenes, the occasional dumpster. He does not ask where. It is above his station.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s your base then?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI . . .\u201d He changes the subject, not wishing to dive into that particular past. He is Kurogiri now. Nothing more. \u201cThat is not important. We were made to serve Sensei. That is all you need to care about. Come. We have more errands to run.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe opens the vortex, hoping that this is the last time he has to deal with parentage questions regarding his young charge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShigaraki groans. Of all the NPCs he has to be stuck with today, it\u2019s the kid again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe claws at his neck, trying to keep from falling prey to his instincts. Stupid brat, stupid game, stupid Kurogiri leaving him to babysit. He should be outside, getting rid of more of those stupid Pro-Heroes, not stuck in his room with a midget of a Nomu.\n\u00a0\nJust his luck too, as his screen blacks out after the twelfth time he\u2019s challenged the level\u2019s boss. \u201cGame Over\u201d flashes across, taunting him with his failure. On instinct he throws the game across the room towards the eyesore. The Nomu's eyes widen, but he catches it before it hits the wall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBring it,\u201d he commands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis babysitter\u2019s miniature does the opposite, pulling out his stupid board again. Ugh! Typical. Stupid NPC can\u2019t even follow easy directions. He flops back down on his bed, legs kicked up against the wall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhy is he the one who has to stay? Hasn\u2019t he proven himself to be a field leader yet? How aggravating. His fingers inch up to the corner where his neck and head intersect, pulling at the day-old scab there. It\u2019s not fair.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA shadow obscures his vision. He rolls over to snap at the brat, but the words fail to leave his mouth as he looks over at the boy\u2019s writing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you playing? Is it fun? Can I play?\u201d He jots down more words. \u201cCan I help you somehow?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSeveral thoughts pass through Shigaraki\u2019s mind: One, the Nomu was actually more sentient than the other trash, even if his writing was utter crap; Two, the Nomu is interested in video games, which makes him a step up from the rest of the League\u2019s NPCs; And three, as loathe as he is to admit it, he really needs a Player 2 to play cannon fodder to the ridiculously OP boss who made him throw the game in the first place.\n\u00a0\nIt is a win-win scenario when it comes down to it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust don\u2019t die or I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he grumbles, handing over the second controller.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is at the first sign of Spring that Kuro realizes how much time has passed. How many months has he been here now? Over a year, he thinks, or maybe a little less than that. He\u2019s grown a few inches since his arrival, filled out a little in some places as he put on muscle from training. Not much, but he\u2019s getting there. It\u2019s a nice change. He likes it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd he\u2019s even gotten better with his Quirk! Sensei seems pleased at least. He\u2019s not nearly on his teacher\u2019s level yet, but he can at least move himself and items up to a certain size through the warps. And he doesn\u2019t get stuck in them nearly as much! Another plus!\n\u00a0\nIf only the sparring sessions with Shigaraki were as productive. Sadly, at best all he can do is evade the older boy, though he has gotten a few hits in as well. Not enough however, going by their win-loss ratio.\n\u00a0\nBut at least he\u2019s not some Quirkless Deku anymore. He\u2019s . . .\n\u00a0\nWait. He pauses mid-sweep. Where did that thought come from?\n\u00a0\nThe doorbell chimes, breaking Kuro\u2019s confused thoughts. At first, he thinks it\u2019s an actual customer, a rarity given their real profession, but that notion soon corrects itself when he sees the face, or rather, the hand on the face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, was Kuro-chan expecting someone else?\u201d Shigaraki leers, taking the boy\u2019s broom and disintegrating it as he heads toward the bar.\n\u00a0\nThe teen can\u2019t help but stare at the remains of his broom. This is the third time this month! Shigaraki might not have to clean the bar but Kuro did and destroying his cleaning supplies was not helping. A wave of frustration flows through him. He discretely flips both middle fingers at the man\u2019s back, right in the view of Kurogiri. The older warper shakes his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet me a glass of the strongest thing you have,\u201d Shigaraki orders.\n\u00a0\nKuro writes down a recommendation on his writing pad that draws a snort from Kurogiri and a glare from Shigaraki.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCute, knock-off. Real cute,\u201d he mumbles, taking the drink Kurogiri prepares him and taking a deep sip. In one fluid movement he drops a newspaper onto the bar. Kuro has to strain his neck to see it.\n\u00a0\nHis eyes widen in excitement as he recognizes the person on the front page.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you see this joke?\u201d Shigaraki states while laying his drink over the newspaper. \u201cIt says he\u2019s a teacher now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro tenses up at the simmering anger beneath the other\u2019s tone. It\u2019s no secret that no one else in their group likes All Might like Kuro does.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow can he not though? The man deserves admiration. His powers are immense. Kuro swallows up whatever information he can find on the hero, taking notes on his abilities along with the rest of the Heroes. What he would give to have a powerful Quirk like that. Not that he dislikes his Quirk or anything!\n\u00a0\nYet . . . he would never admit it to Kurogiri but using his powers never feels exactly right. Maybe it\u2019s because Kuro isn\u2019t the real thing?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, what do you think will happen when the mighty Symbol of Peace is finally killed by the villains?\u201d Shigaraki suddenly asks out of the blue.\n\u00a0\nKuro freezes. That\u2019s . . . is that what they\u2019ve been preparing for? His stomach twists at the thought. But All Might is the top Pro-Hero.\n\u00a0\nIt leaves him feeling out of sorts. He knows his place here. He\u2019s a weapon, a tool for Sensei and the League. He hasn\u2019t been around to see the killings but he\u2019s there to clean up the aftermath. This is his life.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think about that, Kuro-chan? Nothing to say? Oh, that\u2019s right, you\u2019re a mute,\u201d Shigaraki says in a cutting tone, lifting his glass at the boy.\n\u00a0\nKuro resists the urge to throw the remains of his broom at the older boy\u2019s head. Instead, he focuses on wiping down the bar stools, viciously attacking the imaginary dust there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop antagonizing him. Focus your energy elsewhere, Shigaraki. We have more important matters afoot,\u201d Kurogiri scolds.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou let him get away with everything, even though he\u2019s a goddamn hero sympathizer,\u201d Shigaraki accuses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tries not to react. Uh oh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLies and slander,\u201d Kuro writes across his board, hoping his handwriting doesn\u2019t betray his nervousness.\n\u00a0\nRed eyes scan his form before a dirty smirk emerges on Shigaraki\u2019s face. Slowly, agonizingly so, he pulls out a very familiar book. \u201cOh really? What is this then?\u201d He slams it onto the table, his alcohol spilling across the newspaper. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on us, brat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis notebook. Kuro\u2019s fingers twitch. How did Shigaraki get a hold of it? A flare of anger took hold. He went into Kuro\u2019s room! He went through Kuro\u2019s stuff! Oh, if looks could kill . . . Kurogiri\u2019s eyes narrow. Kuro watches in dismay as the man starts going through the pages. Kuro scrambles to provide an excuse. \u201cI just like to take notes. It\u2019s not only Heroes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Kurogiri snorts, showing one particular page with their resident hand specialist on it. While Kuro is no professional artist, he likes to think he gets some resemblance right, though he may have exaggerated on this one.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShigaraki\u2019s brows cross, mouth pulling into an irritated scowl. \u201cIs this supposed to be me? I do not look like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKurogiri closes the book but does not give it back to either of them. Instead, he remarks in a pleased tone, \u201cThese are quite detailed. Sensei will need to know of this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro wants to die. His heart clammers inside his chest, threatening to break out and run for the hills. These are his personal writings! It feels weird enough that Kurogiri seems interested in them. What on earth could Sensei want with his analyses?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe communicates this on paper. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShigaraki and Kurogiri give him conflicting answers. The former huffs, dissatisfied he can\u2019t get Kuro in trouble while the later sighs, sticking the book underneath his arm lest Shigaraki get a hold of it again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d his teacher begins, \u201cI believe this could prove useful to our endeavor. I\u2019ll alert Sensei of your findings, Shigaraki. Perhaps young Kuro may be of use this week.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe look of horror on Shigaraki\u2019s face would be priceless if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Kuro was being roped into something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Shigaraki sputters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe can tell Kurogiri is pleased by the reaction. Suddenly, Kuro wonders if the biggest sadist in the room isn\u2019t their resident handyman. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time both of you did some fieldwork.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe breathes, in and out, trying to calm his terrified nerves. The other members make him weary. He\u2019s not used to being around so many people. The bar is completely full, past legal capacity even. Not that anyone here cares about legality. Nothing about what they\u2019re going to do is legal.\n\u00a0\nInvading the Unforeseen Simulation Joint gives Kuro a lot of misgivings. They would be going right into Hero territory. Even if they would only be dealing with students and a few teachers, they were still heroes in training. Sure, they have numbers, but numbers didn\u2019t matter when the Heroes have All Might. The man is practically an army himself. If he even shows up. Sure, he might be teaching class then but who knows what could happen. Shigaraki brushes off his thoughts the moment they are written. He can\u2019t fathom losing, Kuro thinks. He\u2019s so wrapped up in thinking of this as a game.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not.\n\u00a0\nKuro pulls at his shirt sleeve. He isn\u2019t used to the newness yet. His mentor says the outfit is a gift from Sensei. They are much nicer than his normal work uniform. The pants and vest are nicely fitted. How Sensei knows his exact measurement, he\u2019s not sure. It doesn\u2019t matter, he supposes. The shoes actually fit him too, not like the hand me downs from Shigaraki\u2019s closet. They\u2019re a pair of nice red high tops that match the tie, completing the outfit. Now, if only he could get it on straight.\n\u00a0\nFamiliar dark hands take on the job for him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong,\u201d Kurogiri remarks. \u201cAllow me to fix it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro\u2019s fingers curl around the new phone in his pocket. He\u2019s used them before but this is his now. It is a nice change from the writing board.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKurogiri\u2019s hands settle on his shoulders. He leans down to eye-level. \u201cYou look tense. Is something wrong?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNervous,\u201d he types. \u201cScared.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man gives a firm squeeze to his shoulders. \u201cGood. Use that as fuel. Heroes will not take mercy on ones like us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis thumbs type quickly. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did Sensei tell you to do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cObserve,\u201d he types out. There isn\u2019t much else to say. Their Master was pleased by his notetaking skills, so much so that he assigned Kuro to the invading squad. Lucky him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen observe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does that entail though? Do I take notes on the battle? Or does he want me to account for the students? Maybe both? Do I need to help out with the others? What do\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nA large hand covers the screen. The artificial light is completely blocked by the black mists.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking this.\u201d He places a hand on Kuro\u2019s back, rubbing familiar rhythmic circles. \u201cTake a deep breath.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy does as he\u2019s instructed. Kurogiri must be obeyed. His shoulders loosen. The tension is still there but it\u2019s no longer leaking out like before.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro nods.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood. Keep hidden and take as many notes as you can. Do not engage the heroes or students unless absolutely necessary,\u201d his teacher instructs, pulling away. Kuro follows after, joining him at the front.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what happens if I do engage them?\u201d He texts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKurogiri throws him a long stare, eyes narrowing. \u201cYou know as well as I do what you have to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis throat grows dry. He\u2019s probably the only one in the group right now that hasn\u2019t killed someone. He really hopes it doesn\u2019t come to that today. Or any day, really. Does that make him defective?\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre the preparations done?\u201d Shigaraki asks. He is tense, scratching at both sides of his face. The skin around his jaw looks raw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are ready when you are,\u201d Kurogiri states, back straightening. The molten gold of his eyes makes Kuro shiver. He looks almost pleased to be heading into what could very well be their demise. Or the massacre of pro-heroes and children alike.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro wonders if he should take a shot of Kurogiri\u2019s special whiskey. Maybe he has enough time to fake illness?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d A monstrous grin spreads across Shigaraki\u2019s cracked lips, manic eyes darting \u201cI\u2019m done waiting.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s decided. Kuro\u2019s arms fall to his sides. Sensei must be obeyed, his mind instructs, over and over again until his body loosens, nervous thoughts drifting away. Black mist spreads out from Kurogiri, surrounding the group. There is no running away from this. Kuro must obey.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven if he doesn\u2019t want to.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt goes as well as Kuro expects it to.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBadly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might may not be there but Eraserhead certainly is (he immediately pulls out his notebook to start analyzing the man\u2019s Quirk) but Kurogiri warps him out of the man\u2019s path before he can write down a single word, transporting Kuro into an unknown area within the facility.\n\u00a0\nThe buildings are the only complete things and even they look less than sturdy. Everything else is worn and crumbled, artificially decayed to match the bleak atmosphere. Kuro gulps as he wanders the grounds. He\u2019s not used to being alone like this. Sure, he was left alone in his room back at their base, but this is completely alien territory. The crunch of gravel beneath his feet is louder than he expects it to be. His pace slows.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShould he return to Kurogiri\u2019s side? No, the man sent him here for a reason. If he truly needed Kuro\u2019s help he would have already warped him back. That is, if he knew the boy\u2019s location . . .\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRight, focus on the mission. Things aren\u2019t over yet. Noticing commotion in the west, he warps closer, choosing a small ledge on a nearby building to avoid detection.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir group is attacking a student it seems. And, to Kuro\u2019s surprise, he\u2019s actually holding his own. The spiky red hair makes him pop out against the dreary scenery.\n\u00a0\nAs Shigaraki would say, the redhead is an absolute tank. Kuro starts jotting down what sorts of Quirks the boy may possibly have. Strength-enhancer? Muscle-builder? There\u2019s a rock-like appearance to his skin. He taps the pencil against the sheet. He\u2019s not sending the people flying, so it\u2019s not an offensive or reactive Quirk. Defensive then. Maybe some sort of self-strengthening of the skin?\n\u00a0\nThe fight inevitably travels inside the building and going by the sounds he is hearing, it is not going in their favor. Not that Kuro truly minds. He\u2019s more interested in the boy\u2019s Quirk.\n\u00a0\nUntil an even more interesting power arrives.\n\u00a0\nThe building shakes at the arrival of a new opponent. Kuro\u2019s interest peaks. All the nervousness and fear is replaced with pure unadulterated adrenaline. Judging the distance, he warps closer, arriving on the floor above the two children. The scent of gunpowder and sweat permeates the air.\n\u00a0\nKuro peers over one of the holes in the ground. He\u2019s so close now. Dangerously close. And yet he wants more. There\u2019s something screaming in the back of his mind that he has to see this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe newcomer roars and Kuro stumbles back at the intensity of it. Emotions flood his body. Anger, fear, excitement, regret, sadness . . . it\u2019s all too familiar, though he doesn\u2019t know why.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe returns to spying on the two, enthralled by the fight before him. It\u2019s messy and uncoordinated but there is talent there. Raw talent. The blond\u2019s blasts are strong, knocking out every fighter he comes across. And he\u2019s only a first-year student. A strange mix of admiration and jealousy form in his gut.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFire-based, he thinks as the boy knocks back a particularly large man with one hand. Explosion-related? It\u2019s as flashy as Endeavor\u2019s Quirk, that\u2019s for sure. There are so many things Kuro wants to ask. How does he create the explosions? How many can he make? Is there a limit?\n\u00a0\nHis lips move soundlessly. He desperately wishes he could talk, now more than ever. Sounds develop in the back of his throat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro is so busy analyzing that he almost doesn\u2019t notice the thinning ranks. Soon, they knock out the final few. A little worse for the wear but otherwise unharmed. Amazing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that all of them?\u201d The blond says. \u201cSo fucking weak.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter a quick heel-turn, the redhead asks, \u201cEverything all clear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe other rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think, idiot?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright!\u201d He pumps his fist, either ignoring the blond\u2019s comment or not paying attention to it, Kuro isn\u2019t sure. \u201cLet\u2019s go save the others. If we\u2019re here then everyone else should be in the USJ too.\u201d The red one balls a fist. \u201cI\u2019m super worried. What\u2019s gonna happen to our guys with less offensive abilities? Shit, we really screwed up. We slowed Thirteen down when we ran off ahead. Damn it. As men, we have to take responsibility and help the others.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you want to go, then go.\u201d The blond remarks, voice getting lower. \u201cI\u2019m going after that warp gate bastard.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe red one\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s so childish, bro.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not your bro, Shark Week,\u201d he growls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut that guy\u2019s attacks are\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up!\u201d He faces the redhead, obscuring Kuro\u2019s view. He leans closer. In the corner of his eye, he notices someone moving. A member with an invisibility quirk? Kuro feels the urge to warn them but his teacher\u2019s orders are firm. \u201cThat misty-ass dickwad is the enemy\u2019s way in and out. I\u2019m gonna cut off their getaway route when the time comes. We stop him, and the others can\u2019t escape.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you should watch out for yourself brat!\u201d Screams the invisible attacker. \u201cStop the chit-chat and\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t even get time to finish his sentence. The blond captures him by the head with one hand, firing out a burst of fire and smoke a second later. \u201cIf this is all they have then the others will be fine. Trust in your classmates, idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, Bakugo. Nice save . . .\u201d The other boy states in wonder. \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly calm and rational.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro blinks. The name rings against the confines of his mind. He knows this name. There is something else the blond goes by, a soft voice in the back of his head reminds. What was it again?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBakugo lifts an annoyed brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, normally you\u2019re either like, super depressed or super angry, you know?\u201d Shark Week (Is that his hero name? Kuro isn\u2019t certain) answers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m always calm and rational you spiky-haired bastard!\u201d Bakugo growled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro giggles.\n\u00a0\nBoth heroes freeze. Instantly, Kuro covers his mouth. But the damage is done. They know someone is here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIdiot, he inwardly berates himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d One of the two voices asks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro doesn\u2019t take another minute to spare. He\u2019s already forming a gate with his free hand. His feet take a step back. If he can just\u2013\n\u00a0\nPiercing red eyes emerge from the hole he was spying from. A feral smile and smoking hands are all the warning Kuro gets before the ground explodes. Dust obscures his vision. He looks behind. His gate is almost done. Just a few more seconds.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHeavy footfalls tear his attention back to the boy. \u201cI see you, Warp Bastard. Think you can run from me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis warp wavers. Shit! The floor shakes as the other boy runs at him. Kuro pulls back, trying his best to evade the explosive teen. On instinct, he dodges Bakugo\u2019s right hook, rolling away from the scene and back onto his feet.\n\u00a0\nRumble falls from the ceiling. Kuro looks around frantically. All the commotion destabilized the structure. It\u2019s about to collapse!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet back here!\u201d Bakugo makes a rush for him, murder in his gaze. Kuro can\u2019t think. His heart clamors in his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe ceiling begins to fall. Thick cement pieces rain down. Kuro can only watch as it catches the blond by surprise. He blasts the first piece but the remains knock him down to the ground.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWatch out, Bakugo!\u201d His compatriot tries to make the distance.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s no time.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a slight tremor in his hand. This is too familiar. An unknown memory bleeds into his vision. Imaginary fire licks at his skin. A monstrous creature has a young boy in a stranglehold. Their eyes meet.\n\u00a0\nKuro . . . remembers this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis hand extends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMemories pound against the back of his skull as he summons the gate. It\u2019s smooth, smoother than anytime before. His hand changes, forming into mist as it surrounds the other boy. Kuro pulls. They fall through the blackness.\n\u00a0\nThe void of the warp is a stranger to sound and light. All he can feel is the arm he grabbed. His heart races inside his chest. What is he doing? It\u2019s his first time warping two people together. They don\u2019t get very far.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoments later, USJ\u2019s artificial lighting blares down on them. Kuro blinks, mind hazy. They\u2019re out of the building but still in the Ruins Zone. Kuro feels a wave of relief wash over him. He\u2019s alive. They\u2019re alive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven though you\u2019re Quirkless, you\u2019re still pretending to be a hero, Deku?\u201c\n\u00a0\nThe voice again. It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue. He doesn\u2019t have long to dwell on it. There\u2019s a rush of wind and he\u2019s being lifted up by rough hands. The taste of gunpowder lingers on his tongue.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me why I shouldn\u2019t just kill you right here and now, warp bitch,\u201d Bakugo snarls. He pushes Kuro against one of the still-standing structures.\n\u00a0\n\nFucking Deku. Damn it. You\u2019re not allowed to die you Quirkless loser. Fuck, there\u2019s so much blood. Why is there so much blood? Stupid idiot. Why didn\u2019t you just stay away? Why did you have to play the hero?\n\n\u00a0\nThe words come to him amidst the memories. He has to say it. Though his tongue is unused to forming words, he croaks out, \u201cKahhh . . .\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis voice is raspy, alien to his mind. But it\u2019s his. He pushes forward.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBakugo\u2019s brows cross in mild confusion. \u201cDid you shrink or something? Wait, you were behind that guy in the fight. You Warp Bastard\u2019s Bastard?\u201d He shakes the boy, forcing Kuro to gasp as more memories sank in.\n\u00a0\n\nYou said you wanted to be a hero, right? You can\u2019t leave now. Please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHis childhood friend. His bully. The images merge with the boy in front of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKa. . . cchan,\u201d he rasps, the first words he has spoken in over a year.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s strange to see Kacchan so shocked. The anger falls from his features as something more vulnerable takes form. The body language becomes less hostile as the seconds grow longer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe says it again, this time more confidently. \u201cKacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe can speak. The name reins free on his tongue. He remembers this name and this boy. Where once mere fragments existed is now becoming whole. It terrifies and excites Kuro. He has a past. He\u2019s more than just a shadow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe other boy makes a sound with his voice that Kuro can only identify as pained. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not . . . \u201c There is a break in his voice. \u201cD-Deku? Is that you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Kuro says, realizing it is now the only word he can say. Is Deku his name? No, that\u2019s a nickname, a childish taunt. It fits better than Kuro though. Even with the bad feelings associated with it, he feels attachment.\n\u00a0\nKacchan grabs his arms, scanning over the boy. He squeezes, once, twice, as if he\u2019s not certain what he sees is real. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. What happened? Why do you look like this? What\u2019s\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nMist rises from the ground. It is not his own. Kuro\u2019s hands tremble. There\u2019s so much he wants to tell Kacchan. But the words cannot reach his lips. His eyes scan the horizon as a bitter realization dawns.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKuro isn\u2019t Deku. Not anymore. Because. . .\n\u00a0\nBecause he died. The Sludge Villain. The Fire. The memories play across his mind\u2019s eye. He didn\u2019t just lose the fight, he lost his life. And . . .The Doctor made him new. And now he\u2019s indebted to them. Forever.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d he whispers mournfully.\n\u00a0\nKurogiri\u2019s form flickers into view.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe other boy doesn\u2019t notice his change in tone. \u201cWe have to tell your mom. She\u2019s been so broken without you. Dek\u2013Izuku, about what happened before, I can\u2019t, fuck how do I put this into words . . .\u201d He closes his eyes. Through clenched teeth, the words leave his lips, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I fucked up. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe can feel Kurogiri\u2019s eyes on him. Watching. Waiting. His expectations weigh heavily upon his heart.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re on different sides now. Kacchan belongs to the heroes. It suits him. Kuro is envious but happy for the other boy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTime to go,\u201d Kurogiri\u2019s voice echoes, startling both teens. \u201cReinforcements have arrived.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKuro rises to his feet. There is judgment in his teacher\u2019s steady gaze. Kuro looks away. Did he hear everything? This will not be forgotten. He tries to step forward towards his teacher, but a hand grasps his own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinks in surprise, looking down at his friend. \u201cKacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d Kacchan whispers. Kuro\u2019s heart aches at his old friend\u2019s broken expression. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe mist grows heavier. Kuro can hear his pulse inside his head. Everything is happening at once. The voices of Pro-Heroes travel through the vicinity. Those must be reinforcements. The redhead appears in the distance, leading those forces.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no guarantee help will come in time for Kacchan, Kuro thinks, so long as he holds onto Kuro\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\nColdness snakes around his body, the darkness extending its reach. Something wet drops from his face. He\u2019s surprised to find it\u2019s coming from him. This situation would almost be humorous if it weren\u2019t so sad. He remembers his dream again, his burning desire to help others rising like a tide over the blank spots of his mind.\n\u00a0\nHis name isn\u2019t Kuro. It isn\u2019t Deku either.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s Izuku Midoriya. And he knows what he has to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRough fingers clench his hand. The smell of gunpowder brushes against his senses.\n\u00a0\nIzuku lets go.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe mist overtakes the area he stands in. His friend is screaming his name again. He reaches out, but there\u2019s nothing there. His stunned face is the last thing Izuku sees before he returns to his teacher, returns to face the punishment he will receive for disobeying orders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku smiles.\n\u00a0\nThe name rests upon his lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Calladraws\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCheck out my discord for sequel updates, my other fics, concept art, fanart and more!
