    "text": "As an omega in the twenty-first century, Eddie likes sex, heat or no heat.\nIt's nice either way, but as an omega who pretty much physically resembles the textbook alpha, it\u2019s hard to find someone who\u2019s willing to stick their dick in him. Anne had been a great partner, but she\u2019s got Dan now, and as much as Eddie should hate the guy who stole his alpha, he doesn\u2019t. Dan\u2019s a decent dude and Eddie genuinely likes him.\nLong story short, Eddie\u2019s sex life has been virtually nonexistent since the fallout with Anne, so it doesn\u2019t occur to him that his new parasitic hitchhiker might make things problematic in that aspect of his pathetic life.\nIt doesn\u2019t change much, his life that is. Eddie wakes up, eats, heads out to chase down leads to his latest story, comes back (sometimes covered in dirt and blood), eats again and passes out (sometimes sans shower), wakes up and repeat. He learns to block out the constant drone of the symbiote\u2019s suggestion of eating everyone they pass in the streets with that mediation crap. Eddie\u2019s started wearing earbuds after the first week and people have stopped staring at him like he\u2019s a lunatic talking to himself.\nHe even gives Venom free rein over his Netflix account and laptop at night, provided that the symbiote gave him a full seven hours of uninterrupted sleep in return. It seems to be working fine, although Venom has recently started a disturbingly R-rated horror movie binge after finishing the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Eddie\u2019s just relieved the alien goo has stopped slobbering over him and hissing \u201cmy precious\u2026\u201d in his ear every morning Eddie brushes his teeth in front of the bathroom mirror.\nLife is strangely mundane, if Eddie\u2019s to be honest, so he doesn\u2019t really think too much of it when the missing children case he\u2019s pursuing leads him to a dingy bar after midnight and one of the good-looking alphas pauses long enough to give him a once-over that turns into something more explicit back at Eddie\u2019s place.\n\nEddie, I do not like him.\n\nHe ignores the symbiote\u2019s agitated\u00a0growl and strips out of his jeans, anticipation and arousal a happy cocktail swirling through his veins. It\u2019s been too long since Eddie\u2019s felt that tingling rush of euphoria after a good hard fuck.\n\nEddie...\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d He snaps at the alien and shoves the alpha onto his bed before climbing on top.\n\u201cNot you,\u201d Eddie tells him when the guy lifts a puzzled brow. He leans down and slots their mouths together. They fumble a condom on and Eddie guides the alpha\u2019s dick into that slick little opening at the base of his balls, a sigh of relief escaping his lips as the alpha bottoms out. It\u2019s a nice stretch. The man groans when Eddie tightens around him experimentally and grinds down.\nIt\u2019s not fun for long, because two thrusts in, the guy mutters something about him being too tight and Eddie looks down to see a tendril of black peeking out from where they\u2019re joined and about half a second later, Venom seeps out of him like a menstrual nightmare and bites the alpha\u2019s dick clean off.\nThere\u2019s an insane spray of arterial blood and screaming, which all come to a gruesome end when Venom decides it\u2019s had enough of the flailing and rears out of Eddie\u2019s body to swallow the man\u2019s head whole. His ears are still ringing when the symbiote slithers back inside, silence settling over them like a heavy blanket.\nYou should shower, Eddie. Venom prompts after a pause.\nHead still reeling, Eddie gets up from the blood-soaked sheets and mechanically makes his way into the tiny bathroom. Venom retreats into the back of his mind, settles like a fat, purring cat there, radiating smug contentment. Eddie watches the veins of pinkish blood slither down the drain along with the hot water that blurs his vision.\n\nHis cunt just bit a guy\u2019s dick off.\n\nIt\u2019s never done that before, the still functional part of Eddie\u2019s brain observes helpfully. Eddie realizes in hindsight that he probably shouldn\u2019t have let Venom watch all those stupid horror films, especially the one with the girl that had the monster vagina.\nTwenty minutes later, as his bloodied sheets are rotating gently in the washer, Eddie dials Anne\u2019s cellphone and admits that he may have a problem.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you taking your suppressants as prescribed?\u201d Dan asks the moment he gets Eddie\u2019s blood work results back from the lab. Anne\u2019s seated a few feet away, a worried frown on her beautiful face.\nEddie\u2019s so busy mentally restraining the symbiote from physically materializing and stroking the female alpha\u2019s hair that it takes Dan\u2019s question a few seconds longer than necessary to penetrate his distracted brain. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWell, your hormone levels are normal, which shouldn\u2019t be if you are taking suppressants,\u201d Dan explains, \u201calso, it shows you\u2019re due for a heat in about a week\u2019s time, Eddie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been taking the medication,\u201d Eddie splutters.\nDan looks thoughtful at that, \u201chmm, then my only guess at the moment is that your body is not processing the chemicals. Gradual immunity has been recorded in rare instances. We can switch to a more aggressive treatment to stem off the impending heat if that\u2019s what you prefer. But I have to warn you that there are drawbacks, which might include irreversible damage to your liver and kidneys. The research on that drug so far hasn\u2019t been conclusive.\u201d\nHe fidgets on the examination table, fingers twisting in his loose hoodie. Venom stays surprisingly silent in Eddie\u2019s head.\n\u201cAre there any other alternatives?\u201d Anne asks the question for him.\n\u201cYou could find an alpha to help with the heat,\u201d Dan suggests. Eddie shakes his head vigorously. He doesn\u2019t want to castrate any more bed partners, not while his penis-eating parasitic housemate is still hanging around. Anne sighs. She's the only person Eddie has told about the incident. Dan\u2019s gaze flickers briefly between them. Then, clearing his throat, the other omega walks over to a drawer and pulls out a blue rod-shaped thing encased in a plastic case. Eddie blinks, lips parting.\n\u201cWe also have pink,\u201d Dan says, dutifully pulling out a pink version of the knotting vibrator.\n\u201cBlue is fine,\u201d Eddie says weakly and buries his hot face in his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo add insult to injury, he has to go buy his own fucking batteries.\n\u00a0\nEddie wakes up Wednesday morning covered in congealed blood. The sheets are ruined yet again (how is he even surprised at this point?) and Eddie\u2019s shirt and boxers are beyond salvaging.\nWe were hungry, Venom mumbles guiltily when Eddie steps into the shower and turns the water on. Besides, it wasn\u2019t human.\n\u201cYou mean you were hungry,\u201d He snaps back, stuffing a toothbrush in his mouth to get rid of the disgusting coppery taste. \u201cWhat did you eat, Venom?\u201d\nHalf a dozen cows apparently.\nThe reporter on Eddie\u2019s old TV gestures enthusiastically at a glowering farmer and what Eddie assumes are the remaining survivors. They look traumatized, the cows that is. The farmer just looks pissed.\n\u201cHow did you even find cows in the middle of the night?\u201d He asks in the silence, hair still dripping cold water down his neck as he towels himself dry in the living room.\n\nGoogle Maps.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Eddie huffs, an almost hysterical laugh tearing itself from his throat. He ambles over to the kitchen area and grabs a few fresh eggs from the fridge for an omelet. Anne and Dan have been taking turns monitoring his health and there are still fresh groceries in his fridge from the little shopping trip two days ago.\nHe crosses out another day on his calendar. Only four more days until his first actual heat in years. His vibrator and batteries are safely stored in the bathroom drawer. Eddie grabs the head of onion on the counter and ignores Venom\u2019s moan of horror.\nToday, revenge is best served in the form of onions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he gets to work later that day, Eddie's boss assigns him the stupid cow murderer case, insisting that it is the work of extraterrestrials. Technically he\u2019s not wrong but Eddie still can\u2019t help asking why.\n\u201cYou piled the hooves in a corner? What is wrong with you?\u201d He hisses at Venom when he steps out of his boss\u2019s office and into the empty elevator.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe farmer, a 76-year-old former marine, squints at Eddie and tells him that Tony Stark did it. He also tells Eddie that he\u2019s thinking of pressing charges.\nApparently, Stark had flown over the area in the Iron Man suit last night.\nThat poor son of a bitch.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThursday, they eat six large pizzas for dinner and Eddie passes out in front of the TV to a documentary about sloths.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSaturday morning, Dan comes bearing fresh groceries. Eddie\u2019s still in bed when the other omega lets himself inside with the spare key.\n\u201cHey Eddie, you up yet? I heard the craziest story on the way here this morning,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice floats cheerfully in through the open bedroom door. Eddie stirs, sleepily stretching his limbs in the watery winter sun light. Dan continues, \u201cMrs. Chen, you know, the Chinese lady who owns that convenience store you always go to, well, something ate all her chickens last night. There was a huge mess.\u201d\n\nEddie, don\u2019t be mad...\n\nEddie sits up in bed and something brown and light flutters into his lap. Then, another piece. Followed by another. Feathers, in all sorts of colors, are strewn across his bed along with flecks of blood.\n\"She called the police and said it wasn\u2019t a wild animal because they ate everything but the feet. There was a pile of chicken feet in a corner\u2014\u201d Dan\u2019s words cut off abruptly as he rounds the hallway and sees Eddie sitting in his nightmare nest of chicken feathers.\n\u201cTell me that came from your duvet,\u201d Dan says in a strangely calm voice.\n\u201cMorning, Dan,\u201d Eddie clears his throat and admits, \u201cuh, I think I know where Mrs. Chen\u2019s chickens went.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou at least cooked them before you ate them right? I mean, this isn\u2019t a repeat of that restaurant incident again, correct? Remember, Eddie, where you sat down in one of their aquariums and ate half a lobster raw? Anne and I are banned for life from there thanks to you,\u201d Dan leans in and whispers at him. Eddie tries to smile reassuringly at him, but judging by the look of dawning horror on Dan\u2019s pale face, it\u2019s clearly not working. \u201cOh God, it is, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s still inside you. The fire from the rocket didn\u2019t kill the weird space parasite? Is it going to kill me? Is that why you brought us to Popeyes in the middle of the day?\u201d\n\u201cOk, Venom kind of wants to kill you, yes, but I convinced it not to, granted that you buy the symbiote all the fried chicken it wants,\u201d Eddie winces when Venom tugs harshly on his ribcage, \u201cfine, we want, all the fried chicken we want. Happy? God, you\u2019re such a dick, Venom.\u201d\n\nTakes one to know one, Eddie. Now, tell him to order us the pecan pie too.\n\n\u201cIt wants pecan pie too,\u201d Eddie sighs as he relays the order. He drums his fingers restlessly over the countertop while Dan obediently flags down their waitress and adds the item.\n\u201cDoes Anne know?\u201d The doctor asks when the woman departs. Eddie nods and allows Venom to take over his hands. The symbiote crams a piece of chicken tender into their mouth, spraying crumbs all over the table top as he chews. Dan starts mopping up the debris with a crinkly napkin he pulls from the dispenser like a proper little housewife. \u201cI knew there was something strange going on when you came back and all the dead tissue was gone. Wait, how does it not show up on your blood work?\u201d\n\nWe have our ways.\n\n\u201cThere are\u2026ways\u2026\u201d Eddie passes on the info.\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s actually pretty amazing. I mean, it\u2019s capable of creating the kind of cellular regeneration only seen in stem cells and reversing the damage to your organs. Who knows what else is happening inside of you, Eddie.\u201d\n\u201cWait, do you think it\u2019s possible Venom had something to do with why my heat suppressants have stopped working?\u201d Eddie asks. He\u2019s become increasingly suspicious over the past few days to be honest.\nDan blinks and admits honestly, \u201cyeah, very possible.\u201d\nEddie\u2019s left foot suddenly lashes out and delivers a hard kick to Dan\u2019s shin.\n\u201cOww, what the hell was that for, Eddie?\u201d Dan yells, flinching back.\n\u201cSorry, that wasn\u2019t me,\u201d He apologizes hurriedly and forces his body to stand. Venom is a buzzing mass in the back of Eddie\u2019s head, but he can barely hear it past the hot pounding of blood in his ears. \u201cI need to have a very angry conversation with the disgusting piece of garbage camping inside me. Thanks for the food, Dan.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what about your pecan pie?\u201d Dan calls after him, \u201cEddie?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are such a douchebag,\u201d Eddie wheezes.\nHe\u2019s spread-eagled on the floor in the kitchen, Dan\u2019s groceries strewn around him in bits and pieces. As it turns out, it is virtually impossible to have a proper fight with yourself. He does manage to slap Venom around once or twice with a giant shiny zucchini that Dan had gotten him.\nEddie hates zucchini.\n\nThe chemicals are bad for our babies, Eddie. We do not want them to die.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pregnant, Venom,\u201d He groans, throwing both hands over his eyes and pressing down hard in frustration. \u201cThose are just eggs that are inside my ovaries. Every omega has them. On Earth, you only get a baby when an egg meets sperm, ok? I don\u2019t want that to happen, which is why I\u2019m taking the pills in the first place.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like talking to a toddler, a creepy, slimy, eight-foot tall, massive beefcake of a toddler. Who has somehow retained a weird kind of innocence despite so much killing. It is oddly sweet.\nNo, it\u2019s got to be the hormones making him think that.\nVenom literally bit a guy\u2019s dick off during sex, Eddie reminds himself, shuddering at the memory.\nEddie\u2026 A strand of black alien matter materializes from Eddie\u2019s hip and strokes lovingly over his flat abdomen. What we did was normal. I saw on the Discovery Channel that preying mantis often eat their partners after sexual intercourse.\n\u201cI regret giving you access to the TV and internet,\u201d Eddie snorts, \u201cI\u2019m not a pregnant insect, Venom. Humans don\u2019t eat their partners after they have sex, freak.\u201d\n\nBut you could\u2026\n\n\u201cCould what?\u201d Eddie stares up at the crack in the ceiling. The black goo ghosts over his left nipple.\n\nGet pregnant.\n\n\u201cWell, technically yes,\u201d He mutters.\n\nHmm...\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get any weird ideas, dickhead,\u201d He swats at the appendage with an irritated hand. \u201cStop it.\u201d\nThey lay there in silence for a few minutes, listening to the muffled noise coming from all around them. Somewhere beneath Eddie\u2019s, an old jazz number is playing lazily on one of the lower floors.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the binge-eating recently?\u201d Eddie asks suddenly, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re the one pregnant, Venom. Are you eating for two symbiotes in there?\u201d\n\nI think the change in our body is affecting my appetite...\n\n\u201cChrist Almighty, me being super horny makes you hungry for raw flesh,\u201d Eddie groans and curls onto his side into a tiny ball, \u201cwhat a fucking pair we make, huh? You should\u2019ve bonded with a beta, Venom. It would've saved you a lot of trouble.\u201d\nI chose you, Eddie. You are mine, which means your little imperfections are also mine, Venom says. And the weird appendage is back, stroking the nape of Eddie\u2019s neck this time. It feels good, so he sighs and allows Venom to keep petting him.\n\u201cYeah, Romeo, I noticed when you ate the guy I was having sex with,\u201d Eddie mutters, exasperated and exhausted, \u201cI\u2019m yours. Message received, loud and clear. I\u2019m going to die a bitter, old sexless monk.\u201d He grabs the ginormous zucchini lying next to his face and adds, \u201cyou could at least get rid of the annoying heats for me.\u201d\nThe heats are healthy, Eddie, Venom coos soothingly, they are a sign of your fertility.\n\u201cFertility my ass, you just want to see me embarrass myself,\u201d Eddie sighs. The zucchini is pretty hefty in his hands. It\u2019s nice and thick. Eddie licks his lips.\n\nWe are not sticking a\u00a0squash inside us.\n\n\u201cParty pooper,\u201d He accuses, flicking the gross tentacle when it wanders too close to his face. Venom growls and delivers a stinging slap to his backside. He yelps and flinches away from the contact.\n\u201cMotherfucker! Quit it, Venom.\u201d\nThe symbiote has the nerve to chuckle in his head.\nEddie\u2019s cellphone goes off on the counter, so he reluctantly gets to his feet and maneuvers his way across the ruined groceries over to the couch.\nHe answers the phone, \u201cEddie Brock speaking. Hey Marcy, how\u2019ve you been? You called the office? Yeah, I\u2019m taking a few days off, personal matter,\u201d Eddie wanders over to the calendar on the fridge door. There is one last blank squares before the dreaded date. \u201cSeriously? You got a lead on that missing children\u2019s case? Where? It\u2019s time sensitive, huh? Uh, I\u2019ll see what I can do. Yeah, no worries. Thanks so much for calling. You have a great day too.\u201d\nEddie hangs up the phone, mind already racing through the possibilities. Technically, he\u2019s supposed to be off for the rest of the week and a healthy chunk of next week as well, but Marcy, the pretty beta nurse at the homeless shelter has just spotted the guy Eddie\u2019s been trying to track down for the past two weeks. It\u2019s just too good of an opportunity to pass off on, even though the shelter is in one of the shadiest San Francisco neighborhoods and he is so close to his heat.\nEddie grabs his jacket and keys and heads for the door.\nFor Venom, the hunger never really goes away.\nThe impulse is a constant hum in the back of his mind. He keeps it from Eddie because he wants to be good, but occasionally, it becomes almost too much to bear. Like now, for instance. They are sitting in a packed cable car and rattling their way to whatever borough Eddie is headed and Venom can smell the alphas around them, two sitting up in front, another less than a foot away from Eddie, and three more in the back of the trolly. He wants to eat them the most, especially the one closest to Eddie who has been eyeing his host with clear interest for the past five minutes. Eddie\u2019s attention is glued to his phone, so he doesn\u2019t notice. He\u2019s watching a blurry video of someone wearing red and black with the headlines: Exclusive Footage of Spider-Man Spotted in LA!\nEddie thinks Spider-Man is graceful.\nThe realization sends a hot, stabbing pulse of annoyance through Venom. We are NOT fat! You take that thought back, Eddie.\n\"We scaled the side of a building and left a trail resembling bulldozer tracks, Venom, which is a little too King Kong-esque for my comfort, so yeah, I\u2019d say we\u2019re for sure fatter than Spider-Man,\" Eddie points out distractedly, still scrolling down the webpage. There are more pictures of Spider-Man caught in mid-swing, lean body arching through the air like a dancing ballerina. There are also quite a few closeups of jiggly man-parts in spandex that Venom wants to erase permanently from their collective memory. Eddie\u2019s body is not as small or compact as Spider-Man, but Venom thinks they\u2019re just the right size.\nI am adding him to the list, he tells Eddie.\n\u201cWho? Spider-Man?\u201d Eddie asks quietly, \u201cseriously?\u201d\nVenom has been keeping an ever-expanding list of names of folks he wants to maim/kill/eat ever since things have calmed down for them. Said list includes that guy from the Old Spice commercials with the massive man-boobs who yells too much, Mr. Clean, Mrs. Chen\u2019s rude nephew, and the the red inflatable tube dude in front of the car dealership a few blocks from Eddie\u2019s apartment. And now Spider-Man.\nYou like him, so I am adding him to the list, Eddie. He finds that the best way to force Eddie to lose interest in someone is to place them on The List. Sure enough, Eddie caves almost immediately.\n\u201cI do not, I like you, ok? Only you. Don\u2019t try to kill Spider-Man. He\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Eddie murmurs into the mic attached to his earbuds. The teenage girl sitting in the cable car seat next to them shoots them a weird look.\nI like you too, Eddie. He purrs back, his entire being thrumming with pleasure. Eddie is his, and his alone.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re rooming together, bud,\u201d Eddie agrees, biting his lip and trying not to fidget in the crowded space. Venom can tell that the different scents in the cable car are making him uncomfortable. His heartbeat has been pushing the upper 140s for the past ten minutes and the aggressive alpha pheromones are not helping. The stranger shuffles a little closer to where Eddie is seated and Venom growls. He materializes slowly, seeping through the innermost layer of Eddie\u2019s long sleeve shirt and migrating upward, pressing lovingly against Eddie\u2019s bare skin along the way. Venom settles around the omega\u2019s neck like a scarf. Up close, he smells ripe, like a deliciously fresh apple, just sitting there and waiting for someone to sink their teeth into him and lap up the sweet juices\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re drooling on me, V,\u201d Eddie hisses quietly, \u201cwhoever you are fantasizing about eating, stop it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not drool, he\u2019s told Eddie a million times, but then, the car screeches to a violent stop and they get off. The bustling sounds die down to a comfortable muted background hum. The sound of their boots on the road is strangely soothing and Eddie calms visibly, so Venom decides not to pursue the subject, opting instead to curl a tendril of himself over the bare skin above Eddie\u2019s heart. His human does not miss the little comforting gesture, for Eddie pats him gently with a smile and starts walking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe lead turns out to be a trap.\nEddie is too trusting for his own good, something that Venom has noticed with varying degrees of annoyance. He still believes in the inherent goodness of mankind. Eddie has faith in what he does, the people he meets, and Venom. He trusts Venom, who had been sent to his planet to conquer it. It\u2019s not a very good evolutionary trait, this trust. Venom doesn\u2019t understand how Eddie has survived for so long without him.\nHe smells it first, that familiar sour stench Venom has come to associate with nerves and guilt. It\u2019s coming off of the little nurse walking in front of Eddie in palpable waves, Mary or something. Venom doesn\u2019t recall her name, but she\u2019s the one who made the phone call to Eddie. She\u2019s leading them into the back of the homeless shelter and down a flight of stairs. He contemplates whether he should inform Eddie or bypass his control and snap her neck right now to get rid of the possible threat. Eddie will probably hate both options. He trusts the nurse, Venom can tell.\nHe get a little too preoccupied weighing both options, so when she twists around with a syringe, Venom reacts a fraction of a second slower than usual, which allows the sharp metal needle a chance to embed itself in the flesh of Eddie\u2019s palm. Something cold and foreign seeps past the layers of muscle and tissue to flow into their bloodstream. Venom chases the substance, cornering the molecules and destroying them before Eddie\u2019s body can even register the intruders.\n\u201cWhat the hell, Marcy?\u201d Eddie is yelling in the background, his fingers tight around the woman\u2019s wrists, preventing her from taking another stab at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I had no choice, they threatened my parents,\u201d She\u2019s crying, the little traitor. Venom snarls and materializes out of Eddie\u2019s back. Marcy screams at the sight of him.\n\u201cNo, Venom, we\u2019re not killing her,\u201d Eddie snaps, blocking the symbiote's wild lunge with his left arm. \u201cTell me who they are, Marcy. Are the children still alive? Who\u2019s responsible for this?\u201d\n\u201cT-the church,\u201d Marcy hiccups, utterly terrified. Her eyes are still glued to the black alien protruding from Eddie\u2019s shoulder. Venom bares his gleaming teeth at her. \u201cThey\u2019re k-keeping the live ones under the church two blocks away. I don\u2019t know what for, I just know that they a-always ask us to send them a note when the young ones under e-eighteen come into the shelter. I\u2019m so sorry, Eddie, please don\u2019t k-kill me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn yourself and your known associates in, Marcy,\u201d Eddie tells her, \u201cor I\u2019m going to send my friend after you, understand?\u201d\nShe nods tearfully, still staring at Venom.\n\n\u201cAre you sure we cannot eat this one? She is bad, is she not, Eddie?\u201d\n\nMarcy lets out a loud body-wracking sob and goes limp in Eddie\u2019s arms. It is a rather pathetic sight to behold.\nEddie grimaces, \u201csorry bud, not this one. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find an actual human meat buffet at the church. Just don\u2019t get any on this jacket. It was a gift from Anne.\u201d\n\u201cYou are too good to me, Eddie,\u201d Venom chuckles, nuzzling affectionately into the side of his face.\nEddie sighs and carefully eases Marcy onto the floor, \u201coh, you know me, doll, I try my best to please.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe church smells of dust and old wood that has been under the sun for too long. Beneath it all, there is something else, something out of place, something sharp and clean. Venom is reminded of that dreaded MRI machine that had briefly separated him from his dear Eddie, because beneath the smell of that church is the scent of a hospital. He tells Eddie this as they climb up the side of the building. Venom takes extra care to tread gently this time. He wants to prove to Eddie that they are better than Spider-Man.\n\u201cWhat do you mean a hospital?\u201d Eddie asks quietly as they peer inside a tinted window. It is empty except for a solitary nun who is lighting candles by the alter.\nBlood and antiseptics, Venom describes in their head, we smell tears and the stench of death. And ice, there is also lots of ice.\nA wave of nausea washes through them. Eddie\u2019s stomach clenches and Venom feels sweat break out over their palms. The cute little hairs at the nape of Eddie\u2019s neck have all risen like tiny soldiers.\n\u201cVenom, I think they\u2019re trafficking organs,\u201d Eddie whispers urgently. His heart is racing again.\n\nHmmm. Such delicious snacks.\n\n\u201cVenom!\u201d\n\nApologies, Eddie. Got a little carried away.\n\n\u201cAre the orphan here?\u201d\n\nWe can sense tiny hearts beating beneath the floorboards, Eddie. Young, sweet, juicy hearts.\n\n\u201cDude, get a hold of yourself!\u201d\n\nIt is not our fault that your heat is driving up our appetite.\n\n\u201cSays the parasite who made my suppressants stop working!\u201d Eddie snaps back.\nWe told you not to call us that! Venom seethes.\nThey\u2019re too busy arguing to notice when their body starts to tilt on the narrow sill. For a brief moment, Eddie is suspended on the precipice, then, the balance is shattered and they flop to the left, crashing down upon the pews in an explosion of splintering wood.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d The nun yells.\n\u201cStill think we\u2019re not fat?\u201d Eddie groans and struggles out of the miniature crater in the ground. \u201cYou ripped my jacket, asshole!\u201d\nA hot bullet zips past, grazing painfully against the shell of his ear. Venom roars inside Eddie\u2019s head and takes over his limbs. Warm wet blood is trickling down the side of their neck. The nun, a young slender girl, pulls out a handgun from beneath her black robes and takes aim\u2014\nVenom throws out a tentacle and snaps her neck with a loud crack. Eddie shivers when Venom materializes inches from his face.\n\nThey smell us, Eddie. The others. They are coming.\n\n\u201cS-smell? Uh, what smell?\u201d Eddie stammers. His sweat, combined with the salty, pheromone-rich blood pouring down his neck, no, their neck is a dead giveaway.\n\nEddie, you must calm down. Trust everything to me. I will not let them touch you.\n\n\u201cO-ok, just don\u2019t hurt any good people, Venom,\u201d Eddie whispers, still staring down at the dead nun.\nHe wraps himself lovingly around his host, his precious Eddie. Venom will not let the bad men hurt Eddie, not while he is there to protect him. The hunt is so very satisfying. It has been a while since Venom unleashed himself quite like this. Eddie had been right about the feast awaiting them. He gorges on the screaming men until that sharp insistent hunger fades into a more manageable peripheral ache.\nThe church is silent once again. Venom can here the little chirpy insects rubbing their legs together in the grass outside. Eddie moans and averts their gaze from the bits and pieces left from Venom\u2019s feeding frenzy.\n\u201cThe kids, V, we need to find the kids.\u201d He insists.\nEddie, you are such a good human, Venom praises.\n\u201cThanks?\u201d The omega replies weakly, \u201ccan we get to them?\u201d\nOf course. Their boots make loud squeaking noises on the blood-soaked floor as Venom moves them over to stand by the newly-lit candles.\n\u201cOk? What now?\u201d\n\nNow I use my heavy ass to smash through the floor like the Hulk, Eddie.\n\n\u201cNot the time for sass, Venom,\u201d Eddie wheezes when they climb out of yet another dent in the floor. \u201cAlso, where is all this extra mass coming from?\u201d\nThe children are locked up in a metal bunker in the stone crypts below the church. Venom can hear them whimpering like the litter of puppies Eddie\u2019s neighbor had shown them a few weeks ago. He rips through the metal like paper and pokes his head inside. One of the tiny things screams and throws something at him from its cage. Venom swivels to look at the deadly projectile.\n\nEddie, is that\u2026a rubber nipple?\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s called a pacifier,\u201d Eddie sighs, \u201ccome on back inside, bud, I got this. You\u2019re scaring them.\u201d\nHe does as he is told and sits back to observe Eddie, who\u2026\n\u2026fails miserably in his attempt to calm down the dozen or so screaming children.\n\nThis is not working, Eddie. The noise they are making with their feeding holes is\u00a0annoying me. Make it stop.\n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s annoying me too,\u201d Eddie groans, \u201ccome on kids, quiet down. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d\nNo one pays them any attention. The blond one on the left has turned an alarming shade of magenta, a snot bubble pulsating from one nostril.\n\n\u201cQUIET!\u201d\n\nVenom rears out of Eddie\u2019s body and lets out a deafening roar, complete with the flying spittle and rows upon rows of sharp glistening teeth. The snot bubble on the blond kid bursts with a moist pop. Eddie mentally recoils.\n\nThis is why I don\u2019t want children, Venom.\n\nSilence falls over them.\nWe see your point, Eddie, Venom admits while the omega goes around and breaks each lock on the steel cages. The children that scramble out latch onto Eddie\u2019s torn jacket like little lampreys.\n\u201cYou guys are going to be ok, I promise,\u201d Eddie tells them, offering comforting hugs all around.\n\u201cYou smell like my mom. Are you a superhero?\u201d A little girl in pigtails asks, her arms wrapped tightly around Eddie\u2019s neck. Venom sniffs her curiously. Beneath the sterile scent of rubbing alcohol and fear, she smells of warm sunshine and milk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, sweetheart,\u201d Eddie tells her and hoists another toddler up against his chest. He turns to the rest of them, \u201ccome on, lets get out of here.\u201d\nThey get as far as the back alley when Eddie\u2019s knees suddenly give out beneath them. Venom manages to grab the two kids before they tumble to the ground. He sets them down gently and materializes over Eddie\u2019s shoulder.\n\nEddie, what is wrong?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d Eddie gasps. He\u2019s doubled over, curled into a tiny ball and shaking. Something is not right. There are alarm bells going off everywhere along Eddie\u2019s central nervous system. Venom can see them like little pockets of fireworks, bright sparks that travel almost too fast for him to comprehend. He doesn\u2019t really know what is going on, but the words are familiar. Venom has heard them repeatedly on TV shows and he knows what usually comes after.\nExcept Eddie is not pregnant.\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to poop?\u201d The symbiote guesses.\n\u201cNo, dipshit, my heat,\u201d Eddie rasps out a frustrated laugh and takes another shuddering breath. \u201cGet the kids out of here and call the police. Don\u2019t eat any more people, please.\u201d\nThen, just like that, he passes out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time they crawl back inside Eddie\u2019s apartment via the living room window, it is pouring outside and his host is soaked to the bone. Anne\u2019s gift jacket is a tattered mess, so Venom sheds it for them along with the rest of the cold soggy clothes. Eddie\u2019s mind is still sluggish and unconscious when the symbiote lays him gently down on the sheets. His skin has mostly air-dried at this point, except the spot between his thighs.\nEddie\u2019s inner thighs are slick to the touch with a wetness that tastes oddly sweet. It is intoxicating, Venom discovers. He wants more, so the symbiote noses closer and materializes halfway out of Eddie\u2019s body to spreads his host\u2019s legs. The clear, sticky liquid is coming from the pink slit behind Eddie\u2019s male organs. Curious, Venom swipes his tongue over it. More of the deliciously sweet nectar leak out, so he delves deeper into the soft, silky heat and tries his best to get to the bottom of the mystery.\nEddie whimpers and stirs. The muscles in his abdomen clench as his thighs clamp down around Venom\u2019s head.\n\u201cV-Venom? What are you doing?\u201d He stammers, eyes wide.\nBizarrely, his first instinct is to cant his hips up and drag Venom closer\u2026\n\u2026which is why Eddie freaks and kicks the alien symbiote hard in the face.\nIt\u2019s like kicking a half-deflated beachball and Venom jerks a little, startled by the sudden assault. The symbiote\u2019s tongue slips out of Eddie, ripping an undignified squeak from him.\n\u201cWhat the hell, V?!\u201d He\u2019s trying really hard not to look at the massive pink appendage curling its way around his left ankle. There\u2019s more black goo bubbling out of him, solidifying into the humanoid shape Venom prefers.\n\u201cEddie,\u201d It breathes down at him, \u201cwhat is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d Eddie draws in a shuddering gasp and tries not to panic. He\u2019s pinned to the bed like a rat stuck in a trap. He tries to close his legs without Venom noticing but a thin tendril of black slips down and flicks gently at the perky organ bobbing between his thighs. Another super embarrassing whimper slips past Eddie\u2019s lips, \u201cChrist, Venom. Stop!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d The symbiote asks, sounding genuinely puzzled.\nEddie lets out a hysterical laugh. It really is driving him crazy. \u201cBecause, fuck, umm, because what you did was sexual, ok? A-and humans, no I, I only do sexual stuff with people I like, Venom.\u201d\nThe roiling mass shrinks back a little, \u201cbut you like us, do you not?\u201d\n\u201cI do, buddy, but it\u2019s not the same kind of 'like' between us,\u201d He tries to explain, but Venom is no longer listening. Eddie can feel it rummaging around inside his head. Flashes of his past relationships flicker behind Eddie\u2019s eyelids, his previous heats with Anne, sneaking quick kisses with his high school sweetheart underneath the bleachers, that nameless guy he\u2019d fucked during a one-night stand a few years back. Then, to Eddie\u2019s horror, the erotic little snippets that he\u2019s been dreaming about on and off about a certain alien symbiote since the Life Foundation fiasco float to the surface like a bloated corpse.\nVenom swells with what Eddie can only guess as righteous anger. Fear courses through him when that massive maw cracks open and a tentacle as thick as Eddie\u2019s thigh coils tightly around his neck. He closes his eyes and braces himself for the pain.\n\u201cPussy,\u201d The symbiote hisses.\nHe chokes when Venom surges forward and crams its tongue down his throat. The rest of the black goo follows, leaving him shaking and stark naked on the bed. The background hum that has been a part of Eddie\u2019s life ever since Venom bonded with him is strangely absent and the sound his erratic heartbeat is painfully loud in the ensuing silence.\nGasping for breath, Eddie jumps off the bed and stumbles into the bathroom. He turns on the cold water and dunks his head into the sink. The icy water feels good on his overheated skin, but it does nothing to dampen the fire between his legs. Still panting, Eddie pulls open the righthand drawer and grabs the knotting vibrator Dan had handed him last week.\nNothing from Venom. No reaction whatsoever. In fact, Eddie can\u2019t even feel the symbiote anymore. He should be grateful for the sudden gift of privacy during his heat, but all he feels is a crippling sense of disappointment. And loneliness.\nHe\u2019s lost radio contact with his internal parasite for all of two minutes and he feels fucking lonely. Frustrated tears blur Eddie\u2019s vision as he climbs into the tub and curls up with the stupidly blue vibrator.\nHe takes a shuddering breath and croaks, \u201cV, are you still there?\u201d\nNada.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He mutters into the tiles, the knotting vibrator wedged under his chin like a makeshift microphone, \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m really bad at romantic relationships, like you have no idea how bad,\u201d Eddie sniffs and drones on, \u201cand we have a great thing going, being friends. And it should be weird and all, considering that you\u2019re a flesh-eating para- uh, symbiote from space, but it\u2019s not. I love hanging out with you and eating junk food together,\u201d he pauses before adding, \u201cwell, maybe not the pineapple pizzas, but everything else has been awesome, Venom. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I don\u2019t want to mess things up between us like I always do with the people that I fall in love with. Because if I do, you\u2019ll leave me for one of those muscular Stretch Armstrong types and I\u2019ll be all alone again\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat is a Stretch Armstrong?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this rubbery\u2014\u201d Eddie starts before his brain actually catches up. \u201cVenom?!\u201d\n\nCan we eat it?\n\nA thin tendril of black curls out curiously from the back of Eddie\u2019s hand. He sniffs and laughs, whole body sagging against the freezing bathtub in relief.\n\u201cOh, baby, we can\u2019t. It\u2019s a silly toy that I used to love as a kid,\u201d He explains, dragging up a mental image of the blond figurine. \u201cYou can pull on its limbs and it stretches a lot, hence the name.\u201d\n\nLike me.\n\nEddie smiles, \u201cwell, I suppose so, yeah. You kind of do stretch a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe goo covering his skin spreads, reshaping itself into something shaped like a hand. It threads its \u2018fingers\u2019 through his, and Eddie\u2019s heart stutters inside his ribcage like a startled bird, warmth blossoming over his cheeks.\nEddie, we chose you over our home world, over millions of brothers and sisters, Venom murmurs solemnly inside his head, we will never leave you. You are stuck with us forever.\n\u201cI see,\u201d Eddie breathes. His ears burn when he brings their clasped hands up to his face and presses a timid kiss to Venom\u2019s knuckles. \u201cWoe is me, I guess. I\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding, please don\u2019t eat me.\u201d\nHe takes a deep breath and asks hesitantly, \u201care we good then?\u201d\nNo, we are not. Venom rears its head out of his chest, that sinfully long tongue inches from Eddie\u2019s parted lips. The symbiote leans forward and whispers out loud in Eddie\u2019s ear, \u201cnot until you tell us what you really want.\u201d\n\u201cNng,\u201d Eddie shudders when the tentacles slither across his bare chest, brushing not so innocently over his hardening nipples. He closes his eyes and lets the humiliating fantasies flash forth in his mind. Venom chuckles darkly against his cheek, its tongue laving a warm wet trail down the shell of Eddie\u2019s flushed ear. More of the symbiote has materialized out of him, its hulking muscular body hovering threateningly over his nude form.\n\nSay it, darling. Speak and we will satisfy your every need.\n\nSlick is running unhindered down his trembling thighs when he finally caves in to his needs and tosses the useless vibrator out of the tub before throwing both arms around Venom\u2019s broad shoulders.\n\u201cFuck me, please,\u201d Eddie whimpers, burying his hot face against Venom\u2019s neck, \u201cGod, I want you to fuck me, Venom.\u201d\n\nAs you wish, Eddie.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNothing prepares him for the sensation of Venom\u2019s tongue up his cunt. Eddie\u2019s face-first in the pillow, bitting down so hard his jaw aches just so he doesn\u2019t start yowling like a cat in heat and wakes up the whole goddamn building. He\u2019s not sure what time it is, but it\u2019s gotten dark outside.\nSo sweet, my Eddie, the symbiote coos, slurping at his opening like it\u2019s a freaking popsicle.\nThe wet sounds are obscene, as are his bitten-off whimpering sobs. Venom pulls him closer and delves deeper. Eddie screams a little into the patch of web fabric against his open mouth when a thin tendril slips easily into his ass and starts to tap against his prostate. More are curling around his dripping cock, playing with the leaking tip and slithering around the base of him, tight enough to hurt.\nHands pull at his asscheeks and Eddie feels Venom flatten its tongue against his clit, toying with the little sensitive nub until his thighs are shaking like he\u2019s being electrocuted. The orgasm rips through him like a cannonball. It\u2019s a hot, pleasurable ache that begins in his abdomen and end in an explosion of wet heat between his legs.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Eddie sobs and rolls his hips, riding Venom\u2019s tongue as the symbiote greedily laps up his slick. He moans feebly when Venom extracts its tongue and collapses facedown on the wet patch of drool. Eddie feels the symbiote glide up his body, pressing light tender kisses along the sweaty skin of his back.\n\u201cEddie, we did not mean to insult when we called you a pussy,\u201d Venom says in his ear, sounding oddly reverent, \u201cit is quite lovely, your pussy.\u201d\nEddie laughs out loud at Venom\u2019s serious declaration.\n\u201c...Thank you? No one\u2019s ever waxed poetry about my vag right after eating me out, so that\u2019s a first,\u201d He wheezes. Eddie\u2019s ridiculously proud that he even manages to pull off sarcasm when his brain and body feel like soft silly putty. He wriggles onto his back and grins up at the symbiote hovering possessively over him. Eddie cups Venom\u2019s cheek with an affectionate hand and murmurs, \u201cyou really are something, you know that, love?\u201d\nVenom purrs in delight and presses up against Eddie\u2019s palm. He smiles and pulls the symbiote down for a kiss. \u201cTell me that\u2019s some form of phallic protrusion I\u2019m feeling against my hip and not the zucchini from the fridge.\u201d\nWe threw away the squash when you weren\u2019t looking, Eddie, Venom says slyly, brushing its tongue over Eddie\u2019s lips.\n\u201cAwesome. I guess we really were made for each other then,\u201d Eddie laughs and opens his mouth. Kissing is a little awkward on account of the rows upon rows of sharp teeth and it feels more like he\u2019s deep-throating a dick rather than making out with Venom. Eddie chokes on a gasp when he feels the tentacles stroke pointedly over his wet slit, one of the little tendrils dipping inside experimentally.\n\nEddie, may I?\n\nHe nods urgently and hikes a leg over Venom\u2019s waist. The thin tentacle slithers inside without much resistance, pushing deep and testing Eddie\u2019s limits. He\u2019s in heat and so wet he\u2019s practically dripping so there\u2019s no pain. The appendage thickens and stiffens into a dick-shaped protrusion that withdraws slightly before slamming back inside his cunt with a wet squelch.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Eddie moans, \u201choly shit, holy shit.\u201d\nYou should hold onto something, Eddie. There is a trace of amusement in Venom\u2019s voice when the symbiote wraps its massive paws around Eddie\u2019s hips and presses him down onto the rumpled sheets.\nIt\u2019s fast and brutal, and underneath the haze of euphoria and pleasure, Eddie knows he\u2019s going to feel the burn for days. Venom\u2019s ruined him for any other potential partners. That fleeting thought pulls a possessive growl from the alien parasite fucking him into the mattress and the cock in Eddie\u2019s cunt swells thicker. He sobs and clings to the hard cords of muscle on Venom\u2019s back, rolling his hips to the punishing thrusts.\nThe bed is creaking like an old accordion beneath them, and for a wild moment, Eddie\u2019s mind wanders to the old lady living on the floor below. Even she wouldn\u2019t need her hearing aids to pick up the noises Eddie\u2019s making. What if her teenage grandson was home? Would he recognize the sound of Eddie being fucked within an inch of his life and loving every second of it?\nFrom now on, there is only us, the symbiote murmurs against his cheek. Venom is pulling them off the bed toward the full-length mirror Anne had left in Eddie\u2019s apartment after their breakup. Look, Eddie. See how exquisite you are to us, how well you take our cock.\nHe follows Venom\u2019s gaze and sees his own reflection in the glass, sees the blotchy red blush running down his chest, the black tendrils playing with his nipples, and down to that thick almost live thing drilling its way inside his willing body, pushing out his stomach and coiling up inside him like a\u2014\nEddie wails and seizes up, milky white ropes of come splattering against the surface of the mirror. Venom fucks him through the aftershocks. It scoops up some of Eddie\u2019s spend and smears it over his swollen lips. The tendril slips into his mouth and mimics the same thrusting motions in his ass. Eddie groans, eyes fluttering shut and hollowing his cheeks as he sucks on the intrusion.\nSuch a good boy, Eddie, Venom growls, so needy. So sweet.\nIt shouldn\u2019t turn him on, Venom calling him a good boy, but it kind of does, and judging by the ghostly chuckle inside his head, the symbiote is well aware of it.\nOnly this part of us is inside of you right now, Eddie. The symbiote's large, clawed hands reach down and parts Eddie\u2019s shaking thighs to reveal the two thick tentacles stuffed up his ass and cunt. Catching his gaze, Venom slowly sheathes itself back in him. Eddie whimpers and tightens around the intrusion. He can feel a curious bulbous swelling starting to catch on the rim of his hole every time Venom pistons into him and the thought sends a stab of fearful excitement through Eddie.\nIt\u2019s a knot. Venom is going to knot him.\n\u201cW-wait, V, s-stop for a sec,\u201d Eddie hiccups weakly.\n\nYou want this.\n\nThe pressure is mounting in his lower abdomen again, this time accompanied by a prickling soreness. Venom picks up the force of its thrusts again.\nHe\u2019s going to come again.\nEddie sobs. \u201cVenom, please, I need\u2014\u201d\nSharp teeth fasten onto the gland at the base of Eddie\u2019s neck and his spine goes taunt as the orgasm rips through his body. Eddie\u2019s only vaguely aware that he\u2019s squirted an embarrassing amount of slick onto the already soiled mirror when Venom\u2019s inflated knot locks them into place. Eddie\u2019s boneless in the symbiote\u2019s arms, cradled like a precious thing in the writhing mass of black goo. He feels like he\u2019s floating in a cloud of post-coital bless.\n\nCome back to us, Eddie. We are not done with you yet.\n\n\u201cChrist, Venom, if this keeps on, I\u2019m either going to die or piss myself,\u201d Eddie moans, but when the slick tongue taps eagerly at his closed lips, he parts them willingly.\nEddie\u2019s not sure, but he thinks he finally passes out somewhere between the fifth and sixth orgasm.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie wakes to the sight of sunlight pooling on his sheets. He\u2019s back on the bed, sore but sated, and wonderfully, wonderfully warm. Eddie stirs a little and feels the heat behind him shift along with his movement. A familiar tongue lazes across Eddie\u2019s cheek in silent greeting. Venom is a comforting mass behind him, curled around Eddie\u2019s relaxed form.\n\u201cYou let me be the little spoon,\u201d He blinks sleepily at the symbiote.\n\nNonsense, Eddie. You are not a eating utensil.\n\nHe laughs at the words.\nEddie\u2019s slept with his internal parasite and nothing\u2019s changed between the two of them. He relaxes back into the warm sheets with a contented sigh.\n\u201cNo, I guess I\u2019m not, buddy,\u201d Eddie agree and threads his fingers through the clawed ones splayed across his belly. Venom hums happily behind him. Eddie smiles and closes his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n  Two Weeks Later  \n\n\u201cSo, how was the honeymoon in New York City?\u201d Anne asks as they step out of the little coffee shop.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie burns his tongue mid-sip. He clears his throat and rasps, \u201cHow did you know I went to New York?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, your significant other told me,\u201d She says with a positively wicked smirk, \u201cwell, Venom didn\u2019t really say so specifically, but I kind of deduced it from our back and forth text conversations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat text conversations?!\u201d Eddie sputters.\n\u201cIt was more of a mixture of threatening messages to me about how you belong to him now, questions about your sexual preferences in bed, and requests for good places to take someone for a romantic date,\u201d Anne shrugs, her grin widening at Eddie\u2019s darkening blush. \u201cBy the way, Venom, you should pee in a circle around Eddie, that way everyone will know he belongs to you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, do not do that, don\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Eddie cuts in before the symbiote actually decides to take Anne\u2019s advice and urinate on him in public, not that he thinks it can actually pee. Can it?\nWe can pee if we choose to, Eddie. Venom answers the unspoken question in their head.\n\u201cAwesome. This is just freaking awesome,\u201d Eddie groans. \u201cI\u2019m throwing my cellphone away.\u201d\n\nThat will not stop us from communicating with your ex-lover.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me how the honey\u2014\u201d\nEddie rubs at his temple, \u201cIt\u2019s not a honeymoon, we\u2019re not married, Anne.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure about that, Eddie? You two sure bicker like an old married couple. Fine, trip, cowards, how was your trip to the Big Apple?\u201d\n\u201cI got Eddie Spider-Man\u2019s autograph,\u201d Venom tells Anne proudly. The symbiote pokes a smaller version of its head out of Eddie\u2019s hoodie and accepts a piece of the warm chocolate cookie Anne feeds it.\n\u201cBy getting me his autograph Venom means we actually chased the guy down, threw him against an alley wall and threatened grievous bodily harm if he didn\u2019t sign the soggy pizza box Venom fished out of a nearby dumpster,\u201d Eddie sighs, \u201calso, I\u2019m pretty sure Spider-Man is actually a fourteen-year-old girl under the leotard.\u201d\nAnne gives him a disturbed look, \u201cand how would you know that?\u201d\n\u201cWe gave Spider-Man a hug,\u201d Venom tells her.\n\u201cI can assure you that it was entirely nonconsensual,\u201d Eddie deadpans, \u201cthere was much struggling, elbowing, and cursing. Oh, and Venom drooled on the guy. We\u2019re probably not allowed back in New York anymore, because I\u2019m almost positive Tony Stark put us on one of his dangerous predators watch lists or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo what did you guys do with the pizza box?\u201d Anne asks, taking a left turn.\n\u201cIt is in a frame\u00a0on the living room wall,\u201d Venom says while Eddie pauses to take another sip of his latte.\n\u201cOk, so super disturbing,\u201d She nods, handing Venom the rest of the cookie. To the average passersby, it probably looks like she\u2019s cramming food down Eddie\u2019s shirt. \u201cBut the rest of the date, I mean trip, went ok?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Eddie shrugs and stifles a yawn, \u201cI don\u2019t remember much, it was all a big blur. I think we drank some water out of a bird feeder in someone\u2019s backyard, and Venom wanted to fight a homeless guy for a dumpster jacket, and we ate a pigeon in Central Park, so yeah, I think it\u2019s better that I don\u2019t remember most of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very nice jacket, Anne. There was a kitty on the back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you meant tiger, Venom?\u201d Anne laughs, \u201cand that does sound like an awesome jacket.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage it, Anne, you\u2019ll ruin my house-training routine,\u201d Eddie sighs and waves at Dan, who is sitting on the lone bench outside the newly christened orphanage. The other omega waves back with a beaming smile.\n\u201cSo when are the two of you tying the knot?\u201d Eddie asks as they wait for the light at the intersection to go green. \u201cBiological clock is ticking, Anne. If you\u2019re waiting for my approval, you got it, because that guy there is a saint and honestly you probably don\u2019t deserve him.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Eddie, you just say the sweetest things, don\u2019t you?\u201d Anne grits out between clenched teeth.\n\n\"Eddie and I would like to be one of the bridesmaids.\"\n\n\u201cWell, technically we\u2019d be a groomsman,\u201d Eddie argues, frowning. It\u2019s pretty confusing now that he thinks about it. Anne drags him across the street to her fianc\u00e9 when the light switches to green.\n\u201cSo, how are the kids settling in?\u201d She asks Dan, cheeks a little flushed.\n\u201cI think they like the new establishment much better than being locked up inside a steel cage,\u201d He hands them each a bag of clothes for the new orphanage and picks up a massive cardboard box. \u201cI got the whole hospital staff to donate and we picked out a couple dozen books for the new place.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s named after your law firm,\u201d Eddie squints up at the silver plaque over the doors.\n\u201cYeah, I talked the senior partners into investing our annual charity fund into the place after I saw your piece in the news,\u201d Anne says with a shrug. She pushes open the door and leads both omegas into the new orphanage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of a publicity campaign launched to put a positive spin on Anne\u2019s firm to cover up the fact that they\u2019re representing a super shady company up in New York,\u201d Dan explains quietly in Eddie\u2019s ear.\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d Eddie hisses back, pulling out a rumpled notepad from his back pocket, \u201cyou remember the name of the company, Dan?\u201d\n\u201cI will make sure that the money does indeed go into this place and not into buying one of the partners a private plane,\u201d Anne twists around and rolls her eyes at Eddie, \u201cso you can put that away, or I will.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Eddie mouths at Dan, who smiles nervously and walks over to the kind-faced receptionist at the counter.\nThe children they\u2019d rescued from the church come flooding out like a gaggle of baby ducklings. Eddie and Dan stand off to the side while Anne does her thing for her law firm. The CNN news crew tries to get a statement from Eddie, but he artfully evades her advances until the poor girl finally gives up. They stay long after the reporters leave and take turns playing board games with the children.\nOne of the little girls come running up to them when it is time to leave and hands Eddie a piece of paper with a shapeless, inky blob on it. He sees a tiny humanoid figure drawn in pencil buried under all that black.\n\u201cIs this for us?\u201d Eddie crouches down and smiles at her. She smiles back shyly and throws her arms around the omega\u2019s neck. She smells familiar.\nLike sunshine and milk, Eddie. Venom reminds him.\n\u201cThank you for saving us,\u201d She whispers in Eddie\u2019s ear, \u201cyou are my superhero.\u201d\nEddie buries his smile against the little girl\u2019s shoulder and hugs her back for the both of them. Venom purrs happily in his head, and if a thin tendril of black creeps out from Eddie\u2019s sleeve to join in on the action, no one notices.\nHe keeps his left hand tucked inside the pocket of his loose hoodie on the way home, Venom\u2019s fingers wrapped snugly around his.\nThey end up mounting the drawing next to Spider-Man\u2019s autograph.\n\u00a0\n\n.END.\n"
