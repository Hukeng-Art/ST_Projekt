    "text": "So, the whole \u201cKeith is half-Galra\u201d thing was kinda weird at first, but now it\u2019s almost normal.\nAlmost. \nWhen the transformation happened, back on Allura\u2019s ship after Keith had been hit by some crazy Galra Priest\u2019s lightning spell and doused in quintessence, it had been a shock to everyone, especially Keith. Everyone had different reactions \u2013 Hunk couldn\u2019t believe it, Pidge was speechless for once, Allura almost fainted, Coran shrieked, and Shiro activated his hand. Lance would never forget the look on Keith\u2019s face when Shiro had aimed his glowing palm at Keith, trembling and demanding in a broken cry to know what was going on, where\u2019s Keith, what have you done with Keith?!\nKeith hadn\u2019t answered. He hadn\u2019t been able to. He\u2019d just\u2026cowered; that was the only word for it. Lance had never seen a scared Galra before, but it was a pitiful sight \u2013 huge fluffy ears pinned back and drooping, yellow eyes wide and pleading, entire body curled into the smallest space possible. Before that, Lance hadn\u2019t been sure what to think \u2013 but in that moment he knew Keith was still Keith, even if he was way purpler than before. \nThe hug had been impulsive but Lance didn\u2019t regret it one bit. Keith had stiffened in his arms, obviously startled and confused, but Lance just kept hugging him, and eventually so did everyone else, all while Keith tried desperately not to cry in front of them. Lance was admittedly worried that Shiro would freak out again, but instead he\u2019d stared at Keith with eyes full of remorse and wrapped him up in an embrace that actually did make Keith cry. (Lance decided not to give him too much shit for that.)\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for you,\u201d Shiro had said. \u201cNo matter what. Alright?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Keith had whispered, in the tiniest voice Lance had ever heard.\nSince that soap opera episode, everyone started getting used to seeing a Galra aboard the ship. Keith wasn\u2019t always a Galra, which helped \u2013 as time passed he started to get better at controlling the transformation, or whatever. Pidge and Coran had run some tests and it all sounded complicated as fuck, but Lance liked to think of it like a werewolf, phases of the moon, all that. \nSometimes Keith had cute bat ears; sometimes they were just a little pointy like Allura\u2019s. Sometimes he was a lovely shade of lavender all over; sometimes he had patches and speckles of color over his normal skin. Sometimes his hair was black; sometimes purple and fluffy. Sometimes his eyes were entirely gold; sometimes they just glowed in the dark, which was freaky every single time. Sometimes his hands were clawed; sometimes his nails were just long. The pointy Galra teeth, thankfully, only seemed to make an appearance when Keith was pissed. It was nice to have those terrifying fangs on their side, for once.\nThe truth was, they knew fuck-all about what was happening with Keith. Allura claimed she\u2019d never even encountered a half-Galra human (half-human Galra?) before and so nobody had any idea what to expect. It would probably never become entirely normal just because new things kept happening. One day, Keith ate everything in the fridge without warning. Lance had no clue where he put it all, because the next few weeks he got even leaner and stronger, and when he took his shirt off for training Lance almost inhaled his tongue because that was just not fair. Even Shiro looked surprised. Then Keith started fighting\u2026differently. It wasn\u2019t super noticeable, but he got more aggressive, if that was even possible. Aggressive to the point of flat-out viciousness at times, to the point where he actually knocked Pidge unconscious and cut Lance\u2019s arm during training. \nLance might have been worried if Keith hadn\u2019t turned into an absolutely horrified mother hen afterwards. The second Pidge didn\u2019t get up, Keith was on the ground with them, eyes wide and voice panicked as he called for help. And when Lance hissed and clutched at his bleeding arm, Keith had dropped his weapon and insisted on helping to bandage it up. He\u2019d practically cradled Lance in his arms, like it was a mortal wound instead of a nasty scratch. Keith had never been so touchy-feely before, but Lance wasn\u2019t exactly complaining.\nAnd that was the thing. Or, more accurately, The Thing, because it was seriously messing with Lance\u2019s head. Keith was handsy some days (well, handsy by Keith standards), and other days he wouldn\u2019t go near anyone with a ten-foot pole. In short, he was acting really, really weird. That was part of The Thing. \nThe other part of The Thing was that Lance really wanted Keith to be handsy with him, which was even weirder. Like\u2026he couldn\u2019t explain it, but it was like suddenly he was seeing Keith in high-definition IMAX 3-D or something. And every time he got close to Keith he was just overwhelmed with\u2026something. Affection? Frustration? Longing? A mixture of the three? Lance didn\u2019t know what it was, but what he did know was that the dude smelled incredible. And that was almost weirder than the attraction to Keith, because teenage boys aren\u2019t exactly known for being fragrant, especially when they\u2019re fighting and soaked in sweat half the time. \nBut Keith still smelled so fucking good. He smelled\u2026warm. Like a campfire but without all the smoke. Lance couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it; he only knew that he found himself wanting to spend more and more time around Keith, which was confusing for both parties. But Lance had a feeling he wasn\u2019t the only one \u2013 at least two crew members seemed to be near him at all times, and when Lance asked Hunk about it he started nodding enthusiastically.\n\u201cI thought I was the only one!\u201d Hunk exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally weird. I thought he must\u2019ve been baking or something!\u201d\n\u201cBaking?\u201d Lance repeated, baffled.\n\u201cYeah, y\u2019know, since he smells like vanilla and cinnamon and\u2026\u201d Hunk trailed off at the expression on Lance\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Pidge!\u201d Lance called. Pidge looked up irritably from the new Rover they were tinkering with. \u201cDoes Keith smell weird to you?\u201d\nCoran, who was cleaning up the remnants of dinner, paused, eying the three of them. Pidge turned pink and shifted a little in their chair. \u201cI guess, if you think flowers are weird. Why?\u201d\n\u201cHe smells like flowers to you?\u201d Hunk glanced at Lance, comprehension dawning on his face. \u201cWait, what do you smell?\u201d\nLance shrugged. \u201cI dunno, but it\u2019s not vanilla or flowers.\u201d\nHunk frowned. \u201cYou think it\u2019s some Galra thing?\u201d\nPidge glowered at them both over their glasses, cheeks still pink. \u201cObviously. It\u2019s Galra pheromones.\u201d\nCoran left hastily, almost breaking a plate on his way out. Lance\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cPheromones\u2026but aren\u2019t those, like, for sex?\u201d\nPidge slow-clapped. \u201cGenius Lance strikes again.\u201d\nLance made a face. \u201cWhat?! Gross! I don\u2019t want to smell that, somebody needs to tell Keith to cut it out \u2013\u201d\nPidge scowled at him. \u201cKeith can\u2019t just cut it out, it doesn\u2019t work like that. He can\u2019t help it; he probably doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s releasing pheromones. Besides, if Keith was a girl I doubt you\u2019d be throwing such a fit about it.\u201d\nLance huffed. \u201cWhatever. Sorry if I don\u2019t want to smell his freaky sex perfume.\u201d\nPidge rolled their eyes. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I doubt Keith wants you to smell it either.\u201d\nLater that day, Hunk nudged him and said, \u201cBut I thought you liked Keith.\u201d\nLance gawked at him. \u201cNo! He\u2019s my arch-rival!\u201d\nHunk blinked. \u201cUh\u2026okay, but you still have a crush on him, right?\u201d\nLance spluttered. \u201cWha \u2013 why would you even think that, Hunk?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really subtle, Lance,\u201d Hunk told him, patting his shoulder. \u201cYou spend half your time on the training deck staring at him.\u201d\n\u201cWith boiling jealousy!\u201d Lance protested. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to memorize his fighting patterns so I can finally beat him someday!\u201d\nHunk patted his shoulder again. \u201cOkay, bro, if you say so.\u201d He did not sound convinced.\nLance felt betrayed. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth! Keith is the worst, with his stupid sword and his excessive muscles and dumb face and snarky comments and weird smell and \u2013\u201d Hunk was giving him a knowing look. Lance gave up. \u201cQuiznak,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI have a crush on a Galra.\u201d\nHunk grinned lopsidedly at him. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have a crush on Keith.\u201d\n*\nKeith was having a very strange day. \nThey\u2019d taken a break from fighting Zarkon to broker peace and write up alliances on the huge planet Everren, which was inhabited by an intelligent humanoid species called Sylphe. The Sylphe were determined to stay free of Galra rule, and welcomed Voltron\u2019s help and protection with open arms. Princess Allura had gladly accepted their invitation to stay in the Viridian Palace for the duration of the negotiations, and the Empress Velline had insisted that they were guests of honor there for as long as they liked.\nKeith had a suspicion that Allura had agreed to stay because Everren reminded her of Altea, and the Sylphe were not dissimilar to Alteans in overall appearance. Sylphe had pointed ears (albeit much longer and pointer than Allura\u2019s) and markings on their faces, usually spots or stripes of some kind. Their hair was also colorful like Alteans \u2013 some had Allura\u2019s silver locks, others had Coran\u2019s ginger hair, and there were plenty of pinks, greens, yellows, and blues too. They were very intelligent and could speak the Common tongue with ease, though they had developed their own systems of writing and language long ago.\nBut in other ways the Sylphe were very unlike Alteans. They were an arboreal catlike people with flexible tails and opposable thumbs on both hands and feet, which enabled them to dash through treetops as deftly as monkeys. Their eyes were slitted and, like a feline, their pupils dilated with changes in light. They disliked staying on the ground for too long, and had built most of their cities and villages high in the treetops of the heavily forested planet. \nAnd there was one other thing \u2013 they were very, very sexually promiscuous. \nThe Empress herself had received them in her throne room with another Sylphe in her lap, and only dismissed him after seeing the blatantly horrified expressions of her visitors. \u201cAh, my apologies,\u201d she said, smiling serenely at them while adjusting her skirts. \u201cWe often forget the sensitivities of foreign visitors to our\u2026public displays. Please, do not be offended by our openness. We are simply a species that values bonding and intimacy.\u201d\nAllura had smiled back, only slightly strained. \u201cOf course, Empress, we understand, and thank you again for your hospitality.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Velline, please, dear Allura,\u201d the Empress had replied, scanning the team with sharp green eyes. They\u2019d rested on Keith, unblinking. \u201cYou did not tell me you counted a half-Galra among your friends.\u201d\nA ripple of surprise had gone through the team \u2013 Keith had taken great pains to hide his Galra side before visiting the Empress, and the only evidence of it was a slight purple tinge to his hair and a few violet freckles on his hands and cheeks. Yet she had known what he was immediately. \nShiro had stepped up to his defense. \u201cKeith pilots the Red Lion of Voltron. He is a loyal and invaluable member of our team, regardless of his species, and Zarkon is his enemy as much as he is yours \u2013\u201d\nThe Empress had raised a hand, stopping him from continuing. \u201cPeace, paladin. I trust your judgment, and sense no malice in him. I only wished to convey my curiosity. We have seen so few of your kind here, but when we do it is always\u2026exciting.\u201d \nKeith had not quite liked her tone. He\u2019d narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve received other visiting half-Galras here?\u201d\nHer lips had quirked. \u201cReceived, yes. That is a good way to put it.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cThey\u2019ve long since gone their own ways, I\u2019m afraid. But you are welcome here, as they were.\u201d She inclined her head. \u201cYou all are.\u201d\nThat had been the start of the strangeness. After that first audience they\u2019d been shown to their chambers, which were surprisingly spacious, carved right out of the trunk of the massive tree that made up the towering Palace. Each paladin had their own little collection of rooms \u2013 a bedroom, a cozy antechamber, and a washroom. Keith\u2019s was spacious and surprisingly lavish for a tree; he even had a window and a balcony overlooking the rest of the city. The only downside was that his room was adjacent to Lance\u2019s, but it was a small price to pay for such luxury. \nThat first night, Keith had slept better than he had in ages. There was something undeniably comforting about going to bed on a lush tropical planet instead of in the lonely void of space. Maybe that was why he fell into such a deep slumber, and why, for the first time in a long time, he dreamed \u2013 not a blurry, confusing mess of images, but a clear, vivid scene playing out in his head\u2026so vivid that he remembered it in the morning when he awoke blearily, soaked in sweat and achingly hard in his pajama pants.\nThe dream had been about Lance. Lance, completely naked, on his hands and knees, arching his back obscenely into Keith\u2019s cock as he fucked him, one hand yanking his short brown hair back viciously, the other digging bruises into his skinny hip. You\u2019re going to come on just my cock, Keith had told him in the dream, in a voice too dark and sultry to be his own. And just like that, Lance had come with a whimper, his own cock untouched. \nKeith stared at the dark green canopy of his bed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he whispered to it. He dug his nails into the sheets, trying to get a grip on the urgent throbbing of his dick without actually, well, getting a grip on it. He closed his eyes and counted to ten. \nThe fabric ripped. Keith\u2019s eyes snapped open and he stared with dismay at the claws curling wickedly from his fingertips, shredding the fragile sheets easily. The purple spots on his hands were growing, too, spreading up his arms, and he felt the tell-tale tickle of his ears growing, and then \u2013 Keith froze. The familiar sensation of arousal was still there, but there was something else, too. Something not right.\nKeith kicked back the sheets and half-ripped his way out of the pants, staring at his cock curving up against his taut belly. His eyes widened. It was growing longer, and as he watched, his cock began to thicken too, past the point of what was normal. It seemed to stop, and then Keith was gasping in pained pleasure as the base continued to thicken into a vaguely round, swollen knob just above his balls. His breath shallowed. This was not normal. Not\u2026not human normal, anyway. But as the purple blotching continued to spread down his body and over his enlarged cock, Keith started to realize this might be Galra normal.\nHe swore again, gritting his teeth and urging his claws to dull down with frustration that only added to the tight twisting sensation in his gut, a kind of desperate urgency he had never experienced before. After an excruciating minute, Keith had his dull human nails back and wrapped his hand around his cock with a groan that felt ripped out of him. His thumb slid over the head and it was wet, shockingly slick already, and Keith could feel his cock jump against his palm, so large now that he doubted he could cover it with both hands.\nAnd the knob at the base was swelling with every stroke of his hand, pressure verging on too much, so sensitive to the touch it made him whimper. Keith squeezed his eyes shut and bit the inside of his cheek to stifle all his other overwhelmed noises. It was still early; he doubted Lance was up yet and he did not need Keith\u2019s moaning as his alarm clock. \nAt the thought of Lance his cock twitched again, and Keith panted, hitching his hips up to fuck his fist. He tried to banish the image of Lance bent over for him from his head, but he was fighting a losing battle, and besides \u2013 it might help to speed things up a little. Just thinking about the dream made Keith shudder and groan, helpless to his desire as, a few tics later, he spilled hotly over his stomach and chest with a defeated gasp. \nThere was a lot of come. No, really \u2013 a lot, so much that some actually hit his chin, which was ridiculous. And it seemed\u2026different than usual. Keith didn\u2019t study his own come or anything, but this time it was definitely thicker when he dragged his finger through it, wrinkling his nose at the texture. And it smelled\u2026salty. Really salty, like a huge whiff of seawater. That was concerning. \nAlso, there was the fact that he\u2019d just masturbated while thinking of Lance. None of these things were good. Possibly his dick was broken.\nOr\u2026not, because no sooner had his afterglow ended, it started hardening again in earnest. Keith stared at it. Okay, yes, he was a teenage boy, but that was impossible. It hadn\u2019t even been thirty tics! \n\u201cI am not jerking off again,\u201d Keith told it. \u201cI have things to do.\u201d\nThis did not deter his cock one bit, and he ended up having to jerk off not once, not twice, but three times before it finally calmed down enough for him to stuff it into his pants. He was still hard, but he wouldn\u2019t be poking anyone\u2019s eye out, and managed to find a Sylphaen tunic in his closet that went down to mid-thigh. It would have to work while he figured out what the fuck was happening to him. Keith already had several ideas and he didn\u2019t like any of them. In the meantime\u2026he just had to hold it together. Deep breaths. Ignore it. Internalize. Keith was good at internalizing.\nWith a shaky exhale, he left the room.\n*\nBreakfast was bearable at first, but Keith was itching all over and it made him irritable. He snapped at Hunk without meaning to and almost ripped the tablecloth with his claws when the idle chatter around him peaked. Shiro, who was sitting next to him, gave him a worried look, but Keith just shook his head and kept his hands under the table, silently panicking. \nLance tried to talk to him once and Keith almost knocked over his drink. Lance peered at him from across the table. \u201cHey, you don\u2019t look so good,\u201d Lance told him. \u201cDid you sleep at all?\u201d\nKeith\u2019s claws cut into his own palm. Control yourself. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d he snapped, sharper than he meant. \nLance frowned at him. \u201cNo need to get feisty, bat boy.\u201d He pointed to his ears and Keith flushed, realizing his Galra ears were making an appearance. Thankfully Lance stopped talking to him after that. \nBut Shiro just kept looking at him, and when he reached over and put a hand on Keith\u2019s arm, he literally had to grip the arms of his chair to stop himself from lunging at Shiro, which was definitely an urge he\u2019d never had before. Keith must have made a sound, maybe a hiss, because Shiro immediately let go.\n\u201cKeith,\u201d Shiro whispered, \u201cis everything alright?\u201d\nNo, it\u2019s not, my dick is twice its usual size and I came four times in a row this morning and my skin feels like it doesn\u2019t fit right and I can\u2019t control the Galra transformation anymore and, oh, I sort of have the urge to fuck everyone in the vicinity, especially Lance. \nKeith stood up abruptly, his chair screeching across the wooden floor. \u201cI just need \u2013 some air,\u201d he muttered, and with that he turned on his heel and walked away as fast as he could, which was pretty fast considering he was so hard that he was almost limping.\nHe didn\u2019t notice the Empress watching him go, a knowing gleam in her eyes as she dismissed herself from the table.\n*\nKeith stumbled out onto the nearest balcony, which was more of a secluded garden terrace. The fresh air did help to clear his head a little, but it did nothing to quell his body\u2019s ache. His knees felt wobbly as he leaned back against the wall, wrapping his arms around himself. He had always assured the others that he was in control of his Galra side; they thought he would never hurt them; they trusted him. But for a moment back there, Keith had almost lost that fragile control. He didn\u2019t know what this sudden urge was, exactly, but he did know that it was visceral and dangerous and he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold himself back for much longer. He had to\u2026he had to restrain himself, or somehow tell the others he wasn\u2019t safe before \u2013\n\u201cAh, there you are.\u201d The Empress Velline emerged from the swaying ferns, mere feet away.\nKeith went utterly still, pressed to the wall as closely as possible, trying to ground himself. He had never been attracted to females, but as she approached he realized with horror that this urge inside him did not seem to care. \u201cStay back,\u201d he pleaded, shuffling away from her. \nVelline tilted her head, shiny black braid falling over her shoulder. \u201cYou are nineteen, yes? Then this is your first heat.\u201d\nKeith gulped. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou are scared,\u201d she said, still calm, still coming closer. \u201cYou feel as if you need to mount everyone in sight.\u201d\nKeith turned scarlet. \u201cH-How do you\u2026\u201d\nVelline smirked. \u201cDo not worry. This is normal for a Galra\u2019s first heat.\u201d\nKeith needed her to take about three giant steps back, and even then he wasn\u2019t sure she would be safe. But the talking was distracting, and he would take any distraction he could get. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d he asked, dreading the answer.\nShe chuckled. \u201cTwelve cycles, or in Earth days, two weeks.\u201d\nKeith sucked in a harsh breath. He was going to die. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t...?\u201d\nVelline\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIf you attempt to resist the urge to mate, you will soon go into a very dangerous state known as a blood fever. In short, you will lose control of yourself.\u201d\nFear pounded through him almost as strong as the desire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone,\u201d he gasped, curling in on himself. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt my friends \u2013\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Velline murmured, and then she was right there, and her hands were on his face and Keith almost sobbed. \u201cJust let go, paladin. My court ladies and I will take care of you \u2013\u201d\nKeith realized what was happening in slow motion; his brain was sluggish, muddled with terror and arousal and revulsion. \u201cNo,\u201d he choked out, twisting away, \u201cno, stop, get off of me \u2013\u201d\nVelline clicked her tongue. \u201cTsk, tsk, I\u2019m doing you a favor. None of the other half-Galras had any complaints, trust me.\u201d\nKeith lashed out blindly, trying to shove her away, but she had a firm grip on his biceps and his body wouldn\u2019t quite obey his mind\u2019s commands. \u201cPlease \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHey! He told you to get off of him!\u201d\nLance\u2019s voice cut through the air like a knife, and Keith\u2019s heart thudded frantically as the Empress slowly stepped away, turning to face Lance coolly. He was standing where she had been moments earlier, bewilderment clear on his face as he looked at the Empress. Then his gaze fell on Keith and his eyes widened. Keith shrank back. \u201cKeith? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Lance glared at the Empress. \u201cWhat did you do to him?!\u201d\nThe Empress sighed and shook her head. \u201cI did nothing. I see now he has the assistance he requires.\u201d She eyed Lance critically, pursing her lips. \u201cA bit scrawny, but I suppose he doesn\u2019t care at this point.\u201d She glanced back at Keith as she walked away. \u201cHave fun.\u201d\nBefore Keith could warn him, Lance was jogging up to him. \u201cDude,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat was that? She was, like, all over you, and not gonna lie, I\u2019m kinda jealous, but you look seriously scared \u2013\u201d\nAccording to Velline, Keith had two choices \u2013 give in, or hurt someone. It wasn\u2019t much of a choice at all, but he wasn\u2019t about to tackle Lance to the ground and take what he wanted right then and there. So instead he looked into Lance\u2019s confused blue eyes and said, miserably, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this,\u201d and kissed him.\n\u201cMmph?\u201d Lance said. Keith groaned into his mouth and tugged him closer, and then, to his relief, Lance\u2019s lips started moving against his own, hesitant but willing, and his hand moved up to cup Keith\u2019s jaw and it was so good that Keith almost fell over, dragging Lance to the wall and reversing their positions until Lance was the one crushed against it, pinned between his body and the wood paneling.\nLance broke the kiss too soon, gasping for air and staring at Keith. \u201cHoly fuck, dude,\u201d he said in a small voice, and Keith didn\u2019t understand until Lance\u2019s hips nudged at his, and Keith realized Lance could now not only see but feel his never-ending erection. Keith opened his mouth to apologize, to tell Lance that he should really find some sturdy rope right about now, or maybe push him over the balcony, but then Lance bit his lip and looked at him through his lashes and all rational thought was gone.\n\u201cI need to kiss you again,\u201d Keith said roughly, fumbling at Lance\u2019s clothes like an afterthought. Lance\u2019s hands were fluttering uselessly at his sides. \u201cI want to touch you. I need to \u2013\u201d\nLance made a strangled sound and clutched at his tunic, eyes huge. \u201cKeith \u2013 wait \u2013\u201d\nKeith shuddered and pressed his face into Lance\u2019s throat, nuzzling at his pulse and letting Lance\u2019s scent fill his head; clean cotton and fruity soap. It calmed him down a little, enough that he was able to resist biting the delicate skin there as hard as he could, marking it as his own. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he panted, rubbing himself off helplessly against Lance.\n\u201cHey, shh, no, look at me,\u201d Lance whispered, and with effort Keith dragged his head up until they were eye-to-eye again. Lance\u2019s cheeks were flushed and his eyes were still wide with surprise but he didn\u2019t look upset. Freaked out, maybe, and stunned, but not angry. Lance swallowed and Keith\u2019s eyes followed the motion hungrily. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Lance said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just \u2013 tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nKeith tried to explain, but the sentences came out shaky and fragmented. \u201cApparently Galras\u2026go into heat \u2013 like dogs and cats, but\u2026\u201d Keith ducked his head down. \u201cEverything hurts, aches, it\u2019s getting worse, and,\u201d he let out a hiccupping breath. \u201cIf \u2013 if I resist it much longer I\u2019ll lose myself and people will get hurt, you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d\nLance was still holding on to the front of his shirt. \u201cQuiznak,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you \u2013 why didn\u2019t you say something earlier?\u201d\nKeith huffed out a choked laugh against Lance\u2019s neck. \u201cYeah, just announce to the whole table that I felt like bending over the nearest person and fucking them into oblivion. Why didn\u2019t I do that?\u201d\nLance sagged a little against him. \u201cOh,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cAnd you, um, still feel like that?\u201d\nKeith couldn\u2019t quite figure out the tone of his voice. He blinked. \u201cYes, but \u2013\u201d Keith paused, sniffing again at Lance\u2019s throat. Lance\u2019s scent had changed, and suddenly it hit him. Lance was, unmistakably and irrevocably, turned on. Keith\u2019s grip on the back of Lance\u2019s neck tightened, both of their breath shallowing as Keith pressed his thigh against Lance\u2019s cock, half-hard in his jeans. \u201cYou want me to fuck you,\u201d Keith said, shocked. \nLance clung to him. \u201cWhat, you thought I was gonna let you suffer through this pon farr stuff alone?\u201d He grinned, but it was wobbly.\nKeith didn\u2019t know what pon farr was, and didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou want me to fuck you,\u201d he repeated, more firmly, and for a moment his voice almost sounded like it had in the dream. \nIt made Lance shudder. \u201cNot here \u2013 your room or mine \u2013\u201d\n\u201cMine,\u201d Keith practically snarled, half-yanking him away from the wall. \u201cYes, fuck, fuck, Lance, I need you, need to be inside you \u2013\u201d\nLance tripped over his own feet, and Keith could smell the arousal pouring off of him in waves. \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m coming, Jesus, Keith, cool your jets \u2013\u201d\nKeith growled and dragged him off. His jets were on fire.\n*\nThey barely made it. \nAs soon as the door closed behind them Keith slammed Lance up against it, so close to snapping that his claws came out as he fumbled with Lance\u2019s shirt, and then the whole thing was shredded, hanging off of his skinny frame in ribbons that Keith impatiently ripped away. Lance gaped at him. Keith sucked on his neck contritely, and judging from the way Lance arched up into it, he was more than forgiven. Keith managed to will the claws away to unzip Lance\u2019s jeans, but then Lance was gasping and grabbing his wrists, and Keith smelled a spike of fear in his scent that made him draw back at once. \nLance\u2019s eyes darted away nervously. \u201cI just\u2026thought you should know that I\u2019ve never actually, uh. Done this before.\u201d\nKeith tilted his head. \u201cGotten fucked?\u201d\nLance chewed his lip. \u201cFucked in general,\u201d he admitted. \nKeith blinked, incredulous. \u201cWait. You\u2019re a virgin?\u201d\nLance scowled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be such a dick about it \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just \u2013 you flirt with practically everyone we meet! You\u2019re always acting like some kind of womanizer.\u201d\nLance\u2019s cheeks flamed. \u201cYeah, well, somehow nobody ever wanted a piece of this.\u201d Keith didn\u2019t need Galra ears to hear the self-deprecation in his voice. It made his chest twinge oddly. \n\u201cI do,\u201d Keith said. \nLance still refused to look at him. \u201cDude, you\u2019d probably fuck a cactus if it got close enough right now.\u201d\nKeith scrunched up his face. \u201cBelieve it or not, I prefer you to a cactus,\u201d he retorted. Lance snorted. Keith touched his face lightly. \u201cI prefer you to the rest of the team, too,\u201d Keith added, and Lance did look up at that, surprised. \n\u201cHmph. You\u2019re just trying to sweet-talk me so you can get on with it,\u201d Lance said, but he sounded unsure.\nKeith\u2019s hand dipped lightly under Lance\u2019s waistband, and he felt the way Lance jumped a little, still anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you\u2019re a virgin,\u201d he mumbled into Lance\u2019s jawline. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hot, actually.\u201d \u2018Kind of hot\u2019 did not even begin to describe the way the Galra part of his brain was absolutely howling at the thought of being Lance\u2019s first, the first to fuck him, the first to make him come. \nLance squirmed, breathing growing heavy as Keith\u2019s hand wormed its way into his underwear. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not as comforting as you think it is, bat boy \u2013 ah!\u201d Lance yelped. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re touching my dick.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm,\u201d Keith agreed, fingers curling around the length of him loosely, not really jerking him off, just feeling him up. His cock was hot velvet in Keith\u2019s hand, damp at the head and a pleasing weight as his hips stuttered forward. Keith\u2019s cock throbbed with every push of Lance against him, and Lance wasn\u2019t quite relaxed but his head had fallen back against the door and his mouth was open and he was so hot; Keith was fucking salivating just looking at the slender curve of his neck, the plush \u2018o\u2019 of his lips, the way his lashes fluttered against his cheekbones, long and dark. Keith fisted his cock with purpose and Lance gasped. \u201cYou look so good,\u201d Keith told him. Lance\u2019s eyes half-opened, dazed. \u201cSo good,\u201d Keith repeated, unable to stop talking now that he\u2019d started. \u201cI want you so bad, gonna make you feel so good, until you\u2019re begging for more, you\u2019re gonna look so pretty on my cock \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lance whispered. \u201cGalras are kinky.\u201d\nKeith couldn\u2019t argue with that. So instead he bit Lance\u2019s collarbone and asked, \u201cCan I suck you off?\u201d\nLance acted like Keith had just electrocuted him. \u201cW-wha \u2013 don\u2019t you just want to fuck me?\u201d\nKeith sucked a bruise where he\u2019d bitten. \u201cI want to make you come first,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck you eventually.\u201d\n\u201cO-okay, I guess?\u201d Lance said, and yet seemed entirely unprepared for Keith to drop to his knees and start unzipping his jeans eagerly. \u201cWait \u2013 right here? Against the door, where anyone could hear us \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Keith said, and then, once he\u2019d gotten Lance\u2019s jeans and underwear down and off, \u201cyeah.\u201d\nLance was staring down at him, mouth hanging open, hands flailing at his sides before flattening against the door. Keith nosed at the place where his body met his thigh and inhaled deeply, smelling Lance\u2019s arousal again, but stronger here, more concentrated, turned up to the nth degree. It was intoxicating, and his tongue flicked out to taste and that was even better. \nIt wasn\u2019t like Keith had never given a blowjob before (he most definitely had), but this was\u2026different. Different because of the heat, yes, but also because it was Lance, and everything Keith did would be completely new to him. Nobody else had touched him like this before. Mine, Keith thought nonsensically.\nHe laved his tongue against the base of Lance\u2019s cock and Lance\u2019s head thudded back against the door, shaking the whole thing. Normally Keith might be concerned about being heard, but now the thought just made him grin wolfishly before swallowing Lance down, ripping a cry from the Blue Paladin. Keith sank down further enthusiastically, until his nose met Lance\u2019s pubic bone and his throat was constricting around the tip as he started to bob his head. Lance thrust forward uncontrollably and Keith almost choked, tears pricking at his eyes, but he could\u2019ve cared less. \nLance was saying his name, or at least some garbled variation of it, thighs trembling under Keith\u2019s palm. He was so hot on Keith\u2019s tongue, and Keith could feel the blood rushing just beneath the surface of that delicate velvet skin. He could feel the heaviness of Lance\u2019s balls, too, when he cupped them with his free hand, squeezing until Lance moaned, cock twitching in his mouth. And all around him was that smell, male musk and sweat and Lance, and the urgency inside Keith eased suddenly, replaced by the need to savor this, to draw it out until Lance really was begging for whatever Keith would give him.\nHe drew back a little, lavishing Lance\u2019s cock with long, tender sucks around the tip, hollowing his cheeks and stroking at where his mouth didn\u2019t reach, then at his balls again, and then behind, letting one finger slip lightly over Lance\u2019s hole, furled and tight. Lance tensed, but Keith just kept circling it, never pushing in, and felt the tension leave him slowly, replaced by only pleasure. Lance was loud, of course he was, he never shut up normally \u2013 but Keith loved every single sound, loved that he could not only feel but hear Lance coming apart. \nIt didn\u2019t take very long before Lance was grabbing at his head, gasping, \u201cI \u2013 I\u2019m going to \u2013\u201d and coming in spurts into Keith\u2019s mouth. Keith had never particularly enjoyed the taste of come, but he found he didn\u2019t mind it at all this time, swallowing it down greedily as Lance slumped against the door. \nWhen he pulled off, he licked Lance\u2019s softening cock clean until Lance was pawing clumsily at his face, oversensitive. Keith got to his feet, pleased to see Lance looked even more dazed than before, barely able to stand. But Keith still hadn\u2019t gotten off, and wasted no time in kissing Lance soundly, crushing their bodies together, grinding his unbearably swollen cock against Lance\u2019s spent one. Lance whined but Keith gave him no quarter, dragging him away from the door and towards the bed.\nIf Lance was resisting he wasn\u2019t doing a very good job of it, and he landed on the bed with a little bounce when Keith pushed him. Keith took a moment to admire how ridiculous he looked; naked from the waist down with his shirt rucked up around his hips, staring at Keith with something like apprehension. \nLance licked his lips and said, \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019m pretty sure we both need to be naked for this to work.\u201d\nKeith narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou first.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, you shy or something?\u201d Lance retorted, but he took his shirt off, curling his knees up to his bare chest in an unexpectedly and ironically shy gesture. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Keith said, stripping his tunic off, not breaking eye contact. \u201cI\u2019m really, really not.\u201d He unbuttoned his pants, letting them slide off his hips as his cock was finally freed. He did not miss the way Lance\u2019s eyes widened comically, nor the way he gulped. \n\u201cUm,\u201d Lance stammered, \u201cis it \u2013 usually like that?\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Keith said innocently, sidling towards him.\n\u201cBig,\u201d Lance blurted, flushing. \u201cI mean, I-I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to\u2026fit.\u201d He gulped again, and flinched when Keith crawled onto the bed with him. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Keith murmured, managing to soften his tone though the primal instincts were coming back full force. \u201cLance. Calm down.\u201d\nLance peered at him owlishly from over his knees. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m calm. Mr. Calm, over here. What makes you think I\u2019m not \u2013\u201d\nKeith grabbed his wrist and guided Lance\u2019s hand to his cock. Lance squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to bite you,\u201d Keith said with exasperation. \u201cI might, though.\u201d Lance glanced at him, brows drawn together, and tentatively let his hand settle on the base, just above the knob. Keith\u2019s head dropped forward with a relieved sigh, and Lance blinked, fingers curling around its girth as far as they could.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of purple,\u201d he commented, sounding almost fascinated as his hand slid up the length of it. He reached the tip and definitely sounded fascinated when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026wet. Like, really wet. Dude, I think your dick is, uh, self-lubricating.\u201d Lance hesitated, then swiped a finger over the slickness and brought it to his lips, licking it off. \u201cWhat the\u2026it tastes good. Like strawberries.\u201d Lance blinked. \u201cDid mine taste like strawberries?\u201d\nKeith tried to tell himself that patience was a virtue and fought the awful impulse to shove Lance onto his back and fuck his mouth. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Lance breathed, \u201cyour, uh, ears are doing the thing again. And your eyes and your skin and \u2013 oh.\u201d\nKeith looked down at his clawed, purple hands, desire momentarily replaced by shame. His body was betraying him yet again. Having a Galra cock was one thing; being in full Galra form was another entirely. Desperately, he closed his eyes, trying to focus; to change back before Lance was scared off for good \u2013\n\u201cSo soft,\u201d Lance mused. Keith\u2019s eyes snapped open, startled. Lance was\u2026petting him, hand moving gently over his ears and hair. And his other hand was still absently stroking Keith\u2019s cock, undeterred by the fact that he was now in bed with a creature hated by most of the universe. Lance saw Keith\u2019s expression and smiled smugly. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re cute, bat boy.\u201d\nKeith bared his teeth and there, Lance faltered. Keith let his fangs extend and leaned close to Lance\u2019s face, razor-sharp canines inches from his parted lips. \u201cCute,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYou think this is cute?\u201d\nLance tipped his chin up defiantly. \u201cIt\u2019s adorable.\u201d His hands were still in Keith\u2019s hair, thumbs rubbing just behind his ears, which made Keith actually want to purr, and that was unacceptable. He snarled and grabbed both of Lance\u2019s wrists, pinning them to the pillows above his head with one clawed hand and rolling on top of him, delighting in the way Lance bucked and struggled against him. Keith glowered down at him, unyielding. \n\u201cTake it back,\u201d Keith demanded.\n\u201cMake me,\u201d Lance said.\nKeith shifted until their cocks were aligned, ignoring Lance\u2019s needy whine, and leaned down, tracing Lance\u2019s face with a single claw. Lance stopped breathing. \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d Keith crooned, claw sliding across his mouth, pressing it into his lower lip until a drop of blood beaded up. \u201cI could rip you apart.\u201d\nIn reply, Lance tilted his head to the side, baring his neck in utter submission. \nKeith growled and, overwhelmed with the need to mark him, placed his mouth over that smooth brown skin and sucked as hard as he dared. His teeth grazed flesh and Lance shuddered, pulse thundering in Keith\u2019s ears, arousal cresting as his cock hardened between them again. Keith applied more pressure, claw drawing more blood from Lance\u2019s lips, fangs seconds from piercing through vital veins.\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\nLance\u2019s voice brought him back from the brink and he lifted his head, admiring the huge red bruise he\u2019d left in his wake, high enough that Lance couldn\u2019t hide it under his shirt. And then his claws receded, blood smudging Keith\u2019s thumb when he swiped it over the thin cut, the scent of iron sharp between them. Lance\u2019s eyes were wild, fixed on Keith.\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d Keith asked, leaning over him, or perhaps looming was a better word. He expected more defiance, but instead Lance just moaned and spread his legs. Keith swore vehemently, and as soon as his fangs retracted, he kissed Lance soundly, the other entirely pliant against him, his mouth tasting strongly of strawberries. \nLance was making little sounds, and when Keith pulled back he pleaded, \u201cLet me go, I\u2019ll be good, I just wanna touch you, let me touch you,\u201d and Keith couldn\u2019t refuse that, releasing his wrists hastily and kissing him again as Lance\u2019s arms wrapped frantically around him, nails digging into his back.\nKeith nipped at the cut on his lip, the taste of blood spurring him on almost as much as Lance\u2019s legs hooking around his waist. \u201cLance, I need to \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Lance gasped, \u201cfuck me, fuck me, want you to, now \u2013\u201d\nBut Keith pulled back, groaning, pushing aside the need to flip Lance over and mount. He\u2019d meant what he said \u2013 he wasn\u2019t going to hurt Lance, if at all possible, which meant some preparation was required. Lance started to sit up on his elbows, impatient, but Keith nudged him back down, settling between his legs. \n\u201cKeith,\u201d Lance whined. \u201cI know I\u2019m gorgeous but now is not the time to contemplate my beauty!\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Keith said mildly, and this time when his finger circled Lance\u2019s hole the reaction was much better. His hips jolted up and his cock rose to full hardness, hands grabbing at the sheets and legs spreading wider. Keith hummed, satisfied, and looked down at his own cock, considering what Lance had said about it. Since they were in a Sylphaen palace, there was probably lube somewhere nearby, but why go searching when his cock was getting slicker by the second? \nHe took himself in hand, letting the apparently strawberry-flavored fluid pool in his palm. When he had what he hoped was enough, he spread it messily over his fingers and said, \u201cTell me how this feels,\u201d before pressing one finger inside Lance without further preamble. \nLance squirmed, stomach muscles clenching and unclenching. \u201cWeird,\u201d he said unsteadily. \u201cBut not\u2026not bad weird.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cAdd another one?\u201d Keith complied, twisting both fingers firmly, taken aback by how tight Lance was around them. He pushed them deeper, and crooked them blindly against what he hoped was the right spot.\nLance\u2019s moan echoed obscenely through the room. \u201cYes,\u201d he chanted, \u201cmore, yes, that, that.\u201d\nThere was only so much of this that Keith could take. But he gritted his teeth and added another, opening Lance up with three digits, and\u2026wait. If Keith wasn\u2019t somehow incredibly mistaken, he was pretty sure the makeshift lube was making Lance wet. \nObviously lube tended to do that, but Lance also felt somehow tighter and hotter and slicker around his fingers\u2026and from the way Lance was reacting it was like he was in heat too, literally begging to be fucked, all previous apprehension gone. Keith stared at his sticky hand. He didn\u2019t know what was in it, but it definitely wasn\u2019t strawberries. \nAnd he wasn\u2019t about to try to figure it out. Instead, he took Lance\u2019s legs and hefted them up over his shoulders, shoving a pillow under Lance\u2019s ass as an afterthought and lining up. Before he could even ask, Lance was chanting yes again frantically, so Keith wasted no time in doing what he\u2019d been dying to all day and fucked into Lance with one firm thrust, filling him completely.\nLance made an inhuman noise halfway between a sob and a scream.\nKeith, panting, peered down at him, stilling his hips though he wanted nothing more than to drive himself deeper into that perfect tight heat. \u201cDid I hurt \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNooo, nooo,\u201d Lance gasped, twisting under him, grabbing a handful of Keith\u2019s hair. \u201cJust, wait, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re so big\u2026\u201d\nThat should\u2019ve sounded like a bad line from a porno, but instead it was just incredibly hot. Keith nodded and kissed him, aiming for comforting, but the kiss quickly turned filthy, teeth clashing, and soon he couldn\u2019t stop himself from moving, though he forced himself to keep it slow as Lance quietly lost his mind.\nIt was interesting how he\u2019d been so talkative earlier, but now all he could do was make tiny, broken sounds, half-formed words that might have been pleas or curses or both. Keith was entranced by his expression, which warred between pained and pleasured as Keith deepened his thrusts, tugging Lance\u2019s hips up higher for better leverage. Lance was still hard as a rock between them, though, so it must not have hurt that much.\nThen Lance started speaking Spanish. Well, moaning Spanish, but either way it made Keith groan and fuck him harder. He was pretty sure that was what Lance was asking for anyway. He kept saying d\u00e1melo and m\u00e1s, m\u00e1s, clutching at Keith\u2019s neck and hips, hands slipping down to palm Keith\u2019s ass and force him deeper. Keith was so far past taking it slow, hips hitching faster and faster against Lance, the sound of skin on skin almost louder than the sounds falling helplessly from their mouths. \nKeith angled himself in a new way and Lance cried out, fingers twisting savagely in Keith\u2019s hair and biting into Keith\u2019s ass. Keith snarled and kept him pinned, thrusting relentlessly against that spot until Lance was writhing, desperate for release. \n\u201cTouch me, touch me,\u201d Lance was begging, cock leaking in wet stripes against their stomachs, the head pushing insistently into Keith\u2019s hip on every downwards thrust. He was close. \nIt was then that Keith remembered the dream, and it hit him like a punch to the gut. He wrenched Lance\u2019s head back, and hissed, \u201cYou\u2019re going to come on just my cock.\u201d\nAnd Lance did, mouth opening in a silent scream as he spilled between them in a messy rush, whining low in his throat and tightening around Keith, viselike. Keith bit at the juncture of Lance\u2019s neck and shoulder and followed him over the edge, sucking another bruise into Lance\u2019s skin as his cock pounded through it, through his own come that just made Lance even slicker, trickling out on his inner thighs and the sheets. But the urgency did not leave Keith, and his cock was still thick and aching for more, so he kept going. \nLance squirmed and gasped and he was still hard, mewling as Keith sat back on his heels and fucked Lance on his knees, the bed creaking alarmingly as Lance arched into it, come-covered cock bobbing darkly against his belly. Lance\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cPor dios,\u201d he babbled, \u201chow \u2013 Keith, I\u2019m still \u2013 it\u2019s not enough \u2013\u201d\nKeith pushed in as deep as he could, up to the flared knob at the base of his cock, which had somehow widened even further. He kept himself there, letting Lance feel the whole length of him, watching the way Lance quivered, a red flush spreading down his lean body, chest heaving as he sucked in frantic breaths. Keith narrowed his eyes and took Lance\u2019s cock in hand, pumping it in rhythm with his hips as he started to move again, slow and deep. \n\u201cStill not enough for you?\u201d Keith retorted, and Lance actually whimpered, a tiny, vulnerable sound that even gave the Galra part of him pause. He covered Lance\u2019s body with his own again, lowering Lance\u2019s trembling legs so that they rested on the bed. The Blue Paladin was clearly overwhelmed, eyes falling shut when Keith nuzzled at his neck, kissing the bruises and smoothing his hand soothingly down Lance\u2019s side. \u201cYou\u2019re so good,\u201d Keith murmured, kissing his ear. Lance shivered, burying his face into the pillows. \u201cPerfect, taking my cock like you were made for it, I could fuck you forever.\u201d \nLance\u2019s cock jerked in his hand and then he was coming again, mouth opening eagerly as Keith kissed him through it, tongue soft and lazy. He pulled back and Lance exhaled, sprawled out on the sheets wantonly, face the definition of ecstasy. Keith could see his dick stirring again, slower this time but definitely still onboard with the steady movements of Keith\u2019s cock. \nKeith couldn\u2019t stop touching him, not just his dick but his thighs and his ass and his stomach and his chest, marveling at how skinny Lance was so much stronger than he looked, muscles shifting under bronze skin, tendons standing out in his neck and hand clenching hard in Keith\u2019s hair when Keith made him come a third time. \nKeith came again soon after, filling Lance nearly to the brim. He pulled back until only the tip of his cock was inside, and come dripped out in his wake, shockingly white on Lance\u2019s brown thighs and ass. Lance wriggled in displeasure at the loss and pressed Keith back in with his legs, eliciting moans from them both. \n\u201cThat all you got, bat boy?\u201d Lance taunted, nails scraping down Keith\u2019s back. His voice was weak and uneven but Keith growled and rose to the challenge, bending down and exploring Lance\u2019s body with his mouth, sucking one of his taut nipples and feeling Lance\u2019s heel dig sharply into his lower back, spine bowing. Keith nipped at the pink nub and Lance shouted, slow intimacy lost to the sting of Keith\u2019s teeth and the wild buck of Lance\u2019s hips. Keith didn\u2019t know how long they\u2019d been going and he didn\u2019t care. \nThe sunlight streaming in from his bedroom window cast Lance\u2019s body in a gold radiance, and he was so beautiful as Keith fucked him, head thrown back and cock sliding slickly through his long fingers. Keith told him so and Lance laughed, disbelieving, which made Keith angry for some reason. \u201cYou are,\u201d Keith insisted fiercely, nails turning half-claw, sliding through Lance\u2019s short hair and digging into his scalp, leaving faint red lines behind. \u201cSo fucking pretty, Lance.\u201d\nLance swore vehemently at him in Spanish and Keith shut him up with his cock, which proved to be very effective. Lance looked best like this, he decided, needy and flushed under him, mouth red and shiny from kissing. If Keith had been more capable of rational thought, he might have been worried he was hurting Lance because he was pretty sure he\u2019d never fucked anyone this hard, and definitely never this long; but Lance\u2019s pained expression was long gone, and Keith\u2019s cock moved so slickly in him. Keith couldn\u2019t remember fucking ever being so smooth, so easy, so good.\nLance\u2019s body offered no resistance, even when Keith\u2019s cock started pulsing a third time\u2026but this time was different.\nLance\u2019s eyes widened as Keith\u2019s cock grew inside of him, not lengthening but swelling, and Keith stared helplessly at Lance\u2019s hole, stretched nearly to the limit, leaking come and clenching around him involuntarily. Then, struck by some instinct, his gaze fell to his own cock, to the knob at the base which was throbbing, wider than the rest of his cock and twice as sensitive. Inside Lance, he convulsed powerfully. Lance made a choked noise that could have been his name.\nKeith\u2019s hands held his hips in a bruising grip. \u201cLance,\u201d he panted, \u201cLance, please, I need to \u2013\u201d\nLance nodded hastily, as desperate as he was. \u201cYeah, fuck, Keith, do it \u2013\u201d\nWithout any conscious thought at all, Keith shoved forward with all his strength, forcing the knob inside of him, and Lance keened, clawing at the sheets and Keith\u2019s skin as Keith ground his cock in and came harder than he ever had in his life, gathering Lance close and inhaling his scent, kissing every bit of skin he could reach, purring with approval when Lance came again, whimpering into his neck. \nKeith came for what felt like a long time, and when he regained control of himself, he was sprawled over Lance, still balls deep. He tried to pull out and they winced in tandem \u2013 the flared base of his cock wasn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. \nLance, absurdly, giggled. \u201cHeh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck.\u201d\nKeith bit his earlobe lightly. \u201cFor now,\u201d he mumbled, and peered down at him. \u201cAre you\u2026okay?\u201d \nLance blinked back at him, slow and totally blissed-out. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, buddy.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s brow furrowed, eyes narrowing in disbelief. \u201cDid you just call me \u2018buddy.\u2019 Seriously.\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Lance moaned, stretching and arching his back a little, trying to pull Keith closer, which at this point wasn\u2019t really possible.\n\u201cMy dick is in your ass and you just called me buddy.\u201d Keith\u2019s voice was getting higher. \u201cI think we\u2019re well past the \u2018buddy\u2019 stage!\u201d\n\u201cDude, chill,\u201d Lance said, reaching up and petting clumsily at Keith\u2019s Galra ears, which flicked irritably. \u201cYou smell\u2026so good. Co\u00f1o, Keith, that\u2019s not fair \u2013\u201d He tried to tug Keith down to kiss him and gave up halfway, arms flailing midair before flopping back down to the bed.\n\u201cYou are so high right now,\u201d Keith grumbled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure neither of us smell good.\u201d\n(That was a lie. To his Galra senses, the heavy musk of sex permeating the room was amazing. But to anyone in their right mind it would be disgusting.)\n\u201cHigh on sex,\u201d Lance sighed, shooting Keith the dopiest smile he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cIs that a thing?\u201d Keith grunted and tucked his face into Lance\u2019s hair. Lance patted his arm clumsily. \u201cMan, you must be wiped. I think I came like, a thousand times.\u201d\n\u201cFive,\u201d Keith corrected, shifting experimentally backwards. Lance hissed and he stilled. Then Keith cracked an eye open. \u201cAre you getting hard again?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lance said, like it was a surprise to him too. \u201cYeah. Huh.\u201d He poked Keith in the ribs. \u201cCan we try to make it to six?\u201d\nKeith groaned and sunk his teeth into Lance\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cOw! Is that a yes?\u201d\nKeith lifted himself up on his elbows with effort and was relieved to find that his cock had softened enough to pull out. When he did, though, both of them sighed and it felt like a loss, somehow. Keith flopped off of Lance and onto his back, spent. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go again,\u201d he admitted, throwing an arm over his face. Lance pouted. Keith glared at him. \u201cFive times,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd I gave you a blowjob.\u201d\nLance was quiet for a minute. Then he said, \u201cMaybe if I gave you a blowjob too?\u201d\nKeith squinted at him. \u201cAre you deaf? I\u2019m too tired to fuck you \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Lance said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ll ride you. You can just lay there. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d\nKeith opened his mouth, then closed it. He couldn\u2019t really see a downside to that plan. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever.\u201d He tried to sound disinterested but his cock perked up at thought of Lance astride it. Lance noticed, and climbed over him, settling between his thighs and touching his cock like he had before, hesitant but curious. It was fairly large even when mostly soft, and still slick. Still alien, too.\n\u201cThis bump,\u201d Lance murmured, tapping the knob and making Keith shudder. \u201cThat was why you were stuck?\u201d He rubbed it thoughtfully.\nKeith\u2019s toes curled. Fuck, that felt really good. \u201cYeah,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGuess so.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a knot,\u201d Lance continued, cheeks pink. He glanced at Keith. \u201cYou know, like dogs?\u201d Keith stared at him blankly. Lance blushed further. \u201cMale dogs, uh, have a knot on their dick like this so that when they mate they can, uh. Keep it all in there.\u201d\nKeith kept staring at him. \u201c\u2026Lance, how the fuck do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cAnimal Planet had some weird shit, okay!\u201d Lance shot back. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Keith rolled his eyes and lay there for several more moments of pleasant fondling before Lance started talking again and ruined it. \u201cExcept I don\u2019t think male dogs go into heat, so I guess this is a little different. But you definitely kept it all in there, I\u2019m gonna be washing my ass out for weeks \u2013\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to suck my dick or just keep saying gross things?\u201d\nLance sniffed. \u201cThere is nothing gross about post-coital hygiene, Keith.\u201d But Keith counted it as a win because Lance shuffled closer, using the pillow to prop Keith\u2019s hips up this time, and licked a stripe up the side of his cock. \u201cStill tastes like strawberries,\u201d he said, and wrinkled his nose. \u201cSalty strawberries.\u201d\n\u201cPlanning to slobber all over it?\u201d Keith asked. \u201cRun with the dog theme?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lance snapped, before taking a deep breath and wrapping his lips around the tip determinedly and sinking down. He choked halfway, pulling off and coughing, embarrassed. \u201cSorry \u2013\u201d\nKeith frowned, feeling a little bad. \u201cHey.\u201d He lifted his hand and cupped Lance\u2019s face, his skin warm to the touch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Lance blinked at him softly, and nuzzled into Keith\u2019s palm. \u201cJust\u2026go slow. You can just lick it if you want to.\u201d He swallowed thickly. His head felt fuzzy, and it was hard to focus on much of anything with Lance looking at him like that. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Lance whispered. \u201cTell me what you like.\u201d\nKeith nodded, settling back against the pillows and sighing when Lance took ahold of the base, firmer than before, and started laving wet kisses over the tip, tentative but gaining confidence when Keith murmured his assent and let his hand card through Lance\u2019s hair. Keith\u2019s vision was hazy, just like the muted pleasure of Lance\u2019s warm mouth on him, mapping out the length of his cock with licks and sucking kisses. Lance reached the knot and closed his lips over it, lapping gently, sending pleasure prickling up Keith\u2019s spine and making it swell again. \u201cYes,\u201d Keith murmured, \u201clike that, good boy.\u201d\nLance groaned against his cock and sucked on the tip again, not trying to go down but working his hands over the rest of it. Keith knew Lance could feel him hardening, not from the Galra heat but from the careful attentions Lance was giving him, and Keith could feel his Galra features receding as his cock rose to full attention. It was shiny with saliva and the natural lube, which was oozing down the sides, beading up at the glistening head where Lance licked it away delicately. Then he swung a leg over Keith\u2019s hips.\nKeith opened his eyes fully. He wasn\u2019t going to miss seeing Lance sit on his cock. \u201cOkay,\u201d Lance said, biting his lip and positioning himself. Keith didn\u2019t move a muscle, except to arch an eyebrow and rake his gaze down Lance\u2019s body. Lance\u2019s dick was red and wet, bobbing against his belly as he shuffled forward and, guiding the tip of Keith\u2019s cock back to his hole, sank down on it. \nLance was so loose and slick that Keith\u2019s cock was practically sucked in, and Lance moaned like it was the best thing he\u2019d ever felt, rising up on his knees and back down again, one hand braced on Keith\u2019s thigh and the other tight on his own cock. Keith gazed at him, more than a little stunned, especially when Lance started to move his hips, undulating sinfully on Keith\u2019s cock like he was putting on a show, eyes hooded as he looked down at Keith, lips parted invitingly. His lithe body was shining with sweat and splattered with come, drying on his stomach and wet between his legs. \nLance\u2019s gaze was unfocused and dark, his movements beginning to stutter as he neared his peak, breaths coming out in sharp staccato ah\u2019s.\nKeith slid a hand up Lance\u2019s side and Lance\u2019s skin broke out in goose bumps where he touched him. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he urged.\nBut Lance resisted, shaking his head and bearing down on Keith\u2019s cock insistently. \u201cKnot me,\u201d he said, red-faced. \u201cI wanna feel you.\u201d\nYou\u2019re going to feel me tomorrow, Keith thought with a hint of guilt. But it wasn\u2019t enough guilt to refuse that offer, and besides \u2013 the thought of Lance not being able to sit down for the next week without thinking of him was very, very satisfying.\n\u201cUp,\u201d Keith ordered, and Lance lifted, Keith\u2019s cock sliding out of him wetly, throbbing to the point of pain. Lance thumbed the knot and Keith swore, exhaustion forgotten in favor of claiming him again. Keith sat up and Lance fell backwards, confused. \u201cOver,\u201d Keith barked, pushing at Lance\u2019s back, \u201cturn over, on your stomach \u2013\u201d\nLance moaned in understanding and scrambled onto his hands and knees facing the end of the bed, and Keith was derailed by the sight of Lance\u2019s ass right there, and yeah, maybe it wasn\u2019t much to look at when he was standing, but like this? Fuck. And then Lance widened his legs just enough for Keith to see his hole between his cheeks, pink and puffy like his mouth and overflowing with come. Keith had never had the desire to lick anyone\u2019s asshole before, for obvious reasons, but he was struck by it then, and could not stop himself from spreading Lance\u2019s cheeks and dragging his tongue over it, wrenching a shout from the Blue Paladin\u2019s throat. He did it again, and again, cock hanging heavy between his legs as Lance\u2019s voice broke on another cry, and all Keith could think was mine, mine, mine.\nThe same mantra pounded through his head as he pounded into Lance one last time, and the second his knot entered they were both gone. Lance came explosively over his own knuckles and Keith fucked him through it, teeth finding the nape of Lance\u2019s neck and holding him in place, listening to Lance\u2019s little whimpers and moans with pride. \u201cGood boy,\u201d he said again, purred into Lance\u2019s ear, and Lance absolutely collapsed under him, a boneless mess on the bed. \nWhen Keith came back to himself he was curled securely around Lance, spooning him while still buried inside. Lance snuggled back against him, a content little smile on his face, eyes closed. Keith closed his eyes too, the wave of fatigue catching up to him all at once, and he barely managed to pull the sheets over them before falling (or rather, crashing) asleep. \n*\nKeith woke up hours later, disoriented and warm and very, very sore. Oh, and with Lance sleeping half on him, naked, and drooling all over his chest. When he saw Lance, the panic started to set in as the events of earlier came tumbling back to him.\nLance was\u2026a mess, really, there was no other word for it. His hair was a bird\u2019s nest, sticking up every which way. He had dried blood smeared across his lips and chin, and various other bodily fluids all over the rest of him, interspersed by occasional bruises and scratches which Keith didn\u2019t even remember making. Keith couldn\u2019t even bring himself to look at where Lance was the messiest. \nOh, this was bad. This was so bad. \nHe tried to extricate himself slowly so as not to disturb Lance, but the moment he moved away, Lance snuffled sleepily and made grabby hands for him, eyes blinking open blearily. \u201cWhere\u2019re you goin\u2019?\u201d he slurred, throwing a lanky arm over Keith\u2019s waist. \nKeith forced his mouth into what he hoped was close to a smile while edging away. \u201cI was just\u2026going to get a bath started. You must be, um. Pretty sore.\u201d\nLance blinked, brow furrowing. He started to sit up. \u201cI\u2019m totally fi \u2013 fuck.\u201d His face screwed up in discomfort and Keith stumbled off the bed and away, guilt twisting in his throat like a live thing, choking him with panic and shame. Lance lay back down gingerly, oblivious to Keith\u2019s horror. \u201cA bath sounds awesome,\u201d he mumbled. \n\u201cRight, then, I\u2019ll go do that,\u201d Keith said in one breath, and high-tailed it to the bathroom, grabbing his pants on the way. The door shut with a click and Keith yanked on the pants and put his head in his hands, heart pounding. Lance. Of all people, it had to be gangly, annoying, immature, straight, virginal, Lance who got caught in the crossfire of his freaky alien sex drive. Keith leaned against the wall, cursing Velline, cursing Lance, cursing his dick, cursing himself for letting this happen. \nHe\u2019d never really liked the idea of \u2018taking someone\u2019s virginity\u2019; it was a stupid societal construct, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that he had taken Lance\u2019s, in one fell swoop, and Lance had been barely lucid for most of it. \nHell, he wasn\u2019t even sure Lance had consented! He could\u2019ve been drugged on crazy Galra juju long before getting a taste of the damn strawberry flavored pre-cum, which was, Keith realized in hindsight, probably laced with the Galra version of ketamine. It made sense, in a twisted kind of way \u2013 Galras had evolved with the desire to have willing partners, able to keep up with their heat-induced libido\u2026\n\u201cDid you fall in?\u201d Lance called from the bedroom. Keith started, remembering he was supposed to be turning on the water. \n\u201cNo, just, um, a problem with the pipes, but it\u2019s working now!\u201d\n\u201cGreat, because I have a problem with my pipes if you know what I mean, so hurry it up, bat boy!\u201d\nKeith winced and turned on the spigot so forcefully he almost broke it. Luckily the pipes were fine, and the bathtub began to fill quickly with water. It was made of a pale green stone, and was large enough for two \u2013\nFurious with himself, Keith pushed the thought away. Two weeks, Velline had said. Two weeks of this torture. The need to fuck everything in sight was gone, and that was a relief, but his mind still went all fuzzy and peaceful when he thought of Lance. Right before he was filled with all-consuming guilt, anyway. Keith resisted hitting his head against the wall and poured in a bottle of what he hoped was soap. The water turned blue and bubbly, and when Keith stuck his finger in it was warm and didn\u2019t make his skin fall off, so he figured it was fine. \nHe went back out to Lance, who looked like he\u2019d tried to get out of bed and failed. He was lying on the floor, limbs splayed awkwardly. It was terribly endearing. Keith bit his tongue. \u201cCan you stand?\u201d he asked, not wanting to get any closer than necessary. He\u2019d done enough damage.\nLance huffed, glaring half-heartedly at him. \u201c\u2019Course I can, don\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d he snapped, scrabbling for the edge of the bed and hefting himself unsteadily onto his feet. He swayed, legs wobbling, and Keith was forced to grab his arm before he toppled over, his skin crawling everywhere they touched. Lance slumped into him gratefully, knees wobbly, tripping over his own feet like an adorable baby deer or something. \nKeith bit his tongue again. Stop.\nThey managed to make it to the bathtub in one piece, and as soon as Lance saw the steamy water he moaned. \u201cFuccckkk, this was such a good idea, Keith, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d Ignoring how Lance\u2019s dramatic sounds of pleasure made his dick react totally inappropriately, Keith all but pushed him into the bath and turned on his heel, making a beeline for the door.\nLance caught his wrist. Heart in his throat, Keith glanced back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026not getting in with me?\u201d Lance asked, brow creasing. \nQuiznak, was he still drugged? Keith frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll take a bath later,\u201d he replied, strained. \u201cRight now, I just. Need to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lance said in a small voice. \u201cOkay, cool. Um. Thanks for letting me use your bathtub.\u201d\nKeith wanted to be anywhere but here. \u201cYeah. Sure. Lock the door on your way out, alright?\u201d\n\u201cOn my way\u2026\u201d Lance\u2019s expression shifted, unmistakably, to hurt. \u201cOh. Got it.\u201d He tried for a smile, but it didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. \u201cI really tired you out, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Keith said, clipped, not looking at him. \u201cEnjoy your bath.\u201d\n\u201cSleep tight, bat boy.\u201d\nKeith shut the door.\n*\nKeith did sleep, but it was fitful and unpleasant and he awoke with a start when Lance left the room, his chest feeling hollow, as if something had been torn from it. He slept even worse after that, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to get out of bed and face Lance again, so he suffered through the feverish dreams and the ache in his chest until the sunlight streaming in was gone and the room was dark.\nEven then he lingered in the bed, the utterly filthy bed which reeked of sex, but also reeked of Lance, and that was why he delayed the inevitable removal of the ruined, stained sheets. Keith knew it was creepy and pathetic but he clung to that single remnant of Lance for as long as he could, inhaling his now-familiar scent until he finally got a grip and practically leapt out of bed, ripping the sheets off angrily, realizing too late that his claws had decided to join the pity party and the sheets were now extra-ruined. \nKeith stood there in the middle of the tangled mound of sheets. He couldn\u2019t stay in here forever, or he might actually go mad. No. He needed to\u2026to talk to someone.\n\nHe needed to talk to Shiro.\n*\nBy the time he\u2019d bathed and made himself look presentable (read: like he hadn\u2019t just had an entire day of sex), it was late. Later than Keith had previously thought, judging by the entirely empty dining room and training area. He still snuck around, peeking around corners cautiously, fully prepared to bolt at the slightest whiff of Lance, but it seemed everyone had retired for the night. Everyone except for several Sylphe couples in various states of undress who had decided to take advantage of the empty halls, and did nothing to quell the itch under Keith\u2019s skin as he stalked past them, receiving more than a few wide-eyed stares. \nShiro\u2019s room was, of fucking course, the farthest away from his own, and by the time he reached it his muscles were very unhappy with him. Marathon sex had a plethora of unfortunate consequences, apparently. He took a moment to compose himself as best he could before knocking on Shiro\u2019s door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Keith,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh! Come in,\u201d Shiro called, sounding cheerful and therefore unaware of why Keith had ditched him at breakfast. Well\u2026at least that meant the Empress was keeping it under wraps. Small mercies. \nKeith opened the door, standing awkwardly on the threshold as it closed behind him. Shiro had gotten ahold of a punching bag, somehow, and was making full use of it, pausing briefly when he saw Keith. \u201cHey, good to see you,\u201d Shiro said warmly, settling into another fighting stance. \u201cEmpress Velline said you got really sick this morning, but it looks like you\u2019re better now, huh? I told her you were a tough kid.\u201d \n\u201cShiro, I fucked up,\u201d Keith blurted, wringing his hands. \nShiro paused mid-punch, shooting him a quizzical look. \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d Keith whispered, \u201cI think I accidentally roofied Lance. With my dick.\u201d\nShiro stopped punching, and folded his arms, brow lowering. \u201cKeith\u2026\u201d\nAnd then the whole story was spilling from Keith\u2019s lips, minus many, many details that Shiro did not ever, ever need to know. Once he\u2019d started talking he couldn\u2019t stop, and by the time he was finished he was drained and humiliated and couldn\u2019t look Shiro in the eye. He was also ninety percent sure he\u2019d grown a pair of Galra ears and several purple splotches over the course of the explanation, which probably wasn\u2019t winning him any Shiro-points. \nKeith hated looking like a Galra in front of Shiro \u2013 it was common knowledge that Shiro had been held prisoner by the Galras. Shiro was scarred for life from the trials and experiments they\u2019d forced him to endure, both mentally and physically, and Keith knew that it was hard for Shiro to see a friend wearing the face of those who had hurt him. \nBut Shiro didn\u2019t sound angry when he said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\nKeith glanced up, taken aback. \u201cDid\u2026did you even listen to what I said? I \u2013\u201d\nShiro cut him off gently. \u201cKeith, I heard you. You regret what you did. You wouldn\u2019t have done it if you were in your right mind. Correct?\u201d\nKeith hunched his shoulders. \u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t have! But I did it, and \u2013\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d Shiro sighed, and went to the small sofa in the room. Keith followed numbly, sitting next to him and stiffening when Shiro touched his shoulder. \u201cKeith, you\u2019re always beating yourself up. You know that? And sometimes that\u2019s a good thing, like in training, when in helps you improve. But you can\u2019t beat yourself up over this.\u201d\n\u201cShiro, I hurt him,\u201d Keith whispered miserably. \u201cI \u2013 I could have locked myself in my room, or gotten someone to tie me up, or\u2026or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have worked,\u201d Shiro said quietly. Keith looked up at the seriousness in his tone. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t remember everything from my\u2026time with the Galras. But I do remember when a Galra soldier went into heat, once.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cEven the other Galras were afraid of him \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what was happening then, but I think he went into that blood fever state the Empress described to you. He had tried to resist it, and it drove him to insanity. He was out of control, and the other soldiers fought back but the prisoners were tied up, easy prey\u2026\u201d\nKeith tensed, horrified. \u201cShiro \u2013 did he \u2013 did you \u2013\u201d\nShiro squeezed his shoulder. \u201cNo, they sedated him long before he got to me. But before that\u2026he got to at least three people, maybe more. I don\u2019t even remember most of it, but there was a lot of screaming, a lot of blood. He killed two of them. I think the Galras had the soldier disposed of after that, because I never saw him again.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Keith said, not knowing what else to possibly say.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s \u2013\u201d Shiro sighed again, heavily. \u201cListen, Keith. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that it may not seem like it but I think you did the right thing.\u201d Keith stared at him, incredulous. \u201cOr, okay, the best thing possible given the situation,\u201d Shiro amended. \u201cThe Galra at least had the advantage of knowing what was going on. You didn\u2019t. And yet you still managed to do a far better job of dealing with it.\u201d\n\u201cBut I \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDid you go into the blood fever state?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDid you force yourself on a random stranger without explanation?\u201d\n\u201cNo, just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDid you kill Lance?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d\n\u201cDid you permanently maim him?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t think so \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDid he ever tell you to stop?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2026no. But he was drugged \u2013\u201d\nShiro raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cWas he drugged when you first kissed him and told him what was happening?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Keith muttered. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t even know what he was agreeing to. And\u2026and maybe he was still influenced by me somehow, I don\u2019t know how this Galra thing works!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it works like that,\u201d Shiro said dryly. \u201cFor example, I was sitting next to you at breakfast and I can assure you I didn\u2019t feel at all influenced by you. I was concerned that you were going to break your fork in half, yes, but I wasn\u2019t swooning into your arms.\u201d\nKeith made a face. \u201cShiro, I think your willpower against swooning is a bit stronger than Lance\u2019s.\u201d\nShiro took a deep breath, and looked as if he was trying to muster up the last of his patience. \u201cAlright. If you really think that you wrongfully coerced Lance into this, the only way to know the truth is to talk to him, Keith.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that,\u201d Keith said, pained. \nShiro gave him a hard look. \u201cTake your time if you need to, but remember that we can\u2019t let anything come between the team that\u2019ll affect Voltron. And you shouldn\u2019t let this come between you two anyway \u2013 especially if you\u2019re wrong, and it was actually great bonding time.\u201d\n\u201cBonding time,\u201d Keith repeated flatly. \n\u201cI know I\u2019m not the only one who would be thrilled to see you getting along with Lance for once,\u201d Shiro pointed out. \u201cBesides\u2026I don\u2019t think Galra heat is a one-time thing. Maybe next time he can \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Keith said. \u201cNo, Shiro, you were supposed to help, not encourage my bad decisions!\u201d\nShiro shook his head fondly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad decision, Keith. I\u2019m happy for you. Lance really looks up to you, you know. He \u2013\u201d\n\u201cProbably hates me now, if he didn\u2019t already!\u201d Keith finished, getting up from the couch and stomping away from him, agitated.\n\u201cI highly doubt he hates you \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe should!\u201d Keith snapped. \nShiro pressed his fingers into his temple and prayed for strength. \u201cKeith. Talk to him,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cOr I will personally lock you both in a closet for an extended period of time until you make nice.\u201d\nKeith threw up his hands and left the room. Shiro could damn well try, but Keith wasn\u2019t going to get close enough to Lance for any closet-locking, much less talking, to happen.\n*\nIf Keith had thought the first day of heat was difficult, the rest of the first week was absolute torture. It was a different kind of torture \u2013 though his cock remained Galra-esque and he had plenty of wet dreams, he didn\u2019t really jerk off more than usual and he didn\u2019t stay hard for hours on end. No, the problem was that he was physically in pain, and at first he thought it was just sore muscles but as the days passed it became apparent that it was a different kind of ache. A lonely kind of ache. And his mind had decided, against Keith\u2019s will, that Lance was the one to fill that ache.\nKeith had never been in a relationship, so he had no experience with post-breakup depression, but that was the only thing he could think of that even came close to describing his misery. He lay awake at night unable to think of anything except Lance, and not even necessarily in a sexual way, just\u2026the way he laughed, the brightness of his eyes, the sound of his voice, the expression on his face when Keith had basically told him to get lost. He wanted to go back and beg Lance to stay, to climb into that bathtub with him and just hold him, to never ever let go\u2026\nYeah, it was fucked up. And it just got worse when he saw Lance in person \u2013 try as he might Keith couldn\u2019t sequester himself in his room all day, and so he avoided Lance like the plague instead. This meant avoiding most of the team too, except Pidge, who was usually off doing something on their own anyway. \nMealtimes were the worst. Keith could sense Shiro\u2019s disapproval as he sullenly picked at his plate, focusing on the smell of the food and not the smell of Lance, halfway down the table. Maybe Shiro had talked to Allura, too, because the princess actually pulled him aside one night to give him a talk about teamwork and communication. Keith barely paid attention because the whole time he could feel Lance\u2019s gaze on him, cold and accusatory.\nSo Keith spent most of the day in the training area, fighting out his frustrations, sweating and stabbing and punching until exertion outweighed longing and he was tired enough to fall onto his (new) sheets and sleep deeply enough that he might not even remember the excruciating dreams. After five days of that he started to get too tired and achy to feasibly train for so long, and changed his path to the kitchens where he could drown his sorrows in food. That was what Pidge always did, during certain times of the month, and it did sort of work, temporarily. \nKeith just wished they had chocolate on Everren. The weirdly sweet black cubes he found in the icebox were not doing it for him. \nThat was how Hunk found him on the sixth day, sitting on an isolated bench and chewing on substitute chocolate forlornly, Galra ears drooping. \n\u201cHey!\u201d Hunk said, and it sounded like he was trying to be intimidating, but wasn\u2019t really putting his heart into it.\nKeith swallowed and set down his bowl of cubes. \u201cWhat,\u201d he said, even though he already knew. Hunk was Lance\u2019s best friend, and if Hunk was the type for violence, Keith would be preparing to get his ass kicked. As it was, he prepared for a verbal ass kicking instead, one which he fully deserved.\nBut instead Hunk wavered, and said, \u201cLance is really messed up.\u201d \nKeith blinked and looked up, dropping his cube. \u201cHe\u2026what?\u201d A million nightmarish scenarios flickered through his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\nHunk wrung his hands frantically. \u201cHe won\u2019t eat because he gets sick and he barely sleeps and he has these constant migraines and he seems like he has heartburn all the time and never wants to get out of bed and I think he\u2019s dying, and he won\u2019t tell me what happened but he said it had to do with you!\u201d Hunk looked at him, genuinely terrified. \u201cDid you poison Lance?!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Keith objected, because if he was going to get called out it should at least be for the right offense. \nKeith thought Hunk might burst into tears at any moment. \u201cThen what did you do?! Because whatever it was, I think you broke him! He hasn\u2019t made a bad pun for days and doesn\u2019t even try to flirt with Allura or the Sylphe maids anymore.\u201d\nSomething possessive bubbled up in Keith at that; he shoved it down. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s like that,\u201d Keith answered honestly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2026\u201d He hesitated, debating the pros and cons of telling Hunk. Lance hadn\u2019t told him, and Lance told him everything. Besides\u2026Hunk might actually die of mortification. So he settled on, \u201cI might have accidentally hurt him, but I didn\u2019t mean to, and I know that doesn\u2019t make it right but I am sorry, and I understand if he\u2026hates me.\u201d\nHunk\u2019s face unexpectedly split into a grin. \u201cI knew you cared! I told Lance I was going to talk to you and he said you wouldn\u2019t care but you do.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s chest constricted. \u201cHe\u2026he thinks I don\u2019t care? About him?\u201d\nHunk nodded solemnly. \u201cListen, uh \u2013 Lance would kill me if he knew I told you this, but\u2026he cares about you. Like, a lot. Like he\u2019s been majorly crushing on you ever since you took on Zarkon.\u201d Hunk exhaled as if a weight had been taken off his chest. \u201cWhew, there, finally said it!\u201d\nOh, no. Keith blanched. \u201cLance has a crush on me?!\u201d\n\u201cShh, shh, not so loud!\u201d Hunk cautioned, though the only life forms that could possibly overhear them were some four-eyed monkeys in the neighboring tree. \n\u201cBut he\u2019s \u2013 I thought he only liked \u2013\u201d\n\u201cGirls?\u201d Hunk cleared his throat. \u201cI mean, yeah, he does, but he also likes you. Congrats?\u201d\nKeith did not know what to do with this news. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said simply. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Hunk said, offended for Lance. \u201cYou could do way worse!\u201d\nHunk, sadly, did not understand the gravity of the situation. Keith stood up. \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease tell Lance I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just tell him yourself?\u201d Hunk asked, confused. Keith started walking away. \u201cKeith! Where are you going?!\u201d\n\u201cTo figure this out,\u201d Keith muttered, and started towards the royal wing of the palace. \n*\nLance liked him.\nKeith still couldn\u2019t believe it, and yet the more he thought about it, the more it unfortunately started to make sense \u2013 it would explain Lance\u2019s weird rivalry obsession, anyway. And that just made him feel about ten times worse. Because\u2026meaningless sex was one thing, but sex with someone who had feelings for him? And not just any sex but intense alien-heat-fueled-sex, and it had been Lance\u2019s first time, and Keith had knotted him in the ass twice and called him a good boy, and Lance had a crush on him the whole time.\nOf course that crush had probably gone up in smoke by now, Keith thought bitterly, now that Lance knew what a shitty person he was.\nThe royal wing was bigger than Keith had expected, but he followed the faint traces of Empress Velline\u2019s scent as best he could, cloying perfume muddling the air. The halls were more spacious and extravagantly decorated here, lined with strange plants and colorful birdlike creatures in gilded cages. They chattered at Keith as he passed, and covered the sound of footsteps approaching him from behind until the new scent made him whirl around to face the stranger.\nKeith stared. Standing a few paces from him was another half-Galra, an adult female with Sylphaen features instead of human ones. She blinked at him with luminous hazel eyes, curls of frizzy violet hair nearly covering her large Galra ears. Her skin was dark, speckled with a lighter purple, and she wore Sylphaen clothing almost as fine as the Empress\u2019s, her neck laden with necklaces strung with bright jewels. She looked\u2026she looked like royalty.\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, voice lilting, \u201cit\u2019s you. The stubborn one.\u201d \nKeith eyed her warily. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Silese,\u201d she replied. \u201cI am the Empress\u2019s eldest daughter.\u201d\nKeith gaped at her, comprehension dawning on him. \u201cThen \u2013 your father was \u2013\u201d\n\u201cA full-blooded Galra whom she helped through his heat. Yes.\u201d Silese frowned at him. \u201cAs she offered to help you, yet you refused. My mother said you mated one of the other paladins instead, which is an interesting choice \u2013\u201d\nKeith paused. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201chold up \u2013 mated?\u201d\nSilese raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am assuming you knotted him? In which case, he is your mate now. You are bonded for life.\u201d At Keith\u2019s bewildered and distressed expression she blinked, nonplussed. \u201cIt should not be so surprising\u2026surely you have felt the bond when he is near.\u201d\n\u201cHe \u2013 we haven\u2019t spoken since \u2013\u201d\nShe looked alarmed. \u201cYou mated him and abandoned him?! That is cruel to the both of you \u2013 haven\u2019t you felt the agony of his absence? I am certain he has, and will continue to do so until you go to him.\u201d\nKeith was sweating. \u201cHow do I un-mate him?\u201d he pleaded. \n\u201cYou do not,\u201d Silese snapped. \u201cThere is no such thing! Galras mate for life, and during each heat only a Galra\u2019s mate can satisfy them. You may take on another mate, but it will not un-mate the first one \u2013\u201d\n\u201cBut I made a mistake!\u201d Keith wailed. \u201cLance can\u2019t be my mate; he hates me!\u201d\nSilese glared at him. \u201cWhat did you do to him?!\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 I drugged him, with that\u2026\u201d He flushed. \u201cThe strawberry thing. He couldn\u2019t even consent...\u201d\nSilese\u2019s anger faded. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, paladin, the serek is not a drug. It does act as a stimulator to relax your partner and increase their stamina, but it does not take away free will.\u201d She looked at him with pity. \u201cYour mate does not hate you, paladin, but he might if you continue to let him suffer.\u201d\n\u201cQuiznak,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d\nSilese rolled her eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do.\u201d\n*\nKeith half-ran back to the guest wing, not sure whether he was feeling elation or panic or a mixture of both. On the one hand \u2013 hooray for consent! On the other hand \u2013 fuck, accidental mating for life, with Lance.\nBut maybe\u2026maybe that wasn\u2019t so bad? Maybe Lance wasn\u2019t so bad. Hunk was right \u2013 he could do way worse.\nKeith was jolted out of his thoughts by a full-on collision with none other than Lance Espinosa himself.\n\u201cOw \u2013\u201d Lance rubbed his jaw ruefully and then saw who he\u2019d just walked into, eyes widening, then narrowing. \u201cOh,\u201d he sneered, \u201cit\u2019s you. Did a top-notch job of avoiding me up until now, you jerk!\u201d\n\u201cLance \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t you Lance me,\u201d Lance snarled, and this time Keith was the one getting backed up against the wall, on the defensive. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to \u2013 to pretend that nothing happened, that you didn\u2019t rock my damn world and then throw me away to go find someone else to \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find anyone else!\u201d Keith exclaimed. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s nobody else, what, you think I just fuck anyone who gets close enough?!\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that exactly what you did with me?\u201d Lance retorted, and Keith flinched. Lance sighed, deflating a little. \u201cI know you couldn\u2019t\u2026stop yourself. It was just \u2013 I was there, and you needed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI thought I drugged you,\u201d Keith blurted. \u201cThat the Galra shit was\u2026was messing with your head and making you think that you wanted it when really \u2013\u201d\nLance flushed. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t want it?!\u201d He flailed his hands around. \u201cDude! I came six times!\u201d\nKeith turned even redder. \u201cI thought you hated me!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lance cried. \u201cI think I\u2019m gay for you!\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Keith said. \u201cYeah, Hunk just\u2026told me that.\u201d\nLance yelped indignantly. \u201cHe did what?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Keith said. \u201cLance, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2026and it was your first time, and it was too much, and \u2013\u201d\nLance stared at him incredulously. \u201cWhy are you apologizing for the sex?!\u201d he said way too loudly. \u201cThe sex was fantastic! What you should be apologizing for is making me feel like shit for the past week because for some reason it literally hurts to stay away from you! How clich\u00e9 is that?\u201d\nKeith winced. \u201cRight, sorry, uh, about that\u2026I accidentally made you my mate? For life?\u201d\nLance, for once, was speechless. \u201cHow\u2026\u201d Then he blanched. \u201cThe knotting.\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Keith said miserably. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I swear, if I knew I never would have done it!\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Lance muttered. \u201cNever, huh? Jeez, Keith, tell me how you really feel.\u201d\nKeith looked at him, startled. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026not mad?\u201d\n\u201cShit, man, I don\u2019t know, are you gonna continue ignoring me until I die of rejection?\u201d\nKeith felt, suddenly, like he was going to burst into tears. He looked down. \u201cI never meant to hurt you,\u201d he said, voice wobbling.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lance said. \u201cHey, no, wait, please don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t ever know what to do when people cry.\u201d He reached out, uncertain, and put a hand on Keith\u2019s shoulder. The contact made them both shudder, and Keith sniffled, still hiding his face. \n\u201cI hate this, y\u2019know,\u201d Keith mumbled. \u201cBeing half-Galra, I mean. Not knowing what\u2019s going on with my own body, not being able to trust myself even around my friends, not knowing whose life I\u2019m going to fuck up next \u2013\u201d\nLance shuffled closer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fuck up anyone\u2019s life, Keith,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd\u2026and between you and me, I think the half-Galra thing is kind of cool.\u201d\nKeith sniffled again, unconvinced. \u201cBut I could have seriously injured \u2013\u201d\nLance touched his face and Keith shivered, glancing up. Lance offered him a little smile. \u201cListen, that heat thing\u2026it was like you were following your instincts, right? Like, you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from giving in to your deepest darkest desires or whatever?\u201d\nKeith chewed his lip. \u201cI\u2026I guess so, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if that was you at your most uninhibited, then you\u2019ve got nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Lance told him. \u201cI mean, yeah, maybe you\u2019re a little bossy and rough but you\u2019re not a bad guy, Keith. You\u2019re right \u2013 you could\u2019ve ripped me apart with your bare hands, easy. But you didn\u2019t. There was never a point where I was\u2026where I was afraid of you.\u201d\nKeith searched his gaze for a hint of mockery; there was none. \u201cEven when I went full-Galra on you?\u201d\nLance shrugged. \u201cEven then. Like I said\u2026I think it\u2019s kinda cool.\u201d He flicked one of Keith\u2019s ears fondly. \u201cBat boy.\u201d\nKeith smiled despite himself. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou should probably be running away screaming right now.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to run away from you anymore,\u201d Lance said, and then his arms were around Keith and although Keith had never really had a home to go back to, he imagined this was what it would feel like. He hesitantly hugged Lance back, tucking his face against his shoulder and breathing him in. There was a new sweetness to his scent. Happiness. Lance was\u2026happy. Here, in Keith\u2019s arms, he was happy. Keith held him a little tighter. \u201cDon\u2019t run away again,\u201d Lance whispered into his hair. \n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Keith said. He didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cWhen\u2026when Hunk talked to me, he said you\u2026thought I didn\u2019t care about you.\u201d Lance was quiet. Keith could feel his heart pounding. He pulled back, and held Lance\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cLance, I care about you.\u201d\nLance flushed, eyes wide. \u201cAww,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re gay for me too?\u201d\nKeith let go of his face, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnd the moment is ruined.\u201d\nLance grinned. \u201cYou are! I knew it!\u201d\n\u201cLance, I\u2019m not gay for you, I\u2019m just gay in general \u2013 mm.\u201d\nLance kissed him soundly, lips as soft as Keith remembered them, bodies tangled in glorious union. He tugged Lance closer and Lance went easily, willingly, and Keith could feel Lance\u2019s smile against his own. He felt warm and tingly all over and this time, he was pretty sure it didn\u2019t have anything to do with alien heat cycles. \nThey were reluctant to separate \u2013 even when the kiss ended they stayed together, chest to chest, Lance\u2019s breath feathering across Keith\u2019s lips as he murmured, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to think of anything but you. I thought something was wrong with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Keith said, guilty all over again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you, either.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m irresistible,\u201d Lance smirked, then he saw the sorrow in Keith\u2019s face and made a soft sound. \u201cHey. Don\u2019t go all sad and broody on me, okay? We\u2019re gonna figure this out, bat boy. You and me. We\u2019re a team, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyes felt wet again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYeah, we are.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Lance snorted. \u201cOr not.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWait\u2026if I\u2019m your Galra mate, does that mean I can\u2019t win over Allura\u2019s heart anymore?\u201d\nKeith raised an eyebrow. \u201cShiro got there way before you did, Lance.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lance gasped. \u201cShiro and the Princess?!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not official, so don\u2019t go blabbing about it,\u201d Keith warned.\nLance huffed, offended. \u201cI would never!\u201d He was quiet for a little while, and his hand on Keith\u2019s chest curled slightly. \u201cUm\u2026are we official?\u201d\nKeith eyed him. \u201cOfficial? What, do you want matching T-shirts that say \u2018Mates for Life\u2019?\u201d\nLance punched his arm. \u201cNo, you asshole. Like\u2026are we just going to have a thing when you\u2019re in heat or are we going to have a thing-thing?\u201d\nKeith furrowed his brow. \u201cWhat is a thing-thing?\u201d\nLance glared at him. \u201cDo you want to be my boyfriend or not?!\u201d\nKeith blinked. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Oh\u2019?\u201d Lance echoed, stepping back. \u201cSo, so you just want me for my body, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Keith said. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve just. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend.\u201d\nLance looked at him suspiciously. \u201cNever? Oh, c\u2019mon, you\u2019ve totally been with people before \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve hooked up, yeah, but I\u2019ve never dated,\u201d Keith said, uncomfortable. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that! There was just never \u2013 I never wanted to, and nobody was really leaping at the chance to date the weird orphan kid.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lance said after a beat, \u201cI want to. Date me.\u201d\nKeith felt off-balance, and strangely giddy. \u201cI think you\u2019re being influenced by the mate thing,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not in your right mind, there could be alien hormones in the air, maybe my saliva is drugged \u2013\u201d\n\u201cKeith. I like you, and I want to date you. I want to get you flowers or chocolate or something sappy like that, and go out with you to see a space movie and fly around the galaxy in our Lions together. And, yeah, when my ass has fully recovered I\u2019m so down with whatever you wanna do to it. And maybe I can do stuff to yours too. The possibilities are endless.\u201d Lance was serious. He was serious, he wanted this, and Keith was breathless just looking at him, imagining it. A thing-thing. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Keith said. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026let\u2019s date.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Lance said, eyes lighting up. \u201cReally?\u201d\nKeith nodded, shy. \u201cI like you too.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, you better, you licked my \u2013\u201d\nKissing Lance into silence was never going to get old.\nWhen the kiss ended they were both giggling, and it was ridiculous, but Keith loved it. Lance pet his ears, and Keith didn\u2019t even try to stop him. \u201cI have a proposal for our first date,\u201d Lance said. Keith tilted his head. \u201cSleeping for as long as possible before Shiro and Allura haul our asses out of bed. Deal?\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Keith agreed happily. \nMine, he thought as Lance took his hand. Mine."
