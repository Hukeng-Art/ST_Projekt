    "text": "The first time it happened, Harry thought he\u2019d finally gone mad.\nIt wasn\u2019t going mad that he found surprising \u2013 several of the Prophet\u2019s more prolific columnists had been speculating on that fact for years, after all \u2013 rather, it was more the timing of it that flummoxed him. After all, no one would have blamed him if he\u2019d completely lost it during The War, when he\u2019d had Voldemort in his head and his friends dying all around him. Or if he\u2019d gone off the deep end during his Auror training, because looking back, jumping right into chasing down the remaining Death Eaters instead of taking a well-deserved break from being the Savior was a little mental in of itself. The papers had all assumed that he\u2019d finally gone round the twist when he quit the Aurors just eleven months later and disappeared for two years to travel the world. Personally, Harry had thought that his long-overdue break from sanity would have happened after he got back to England and moved into Grimmauld Place by himself and suddenly faced long empty days filled with nothing.\nBut instead of pushing him over the edge, he\u2019d settled quite comfortably into a routine, and so what if that routine seemed more suited to a Wizard at the end of his years rather than a hale twenty-three-year-old with his whole life ahead of him? Harry didn\u2019t mind at all; in fact, he welcomed the comfort of his routine. Mornings he spent doing some much-needed updating around the house or puttering about the garden, weather permitting. Then a modest lunch alone, unless it was Tuesday, when he met Ron for fish and chips, or Thursday when he popped round to the Ministry to join Hermione for sandwiches. Sundays, of course, he spent at the Burrow. A few times a month he traveled to Hogwarts to deliver a guest lecture to the NEWT level Defense Against the Dark Arts class.\nWhen he\u2019d first come back to England Harry had expected to be bored out of his skull, but he wasn\u2019t. It took him a few months for it to really sink in, but for the first time in his life, he was really truly honestly at peace.\nWhich made it all the more baffling why he\u2019d gone off his trolley now when, for the first time in his life, he had no reason to.\nIt was just half-three, which meant it was time to spend the height of the afternoon sitting in the front parlor with a cup of tea and a few Quidditch magazines. But when Harry had walked into the room, he\u2019d found himself already there.\nHe tried blinking rapidly. He tried giving himself a pinch. He tried squeezing his eyes shut and counting to ten and telling himself that when he opened his eyes again, the other Harry would be gone.\nIt hadn\u2019t worked.\nAt somewhat of a loss for what to do next, Harry just stared. And stared. And took a sip of his tea. And stared some more.\nThe other Harry was still there, leafing idly through a Quidditch magazine and drinking his own tea from Harry\u2019s favorite blue mug. He was sitting in Harry\u2019s favorite chair, and had his feet propped up on the corner of the coffee table, exactly as Harry had planned to do because it was just what he did every afternoon at teatime. He was even wearing the faded green Holyhead Harpies t-shirt that Harry was certain he\u2019d thrown into the hamper last weekend after he\u2019d spilled curry down the front. Edging a bit closer, Harry could just make out the stain.\nHarry stared some more. He wasn\u2019t overly familiar with hallucinations, never having had one before, but shouldn\u2019t it have begun to fade by now? Seconds continued to tick by and still the other Harry stayed resolutely substantial.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed off, because hallucinating was one thing, but talking to his hallucination struck him as quite another. Though, did it really count if he knew he was talking to a hallucination? Could crazy people tell they\u2019d gone crazy? He made a mental note to ask Hermione about that.\nOther Harry tried to flip the page of his magazine and take a sip of tea at the same time, and ended up dribbling some down his chin.\n\u201cBugger,\u201d Other Harry muttered, and blotted at his chin with the back of one hand before he drained the last of the tea from his cup.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou can talk? Can you, um, hear me?\u201d\nOther Harry didn\u2019t reply, so Harry edged a bit closer, and then noticed for the first time the other changes around the room. There was an unfamiliar knitted afghan thrown over an arm of the sofa. An ugly blue vase Harry certainly didn\u2019t own sat on a small table near the door. The bookshelf was now crammed with row upon row of solemn-looking leatherbound books. The vase was closest, so Harry reached for that first. His fingers passed right into it, feeling remarkably like he\u2019d just plunged his hand into a bowl of cold pudding. The slimy, creepy feeling made him shiver and he pulled his hand back. The vase was still there.\nOver in the armchair, Other Harry reached for his mug and lifted it to take a sip, but found it empty. He frowned into it, then looked up toward the door, his gaze meeting Harry\u2019s.\n\u201cHey!\u201d he called. \u201cWhile you\u2019re up, can you bring me another cup of tea?\u201d\nHarry jumped. \u201cMe?\u201d\nHarry flinched again as another voice came floating up the hall.\n\u201cI\u2019m not your house elf!\u201d\nOther Harry grinned, and Harry realized then that his gaze wasn\u2019t fixed on him, but rather the door behind him. \u201cI know. You\u2019re a good deal prettier and tend to iron your ears a lot less. Two sugars, please!\u201d\n\u201cTosser!\u201d came the reply.\nStill smiling to himself, Other Harry returned his attention to the Quidditch magazine. He seemed disinclined to do anything else, so Harry thought he might as well take a look at who else he was hallucinating in his home. The voice had sounded vaguely familiar, though he couldn\u2019t quite place it. He reached for the doorknob, and again felt that cold pudding sensation, but before he could pull his hand back, the room wavered and a small pop echoed all around him.\nHarry looked back. The blue vase and its little table had disappeared from beside the door. The knitted blanket was gone from the sofa. The bookshelves were once again empty and, most importantly, Other Harry was gone from the chair.\nHarry stared for a moment, expecting him to reappear. When he didn\u2019t, Harry backed slowly out into the hall and shut the parlor door behind him.\nJust this once, he thought he\u2019d break routine and take his tea in the garden.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione, do you think that crazy people can tell if they\u2019ve gone mad?\u201d\nHarry tried to phrase the question as casually as possible, but Hermione still put down her glass of water with a slow carefulness that belied her sudden concern.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Harry, why do you ask?\u201d\nHarry shrugged a shoulder. \u201cNo reason. Just wondering,\u201d he said, suddenly changing his mind. He\u2019d walked into lunch today fully intending to tell Hermione everything about his encounter with Other Harry, but it had been three days with no reappearance, and telling her would only throw her into a frenzy of concerned research. No reason to bother her with it if the problem had solved itself.\nTheir food arrived just in time to provide a perfect distraction. Harry picked up his sandwich \u2013 roast beef with sharp cheddar cheese and a creamy horseradish sauce \u2013 and took a huge bite, then let out a little moan of pure pleasure.\n\u201cThis is so good,\u201d he and Hermione said at the same time.\nHarry blinked at her, surprised, but she only laughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so predictable these days,\u201d she teased.\nHarry swallowed his mouthful and grinned back. \u201cWell, after Dark Lords and basilisks and whatnot, I\u2019m pretty happy with predictability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most excitement I get these days is deciding what color to repaint the hallway, and I\u2019m more than fine with that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, how are the renovations going? I really ought to stop by, but I\u2019ve been so busy.\u201d A lock of hair fell into her face as she tilted her head to take a bite of her sandwich, and she pushed it aside with one thumb.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I know how it is,\u201d Harry said, waving a chip in her direction before popping it into his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s going well. Um, well enough, I suppose. I\u2019ve finally finished with the kitchen and just ripped up the carpeting in the den this morning. But I feel like no matter what I do, it doesn\u2019t change the feel of the place.\u201d\nHermione frowned. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d\nHarry leaned forward a little. This was another thing he\u2019d been meaning to ask Hermione. \u201cSo, Grimmauld Place has always been gloomy, yeah? And when I started this, I thought that a few coats of paint and a good cleaning would brighten it up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t?\u201d Hermione asked. She sipped at her water.\n\u201cYes and no. It looks brighter, but it doesn\u2019t feel any brighter. It\u2019s hard to explain. It feels like no matter what I do, the house doesn\u2019t like it. I mean, I know it\u2019s just a house and all, but\u2026 it\u2019s strange. And kind of creepy,\u201d Harry sighed. He ate another chip. \u201cMaybe when you come over you can give me a second opinion?\u201d\n\u201cHow about Saturday night?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cRon\u2019s going out with some coworkers, so I\u2019m free.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Harry said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll make us that pasta you like.\u201d He leaned forward a little and determinedly put Other Harry out of his mind entirely. \u201cNow. What\u2019s the latest Ministry gossip?\u201d\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nHarry went home that afternoon and spent an hour painting swatches of different colored paint in the hallway until the strange disapproving feel he got from the house grew too much to handle and, still undecided, he took a short walk around the neighborhood, then returned home and made his afternoon tea. He approached the front parlor cautiously, but found it empty. He settled on the sofa with his tea and magazine. It was silly, but he still hadn\u2019t worked up the nerve to sit in his chair.\nLater that afternoon, after ten minutes spent eying the swatches in the hall, followed by another short walk around the neighborhood to get rid of the itchy feel of being watched from between his shoulder blades, and an hour spent revising his notes for the next lecture he was preparing for Hogwarts, Harry returned to the parlor with a butterbeer in hand and switched on the wireless. The Harpies were playing the Wimbourne Wasps tonight, and Harry hadn\u2019t missed a single one of Ginny\u2019s games since he\u2019d come back to England.\nForty minutes into the match, he went to the kitchen to get himself another butterbeer. He was just closing the refrigerator door when the mouthwatering aroma of beef and vegetable stew he absolutely hadn\u2019t cooked wafted through the room. Harry froze, and then a loud clang from behind him startled him so badly that the bottle of butterbeer slipped from his fingers to shatter on the floor. Harry whirled around.\nOther Harry was back.\nAs Harry watched, the other him clanged his wooden spoon against the rim of the pot to dislodge a bit of mushroom that stuck to it and set it aside on the counter. He then fetched napkins and silverware and went into the dining room. Harry trailed after him, and watched as Other Harry set the table for two, humming to himself as he lit candles and fiddled with a vase of roses set in the middle of the table. On his way back to the kitchen, Other Harry paused in front of the china cabinet and used the reflection in the glass door to prod uselessly at his hair.\nIt struck Harry then: the candles, the flowers, the preening, the beef stew that took so much chopping he only made it for special occasions\u2026 His other self was getting ready for a date.\nJust then, the doorbell rang, and Other Harry broke into a grin that lit up his whole face. He hurried for the door. At a loss for what else to do, Harry followed along, then brought up short as he caught a glimpse of swirling snow through the front window. It was barely October, but it was snowing? Other Harry reached for the doorknob and the world wavered and popped again, and Harry found himself alone in the hall. When he looked out the window again, he only saw the riotous orange-gold of the aspen tree just outside.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nIt happened again on Friday night. Harry had spent the day tiptoeing around his house, flinching at every sudden sound, but Other Harry had not returned. And now, at nearly midnight, he was just emptying his bladder before bed when the sudden hiss and spatter of the shower running nearly made him miss the toilet altogether. Craning his neck over his shoulder, Harry could just make out Other Harry, dressed in the same green flannel pajamas Harry wore now, standing at the sink and brushing his teeth. But if he was there, then who was in the shower?\nHarry finished as quickly as he could, shook the last few drops from his penis and tucked it away before edging cautiously to the shower, giving Other Harry a wide berth. Ignoring the cold pudding feel of the black and white curtain which had appeared instead of the faded blue striped one he hadn\u2019t gotten around to replacing yet, Harry gently tugged the shower curtain back and caught the barest glimpse of the man within, an impression of pale skin and long limbs and a pert arse and a head foamy-white with shampoo, before the room wavered and popped and Harry was alone, the sudden silence ringing in his ears.\nBloody hell, this had to stop.\nHe was going to have to tell Hermione.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nSaturday night was the perfect time. Hermione was here, and Ron was otherwise occupied. Not that Harry didn\u2019t love Ron every bit as much as he loved Hermione, just that his two friends were better in different scenarios. Ron was the one that Harry went to when he needed a solid ear to complain into, because sometimes it was nice to have a friend that would rant right along with him about a problem instead of trying to solve it for him. Ron was the one that Harry went to for Quidditch games and the occasional late-night pint at the pub.\nHermione was apparently the one that Harry went to when he\u2019d gone round the twist.\nBut he didn\u2019t do it while Hermione helped him finish up dinner. And he didn\u2019t do it while they ate, or while they cleaned up the kitchen, or while he gave her a quick tour of the updates he\u2019d done to the house since the last time she\u2019d been over. He\u2019d been worried that she wouldn\u2019t understand what he\u2019d meant when he\u2019d talked about the house disapproving, but as he talked about his next plans for renovating, the house did seem to grow a bit dimmer around them and they quickly retreated to the brightly lit kitchen to fetch the rest of their wine.\nNow they were taking their glasses and the open bottle of pinot noir to the front parlor for a quiet evening in, and Harry thought that he should probably definitely tell her now, while she\u2019d had enough wine to soften the blow that her best friend had finally gone mad, but not enough that she\u2019d get all weird and emotional about it. He needed a calm and composed Hermione, ready to leap into researching action on his behalf and help him figure out how to fix this.\nBut as they reached the door, Harry heard the low murmur of the television set that he most definitely hadn\u2019t left on. \u2018Oh no, not again,\u2019 he just had time to think to himself before Hermione pushed the door open. Other Harry was back, sprawled on the sofa with that knitted afghan thrown over his legs and a butterbeer in one hand, staring idly at the telly as it played an ad for a Mercedes convertible driving too fast along a winding cliff side road.\nHarry hadn\u2019t even realized that Hermione had stopped until she turned back to him, her eyes wide with shock.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d she asked uncertainly and looked back to the sofa.\nThe relief that washed through Harry made him giddy. \u201cOh thank god, you can see him too.\u201d He laughed, sharp and nervous and delighted with this new reassurance of his sanity. \u201cI thought I was losing my mind.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s brows had drawn down and together, and Harry could practically see the gears cranking along in her head. \u201cThis has happened before?\u201d She noticed the blue vase by the door and reached out for it, drawing her hand back with a shudder when her fingers sank into it.\nHarry nodded. \u201cA few times. He doesn\u2019t seem to be able to see me or hear me or anything, and he\u2019ll disappear in a minute or two.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Hermione said. She went over to the bookshelves and skimmed quickly over the titles before circling the sofa to examine a magazine draped over the arm.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cLooking for clues,\u201d Hermione said. She pointed at the magazine. \u201cPotion Masters Monthly, July 2005.\u201d She looked up at Harry. \u201cTwo years in the future. Do you plan on taking up Potions? Most of the books on the shelf are potions texts as well.\u201d\nHarry shook his head. \u201cNot a chance. That must be the other bloke\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOther bloke?\u201d Hermione echoed. She\u2019d already wandered off to the table by the window and was examining a pile of Owl Post.\n\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t gotten a good look at him, but I\u2019ve heard him a few times. I think Other Harry\u2019s got a live-in.\u201d\nHermione turned back to him, her eyebrows raised nearly to her hairline. \u201cA live-in? And it\u2019s a bloke? Is there\u2026 something you\u2019d like to tell me, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d he began. He hadn\u2019t planned on coming out to his friends until he had a reason to. No boyfriend, no reason, right? But now Hermione was watching him carefully and oh god he was going to have to tell her that too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s back on!\u201d Other Harry yelled as the telly finished playing ads and returned to the football match.\n\u201cComing!\u201d the mystery bloke yelled back from farther back in the house.\nThen footsteps echoed up the hall, coming closer, closer, and then a wobble and pop and Other Harry and his football match and his mysterious live-in were gone.\nHarry sighed into the silence. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gay,\u201d he said, then added cheerfully, \u201cBut at least I\u2019m probably not crazy.\u201d He drained the rest of the wine from his glass and then gave himself a refill from the bottle before topping off Hermione\u2019s. He thought they could both use it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me everything,\u201d Hermione said. It didn\u2019t sound like a request.\n\u201cI guess we\u2019d better sit down,\u201d Harry said, and headed for the sofa before coming up short. Other Harry was making him run out of places to sit.\nHermione brushed by him and plopped herself down in the armchair, and when nothing happened he felt silly for avoiding it all week. He sat gingerly on the edge of the sofa, and told her everything. He told her about the few drunken encounters he\u2019d had with other men during his travels, told her about how afraid he\u2019d been that people would treat him differently if they found out. He told her about his fear that he\u2019d never be able to make Grimmauld Place feel like a home. And he told her about all of the episodes with Other Harry he\u2019d had. Hermione made notes as he talked about the latter, then added in her own as well.\n\u201cSo do you know what could be causing it?\u201d Harry asked hopefully. Having no secrets left made him feel pleasantly empty inside.\n\u201cNot a clue,\u201d she said, folding her paper and tucking it into a pocket. \u201cBut I have some ideas of where to start looking. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find something that\u2019ll help.\u201d\nAnd Harry believed her. Research was what Hermione did best, and she hadn\u2019t let him down yet.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nAfter Hermione left, Other Harry began showing up with alarming frequency. He was in the garden pruning the roses on Sunday morning, and then sweeping bright golden leaves off the back porch, with an old Gryffindor scarf wound round his neck. He appeared in the parlor again at teatime, but by now Harry was sort of getting used to him, so he just sat on the sofa with his own tea until Other Harry left, and then reclaimed his chair.\nOther Harry brushed his teeth and washed dishes and watched football and read magazines, appearing multiple times a day, and Harry always paused whatever he was doing to watch him do these mundane tasks, resuming his own when Other Harry vanished.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Wednesday that Harry learned anything else about the other bloke. He was painting the hall a pale barely-there yellow that he thought looked especially nice against the dark wood of the wainscoting when a sudden explosion from the basement had him whirling around so fast that pale yellow droplets flew from his brush to spatter the floor. Other Harry appeared an instant later, bursting out of the kitchen and tearing off down the hall. Harry followed, catching up just as Other Harry yanked open the basement door, releasing an acrid cloud of smoke.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he called down, waving his wand to dissipate the cloud before he stood in the narrow doorway, blocking Harry\u2019s view of the basement\n\u201cPerfectly,\u201d came the acerbic reply, accompanied by footsteps coming up the stairs. \u201cThis is exactly what I meant to do, after all. I think I\u2019ve singed my eyebrows off.\u201d\nOther Harry\u2019s shoulders slumped in evident relief. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d\nAn inelegant snort preceded the reply, \u201cTo do what, make a bigger explosion? You\u2019re crap at potions.\u201d\nOther Harry hummed, unfazed by the insult. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at cleaning things, and I assume you\u2019ll want a shower. I could join you. Make sure you get all that gunk off you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOr just get you off.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The other voice was heavy with feigned reluctance. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll let you help. I know how much you like to feel useful.\u201d\nOther Harry stepped back, grinning, and the hallway wavered and popped, but not before Harry caught a glimpse of the man coming up the stairs. And it suddenly clicked where he\u2019d heard that faintly familiar voice before, because he\u2019d know that shock of white-blond hair anywhere.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry exclaimed as he burst into her office.\nShe looked up from the pile of parchments she was sorting through and came halfway out of her seat. \u201cHarry, what\u2019s happened?\u201d\nHe flung himself down into one of her hideously uncomfortable guest chairs. \u201cDo you think that Other Harry is the future me? I mean, is what I see really going to happen?\u201d Please say no, he thought desperately, please say it won\u2019t.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hermione said carefully, resettling in her chair. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d\nHarry couldn\u2019t look at her so he stared up at the ceiling. \u201cI saw his live-in.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nHe looked at her again, to find her watching him thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to say? Just, oh?\u201d\n\u201cIt does make sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard he\u2019s just finished his Masters in Potions, so that would explain all the texts and the magazine.\u201d\n\u201cBut Hermione,\u201d Harry said, because she was talking about it like it was fine that Other Harry and Malfoy were living together. \u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, so you\u2019ve said.\u201d\nShe still didn\u2019t seem to get it, so he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy.\u201d\nHermione let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cYes, Harry, I heard you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t think you did. Because if you did hear me tell you that my possible-future self is living with Draco bloody Malfoy then I really don\u2019t think you\u2019d be this calm,\u201d Harry told her. He was starting to get worked up again because all he could think of was the understated intimacy of Harry brushing his teeth while Malfoy showered. Oh god, they were probably fucking. The thought made him feel a bit faint.\nHermione sighed again. \u201cBreathe, Harry. I\u2019m going to go get you some tea.\u201d\nBy the time she had returned with the promised cup of tea in hand \u2013 two sugars, just as Harry liked \u2013 he felt much calmer. He sipped at it, letting the pleasant warmth spread through his belly as he let the soft scratching of Hermione\u2019s quill against the parchment lull him into something resembling peace.\nEventually, Hermione set the quill aside and folded her hands primly on the desktop before her as she regarded Harry evenly. \u201cAre you feeling better now?\u201d\n\u201cBetter? No, not really,\u201d Harry said and balanced his teacup on one knee. \u201cBut calmer, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said and reached across the desk to lay her hand over his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nOver a week later, Harry had just come back from a walk and was hanging his jacket in the hall closet when they came in through the front door, jostling each other in their haste to get out of the rain that hadn\u2019t been there just a second ago. Malfoy brushed droplets of water from his wool sweater and Other Harry shook his hair and removed his glasses to wipe the raindrops from them.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Malfoy said wryly. \u201cThat was certainly refreshing.\u201d\n\u201cRefreshing?\u201d Other Harry echoed. \u201cIt was fucking freezing.\u201d\nA coy smile curled Malfoy\u2019s mouth. \u201cCold, Potter? Here, allow me to warm you up.\u201d\nHe stuck his hands under Other Harry\u2019s shirt, and Other Harry yelped and squirmed away, but Malfoy stuck his hands down the back pockets of Other Harry\u2019s jeans and hauled their hips together as he caught Other Harry\u2019s mouth in a bruising kiss. It obviously wasn\u2019t their first kiss, because it wasn\u2019t soft or gentle or shy, the way Harry thought first kisses should be. It was hard and vicious and desperate, the way everything had always been between them, and Harry\u2019s mouth went dry as his counterpart grabbed Malfoy and slammed him up against the wall. Malfoy moaned and hooked one leg around the back of Other Harry\u2019s thighs as he rocked his hips up, and all Harry could focus on was how the light blue paint of the walls, the same pale blue of winter skies, set off Malfoy\u2019s complexion perfectly, because if he focused on the rest he was going to lose it right here in the hallway.\nThey certainly looked like they weren\u2019t going to stop, so Harry found himself a bit surprised when Malfoy broke the kiss, dodging awkwardly as Other Harry tried to reclaim his mouth.\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said, soft and breathless, \u201cyou ought to show me the bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cGod yes,\u201d Other Harry said. He grabbed Malfoy by the hand and practically dragged him to the stairs.\nHarry didn\u2019t watch them go, didn\u2019t follow them as they went up. Just stood in the hallway until it wobbled around him and the walls were yellow again. Then he shrugged back into his jacket and went outside into the bright autumn sunshine for another walk. He stopped by the hardware store on his way back, and when he got home he set about repainting the hallway pale blue.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\nMid-afternoon found Harry in the kitchen, brewing his usual mug of tea. At the sound of the familiar voice followed by footsteps coming up the hall, he smiled and reached up into the cabinet for a second mug.\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione said again as she burst into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d She waved a letter excitedly in his direction.\n\u201cGot what?\u201d he asked, pouring hot water into the second mug.\n\u201cYour house. All those things it keeps showing you? It\u2019s your house!\u201d\nHarry plopped a tea bag into the hot water and passed the mug to Hermione before taking up his own. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t follow.\u201d\nHermione took a deep breath, inhaling steam and the sharp scent of Earl Grey. It seemed to center her. \u201cRight. As you know, I was doing research for you. I tried to find anything similar to what you\u2019re experiencing, and I found three separate cases that are exactly what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, feeling brighter than he had all day. Earlier that morning he\u2019d been forced to watch as Other Harry and Malfoy had a screaming row, shouting terribly hurtful things at each other for two blokes who snogged in the hallway and curled up on the sofa together to watch football matches and fetched each other cups of tea. Caught up in his tantrum, Malfoy had picked up that ugly blue vase from the parlor and pitched it at Other Harry. The vase had shattered against the wall just beside his head, and Other Harry hadn\u2019t hesitated as he hit it with a quick Reparo and hurled it right back at Malfoy, and the whole thing had left Harry feeling a little on edge. \u201cHave you found a way to make it stop?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Hermione said. \u201cSort of, but not really.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not going to like this.\u201d\n\u201cStory of my life,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all of the other situations I found involving these\u2026 glimpses, are very similar to yours. Every case had a residence that had belonged to a powerful pureblood family for generations before passing to someone unrelated.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not unrelated,\u201d Harry said with a frown. \u201cSirius was my godfather.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you\u2019re not related by blood. The house doesn\u2019t recognize you as a Black and so doesn\u2019t see you as qualified to own it,\u201d she pointed out.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Harry said, and his frown deepened. \u201cThe house is trying to make me leave?\u201d\nHermione hesitated for an instant. \u201cThe house is trying to get you to bring Malfoy here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The mug nearly slipped from his hand and Harry set it on the counter before he dropped it. Honestly, out of all the things he\u2019d expected, his house being sentient and trying to play matchmaker hadn\u2019t even made the list. \u201cThe house wants a Black living here again, so it\u2019s trying to set me up with Malfoy? Why him? I mean, there\u2019s Andromeda and Teddy, why not them?\u201d\nHermione did her best to hide a smile. \u201cI think they\u2019re a bit old and a bit young for you, respectively.\u201d\nHarry scowled at her. \u201cYou know what I mean. I plan on leaving this house to Teddy anyhow, isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d Something Hermione had said belatedly clicked in his mind. \u201cWait. When you said that there was sort-of-but-not-really a way to make this stop, you didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I did. The visions will stop if you get Malfoy to live here with you.\u201d\nHarry groaned. \u201cWonderful.\u201d\nHermione gave Harry\u2019s arm a pat, her fingers warm from where they\u2019d been curled around her mug of tea. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the answer you were hoping for, but at least it\u2019s an answer. I\u2019ve written to the families I\u2019d found, and two wrote me back. I\u2019ve brought their responses for you to read yourself. It happened a few generations back so there\u2019s not much detail, but I thought you\u2019d like to see it anyhow.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry nodded.\nHe led the way out of the kitchen and down the hall toward the parlor.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely color you\u2019ve picked for the hall,\u201d Hermione commented.\nHarry thought of his other self pushing Malfoy up against the wall, his face flushed and his hair very bright against the blue. \u201cYeah, it is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nAfter Hermione had told him about the house, it began to show Harry more scenes of the possible-future-Harry interacting with Malfoy, all variations on the same theme of their odd version of domestic bliss.\nThat very evening, Harry started as someone came pounding down the staircase, and looked up to find a flustered Malfoy, clad only in a towel with shining drops of bathwater still clinging to his chest and his damp hair darkened to merely blond. His bare feet left moist footprints on the stairs.\n\u201cPotter!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat did you do with my robes? The black wool ones with the little jet buttons on the cuffs and up the front. I specifically remember you said you were going to launder them for me and they\u2019re not in my wardrobe and my interview is in thirty minutes and I am going to be late.\u201d He paused to suck in a breath. \u201cPotter!\u201d\nOther Harry appeared from the kitchen. \u201cCalm down, Draco\u2014\u201c he began, and Harry winced because even from his view on the sidelines he could see from Malfoy\u2019s face that it was precisely the wrong thing to say.\n\u201cCalm down?\u201d he repeated incredulously. His towel slipped a bit and he clutched at it with one hand. \u201cCalm down? I am thirty minutes from what is likely the most important interview of my career. Hipworth Potions Co. \u2013 Britain\u2019s foremost supplier of potions since 17-bloody-81? If I get this position my career is made and I assure you that I will not get this position if I do not find my good robes, which I know you\u2014mmph!\u201d\nOther Harry cut him off quite effectively by taking hold of Malfoy\u2019s head in both hands and kissing him soundly. He pulled back a few moments later, leaving Malfoy a bit dazed but blessedly quiet.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Other Harry said, his voice gentle but firm. \u201cI\u2019ll get your robes, and you\u2019re going to go upstairs and fix your hair while I bring them to you. And above all, you\u2019re going to quit worrying about this because you\u2019re absolutely brilliant and that position\u2019s as good as yours, even if you went in there wearing a burlap sack. It\u2019s going to be fine. Now.\u201d He took Malfoy by one shoulder and steered him back to the foot of the stairs. \u201cUp with you.\u201d He gave Malfoy\u2019s arse a little pat.\nMalfoy blinked at him before recovering a bit of his composure. \u201cI am brilliant, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he murmured as he started up the stairs.\nOther Harry shook his head fondly and watched him disappear over the landing before he headed down the hall to the laundry room.\nHarry stood in the hallway after they\u2019d disappeared. Even though he\u2019d seen lots of other scenes between the two of them play out, it always threw him a bit how comfortable they seemed around each other. How happy they looked together. How every lingering glance showed just how obviously they were in\u2026 love?\nWell. That was a thought Harry wasn\u2019t going to pursue without a nice bracing cup of tea. He went to the kitchen and the warm yeasty smell of fresh-baked bread assaulted his nose. Other Harry stood at the counter, slicing into a somewhat misshapen loaf of bread, and good god that smelled wonderful. Harry decided then and there that he needed to learn how to bake bread.\nAs he watched, Other Harry spread a thick slice with Nutella and took a bite. His eyes fluttered shut and he moaned. Harry\u2019s mouth watered. Just then, Malfoy wandered in, sniffed the air appreciatively and glanced down at the loaf.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting better at that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat one came out almost round.\u201d\nOther Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bit lopsided. I\u2019m going to eat it, not enter it in a beauty pageant.\u201d He held out his Nutella-smeared slice. \u201cHere, try.\u201d\nMalfoy leaned forward and took a bite from the slice of bread held out to him. \u201cMmm,\u201d he said as he chewed.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a little\u2026 just there,\u201d Other Harry gestured at his own face.\nMalfoy\u2019s tongue darted out but missed the smudge of chocolate on his upper lip. \u201cDid I get it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but allow me.\u201d\nOther Harry fastened his mouth to Malfoy\u2019s, licking away the smudge. Malfoy slid one arm around his waist and pulled him close as he deepened the kiss. The slice of bread tumbled from Other Harry\u2019s fingers to land sticky-side-down on the tile floor and neither of them noticed as Draco focused on pushing Other Harry back against the counter and Other Harry curled one hand around Malfoy\u2019s bum. Malfoy lined up their hips and rocked forward, and Other Harry groaned.\nThe scene vanished with a pop, leaving Harry standing alone in his kitchen with his mouth gone dry and his cock half-hard.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry said aloud, and found that he couldn\u2019t think of anything beyond that. So he said again, \u201cWell.\u201d\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nMalfoy and Other Harry vanished from the sofa. They\u2019d been sitting there for a few minutes, curled together under that knitted blanket, while Malfoy regaled his version of Harry with every mind-numbingly boring detail of his day of potions research. Other Harry didn\u2019t really seem to be listening; instead he stared, transfixed, at the shapes Malfoy\u2019s mouth made as he talked. They\u2019d probably start snogging again soon. That seemed to be Other Harry\u2019s preferred method of getting Malfoy to shut up.\nIt had been two weeks since Hermione had worked out that it was his stupid house sending these visions, and Harry was ready to tear his hair out over it, ready to throw things and just scream. Every time he turned around, there was another little glimpse into his other self\u2019s life with Malfoy and it was getting increasingly difficult to reconcile this version of Malfoy with the cruel and sneering one he remembered from Hogwarts.\nSometimes he was tempted to find the real Malfoy and try to start them down the path to this brilliant future together, but then he remembered Malfoy\u2019s foot coming down on his nose, Malfoy swooning dramatically before an imaginary Dementor, Malfoy\u2019s lip curling around the word Mudblood, and Harry just couldn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t think he could take it if he went out searching for this warmer gentler loving increasingly-familiar version of Malfoy, and found the one he remembered from school instead.\n\u201cIs any of this real?\u201d he demanded, frustrated. \u201cHow can I tell if it\u2019s real? If there was just some way to prove\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPotter!\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice echoed up from the entryway. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you bother to tell me,\u201d Other Harry replied from somewhere back in the house. \u201cIt\u2019s noon on Tuesday. I do pay attention to your routines, you know.\u201d His voice took on a posher, crisper accent as he said, \u201cTuesday\u2019s when they get in the new issues of Potions Weekly.\u201d Other Harry laughed and his voice went back to his own. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re not going to sell out. Not many people get that excited over potions magazines.\u201d\nMalfoy snorted. \u201cJust for that, I\u2019m not going to bring you back any Quidditch magazines.\u201d\nOther Harry laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019ll certainly teach me. I\u2019ll have to order the new issue by post. Oh, the horror!\u201d\nThey fell silent.\n\u201cTuesdays at noon,\u201d Harry said to himself. Today was Tuesday and it was just half-eleven now. If he hurried\u2026\nHarry hurried to his den. He had plenty of time to send a quick owl to Ron bowing out of their standing lunch date and get himself to Diagon Alley. If he went to Flourish and Blotts and Malfoy was there. Well. Then he\u2019d know, wouldn\u2019t he?\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nHarry hadn\u2019t really believed that it would happen, but Malfoy walked into Flourish and Blotts at just five minutes past noon. He took a few minutes to linger by a large display near the window featuring Harry\u2019s latest unauthorized biography. Malfoy picked up one from the nearest stack and flipped through it, pulling faces and rolling his eyes so hard that Harry was a little afraid he\u2019d do himself permanent damage. Eventually he replaced the book on its stack and meandered back to the magazine section.\nHarry trailed after him, wishing that he\u2019d thought to bring along his Invisibility Cloak. Instead he did his best to keep out of sight, lingering behind shelves and peering casually through rows of books. Malfoy looked good, Harry noted. A little younger than he\u2019d gotten used to seeing him, and his hair was a little longer. He had to keep shaking it out of his eyes as he leafed through the magazines. Harry wanted to brush his fingers through it, the way he\u2019d seen his other self do a few times before while they sprawled on the sofa together. The other Malfoy had especially seemed to like that, lolling with cat-like pleasure at the touch.\nThis Malfoy would like that too, Harry knew. Because it was Tuesday at noon and here he was, just like the house had shown he would be.\nMalfoy collected a few magazines before he went deeper into the stacks and spent a few minutes perusing the shelves of academic journals. A few times he half-turned in Harry\u2019s direction, and Harry quickly ducked out of sight before he could be spotted. He squeezed by a book cart loaded with teetering stacks of the tawdry romances that Mrs. Weasley pretended she didn\u2019t read and followed along as Malfoy went deeper still, back into the used book section where he browsed through dusty leather-bound tomes for long enough that Harry\u2019s left knee to begin to ache from standing.\n\u201cAs it so happens,\u201d Malfoy said conversationally, \u201cI am neither blind nor deaf, and you haven\u2019t gotten any better at stalking people since Hogwarts.\u201d\nCaught, Harry stepped out from behind his shelf. \u201cUm. Hi.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s eyebrows arched up. \u201cIs that it?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Harry.\nMalfoy\u2019s eyebrows rose a little higher. \u201cReally, you just wanted to say hello?\u201d\nThat sounded reasonable enough \u2013 much more reasonable, at any rate, than the truth \u2013 so Harry nodded.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cNow you\u2019ve said hello, so if you\u2019ll kindly bugger off and leave me to it?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t sound all that irritated when he said it; really, it was pretty damn close to the wry amusement Harry heard all the time from the Malfoy in his house, just a few short steps from what had become Harry\u2019s favorite tone from him. The one that was theatrically put-upon and exasperatedly fond in a way that said you\u2019re an idiot and I love you anyway all at once. His pulse quickened at the notion that the Malfoy in his house and the one standing here in front of him might be the same person after all.\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d Harry blurted out.\nMalfoy had started to turn away, but he stopped and looked back at Harry, head cocked ever so slightly to one side. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t what?\u201d\n\u201cBugger off,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t just want to say hello? What if I wanted to talk to you? Um. I heard you got your Masters in Potions. That\u2019s impressive. What else have you been doing?\u201d\nMalfoy watched him warily for a moment before he said, \u201cThat\u2019s more or less been my life for the last two years. I\u2019ve got an internship with St. Mungo\u2019s that starts in December, so until then I\u2019m just killing time.\u201d\nHarry smiled and waited, then prompted. \u201cI think this is where you\u2019re supposed to ask me what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nThose eyebrows rose again. \u201cAm I?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s sort of how conversation works.\u201d\nMalfoy snorted, and Harry found that noise endearingly familiar. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a conversation, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing okay here. I mean, we haven\u2019t hexed each other or anything.\u201d\nMalfoy rolled his eyes. \u201cAh, yes. Not hexing each other is indeed an essential part of conversation.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s smile broadened into a grin. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing wrong all these years.\u201d His stomach rumbled and he pressed a hand to it. \u201cSorry, I sort of skipped lunch. Would you like to continue not hexing each other somewhere with food?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Malfoy hesitated and Harry could practically watch him weigh the decision as he made up his mind. He sounded faintly surprised with himself as he said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\nHarry waited as Malfoy paid for his small stack of magazines and academic journals and then they walked the two short blocks to a caf\u00e9 that Malfoy suggested. As they sat together at a too-small table, it felt every bit as awkward as a first date should. Harry prompted Malfoy to talk about getting his Masters and his upcoming internship, and then told him a bit about his project of updating Grimmauld Place. As they talked, Harry caught more and more glimpses of the Malfoy he\u2019d grown familiar with, and he let that tenuous familiarity set him at ease and carry him through the conversation.\nGradually, Malfoy relaxed into their conversation as well. He angled his body toward Harry, smiled a bit too often and his eyes lingered on Harry a little too long than was proper. His fingertips brushed against Harry\u2019s as they both reached for the sugar at the same time, and when Harry\u2019s shoe nudged Malfoy\u2019s under the table, Malfoy didn\u2019t move his foot away. At first, Harry was afraid that he was imagining it, but by the end he\u2019d realized that Malfoy was gently flirting with him. So Harry smiled too much back at him and let his own gaze linger as well.\nAt the end of the afternoon as they stood just under the front awning of the caf\u00e9, Malfoy offered Harry another small smile. \u201cWell, Potter. This wasn\u2019t so bad. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be terrible if we were to do it again sometime.\u201d\n\u201cHow about Saturday?\u201d Harry asked. That was five days from now, long enough that he didn\u2019t seem overly eager, he hoped.\nMalfoy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m having lunch with my mother, but I\u2019m free after that. Say, for dinner? Around seven?\u201d\nHarry grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d he said.\nMalfoy hesitated, his expression sliding rapidly through surprise and disbelief before settling on uncertainty. \u201cIs it?\u201d he asked with forced casualness.\n\u201cOh. Um, that\u2019s just an expression,\u201d Harry said, and his heart soared at the way Malfoy\u2019s face fell. He rushed on, \u201cBut it could be. If you\u2019d like.\u201d He rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be.\u201d He had a split second of fear that he\u2019d pushed for too much too fast, but Malfoy only smiled.\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like that too.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll owl you and we\u2019ll figure things out from there?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cUntil Saturday, then.\u201d He brushed his fingers lightly over the back of Harry\u2019s hand, then Disapparated.\nFeeling happier than he had since this whole ridiculous house thing had started, Harry Apparated back to Grimmauld Place. It was almost half-three and although he\u2019d just had lunch and didn\u2019t want tea, Harry found himself going into the front parlor anyhow.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve just had lunch with Malfoy,\u201d Harry announced. He felt a bit silly talking to a house, but Hermione had said it might help. \u201cHe\u2019s agreed to go out with me. We\u2019ve got a date this Saturday.\u201d\nThe room shivered and changed around him as the house showed him a variety of scenes between Other Harry and Other Malfoy. Them snogging on the sofa. Laughing together as they read something from the Prophet. Bickering over the proper way to string up fairy lights and decorate their Christmas tree. Other Harry sitting on the sofa with Other Malfoy\u2019s head in his lap, fingers gently carding through the soft blond strands.\nThe room stopped on another Christmas scene, Other Harry dressed up in a formal robe that the real Harry didn\u2019t own yet, fiddling with something in one hand. Harry moved closer, just in time to see Other Harry flick open the small black velvet box and stare down at the platinum band inside. Footsteps echoed in the hall, and Other Harry hid the box away just as the door opened, his face breaking into a smile so genuine that it made Harry\u2019s heart hurt to see.\nFor all that he was fed up predestination, having had enough with prophecies and fate and destiny to last a lifetime, Harry found himself fervently hoping that these scenes really did come from his future, because he desperately wanted to be that happy. The room trembled and disappeared with a pop.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m doing things right, then,\u201d Harry said aloud.\nHe didn\u2019t think it was his imagination that the house had started to look a little brighter.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nThe house started to show him more images of Draco after that. Harry watched him brew potions, rant about irritating coworkers, laze on the sofa listening to Quidditch matches on the wireless, and make tea. It showed them fighting. It showed them making up. It showed them exchanging chaste good morning kisses, and heated snogging, and a dozen idle innocent touches that turned into something more.\nBecause of that, Harry could only think of Draco as Draco now, no longer Malfoy. Because he really couldn\u2019t bring himself call someone by their surname after he\u2019d seen them get thoroughly fucked by some future version of himself.\nThe house had shown them shagging all over. The parlor sofa was a favorite, as was the shower and, for some reason Harry hadn\u2019t worked out yet, the dining room table. But Harry liked seeing them together in his bed \u2013 their bed \u2013 the best. When they were in bed together, it seemed more intimate. They held each other a little closer, spoke a little softer, and Draco looked at Other Harry like he was the most precious thing in the world. No one had ever looked at Harry like that, and he hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to wait much longer before someone did.\nOne thing remained the same through all of those particular scenes. The other Draco always made an odd sort of half-sobbing noise before he came, and Harry couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the real one did that too.\nHe eagerly counted down the five days.\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nTheir first official date went well, though it started raining on the way home, and they sprinted the last block back to Grimmauld Place. Harry unlocked the door, shivering so hard that the key rattled against the lock before he managed to slot it in, and as soon as the door opened Draco elbowed him aside in his haste to get inside first. Harry laughed and shoved him back and shut the door behind them as Draco brushed sparkling raindrops from his sweater. Harry shook his wet hair out of his face and removed his glasses to wipe the water from them.\nHe felt a vague sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu but honestly couldn\u2019t place it until Draco announced in a voice as dry as his clothes were wet, \u201cWell. That was certainly refreshing.\u201d\nHarry froze with his glasses halfway to his face. \u201cRefreshing?\u201d he echoed as the memory of watching this very scene play out slammed through him. He forced himself to slide the glasses back onto his nose and said carefully, \u201cIt was fucking freezing.\u201d\nDraco turned to him, a sly smile lifting one corner of his mouth. \u201cCold, Potter?\u201d he asked, sidling closer. \u201cHere, allow me to warm you up.\u201d\nHarry knew what was coming next and caught Draco\u2019s hands before they could slip under his shirt. \u201cHey now\u2026\u201d he began, but before he could get out any more than that, Draco crushed his mouth against Harry\u2019s.\nSo. This had been their first kiss after all. It wasn\u2019t anything at all like what Harry thought firsts kisses should be, but he gave a mental shrug and decided to go with it. He slammed Draco back against the wall, and Draco whimpered at the impact but his mouth never left Harry\u2019s. He wrenched one hand free and slid it around Harry\u2019s waist, pulling him closer as they snogged. Harry felt Draco hook one leg around the back of his thighs, felt the hardening length of Draco\u2019s cock press against his own as Draco rocked his hips against Harry\u2019s, and Harry felt his heart pounding against his ribs because he knew what was coming next.\nSure enough, Draco tore his mouth away from Harry\u2019s, and despite himself, Harry tried to recapture it.\n\u201cI think you ought to show me the bedroom,\u201d Draco said, his breath ghosting across Harry\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cGod yes,\u201d Harry said and used his grip on Draco\u2019s wrist to haul him toward the stairs.\nThey went up, half tripping over the steps and each other in their haste to reach the top. Harry led Draco down the hall and into the bedroom, so eager to get Draco out of his clothes and into bed that the soft rhythmic creak of bedsprings didn\u2019t register until he opened the door.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he said, and tried to back out but Draco refused to move. His hand clamped down around Harry\u2019s wrist.\nOther Harry and Other Draco were in bed already, just as naked and occupied with each other as Harry had hoped to be with the real Draco. Other Draco was on his knees and forearms, arse in the air, offered up to Other Harry, who knelt behind him, pressing into him with slow, even strokes. Harry couldn\u2019t drag his eyes away from how the other Draco\u2019s arsehole, slightly reddened and shiny with lubricant, stretched around the cock inside him, how his hips tilted just so as he rocked back with every thrust.\nOther Draco arched his spine and pressed back hard against Other Harry with a small cry. \u201cOh fuck, oh yes, right there. Just like that\u2026 just there, right there,\u201d he panted.\nOther Harry moaned and his fingers tightened their hold on the slender hips before him. \u201cFuck, Draco. You\u2019re so\u2026 God, this is so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know, fuck, I know. Don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop.\u201d Other Draco sounded close to sobbing.\nOther Draco wrapped a hand around his own cock and stroked once, twice, three times, and then came hard, hips bucking as he whimpered through his orgasm, and Other Harry\u2019s thrusts sped up until he came with a gasp. They collapsed onto the bed and curled into each other and shared slow, sleepy, sated kisses and even now they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other, gently stroking anywhere they could reach. The room wavered and a pop echoed as the scene disappeared.\nDraco turned to Harry, his grip on Harry\u2019s arm tightening hard enough to bruise. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of complicated.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest you try to explain,\u201d Draco said. His voice had gone weirdly flat. Harry had heard that tone often enough from Other Draco to know that it meant he was furious.\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cMy house wants me to shag you.\u201d And that sounded unbelievably stupid so he rushed on, explaining, \u201cIt\u2019s upset that there\u2019s no Blacks living here, so it\u2019s been trying to get me to shag you so you\u2019ll live here because you\u2019re a Black. Well, technically you\u2019re a Malfoy but your mum\u2019s a Black and I guess that means you count. Um. I guess I should have warned you about that, but I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with it because it\u2019s so bloody weird. Or you\u2019d think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Harry paused and stared into Draco\u2019s stoic face. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d he added.\nDraco released his arm, and took one step back. Then another, and another. Harry watched him walk down the hallway, listened to his footsteps go down the stairs and fade down the front hall, and then the front door slammed shut with a bang that echoed back to Harry.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said to the house. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly bollixed that up for me. Thanks for that.\u201d\nHarry stripped out of his wet clothes and flung them in the general direction of the hamper. He couldn\u2019t even work up enough energy to be really irritated at Draco for running off. Harry certainly couldn\u2019t blame him for that. Because, honestly. A matchmaking house that showed pornographic glimpses of the future? Why did such strange shit always happen to him?\nAfter changing into a clean pair of underpants, Harry crawled into bed and pulled the blankets over him, listening idly to the sound of raindrops pattering against the windowpane. He didn\u2019t hear the footsteps coming up the hall until they\u2019d nearly reached his bedroom. They hesitated by the door, then came inside. Harry sighed and didn\u2019t roll over.\n\u201cReally, haven\u2019t you done enough?\u201d he said to the house.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco drawled. \u201cI haven\u2019t even started.\u201d\nHarry sat up and stared at Draco, his Draco, with his wet clothes and rain dampened hair. \u201cYou came back.\u201d\n\u201cI never left,\u201d Draco said. He yanked his sweater over his head and tossed it aside so he could fumble with his belt. \u201cI was about to but your barmy house yanked the door out of my hand and slammed it shut.\u201d His trousers dropped to the floor and Draco stepped out of them. \u201cAnd then it showed me exactly what I\u2019d be missing if I left.\u201d His shirt came next, and he shrugged out of it and let it fall to the floor as he stalked over to the bed. \u201cBudge over. It\u2019s bloody cold out here.\u201d\nHarry scooted over and Draco slid into bed beside him.\n\u201cWhat did it show you?\u201d Harry asked.\nDraco\u2019s mouth curled up in a sly smile. \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to find out.\u201d He scooted closer and slid one arm around Harry. \u201cYou really do have the strangest house.\u201d\n\u201cI have the strangest life,\u201d Harry said. He felt a bit dazed, still not quite able to believe that Draco was really here with him, really in his bed and holding him close and, oh god, mostly naked.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Draco said, and he was close enough that his breath tickled Harry\u2019s neck. \u201cThese things your house shows. Are they the future?\u201d\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Harry said. He trailed his fingers lightly up Draco\u2019s ribs just because he could. \u201cWe can change them, though. When we were\u2026 in the hallway, just earlier, I knew you were going to try to put your hands under my shirt because I\u2019ve seen that before. But this time I stopped you. So I think everything will happen, but while it\u2019s happening we can change it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Draco said, and the deep satisfaction in his voice tugged at Harry\u2019s curiosity. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d\nHarry pulled back a little to get a better view of Draco\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did the house show you downstairs?\u201d\nDraco nuzzled at Harry\u2019s neck. \u201cIt showed me us. Together. I looked so happy with you. I\u2019ve never been that happy in my life, and if there\u2019s a chance that will come true, well then. I want to try.\u201d\nHarry couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He kissed Draco, and Draco\u2019s lips parted obediently for him as his tongue pressed cautiously against Harry\u2019s. This wasn\u2019t the desperate, heated snogging that had started down in the hallway. This felt like something different. Like a promise, like a beginning.\nSlowly and without breaking the kiss, Harry moved so he lay atop Draco, warm skin pressed against his own. One of his hands tangled in the damp strands of Draco\u2019s hair while Draco\u2019s hands slid down his back to cup his arse. He shifted his hips slightly until he felt Draco\u2019s erection hard and hot beneath his own, and Draco rocked up against him with a soft whimper.\nWith some effort, Harry pulled his mouth away. \u201cAre we really going to\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said and nipped lightly at the corner Harry\u2019s jaw. \u201cMerlin, yes.\u201d\n\u201cSo how do you want to\u2026?\u201d Harry began and couldn\u2019t finish the thought because now Draco was nibbling his way along the line of Harry\u2019s jaw and Harry found he couldn\u2019t string together a coherent thought while that went on.\nWith a small kiss to Harry\u2019s chin, Draco pulled away slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take me on my hands and knees, aren\u2019t you? I mean, that\u2019s what we saw.\u201d\n\u201cBut that might not have been this time. Or we can change it if you want,\u201d Harry said and paused to suck lightly at Draco\u2019s neck. \u201cThe house has been showing me things for a while. Sometimes you take me on my hands and knees, though that seems to be more for special occasions, I think. Or when you\u2019ve had a rotten day at work.\u201d\nDraco chuckled softly. \u201cThat certainly sounds like me,\u201d he said and pressed his mouth to Harry\u2019s.\nIn the end, they recreated the scene they\u2019d watched play out, with Draco bent over and Harry kneeling behind him. (\u201cThey certainly seemed to be enjoying themselves,\u201d Draco had said and Harry hadn\u2019t been able to argue with that.) It was an exquisite sort of torture for Harry to keep his strokes slow and even with Draco\u2019s body so hot and tight around his own. He desperately wanted to take Draco hard and fast but he wouldn\u2019t last long at all if he did that, so instead Harry focused on trying to find the right angle, the precise tilt of his hips that would make Draco cry out. Beneath him, Draco let out a breathy moan and arched his spine, pressing back against Harry just as Harry shifted slightly, and there it was, that little cry he\u2019d been waiting for.\n\u201cOh fuck, oh yes, right there. Just like that\u2026 just there, right there,\u201d Draco panted, desperate.\nHarry tightened his grip on Draco\u2019s hips until the tips of his fingers whitened and he was sure he\u2019d leave bruises. With Draco crying out wantonly, it was all Harry could do to keep from slamming into him. Just a little longer, just a little more.\n\u201cFuck, Draco. You\u2019re so\u2026 god, this is so\u2026\u201d he choked out through the haze of his own pleasure, because this was so brilliant and so beautiful and it felt so bloody good that he couldn\u2019t even come up with words for it.\n\u201cI know, fuck, I know. Don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop,\u201d Draco begged, and he sounded close to sobbing. He took his own cock in hand and fisted it roughly one, two, three more times and then came hard, his release spattering the bed sheets.\nAnd the broken whimpers he made, the way his arse clenched tight around Harry\u2019s cock as Draco\u2019s orgasm ripped through him, it felt like too much and not enough and Harry lost what little control he clung to. He slammed himself into Draco, his thrusts growing quicker and more erratic until a white-hot ball of pleasure burst in his belly and exploded up his spine. He shoved himself as far into Draco as he could get and hung on, hips twitching helplessly, trying to get impossibly closer as his cock pulsed and he emptied himself into Draco.\nHarry took a moment to regain a little of his breath before he carefully separated himself from Draco and they both dropped to the mattress together, heedless of the damp spots on the sheets. Their legs tangled together, and Harry rubbed his hand along Draco\u2019s side while Draco swept his fingers through Harry\u2019s hair.\n\u201cThat was brilliant,\u201d Harry murmured.\n\u201cOf course it was. It was with me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Draco replied softly.\nHarry laughed and tapped his foot against Draco\u2019s ankle. \u201cYour modesty becomes you.\u201d\nDraco snorted, that ridiculously inelegant sound that Harry loved, so at odds with Draco\u2019s crisp tones and posh accent and aristocratic demeanor. Then again, this Draco in his bed, all flushed and sweaty with charmingly rumpled hair was at odds with that too, and Harry found he liked it just as much.\n\u201cI won\u2019t move in with you yet, you know,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s that modesty again,\u201d Harry said, giving Draco\u2019s ankle another tap before he dragged his toes along Draco\u2019s instep. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked you yet.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Draco said with a smile. \u201cBut you will.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll say yes.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI believe I will.\u201d\n\u00a0\n****\n\u00a0\nHarry sat stiffly on the sofa as butterflies thrummed in his belly. Around him, the parlor was impeccably decorated, with tinsel and colored fairy lights strung up along the walls, and a huge stack of presents beneath the lavishly ornamented tree set up by the window. It was their fourth Christmas together, their third since Draco had moved into Grimmauld Place, and Harry accepted that he might have gone a bit overboard with the gifts this year, even just that morning slipping another two under the tree: a shiny new cauldron elaborately etched with daffodils and a sage green cashmere sweater that would set off Draco\u2019s complexion perfectly. Some part of him evidently felt that the more gifts he bought for Draco this year, the less nervous Harry would feel about the most important one he\u2019d bought. So far it hadn\u2019t worked.\nReaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out a small black velvet box and flipped it open to stare at the platinum band inside. He\u2019d taken to carrying the ring around with him like a talisman for the past few weeks, and had several times been sorely tempted to just propose and get it over and done with so he could quit worrying about it already, and the hell with what the vision had shown him. But he\u2019d thought of them both dressed up in their formal robes before leaving for the Christmas party, the parlor all done up festive and the fairy lights gleaming off Draco\u2019s hair, and Harry had forced himself to wait until Christmas Eve.\nFootsteps echoed up the hallway, and Harry snapped the box shut and jammed it into his pocket just as the door swung open. Draco wore his fine black wool robes, the ones with the little jet buttons, which Draco insisted had landed him his position with Hipworth Potions Co. Harry, of course, told him he was being ridiculous, that his own talents had gotten him the job, but Draco would hear none of it. The robes were lucky, he\u2019d said, and nothing Harry said would convince him otherwise.\nWell, right now Harry was willing to take those robes as a sign. He\u2019d take all the luck he could get.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Draco asked and spread his arms. \u201cWill I do?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Harry said, crossing the room to Draco. \u201cYou\u2019ll absolutely do.\u201d\nThe black robes with their rows of fussy buttons and high collar made Draco look slim and pale and a little severe, and Harry loved it because as haughty and untouchable as they made Draco look, Harry knew it was just a fa\u00e7ade. He\u2019d had the real Draco in his bed that morning, whimpering and damp with sweat, cheeks pink with exertion as Harry\u2019d fucked him into the mattress. And later that night, after they came home from the party, Harry knew he\u2019d get to take Draco upstairs and undo all those little buttons one by one and strip those robes off him like the elegant wrapping of the best present he\u2019d ever receive.\nHarry had originally planned to wait until then to propose, in the quiet intimacy of their dark house, but with the setting sun slanting through the windows to light Draco\u2019s hair and the dazzling smile that lit his face, he just couldn\u2019t wait.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d he said, swallowing past the nervous lump in his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s, um, something I\u2014\u201c\n\u201cCan it wait?\u201d Draco interrupted. \u201cSorry, I know I was a bit slow to get ready and I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d\n\u201cUm, no. It can\u2019t, actually,\u201d Harry said, and opened his mouth to continue but Draco cut him off again.\n\u201cWell, I suppose we can talk as we put our coats on,\u201d he said and then turned and went back into the hall.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Harry said, hurrying after him. \u201cYou need to\u2014I\u2019m trying to ask you\u2026 That is, I want to talk to you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can talk and put on your coat at the same time, Potter. I know I\u2019ve seen you do two things at once before,\u201d Draco said with fond exasperation.\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Harry began. This wasn\u2019t going at all like he\u2019d imagined it would. He fumbled for the ring in his pocket and managed to pry the lid open. Maybe if Draco saw the ring he\u2019d figure out what the fuck was going on and just bloody well cooperate for once in his life. \u201cDraco Malfoy, I\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI will,\u201d Draco said without turning around.\nHarry faltered. \u201cYou will? But\u2026 You haven\u2019t seen\u2026 I haven\u2019t asked you yet.\u201d\nDraco turned back to face him with a smile. \u201cDo you remember our first night together?\u201d\nHarry blinked, momentarily thrown. \u201cWhat? Yes?\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is what the house showed me.\u201d Draco reached out and plucked the ring from the box and slid it onto his finger. \u201cI saw us, and I saw how happy we were, and that\u2019s what convinced me to go back upstairs to you.\u201d He held out his hand and tipped his head to one side as he admired his new ring.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, recovering himself somewhat. \u201cWell. I\u2019d planned to say how much I love you and go on about how attractive you are or how happy you make me or something. You know, make it sort of romantic.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou did, the first time I saw. It was really very sweet but you did tend to go on a bit, so I thought that this time I\u2019d just skip straight to saying yes so you could kiss me.\u201d He paused, then hinted broadly, \u201cI have said yes, you know.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes at that, but couldn\u2019t hide a smile. This wasn\u2019t at all like he\u2019d imagined, but it was just so perfectly them that he wouldn\u2019t change a thing about it. \u201cI assume that means you\u2019d like me to kiss you now?\u201d\n\u201cYou assume correctly,\u201d Draco said with a smirk.\nSo Harry did."
