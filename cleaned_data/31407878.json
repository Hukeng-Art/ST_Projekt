    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Hey! I will start off by saying I wrote this after both 2 consecutive days of AP exams and my second shot of Covid vaccine. I will not be surprised if I come back and realize half of this work is incomprehensible. That is fine.</p>\n<p>I was inspired to write this after binging my way through all of sircantus' works that I hadn't already read. Not sure where this one is gonna go from here, as there was zero planning, but who knows. Making it up along the way can be good sometimes too.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it lol</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>There's that. Thanks for reading this first bit, no idea when I'll have another chapter because idk what's even going on right now lmao. It is bedtime for me. Sleep time.</p>\n<p>You're all cool people, keeping vibing my friends</p>\n<p>Hey y'all! There's already been a far greater interest in this work than I expected, so thanks for that. You guys really are suckers for SBI found family stuff, aren't you? (It's okay, I am too)</p>\n<p>I don't have much to say today, except that I only have one week left of school and that means all I have to do is get through finals and I'm home free. (It also means that I lose my school laptop, but whatcha gonna do. Back to writing in the notes app of my phone lol)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Dream, acting like a big brother to Tommy? Yes. We need more good Dream content. I hate c!Dream, but I can't help but feel bad for him after the Quackity lore, so I decided to add him in as a nice guy. Give us a bit of a break from sad Dream content, you know?</p>\n<p>Hope y'all liked the chapter, I'll say again that I am currently making this up as I go, so if there's plot holes, no there isn't. I do not see</p>\n<p>Have a great day! :)</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve finally done it! I\u2019ve written another chapter for this work!</p>\n<p>God, I had the worst writers block for this fic, which is really upsetting because the ending is really good but I can never seem to write the middle to things.</p>\n<p>And then when I finally got around to writing, my few elite Insta followers saw that at like 1pm today, I accidentally deleted like the first nearly 1k words of this chapter and promptly lost my shit. It\u2019s cool tho, we re-wrote it and it\u2019s all good.</p>\n<p>Anywho, enjoy! :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Rivalstwt come get y\u2019all juice-</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for sticking around for so long, sorry this took like a billion years to update.</p>\n<p>Also, rest assured that I will not be abandoning this fic, ever. In typical me fashion, I went ahead and wrote like the whole like climax scene (second to last chapter) and it\u2019s really good, so now I have to actually see this through so I can post it lmao</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>EDIT: Hey a brilliant person in the comments suggested I ask for ideas for round 2 which is great because I am struggling, so if anyone has something, kindly share it in the comments thank you very much</p>\n<p>So, I\u2019m back. Sorry about the wait once again, folks. Gonna confess right now, this one is a bit of a filler chapter.</p>\n<p>1) Because I needed to develop the relationships between characters more<br>2) Because I am most definitely stalling as I try to drag myself through the next challenge lmao</p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I finally got something out tho, I have been going through it in the last week and finally writing something has helped make up for it</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Do I need to keep pittng SBI and Dream against each other? Nah. But it\u2019s funny, so imma do it anyways.</p>\n<p>Side note, here\u2019s some life advice for you guys:</p>\n<p>- Poison ivy sucks ass and does not combine well with a whacky immune system and eczema. Would not recommend. Wear shoes when walking in the woods, y\u2019all.<br>- Any day can be redeemed by a little bit of fog at sunset, a good music album, and a large bowl of cubed water melon.</p>\n<p>Now go, be free. Use my wisdom to improve your lives this instant</p>\n<p>A quick summary of my week:</p>\n<p>- Gets intense vigilante AU brainrot and is forced to beat it back with a proverbial broom<br>- Accidentally give myself writers block as a result of said proverbial broom<br>- Very, very tired (poison ivy meds suck)<br>- Mild mental breakdown (see previous for reason lmao)<br>- Finalized decision to never have children of my own after dealing with work</p>\n<p>Big shoutout to goldhyuck for kicking my ass into gear and literally booting me out of writer block. Idk how that works but it was a damn miracle. Thanks dude</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This was a really short update, but fear not. This was originally part of one chapter with the actual second challenge in it, but I\u2019m like 2/3 of the way through writing and it\u2019s already over 5k words, so I had to split it up for the sake of my own sanity.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m on a roll though, so you\u2019ll most likely be getting either a double update today or the second half of this chapter at like 2 in the morning. We\u2019ll have to see.</p>\n<p>Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have more writing to do</p>\n<p>*Aggressively slams this down on the table before grinning at y\u2019all and promptly passing out*</p>\n<p>I wrote entire thing within about 24 hours. It\u2019s literally half the length of the rest of the fic I- I don\u2019t understand. How. H o w.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for all the suggestions, they really helped me figure out what the hell to write. Anyways, enjoy your middle of the night update</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Fun fact: the whole pendant-puzzle-thing (and literally half to content of this chapter) is actually from a dream I had like, years ago. But it fit the theme so... <em>ta da</em>. Wild stuff right there</p>\n<p>I hope y\u2019all didn\u2019t get to attached to Quinn, he\u2019s gonna show up like once after this lmao, I just needed a partner for Tommy. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and like 1700 kudos. I kinda just blinked and it was there, but seriously. Y\u2019all are the best :)</p>\n<p>Me: I don\u2019t really have plans for this OC, he\u2019s kinda just a plot device-</p>\n<p>Literally all of you in the comments: Quinn is now my favorite, I will die for him</p>\n<p>By popular demand, it seems, I\u2019ve decided to try to fit him into a few more scenes. Did not expect him to be such a hit, but alright- you win. I surrender.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s just some funny and cute bits to break up the time between rounds- please enjoy :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Look- it\u2019s cute.</p>\n<p>Not sure what kinda drugs I am currently on that\u2019s allowing me to write this much in so little time, but hey. More updates for you. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m gonna keep riding this momentum as long as I can, but do not be surprised if it suddenly takes me another week to get the next chapter out. Next chapter is the start of the final round, and action scenes are hard for no good reason, man</p>\n<p>The Vibes\u2122\ufe0f as of late:</p>\n<p>Me: You know, I haven\u2019t watched the lore streams in like a month or more, I think my hyper fixation is finally ending. I\u2019m just not as attached to the characters as I used to be</p>\n<p>Also Me: Sees 1 (one) singular tiktok in which all the dsmp characters get happy endings and promptly bursts into tears</p>\n<p>Still Me: Stays up until 4:22 am reading fanfics again, spends free time the next day working on my own</p>\n<p>Yep, definitely over this fandom. Totally.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here y\u2019all go- it\u2019s a little messy and the pacing is kinda funky, so I\u2019m not <em>super</em> happy with it, but whatever. I simply do not care anymore. Take it. Begone.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my fa-</p>\n<p>Also sorry for the lack of like, actual fight scenes in this one. I was gonna write all three of Tommy\u2019s individual rounds but the next chapter is also a massive fight scene and honestly, I\u2019m lazy. They\u2019re so hard for no reason, but I tried. Sorry.<br>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>You guys crack me up, you really do. The comments on last chapter? Immaculate.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t wait to see your reactions to this one. I simply cannot wait.</p>\n<p>(Please don\u2019t kill me)</p>\n<p>CW: Blood, implied murder</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little fun fact for you all- I wrote this entire chapter (minus the fight scene) before I even wrote chapter two. Do with that information what you will.</p>\n<p>Now, to sit back and let the chaos unfold.</p>\n<p>See y\u2019all later lmao</p>\n<p>Edit (because there seems to be a little confusion):</p>\n<p>PSA: DREAM IS NOT DEAD. MANS IS JUST PASSED OUT. THAT IS ALL</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>Would you look at that. We\u2019re at the end already.</p>\n<p>I just wanna say thank you so much for all the kudos and comments on this work, I didn\u2019t mention it nearly enough. I even saw some people rec this on TikTok? Like, what? I love you guys so much, just thank you for all the support. It catches me off guard every time.</p>\n<p>This chapter might be a little sloppy, it\u2019s currently 3:21 am right now and I wrote half of this in one go. But I\u2019m gonna be traveling all over for the next like 6 days, so I was trying to get this done before that.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the ending, my friends :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s a wrap. I\u2019m not sure how to feel about this work, honestly. I\u2019m not nearly as attached to it as some of my other stuff, but I sure had fun writing some of it, and reading all your comments. Just- thanks so much guys.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m gonna try to start a new work soon, but I\u2019ve got school starting in like a month and a shit ton of college apps stuff to do, and it\u2019s a long work (extensive plot woo), so that may have to go on the back burner for a bit. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, feel free to come to over to Instagram, it\u2019s linked in my profile bio, I\u2019m planning a post when I get back from travels if anyone wants to check it out, or just chat or something.</p>\n<p>Until next time, yeah? </p>\n<p>*salutes*</p>\n<p>Incredible fan art from @starchild989_ that deserved to be linked just about a million years sooner than this: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CYHQCpnrUBp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siren</a></p>",
    "text": "The attendant glanced up as a hand slammed down onto the table, rattling the jar of ink and the quill within it. From the look on his face, the man was entirely unimpressed.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\nThe teen before him grinned, a toothy smile shot full of confidence and promising nothing but trouble.\n\nNot one of these kids again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be entered into the tournament please, if you would,\u201d the kid said with the casual air of someone who expects everything to magically work out in their favor, somehow. He\u2019d seen it all before, though. Some upstart wandered into the tent every year, expecting to be entered into the fights and win because they were Mommy\u2019s special boy with an ego and a god complex.\nThe attendant glanced down at the scuffed iron sword tucked into the waist of the boy\u2019s pants, skeptical. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely, big man. Completely fuckin\u2019 positive.\u201d\nThe grin hadn\u2019t faded. \n\nThis kid has no idea what\u2019s coming.\n\nHe squinted up at the teen. \u201cYou have a proper sword? A shield? Literally any gear? That toothpick you\u2019ve got there won\u2019t do much for you, I\u2019ll be honest.\u201d\nThere was an annoyed huff, followed by a rolling of eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know it\u2019s not fancy or anything, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The boy reached down and patted the worn hilt lovingly. \u201cShe\u2019s saved my ass plenty of times, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nThe attendant sighed, reaching out to pluck the quill from the bottle, hovering over a chart of names. \u201cYour funeral, I guess. Name?\u201d\n\u201cTommy Innit.\u201d\nThere was a scratching of pen on paper, another name added to the growing list of participants. This kid would simply be one of many who got their ass beat in the arena. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\nWith a final flourish, the teen\u2019s name was registered. \u201cAlright, rounds start tomorrow, at noon. Bracket system will be used, winner of the pair advances to the next round, you know the drill.\u201d The attendant looked up at the boy who stared back at him, eyes filled with both excitement and a serious determination.\n\u201cWelcome to the Tournament of the Gods, Tommy Innit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTommy sauntered out of the tent, whistling merrily to himself. A grin split his cheeks, hands tucked into his fraying pockets as he made his way down the crowded street, dodging tourists, vendors, and the occasional small child with ease. \nHe had done it. They had actually let him in. \n\nHe was in the Tournament.\n\nThe crowd up ahead grew thicker, the flow of people slowing down to a crawl as different stands popped up from the streets, all sorts of fruits and baked goods stacked upon each other, bright banners and scarves hung and fluttering in the wind, ornate knives and swords shimmering in the noonday sun. Tommy meandered through the market, stopping at the occasional stand to admire a neat sword, or to chat with the nice lady who ran the fruit stand and always snuck him an apple or two. (He loved that lady.)\nThis time of year was always the busiest, the most lively the city ever was. It was also Tommy\u2019s favorite. People flocked from all over the place to participate in the annual festival, and to witness the main attraction, the infamous \u201cTournament of the Gods\u201d. \nThe whole point of the celebration was to honor the deities who were believed to watch over the earth, bestowing hints of their powers and wisdom upon only the most worthy and righteous. The whole idea of the tournament first began as a way to provide the gods with a clear candidate for the blessing, offering up a victor at the end of many duels and trials. Over time, the seriousness of the tournament relaxed, and more people entered just for the sake of the challenge.\nBut there were still some who took the tournament seriously, training year round just for the chance to obtain the blessing of the gods. Personally, Tommy thought those people were insane and really needed to get a hobby. \nHe, on the other hand, had entered because he was bored and had nothing better to do with his time. Plus, it\u2019d be funny.\n\nNot that anyone else would get the joke but him, but still. The opportunity was too good to pass up.\n\nSeventeen was the cutoff for the competition. Sure, some kids snuck in every year, squeezing by with a bit of early height to them, but no one younger than 20 or something had made it to the finals, much less won the thing. \nTommy was going to be the first. That was just a fact.\nAfter a little more perusing, Tommy left the crowded market square, making his way down toward the older part of the city, ancient buildings built of stone and brick, friendly fronts sagging with age and generations of memories. \nHe\u2019d go back to the market that night for the ceremony and dance at sundown that celebrated the official opening of the festival. The music was always wonderful, and he couldn\u2019t wait to retreat to his favorite rooftop and let the melodies wash over him, warming him even as the sun dipped below the horizon. It was tradition, after all.\nHumming to himself, Tommy wandered down the worn cobble street. The size of the crowd was much thinner in this area, the atmosphere a more somber one, full of a quiet sort of reverence and respect as opposed to the energetic fervor of the marketplace. This attitude, while the polar opposite of the personality that was one Tommy Innit, was a familiar and comforting one.\nUp ahead, the buildings fell away, singling out a lone structure, made of carefully crafted pillars of quartz and granite, the grounds well kept. The city temple, dedicated to the gods. Traffic to the temple was heavier than usual, but that was to be expected this time of year.\nAfter all, it was a festival for the gods. Duh.\nTommy skipped up the steps, perfectly at home among the airy ceilings and polished stone floors. People flocked to a raised dais at the center of the room, three quartz statues standing proud upon it. An open skylight in the roof bathed the sculptures in sunlight, highlighting the dramatic curves and features of the deities depicted. \nTommy\u2019s steps slowed, coming to a halt behind a group of religious visitors, some lost in prayer or simply just in awe of the sight before them. \nThe Blood God, the Siren, and the Angel of Death all stared back with blank expressions, looking down upon the mortals with empty stone eyes. \nMajestic, right?\nSnickering to himself, Tommy stepped forward into the line of sight of the statues before promptly flicking them all off. \nBeside him, he heard a horrified gasp, and Tommy turned, raising an eyebrow at the scandalized look that a woman was giving him.\n\u201cYou alright, miss?\u201d he asked, choking back another laugh at the look on her face. Priceless.\n\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?\u201d she breathed, glancing up at the stern faces of the gods before them. \u201cYou\u2019ve just insulted the deities in their temple, right on the opening night of the celebrations! How do you think they\u2019re going to react?\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes, stuffing his hands back in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t mind, not the exactly first time I\u2019ve done shit like that.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s eyes widened even more.\nTommy smirked. \u201cWon\u2019t be the last time, either. Gotta keep up good \u2018abits, right?\u201d\nShe took a step back, shaking her head. \u201cMay the gods have mercy on you, child. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t, but thanks anyway.\u201d\nThe woman scurried away to another corner of the temple, casting a fearful glance over her shoulder as she went.\n\nNever fails to freak someone out. Classic.\n\nTommy grinned up at the statues, perfectly at ease. No lightning bolts rained down from the sky, no heart attack made him drop down dead at the feet of the believers around him. This was as to be expected, considering greeting the statues with a curse or quick toss of the middle finger had been his routine for years now.\nSome god-fearing believer, steadfast in their concern over the power of the gods always decided to question his sanity. The record number of requests for mercy on his soul in one day was somewhere around 11. He was still trying to beat that record, but hadn\u2019t come close yet.\nAll of this wasn\u2019t to say that Tommy wasn\u2019t a believer in gods and immortal beings. Far from it. In fact, out of everyone in this room, in this city, hell- maybe in the nation\u2013 Tommy could easily be called the most faithful person out there. It\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t buy into the whole \u201ctreat them with utter respect because otherwise fiery hell will rain down upon you and curse your bloodline for the next 1000 years to always have bad luck\u201d shit. \nHe knew better.\nPleased with his personal choice of greeting, Tommy separated from the small crowd grouped around the statues, slipping away into an emptier part of the temple. Torches lit up the walls where the sunlight from the central chamber didn\u2019t quite reach, combating what would otherwise be a persistent sense of abandonment. Tommy casually passed pillars and carvings depicting the history of the city and the gods' influence, heading for the back of the temple. \nUp ahead, the torch-lit gloom cleared, revealing a small window cut into the walls of the temple, the glass long gone and letting in a warm breeze. Across from it was a forgotten alcove, filled with a messy pile of blankets, the walls hung with various mementos, trinkets precariously balanced upon a shelf made of two carved quartz wings.\n\nHome.\n\nWithout hesitation, Tommy flopped face first into the mound of blankets, enjoying the familiar comfort after a long day of standing in line in front of that stupid tent. Gods, the other people there had been so fucking annoying, telling him to go home and find his mommy.\nWell he didn\u2019t have one, thank you very much. Take that, idiots.\nGroaning, Tommy rolled over, staring at the ceiling for a moment. He soaked up the peace, letting the events of the morning wash over him.\nOnce satisfied with his brief moment of contemplation, Tommy sat up, shouting \u201c\u2018Ey bitches, I\u2019m back!\u201d\nFor a moment, nothing happened.\nAnd then the gentle breeze coming through his little window picked up, rushing into the corridor and swirling about. The sunlight grew brighter, the space swelling with light for a split second, rising in a crescendo along with the wind for a moment before dying back down again. The air stilled, light dimming, and the corridor was once again restored to its previous state of emptiness.\nA hand reached out and ruffled Tommy\u2019s hair.\nHe smiled, leaning into the feeling of fingers gently carding through the curly mess. \u201cFucking took you long enough.\u201d\nThere was an annoyed huff, and the hand left his hair, much to his dismay. \u201cI was busy. Answering prayers, being a benevolent and all powerful being, that sort of thing.\u201d\nTommy leaned back, eyebrow raised at the being in front of him. \u201cNormally you show up the instant I offer my greeting. I was waiting for you to appear an\u2019 cause a scene. Imagine my disappointment, Wil.\u201d\nWilbur sighed, settling himself down on the ground in front of Tommy. \u201cYeah, yeah gremlin. No need to get all worked up about it. I\u2019ll help you terrorize the public during the ceremony tonight, deal?\u201d\n\u201cSounds great, but \u2019m not sure Mr. Righteous Angel is gonna be cool with that, Big Dubs. Remember what happened last time you accidentally revealed yourself to the general public?\u201d\nWilbur rolled his eyes, leaning back on the palms of his hands. \u201cIt was just a little increase in traffic at the temple, Tommy. Not really a big deal-\u201d\n\u201cYou started a religious revival,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cThere were suddenly prophets claiming the world was ending every other hour. It was awful.\u201d\nHe remembered that disaster vividly, despite the years between then and now. People screaming on the streets, flooding the temple with worried visits and desperate prayers. The chaos made it hard to sleep and people kept getting in his way, begging him to save himself from the end of the world. In summary, awful.\nWilbur waved him off. \u201cAs if that doesn\u2019t happen like once a decade or so, come on.\u201d\nTommy leveled him with an unimpressed look.\n\u201cFine, moving on.\u201d Wil's expression shifted to one of excitement, a mischievous grin taking over his face. He leaned in. \u201cDid they let you in? Are you in the tournament?\u201d\nTommy scoffed. \u201cOf fuckin\u2019 course I am!\u201d He puffed out his chest, posing. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t refuse Big Man Innit the opportunity to gain the favor of the gods, not with how absolutely poggers and worthy I am!\u201d\nThey both grinned, knowing damn well Tommy didn\u2019t need a competition of all things to gain the attention of higher powers.\nWilbur snickered. \u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how it went.\u201c\nTommy\u2019s pose faltered, triumphant look deflating. \u201cThat guy acted like a right bastard,\u201d he muttered angrily. \u201cJudged my sword \u2019n everything. Do you know how rude that is? How offensive? I am wounded, Wil. Gutted. Destroyed. There will be no recovering from this-\u201c\nWilbur reached forward and flicked him on the forehead, laughing at the scandalized expression he got in response. \u201cI\u2019m sure your pride will be fine. In all my centuries, I\u2019ve never met someone with an ego half as large as yours. You\u2019ll recover.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking that as a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cYou do that.\u201d\nWilbur stood and stretched, golden robes shifting around him, catching the light. \u201cI\u2019ll inform Techno of the news. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll actually bother to watch the tournament this year now that there\u2019s someone actually interesting to cheer for.\u201d\n\u201cAwe, so you do care!\u201d\nWilbur laughed, reaching out to ruffle his hair once more. \u201cOf course I do, Toms. You\u2019re our favorite mortal, it\u2019s always been that way-\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing the clingy god shit again.\u201d\nWilbur just smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the rooftop tonight, okay?\u201d\n\u201cSounds great, Big Man. See you there.\u201d\nWith a twist of the light and warping of air, the Siren was gone once again.\nTommy leaned back into his little alcove, watching the sky through the window. He grinned.\nTomorrow, he would be competing in the Tournament of the Gods, fighting tooth and nail for a chance at victory. For a chance to win the favor of the gods.\n\nPhil was so gonna get a kick out of this one.\n\nMusic drifted up to the rooftops, from jukeboxes and people playing on their well-loved instruments, carried by a damp breeze that signaled the night\u2019s beginning. The sun had set, leaving buildings to wait in darkness, their windows cold, rooms empty. Instead, the streets glowed with the golden light of lamps and torches. Brazers of flame washed the faces of laughing people bronze as they clapped along to the music or danced down the street, hand in hand. Children ran through the crowd, their shrieks trailing behind them like the colorful ribbons clutched in their fists, mimicking the banners that wove between rooftops, gently swaying in the wind.\nUpon one of these roofs sat Tommy. His legs dangled over the busy main square, kicking absentmindedly as he looked out over the maze of streets glowing under the dark sky like Ariadne\u2019s string through the labyrinth. To an outsider, the sight might be lonely: a kid sitting by himself in the dark, stuck above everyone else and alone. \nBut Tommy wasn\u2019t alone. He was just waiting.\nHe sighed, letting his arms go slack and flopping back onto the roof, staring up at the stars above him. They were taking fucking forever.\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 gods can teleport \u2019n shit and yet they\u2019re always late- can\u2019t have anything around here,\u201d he grumbled, tracing the constellations with lazy fingers. \u201cNext thing you know I\u2019ll be dying or something and they\u2019ll show up late for that, too-\u201c\n\u201cWho\u2019s dying?\u201d\nTommy jumped in surprise, turning his head to glare at the sandals next to his face. \u201cMe, now that you\u2019ve given me a fuckin\u2019 heart attack, idiot.\u201d\nThere was a chuckle, followed by the quiet whisper of green robes as the Angel of Death sat down beside him, giving him a kindly pat on head in apology. \u201cSorry mate, forgot you can\u2019t tell I\u2019m coming when I use the shadows to travel.\u201d\nTommy sat up, grumbling. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re always with Wil and he\u2019s obnoxiously obvious with his flashy entrances.\u201d\nPhil laughed again. \u201cRight you are.\u201d\nAt that moment, the stars grew brighter, flaring in the sky as the fires below them twisted into something else entirely.\n\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Phil said, smiling.\nThe alien light died down, and Wilbur appeared on the roof behind them, dusting off his golden robes.\nTommy didn\u2019t turn around, gaze fixed on the city laid out before him. \u201cYou\u2019re late, bitch.\u201d\nWilbur huffed. \u201cI\u2019m not that late, it\u2019s like two minutes or something-\u201c\n\u201cOne hour and twenty three minutes past sunset. That\u2019s not two minutes, dickhead.\u201d\nThe god sighed, coming over to sit beside him and drape an arm around Tommy\u2019s shoulder, pulling him close despite half-hearted protests. Wilbur set his chin on top of Tommy\u2019s head, ignoring the muttered curses he got in response. \u201cTo us, that\u2019s practically nothing, child. Leave me be.\u201d\nTommy tried to squirm his way out of Wilbur\u2019s grip before quickly giving in, due to years of experience knowing that if he tried to escape, Wilbur would just charm him back into his arms again anyways. Stupid gods and their stupid godly powers.\n(And no, he did not enjoy the hug. Absolutely not. Not at all. Shut up.)\n\u201cI\u2019m never gonna leave you be,\u201d he muttered. \u201c\u2018M a big man who causes problems on purpose an\u2019 you guys are never getting rid of me. Deal with it.\u201d\nWilbur and Phil both chuckled at that, much to his offense. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, Toms,\u201d Phil said kindly, smiling softly at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll always want you around.\u201d\nTommy leaned back into Wilbur, ignoring the stupid little coo the god always gave whenever he relented to the forced affection. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not immortal,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cCould you imagine having to put up with you three bastards for eternity?\u201d He scrunched up his face, tongue sticking out. \u201cYuck.\u201d\nThe temperature on the roof dropped a degree or two, the way it always did when Tommy brought up the fact that he was actually in fact, a human, and liked it that way, thank you very much. Wilbur\u2019s grip on him tightened ever so slightly. Tommy rolled his eyes. \n\nPossessive bastards, the lot of them.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d he sat up, pushing away from Wilbur, who whined at the loss of child in his arms. \u201cUnless I\u2019m \u2018allucinating, I\u2019m only counting two of you. Where\u2019s Techno at?\u201d\nPhil shrugged. \u201cNot sure, haven\u2019t seen him in a while. He\u2019s probably off somewhere watching the drunk mortals fight in alleys and critiquing their form or something.\u201d\nTommy nodded knowingly. \u201cSounds like him.\u201d\nWilbur leaned forward, peering over the edge of the rooftop to watch the celebration taking place down below. \u201cWhy do you need him anyways? We can cause enough problems on our own to be entertaining- all I have to do is appear in the middle of that crowd over there-\u201c\n\u201cWil, no-\u201c\nTommy crossed his arms, watching with a hidden smile as Phil pulled Wilbur away from the edge, giving him the \u201cdon\u2019t start another episode of mass hysteria just for your own personal entertainment or I swear to myself I will punt you into the cosmos\u201d look. \nTommy hummed, looking out over the city. \u201cYou sure he\u2019s not gonna come?\u201d\nWilbur waved a hand. \u201cTechno is a boring bitch, of course he wouldn\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cTechno is what now?\u201d\nTommy glanced behind him, grinning at the sight of the Blood God, pink hair flowing and arms crossed, one brow raised in a challenge. To anyone else, it would probably be intimidating, even frightening. Tommy was just happy to see him. \nTommy cheered. \u201cBlade! You\u2019re here!\u201d He turned to Wilbur, grin turning into a smirk. \u201cGo make an appearance Wil, it seems the world is actually ending.\u201d\nA hand smacked the back of his head and he laughed, ducking away. \u201cVery funny, kid. I\u2019m cryin\u2019 myself laughing.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, I try.\u201d\nTechno settled himself down next to them. \u201cAnd for the record,\u201d he said, turning to Wilbur with a smug look on his face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t skippin\u2019 out cause I\u2019m a loser, I was gettin\u2019 these.\u201d He reached into his scarlet robes and pulled out a paper bag, one that Tommy recognized instantly.\nHis eyes lit up, hand immediately grabbing for it. \u201cI demand them this instant. Surrender the goods, big man.\u201d\nTechno grinned, passing the bag over. Tommy practically tore it open, grinning in delight at the contents. He stuck a hand in, pulling out a slice of \u201cgolden apple\u201d. They were an imitation of the real thing, the specially made apples with magic imbued in them, used in battle for healing purposes. These ones were a street food made during the festival this time of year, coated in butterscotch candy and drizzled with a golden syrup.\nThey were his absolute favorite, and Techno knew it.\nHe bit into one, sighing in contentment at the sweet flavor. \u201cTechno is now my favorite. I don\u2019t need you anymore Wil, you can go now,\u201d he garbled, syrup gluing his teeth together.\n\u201cYeah Wil,\u201d Techno snarked. \u201cLeave, we don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d\nWilbur spluttered, protesting. \u201cAw, come on! You can\u2019t just bribe your way into being Tommy\u2019s favorite!\u201d\nTechno crossed his arms. \u201cI can and I will.\u201d\nThe two of them devolved into a familiar sort of bickering, punctuated by insults and the occasional smacking sound as someone hit the other. Tommy ignored them, joyfully kicking his feet back and forth as he bit into one of the treats, going back to watching the crowd below. Phil joined him, gratefully taking the slice of apple Tommy offered him. They sat, listening to the music and the laughter, Tommy\u2019s hands and tongue sticky with warm syrup.\nThere was a reason why this was his favorite time of year.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe energy the of next day was in polar contrast to the lazy warmth of the night before. Tommy found himself up bright and early, a beam of sunlight covering his mound of blankets. He was wide awake within minutes, excitement thrumming under his skin. \n\nTournament Day. It was Tournament Day.\n\nHe scrambled out of bed, pulling on proper clothing for the arena\u2019s challenges, shoving his feet into a pair of well-worn and well-loved boots at lightning speed. Tommy shoved some food in his mouth, already running down the empty halls of the temple. He was halfway to the central chamber before realizing had left his sword behind, and had to do a 180 to go back and get it.\nHe burst out into the central chamber, flying between patrons there to worship on this especially holy day. Upon passing the statues in the center, Tommy flipped them off with both hands, just to add in a little variety. He ignored the scandalized gasps, already out the door and into the street, on a one-man mission to reach the arena where the Tournament was held. \nTommy skillfully wove his way through the throng of spectators, following a far sparser crowd over to the back entrance, where those who would be participating in the challenges were meant to report. \nA woman was standing by the door, checking people in with a piece of parchment, crossing names from the list. Tommy impatiently waited in line, scoping out his competition as he slowly inched forward. The competitors were more on the younger side, the vast majority in their twenties or thirties, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see people older than that enter, either for the sake of tradition or for the fun of it. Most of the time, though, the older entries were a select few of the religious fanatics who devoted their days to training for the Tournament, so obsessed with another chance of obtaining the blessing of the Gods that they entered year after year after year.\nIn Tommy\u2019s opinion, it was a massive waste of time. Wilbur and Techno weren\u2019t even that cool (Philza, obviously, was an exception to this, because well, Phil). Why people spent so much time fuckin\u2019 lusting over their powers and attention was something Tommy would never understand.\nHe got to the front of the line, the woman glancing up from the paper to look at him, eyebrows practically escaping into her hairline. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re supposed to be here, kid?\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, I am. Name\u2019s Tommy Innit.\u201d\nThe lady gave him a disbelieving look, but checked the list anyway, face falling into surprise at the sight of Tommy\u2019s name on the list. She slowly crossed it off, gesturing to her left. \u201cGo through there, prepare however you want. Supply your own gear for the first round, but those who make it to later rounds will be given the option to use provided equipment.\u201d She looked up at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cThat means don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 planning on it,\u201d Tommy muttered, moving past her. He held onto his sword, the familiar weight and feel of it at his side a comfort. With the sword, he really wouldn\u2019t need anything else.\nHe stepped through the doorway into an open room, the walls made of a polished sandstone, matching the rest of the arena. The walls hung with banners of gold, red, and green, different runes and symbols stitched into them. There were polished shields hanging as well, stands of armor tucked away behind worn benches and racks of swords and other equipment.\nTommy retreated to a less crowded corner of the room, pulling two lengths of cloth from a pocket as he went. He began to wrap his hands and wrists, making sure to keep it loose enough that he still had full mobility of his fingers, but snug enough that he wouldn\u2019t get blisters. \nNormally, he wouldn\u2019t bother to do this for a sword fight, but the first couple rounds of the Tournament were always unpredictable. Sometimes they were a parkour-type thing, meaning padding on his palms would be helpful for jumping from structure to structure and being able to catch himself. Other times the first round was a team event, like capture the flag with more than two teams and extra twists thrown in. Never knew when you might have to throw a punch, either.\nThe final rounds were always one-on-one duels, that was a given. But this round? Tommy had no idea what to expect.\nHe finished up his left hand, moving onto the right. At the same time, Tommy watched the room in front of him, people calling out to old friends, others strapping on light sets of armor or polishing swords. There were all sorts of people, the room a mismatch of colors and metals, heights and ages.\nOut of the corner of his eye, Tommy caught a brief flash of eye-searing lime green, and his heart jumped in his chest. \n\nNo way-\n\nHe spun, searching the crowd for another glimpse, another look, but there was nothing. Just a trick of the light. Tommy stamped down the disappointment, focusing back on lightly wrapping up his hands while quietly berating himself for getting his hopes up. He wove the cloth around his palms, scowling to himself. \n\nHe\u2019s been gone for weeks, of course he\u2019s not gonna come back just for some stupid tournament-\n\nA pair of arms suddenly wrapped around him and Tommy screamed. He batted at the hands, pushing away as the person wheezed behind him, doubling over as they laughed, clutching at a horrendous neon green hoodie as they tried to catch their breath.\nTommy scowled, heat rushing to his cheeks as some of the nearby competitors cast him strange looks. \u201cDream, you absolute bastard! Why would you do that?\u201d\nDream laughed harder, wiping tears from his eyes. \u201cGod you- you were so scared! I can\u2019t believe- ha!\u201c He broke into a fit of giggles, sitting down on the bench beside where Tommy stood to catch his breath as Tommy glared at him. Despite his prickly attitude, Tommy couldn\u2019t be happier to see his friend sitting before him, laughing his ass off.\n\u201cHa ha, very funny. Thanks for scaring the shit out of me, man. When the hell did you get back?\u201d\nDream took a deep breath, finally getting himself under control. \u201cSometime yesterday. I was going to come see you, but you weren\u2019t hanging around any of your usual spots.\u201d\nTommy thought back to last night, chest warm with the memory of sticky hands and hugs. \u201cI was busy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I get it. Tommy Innit is a Big Man now with no time for his best friend-\u201c\nTommy kicked him. \u201cOh shut up, you know that\u2019s not true. Why are you here, anyways? I thought you an\u2019 the \u2018Dream Team\u2019\u2013 that\u2019s an \u2018orrible name, by the way\u2013 were gonna be busy with your manhunt or whatever until the end of the month.\u201d\nDream shrugged, scooting over on the bench to make room for him, which Tommy happily took. \u201cSapnap had to go home early, and George insists on getting like, official approval for the game before we make it a big thing, and paperwork is exhausting, so I dipped.\u201d\nTommy nodded in understanding. Dream and his friends had come up with a brilliant idea to create a new sort of challenge tournament, where a designated person had to achieve a certain goal while the rest of the team tried to stop the runner of sorts from achieving it. If he was being honest, Tommy didn\u2019t really understand the concept all that well. Apparently, the idea was starting to grow on some people over in the capital, as the classic tournament format somehow wasn\u2019t appealing enough these days. Tommy thought it was a stupid idea, but he\u2019d never say that to Dream\u2019s face.\n(And his opinion on the new sport had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it meant Dream was always off at the Capital these days. Absolutely none.)\n\u201cSo, Tommy,\u201d Dream said, slinging an arm around his shoulders. \u201cHow\u2019d you get into the tournament, anyways? Not that I don\u2019t think that you could beat half the people here in a heartbeat-\u201c\n\u201cI was trained by one of the best, after all,\u201d Tommy cut in, poking Dream in the side with a grin.\nDream laughed. \u201cOf course. But they like, never let teens into the tournament, much less someone without a reputation to their name.\u201d\n\u201cLike you?\u201d\nDream rolled his eyes. \u201cI did not have a reputation.\u201d\nTommy scoffed. \u201cYou were winning small duels for years, even beating some of the city guards at their own game. Of course they were gonna let you in, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not like I won-\u201c\n\u201cYeah, you waited a couple years to do that. Youngest person ever. Are you done making shit excuses now?\u201d\nDream ruffled his hair, smiling. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll stop talking.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cBut really, how\u2019d you get in?\u201d\nTommy stood, puffing out his chest, hands on his hips. \u201cI am absolutely poggers, an\u2019 therefore the desk guy took one look at me and decided that I must be allowed to compete at all costs, for the sake of everything ever.\u201d\nDream raised an eyebrow at him, a skeptical smirk on his face. \u201cOh, really now?\u201d\nTommy hesitated for a split second.\n\nNo, actually. One of the members of my family that is made up of mythical deities actually blessed me with a temporary gift of his siren powers so I could charm my way in. Isn\u2019t that cool?\n\nBut he had never actually told Dream about Wilbur, Techno, and Phil, as much as he wanted to sometimes. Because Tommy also didn\u2019t want his closest friend to think he was legitimately insane, it was therefore kept a secret. So Tommy didn\u2019t tell the truth, settling for an \u201cOf course, bitch!\u201d instead.\nDream rolled his eyes playfully, standing up as well. \u201cI should\u2019ve known, only you would be able to weasel your way into something like this with the force of your personality alone.\u201d\nA bell rang, the clanging cutting through the din of the room, and everyone fell silent. \u201cThe first round begins in five minutes!\u201d someone called, before the chatter sprang back up, the energy in the room growing tenfold.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Dream said, giving his shoulder a squeeze. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue. I\u2019ll be up in the stands, cheering you on.\u201d\nTommy cocked his head. \u201cNot gonna wipe the floor with the rest of us, Dream?\u201d\nDream smiled, shaking his head. \u201cNah, not this year. I\u2019ll let you do the honors.\u201d\nHe reached out and pulled Tommy in for a hug, one Tommy gladly reciprocated. \u201cGood luck, Tommy,\u201d he murmured into his hair, giving an extra tight squeeze. \u201cStay safe out there, alright?\u201d\nTommy chuckled, giving his friend a reassuring pat on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Big D. I\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\nDream pulled away, ruffling his hair one last time before disappearing into the crowd, off to join the cheering masses in the stands. Tommy readjusted his trusty iron sword, making sure it was secure in the belt around his waist. He shook out his hands, nerves and the thrill of adrenaline singing through his blood.\nIt was time for the first round, and Tommy was ready.\nDodging a few people, Dream made his way to the front row of seats, wanting to be as close to the railing and the action as possible. He found an empty bench, plopping down with a contented sigh, excited to watch Tommy compete.\nThe kid had been so happy to see him, despite how much Tommy had tried to hide it. Honestly, Dream had been relieved when Tommy started cussing him out just like always. Maybe part of him had been worried that Tommy would resent him for being gone so long.\nHe sighed, resting his elbows on the rail in front of him, waiting for the gates to open up to let the competitors in. Sure, he wasn\u2019t actually Tommy\u2019s family, but sometimes it felt like they were close enough to be one. And leaving the kid all on his own\u2026 well, it kinda sucked.\nDream had actually only known Tommy for a couple of years, had stumbled upon him on one of the many rooftops of the city and been cursed at with such skill he couldn\u2019t help but be amazed. He bit back at the foul-mouthed kid, delighted by how well Tommy could fire off insults and jokes, and the rest was history.\nAnother bell rang, and the gates to the arena lifted, letting the flood of competitors through. Dream picked out Tommy easily, blond hair excitedly bobbing above much of the crowd, probably chattering away by the weird looks and space the others readily gave.\nSnickering to himself, he couldn\u2019t help but imagine how weirded out everyone must be, unused to dealing with one Tommy Innit while the kid was in performance mode.\n\nThose poor, poor souls have no idea what\u2019s going to hit them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\nDream jumped, turning his attention away from the competitors down below to the stranger sitting on the bench beside him. For a split second, confusion took over as he failed to remember the guy arriving in the first place. He brushed it off quickly though, blaming his own focus on Tommy for the lack of observation.\nUnusually red eyes stared at him from behind wire-frame glasses, waiting patiently for an answer.\nChuckling awkwardly, Dream waved a hand. \u201cOh- nothing, just laughing at my friend acting like an idiot and probably bothering the hell out of everyone here.\u201d He laughed again, more sincere this time. \u201cBut then again, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less. He\u2019s kinda a little shit.\u201d\nThe man hummed, nodding agreeably. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely somethin\u2019 I can relate to.\u201d\nThey both laughed, a camaraderie easily found in mutual exasperation at the idiocy of others.\nCurious, Dream studied the guy. The stranger seemed relaxed, sitting with a manner that radiated self-assurance, but there was something else, an underlying sense of danger. \nSomething just felt\u2026 off.\nAnd really the longer Dream looked, the more peculiar the stranger became. He was wearing a green-striped bucket hat, but it was low on his head, as if the man were trying to hide all of his hair underneath it. Despite this, pink wisps escaped around his ears. And not only that, but the hat didn\u2019t match with the rest of the outfit, like\u2026 at all.\nThe white poet\u2019s shirt tucked into high-waisted pants gave off a completely different vibe, not to mention the red sash around his waist that horrendously clashed with the green.\n(Tommy would definitely tell him that Dream, of all people, was not allowed to critique the fashion sense of others, but come on- this was just bad.)\n\u201cUh, nice outfit you got there,\u201d Dream said casually, hoping it came off as less rude and more confused, because it honestly was.\nThe guy smiled, the look abnormally sharp. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 out a more modern look.\u201d\nDream smiled thinly.\n\nIf your idea of modern is from 200 years ago, then sure. It works.\n\nThe conversation paused for a moment as rules for the first round were announced, the announcer\u2019s voice echoing throughout the arena. Dream watched as panels in the floor opened, raising wooden pieces for the first challenge from beneath the sand.\nThe man cleared his throat. \u201cSo, I\u2019m assumin\u2019 you\u2019ve got someone particular to root for, then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied proudly, watching as Tommy lined up with the others. \u201cAnd he\u2019s going to win, too.\u201d\nThe man barked out a laugh, shaking his head as he leant back with arms crossed, red eyes gleaming. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure. I\u2019ve got bets placed on my own guy.\u201d \nYeah, but I\u2019ve got Tommy, Dream thought, pushing down the smug urge to brag about the kid.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said instead, a bit of bite to the words. \u201cMay the best man win, then.\u201d\nThe stranger grinned over at him. \n\u201cMay the best man win.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTommy pushed his way to the middle of the group, careful not to get skewered by a stray spear or wayward sword. That would just be unfortunate and incredibly inconvenient.\nA second bell rang, and the iron gates keeping them all in the room lifted, opening the way into the arena. The flow of people pushed Tommy out, blinking into the sunlight as the roar of the crowd washed over him. Packed sand crunched beneath his boots, sandstone walls reaching up to the sky, caging in a perfect circle of blue. More banners hung from the rails, bright in the sun, and the whole arena lay empty before him.\nBasically, the arena was fucking awesome.\n\u201cHoly shit this is cool,\u201d he murmured aloud, full of wonder. \nTommy watched the tournaments every year, but being in the stands is one thing. Being on the actual arena floor is another.\nOfficials prompted the group to spread out along the wall, keeping the arena floor clear. \n\u201cWonder what they\u2019re having us do,\u201d a lady next to him wondered.\n\u201cNot sure, they don\u2019t even have anything laid out yet,\u201d another person answered.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably have us do a sandcastle building competition,\u201d Tommy said offhandedly, still trying to take the sight in. \u201cI mean, why the else would they give us all this fuckin\u2019 sand?\u201d\nThe two people fell silent, staring at him before exchanging glances. \u201cHow old are you again?\u201d The lady asked, skeptical.\n\u201cOld enough to destroy everyone here, bitch,\u201d Tommy declared. \u201cOh look, they\u2019re giving us things!\u201d\nAlong the line, competitors were being handed what looked like a belt, with three flags hanging off of it, one in green, one in yellow, and one in red. \n\nAh, yes. Gotta preserve the theme.\n\nTommy took his, quickly looping around his waist and tugging the belt tight. He fiddled with the flags, liking the way the fabric flowed between his fingers.\nA booming voice began to speak, and Tommy snapped to attention, eager to figure out what the challenge was going to be.\nCapture the flag, perhaps? A relay race? An eating contest but they ate the sand?\n(Wil would\u2019ve been very pleased by that one.)\n\u201cWelcome, competitors, to the Tournament of the Gods! The first round will commence in a moment, once all rules have been announced.\u201d\nTommy rocked back and forth on his heels, wanting them to just get to the point already.\n\u201cYour first challenge will be\u2026 the Labyrinth! Each competitor must navigate the wooden maze with the utmost skill and speed-\u201c\nAs the announcer continued to speak, there was a loud creaking of machinery and hinges, and sections of the floor lowered, sand trickling into the holes from the edge. Tommy watched in awe as a minute later, wooden walls pushed up from the floor, constructing an elaborate maze in front of his eyes.\nHe had seen the extent of the arena\u2019s technology before, but they hadn\u2019t done anything this elaborate in years. With a final clang, the last section of floor slid into place, a flagpole flying three banners rising up from the very center of the maze.\n\u201cThe goal of each contestant is to reach the center of the maze as quickly as possible. However, sabotage of other competitors is allowed. Each person has been given a belt containing three flags, one to represent each of our beloved deities.\u201d\nTommy glanced around, finding this to be true. He made note of how the others had tied their flags, some around the waist, some around the chest, even one weirdo who wore his like a necklace.\n\u201cContestants are allowed to take these flags from one another once the event begins. No points will be awarded for gaining extra flags, however, anyone who loses all three at any point during the round will be eliminated.\u201d\nRight away, Tommy took a few steps away from the people next to him, just in case anyone wanted to get grabby from the get-go.\n\u201cThe first fifty to either make it to the center flagpole or to remain standing with their flags will move onto the next round of the Tournament. May the gods bless you all.\u201d\nThere was an empty moment in which the officials cleared from the floor, and the iron gates ground back into place. Tommy, like the genius he was, took this time to formulate a plan of action.\nWhat were his advantages here?\nTommy knew he was fast, good for dodging. Luckily, his relative poorness was a good thing, no extra gear or armor to slow him down. If he kept moving, he\u2019d be fine.\nIn short, the plan was to run like hell and hope for the best.\nOverhead, the clanging of a bell rang out, and the round began.\nIt was instant chaos.\nPeople lunged at each other, grabbing for flags. Swords and shields clashed, generally good-natured yells sounding out as people fought. Tommy, along with many others, booked it for one of the many entrances to the maze.\nDark wooden walls soon rose up around him, shielding the glare of the sun as his boots pounded against the sand. A clanging of armor grew loud behind him, and he banked left as quickly as possible, shooting down another row.\nTommy debated drawing his sword to defend against others, but decided against it. If he could make it to the center before the fighting outside the maze calmed down, he would be fine. Most of the people here right now were runners. It was the hunters going for the flag approach that he would have to worry about. \nHe followed a curve of the wall, keeping an ear out for footsteps or the clash of metal. It wasn\u2019t quite midday, and Tommy used that too, watching the shadows changed direction as he took a quick right and skidded around another left, plunging into the heart of the Labyrinth.\nTommy came up to a crossroads, peeking around the corner for any possible threats. He froze for a second, debating where to go. Directions weren\u2019t exactly his forte, but if he took the path directly in front, it should take him more toward the center\u2026\nLost in thought, Tommy didn\u2019t hear the sound of footsteps coming up behind him until the person was practically on top of him.\nA hand reached for the belt at his waist and Tommy scrambled away, out into the center of the crossroads to face them. The guy behind him grinned, pulling out a spear.\n\u201cYou wanna give me that flag, kid?\u201d He teased, eyes narrowing.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Tommy replied, backtracking toward an exit. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep it, so sorry to decline.\u201d\nThe spear guy laughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really asking.\u201d\nHe ran forward, swinging the blunt end of the staff at Tommy, which Tommy quickly ducked, rolling away. While the guy moved, Tommy scooped up a handful of sand and tossed it in his face.\nThere was a cry, and Tommy darted forward, snatching the green flag from the other\u2019s belt. \nStuffing it in his pocket, Tommy danced away, laughing. \u201cNice try, dickhead, but you can\u2019t catch the great-\u201c\nThere was a tug at his waist, and Tommy caught a hand disappearing with his red flag, the woman holding it flashing a grin over her shoulder as she took off down a different path.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fuckin\u2019 rude, lady!\u201d Tommy shouted, watching her retreat.\n\nOkay, taunting others from now on is a no.\n\nHe left the other man alone, moving down the row he had meant to go on in the first place, back on the run.\nTommy kept running, taking different paths and dodging a couple attacks, even managing to snatch one guy\u2019s gold flag as he squeezed past a fight between two other competitors.\nThe sun continued to creep higher, sand baking in the heat between the wooden walls.\nHe hit the first of many dead ends right when the announcers voice echoed through the arena once again, declaring that the first contestant had made it to the center.\nGritting his teeth, Tommy backtracked, scooting out of the way of a wayward crossbow bolt as he went.\nOnly 49 spots left. \nSand caught between his toes, burrowing into his socks as he skidded around another corner, pushing off the wall. Brief skirmishes and fights grew more common, the runners quickly being replaced by hunters, even a couple of teams dedicated to snatching as many flags as possible.\n47 spots left.\nAt one point, Tommy barely threw himself around a corner and out of sight before one such group barreled past, dozens of tri-colored flags in their possession. He held his breath until the swish of sand faded behind wooden planks once again.\n43 spots left.\nThe sun was nearing its peak when his gold flag was snatched. \nTommy had taken another damn wrong turn, having to backtrack again to escape a dead end. Frustrated, he threw up his hands, spinning on his heel to continue going, only to come face to face with another competitor.\nShe grinned at him, before clocking him square in the face with a punch that would make even Dream proud.\nTommy staggered back, cursing loudly as his vision swam. He shook it off quickly though, setting his feet and raising his wrapped fists in a challenge.\nShe took it.\nTommy blocked a punch with his forearm, swinging out with a swift kick to the knee that she managed to dodge. The follow-up elbow to the jaw was a bit more successful.\nShe retreated a step, sizing him up better. Tommy looked for a way around her, not even wanting to try for her flag, mind set on the plan of keep moving and it\u2019ll work out.\nWhen she came in for another attack, Tommy sidestepped, the punch meant for his sternum grazing his side instead. He caught her arm, but was taken off guard by a kick to the shin, and before he could do anything, the yellow flag had been plucked from his belt.\nTommy got her in the chin with the heel of his palm and escaped easily, but now he was down a second flag, left with only the green.\n\nPhil was the best out of the three of them anyway. Who fucking needed Wilbur when he had Phil?\n\n38 spots left.\nThe hunter teams had really become a problem. \nThe cheers of the crowd mingled with the clangs of swords and shields, followed an exasperated shout as someone got their last flag stolen. The sounds bounced around in the maze, further adding to the confusion.\nBut Tommy was getting close, he could tell. There were more dead ends, more false leads, and the flagpole loomed closer with each step he took.\n35 spots left.\nTommy took a left turn, peeling away from a row that just screamed wrong direction. It was a mistake.\nA hunter team turned to look at him, the man at the front of the group easily spotting the lone green flag on Tommy\u2019s belt, face lighting up at the chance to eliminate some more of the competition.\nThey all stared at each other, frozen for a second.\nThen somebody yelled \u201cGet him!\u201d, and the chase was on.\nTommy turned tail and ran, going back the way he came. Footsteps followed close behind, the group calling to him to just give up. Tommy ran faster, ricocheting off of one wall to cut across into another pathway.\nAnother announcement came on.\n34 spots left.\nBreathing ragged from all the sprinting, Tommy fled around another corner, heart wilting in his chest at the sight of the dead end in front of him.\n\nWell fuck, that\u2019s not good.\n\nHe could hear the shouts behind him, the clanging of armor as the group of hunters turned the corner as well, boxing him in.\nTommy spun, raising his hands placatingly. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this one, fellas! No need to get hasty here!\u201d\nThe leader of the group grinned, brandishing his sword. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hand over the flag, kid, and we won\u2019t have a problem, huh?\u201d\nTommy retreated further, back hitting the wood at the end of the path, hand coming down to protect the green flag. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d\nThe leader laughed. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have a problem, won\u2019t we?\u201d\nDesperately, Tommy looked around, trying to think of a plan. He couldn\u2019t get past them, could barely fight off more than two people, much less three or four with only one flag left.\nHe couldn\u2019t run either. Left, right, and his back were blocked off.\nTrapped. \nHe was trapped, utterly boxed in.\nThe only other option was up. The sky was open above him, the last option. It just might work if he-\n\u201cWell? You gonna try to fight, kid?\u201d\nTommy looked back at the group, shooting them a cocky grin as his hand reached for his sword.\n\nDarling, don\u2019t fail me now.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he snarked. \u201cYou\u2019d all lose anyway.\u201d\nWith that, Tommy drew the blade, loving the familiar wash of energy that poured through him at the motion, the hilt fitting in his hand like an old friend. Before anyone had a chance to attack, he spun and plunged the blade in between the planks of the wall, hoping he didn\u2019t skewer anyone unfortunate enough to be on the other side.\nThen, to the startled shouts behind him, Tommy launched himself up the wall, using the blade as a springboard and heaving himself onto the edge. Wobbling a little, Tommy leaned down and yanked the blade from the wall, balancing carefully.\nAll that time spent watching the city from the rooftops really did come in handy.\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d someone shouted, and Tommy gave them all cheeky salute, grinning like a maniac.\n\u201cSorry boys, but I gotta dash. It was lovely meeting you all, hope you bastards all get clobbered on your way to the center.\u201d\nAnd with that, Tommy took off running, sword still held in his grip, leaping from wall to wall, each step a balancing act, each placement deliberate. \nTommy\u2019s focus made him oblivious to the enthusiastic cheers of the crowd and the stunned competitors below him, looking up in shock as he passed over.\nWhy I didn\u2019t think to do this shit from the start, Tommy thought, a triumphant grin on his face as the center of the maze came into view. I have no idea.\nThe flagpole gleamed in the sun, and Tommy couldn\u2019t help but laugh to himself as he made a wild leap off of the final wall, slamming into it and sliding all the way down to the ground with a thump.\nCatching his breath, Tommy flopped onto his back in the sand, grinning. It was hot as hell from the sun and going to get all over in his hair, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to give a shit.\n\nHe\u2019d done it.\n\nThe sun was blocked out by other competitors leaning over to look down at him, expressions a variety of begrudgingly impressed, confused, and somewhat pissed.\nSo really, the typical reaction to anything Tommy had ever done in life.\nWith a quiet groan, he sat back up, brushing the sand from his clothes. \u201c\u2018Ello, everyone,\u201d he chirped, smiling. \u201cIt seems I made it, eh?\u201d\nAnother announcement boomed overhead. \u201cAnd 17th to enter the center is competitor Tommy Innit!\u201d\nThe crowd erupted into excited cheers, even louder than it had been before.\nUnbeknownst to Tommy, Dream and Techno stood next to each other, cheering the loudest of all.\nThe clanging of machinery was still echoing out from the arena when Dream left the stands, already on his way to meet the victorious fifty before the maze had even retreated back underground. As he dashed down the sand stone steps, the sight of Tommy literally walking on top of the maze kept playing in his head, the cheers of the crowd still ringing in his ears. He smiled to himself.\nAfter the moment had passed, Dream had even turned to brag to the strange man next to him, to smugly announce Yeah, that\u2019s my kid, but to Dream\u2019s surprise, the guy had vanished, unnoticed just the way he came.\nHe had shrugged it off and continued watching the competition, excited to see what followed Tommy\u2019s dramatic play.\nNow, Dream fought his way to the main doors, taking the familiar path around back to the contestants\u2019 entrance. Once successfully free of the crowd, he stationed himself right outside, leaning casually in the shade provided by the wall, hiding from the blazing noon-day sun. Others followed, taking up similar positions while they waited for their own respective family or friends to emerge, or for a chance to see their favorites up close.\nSoon enough, the bell rang once again, officially signaling the end of the first round and the hour long break the contestants would have before the second challenge began. The whole area broke into cheers as the players flooded out, either waving enthusiastically and grinning in triumph, or slumping their way out in defeat.\nDream held back a snicker as he watched a man burst into tears, his friend giving a consoling pat on the arm with a rather disinterested look that just screamed \u201cWell, you tried.\u201d Honestly, watching grown people throw a fit over this competition because they lost a chance to impress some ancient deities was entertaining in and of itself.\nHe resettled himself against the wall, knowing damn well Tommy was going to take his sweet ass time. \nSee, Dream wasn\u2019t big on the whole Almighty Gods, please bless us because we have honored you with our petty human fights schtick. Sure, maybe there was some all-knowing being out there with the power to enchant you or control death itself. And sure, maybe gods did in fact like when people honored them. But come on. \nThere was no way the gods (if they existed at all) would waste their time watching some competition that ran year after year, simply for the sake of upholding a human tradition. No immortal being was going to follow the whims of some desperate, obsessed person with a sword and an ego. Like, that makes zero sense. \nThe flow of people leaving the arena fell to a trickle, and finally Dream caught sight of Tommy. A wheeze escaped at the sight of the kid.\nHe was absolutely plastered with sand, cheeks already a little pink with sunburn and sporting a wicked bruise on one side, and a lunatic grin to match. Tommy practically bounced along, waving his hands about enthusiastically as he chatted with some rando. A random man who was crazy enough to be wearing a beanie, of all things, at a time like this.\nDream narrowed his eyes, stepping out of the shade. This guy wasn\u2019t bothering Tommy, was he?\nFrom personal experience, Dream knew all too well the backhanded-attention that could come from pulling a ballsy move in the arena, especially when one was just an impressionable kid. The competition could be ruthless, but jealous supporters of a fellow contestant even more so.\n\u201cYo, Tommy! Over here!\u201d\nThe kid\u2019s head snapped over, grin widening even further at the sight of Dream waving to him. The kid waved back, turning to say something to crazy beanie man before breaking away and rushing over.\nDream watched the man walk away with suspicion. But before he could really worry, Dream blinked and the guy had vanished from sight, presumably swallowed up by the masses.\n\u201cBig D, my man! Did you see me absolutely wreck \u2018em all? Did you? This one guy was all like \u2018We\u2019re gonna have a problem\u2019 meh meh meh- an\u2019 I totally escaped!\u201d\nPulling his attention back to Tommy, Dream smiled, knowing full well the burst of pride he had felt when watching Tommy launch onto that wall was showing. \u201cI did see. You absolutely destroyed them, kid.\u201d\nTommy waved his hands about, still excitedly retelling the events of the first round despite Dream\u2019s assurance that he had seen it all. \u201c-And when I jumped at the end-! You should\u2019ve seen their faces,\u201d the kid cackled, eyes lighting up with delight. \u201cI was just lying in the sand like, \u2018Sup Bitches! And they had no clue how to react! Priceless, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\nDream watched, fond. Tommy\u2019s rambling died down, and the kid finally stopped to take a breath, heaving in air. Dream tipped his head toward a few of the trees still scattered about the arena in a silent invitation. Tommy nodded eagerly, probably overjoyed at a chance to escape the sun for a moment.\nHe slung an arm around the teen\u2019s shoulders. Dream ignored the curious looks shot their way, the onlookers either interested in the upstart of this year\u2019s competition, or recognizing the former champion at his side.\nThey reached the shade, and Dream pulled a water bottle from the hoodie tied around his waist, having taken the thing off long ago. He offered, and Tommy gratefully accepted it before taking a seat.\nDream settled down in the grass , watching Tommy practically inhale the drink. \u201cNice bruise you\u2019ve got there. Let your guard down?\u201d\nTommy stopped chugging for a second to groan dramatically. \u201cThat lady came out of nowhere, Dream. You wouldn\u2019t believe it- one second I\u2019m navigating the wooden death trap like a fuckin\u2019 pro, the next she\u2019s decking me unprompted. It was rather rude,\u201d he grumbled.\nDream laughed, reaching forward to gently brush off some of the sand stuck to his face. Tommy didn\u2019t even notice, too busy watching the crowd and sipping on his water.\n\u201cAny clue what the next round is? Have they given you guys hints or something?\u201d\nTommy shrugged, emptying the bottle and setting it aside. \u201cNo clue. They really like keeping us in the dark, the bastards.\u201d\nHe hummed, understanding perfectly.\nWith a groan, Tommy flopped back onto the ground, claiming Dream\u2019s outstretched legs as a pillow. \u201cNo one bothered to tell me how fuckin\u2019 exhausting this shit is. They ought to put a disclaimer or something.\u201d\nDream smiled wryly. \u201cWhat, \u2018if you\u2019re not in shape don\u2019t join\u2019? I think that one\u2019s implied, Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cWell I get that,\u201d the kid scoffed, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, they could\u2019ve like- told me I was going to have to actually try.\u201d\nA surprised laugh burst out of him at the genuine annoyance in that statement, head tipping back as he shook with the force of it. \n\nGods forbid Tommy Innit needs to put in effort-\n\nDream sucked in a breath, trying to get a grip, but one glance at the sour look on Tommy\u2019s face sent him right back into hysterics.\nTommy smacked at him. \u201cOi! Stop that!\u201d\nHe just laughed harder, dissolving into wheezing chuckles as Tommy glared up at him, the kid obviously fighting incredibly hard to hold back a smile of his own.\n\u201cGods, Tommy,\u201d Dream said, wiping tears from his eyes. \u201cSay it any louder and you might offend someone. There are people who actually do train for this, you know that, right?\u201d\nThere was a dismissive wave. \u201cLosers, the lot of them.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Dream flicked his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I trained for it too, so watch your mouth, you insolent child.\u201d\nTommy shook his head. \u201cNope. You\u2019re too good to do things like train. You were obviously born with natural talent, like me.\u201d\nHe snorted, running a hand through the kid\u2019s hair, unsurprised by the amount of sand that shook out. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cMhm.\u201d \nTommy\u2019s eyes closed, taking a moment to relax as the adrenaline from the first round finally worked its way out of his system.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Dream nudged him. \u201cDon\u2019t go falling asleep on me, you\u2019ve still got another round today.\u201d\nTommy grumbled, but Dream knew full well how excited Tommy truly was to complete in round two.\n\u201cSpeaking of, need any equipment? I don\u2019t have a whole lot here anymore, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got at least a better sword lying around somewhere-\u201c\nTommy\u2019s eyes flicked open, squinting up at him. A hand protectively reached for the worn silver hilt at his side. \u201cDon\u2019t insult my beloved like that, you bitch.\u201d\nDream cocked an eyebrow at that one. \u201cYour beloved?\u201d\n\u201cYes. She is my darling an\u2019 I will not tolerate any slander in this establishment. My sword is perfectly fuckin\u2019 fine, thank you very much,\u201d Tommy said, adamant. If Dream didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d think the kid was personally offended.\nHands raised in surrender, he glanced down at the weapon, curious. \u201cWhere\u2019d you even get that from, anyways? I know you\u2019ve had it for years, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked.\u201d\nFor a split second, Tommy seemed to hesitate, as if he were choosing his words carefully. \u201cA friend,\u201d he finally decided, nodding to himself. \u201cIt was a gift.\u201d\n\u201cMust be a nice gift, I\u2019m honestly surprised it didn\u2019t break when you jumped on it.\u201d\nTommy hummed happily, giving the sword a loving pat. \u201cShe\u2019s unbreakable. Infallible. My beloved.\u201d\nDream sighed playfully, going back to messing with the kid\u2019s hair. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Tommy. Whatever you say.\u201d\nThey sat together, enjoying the shade and making up for missed time until the bell pealed once again, and Dream was forced to retreat back to the stands.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d The Siren said, pulling the beanie from his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of that one, oh Mighty Blood God?\u201d\nHe let go of the hat with a flick of his wrist, the thing vanishing with a muffled snap and a flash of light. The god turned to Techno, waiting for a response.\nThe idiot in question was still dressed up in his so called \u201cmortal disguise\u201d, much to Wilbur\u2019s delight. Techno was obviously very proud of it, and Phil had been happy to give up his prized bucket hat for the cause. As the one who spent the most time intermingling with those of the mortal plane, however, Wilbur knew better than those two. \n(Tommy, much to Phil and Technoblade\u2019s objections, was not, in fact, a decent reference point for the latest fashion trends. The kid dressed like the well-loved street rat he was and Tommy knew it.)\nDespite this, Wilbur had found far too much entertainment that morning in assuring Techno that Yes, you blend right in. No, you don\u2019t look stupid, I am not laughing behind your back. I would never, fuck you.\nThe Blood God\u2019s eyes were currently lit up, a fiery mix of pride and the flame of competitiveness burning within. Techno grinned. \u201cHe absolutely killed it out there, Wilbur. Smoked \u2018em. Completely obliterated the competition. I haven\u2019t seen someone pull something like that in years.\u201d\nWilbur scoffed, sitting down on nothingness, the otherworldly properties of their realm easily manipulated to suit his needs. \u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t watched the tournament in years, Techno. Of course you haven\u2019t seen anything of interest.\u201d\nTechno ignored him, pacing excitedly about in the blinding space, pops of pink, red, and gold swirling at his feet with each step. \u201cThat move he pulled at the end, he used his sword to do it! In such a clever way too...\u201d\nWilbur rolled his eyes good-naturedly at the awe in Techno\u2019s voice. \u201cTommy hasn\u2019t let that thing out of his sight since you gave it to him, man. Of course he was gonna use it.\u201d\n\u201cBut Wilbur, it\u2019s the principle of the thing-\u201c\n\u201cYeah, yeah, Tommy is using the sword, we all know you\u2019re his favorite. You can shut up now.\u201d\nTechno stopped pacing, quickly fixing him with a deadpan look. \u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019, right?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\nNow it was the other god\u2019s turn to roll his eyes. \u201cWilbur, we obviously all know you\u2019ve been the kid\u2019s favorite since you found him, years ago. Enough with the jealousy already. Green looks ugly on you.\u201d\nLike the very mature and ancient being he was, Wilbur stuck his tongue out in response. At the same time, he sat privately relishing in the dark feeling curling in his chest at the idea of being securely Tommy\u2019s favorite. He was the one to find Tommy, and Tommy was theirs- his, to care about.\nYou\u2019d think Tommy would be the one offering up his devotion to them, begging for their attention, but it had always been the other way around with their little family. The whole thing had always struck Wilbur as a tad ironic, and he loved Tommy even more for it. It was just another part of the Innit charm.\n\u201cAnway,\u201d Techno continued. \u201cWilbur- listen. So I sat down to watch, right? And I was all prepared to be a good sport, ready to even make small talk, if you would believe it. But then, there was this guy in the stands-\u201c\n\u201cAwe,\u201d Wil cooed. \u201cDid Techno make friends? Has he finally stopped trying to be a Tommy-attention stealer and actually interact with the mortals instead?\u201d\nTechno flicked a finger, and the invisible bench supporting Wilbur\u2019s weight vanished, sending him tumbling to the ground with a burst of yellow and blue and a cry. With dignity, Wilbur stood, brushing off his robes. There was a snort of laughter at the action, which he ignored. That trick was centuries old, and he refused to be bothered by it. Absolutely not.\n\u201cCan I continue now?\u201d\n\u201cPrick,\u201d Wilbur muttered, but graciously allowed the other to carry on.\n\u201cAs I was sayin\u2019, some human next to me in the stands-\u201c\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you actually sat with them,\u201d Wilbur interrupted again. \u201cI mean, what would the poor humans do if they knew the great Blood God actually walked among them-\u201c\n\u201cAre you finished?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, no.\u201d Wilbur snarked, absent-mindedly building energy behind him to lean against. \u201cAnd your outfit is actually atrocious, by the way. Can\u2019t believe you got away with that at all, if I\u2019m honest-\u201c\nA blade materialized at his throat, humming with a swirling, scarlet power. \u201cInsult my outfit again and we\u2019re gonna have problems, Wilbur.\u201d\nWilbur rolled his eyes at the old threat. \u201cWe both know that won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Techno shrugged, \u201cBut we also both know that it\u2019ll at least get you to shut up for one single minute so I can finish tellin\u2019 my story.\u201d\nWith a sigh, Wilbur pushed the dagger away from his face, the thing fizzling away in a mess of red sparks. \u201cFine,\u201d he conceded, waving Techno on. \u201cIf you must.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Techno huffed. \u201cAnyways, this guy I was sittin\u2019 by and I got to talking-\u201c Techno pointed an accusing finger at him. \u201cNo jokes this time.\u201d\nWilbur widened his eyes innocently, remaining silent.\n\u201cSo I ask this guy- who by the way has got to have the worst fashion sense of any mortal I have ever seen- if he\u2019s rootin\u2019 for somebody specific, right? And he goes \u2018Yeah, and he\u2019s gonna win.\u2019\u201d Techno smiled something wicked, the look mirrored on Wilbur\u2019s own face. The Blood God laughed. \u201cAs if, Tommy\u2019s already won, practically.\u201d\nWilbur snickered, imagining the look on the faces of the audience if they knew that their scrawny street boy was already... sponsored, per s\u00e9. \u201cThat is pretty funny.\u201d\nAt that, a mischievous glint appeared in Techno\u2019s eyes, signaling that a plan of war already begun to hatch. Wilbur pitied the poor soul who would be on the receiving end.\n\u201cSay,\u201d Techno began, slowly. \u201cWanna come watch the next round in mortal form with me? I\u2019ll bet that weirdo is probably sitting in the same spot again.\u201d\nWilbur grinned. \u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nDream settled back down in his previous spot, excitement for the next round already taking over. As he waited, leg bouncing, he watched the officials down below scrambling to finish last minute preparations.\nThere was a creaking of ancient wood, and he glanced to the side, unsurprised to see that the guy who woke up this morning in the 1800\u2019s was back once again. Much more surprising, though, was the person sitting next to him.\nThe Crazy Beanie Man had made a reappearance, apparently. \nOf course, Dream scoffed internally. Of course they\u2019re together. Too bad they\u2019re both gonna have to watch their guy lose to Tommy-\nHis righteous inner monologue was interrupted by the clearing of a throat, and Dream spared another glance for the beanie guy.\n\u201cThat hoodie is fucking horrendous, just so you know.\u201d\nDream blinked.\nThe guy then simply nodded at him and settled back in his seat, the insult apparently all he had wanted to say. \nWhat the hell.\nDream opened his mouth to say something, to make a burning comeback, but the announcers voice crackled over the system, stealing his chance.\nWhatever. \nTommy was better than them anyway.\nThe last of the wraps on his hands came loose, and Tommy let out the tiniest sigh of satisfaction at the sensation. While they had been immensely helpful during the first round, the sweat-sand-cloth combo was no longer a comfortable one. He set the material aside, subtly watching the room as he did.\nThere were far fewer people this round, for obvious reasons, but that only made the competition more personal. Tommy, with mixed feelings, noted that multiple looks had been thrown his way during the wait for the next round, and even a finger or two pointed. People around him were chattering away, gossiping with one another. (Although if he was honest, some of the conversations were more of thinly-veiled threats or arguments than a simple chat.)\nTommy bristled as another person glanced his way before whispering to the competitor at their side. Sure, it was cool that his awesomeness was being properly recognized- but did everyone have to be so fuckin\u2019 obvious about the staring?\nGods, it\u2019s like no one around here has any manners, He thought, scowling. Shit is outrageous-\nAs if to prove his point, someone slammed into Tommy\u2019s side out of nowhere. He went flying, arms pinwheeling as he narrowly missed a head-on collision with one of the weapons racks before smacking into the ground. Groaning, Tommy pushed up onto his elbows, turning to glare at whatever stupid bitch hadn\u2019t learned about personal space yet.\nBehind him were two guys arguing with one another, one of them waving his arms about like a madman, mid-rant. The other looked less enthusiastic about it, more irritatedly resigned, holding onto his shoulder as if he had just been shoved.\n(Considering the fact that Tommy was currently on the floor, the guy probably had been.)\n\u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d Tommy snapped at them, getting up and dusting himself off. \u201cThe hell was that for?\u201d\nThe maniac shover shot him a glare, one full of a misplaced sense of entitlement. \u201cMind your own business, kid,\u201d he sneered.\nTommy glowered, pissed. A little shove, caught in the crossfire- fine. But he wasn\u2019t a damn kid.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 kid.\u201d\nThe man drew himself up, somehow managing to look down on him despite Tommy being taller. \u201cThose of us truly worthy of the gods\u2019 attention don\u2019t need to deal with brats like you. They do not appreciate you,\u201d the man waved a hand about, encompassing everyone in the room, apparently. \u201cTaking this so lightly. This is not some joke,\u201d he spat. \u201cI, for one, have been blessed, been chosen. I know with certainty-\u201c\n\u201cOh, shut up, old man,\u201d the other, younger guy huffed, rolling out his arm. \u201cJust because you\u2019re forty and still competing doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the chosen one, it just means you suck.\u201d\nTommy choked down a laugh at that.\nThe dickhead glared at them both, but determined they were no longer worth his time. He stuck up his nose and strutted away, muttering under his breath. Tommy kindly flicked off his retreating back.\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d the remaining guy said, turning to him with a sheepish look. \u201cThat dude has been pestering everybody about his \u2018destiny\u2019,\u201d and this was said with mocking airquotes. \u201c-and whatever, and it was getting on my nerves. I believe as much as the next guy, but those try-hard religious folks can really be a pain.\u201d\nBegrudgingly, Tommy cracked a grin, some of the residual anger draining out of him. \u201cYeah, I know the type.\u201d\nThe guy\u2019s eyes lit up a bit at the joke, seemingly excited to be receiving a less rude response than he had previously. He stuck out his hand for a shake. \u201cName\u2019s Quinn. Nice to meet you.\u201d\nTommy studied him for a moment. The man was pretty young, probably about Dream\u2019s age, with light brown hair thrown up in a half-up, half down hairstyle, kind eyes, and an easy smile. In all honesty, Quinn reminded him of an easily excited dog.\n\u201cI\u2019m Tommy,\u201d he finally replied, slowly accepting the shake. \u201cNice to meet you too, I guess. Wasn\u2019t really expecting to be making friends \u2018n shit today, but whatever.\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSo we\u2019re friends, are we?\u201d\nTommy scowled, taking his hand back and crossing his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant and you know it, dickhead.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Quinn teased. \u201cI saw what you did out there with maze challenge. Bold move, Tommy. I could probably use a friend like you, if you\u2019d want.\u201d\n\nHuh.\n\nTommy tipped his head, calculating. \u201cYou suggesting a team-up, Big Man? With me, of all people?\u201d\nQuinn nodded eagerly. Like a golden retriever, truly. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI just thought it was a really impressive move, and, I don\u2019t know-\u201c He leaned in, voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cYou seem cooler than the rest of these people.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s smile widened, happy to let that comment inflate his ego. \u201cIt\u2019s cause I am.\u201d\nQuinn nodded understandably. \u201cI can tell.\u201d\nHe considered it. The guy didn\u2019t seem too bad, but well-\nTommy began to fiddle with his sword, impatience at how long it was taking until the next round starting to get to him. He studied Quinn once more, taking in the hopeful expression on his face. \n\u201cNo.\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s face fell.\nTommy sighed. \u201cNothing personal, my man. I just work alone. A solo act, if you will. A one man extravaganza-\u201c\n\u201cOkay, I get it,\u201d Quinn interrupted politely. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really. I was just curious is all. Best of luck to you, and everything-\u201c\n\u201cYeah, you too, Big Man.\u201d\nJust then there was a loud clanging of bells and the grinding of gears, signaling the official start of the second round as the gates into the arena rose once again.\nTommy wasted little time charging through them, eager to see what awaited them next. Officials corralled them against the arena\u2019s edge once again, and Tommy scanned the setup before them, the pieces for the next challenge already in play. There would be no dramatic reveal this time, and it nearly made the suspense all the worse.\n\u201cWelcome, folks, back to the Tournament of the Gods! Round Two will commence shortly, once the ground rules have been laid.\u201d\nOfficials cleared the area, allowing Tommy his first clear view of the arena. From the center rose a fountain, or something similar in appearance, with large bowls carved of beautifully cut stone, yet it sat dry and empty. Spanning out from this centerpiece were three different sections and structures. A wall, of some sort, surrounded by a sea of glimmering metal, bronze and gold and silver glinting in the light, blinding under the afternoon sun. There was also a strangely uneven span of ground, dark stone plates poking up in a checkerboard-like pattern, all different heights and widths. Finally, there was a pool of water, a small island stranded in the center of it, multicolored strings and strands stretched out over the surface.\n\u201cThe rules of this round are simple enough. This round is dedicated, once again, to our cherished deities: the Blood God, the Siren, and the Angel of Death. Each god has a puzzle that you must unlock in order to succeed in this challenge. Hopefully you know your myths well, challengers-\u201c\nTommy bit down a laugh. I think that\u2019s the one thing I don\u2019t need to be worried about.\n\u201cSolve each puzzle to complete the full picture. Once you have succeeded in this task, you will pass onto the final round. However- there is a catch.\u201d\nMurmurs of excitement shot through the crowd and the competitors alike, waiting to see what the twist would be. Tommy bounced on his heels, fingers curling at his sides in anticipation.\n\u201cThis challenge is a team effort. Each contestant must obtain a partner- either by choice, or random assignment if one is not chosen- and the top eight teams will advance to the finals.\u201d\nInstantly, there were mixed reactions. Groans of frustration mingled with calls to friends, begging for an ally. Tommy frowned, scanning the other 49 around him, trying to decide who would be to his advantage to partner up with. He could handle this just fine on his own, but if he was going to be forced to work with someone, it better be someone good.\nTommy spun on his heel, ignoring the hullabaloo around him, craning his neck to see who was still available. That lady seemed cool enough- no, she was already picked. Ooh! What about- \nDamn. Taken.\nHe was just about to call out to a nice enough looking person to his right when someone tapped him on the shoulder, interrupting the chance. He had a sinking suspicion who it was. \nA quick glance behind affirmed it.\nQuinn, smiling at him with that eager, puppy-dog look, hand once again outstretched. \u201cPlease?\u201d he pleaded, wiggling his fingers, trying to draw Tommy in. \u201cI don\u2019t bite, I promise. Just for this challenge.\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes, but cracked a grin all the same. Could do worse really. I could\u2019ve been stuck with that \u2018chosen one\u2019 bastard from earlier.\n\u201cAlright, Q Man,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cYou have yourself a deal. Welcome to Team Innit.\u201d \n\u201cGlad to be onboard, Tommy.\u201d\nAnd they shook on it.\nAfter the general ruckus had died down, the announcer continued on. \u201cOnce all contestants have received a partner, the next round will commence. Remember, solutions to these puzzles are limited, and fighting is allowed to some extent-\u201c\nTommy adjusted his sword, shaking out his hands and digging his boots into the sand, ready to run. He leaned over to his partner, who was waiting in a similarly impatient fashion. \u201cWhen this shit starts, we go for the middle bit, got it?\u201d\nQuinn glanced at him from the corner of his eye. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d\nTommy shrugged. \u201cJus\u2019 a feeling, is all. Trust me.\u201d\nQuinn studied him for a second. \u201cI either made the right choice in picking you, Tommy,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly, \u201cOr a very bad one. But I\u2019m not very sure which it is yet.\u201d\nAt that, a sharp grin cut across Tommy\u2019s face, the irony of it all terribly, terribly funny. \u201cTrust me, Quinn,\u201d he laughed, setting his sights on the peculiar fountain at the core of the setup. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have made a better fuckin\u2019 choice if you tried.\u201d\n\u201c-May the Gods bless you all!\u201d\nThe bell rang, and the second round began.\n\u00a0\nSand sprayed from beneath his soles as Tommy shot toward the center, Quinn close at his side. The rest of the challengers scattered like leaves in the wind, flicking to different sections, one for each God. Tommy ignored them, eyes set on the fountain in the center.\nSome might call him a fool for not starting out for the obvious puzzles first, but to make this work, one had to think outside the box. If each of those three outer sections were meant to represent Wil, Tech, and Phil, then what was the point of the dry fountain?\nIt had to be there for a reason. Nothing in this challenge was unintentional. \nHe neared the stone base, circling it with little hesitation, eyes peeled for anything of interest. Quinn caught up quickly, hardly even out of breath.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we looking for, kid?\u201d\n\u201cAnything that could possibly tie all this,\u201d Tommy gestured widely at the unfolding chaos around him, \u201cTogether. There\u2019s a reason why this fountain is here.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it has to do with whatever happens when you complete the other puzzles?\u201d Quinn suggested, leaning over to peer inside the empty basin. \u201cLike a final piece to the puzzle.\u201d\nTommy hummed, nodding, as he ran a hand over the carved whorls. \u201cThat would make sense-\u201c \nSomething caught his eye, glimmering in the second tier of the fountain. He squinted up at it, shading his eyes from the sun. Maybe there was water in this thing after all.\n\u201cYo, Q- give me a boost, will ya?\u201d\nQuinn bounced over, readily offering his hands for Tommy to step into. \u201cYou find something?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d he grunted, holding onto the other\u2019s shoulders for balance as he stretched forward, blindly groping about in the second basin. \u201cBut I think-\u201c \nHis fingers brushed against something metallic and smooth, still cool despite the heat of the day, and he latched on, pulling it out. \u201cGot something!\u201d\nQuinn let him down, and the two bent over to study the thing held in Tommy\u2019s hands. It was an intricate golden pendant, suspended upon a matching chain, although the look of the charm itself was odd. The center of the pendant was perfectly round, with three delicate, spindly bits sticking out of it, horizontal to the front face of the pendant. It was almost as if-\n\u201cThere are parts missing!\u201d Quinn observed excitedly, running a hand over the spindles. \u201cI was right! The other puzzles must complete this bit, and once you\u2019ve got all three, they fit together to make one piece. Like the gods- a divine whole!\u201d\n\u201cOne hell of a metaphor,\u201d Tommy muttered, turning the necklace over. He glanced up, scanning about, watching as other players swarmed the three sections around them, still lost to the true objective. For now, anyways. \n\u201cThe rules states that there are limited solutions,\u201d Tommy pointed out, slinging the chain around his neck for safe keeping. \u201cWhich either means that the pieces themselves are limited- or these are.\u201d He tapped the pendant on his chest.\nQuinn nodded, brow creasing. \u201cIf the first scenario is the case, we need to get going. Any particular god you feel like approaching first?\u201d\nTommy pointed a hand over to the wall, surrounded by a glittering sea of metal objects. From here, he could actually make out the carved wings spanning the length of the wall, skulls interlocking the shadowed feathers. \u201cLet\u2019s pay the Angel of Death a visit, shall we?\u201d\nPhil, if you\u2019re watching this, Tommy thought to himself, This intentional because you are, in fact, my favorite.\nTogether they approached the glittering sea, the clattering and clang of metal harsh as others slid over the piles, some rooting through before carelessly tossing the metals aside. There were no fights, teams seemingly content to try to work out the puzzles on their own for the moment. Tommy bypassed them all, waving for Quinn to follow him up to the wall.\nSet into the stone at even intervals were eight golden pieces, each curved and cut from a third of a circle, and inlaid with a glittering emerald. Tommy ran his fingers over it, Quinn hovering just behind.\n\u201cThat fits the pendant, alright,\u201d his teammate breathed, careful to not be overheard. \u201cBut how do we get it out of the wall?\u201d\nA few paces down, a guy stepped up and began to hack at the glossy stone with a dagger, but the blade slipped uselessly off, leaving not even a chip. He tried again, sparks flying as the metal connected, but still nothing happened.\n\u201cWell, not doing shit like that,\u201d Tommy snorted, and Quinn have a quiet chuckle. Tommy took a step back, eyes tracing the carvings in the stone. Quinn disappeared for a moment, but he payed it no mind. Repeating motifs of wings, skulls, and roses were scattered across the surface, shallowly etched into the stone. But directly above the metal piece was a deeper cut, carved into the shape of a feather. A quick glance side to side revealed that a similar carving rested above each piece. \nQuinn reappeared his side, offering up a shining bit of copper, molded into the shape of a feather. They both looked at it, then at the wall, a dawning realization as to what they were looking for.\nThe wall was the lock, and a feather was the key.\nTommy turned back to the glittering ocean in front of them, letting out a low whistle. Hundreds upon hundreds of feathers winked back at them, all shades of blisteringly bright gold and silver, iron and copper. \u201cThis is gonna be a fuckin\u2019 pain in the ass, my friend.\u201d\n\u201cSo do we just... pick through them one by one?\u201d Quinn asked, sounding a little overwhelmed, twirling the one in hand between in his fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019d have time for it all- there\u2019s way too many.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tommy said slowly, leaning back against the wall. \u201cThis is a logic test, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the announcer said that our knowledge of the gods would be helpful, correct?\u201d\n\u201c...Correct.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Tommy drawled, \u201cIf this is meant to represent the Angel of Death, what quality would they give the feathers that best reflects the guy?\u201d\nSilence fell over the pair as they sat, thinking.\nWhat best matches Phil? Tommy wondered, squinting out over the shimmering sea of feathers. Most of this shit is too bright- too flashy. The only reason he wears gold is cause Techno likes to give it to people, bright stuff has never really been his thing\u2026He\u2019s always got the whole shadowy theme going on-\n\u201cI got it!\u201d Tommy suddenly gasped, smacking Quinn on the arm and startling the man. \u201cWe gotta look for the darkest feather we can find- the less shiny the better.\u201d\n\u201cWhy dark?\u201d Quinn asked, trying to follow the line of reasoning. \n\u201cShadows,\u201d Tommy replied simply, making for the nearest pile and diving in, pushing an armload aside with a satisfying tinkling of feathers. \u201cDeath is subtle, right? Lurks in the shadows, waits for when you least expect it. Find something... I dunno- shadowy or some shit.\u201d\nQuinn nodded, splitting up to search through his own pile. The clinking-clattering of metal faded into the background soon enough, molded feathers cascading down in priceless waterfalls as competitors sifted through, searching for just the right one. Some approached the wall, trying a feather or two, only to toss it back in frustration when it didn\u2019t fit the slot.\nThe sun dipped a little lower, and sweat dropped down Tommy\u2019s back, fingers a bit numb from the heat of the metal beneath his hands. Across the arena, shouts broke out, metal clashing against metal as a fight began, either frustration taking hold or jealousy over another\u2019s success. \nTommy scowled, pushing over another pile of feathers, blinking away the blinding spots in his vision. Maybe he had been wrong. Maybe they should\u2019ve been searching in the shadows, rather than for them. He huffed, pulling the hem of his shirt up to wipe the sweat sticking to his forehead.\n\u201cYo, Tommy!\u201d\nHis head snapped up, and he saw Quinn sprinting toward him, a wide grin on his face, hair half fallen out of its previous neat style. A dark, gunmetal grey feather was held aloft in his hand, held triumphantly overhead as his teammate slipped and slid over the piles of useless metal.\nTommy\u2019s hopes picked up, and the heat was promptly forgotten in the excitement.\nOther players noticed too, stopping their sorting or even beginning to chase after Quinn. \n\u201cFaster Big Man!\u201d Tommy shouted, drawing his sword, a breath of relief escaping as a rush of coolness swamped his limbs, tenseness relaxing. He moved to meet his teammate half way. \u201cI\u2019ll cover you, just fuckin\u2019 run!\u201d\nQuinn did as he was told, heading straight for the wall as Tommy covered his back, sword held high, the glint in his eye challenging anyone to try and take their feather.\nNo one did, although the scramble for the correct one grew more frantic as some of the teams working this puzzle finally realized just what it was they were looking for.\nBehind him, the was a satisfying click, and Tommy glanced over his shoulder just in time to catch Quinn slotting the feather into place.\nIt was a perfect fit.\nAnother click, a few pops, and the golden piece fell out into Quinn\u2019s waiting hands. Tommy dropped his guard, moving closer and carefully pulling the pendant from his shirt, watching as Quinn held the new piece up, carefully slotting it onto the first of the three spindles. It slid into place like magic, melding with the original piece as if they had never been apart at all.\nSilently, Tommy held up a fist, which\nQuinn happily bumped back, laughing airily. \u201cOne down, two to go?\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Tommy agreed, dropping the pendant back down his shirt and safely out of sight. \u201cYour choice this time, you\u2019ve fuckin\u2019 earned it, dude.\u201d\nQuinn pushed the hair out of his face, running a hand across his forehead. \u201cWhat about that one?\u201d He nodded in the direction of the island, where they could see people striding through waist-deep water, or searching diligently over the island. \u201cI could go for a swim right now, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d\nTommy clapped him on the back. \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nSoon after traveling their way to the flooded section of the arena, Tommy had pegged who it was meant to be for.\nWilbur.\nThe Siren.\nGod of music, charisma, and manipulation. Some claimed that he was also the god of the sea, but Tommy knew otherwise. \n(Sure, the name was a little misleading on that part, but what\u2019s a millennia old god supposed to do about that? Wilbur enjoyed messing with people far too much to care about a misleading legend or two anyway.)\nThey slipped through the loose wall\nof string anchored at the water\u2019s edge, watching curiously as other players waded through the water, a canopy of strings made of hundreds of different colors stretched above their heads. They were searching through the water, messing with the strings, and some were even trying to climb the island, but the steep sides seemed to be of little help in that endeavor.\n\u201cAny clue who this one fits?\u201d Quinn asked, reaching up and plucking a string, watching the tremor travel down the line. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Tommy said, sitting down and pulling off his boots. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta do with Siren, I know that much. Not sure besides that.\u201d He stuck his feet the water, uncaring that his socks were getting wet, as the coolness was far more worth it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d Quinn murmured, still plucking at random strings, trying to figure it out.\nTommy slid all the way into the water, scanning for any sign of the next piece. \u201cI\u2019m heading over to the island,\u201d he called over his shoulder, wading in. \u201cI\u2019ll check there, you keep looking, see if there\u2019s any clues around the edge.\u201d\n\u201cGot it!\u201d \nTommy pushed through the water, ducking around other players with heads bent in concentration over something or other. A loud splash to his left drew his attention, and he scrambled forward just in time to miss three people falling face-first into the water, grappling over something shiny in one player\u2019s hands.\n(He still got swamped though. Bastards.)\nSo someone must\u2019ve figured it out over here, too, Tommy mused, approaching the little island. Once near it, he could make out the murky gold shapes underneath the surface of the water, and he plugged his nose, ducking under quickly to get a look. Eyes open beneath the surface, Tommy found the one of the next pieces sitting behind a clear pane of glass, loose inside. The glass followed the entire height of the island, disappearing above the surface, presumably reaching up to where the strings sprouted from the top. A silver cord was tied around the next piece, following the path of the glass.\nTommy pushed back out of the water, shaking the wet hair out of his face. He squinted up at the strings above him, tracing their path overhead, barely able to pick out a glimmering silver among the goldenrods, magentas and turquoise, hidden among scarlets and deep violet. He quickly circled the little island, ducking under an arm and dodging someone\u2019s submerged feet, noting that two of the eight glass chutes were already empty. The code had been cracked, that was for sure.\nWith this information in mind, he began to run back over to where he could see Quinn kneeling on the edge of the pool, splashing his way loudly as he went. Someone yelled at him as he passed, probably for soaking them, but Tommy didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he panted, flopping his arms onto the sand by Quinn\u2019s feet and leaning against the wall of the pool as he caught his breath. \u201cThe next piece is trapped behind some glass \u2018n shit, but there\u2019s a silver string tied to it. Somehow, we gotta use the string to like- fish the bit out. Somebody\u2019s already gotten to them, though.\u201d\nQuinn listened intently, nodding once Tommy finished his explanation. \u201cMakes sense. I checked around the edge while you were, uh\u2026swimming,\u201d he glanced at Tommy\u2019s soaked (and now sandy) appearance, stifling a laugh. \u201cAnd there\u2019s these buttons beneath the sand where the strings lead into the ground. Not sure what they\u2019re for, though.\u201d\nTommy pushed up out of the water. \u201cShow me.\u201d\nQuinn brushed aside the sand where the strings were anchored, revealing little indents set into the ground. He mindlessly pushed a few, but nothing happened. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Tommy muttered.\n\u201cYou said the string was silver, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Quinn wondered, \u201cWe need to find the silver string first, then try the buttons? It could be a way to un-anchor the string, then you just-\u201c he mimed a reeling motion. \u201cYank the piece out. You know?\u201d\nTommy stood, not even bothering to wipe the sand now caked to much of his front. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of strings to look through, though. We need another short cut, like last time.\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWell, you said some people already have the piece, which means two of the strings have been pulled-\u201c\nTommy snapped his fingers, picking up on the logic. \u201cSo find the gaps, space out the interval between the setup-\u201c\n\u201cAnd we find the right string,\u201d Quinn finished excitedly. \u201cExactly.\u201d\nBehind them, there was an outraged scream as the fight taking place in the water was finally resolved, and a team burst out of the pond, tripping over the strings as they fled to another section.\n\u201c\u2026We should probably hurry though.\u201d\n\u201cPractically read my mind, Big Man.\u201d\nFinding a silver string didn\u2019t take long, but Tommy could feel the timer ticking down. A quick survey of the arena proved that at least two other teams had come up with the same strategy as they had, and that wasn\u2019t even mentioning the other sections. For a brief moment, he popped his head out of the string canopy, and noted that three feathers now glimmered in the wall to their left instead of just one.\nTommy ducked back down as Quinn brushed aside the sand covering the buttons at the base of the silver cord. Tommy knelt beside him, poking at one experimentally. To both their surprises, a quiet note sprung out, slightly crunchy and distorted, but a note all the same.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s new,\u201d Quinn remarked.\nTommy pressed more buttons, noting that each emitted a different pitch than the last, although not exactly in order.\n\u201cSiren is the god of music,\u201d Tommy commented, pressing the final button. \u201cMakes sense they\u2019d tie that into this string thing somehow.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you think they chose silver, anyway? Isn\u2019t Siren\u2019s color meant to be gold?\u201d\nTommy shrugged, pressing the buttons over again, listening to where each pitch was located. \u201cMaybe something to do with a silver tongue? He\u2019s the god of charisma, after all, and these officials seem fond of their dumb metaphors.\u201d\nQuinn squinted at him, a curious expression on his face. \u201c\u2026For someone who doesn\u2019t seem like the biggest believer in the gods, you sure know a lot about them.\u201d\nSomething felt a little funny in Tommy\u2019s chest at that, almost like he was worried about being- what? Being caught? It\u2019s not like he was cheating- that didn\u2019t even make sense.\n\u201cWhat can I say,\u201d he muttered, poking through the buttons one more time. \u201c\u2018M just an expert, I guess.\u201d\nThere was a brief awkward silence, before Quinn coughed and continued on.\n\u201cTry a scale,\u201d he suggested, pressing the button that had emitted the lowest pitch. \u201cIf we do them in order, maybe that\u2019ll release the string.\u201d\nQuickly, they took turns pressing buttons, listening as the tones climbed up in pitch until the last note rang out, high and true. The silver cord suddenly went slack above them, sagging below the rest. Quinn quickly yanked it out of the ground, wrapping the end of it around his palm a few times for good measure.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get ready to catch it,\u201d Tommy rushed out, already scrambling back into the water. He watched as others took notice, the teams not preoccupied with their own strings coming closer, sharks circling prey. \nWaiting.\nWith his best ever doggie paddle, Tommy was at the island in seconds, poised in front of the glass chute, ready to leap for it. He glanced over his shoulder, sending his teammate a sharp nod. Quinn nodded back and reeled back on the string, sending the piece shooting up the channel and out into the air. Tommy lunged for it, scooping it out of the water.\nSplashing grew louder as other competitors followed suit, and Tommy turned and ran, trying to get away as fast as one could when running in waist-deep water.\nSomeone snagged his shirt from behind and dragged him down, spluttering into the water. He thrashed, kicking out, and his foot struck something, the grip loosening enough for him to push away. Before he could rise though, someone else was holding his foot, pulling him toward them.\nTommy kicked wildly, vision white with bubbles and frothing water, trying to surface for air while his hands were clenched white-knuckled around the golden piece. There was a distorted yell, and another loud splash. His foot was let go and Tommy rose, gasping for air as his head broke out of the water once again. \nHe scrambled blindly for the edge, where Quinn was waiting, hand outstretched to pull him up and shouting encouragements. Tommy lunged for him. A hand clasped around his wrist, pulling him up out of the water.\nThey stumbled away from the edge, tangled in silver string, all sorts of ruckus following them.\n\u201cRun, Q-\u201c Tommy gasped, pulling his partner along, stumbling away. \u201cIt\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 piranha tank in there- We gotta go.\u201d\nQuinn listened, grabbing onto his arm and pulling them away, parting the strings for him. They scrambled onto the sand, booking it for the last and final section, Tommy still heaving for air. Once they got a decent distance between them and the maniacs of the Siren pool, Quinn forced him to stop moving.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Quinn worried, trying to unwind the lose string from both his and Tommy\u2019s arms, front of his shirt now sopping wet. \n\u201cGreat,\u201d Tommy coughed, taking a second to wring out the front of his shirt. \u201cExcept it has now just occurred to me that I no longer have my boots.\u201d\nThey both glanced down, confirming that yes, Tommy was in fact lacking anything besides a pair of wet and very sandy socks.\n\u201cI can go get them, if you want?\u201d Quinn cast a nervous glance back, eyes widening at whatever chaos was taking place now. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make it out alive, honestly.\u201d\nTommy have his arm a pat, shaking his head. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I think I\u2019ll manage.\u201d He held up the next piece, the yellow gem in the center of it winking in the sunlight. \u201cYou wanna cut this thing loose so we can put it on the necklace?\u201d\nQuinn whipped out a dagger impressively quickly, and began to saw away at the cord. The piece was freed, and Tommy once again lifted the pendant from his shirt, along with the Angel\u2019s green piece. They slotted the new addition onto the spindle, watching as it seamlessly slid into place, yellow next to green.\nTwo down, one to go.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Tommy began as the jogged over to the final section. \u201cI kinda like being all soggy. It\u2019s cool. Very refreshing.\u201d\nHis teammate cracked a grin. \u201cReally? How\u2019s the sand between your toes? That refreshing too?\u201d\n\u201cOkay- well, no-\u201c\nQuinn barked out a laugh at his spluttering, slowing down to a walk as they approached the final puzzle. Tommy slowed too, eyeing it with apprehension.\nThere weren\u2019t really more people here than there had been at the other two spots, but the stakes were definitely higher. It seemed that most of the teams- if not all of them- had figured out what the objective was. Tommy had even spotted another team over at the fountain, doing the same thing they had done at the beginning of the round.\nPeople knew now what they needed to do to win- and more specifically- who they needed to target. Pieces were limited.\nTommy and Quinn already had two of them. \nNow was not the time to be rushing into things.\nThey crept closer, trying to gauge what was going on with the strange checkerboard-like shapes and the pillars jutting out of them at random heights. Quinn didn\u2019t bother to put away his dagger. Tommy drew his sword once again, just in case.\n\u201cSo, the Blood God. Any ideas, oh walking encyclopedia of legendary knowledge?\u201d\n\u201cI resent that,\u201d Tommy muttered, watching as two teammates worked together to stand on a skinny stone pillar, their weight causing it to sink into the ground. His eyes swept over the area, realizing his original observation of the board hadn\u2019t been quite accurate. The area wasn\u2019t just one big square, but eight separate, identical squares.\n\u201cThe Blood God is the god of war, I know that much,\u201d Quinn continued, leading them toward one of the squares that seemed to have the least amount of people on it. \nFour already sat empty, a singular pillar risen from the middle. Solved.\nTommy followed.\n\u201cAnd revenge. War and revenge. That\u2019s the Blood God\u2019s specialty.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Tommy interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s war, revenge, strategy and liberation. The guy doesn\u2019t just represent all the bad shit, he\u2019s also important in other ways.\u201d\nAnd maybe that was a little passive-aggressive, but come on. Techno always got the bad reputation because everyone always forgot the last two.\nIt bothered him, okay?\n\u201cPassionate speech.\u201d\nTommy huffed, climbing up onto the closest pillar of their chosen checkerboard. \u201cThanks, I try.\u201d\nTo his surprise, it didn\u2019t sink underneath his feet the way he expected. He took a step to the side onto a different one, sinking a few inches as Quinn climbed up behind him. There was a startled cry along with the grinding of stone, and he glanced over his shoulder to see Quinn nearly a foot higher up than he had been before.\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cDo all of them do that?\u201d\nTommy jumped to a different spot, trying to find out. This time, when he sank, a pillar next to him rose up. \u201cLooks like it.\u201d\nQuinn carefully stepped down, and Tommy felt himself rise a little. He squinted down at the checkerboard, noticing that each stone had designs etched into them, some repeating more than others. It seemed familiar, really.\nThe longer he looked, the more reminiscent the whole thing became of a chess board, pieces already randomly scattered about.\nOn the square next to theirs, there was a sudden furious clash of metal, and Tommy turned just in time to catch multiple teams lunging toward the middle of the board, weapons colliding in a tangle of swords and spears and daggers.\nApparently, someone over there had solved it too.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re running low on time, Tommy.\u201d He turned away from the fight taking place next to them, following where Quinn\u2019s hand was pointing to. \u201cLook.\u201d\nOn the opposite side of the board, another team was systematically jumping from pillar to pillar, shifting the stones in a way that left little doubt that they knew what was going on.\nTommy grit his teeth, trying to think. They didn\u2019t have time to solve Techno\u2019s puzzle, as much as he would\u2019ve liked to. There were only three pieces remaining in this section, at least one of which was going to be taken if they didn\u2019t step in and do something.\n\u201cYou might hate me for what I\u2019m about to suggest, dear teammate,\u201d Tommy began, adjusting his grip on his sword, gaze still trained on the competitors across from them, \u201cBut I think we\u2019re gonna \u2018ave to fight for it.\u201d\nThere was a resigned sigh, but Quinn readied his dagger none the less. \u201cAny clue where the piece is going to show up?\u201d\nTommy jerked his chin in the direction of the square\u2019s center. \u201cJudging from the solved ones, right smack in the middle. We\u2019ll have to wait though, until they\u2019ve already solved it-\u201c\n\u201cOr we\u2019ll spook them,\u201d Quinn finished gravely. \u201cThat\u2019s a narrow time window, kid.\u201d\nTommy shuffled forward, sinking down again. He gave his partner a side-eyed look. \u201cDon\u2019t think we can pull it off, or what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried for us,\u201d Quinn laughed, and for the first time, Tommy saw something more to him, a glimpse of something dangerous lurking beneath the friendly exterior. \u201cI\u2019m worried for them.\u201d\nTommy brought his attention back over to the other team, right as both players jumped on a final pillar together, the stone sinking all the way to the ground with a loud crunch of stone and gears. In the center, a panel shifted, and another pillar rose from the middle square, something gold and glinting nestled on top of it.\n\u201cNow!\u201d Tommy shouted, leaping from his perch. \nThe other team was already on the move as well, probably having known what they were planning from the start. Tommy hopped from pillar to pillar, careful to keep his balance as the stones began to shift beneath his feet, Quinn nearby doing the same. Quick on his feet, Tommy pulled ahead of his teammate, now mere feet from the final piece.\nA lady on the other team beat him to it.\nShe leapt forward and swiped the golden shard from right under his nose, aiming to move past him and continue on. Quick as a wink, Tommy swatted her wrist with the flat of his sword, knocking the piece from her loose grip and onto the uneven surface. She let out a frustrated scream and dove for it, but Tommy checked her, knocking them both away from it.\n\u201cQuinn!\u201d He yelled, blocking as she pulled a knife on him, the weapon skidding down the blade of his sword. \u201cGrab the last piece!\u201d\n\u201cTrying!\u201d His teammate called back, letting out a grunt as the second competitor of the other team landed a blow. \u201cA bit busy!\u201d\nTommy ducked an elbow to the face, dancing to the side. The lady followed suit, and Tommy stumbled momentarily as the pillar he stood on shot up in the air. He leapt down behind it, hiding just in time to avoid a vicious slash of the other\u2019s knife.\nHe glanced behind him, and to his relief the piece remained untouched, Quinn and the other teammate locked in a battle only inches away.\nA kick came out of nowhere, and Tommy staggered back in surprise. He ducked again, before parrying the knife and getting in a slash of his own. There was a pained hiss, and Tommy grinned as he made his mark.\n\u201cSorry lady, gotta dash. Nice meeting you, though-\u201c\nHe turned and ran, trying to maneuver back over to Quinn as quickly as possible. This was made difficult, however, by the fact that Quinn\u2019s fight was moving about, causing the pillars Tommy was attempting to navigate to shift randomly, the stones lurching beneath his socked feet.\nHe tripped, falling to one knee, trying to steady himself. Momentarily distracted, Tommy failed to dodge his opponent\u2019s next swing, and he cried out as a shallow slash was made across his shoulders. Instinctively, Tommy bucked back, slamming his head into her stomach. He heard her gasp and took the chance to get up and running again, pressing one hand to the stinging wound on his back.\nIn front of him, a weapon clattered to the ground, and the sounds of fighting stopped for a brief second.\n\u201cTommy!\u201d Quinn called, \u201cCatch!\u201d\nAnd suddenly, the piece was sailing through the air, glinting in a beautiful arc. Jaw clenched, Tommy stretched out a hand, reaching with every inch of his height, just barely snagging it out of the air. He let out a pained hiss through his teeth at the way the motion tugged at his back.\nWithout hesitation, Tommy yanked the pendant from his shirt, jamming the final piece on, ruby joining emerald and topaz. \nThey\u2019d done it. \n\nThey\u2019d done it-\n\n\u201cTommy, look out!\u201d\nHe snapped out of it, flinging himself to the side as someone tried to tackle him from behind. Quinn abandoned his sparring partner, leaping over the shifting ground to come help. He pushed back the other competitor, giving Tommy time to get back on his feet.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Quinn shouted over the din of the fight between blows. \u201cWe have all the pieces, now what?\u201d\n\u201cThe fountain!\u201d Tommy called back, already starting to move. \u201cThat\u2019s where we got the centerpiece, we probably need to put it back!\u201d\nQuinn quickly abandoned the fight, getting in one last jab before joining Tommy in the mad dash for the center. Tommy could hear more than one set of footsteps following them as other teams realized just what Tommy possessed. \nThe hot sand singed his feet as he went, clothes sticking with water and sweat as he tripped his way toward the center of the arena, running faster than he had ever run in his life. His lungs burned, calves screaming, but Tommy didn\u2019t slow, only sparing a glance behind him for the briefest of moments to check if Quinn was still there.\nHis teammate shot him a thumbs up. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you- go!\u201d\nThe dry fountain loomed ahead of them, and Tommy could\u2019ve cried with relief, skidding to a halt so quickly he nearly toppled over. Quinn followed suit a second later.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Tommy panted, doubled over. \u201cWhen do they announce that we\u2019ve made it?\u201d\n\u201cLook for a place to put it or something,\u201d Quinn urged, rapidly scanning its surface. \u201cAnother slot, or something-\u201c\nTommy\u2019s eyes flicked over the basin, searching, searching-\nThere. A circular slot, the shape and size of the completed pendant, inlaid in the base of the fountain itself. A quick glance to the left and right confirmed it, the shape repeating itself in the stone.\n\u201cHand it over you damn thieves-\u201c One of the other players screeched, having finally caught up. \nQuinn stepped up, shielding Tommy\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019ll cover you, hurry!\u201d\nTommy fell to his knees and jammed the pendant into the slot, wiggling it around with desperate fingers, trying to find the right fit.\n\u201cCome on come on, fucking come on, damn it-\u201c\nThe pendant finally slid into place with a satisfying click, chain dangling from the front of it. Tommy let out a deep breath, slumping forward against the cool stone, pressing his forehead to it.\n\u201cThank the gods- that was fuckin\u2019 awful,\u201d he murmured, before turning around to inform his partner of their success. \u201cYo, Q! We\u2019ve done it! You can stop fighting now!\u201d\nHesitantly, Quinn dropped his hands, dagger loosening in his grip as he warily eyed the other team, who were now glaring at them both. He spared Tommy a cautious glance over his shoulder. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\nAs if to answer his question, the speaker system crackled to life, and the announcer\u2019s voice came on overhead. \u201cCongratulations to Team 17, our Competitors Quinn and Tommy for being the very first to complete the second round! All players must remain in the arena until the round is complete, but successful competitors are under sanctuary and off-limits during this time. Well done!\u201d\nTommy pushed himself off the ground, groaning at the discomfort in his back and the tiredness in- well, everything. The wound itself wasn\u2019t anything serious, but shit still hurt all the same. \nGods knows Dream and Wilbur are gonna have a field day after this, he thought, grimacing. One mother hen is bad enough, but two of them? Ugh.\nTommy fell back onto the flat edge of the fountain\u2019s lowest basin, making himself comfortable to wait out the rest of the round. Now that they\u2019d done it, it wouldn\u2019t be long until the other seven teams followed suit. He could even see another group sprinting toward them already, a mirror image of the mad chase he and Quinn had made moments before.\nHis teammate came over and collapsed next to him, letting out a breath of relief. Quinn chuckled quietly. \u201cThat was close at the end, huh.\u201d\nTommy smiled a little. \u201cIt sure was.\u201d\nQuinn grinned over at him. \u201cThanks for being my partner, kid.\u201d\n\u201cNot a kid.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t deny it before-\u201c\n\u201cWell, yeah. I was a bit busy, dude-\u201c\nQuinn just laughed, slinging a friendly arm over his shoulders, giving him a gentle squeeze. Tommy winced, letting out a quiet hiss of pain.\n\u201cOh shit-\u201c The arm pulled away in a panic, Quinn\u2019s face quickly filled with concern. \u201cAre you hurt? Sorry-\u201c\nNow it was Tommy\u2019s turn to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, \u2018tis just a flesh wound, Big Man. I\u2019ll live.\u201d He smiled over at Quinn, offering a fist instead. \u201cThanks for being my teammate, mate.\u201d\nQuinn grinned happily at him, accepting the fist bump.\nThey sat on the fountain in a comfortable silence after that, watching the chaos reign around them.\n\u201c...Do you think I could go get my boots now?\u201d\nThe only response he got to that was a hearty laugh. \nTommy cracked another smile.\n\nWe did it.\n\n\u201cStop fucking laughing- hey, it\u2019s not funny!\u201d\n\u201cIt is, though. It\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I just got dried off, too,\u201d Tommy whined.\nQuinn laughed at him again, sticking his hands in his pockets as they left the competitors\u2019 room, the afternoon waning. \u201cYou were sitting on the edge of a fountain, Tommy. I don\u2019t really know what you expected.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 expect for it to turn on, that\u2019s what!\u201d He complained miserably. \u201cHow was I supposed to know that the last team putting their thing into it would turn it on, huh? Those fuckin\u2019-\u201c He kicked at the ground, grumbling, continuing to curse under his breath as he stubbed his still boot-less toes.\n(Quinn, like the lovely lad he was, had gone to get them after the challenge was over, but Tommy said that putting them back on with the state of his socks would classify as a war crime. Instead, he chose to carry them by the laces, occasionally smacking random passerby with them, just to be a menace to society.)\nThey were one of the last teams to leave, everyone worn out by now, eager to go home and crash hard before the final fights tomorrow. Tommy let out a massive yawn, trying and failing to stifle it.\nAs they walked around to the main entrance, the crowd grew thicker, although it wasn\u2019t nearly as busy as it had been following the first round. Craning his neck, Tommy spotted Dream easily, his green hoodie blindingly obvious. Much more surprising, though, was the fact that Wilbur and Techno hovered right behind his friend, sporting a set of twin smirks that just screamed mischief. Confused, Tommy raised a hand in greeting, and Wilbur gave him a cheeky wave back before pointing in the general direction of the Temple and promptly vanishing. Dumbfounded, Tommy watched as Techno flashed him a quick thumbs up and did the same.\n\u201cWho\u2019re you waving at?\u201d Quinn asked from beside him, curious. \u201cYou have fans or something?\u201d\nTommy laughed, waving again, this time to catch Dream\u2019s attention. \u201c\u2026Something like that.\u201d\nThe man finally spotted him and jogged over, grinning. \u201cTommy!\u201d he called over the heads of the remaining stragglers. \u201cNice work out there, man! You gotta slow down though- or soon your reputation is gonna be better than mine.\u201d\nTommy snickered, swinging his boots around to smack Dream in the leg as his friend came to a stop in front of him. \u201cThat would be a tragedy, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDream side stepped a second swing and leveled him with a glare, but it was one that lacked any real heat. \u201cIs that a threat, Innit?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tommy drawled, slinging an arm around Quinn\u2019s shoulders, smirking, \u201cI\u2019ve already replaced you, see?\u201d\nQuinn remained uncharacteristically silent, offering none of the quips and wit Tommy had grown used to in the past couple hours. Tommy spared him a glance, confused. \u201cYou good Big Man?\u201d\nBeside him, his teammate was frozen in place, gaping. Tommy followed his line of sight to Dream, and then back again. He nudged the guy, but Quinn hardly reacted, still staring.\n\u201c\u2026Quinn?\u201d\n\u201cYou know Dream.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s arm grew slack, head tilted in confusion. \u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\nQuinn spluttered. \u201cYou- that\u2019s- you know Dream.\u201d He jabbed a finger in Dream\u2019s direction, face full of awe and disbelief. \u201cTommy, that\u2019s Dream. Dream.\u201d\nDream chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll take it you\u2019ve heard of me, then?\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s whole face lit up, a childish smile on his face. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, laughing. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve heard of you! You\u2019re a freaking legend around here, dude! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d \nTommy snorted, rolling his eyes. \u201cFanboy, much?\u201d\nQuinn pushed his arm off, still grinning. \u201cShut up and let me talk to my idol.\u201d\nTommy waved dismissively. \u201cHe\u2019s not like, invincible or anything. See, watch this-\u201c\nTommy wildly swung his boots around, whacking Dream in the stomach, who promptly doubled over with a surprised \u201cOof!\u201d, followed by a groan. \n\u201cTa-da! The legend has been toppled, an\u2019 I now reign supreme. Bow at my feet, bitch.\u201d\n\u201cThis is bullying,\u201d Dream wheezed, still bent over.\nQuinn watched the whole interaction with a certain sort of fascination, the one that often accompanied someone realizing for the first time just how little respect Tommy had for figures of authority, or really just the status quo in general. Tommy leaned over and set an elbow on Dream\u2019s head, to which the man let out a long suffering sigh, doing little to stop it, as if he had accepted his fate. \nDream looked over at Quinn, eyes pleading. \u201cHelp me, please.\u201d\n\u201cI- uh,\u201d Quinn stumbled, looking a little lost, unsure how to react to a local legend being harassed by a particularly loud teen, and doing little about it.\nWhat can I say, Tommy thought gleefully, I just have that effect on people.\nTommy leaned more of his weight onto Dream\u2019s back, glad to give his aching muscles a momentary rest. \u201cIgnore him, Q. He\u2019s just being a dick.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst, Tommy. You know that?\u201d\nQuinn gave them both an awkward smile, miles out of his depth. Tommy didn\u2019t really blame him. Dealing with Dream was a lot of work- that\u2019s why he took the fall for the rest of humanity.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna head out, it\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Quinn said casually, taking a few stilted steps forward. \u201cBut it was really nice meeting you\u2026\u201d He cast Dream one last bewildered look, before sending Tommy a soft sort of smile. \u201cUh- Have a good evening, guys. And I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Tommy.\u201d\nTommy draped himself completely over Dream\u2019s back. He gave a floppy wave at Quinn as the man began to retreat back into the city. \u201cSee you, Big Man,\u201d he mumbled, chin drooping onto Dream\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou good, Tommy?\u201d\nHe groaned. \u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 tired, Big D. It\u2019s bedtime.\u201d\nDream snorted, slowly straightening up, careful not to dump the boneless teen onto the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s only like 6 pm, what are you even talking about-\u201c\nTommy grumbled, flinging his arms over Dream\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019 care.\u201d\nHands scooped under his knees, and he was seamlessly hefted into the air in a piggyback. Dream began to walk, the gentle swaying motion making the tiredness even harder to combat, boots in his hand thumping steadily against Dream\u2019s chest. Tommy hooked his chin over the other\u2019s shoulder, the hood of the iconic sweatshirt making a very convenient pillow. \n\u201cYou\u2019re all wet, by the way,\u201d Dream observed, mild disgust in his voice. \u201cI can feel your soggy hair on my neck, dude. Gross.\u201d\nTommy shrugged. \u201cFountain,\u201d he said simply, in lieu of an actual explanation.\n\u201cYeah, gross.\u201d\nBut Dream didn\u2019t drop him, steadily moving them down the street and away from the arena. It was a weird sort of calm after the day\u2019s constant excitement, the low-lying hustle and bustle of the city a comfort, the gentle hum of voices and the sound feet on cobble. Distantly, Tommy could make out music drifting from somewhere near the main square. Dream readjusted his grip, jostling him a bit.\nJaw clenched, Tommy squirmed a little, trying to hide the discomfort as his back twinged. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t done a good enough job. \nThey stopped moving.\n\u201cWait- are you hurt?\u201d Dream questioned, concern flooding his voice. \u201cI know it got pretty rough out there, but I couldn\u2019t really see much-\u201c\nThere was a momentary pause while they both waited for Tommy\u2019s answer.\n\u201c\u2026No,\u201d Tommy finally muttered.\nA disbelieving hum. Dream gave him a stern look out of the corner of his eye. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d\nTommy reached up and lightly smacked him on the back of the head. \u201cFuckin\u2019- yes, you pussy. Now keep moving, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d\nStill skeptical, Dream continued on, casting him a worried glance every once in a while, despite the fact that Tommy\u2019s eyes had drifted closed. He tried not to feel guilty about the lie, holding on on a little tighter.\nWilbur was gonna be all over him the instant he got to the Temple anyway, he reasoned to himself. There was no need to worry Dream about it too.\nThey were nearing the older district, and the corner that had been their meetup place for years. See, technically Dream had no idea where he lived, running on blind faith that Tommy was telling the truth when he said he had a place to stay. If Dream ever found out that his place was actually the city temple- well. It would be an interesting development, to say the least.\nThe soothing motion stopped all too soon, and Tommy cracked his eyes open, taking in the familiar buildings around them. Damn. He had just gotten comfy, too.\nTommy wriggled around, preparing to be let go, but Dream held on, hesitating. Tommy poked him in the shoulder. \u201cWhatcha waiting for, Dream?\u201d\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to take you all the way home?\u201d he asked quietly, tone hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a big deal, Tommy. I want to, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd break tradition?!\u201d Tommy gasped, scandalized, as he impatiently pushed to be let go. \u201cBlasphemy!\u201d\nReluctantly, Dream let him down onto the street, turning to give him a once over, arms crossed. His face scrunched up. \u201cIt\u2019s just- you look a bit like shit, Tommy. Gonna be honest with you.\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes, casually swinging his boots over his shoulder. He regretted it instantly, choking down a quiet scream. Mistake. That was a mistake. He shot Dream a pained smile, which was more of a grimace, really. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Big D. Quit worrying so much. What are you, my mum?\u201d\nDream smiled faintly, some of the worry fading from his face. \u201cIf I was your mom, I would\u2019ve given you up for adoption long ago, Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah yeah, fuck off-\u201c\nHe was cut off by Dream wrapping a hand around the back of his head and pulling him into a hug, tugging Tommy down toward his shoulder. After a moment, Tommy melted into it, bringing his free hand up to grasp the back of the ugly ass hoodie.\n\u201cProud of you, kid,\u201d Dream murmured, cheek pressed to his damp and gritty hair.\nThere was a funny warm feeling in Tommy\u2019s chest, pressing up into his rib cage and swelling around his lungs. He pressed a smile into the hoodie. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d he whispered.\nThey held on for one more moment, before Dream released him with a sigh. \u201cI guess I should head out, then,\u201d he said, pulling back. He reached up and ruffled Tommy\u2019s hair, ignoring the halfhearted attempts to bat the hand away. \u201cNight, Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cG\u2019night, Dream.\u201d\nAnd with that, Dream headed down the street, sending Tommy one last smile over his shoulder before disappearing around the corner. \nThe warm feeling in Tommy\u2019s chest stayed.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nHis footfalls were muffled on the stone steps of the Temple\u2019s entrance, socks sliding on the polished stone as he trudged his way in. A few disgusted looks were thrown his way by worshippers going the opposite direction, his sandy and sodden appearance apparently not up to par with the standards of the establishment. He paid them little mind, though, too focused on the idea of collapsing into his nest of blankets and passing the fuck out to care. \nTiredly, Tommy wandered past the statues, now adorned with garlands, candles and offerings laid at their feet, lazily giving them the finger as he passed. There was a lack of scandalized gasps, much to his disappointment. \nMuscle memory took him down the familiar halls to his alcove, yawning, socks shuffling against the marble floor. The warm torchlight flickered, chasing away the shadows that were beginning to creep in as evening bled into night. Tommy hummed absentmindedly, slowly swinging his boots back and forth in time with his steps, the gentle bumping of them keeping the pace.\nAs soon as his alcove came in sight, so did the gods. A brief flare and snap of the light, and Wilbur was standing in his way, a delighted look on his face, Techno materializing right behind him. Faintly amused, Tommy noted that both of them had returned to their usual robes, although Techno still had on Phil\u2019s hat, for whatever odd reason.\n\u201cTommy!\u201d Wil practically shrieked, wasting no time in gathering him up in his arms, seemingly to smother him with affection. \u201cI\u2019m so proud, you made the rest of them look like absolute idiots, well done-\u201c\nThe arms around him squeezed a little too tight on his wounded shoulder, and Tommy let out a strangled yelp at the sting. Wilbur\u2019s praises died immediately, grip going slack.\nHere we go... \nTommy resigned himself to his fate.\n Wilbur\u2019s face turned stony and serious, Techno behind looking on in mild concern.\n\u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d Wil demanded, hands moving up to Tommy\u2019s face, tilting it side to side, searching. \u201cIs it the bruise? Wicked mark, by the way- or something else?\u201d\n\u201cShoulder,\u201d Tommy squeezed out, cheeks still caught in Wilbur\u2019s grasp. \u201cKnife. Stab. Ow.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Wilbur,\u201d Techno cut in, reaching over to pry the other god\u2019s hands from Tommy\u2019s face, to which he was immensely grateful. \u201cYou\u2019re smotherin\u2019 him.\u201d\nTommy reached up to poke at the bruise on his cheek, grimacing at the tenderness of it. \nWil batted at Techno\u2019s hands, but relented his affectionate attack. \u201cFine, but can I at least clean him off? He\u2019s all wet and everything.\u201d Wilbur cast Techno a nasty look. \u201cOr is that shit smothering, too?\u201d\nTechno ignored the jab, looking at Tommy for answer, who just shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. Sand is fuckin\u2019 itchy, man.\u201d\nWilbur simply snapped his fingers, and the air contracted around him, hugging his body with an alien pressure. When the sensation relaxed, Tommy glanced down, pleased to find he was no longer caked in sand and his hair no longer damp and crunchy. He sighed in satisfaction. \u201cThanks Wil.\u201d\n\u201cShoulder,\u201d Was the reply. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal. You have to let us treat it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, fine- whatever-\u201c Tommy muttered, moving past the two gods to his pile of belongings. \u201cJust gimme a second to change, my clothes are all sweaty.\u201d\n\u201cWe know, I can smell you from here,\u201d Techno deadpanned.\nTommy flipped him off, snatching a clean pair of pants and setting aside a shirt for later. He glanced over his shoulder to see Wilbur hovering like a damn hawk.\n\u201cTurn around, will you? Don\u2019t watch me change, that\u2019s creepy as hell.\u201d\nWilbur rolled his eyes, but followed orders none the less. \u201cSorry I that I care, my sincerest, kindest apologies-\u201c\nTommy quickly exchanged his pants for the clean ones, glancing over at Wilbur, who still had his back turned. A wonderful impulse struck, and he peeled off his ruined socks, hurling them at the back of the god\u2019s head.\nThey made their mark with a satisfying, wet thwack. A disgusted shriek followed. Both Techno and Tommy burst into laugher as Wilbur scrambled to peel them off, spluttering indignantly. Tommy had to lean against the wall for support, trying to catch his breath.\nWilbur whipped around, throwing the nasty socks to the side, glowering. \u201cI will fucking smite you, child.\u201d\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t,\u201d Tommy sang, grinning. \u201cYou love me too much.\u201d\n\u201cThat we do, kid,\u201d Techno interrupted, stepping forward to pull him away from the wall, mirth still swimming in his eyes. \u201cBut let\u2019s save the smitin\u2019 for after we take a look at your shoulder, okay?\u201d\nObediently, Tommy gingerly peeled off his damp shirt, hissing as it stuck to the wound on its way over his head. Techno\u2019s gentle hands helped, guiding his arms through. The god let out a sigh at the sight of the injury.\n\u201cDid you even try to keep it clean?\u201d\n\u201cYes, as a matter of fact. You are simply a bitch, Technoblade.\u201d\nTechno gave him a light smack upside the head, which did little to dampen Tommy\u2019s cheeky smile. \u201cWilbur, keep the little gremlin here. I\u2019m gonna go get Phil, he\u2019s better with this type\u2019a stuff.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019kay,\u201d Wilbur hummed, plopping himself down on Tommy\u2019s blanket nest. He latched onto the teen\u2019s arm, tugging at his wrist. \u201cSit, child.\u201d\nTommy let himself be pulled, sinking down beside Wil, a low groan escaping as he stretched out his legs, limbs aching. Wilbur fussed over him, putting a blanket over his lap and tucking it in, careful to avoid touching his back. Fingers combed through his hair, tugging out the knots, and further contributing to the heaviness in Tommy\u2019s limbs. A sleepy hum escaped as his eyes closed, leaning into the feeling.\nBeside him, Wil snickered, but the sound was fond, warm. Tommy hummed again, slumping back onto the god behind him.\n\u201cYou gotta wait for Phil, Toms,\u201d Wilbur chided, a smile in his voice. \u201cMedical attention, then sleep.\u201d\n\u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\n\u201cHmm... no.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018No\u2019, you little gremlin boy? You\u2019re not sleeping yet-\u201c\nThe temperature of the room dropped a few degrees, light dimming as Phil melded out of the shadows, Techno following right behind. Tommy cracked an eye open, peering up at him, watching as Phil settled the shadowy shapes that made up the wings on his back. Phil smiled down at him, but wasted no time, moving to settle on his right side, Techno taking the remaining space in front.\n\u201cHey mate,\u201d Phil murmured, pulling a damp cloth and a roll of bandages from nowhere. \u201cSeems like you\u2019ve been busy, huh.\u201d\nTommy snorted, closing his eyes again and leaning onto Wilbur as the cloth carefully wiped at the cut. \u201cYou could say that. One hell of a competition you guys have got going on.\u201d\nThe gods all chuckled quietly at that one, Wil reaching up to pat his head. \u201cFunny joke, Tommy.\u201d\nHe cracked a slow smile, shrugging. \u201cWha\u2019 can I say, \u2018m a fuckin\u2019 comedian.\u201d\nPhil\u2019s hands on his shoulders were warm and gentle, ghosting over the wound as they bandaged it with ease. The initial pain had dulled long ago, and Phil\u2019s careful movements did little to aggravate it. Tommy felt himself begin to drift off.\n\u201cDamn, he\u2019s already sleepin\u2019,\u201d Techno teased, poking at his foot. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you actually follow your bedtime.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, bitch,\u201d Tommy shot back halfheartedly, blindly kicking out with his feet, trying to get him. Techno caught the offending limbs and promptly tucked them under the blankets, giving them a kindly pat once finished. There was a faint tug on his shoulders as Phil wrapped the last bit before giving Tommy\u2019s arm a squeeze.\n\u201cAll done, mate. You can sleep now, if you want. We don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018M not even tired,\u201d Tommy protested weakly, shifting to get more comfortable against Wilbur\u2019s unnecessarily bony arm. \u201c\u2018M wide- wide awake-\u201c he yawned.\nWilbur scooted back a bit, ignoring Tommy\u2019s whine of protest and attempt to follow along with the movement. \u201cGive me a second, child,\u201d he huffed, adjusting the pillows and blankets underneath them. Once satisfied, the god guided him down, Tommy\u2019s head resting in his lap, and someone else pulled a blanket over his shoulders.\nA calm hush fell over the little alcove, the sun outside the tiny window just beginning to set, the sky a faded shade of pink and orange. A hand combed through his hair, and above him, Wilbur began to sing, the quiet whispers of the melody lost in the indistinguishable buzz of warmth in Tommy\u2019s head.\n\u201cSweet dreams, kiddo,\u201d Phil whispered, letting his wings stretch out, a whispy, inky blanket.\n\u201cWhen you wake up,\u201d Techno continued quietly, \u201cWilbur and I are gonna tell you all about this loser we met at the tournament, you\u2019ll love it-\u201c\n\u201cHush,\u201d Wil interrupted, smacking Techno\u2019s leg. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to sleep. Bother him in the morning about it.\u201d\n\u201cBruh, that\u2019s literally what I just said-\u201c\n\u201cWell, it sounds to me like you\u2019re still talking-\u201c\nTommy smiled, burying deeper into the blankets, letting the familiar bickering fade into the background.\nThe temple itself may not be his house, his own place in the way he told Dream it was, but there was no doubt in Tommy\u2019s mind.\nHere, he was home.\n\nComfy.\n\nThat was the first thought that came to mind as Tommy woke.\nThe air was warm, his mound of blankets soft and heavy around him, threatening to drag him back under. He sighed, happily snuggling back into them. A little extra doze never hurt anyone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be late if you do that,\u201d a deep voice mused.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d he mumbled sleepily, irritated by whoever had the audacity to interrupt his snoozing. \u201cBitch.\u201d\nThere was a rumble of laughter, and a hand reached out and yanked the blanket off of him. \u201cCome on- up. Wilbur will kick my ass if he finds out I let you oversleep while he\u2019s out gettin\u2019 breakfast.\u201d\nTommy cracked a resentful eye open, glaring blearily up at the god before him. Techno looked unfairly amused at all of this, and it only deepened the scowl on his face. \u201cI never oversleep. \u2018M a big man, and big men don\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cSure, Tommy. You tell that to the tournament officials when you fail to show up for your first fight in less than an hour.\u201d\nAt this, Tommy was wide awake.\n\u201cAn hour?\u201d He shot up, eyes wide. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up sooner?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Techno deadpanned, crossing his arms. \u201cYou swore at me and then fell back asleep. Twice.\u201d\n\u201cOh you fuckin\u2019-\u201c Tommy swore, scrambling to his feet, snatching random clothes that were most likely clean and throwing them on, still muttering angrily to himself. Techno gave him space, letting the whirlwind of grumpy teenager do as he pleased.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Wil, anyway?\u201d Tommy asked, lacing up his boots with record speed. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought he and Phil would be here to harass me, too.\u201d\n\u201cWilbur went to go get you food or somethin\u2019,\u201d Techno replied, distractedly watching the courtyard outside the small window. \u201cPhil\u2019s off doing his duties, cause he\u2019s actually responsible like that.\u201d\n\u201cCool, cool-\u201c \nTommy tugged the last knot, rushing to his feet and starting off down the hallway, calling back over his shoulder, \u201cTell Wil I\u2019ll get something on the way there, I gotta head out-\u201c\n\u201cUh\u2026Tommy-\u201c\n\u201cWish me luck, Blade, I\u2019ll fight with honor and all that shit-\u201c\n\u201cTommy-\u201c\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never even know what hit \u2018em, I\u2019m just too poggers to handle-\u201c\n\u201cTommy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cSword.\u201d\nHe stopped dead in his tracks. \n\u2026Oh.\nWhoops.\nHe turned back around to find Techno holding it out, a disgustingly fond smile on his face. Sheepishly, Tommy took the weapon, muttering a quiet thanks before slipping it into his belt and taking off down the hall.\nTechno watched him go, still smiling to himself.\n\u201cGood luck, kid,\u201d he murmured.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTommy\u2019s feet slammed into the ground as he skidded around street corners, watching the looming arena grow closer in the distance. One hand held onto his sword, the other an apple that he had\u2026borrowed on his way through the market square. He took another bite, silently praying that he wouldn\u2019t trip and choke. That would just be double the embarrassment.\nSoon enough, the competitor\u2019s entrance loomed before him, and he dashed right in, ignoring the protests of the check-in lady stationed by the door. Considering no one came after him, though, he assumed it was fine.\nThe room felt oddly empty upon entering, the low murmur of contestants speaking having been replaced by the clang of armor and the harsh scrape of blades being sharpened, people spread far and few between. Tommy glanced around, looking for an empty place and getting competitive or even downright hostile looks in return. His gaze landed on a piece of parchment, very official and fancy looking, posted on the wall.\nCurious, Tommy approached it. Upon closer inspection, he realized what the paper was. \nThe fight listings. \nWho would be fighting who, what order, and even each competitors\u2019 weapon of choice. A quick scan of the bracket revealed him to be on the opposite side of Quinn, meaning they wouldn\u2019t be fighting unless both of them made it to the finale. Tommy breathed out a sigh of relief at that.\nHis former teammate (dare he say, his friend, even) was a formidable fighter, based on yesterday\u2019s challenge, and Tommy had no desire to go up against him anytime soon. Not that he had a lack of confidence in his own abilities, but still. If it ended up being him and Quinn together in the grand finale, he wouldn\u2019t really be surprised.\nMaking a quick note of who he would be up against first fight (some person who favored a staff, of all things), Tommy left the listings behind, knowing he was running out of time to prepare. He would be fighting fifth, more on the tail end of things, but fights went fast, and Tommy had gotten there late enough as it was.\nThe general rules of the final round were known well enough: one-on-one fights, each person uses the weapon of their choice and any extra gear they would like from the competitor\u2019s weapons room. Fights were a free for all, but heavy injuries were highly discouraged, and killing was meant to be out of the picture entirely.\nThere were a few, uh- incidents staining the tournament\u2019s history, but in general, everyone made it out okay. Tommy, for one, had little worries about that. \nHe ambled his way over to a couple racks of armor, considerate. His feet stopped in front of an untouched golden set, glowing softly in the late morning light. Plucking an arm brace from the stand, Tommy turned the piece over in his hands.\nSee, Tommy hadn\u2019t been trained by his best buddy Dream for nothing. He knew how to play to his advantages in these types of fights. And Tommy knew- he was fast, he was quick on his feet, and dodging was his specialty. If he wanted to play to those strengths, bagging himself down with heavy, bulky armor, as tempting as it was, would be a terrible mistake.\nTommy set the arm brace aside, reaching forward to collect its twin, as well as the greaves and helmet from the set. Light enough pieces to still give him plenty of mobility, yet still able to protect. \nDistantly, a bell rang, signaling the official beginning of the final round. Tommy tuned out the announcement calling forth the first two fighters, hardly noticing as his fellow contestants strode past, to busy focusing on the task at hand.\nHe strapped on the greaves with ease, the gold settling comfortably against his skin as he did so.\nThe bell rang again, and two more contestants disappeared onto the arena floor.\nNext came the braces, which were slightly more difficult to do one handed, but Tommy managed.\nAnother clang of the bell.\nFinished with the armor, Tommy looked up just in time to catch the next pair disappearing through the gate. Much to his annoyance, he recognized one of them: the dickhead from the day before, the one whose head was so far up his own ass that he probably had seen a god.\nPrivately, Tommy wished him the worst of luck.\nThe bench below him creaked, and Tommy glanced over, curious to see who had joined him. To his lack of surprise, Quinn looked back, excitement shining bright in his eyes.\n\u201cMorning, Tommy,\u201d he chirped, smiling. \u201cFine day for a fight, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI want to go back to bed,\u201d Tommy deadpanned, the quirk of his lips betraying the joke.\nQuinn laughed, throwing back his head, the light glinting off of the steel helmet on top of it. \u201cOnly you, dude. Only you.\u201d\nTommy leaned forward, setting his elbows on his knees, watching the arena gates. \u201cYou\u2019re up soon, yeah?\u201d\nQuinn nodded, chuckles dying down. \u201cUp against some guy who uses a crossbow, of all things. Not sure how that works.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, not a ranged weapon man yourself?\u201d\nHis fellow contestant shook his head, flipping the dagger from yesterday out of its scabbard with practiced ease.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tommy said, nodding knowledgeably. \u201cA knife man, then. I can respect that. \u2018M always down to do a bit of stabbing meself.\u201d He patted the hilt of his sword lovingly.\nQuinn snorted, shaking his head, amused. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nThe bell rang again, and Quinn hopped up, eager. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue. Wish me luck.\u201d\n\u201cGo kill it out there, buddy.\u201d\nQuinn shot him a final smile before striding out into the arena, looking for all intents and purposes like knight off to war. Tommy watched him go, silently cheering him on.\nQuinn won.\nSoon enough, Tommy\u2019s name was the one being called, echoing off the sand stone walls. He stood, golden helmet tucked under arm. With a deep breath, Tommy strode through the gate, head held high, determination in every limb. His opponent followed, staff in hand, and they both strode their way to the center of the arena floor, where a bright red ring had been painted into the sand.\nThe speakers crackled to life, and Tommy planted his feet, watching the competitor across from him.\n\u201cThe same rules apply for each fight in the final round. Contestants will engage one another until either a yield has been called, or one has been pushed out of the ring. Each may use a weapon of their choice, and the winner advances.\u201d\nEyes narrowed, scrutinizing, Tommy slid the helmet over his head with steady hands. He drew his sword, focus dialing in, limbs poised and ready to spring. Even as the announcer spoke, the two began to pace in tandem, slowly circling, waiting for the chance to strike.\n\u201cThe fight will commence with the bell. May the gods be with you!\u201d\nThe bell tolled.\nThey both lunged, feet pounding the sand, sword meeting staff in the center of the ring. Tommy\u2019s blade slid down the polished wood, skidding. They pushed away from one another, and Tommy swung again, a low slice through the air. The end of his opponent\u2019s staff met the blow with a resounding clatter, and they pushed away from one another again.\nStill circling, eyes locked onto one another, waiting for the faintest twitch, the merest of hints as to who would move next.\nIt wasn\u2019t Tommy.\nHis opponent came running at him, staff coming around in a wide arc, which Tommy parried easily. He countered with a jab of his own, but it was deflected once again. Tommy spun, dancing around them, trying to catch their back unguarded. \nNo such luck. \nHis next swing was caught, and they stayed locked together, each pushing for the upper hand, heels skidding through the sand.\nTommy lashed out with a foot, aiming for their shins. Momentarily caught off guard, his opponent stumbled, gifting him an opportunity. He lunged, swinging at their chest, and they stumbled back to avoid it. Tommy followed, quickly raining blows on both sides, which were barely met by both ends of the sturdy wooden staff, the opponent scrambling to keep up.\nSweat already pooling on his brow, Tommy grinned- a sharp, wild thing. \nHe suddenly stepped back, a momentary pause in his assault, and watched the other person stutter, confused. His eyes caught on their hands, slack on the wood with their surprise. Quick as a wink, Tommy struck out with his foot, hooking it around the lower end of the staff as it scraped against the sand. Simultaneously, his sword shot out, crashing into the upper end and catapulting the weapon from the other\u2019s grip.\n\u201cYield, bitch!\u201d he shouted joyously, sword held level at their throat.\nThere was a scoff, and they darted to the side, trying to go for the staff lying in the sand a couple feet away. Tommy copied the movement, backing them up against the red line, their heels skidding the edge. He kept pressing forward, threatening to topple them, but they refused to give up, eyes darting around, looking for a way out.\nTommy kept his sword up, inching closer. With a laugh, he kicked their feet out from under them, watching with satisfaction as they hit the dirt, breaking the boundary line.\nThe bell rang again.\n\u201cTommy Innit has progressed to the next fight!\u201d crackled over the system, nearly drowned out by the cheers suddenly flooding the air.\nTommy laughed again, eyes bright, and tucked his sword away, offering out a hand. Begrudgingly, his opponent took it, and he offered them a smile.\nThey returned it, although less enthusiastic about it, before retreating from the arena floor, disappearing through the gate. Tommy followed.\nAfter the first fight, time blurred, the day melding into an incomprehensible mix of heat and sand, pounding heart beats and dodging blows, flashes of metal and screams of delight from the stands. The bell was a constant, ringing in time as the number of contestants remaining dwindled, slowly but surely.\nTommy moved on. Quinn moved on. Much their distaste, so did their least favorite asshole.\nBefore Tommy even knew what was happening, he was standing above his third opponent, the tip of his sword pressing into their chest, his own heaving for air. The raucous cheers from the stands swam around him, and another bell sounded, signaling the end of the fight.\n\u201cAnd the first of our contestants to make it to the final fight, the grand finale- Tommy Innit!\u201d\nTommy blinked, stepping back and letting his sword drop.\nOh.\nHe had- that was the semifinal. \nAnd he\u2019d won.\nOnce the haze of battle cleared, a wide grin cut across his face, childish and proud, and he laughed wildly. \n\nHe was in the final!\n\nTommy slid his sword into his belt, stepping forward to offer up a hand, same as before. \n\nPhil would be so proud of his sportsmanship skills.\n\nHis opponent looked at it, skeptical, before taking it, and Tommy pulled them to their feet. They sent him a curt nod, and headed back to the competitors room, having accepted their defeat.\nTommy waited longer to make his retreat, sending the audience a cheeky salute, smile so wide it made his cheeks ache.\nTheir roars of approval followed him back through the gate.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe room felt eerily quiet, empty as it was this late in the game.\nTommy wiped down his sword for the umpteenth time, listening as the echoes of the crowd came through the gates, something unidentifiable and nervous sitting in the pit of his stomach. He couldn\u2019t tell for the life of him if Quinn was winning or not.\nIt had boiled down to the three of them: Tommy, the first of the finalists, with Quinn and Dickhead Supreme in the second semi-final.\nTommy had barely had time to wish Quinn good luck before his friend was hustling past, already on his way to the next fight. He was hopeful, though.\nThe cloth swiped down the blade once again, a soft hiss against metal. Sounds of thrilled screaming and yelling surged. Distantly, a bell tolled, signaling the end of the fight.\nTommy\u2019s hands stilled, eyes locked on the gate as the metal retreated, waiting.\nThe self proclaimed \u2018Chosen One\u2019 came through first, sporting few injuries and a smug look of self-congratulation. He sent a nasty grin Tommy\u2019s way, strolling past him to the furthest corners of the room. Tommy\u2019s heart sank. \nIt appeared that Quinn had lost.\nTommy set the cloth and his sword aside, pushing to his feet. Something in his gut nudged him forward, and he darted to the other side of the room, gathering first aid materials. He turned back just in time to catch Quinn dragging himself out of the arena, arm clutching his stomach and limping, a grimace on his face.\n\u201cBig Man!\u201d\nQuinn lifted his head, giving Tommy a weak smile. \nTommy rushed over, ushering his friend to sit on a bench, already preparing to wrap whatever injury he had. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nQuinn nodded, stretching out his injured leg with a wince. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Tommy, just a bit roughed up is all.\u201d\nAt Tommy\u2019s prompting, Quinn gingerly pulled his hand away from his stomach and lifted the hem of his shirt, revealing a long but shallow slash across his front. Tommy winced in sympathy, crouching down to carefully dab at the wound. \n\u201cBastard got you good,\u201d he murmured.\nQuinn sighed above him. \u201cGuy fights nasty, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably as Tommy hit a tender spot, waving off the muttered apology. Quinn sent a quick glance over his shoulder, lowering his voice to a whisper. \u201cBetween you and me, I think he has a bit of a problem with holding grudges.\u201d\nTommy huffed out a quiet laugh, carefully wrapping a roll of bandages around Quinn\u2019s torso, fastening it with a final tug. \u201cI\u2019ll get him back for you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nQuinn cracked a smile at that, but it didn\u2019t quite seem to meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could Tommy, but\u2026well-\u201c\nTommy set aside the bandages, straightening up and moving away to retrieve his sword. He slid it into his belt, turning back and waiting for Quinn to continue. When he didn\u2019t, Tommy sighed, crossing his arms. \u201cJust spit it out, dude.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust him,\u201d Quinn muttered, shooting a glare in the direction the man had disappeared off into. \nTommy laughed a little, bending over to tighten the laces on his boots. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t, he\u2019s a self-obsessed little bitch. I\u2019d be more concerned if you did.\u201d\nQuinn turned to face him, brow furrowed. He opened his mouth to continue, but upon giving Tommy a once over, he appeared to change tracks. \u201cIs that all you\u2019re taking out into the fight?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Tommy said, glancing down at himself in confusion. \u201cI used this for the other fights, too.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Nothing besides the arm braces and the greaves?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\nQuinn stood slowly, limping his way over to a wall of equipment.\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with my gear?\u201d\nHis friend didn\u2019t answer, reaching up to pull a simple wooden and iron shield from the wall, testing out its weight. Seemingly satisfied, he turned back, holding it up. \u201cYou know how to fight with one of these?\u201d\nTommy raised his brows, still lost. \u201cI mean, yeah, but I don\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cGood,\u201d Quinn said, hobbling over and shoving it into his arms. \u201cDo it then.\u201d\n\u201cDude, seriously- what the fuck,\u201d Tommy protested, even as he took it and slipped his arm into the leather straps. \u201cYou\u2019re being weird.\u201d\nQuinn shrugged, slowly lowering himself back onto the bench. \u201cI just want you to win if I can\u2019t, is all,\u201d he said simply, face for once unreadable. He gestured at the shield at Tommy\u2019s side. \u201cThat\u2019ll help, trust me.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Tommy deadpanned, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhatever you say, buddy.\u201d\nQuinn\u2019s expression lightened at the sarcasm, his warm smile back, as if it had never faltered in the first place. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t think you could kick ass without it- just thought I\u2019d make it even easier for you.\u201d He sighed dramatically, leaning back on his palms. \u201cBut if you really don\u2019t want my advice, I get it- I\u2019m just some random loser you met yesterday-\u201c\n\u201cOh shut up,\u201d Tommy grinned, kicking at Quinn\u2019s feet. \u201cYou got third. That\u2019s not bad at all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll get first. Of course.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t expect anything less from the crowd favorite.\u201d\nTommy lightly smacked his shoulder, ears going a bit red. \u201c\u2018M not the favorite, man. Shut up.\u201d\nQuinn leaned away, hands held up in mock surrender. \u201cOkay, okay, kid. You\u2019re not. My bad.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right-\u201c\nThe bell sounded, signaling the final fight. \nThe grand finale.\nExcitement thrummed under his skin, and Tommy\u2019s fingers twitched in anticipation, ready to finally show everyone what he was capable of. He drew his sword, relishing in the surge of energy, the way his focus sharpened as Techno\u2019s enchantments flowed through him.\n\u201cWell, Q,\u201d Tommy declared, \u201cI\u2019m off to go kick some major ass. Wish me luck, man.\u201d With little else to say or do, he began a beeline for the gate, eyes already locked on the arena that lay behind.\nA gentle hand on his shoulder stopped him in his tracks, turning him back. Quinn gave him a small smile, and the hand on his shoulder a squeeze. \u201cJust- watch your back out there, alright?\u201d\nTommy flashed a bright grin in return. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, man. That bastard won\u2019t know what hit \u2018im.\u201d\nA laugh, but it was less bright than the ones that had come before it. \u201cOkay, Tommy. Good luck.\u201d\nIn front of them, the gate began to lift.\n\u201cGotta go!\u201d Tommy cheered, pulling away. \u201cI\u2019ll win for you!\u201d\nHe hefted the shield and scurried toward the gate, throwing a quick salute in his friend\u2019s direction before disappearing into the arena.\nQuinn watched him go, smile fading. He gingerly wrapped an arm back around his middle, fingers pressing against the bandages.\nThere was worry in his eyes.\n\u00a0\nThey strode out onto the sand, one behind the other. Tommy watched, eyes narrowed, as the man in front of him gave his sword a fancy twirl, the sun glinting off his armor. The other laughed in delight at the roar he got in response from the crowd, the sound dry and grating. Tommy immediately hated it.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m fighting the tournament \u2018golden boy\u2019, am I?\u201d The man jeered, already standing in the ring as Tommy approached.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if that was a really bad pun,\u201d Tommy snarked back, setting his sword on his shoulder, \u201cOr if you\u2019re just a dick.\u201d He cocked his head, shooting the other a cheeky grin. \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the second one.\u201d\nThe announcer\u2019s voice rang throughout the stadium, interrupting the insults. \u201cFinalists, find your places in the ring.\u201d\nTommy obeyed, settling his feet into the sand across from his opponent.\n\u201cOnce the bell tolls, the fight will commence. All rules remain the same. Whoever wins will be offered up as our victor, and the one worthy of gaining the favor of our gods.\u201d\nTommy laughed under his breath. Been there, done that, bitch.\n\u201cMay the gods bless you, and may you claim victory!\u201d\nThe bell rang.\nAt first, neither of them moved.\nTommy adjusted the grip on the hilt of his sword, hefting his shield a little higher. Both of them scrutinized the other, trying to predict who would strike first.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Tommy called, mocking. He gestured to himself. \u201cYou gonna fight me or not, bitch?\u201d\nThe man across from him grinned wickedly. \u201cIf you insist, I suppose I will.\u201d\nHe lunged.\nTommy sidestepped, feet skidding in the sand. He spun just in time to catch a second attack, parrying with the shield while striking back with his own weapon. His opponent danced back in turn, and they separated once again, prowling around the circle. Two lions in a cage, waiting for an opportunity.\nApparently, the man found one. \nHe came at Tommy with a yell, swinging his sword down over his head in a move that could cleave someone clear in half. Tommy threw his shield arm above his head, ducking as the other\u2019s blade glanced off of its surface, the impact jarring. While the other was recovering, Tommy moved out from under the shield, darting past him and slashing at his calf- not enough to cripple, but plenty enough to hurt.\nThere was a string of curses behind him, and Tommy grinned, spinning back. This time, he was the one to make the first move.\nHe feinted to the right, diving forward while his opponent fumbled to block it, and slammed the shield into the man\u2019s front. While he recovered, Tommy swung again, steel singing through the air, but it was caught in a furious clash of metal. Their blades stayed locked, a stalemate of push and pull.\nTommy relented first, but the other followed, coming at him with unrestrained brutality. The repeated crash of their blades rang in Tommy\u2019s ears, sweat dripping into his eyes. He countered every swing, blocking in turn with his shield and sword.\n(He made a mental note to thank Quinn later.)\nOne of the next jabs slipped off the blade of his sword when he tried to parry, getting in a shallow slash on his upper arm. Tommy grunted, gritting his teeth at sting. He dropped the attempt at offense, relying on the shield to keep him safe while he dodged and slipped around the wild, frenzied attacks coming his way.\nI need to finish this, Tommy thought, ducking under another swing. What do I know that I can use against him?\nThe man swung again, aiming high on Tommy\u2019s shoulder, and he parried in the nick of time. Another swing, lower. A flick of the wrist, and it was blocked.\n\nThis guy really doesn\u2019t let up, holy shit-\n\nHe ducked again, scrabbling through the sand, using the shield to steady himself. Even so, he felt a blade scrape deep against the brace on his sword arm.\nSo he\u2019s eager, he thought desperately, lashing out with a piercing sort of blow, which was knocked away. Let\u2019s use that against him, yeah?\nTommy pulled back, running to the opposite side of the ring. He planted his feet, digging them into the sand. A glance down revealed where they were placed- only inches away from the red barrier line. \n\nPlease let this work-\n\n\u201cOi! Dickhead!\u201d Tommy yelled, panting. \u201cCome at me, bitch!\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure!\u201d the man snarled, eyes burning as he raised his sword and charged.\nTommy threw up his shield, interlocking it with the sword, bracing for impact. The next swing slammed into him, the blow so powerful he felt it travel up his arms, rattling his bones. With gritted teeth, Tommy held his ground, pushing back against each jarring strike. His heels slid in the sand, inching closer and closer to the red line.\nThe man didn\u2019t stop, raining down blow after blow. Tommy strained, arms aching under the constant assault. One more second, I need to hold out for just one more second-\nHis opponent reeled back for a particularly harsh blow, one Tommy knew would topple him if it landed. With split-second precision, he waited until the other had already begun to move before flinging himself to the side. \nStartled, but carried by the momentum, his opponent lurched past him. Tommy hefted his shield and rammed into the other\u2019s back, overbalancing him into the dirt.\nOutside of the line.\nTommy stepped back, letting sword and shield fall to his sides, trying to catch his breath. He let himself relax, a relieved smile creeping over his face.\nThe bell rang for the final time.\nThe screams of the crowd were absolutely deafening, echoing down from every seat, filling the air with a writhing, electric energy. Tommy laughed, elation bubbling in his chest.\nHe\u2019d won.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he noticed his opponent getting up, pushing out of the sand. Tommy turned to him, giving a friendly smile, despite the lingering resentment for what the guy had done to Quinn. \u201cYou fought really well,\u201d Tommy admitted, still grinning, \u201cBetter than I expected, honestly- but still-\u201c\n\u201cShut up,\u201d the man wheezed, glaring.\nTommy blinked, somewhat surprised at the open hostility in his tone. \u201cAlright\u2026 well, there\u2019s no need to be a prick about it-\u201c\nHands reached out, grasping onto the edge of the shield and yanking, the motion ripping at his arm. Caught completely off guard, Tommy stumbled, barely managing to stay upright. His shoulder pulsed in protest.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d He gasped, incredulous, reeling back with sword raised. \u201cThe fight is over- You lost, man!\u201d\nThere was a horrifying glint in the man\u2019s eyes, something unstable and just plain wrong. \u201cI have not lost,\u201d he hissed, prowling forward, sword in hand. \u201cI am not meant to lose, especially not to a child such as yourself.\u201d\nTommy stepped back again to avoid a couple wild, sloppy slashes of the other\u2019s sword. \u201cListen, dickhead, it\u2019s already over- knock it off-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d the man sneered, trying to come close, but Tommy\u2019s own outstretched sword held him back. \u201cI refuse to yield.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a shit. Fuck off.\u201d Tommy lowered his sword, letting it hang at his side, annoyance festering in his chest. His shield stayed raised.\nThe man\u2019s sword glanced off of it.\n\u201cOi!\u201d\n\u201cFight me!\u201d He snarled, crazed. \u201cFight me, you coward.\u201d\nTommy retreated a few more steps. \u201cI just did,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd you fuckin\u2019 lost. So stop, please.\u201d\nThe man didn\u2019t listen, following him and lashing out with his sword once more, knocking Tommy\u2019s own from his hands. Tommy watched open-mouthed as it landed in the sand, feet away from him.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he snapped, glaring at the other, who stared at him, waiting for Tommy to strike back.\nWell, he wasn\u2019t going to. \nHe\u2019d won, the fight was over, and he wasn\u2019t gonna keep fighting this dick. He was tired, and he was done.\nIrritated, Tommy moved away, bending down to retrieve his sword. \u201cNot fucking cool, man,\u201d he muttered, scooping it out of the sand. \u201cJust try again next year like everyone else- god knows I won\u2019t be back after this-\u201c\nHe straightened with a huff, annoyed. There was a crunch of sand behind him, and Tommy sighed, reaching up to push the helmet out of his eyes with the heel of his hand. \n\nOh my gods- This prick really doesn\u2019t know when to quit, huh.\n\nHe turned. \u201cDude, seriously-\u201c\nThe words were abruptly cut off by a strained gasp as ice shot through his stomach. Tommy looked down, gaping at the blade protruding from his front, disappearing through his shirt- through him. But there was hardly time to comprehend it before he was on fire, a searing pain burning deep his gut, frying every nerve. With a loud clang, both sword and shield slipped from his grip, tumbling to the earth at his feet.\nThe sword was pulled back out.\nTommy staggered, the ringing in his ears drowning out the horrified screams of the crowd, world blurring together into a jumble of noise and nothing but burning pain. \nAnd oh fuck, it hurt.\nHe felt his knees buckle. The sky and ground blurred into a broken kaleidoscope of colors, yells and cries of distress sharp and muddled at the same time, all of it an incomprehensible mess. Warm sand suddenly pressed against his back, quickly turning into a sticky red mud that clung to his shirt. \nTommy tried to breathe, to force his chest to expand, but he was drowning. His lungs were full of iron and copper and he was drowning, he was burning and he couldn\u2019t fucking breathe-\nDistantly, someone was laughing.\nSomeone else screamed his name.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nDream watched, utterly petrified, as the blade slid through Tommy\u2019s front. The pride he had been feeling only moments before at Tommy\u2019s victory was gone.\nBone-deep terror replaced it.\nHe watched Tommy fall, the sound of the kid hitting the earth much too far away to hear, and yet the dull thump rang in his ears all the same. \nThe kid\u2019s opponent out a cackling laugh, moving to tower over Tommy in triumph, casting a shadow down upon him. Dream\u2019s stomach churned at the sound, rage building in his chest, drumming against his rib cage in time with his pounding heart. That asshole had just-\nDream\u2019s limbs unlocked, launching him out of the seat and toward the railing dividing audience from arena with a scream.\n\u201cTOMMY!\u201d\nHands tried to pull him back, but Dream was already in the air, over the railing and onto the arena floor, running. \n\u201cGet the hell away from him!\u201d he screamed, lunging at the laughing maniac, pushing him back from Tommy\u2019s crumpled form. The man just took the hit, backing away willingly, a deranged look of satisfaction in his face, crowing about victory or some twisted shit.\nDream fell to his knees beside the kid, hating the way they sunk into the already wet earth.\nOh god, Tommy-\n\nShit- no no no-\n\nTommy lay before him, eyes staring into the sky above, glazed over with pain, the golden helmet on his head a mocking sort of halo. Blood already soaked his front, dribbling from his lips with every choking cough. Dream reached out, pulling the helmet off, working to steady his trembling hands and failing miserably. He pressed them to pale cheeks, trying to get Tommy\u2019s attention.\n\u201cTommy- Tommy hey, look at me, buddy. Come on now, you gotta breathe, you gotta breathe kid- kid-\u201c\nHe slapped lightly at Tommy\u2019s face, trying to get his eyes to stay open. When that didn\u2019t work, he scooped the kid up, cradling him against his chest. Tommy was way too limp in his arms, head lolling as he tried to look at Dream. \u201cThat\u2019s right, look at me Tommy, in and out-\u201c\nTommy sobbed, trying to take in air, fingers digging into the front of his hoodie. He shook his head, shoving it desperately into Dream\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI- I can\u2019t Big D, it- it-\u201c \nHe was cut off by strangled cry as Dream pressed a hand uselessly to the front of the wound, trying to stop the bleeding. The hand slipped, blood bubbling between his fingers and soaking the earth.\nHe tried again, gasping, tears burning his eyes at the stupid fucking futility of it.\n\nI can\u2019t fucking save him- there\u2019s- there\u2019s too much-\n\nThis wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go.\nTommy was supposed to win. \nHe was supposed to be okay.\nOverhead, thunder rumbled.\nBehind him, the man laughed again, raising his arms up to the heavens.\n\u201cYou hear that?\u201d he cackled, manic. \u201cThe gods have come to bestow the spoils of my victory! After all these years they\u2019ve once again deemed someone worthy, and it is to be me! Me!\u201d\nDream ignored the mad ramblings, focused on the way Tommy\u2019s eyes were drooping shut, breaths beginning to peter out. \u201cTommy?\u201d he whispered, pressing at his cheek, smearing it with blood. \u201cKid, you can\u2019t close your eyes- you need to wake the hell up right now, come on-\u201c\nCome on, please you can\u2019t- you can\u2019t-\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me Tommy, please-\u201c\n\nI don\u2019t want to lose you.\n\nTommy blinked sluggishly, peering up at him through half-lidded eyes. \u201cDon\u2019 worry- \u2018bout me- Dream. \u2018M\u2026 jus\u2019 fine, Big Man, jus\u2019 fine-\u201c To prove his point, the kid smiled lazily at him, the expression more of a pained grimace than anything.\nHis teeth were red.\nDream gagged.\nThunder boomed again, lightning crackling as the sky darkened, the sun seeming to dim. The pressure dropped, Dream\u2019s ears popping. He grit his teeth and glanced over his shoulder at the bastard who had done this to Tommy, who was going to be dead the instant Dream got his hands on him\u2013\nHis eyes widened as the air around them all seemed to twist, nothingness warping with a flare of light and the shattering of an invisible windowpane. Three figures appeared behind the other man, all flowing robes and menacing aura, every molecule screaming otherworldly. \nDream held Tommy tighter.\nIf those useless gods wanted to give their blessing or whatever the hell to that motherfucker, fine. But if they wanted to get to the kid, wanted to do that fucker\u2019s bidding- they were going to have to go through him first.\nThe man turned to face the gods behind him, grinning from ear to ear. He bowed so low his forehead practically scraped the ground, smile wide and empty. \u201cThe Almighty, Your Excellences, I am honored to accept-\u201c\nHe stopped speaking as a blade settled against the back of his neck. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll be exceptin\u2019 is your death, you worthless little coward.\u201d\nDream watched, slack-jawed, as the Blood God himself loomed over the man, a wave of anger and disgust coming from the god so potent that it nearly made him sick. He stiffened as the eyes of another, the Siren, landed on him, narrowing. Those eyes bore into him, blazing a terrifying gold.\n\u201cPhil,\u201d the god said, not breaking eye contact. \nThe Siren\u2019s voice shook, but with what, Dream didn\u2019t know.\nThe Angel of Death turned his attention away from the pathetic, groveling excuse of a man in front of him, following the other god\u2019s gaze. Dream swallowed hard as shadowy wings flared at the sight of him hunched over Tommy\u2019s body, their span so immense they seemed to cover the sun.\n\nI am so incredibly fucked.\n\nThe Siren and the Angel moved toward him with an inhuman grace, Siren\u2019s gaze now locked on the kid in Dream\u2019s lap. He followed the look, heart stuttering at the paleness of Tommy\u2019s face. He- he couldn\u2019t tell if the kid was still breathing.\nGods, no. No-\n\u201cTommy?\u201d he whispered, voice breaking. \u201c\u2026Kid?\u201d\nThe temperature around him dropped even further, and he could feel a presence behind him, looming over his shoulder. Dream scrambled to his feet, holding Tommy to his chest. He spun to face the gods behind him, backing away with shaking legs.\n\u201cStay away,\u201d he snarled, pushing down the fear clawing at his chest, both from the fact that he was face to face with the gods, and that Tommy was awfully, awfully still in his arms. \u201cI won\u2019t let you touch him.\u201d\nSomething softened in the Angel\u2019s eyes, his wings drooping a bit. Siren, on the other hand, didn\u2019t stop, marching closer and closer, blazing gaze never leaving Tommy\u2019s face.\n\u201cStop,\u201d the god said, the sound ringing out, filling the air and invading Dream\u2019s limbs, forcing his feet to still. He strained in a panic, trying to get away as Siren drew closer. \n\nWhat the hell what the hell what the hell-\n\n\u201cGive him to me.\u201d\nHe glared at the deity. \u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cI said, give him to me.\u201d\nHelplessly, Dream watched as his arms betrayed him, giving up his hold on Tommy for the Siren to take with shockingly tender hands. He looked down at his own empty ones, slick with the blood of the closest thing he had to a little brother.\nFuck. Fuck. \n\nI think- I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\n\n\u201cPhil,\u201d Siren called shakily, \u201cPhil, he\u2019s not- he\u2019s not breathing-\u201d\nDream blinked, taken aback. \nFor a god, the fear in Siren\u2019s voice was something incredibly human.\n\u201cPHIL!\u201d\n\u201cHold on mate, just give me a second- Tech, bring that stupid fuck over here, will you?\u201c\nDream tore his eyes away from the blood on his hands, trying to ignore the way they shook. He watched dumbly as the Blood God dragged that fucking murderer over to where Siren was standing, the kid clutched to his chest. The god\u2019s forehead was pressed to Tommy\u2019s, eyes shut tight as he murmured something quiet and unintelligible. The Angel of Death hovered around them both.\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nThe Blood God threw the man at their feet. The Angel\u2019s wings spread, stretching to impossible heights, shrouding them all in darkness. The Angel set one hand over the heart of the man on the ground, the other over Tommy\u2019s bloody chest.\nEven through the gloom, Dream could make out the god\u2019s smile, something filled with a quiet rage and far, far more terrifying than anything he had ever seen.\nThe grin widened, sharp and unforgiving. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I make a little trade here, do you mate?\u201d\nDream stared at them, frozen in shock, his mind locked in a daze. Tommy\u2019s blood burned against his skin, hot and suffocating. He blinked, and the Angel\u2019s words finally processed. \n\nHoly shit, he was going to-\n\nHe stumbled back a step, so much fear in his chest he couldn\u2019t even tell what it was for at this point.\nThere was a piercing scream, followed by the darkness pulling in on itself. It felt like it was dragging its way through Dream\u2019s chest, stealing the air from his lungs to surround the trio of gods in a swirling mass of raw, aching power. His ears popped again, wind howling around him, gravity gone and everything was hot and cold at the same time-\nThe tugging sensation faded, leaving his chest feeling empty, energy drained. Dream staggered, gasping for air. The darkness surrounding them began to lift, and a more personal sort of black filled his vision, taking its place. He stumbled again, eyes rolling into the back of his head as the ground came up to meet him.\nBefore he sank into the depths of unconsciousness entirely, Dream hazily mourned the way he could still smell blood.\nThe marble against his back was cool to the touch, seeping through his robes. It was an interesting contrast to the warmth in front of him, the utterly relieving feeling of Tommy in his lap, cozy, safe, and breathing pulling most of his focus. He shifted slightly against the feet of his own statue, trying to reposition himself into something slightly more comfortable.\nWilbur had always been fascinated by how much more he felt things when in this form. In all his millennia, he had always been curious as to why mortals acted the way they did, always so passionate about everything. They hated deeply, hurt even deeper, and yet loved deepest of all.\nHe had spent years puzzling over it. Always trying so hard to understand, in spite of Techno\u2019s teasing or Phil\u2019s confusion over why he was so enraptured by the mortals so far beyond their home realm. And for all of his efforts, for all of the times he took a mortal form and let himself walk their streets, a god amongst men, he could never quite get it.\nBut then, Wilbur had met Tommy.\nLoud, unbearable, perfectly rude Tommy, who was the most fascinating, most spontaneous, most passionately kind and wonderful human he had ever met.\nAnd then Tommy died. His soul- the one Phil claimed was the brightest he had seen in centuries- dimmed. Flame extinguished, chest still and hollow, limp in his arms.\nAnd Wilbur-\nWilbur had finally understood.\nNow, he lightly traced a thumb over Tommy\u2019s cheek, thanking the stars and Lady Fate herself for Phil\u2019s abilities, for this second chance. He cradled Tommy in his lap, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest, the little gremlin deep asleep.\nTechno sat beside him, staring off into space, having already done his fair share of fretting as they took Tommy\u2019s unconscious body from the arena and back to the temple. Phil had checked his work, ensuring that the trade had worked properly before retreating back to their own realm. Wilbur didn\u2019t blame him- a spell of that caliber on the mortal plane took an incredible amount of energy. Phil would be able to recover much faster in their own world, and he had reluctantly forced himself to retreat.\nWilbur\u2019s eyes skipped away from Tommy\u2019s face, landing on the fourth and final person occupying the city temple\u2019s central atrium. \nThe other mortal. \nTommy\u2019s friend, the one in that horrible green sweatshirt that the child had pointed out of the first day of the tournament. The one who had held Tommy first, had comforted him as he died when Wilbur couldn\u2019t get there soon enough, when he and Techno were to busy panicking and fetching Phil.\nAs little as Wilbur knew about the man, there would always be a spot of gratitude in his heart for what he had done. Maybe both of them had been too late to save Tommy to begin with, but the other had kept his Tommy from dying alone. That was something Wilbur was never, ever going to forget. Not now, not in a million years.\nSo they had brought the man with them, waiting for him to come back around.\nAs if he could sense Wilbur\u2019s gaze, the mortal shifted on the stone floor, letting out a quiet groan. He watched curiously as the man\u2019s fingers twitched, limbs flailing a bit as his breaths quickened, mind coming back to the world of the waking.\nThe mortal suddenly awoke with a gasp, eyes snapping open. Wilbur watched patiently as he looked around the room, palms scrabbling against the polished floor, confused and panicked. Finally, the frantic gaze landed on Tommy, lying peacefully in Wilbur\u2019s lap, and the other relaxed, letting out a quiet sigh of relief at the sight of Tommy\u2019s chest rising and falling.\nThe mortal\u2019s eyes then flickered up to Wilbur\u2019s face, and the other stiffened once again. Wilbur was forced to bite back a laugh at the fear there, watching the stranger glance back and forth between the statues looming above them and his actual face.\n\u201cI\u2019m a lot more handsome in person, I know,\u201d he said with a smirk, one that widened when the mortal jumped. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit startling at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\nThe man didn\u2019t say anything, just opened and closed his mouth wordlessly, eyes skipping over to Techno as well, who watched on with interest.\nWilbur leaned forward, trying to soften the look on his face as the mortal\u2019s breathing picked up, anxiety evident in his eyes. \u201cRelax,\u201d he said quietly, trying to calm the man\u2019s nerves, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you. In fact, you\u2019re under my protection, actually.\u201d\n\u201cW-what?\u201d The man gasped, staring at him with wide eyes.\n\u201cYou protected and cared about something of mine,\u201d Wilbur replied, nodding down at Tommy, peacefully resting against his chest. \u201cSo in return, you have our gratitude.\u201d\nThe mortal\u2019s eyes darted between him and Techno, and a hand came up to grasp the front of his awful hoodie. \u201c...Yours?\u201d \nWilbur hummed in confirmation, nodding again. He continued gently tracing Tommy\u2019s cheek with his thumb. His.\nThe mortal sat up further, tracking the subtle movement, something calculating in the narrowing of his eyes. \u201cYours,\u201d he repeated, a subtle snarl, something defensive to the words. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve fucking- claimed him, or something?\u201d\nHonestly, Wilbur was impressed by that one.\n\nIt\u2019s not everyday that you meet a mortal with enough guts to pick a fight with the Gods themselves.\n\n\nNo wonder he and Tommy get along.\n\nWilbur cocked his head. \u201cYou could put it that way, I suppose. Not sure that\u2019s what I\u2019d use, but it\u2019s a decent way to put it.\u201d\nThe mortal\u2019s hands twitched at that, a scowl heavy on his face despite the lingering wariness in his stance. \u201cKid wins the tournament, and what?\u201d he spat, \u201cYou save him to uphold your little rules, to prove to all of us mortals that we\u2019re nothing- and suddenly he\u2019s yours now? Are you kidding?\u201d\nWilbur blinked, taken aback. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit more personal than that.\u201d\nThe mortal hesitated, hostile posture loosening for a moment. \u201c...Personal?\u201d\nThere was a snort to his right, and both of them looked over at Techno, who looked amused, of all things. Techno chuckled. \u201cYou really think we\u2019d care this much about any old contestant? Of course it\u2019s personal.\u201d\nWhen the only response was a quizzical look, Techno shrugged. \u201cThe kid\u2019s family. Simple as that.\u201d\nThe poor man looked incredibly lost at that, even more than he had before. \u201cI- I\u2019m sorry- what?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what?\u2019 You\u2019re close to Tommy, I can see that now,\u201d Techno scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re actin\u2019 like he\u2019s never mentioned us to you before.\u201d\nThe man just stared at them.\n\u201c...He did mention us, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d the other cried desperately, looking rapidly back and forth between the two gods and Tommy\u2019s sleeping form, confused and lost in every sense of the word. \u201cI- what the fuck? What the in literal hell?\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Techno said, leaning back. \nWilbur watched the whole exchange, smile tugging at the edge of his lips. Of course Tommy wouldn\u2019t tell his friend about them. Of course not, the idiot.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Wilbur said casually, carefully adjusting his hold on Tommy. \u201cI don\u2019t think we ever did introductions. You can call me Wilbur,\u201d he gestured lazily at Techno, \u201cAnd this is Technoblade.\u201d\n\u201cDream,\u201d the mortal uttered weakly, staring at them, looking so lost as he tried to process everything that was happening. Dream pulled his knees up to his chest, and let his head fall into his hands. \u201cWhat the hell is even going on right now?\u201d He groaned into his palms.\nWilbur snickered. \u201cNice to meet you again, Dream,\u201d He tilted his head, analyzing. \u201cYou\u2019re taking most of this rather well. I\u2019m pretty impressed.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d came the muffled, deadpan reply.\nTechno snorted, and Wilbur looked over at him, smiling at the amusement on the other\u2019s face.\nThen, Techno\u2019s face scrunched up, Wilbur\u2019s words finally starting to process. \u201cWait- what do you mean, again?\u201d He turned to Wilbur, brow furrowed. \u201cWhen have you met him before?\u201d\nWilbur stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\u201c...No?\u201d\n\u201cTechno,\u201d he sighed, resisting the urge to let go of Tommy and copy Dream. \u201cWe literally sat by him during the tournament. You had a whole argument that you wouldn\u2019t shut up about- are you serious?\u201d\n\u201c...Oh,\u201d Techno said, looking back at Dream. Wilbur saw the moment the realization finally hit. \u201cOh. Wait-\u201c Techno sat up straight, finally putting all the pieces together. \u201cDoes that mean we were both cheerin\u2019 for Tommy at the same time? This whole time?\u201d\nDream lifted his head, confused. Still. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nInstead of explaining, Wilbur just shot him a wicked grin, snapping his fingers. His robes shifted, changing into a soft yellow shirt, a beanie appearing in his hair. Dream\u2019s jaw dropped.\n\u201cOh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d \nWilbur cackled, the looks on their faces absolutely priceless.\nDream scrambled to his feet, pointing an accusatory finger his way. \u201cThat was you? This whole time?\u201d He wheeled on Techno, glaring. \u201cAnd you! We were both cheering for Tommy, for all three rounds! Why the hell did you make it into a competition?\u201d\nTechno threw up his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a god!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what? Maybe I put on my wrong pair of glasses that day, alright?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense-\u201c\nA quiet groan came from Wilbur\u2019s lap, and he froze, glancing down as Tommy shifted. He made another quiet sound, pressing his face into Wilbur\u2019s chest.\n\u201cOi! You two!\u201d Wilbur cut in, interrupting the useless- but admittedly entertaining- bickering. Dream and Techno stopped, looking over at him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s waking up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe world came back to him slowly, everything fuzzy and warm.\nGroggily, Tommy could just make out the feeling of arms wrapped around him, the sensation of someone holding him close. Beneath his shoulder, a chest rose and fell, one of his arms pinned by the hold. He could feel it beginning to tingle, needles prickling at his fingertips. Tommy couldn\u2019t bring himself to mind.\nBelatedly, he noticed that his other hand was also occupied, not by numbness, but being held in someone else\u2019s. He stirred a bit, trying to free his arm and pry heavy eyelids open, and the hand squeezed, comforting.\nIt just felt so, so-\n\nSafe.\n\n\nMaybe he could drift off again- No one would mind if he stayed like this for a teeny bit longer, right?\n\n\u201cTommy?\u201d A voice called, soft and melodic. The sound rumbled in the chest beneath his cheek, coming from the one holding him. \u201cYou awake, Toms?\u201d\nWilbur.\nTommy held incredibly still, knowing full well Wil would probably still hold him even if he was awake, if he asked, but this was nice, and he didn\u2019t want to ruin it.\n\u201cI think he might still be out.\u201d The hand in his squeezed again, gentle. \u201cCome on, kid. It\u2019s time to get up.\u201d\nThat voice made him pause, brow furrowing. \nWhat the hell was Dream doing here?\nHe remembered getting stabbed, the pain, crying, pleading, even. And then Dream was holding him, his friend\u2019s tears mixing with his own and the blood on his face-\nThen it had all gone fuzzy. Dark.\nThen light. A bright, empty expanse, and endless wasteland of nothing. In every direction, blankness as far as the eye could see.\nSome might\u2019ve called it peaceful- maybe even beautiful. To Tommy, it had just felt lonely.\nBut to his relief, that had only lasted a few moments, before the darkness began to trickle in again and something was tugging at his chest- pulling through his heart and forcing it to beat once more.\nAnd after that, well-\nHe woke up here. Warm, safe in Wil\u2019s arms.\nWhich didn\u2019t make any sense. How did he get here? Well, actually, no- that was an easy one. One of them definitely carried him here. \nBut then, how was Dream here too? \nThey didn\u2019t know each other. At least- they weren\u2019t supposed to.\nA hand settled in his hair, threading through it with methodical fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely fakin\u2019, I can tell.\u201d\nIt appeared Techno was here too.\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nCuriosity and confusion got the better of him, and Tommy pried open an eye, pulling his face out of Wilbur\u2019s chest. Everyone swam into focus, the faces of all three peering down at him, a precarious mixture of relief, worry, and unbridled joy all at once.\n\u201c\u2018The fuck are you all lookin\u2019 at?\u201d He croaked, squinting up at them. \u201cYou never seen a dead person before?\u201d\nThe somewhat pleasant mood dampened instantly, and both holds on him tightened, protective as ever. Techno\u2019s gaze darkened, and Wilbur scowled. Something akin to grief flashed in Dream\u2019s eyes, hurt written all over his face.\nTommy cringed internally at the reaction. A bit too soon for jokes, I guess.\n\u201cMy bad,\u201d he mumbled, pushing against Wilbur to sit up, the god helping him along, \u201cForgot comedy in a crisis situation isn\u2019t always appreciated in this house. Fuckin\u2019 nightmare, this place is.\u201d\nSomebody huffed out a faint laugh, and Tommy smiled, leaning back into Wilbur, who happily took the weight. \u201cSo what, you\u2019ve all just been sitting around, waiting for me to wake up like total creeps?\u201d\nDream shrugged, the hand not holding his reaching up to fiddle with the strings on that ugly hoodie of his. One that was miraculously free of blood, now. Probably Wil\u2019s doing. \u201cPretty much.\u201d\n\u201cTook you long enough to wake up,\u201d Wilbur complained, snaking an arm around his middle, chin dropping over his shoulder. \u201cYou little prick.\u201d\nDespite the faux annoyance in his voice, Tommy could easily pick out the left over anxiety in it, proving the fact that some part of Wilbur had probably been waiting for him to not wake up at all. \nConsidering he had fucking died, (he was still trying to wrap his head around that bit, honestly) Tommy really couldn\u2019t blame the god.\nHe patted Wilbur\u2019s arm reassuringly, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Big Dubs, I\u2019m good. Wonderful, actually. Never felt better rested, honestly-\u201c\n\u201cYou died, Tommy,\u201d Techno cut in, voice flat. \u201cStop pretending that we weren\u2019t worried for good reason.\u201d\nThe rambles died on Tommy\u2019s tongue, smile slipping away.\nOh. They were actually being serious about all this.\nAlright.\n\u201cI second that,\u201d Dream said, and Tommy\u2019s gaze flicked over to his, locking eyes with him. The other tried to smile at him, but it was a weak, wobbly thing. \u201cKid, you-\u201c Dream choked a bit in the words, and Tommy watched wide-eyed as his friend suddenly teared up. \u201cYou died in my arms, Tommy. You know that you- that I- I had to hold you as you-\u201c He shook his head, looking away, gaze unfocused as he stared at something far beyond the polished stone of the temple.\nThis time, Tommy was the one to do the hand squeezing.\n\u201cI know you just woke up and everything,\u201d his friend whispered, \u201cBut please don\u2019t brush it all off already, not when it\u2019s us. Not when we care about you this much.\u201d Dream looked back, giving him a watery smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay, you know?\u201d\nTommy stared at him, then glanced over at Techno, at Wilbur. They all wore similar expressions, ones full of hastily mended heartbreak and a shit ton of love that Tommy didn\u2019t really know what to do with. \nHe felt himself take a shaky breath, not entirely sure why he felt unsteady all of a sudden. \u201cOkay,\u201d he murmured, looking back at Dream, who shot him a grateful smile that was quickly returned.\nThe whole dying thing hadn\u2019t really processed yet. Maybe it would hit him in a couple hours, maybe a week from now. Maybe it never would. \nEven so, Tommy knew-\nThey\u2019d be there for him when it did.\nAnd that was enough.\n\u201cOn a lighter note,\u201d Techno began, cutting through the lingering heaviness in the air. \u201cYou know that loser at the tournament I was gonna tell you about?\u201d\nTommy blinked, still trying to absorb the last few moments, but nodded anyway. He wasn\u2019t sure where this was going.\nTechno huffed out a laugh. \u201cTurns out, it was this guy all along.\u201d He jabbed a thumb in Dream\u2019s direction, grinning. \u201cIdiot didn\u2019t even realize we were all rootin\u2019 for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy asked, confused.\n\u201cOkay, first of all,\u201d Dream interrupted, pointing an accusatory finger in Techno\u2019s direction. \u201cI resent that. Secondly, you\u2019re a god, dude. If anything, you and Wilbur here should\u2019ve figured it out, not me.\u201d\nTechno shrugged, crossing his arms. \u201cStill a loser though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Tommy piped up, watching the two snark back and forth. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? How the hell did you all meet each other? What am I missing here?\u201d\nBehind him, Wil chuckled quietly. \u201cThese two idiots,\u201d he said, amused, \u201cSat next to each other in the stands for the entire tournament and didn\u2019t realize they were both cheering for you until about an hour ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, neither did you until now, Wilbur,\u201d Techno defended.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Wilbur said, voice smug. He leaned back against the statues behind them, taking Tommy with him, pressing their heads together. \u201cI realized after Tommy pointed him out after the first round,\u201d he shrugged, nonchalant, \u201cI knew they were friends, just not how close.\u201d\nTechno and Dream gaped at him, betrayal written all over their faces.\n\u201cSo you knew I was Tommy\u2019s friend and still insulted my hoodie?\u201d Dream complained, offended. \u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d\nTommy snickered at the looks on their faces, and he could feel Wil\u2019s smile widen. \n\u201cWhat can I say,\u201d the god said with another shrug, \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking horrendous color.\u201d\n\u201cTold you,\u201d Tommy sang, snickering. \nDream pouted, but it was half-hearted, a twinkle to his eye. \u201cFine then,\u201d he snapped jokingly, pulling his arms through the sleeves. \u201cIf you love it so much-\u201c\n\u201cWhat are you-\u201c\n\u201cThen you wear it,\u201d Dream finished, yanking it over his head with an evil grin. Before Tommy could react, he was hit in the face with an eye-searing bundle of neon green.\nWilbur and Techno snickered as Tommy floundered, cursing as he pulled the thing off his face. \u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 serious?\u201d He asked, and there was a genuine sincerity to the question.\n\u201cDead,\u201d Dream replied, deadpan.\nTommy pulled away from Wil, slipping the hoodie over his head, grumbling. \u201cSo he can make death jokes but I can\u2019t? Fuckin\u2019 unbelievable-\u201c\nThis time, there was laughter.\nTommy popped his head out of the fabric and smiled, leaning back again as Wilbur shook with giggles behind him.\nThere would be a lot of shit to figure out- that was for sure. Coming to terms with his own death, dealing with the general public (that was going to be hell, he just knew), letting both sides of his strange family get used to each other.\n(Though to be honest, he wasn\u2019t really worried about that last one.)\nBut for now, he was breathing. His heart beat in his chest, protected by something warm and golden brought by the laughter of those he cared about the most.\nThings would be okay.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nA few days later, Tommy stood alone in the temple\u2019s central chamber. The ever-familiar statues loomed above him, and he rocked back on his heels, paying no mind to the quill in his hand, slowly dripping ink onto the floor. He squinted, calculating.\nIf he climbed the statues just the right way, he\u2019d be able to reach Wilbur\u2019s cheek with the tip of the quill pen. The current plan was to draw a massive dick, but who knows. Maybe he\u2019d get more creative once he was up there.\nHe snickered to himself, the sound echoing throughout the eerily empty room. Tommy had lived in his little alcove for years, and never once had the temple been this quiet- this empty.\nIt was rather nice, actually. Peaceful, easy to get around, and no one to stop some mild vandalism. You know, the important stuff.\nEver since the Tournament, things had been... different, to say the least. The gods and Dream were a pleasant constant, always checking up on him, spending time with him, the two sides of his life slowly coming together into one beautiful, chaotic whole. But everyone else in the city, well- they weren\u2019t so casual about the whole thing.\nTommy hadn\u2019t left the temple hardly at all, in the few days that it\u2019s been since the Tournament. People were just too weird about it. They cast him all sorts of looks: awe, fear, bitterness or jealousy. The whole city was in a minor uproar, a near mirror image of the incident with Wilbur a few years back. Except this time, there was one major difference.\nThe Temple remained empty.\nTommy wasn\u2019t sure if it was out of fear, out of respect for the fact that some people began to pick up on just how much time he spent there, or if Wil and Techno had done something to keep unwanted people out. He didn\u2019t really care the reason- the lack of swarming people meant that the city temple became Tommy\u2019s sanctuary, a respite from everything and everyone as he adjusted from being unknown to unforgettable.\nDream said he\u2019d learn how to deal with it all, the fame and the attention. Tommy believed his friend, but some part of him still wished things would just hurry up and quiet down already. \nHe set one foot on the marble dais and prepared to climb.\n\u201c...Tommy?\u201d A voice called from behind, soft and hesitant.\nHe startled, dropping the quill and spattering ink all over the floor. Whoops. Tommy glanced over his shoulder, curious as to who the hell had finally bothered to come in here.\nQuinn.\n\nReally should\u2019ve expected that one sooner or later.\n\n\u201cHey Big Man,\u201d Tommy replied, smiling, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\nQuinn stepped further into the room, looking around nervously, as if he felt out of place. \u201cI was looking for you,\u201d he said quietly, coming over to Tommy\u2019s side, looking at him with an unfamiliar expression on his face. \u201cI saw what happened through the gate- well, most of it at least,\u201d he cringed, expression turning sorrowful. \u201cI just- I wanted to make sure you were actually okay. That the whole... miracle, or whatever wasn\u2019t just some crazy dream. People told me to come here,\u201d Quinn smiled weakly over at him. \u201cAnd here you are.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Here I am,\u201d Tommy agreed, stuffing his hands into the pocket of the hoodie he wore. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve never been better, really.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Quinn asked, a hint of familiar amusement in his voice. \u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d\nTommy grinned. \u201cWell I\u2019m fucking famous now, aren\u2019t I? Kicked that bastard\u2019s ass, won the tournament, and even got a sick scar out of it to boot.\u201d He pulled one hand from his pocket, lifting the hem of his shirt to expose the silvery, rope-like scar running across his stomach, its twin on his back.\nQuinn glanced at it for a moment, and Tommy let his shirt drop. \u201cSo they really had to heal you, huh,\u201d he observed quietly, looking up at the statues in front of them.\nTommy just shrugged, not feeling like making a big deal out of details right now. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d Quinn said quietly, not looking Tommy\u2019s way. \u201cI kept feeling like- I don\u2019t know,\u201d he huffed, frustrated. \u201cLike I should\u2019ve done more, somehow.\u201d\nTommy shrugged again. \u201cNot your fault, Q. There was nothing you could\u2019ve done.\u201d\nA little bit of the tension fell from Quinn\u2019s shoulders, and he ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI guess,\u201d he muttered.\nSilence fell between the two of them- not quite awkward, but more so the silence of two people who weren\u2019t quite sure how to fit into the other\u2019s life anymore, now that things weren\u2019t quite so simple. They stood there, quietly staring at the statues in front of them, slowly trying to warm back up to one another.\n\u201cSo did they like- bless you, or anything?\u201d Quinn asked timidly, glancing at him out of the corner of his eye, almost as if he was a bit scared to pry. \u201cFor winning?\u201d\nTommy snickered, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, you mean beside the whole,\u201d he gestured at his front, \u201cResurrection shit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Quinn agreed, looking a little awkward, but laughing nonetheless. \u201cBesides that.\u201d\nTommy hummed, tilting his head. \u201cNope. It\u2019s totally cool though- I just like being alive. That\u2019s fuckin\u2019 good enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d His former partner craned his neck, looking up at the regal, stoic statues before him. A faint smile appeared on Quinn\u2019s face, and he shook his head, laughing to himself. \u201cDon\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised. Only you would brush off the idea of being blessed by the gods, Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tommy began slowly, following Quinn\u2019s gaze, taking in the familiar faces before him, the ones that lacked the warmth and love he knew so well. A silent, faded reminder of what he truly had. Of how lucky he really was. Absent-mindedly, his fingers twisted around the strings of the neon hoodie he wore.\nTommy stared up at the statues.\nThey stared back.\nHe smiled.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m plenty blessed as it is, Big Man.\u201d"
