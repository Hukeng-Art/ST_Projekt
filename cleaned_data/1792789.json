    "text": "Heaven is in an uproar.\nOf course, Heaven is always in some sort of uproar, so usually Castiel doesn\u2019t pay much attention. He doesn\u2019t much have the mind for politics, he is more of the type who liked to have enemies pointed out to him so that he could stick them with something pointy.\nBut this is a special uproar, the uproar of the millennium.\nThis is the day that marked the Holy and Blessed Union of Dean Winchester and Jo Harvelle.\nThe merging of prominent bloodlines is always a grand occurrence, but breeding pedigree hunter families like Winchester and Harvelle is something to be rejoiced. It is also something to be meticulously planned, which thankfully the Host is very good at.\nDean Winchester and Jo Harvelle will meet at the Harvelle\u2019s drinking establishment, just as has been intended since the two of them were mere scraps of ideas. There, a preselected putto will be waiting with a celestial arrow to strike the rapturous chord between them, sparking an immediate and intense romantic and sexual interest. After that they will fornicate and produce two sons who will eventually be the Michael Sword and Lucifer\u2019s Vessel, if all goes according to plan. Which it usually does when the all masses of Heaven are striving towards it.\nCastiel finds the entire thing incredibly dull, and wishes that someone would point him towards something to stab.\nThe putto selected to stir their respective loins is one with an exemplary track record. All of his marks were targeted, shot, and married within the month, and even Castiel is impressed with the fact that none of his charges went crazy and killed each other after a few years. Humans have a nasty habit of doing that, with their silly biology and uncooperative neural chemicals getting in the way of divine destiny.\nCastiel knows that his arrows are strong, his bow is flexible, and his aim is true. All of the Choirs in all of the Spheres are watching with baited breath, Power and Principality alike, and even the warrior Seraphim like himself have been pulled from their battles to keep their eyes on the joyous and wondrous meeting of Dean Winchester and Jo Harvelle, whose children will bring about the end of days.\nBalthazar slides into nonexistence beside him, incorporeal wings buzzing with excitement.\nCASTIEL, he says cheerfully, TODAY HISTORY IS MADE.\nCastiel wonders how history can be made when this is predetermined and they are angels and history and time are fluid concepts. He says nothing because he\u2019s been reliably informed that he is a party pooper.\nOn the mortal plane, Sam and Dean Winchester break into a bar. They split up. The barrel of a shotgun is pressed against the older brother\u2019s back.\nThe entire Host watches, enraptured. The putto, unseen by the humans, draws his bow and aims, celestial arrow shining and singing with the manifest of Love; motor oil and new leather, the taste of whiskey, the feeling of rolling a bullet between your fingers, the scent of homemade apple pie and the sound of a mother\u2019s laughter carrying down a warm hallway. These are the things that mean Love to Dean Winchester, and he\u2019s about to get shot full of them.\nBROTHERS AND SISTERS, Raphael breathes reverently,WITNESS THIS, THE UNION OF OUR FATHER\u2019S GLORY.\nWinchester twists, grabbing the shotgun. Harvelle punches him in the face. The putto looses his arrow.\nIt sticks Winchester right in the chest, and they all feel what Dean feels the moment it connects; the awed, amazed, powerfully overwhelming pain of getting punched in the fucking face. The arrow, still unseen by the two mortals, stays lodged in Dean\u2019s chest instead of dissolving into his soul like it should have. Instead of absorbing that feeling of Love, Winchester is just surprised.\nSo is every single angel in the entirety of Heaven.\nThis is unprecedented. The putto stares in horrified shock, his marks very much not in love. Chaos erupts. In the Second Sphere, the Hashmallim immediately begin screaming for order and for some sort of answer. Castiel and the other Seraphim withdraw from the tumult with a sort of lame numbness.\nSHOOT HIM AGAIN, Castiel\u2019s immediate superior, Seraphiel, shouts, and apparently that is the most logical order given because the putto quickly readies his bow and fires another arrow. Again, it lands and sticks but there is no change. Dean Winchester\u2019s soul is markedly unaffected.\nThere is a very long, very painful moment of silence. All Choirs cease movement and murmur. Sam Winchester is held at gunpoint by Ellen Harvelle. Dean Winchester is decidedly not in love. Thousands upon thousands of years of carefully laid plans crash down on them.\nWELL SHIT, Raphael says finally.\nCastiel thinks that that most adequately sums up the situation.\n------------\nAfter the shock and horror subside, it becomes kind of funny.\nFunny in that way where it\u2019s not funny at all, but Castiel knows that if they don\u2019t try to find the humor in something then the malakhim will instead turn to rage and smite a large city or two.\nCastiel is voting for Chicago, personally.\nThere will be other vessels for Michael and Lucifer, eventually. The higher-ups have already plotted and planned for the next great union, as sort of a back-up plan. Obviously, the hopes are that one day the arrows still stuck in Dean Winchester will absorb like they\u2019re meant and the apocalypse will be back on schedule, if a bit later than originally planned.\nThe putto assigned to them had turned in his bow and is now glumly playing guardian to some chapel or something in a human city called Rome. It is a big step down, and Castiel pities him.\nHowever, dozens of other angels have taken up his mantel, each determined that their arrow will be the one that causes Dean Winchester to fall in love with Joanna Harvelle. Some have even taken to shooting her, just to see if it changes anything, though it was always meant to be Dean who fell first.\nIt\u2019s almost a game. Let\u2019s see how long Dean Winchester can walk around looking like a celestial pincushion.\nEven Balthazar takes a crack at it, telling Castiel cheekily, I HAVE EXPERIENCE INSERTING THINGS INTO HUMANS FOR PLEASURE.\nHe fails, of course, but no one was actually expecting him to succeed, himself included.\nEventually some angel, probably a cherub, ups the ante by taking a vessel and trying to matchmake Winchester and Harvelle the old fashioned way. Or, rather, the human way, since technically angels are far more old fashioned.\nShe flirts with Winchester while in the presence of Harvelle to try and stimulate jealousy. This fails, as the two hunters are closing in on a vampire nest together and neither of them have the patience to pay attention to a random bar bunny.\nIt starts up a new round in their game though, and suddenly there are a lot more humans running around with amnesia because the angels are grabbing vessels left and right to try and push Dean and Jo together.\nSorath sends Jo flowers with a card signed with Dean\u2019s name. She calls him to confirm the delivery is his, he says its not, and they burn the flowers as ingredients for a spell.\nDinial takes the form of an infant and poses as the orphaned child of a victim of a poltergeist, in hopes that the two hunters will care for it together. Dean dumps the infant off on Jo, who dumps the infant off on her mother, who dumps the infant off on Bobby Singer, who it turns out possesses a fantastic singing voice and knowledge of a variety of different lullabies.\nNothing works.\nThe closest they get is after Virgil snarls, SOFT FOOLS, PASSION IS BORN IN BATTLE and tricks the two of them into a skinwalker ambush. Winchester and Harvelle shoot and slice and bleed together, back-to-back, and again the Host watches avidly as they dance around each other, every bit the perfect hunters to breed the perfect vessels.\nThey fornicate afterwards, and there is brief jubilation, but it\u2019s just as quickly gone when Castiel\u2019s brothers and sisters realize that the celestial arrows are all still firmly intact in both of the humans. Not a shred of Love has absorbed.\nIT IS MY UNDERSTANDING, says Aziraphale, an eccentric principality who has lived as a human for several centuries and owns a bookshop, and is therefore Heaven\u2019s leading expert in human culture, THAT FORNICATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY EQUATE TO LOVE. THEY COULD HAVE SEX AND STILL BE ENTIRELY EMOTIONALLY PLATONIC.\nThere is a resounding groan of despair.\nCastiel thinks that they are all being a little silly, and should just move on.\n------------\nYOU SHOULD TAKE A CRACK AT IT, CASSIE, Balthazar tells him thoughtfully.\n\nI WOULD RATHER ROLL IN GOAT DUNG.\n\nSO SERIOUS! NO ONE EXPECTS IT TO WORK ANYMORE. WHY NOT HAVE A LITTLE FUN? THE PUTTI HAVE TAKEN TO USING THE TWO WAYWARD HUMANS AS TARGET PRACTICE.\nCastiel flexes his feathers, banishing a demon who was about to possess a pregnant woman from existence. He contemplates it.\nAll malakhim of every Choir or Garrison have the ability to manifest swords and bows and to will arrows of celestial intent into existence. The putti are just the class who are assigned the roles of matchmakers, like the Seraphim are assigned the role of warrior. Each has the capacity, if not the strength necessary, to fight or wield either weapon.\nIf given the choice, Castiel prefers fighting in his true form, with his antlers or his wing spurs. Balthazar likes to fight with his tentacles, because he is inappropriate.\nYES, CASTIEL, chimes in Uriel, whose judgement on such things Castiel trusts much more than Balthazar\u2019s, PERHAPS THE INSIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS ARE WHAT THE WINCHESTER FLEA NEEDS.\n(Uriel is just sore because when he\u2019d aimed at Dean, he\u2019d missed.)\nI DO NOT HAVE A VESSEL, Castiel reminds them. With a flick of his Grace he diverts a car crash that would have resulted in the death of a man who would eventually start an incredibly influential social rights movement.\nCastiel\u2019s last vessel had been several million years ago. He thinks it was a dilophosaurus.\nSO GRAB ONE. Balthazar drops down into his own vessel, though his Grace is still connected to Castiel\u2019s so that they could speak. WE ALL HAVE OUR FAVORITES, AND HUMANKIND IS FILLED WITH THE FAITHFUL BEGGING FOR OUR INTERVENTION.\n\nYOU WOULD NEED A HANDS-ON APPROACH, Anael tells him thoughtfully. YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM, PERHAPS THAT\u2019S WHY ALL OTHER ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED. TRY TO CHOOSE A VESSEL THAT WINCHESTER WOULD BE MOST RECEPTIVE TO.\n\nCastiel takes a moment to observe Dean Winchester\u2019s soul, and gleans from it as much as he can. Then he casts his many eyes across the earthly realm, speeding this way and that, until he alights on a potential vessel that he thinks will best fit his needs.\n------------\n\nJAMES NOVAK I AM CASTIEL-THE-SHIELD-OF-THE-LORD, ANGEL OF HEAVEN, FIRE AND WRATH AND FORGIVENESS, DO YOU HEAR MY VOICE?\n\nJimmy Novak stares unblinkingly at a television screen that jolts from image to image rapidly. The lights flicker on and off and the floorboards shake and groan. He doesn\u2019t move. He can\u2019t.\n\nI hear your voice, Castiel-The-Shield-Of-The-Lord.\n\nAND YOU ARE FAITHFUL TO YOUR LORD AND FATHER AND HEAVEN AND ITS DESIGNS?\nJimmy was raised a good Catholic boy. He knows what the right answer is.\n\nI am faithful to my Lord and Father and Heaven and Its designs.\n\n\nTHEN GRANT ME PASSAGE TO YOUR BODY SO I MAY WALK WITH YOUR LEGS AND SPEAK WITH YOUR TONGUE, TO FULFILL OUR GREAT AND GLORIOUS PURPOSE.\n\n\nYes.\n\nFor the first time in millions of years, Castiel\u2019s lungs expand and he breathes in air.\nHumankind, he decides as he flexes his fingers, is much superior to the dilophosaurus.\n------------\n\nSo what is our great and glorious purpose?\n\n\nTO FACILITATE THE UNION OF DEAN WINCHESTER AND JOANNA HARVELLE THAT THEY MAY BEGET THE DESCENDANTS OF CAIN AND ABEL TO HOST MY BROTHERS FOR THE COMING WAR.\n\n\nWait. We\u2019re matchmaking?\n\n\nESSENTIALLY.\n\n\nYou possessed me so that you could convince two random people to have sex?\n\n\nMARRIAGE WOULD BE IDEAL AS WELL THOUGH I SUPPOSE AS LONG AS TWO SONS ARE BORN OF THEM IT IS NOT REQUIRED.\n\n\nOh my God.\n\n\nI AM NOT GOD, I AM CASTIEL-WHO-IS-THE-SHIELD-OF-THE-LORD. IT IS A WORTHY PURPOSE, JAMES NOVAK, I CAN FEEL YOUR SHAME AND ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS UNFOUNDED.\n\n\nYou motherfucker.\n\n\nI HAVE FUCKED NO MOTHERS.\n\n------------\nSeeing Dean Winchester through mortal eyes is an experience. As an angel, Castiel spends a lot of time looking at souls to determine if they are just and worthy of divine intervention. Dean\u2019s soul, while blemished and tattered and mottled with pain and regret and sadness, still burns brightly, almost spitefully, as if determined to remain righteous despite the darkness in him. Secretly, Castiel has always respected him for this. Truly the best candidate to father The Righteous Man.\nHowever, Dean Winchester also has green eyes and an easy smile and a deep voice, which is something Castiel had known intellectually but is striking in person and on the mortal plane.\n\nHe\u2019s pretty.\n\n\nTHIS FACT IS UNRELATED TO OUR GOALS. ALSO, YOU ARE MARRIED.\n\n\nI can look, I just can\u2019t touch. Not much else to do while you\u2019re in the saddle anyway.\n\nHe appears to help Dean on a hunt. Jo Harvelle is nowhere to be seen; in fact, she is several hundred miles away at the Roadhouse bar. Dean Winchester is alone, save for an exceptionally angry Shishi, and Castiel himself.\nThis is on purpose; while Castiel might not be one for politics, he is a tactician on the battlefield with the ability to plan ahead, and anticipate moves and act accordingly. He thinks that the many failures of his brothers and sisters is due to their abundance of subtlety. They\u2019ve poked and prodded quietly from the shadows for too long, and it is time to step out and spread their wings, so to speak.\nCastiel has always been of the opinion that the straightforward answer is usually the best one.\nThe Shishi charges for Dean, who ducks behind a fallen tree, shouting as the monstrous dog-lion throws all of its weight and bulk into the log. He shoots wildly, but silver bullets do little but annoy the monster. Castiel lands with a flap of feathers, and with a burst of Grace he wills the Shishi to transform into a teacup poodle.\nDean Winchester peeks out from his hiding spot.\nHis brothers and sisters begin to watch, interest piqued. They mutter to each other about how bold Castiel is.\n\u201cDean Winchester,\u201d Castiel says calmly, rolling his borrowed shoulders. \u201cI am Castiel, an Angel of the Lord.\u201d\nDean blinks. \u201cPull the other one.\u201d\nCastiel brings his wings onto the mortal plane to cast their shadows across the forest, feathers rustling. Dean shoots him in the head.\n\nThat\u2019s not going to scar, is it?\n\nCastiel sighs. The angels twitter in amusement.\nThe teacup poodle pees on the tree.\n------------\n\u201cSo you\u2019re an angel?\u201d Dean stares at him, chin propped up on one hand while the other taps against his beer bottle. \u201cYou\u2019re not shitting me?\u201d\nThey are sitting at the bar of one of few drinking establishments Castiel could find that allows pets inside. The drinking establishment happens to be in France. The teacup poodle is settled comfortably in the crook of Castiel\u2019s arm, chewing on Jimmy Novak\u2019s trench coat.\n\u201cI am not defecating, no.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Dean sips at his drink.\nTELL HIM THAT GOD HAS CALLED HIM FOR A HIGHER PURPOSE, Raphael says urgently, eager to get the show on the road.\nIf you tell him that you showed up to make him bang some girl he\u2019s going to freak out, Jimmy points out helpfully. Castiel relays his advice to Raphael. Raphael sputters at being shot down by a possessed human. Balthazar laughs.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s an angel want with me, anyway?\u201d Dean asks. He sounds unconcerned, but Castiel can see in his soul that he is wary and apprehensive. Dean Winchester is not used to good things happening to him, and has likely never witnessed a miracle.\n\u201cYour soul was righteous, and you were in peril,\u201d Castiel says.\n\nTELL HIM TO FORNICATE WITH THE HARVELLE GIRL.\n\n\nZACHARIAH HAVE PATIENCE, HUMANS ARE DELICATE CREATURES.\n\n\nTELL HIM TO FORNICATE WITH HER DELICATES.\n\nCastiel shuts out his bickering siblings.\n\u201cAnd who\u2019re you wearing?\u201d Dean\u2019s hand sneaks into his jacket, where Castiel knows he\u2019s hidden the magic demon knife. He\u2019s faintly amused that Dean would try to stab and kill him in a crowded pet bar in France. A sheep bleats from a corner. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve heard about angels, you guys wouldn\u2019t go around possessing poor bastards.\u201d\nCastiel glances down at himself curiously. He hasn\u2019t really taken the time to familiarize himself with his vessel; he picked James Novak because he was roughly the same age as Dean, give or take a few years, and was unassuming but (Anael had assured him) fairly attractive by human standards. He chose James Novak, because according to Dean\u2019s soul, James Novak was his \u201ctype\u201d.\n\u201cRead the Bible,\u201d Castiel suggests. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be an enlightening experience for you. But no, we cannot possess humans. Angels must ask for permission to enter a vessel. I am currently residing in the body of James Novak, a devout man. He is not dead, merely\u2026 in the backseat, so to speak.\u201d\n\nTell him I said hi.\n\n\u201cHe says hello.\u201d\nDean stares at him like he\u2019s trying to work out a particularly difficult puzzle. Castiel doesn\u2019t understand why, because he\u2019s been rather upfront. \u201cWell heya, Jimbo.\u201d\nTHIS IS GETTING US NOWHERE. Raphael\u2019s irritation and impatience is bearing down on Castiel, threatening to pull him out of his vessel and back to Heaven with the force of his ire. Some other angels agree with him and are pushing to wipe Dean\u2019s memory of Castiel, but others are curious to see how it will turn out. They argue amongst themselves and it gives Castiel a headache.\n\u201cSo, what?\u201d Castiel forces himself to return his attention to Dean. \u201cI say my hail Mary\u2019s and ring my bell and then I\u2019ve got my own pocket angel to fuck shit up if I need help?\u201d\nHE WILL BE MORE OPEN TO INFLUENCE IF HE TRUSTS YOU, Anael says quietly. The rest of the Host pauses their fighting to think about this. BEFRIEND HIM.\nWE SHOULD HAVE SENT SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THIS, Uriel says, disgruntled. CASTIEL IS TOO OBLIVIOUS TO THE HUMAN CULTURE. HE\u2019LL PUT HIS FOOT IN IT. LET ME GO INSTEAD. I CAN BETTER CHARM HIM TO OUR CAUSE.\nCastiel doesn\u2019t feel too insulted because this is largely true.\nBalthazar comes to his defense, snapping, SENDING TOO MANY ANGELS DOWN THERE WILL CONFUSE AND OVERWHELM THE WINCHESTER. CASSIE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE CONTACT.\nBECOME THE FRIEND, CASTIEL, Raphael determines. THEN THE FORNICATION.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Castiel tells Dean with a shrug. \u201cThat about covers it.\u201d\n------------\nMaking friends with Dean is surprisingly easy. Castiel will be the first to admit that his standoffish indifference to humankind and their evolution has led to him being significantly less versed in their culture and traditions than some of his more curious siblings, but all Dean seems to require in a friendship is someone at his back in a fight and someone at his side to celebrate the win afterwards.\nSam Winchester has gone back to California to finish his education, and while Castiel can tell that Dean is proud of his brother, he can also tell that Dean is floundering without the company. So naturally he clings to the nearest source of companionship like a pilot fish, and given his ulterior motives to befriending Dean, Castiel chooses not to make a big deal out of it.\nSo they hunt, Dean never staying in one place for long and Castiel following him placidly, and Dean opens up over the next few months of their burgeoning friendship to tell Castiel things that he already knows.\nMother and father killed by a demon, hunting his entire life, probably never going to settle down, blah blah blah. Castiel can take a quick glance at Dean\u2019s soul and learn all of this, but somehow the fact that Dean has voluntarily supplied the information means something.\nYou did it, Castiel, Jimmy says sarcastically, growing more and more annoyed with how long he\u2019s been riding bitch in his own body. You did the friendship.\nAnd the thing is, he really did. Dean is as much his friend as he is Dean\u2019s, he thinks. At least, they\u2019re friends as angels define friendship; they hunt and they bleed and they kill together and after a long day of battle they clean each other\u2019s wounds and Castiel keeps watch over the world while Dean rests.\nEASY THERE, CASSIE, ELSE YOU\u2019LL MAKE ME JEALOUS, Balthazar warns good-naturedly.\nAt first, his angelic audience didn\u2019t really bother him. Castiel is used to being in constant contact with his family, as angels are not private creatures and it\u2019s easy to use the excuse of all-seeing to justify what basically constitutes as spying. In fact, the brief moments where Castiel is cut off from his siblings, usually in battle when their connection can be more distracting than helpful, often leave him feeling lonely and bereft.\nBut now he feels way too much like he\u2019s living in one of the sitcoms that Dean is fond of, with the heavenly host providing the canned laughter.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that they keep trying to give him critiques and advice.\nYOU\u2019RE MOVING TOO SLOWLY, CASTIEL, Zachariah chastises.\nHE TRUSTS YOU NOW, Rachel says soothingly, BROACH THE TOPIC OF THE HARVELLE GIRL.\nSo, over the course of a month, Castiel gradually leads them back towards Nebraska. After they cross the state line, Dean seems to suddenly think of something.\n\u201cOh, hey. I have friends a couple hours from here.\u201d He turns down the radio, but still taps his fingers against the steering wheel of the Impala. \u201cRemember, I told you about Ellen and Jo?\u201d\nOf course Castiel remembers, he is an all-knowing celestial being who has existed since the very beginning of existence. He has closed his eyes and blinked for longer periods of time than Dean has been alive. If asked, he could name every molecule of every atom of every element on the Periodic Table, and most elements not it it to boot.\n\u201cYes,\u201d is what he says instead. \u201cThey own a bar.\u201d\nDean seems pleased that Castiel listens and retains the information he\u2019s shared, and he shoots him a grin, green eyes bright and teeth showing.\nCastiel experiences something in his lower stomach resembling indigestion.\nJAMES NOVAK, he says, concerned. THERE IS A WORRYING SENSATION IN MY ABDOMEN, BUT I SENSE NO SICKNESS WITHIN THE VESSEL THAT COULD CAUSE IT. I BELIEVE THAT YOUR BODY MAY BE BROKEN. MY CONDOLENCES.\nYou\u2019re a fucking moron, is all Jimmy says in response, and then sullenly grows quiet.\n\u201cWe should visit them after this hunt,\u201d Dean says. It\u2019s a suggestion, but a hopeful one. Castiel knows that Dean will drive on past the Roadhouse without stopping if he even hints that he doesn\u2019t want to meet the Harvelles. Thankfully, meeting the Harvelles is an essential part of Heaven\u2019s plan.\nIF YOU DON\u2019T GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD I\u2019M HALF AFRAID THAT RAPHAEL WILL CHEW HIS OWN FEATHERS OFF, Balthazar mumbles, his voice soft enough that Castiel is the only one to hear it. Angels rarely speak directly to each other without shouting into the entire Host, but it\u2019s been several months since Castiel has descended from Heaven to talk to Dean. When he cautiously pulls at the empathic connection between himself and his siblings, he can feel that there is a nervous buzz.\nHe\u2019s made progress on their mission, but not enough, and now he\u2019s stalled.\n\u201cI would like to meet them,\u201d he answers Dean finally. Thankfully, Dean is used to his awkward silences while he convenes with his family.\nAnael, who is the most helpful with her advice regarding human relationships, pipes up, BRING UP THE GIRL, MAKE HIM THINK OF HER! So Castiel continues, \u201cEspecially Jo, I am most curious about her.\u201d\nDean smirks and taps his fingers a bit harder. \u201cHeh, yeah. Jo\u2019s a firecracker alright.\u201d\nCOMPLIMENT HER APPEARANCE! Anael urges. Castiel frowns minutely.\n\nI\u2019VE NO IDEA HOW TO COMPLIMENT A HUMAN. THEY DON\u2019T HAVE WINGS OR PRONGS AND THEY\u2019VE ONLY GOT ONE HEAD, THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.\n\nHER EYES! Inias suggests. TALK ABOUT HER EYES!\n\nNO, FOOL, WINCHESTER WON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THOSE. THEY ONLY HAVE TWO. WHAT DO HUMANS FIND ATTRACTIVE? TOES? THEY HAVE A LOT OF TOES. COMPOSE A POEM ABOUT HER TOES!\n\nQUALITY OVER QUANTITY, BALTHAZAR, DEAR, Aziraphale scolds gently.\nDISCUSS HER BLOODTHIRST AND HER KNIFE COLLECTION, roars Virgil, who Castiel thinks is developing something of a crush on Jo himself.\nHe\u2019s slept with her, right? Jimmy hums thoughtfully. Talk about her boobs. That\u2019ll get him going.\nCastiel\u2019s headache is getting significantly worse.\n\u201cHey, Cas. You okay?\u201d\nHe blinks, shoving the mental argument aside for the moment. Dean is staring at him with something resembling concern, eyebrows pulled inwards in worry. Castiel nods shortly in answer to his question. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dean. My siblings are\u2026 rowdy.\u201d\nDean\u2019s lips thin out and he stares back out the windshield to the long stretch of road in front of them. \u201cThey sound like dicks, dude,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cLike two or three times a day I turn to see you sittin\u2019 there looking constipated.\u201d He slams on the gas pedal to pass a sedan that\u2019s now honking its horn at them, then flips the driver the bird out the window. \u201cThey yell at you that much?\u201d\nCastiel shrugs. \u201cAt me, at each other, at themselves, at humanity. There are a lot of us, and we all have something to say, so there\u2019s generally a lot of shouting.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys ever tried whispering?\u201d\nCastiel frowns and looks out his own window. \u201cThe only one who whispers is Lucifer, who is the Fallen One and the Prince of Darkness and the Morning Star. Sometimes, every few centuries, when he grows strong or we grow weak, we can hear him murmuring to us from the Pit, and he burns at us with frigid fire and temptation.\u201d\nDean has fallen silent in shock, and the Host has as well, a sort of quiet discomfort that talking about their lost brother often brings. Despite himself, and his own private sadness over Lucifer\u2019s falling, Castiel finds the silence damn near peaceful.\nBut he is on a mission, and so he finally continues, \u201cBut yes, I am looking forward to meeting Jo. I\u2019m sure she has nice breasts.\u201d\nDean turns to stare at him so fast that Castiel is sure he\u2019ll need to be curing whiplash soon, and Jimmy crows through his laughter I wasn\u2019t being serious!\nCastiel believes that he is developing a migraine.\n------------\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the angel guy?\u201d asks Jo Harvelle in amusement as she wipes the bar clean with a rag.\nDean is somewhere near the jukebox, trying to decide between one hair band whose lyrics have heavy religious subtones and another, leaving Castiel sitting alone on a barstool. This is the first opportunity that Castiel has had to speak to Jo alone, as every hunter in the midwest seems to be passing through the Roadhouse today, and they\u2019re all eager to meet Dean Winchester\u2019s fabled pet angel, poking him with silver and splashing him with holy water.\nThey\u2019ve even made him fly just to prove that he can; he flaps his wings and lands in Honolulu, grabs a lei and a margarita in a coconut, and flies back to the Roadhouse with them. A hunter named Walt gets the lei, and another named Roy gets the margarita. Ellen Harvelle threatens to kick them out for bringing in outside alcohol, so Castiel flies to Israel and then presents her with a jug of holy oil, which he feels she will appreciate far more than a lei.\n(Wow, you\u2019re like a carrier pigeon mixed with an eager-to-please puppy, Jimmy tells him.\nCastiel is lucky that dealing with his siblings has seen fit to afford him with near-endless patience regarding small-minded creatures and their silly habits.)\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answers. \u201cI am the angel guy.\u201d\n\u201cCool,\u201d Jo says with a smile, but it\u2019s a bit hard to see around all of the celestial arrows that are sticking out of her face and chest. Dean\u2019s are still there as well of course, but Castiel has learned enough of his mortal body through observation that he can see Dean without the arrows in the way. If he spends enough time with Jo he\u2019ll be able to ignore hers too, but right now the arrow sticking out of her eyeball is disconcerting. \u201cDean\u2019s told me about you.\u201d\nCastiel nods. He is a new and exciting development in Dean\u2019s life, and his existence is a discovery for hunters everywhere. It\u2019s only natural that Dean has discussed him. In fact, Castiel would be disappointed if his charge was so foolish as to keep information about the angels to himself.\n\u201cAnd he has about you to me, as well.\u201d\nShe winks at him. \u201cAll good things, I hope.\u201d\nTHIS IS GOOD, VERY GOOD, Zachariah says excitedly. Castiel barely refrains from startling. For a moment, he\u2019d forgotten that he has a perpetual audience. INQUIRE AS TO HER MARITAL STATUS.\nBefore Castiel can open his mouth, Anael quickly adds, BUT BE SUBTLE! ASK IF SHE\u2019S SEEING ANYONE CURRENTLY.\nWith his siblings coaching him, Castiel manages to ask somewhat casually, \u201cSo, in regards to your relationship status, is there anyone that you have your sights on?\u201d\nJo\u2019s eyebrows shoot up and she sends a fleeting glance to Dean, who\u2019s been engaged in conversation with another hunter. His eyes slide over to their place at the bar and he lifts his head in acknowledgement, a slight smile playing at his lips. Castiel\u2019s about to tip his own head in answer, but Zachariah nearly shrieks SHE MADE EYE-CONTACT WITH THE WINCHESTER AFTER YOU ASKED THE QUESTION!\nSHE WISHES TO ENGAGE IN FORNICATION! Raphael booms triumphantly, but Aziraphale says tiredly, THEY\u2019VE ALREADY DONE THAT, DEAR. LOVE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\nWE\u2019VE GOT A FOOT IN THE DOOR ANYWAY, Balthazar placates them, and several dozen other angels feel the need to give their input as well. Castiel reaches over to Dean\u2019s beer, which is still sitting at his empty stool, and takes a hearty gulp.\nIt doesn\u2019t do much to settle his nerves, but it always seems to calm Dean, and perhaps that will carry over as a placebo to Castiel.\nJo, who\u2019s not as used to Castiel\u2019s thousand yard stare as Dean is, now looks faintly concerned and even somewhat wary. \u201cUm, no,\u201d she answers shortly. \u201cNot really. Why?\u201d\nPLAY IT SAFE, Rachel hisses.\nCastiel shrugs, staring down at his pilfered drink and trying to ignore the cacophony of voices rattling around in his head. In his true form he\u2019s better able to filter them out, to remain aware without paying attention, but trapped as he is in his vessel the bickering and arguing and snipping of his family is like a handful of jackhammers drilling away at his skull. \u201cNo reason. Just, you know\u2026\u201d He gestures vaguely. \u201cDean.\u201d\nJo\u2019s eyes narrow at him and he meets her gaze languidly. After a few seconds she seems to relax, a tiny smile flitting across her mouth. \u201cYeah. Dean.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut no, he and I aren\u2019t together. Maybe once, but\u2026\u201d She looks him up and down, then glances back over to Dean. \u201cNot anymore, I think.\u201d\nThe whole Host immediately wails disparagingly. I DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND, Raphael whines, THEY WERE THE PERFECT MATCH. WHAT HAPPENED.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good guy, though,\u201d she continues on hurriedly. \u201cI still care about him, you know, one of my best friends. But,\u201d Jo\u2019s voice drops and she stares into Castiel\u2019s eyes meaningfully, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about me liking him.\u201d\nCastiel tries not to let his disappointment show on his face.\nDean slides onto the stool beside him, swiping his drink back with a cheeky grin. \u201cYou guys talkin\u2019 about me?\u201d he asks before taking a long sip.\n\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you, jackass,\u201d Jo snaps, but her voice is playful, and she whips her towel at him.\nLOOK, Samandriel says easily, ever the optimist. COMRADERY. WITH CLOSE FRIENDSHIP, LOVE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION. WE AREN\u2019T DOOMED YET. This rouses another chorus of bickering and shouting.\nDean laughs and glances over at Castiel, who responds with a small, barely-there smile of his own, eyes softening at the prospect that his mission is not a complete failure. To have gotten so far, farther than any of his siblings, and fall short now would be terrible. Dean grins even wider and goes back to cheerfully bantering with Jo.\nFucking morons, the whole lot of you, Jimmy grumbles.\n------------\nCastiel likes to watch documentaries when they stop at motels, because it annoys Dean and Jimmy both when he constantly corrects the laughable mistakes and points out the incredible inaccuracies.\n\u201cZebras aren\u2019t black and white to confuse their predators,\u201d he says conversationally. \u201cMy brother, Gazardiel, designed them to have iridescent colors of the rainbow. But he got in a feud with our sister Anpiel, the patron angel of birds, and she stole the zebra\u2019s colors and dyed the bird\u2019s feathers with them.\u201d\n(In Heaven, Gazardiel sends Anpiel a nasty look that she merely giggles at.)\n\u201cWait,\u201d Dean says, rolling over to face Castiel on his bed. \u201cI thought God created all of the animals?\u201d Castiel shrugs.\n\u201cHe supplied the power, we supplied the creativity. This was before you humans came along, when we were still His favored children.\u201d He hums thoughtfully and watches as several lions team up to take down a zebra. \u201cWe were much more carefree then, and so too were the animals. Then Lucifer Fell, and we became warriors.\u201d\nDean puts his chin in both of his hands, ignoring the television in favor of paying attention to Castiel. This is one of their quiet moments where nothing exceptionally exciting is happening, which Castiel is grateful for because it means that his siblings are uninterested and he doesn\u2019t have to deal with them chiming in all the time.\nThe Choirs are all paying attention to their own duties; the Seraphs and Cherubs are in battle, the Virtues tend to their Gardens, and the Hashmallim deal with the bureaucracy. Only a few angels are watching them at the moment, perhaps a hundred or so. Castiel has a feeling that his brothers and sisters are starting to view Dean and himself as a source of entertainment.\nHe\u2019s gone from feeling like a character on a sitcom to a fish in a bowl.\n\u201cSo did you make any animals?\u201d Dean asks curiously. \u201cWhich ones?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t really create animals. We just inspired them to exist in a way we found pleasing, and evolution did the rest.\u201d A commercial comes on and Castiel changes the channel with a flick of his finger. Dean glances at the remote, which is on his bed and several feet away from where Castiel is sitting, and grins. He thinks it\u2019s hilarious when Castiel uses his Grace to do ordinary human things. This is probably why Castiel does it so often.\n\u201cTomato, tomahto,\u201d Dean tells him, flopping sideways onto his pillow, still smiling.\n\u201cI personally never cared much for the process; I appreciated the concept, but I never really had the patience for it. I modeled the elk after my left head, the golden eagle after my right, and the jackal after my middle and then called it quits.\u201d\nDean stares at him. \u201cYou have three heads?\u201d he asks blankly. Castiel nods.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not exactly the same, of course, but those three animals were the closest approximations I could conceive. Balthazar was much more enthusiastic, and there are a slew of animals running around that can credit themselves to him. The bearded vulture, for instance, and many birds of paradise. Also some fish. He has a penchant for anything that\u2019s colorful.\u201d\nBalthazar, who is always paying attention, even if it\u2019s only very slightly, preens. YOU SHOULD TELL HIM ABOUT THE PEAFOWL.\n\u201cYeah, okay. But three heads.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then Gabriel got it into his head that he wanted to create something, and that\u2019s how Australia happened. None of us were really sure why our Father gave him the okay on that one, but the Lord does work in mysterious ways.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else do you have three of?\u201d\nCastiel lets out a very slight smile. In Heaven, some of the angels watching him exchange knowing glances, but he tunes them out in favor of Dean, who is here with him and infinitely more interesting.\n------------\nThey poke around the midwest for a few more weeks, but there isn\u2019t much in the way of work that hasn\u2019t already been taken care of by other hunters. The Roadhouse acts as a sort of hub, Ellen and Ash sending people out across the country from there to handle the supernatural. A few times Dean offers their services to other hunters and once or twice they fall into a group to take out large nests, but hunters are mostly solitary predators and angels fight best when alone where they have enough room to spread their wings, or occasionally with a close partner.\nEvery now and then someone will attempt to convince Castiel to leave Dean to travel with other hunters, and while Dean merely shrugs and says it\u2019s his decision, Castiel never takes them up on any of their offers. He\u2019s grown used to the way Dean fights, how he reacts to stimulus and what decisions he will make, and Castiel can act accordingly. Besides, his true purpose is to get Dean and Jo together, which he can\u2019t do if he\u2019s travelling with other hunters.\nEven though Dean never really fights to keep Castiel close, he always seems somewhat smug when he chooses to stay.\nEven beyond his duty, though, Castiel is growing\u2026 attached to Dean. He keeps those emotions hidden away from his siblings for fear of how they\u2019d react. Even Balthazar is ignorant to the fact that Castiel is becoming anxious over the fact that his goals will eventually lead to him no longer seeing Dean.\nOf course, even after Dean and Jo conceive the vessels of Michael and Lucifer, Castiel will still be able to visit. Just not as often. Or for as long. And not just for Dean. (He will probably not visit.)\nThe only one privy to his growing insecurities is Jimmy. The nature of the angel-vessel bonding sort of meshes their thoughts in a way that even his connection to his siblings can\u2019t; Jimmy can draw away and put distance between them, but nothing is ever really hidden.\nJimmy regards his feelings first with disdain, then with amusement, then with sympathy.\nBut no matter that Castiel will regret the loss of Dean\u2019s companionship. He has a mission and a purpose and it\u2019s incredibly important, and he will see it through.\n------------\nCastiel gets trapped in a ring of holy fire in Minnesota.\nThey\u2019ve been tracking demonic omens for the last week and Castiel had just caught the scent of the demons responsible, but when he flew in pursuit after them he\u2019d landed in a circle of unlit holy oil, which promptly became a circle of incredibly lit holy fire.\nDemons, he thinks wearily, have gotten much smarter in the last few centuries.\nHe\u2019s not all that worried, though. While he can\u2019t spread his wings too far without fear of scorching them, likewise the demon guarding him can\u2019t hurt him unless it crosses over to his side of the ring. Besides, Dean knows the warehouse Castiel had chased his query to and is no doubt raising hell to get there.\nCastiel wonders what the appeal is to warehouses. Because it\u2019s always, always warehouses.\nInside the holy fire he\u2019s cut off from Heaven, and the absolute and complete silence is deafening. Even when his siblings are quiet, Castiel can always feel them pressing against his consciousness. But now he is well and truly alone.\nWell, except for the demon.\n\nWhat am I, chopped liver?\n\nAnd Jimmy.\n\nCan this guy kill us?\n\n\nNO. HE DOESN\u2019T HAVE AN ANGEL BLADE. TORTURE AND SEVERELY MAIM FOR INFORMATION ON HEAVEN? YES. KILL? NO.\n\n\nOh. Well at least there\u2019s a bright side.\n\n\nIF THAT COMES TO THAT I WILL TAKE THE BRUNT OF THE SENSATION. YOUR SOUL WILL REMAIN LARGELY UNSCATHED.\n\n\nIs that healthy for you?\n\n\nNOT PARTICULARLY.\n\n\nHopefully Dean will get here before that. I wonder where he is?\n\nOutside of the room Castiel is trapped in, a scream breaks through the air, and then dies just as quickly. The demon guarding Castiel jerks in surprise, black eyes reflecting the fire as it swivels towards the door.\n\nJUST THERE, IT WOULD SEEM.\n\nThe door bursts open and Dean charges in, a veritable freight train of rage and plaid. His knife slashes through the air but the demon ripostes, twisting at the last second to avoid Dean\u2019s blade and strike out with his own weapon, a jagged ugly piece of metal.\nThe two dance around each other for a few tense moments and Castiel wonders why Dean\u2019s so out of form when suddenly Dean\u2019s right leg, bloody at the knee, buckles under his weight. It sends him tilting to the side and when the demon catches sight of the injury it kicks him square in the knee, face twisted with contempt.\n\u201cDean!\u201d Castiel shouts helplessly, a pure and unbridled fear shooting down his spine. Dean crashes to the ground with a grunt, then gasps as the demon\u2019s makeshift blade sinks into his side.\nCastiel screams.\nThere is a bright flash of light and the entire building rumbles threateningly. The demon blinks out of existence from an abrupt force of pure Heavenly Grace. Castiel stares numbly as the ceiling begins to collapse, because that Grace wasn\u2019t his own.\nA piece of debris falls in front of him, across the holy fire and breaking the circle. Immediately the Host begins to chatter in his mind, surprised and panicked, but he isn\u2019t paying attention. Castiel leaps towards Dean, then spreads his wings and flies.\nOutside, he ignores the groaning, creaking wreckage of the warehouse in favor of running his hands, charged with his Grace, over the bloody mess of Dean\u2019s side. It sings over his skin, knitting the broken flesh back together easily, and within seconds Dean\u2019s ragged breathing is calm and even again.\nCastiel breathes a sigh of relief when Dean\u2019s eyes open again. Then he looks up.\n\u201cFancy meeting you here, stranger,\u201d Balthazar smiles easily, standing in his vessel a few feet away. Castiel feels even more relief, and after checking one more to make sure that Dean is okay he climbs to his feet and embraces him.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d he greets, an answering smile tugging his lips. \u201cYou knew where to find me?\u201d\nBalthazar shrugs his vessel\u2019s shoulders in a way that seems far more casual than Castiel could ever hope to achieve. Unlike himself, Balthazar has always had an easy time with the navigation of wearing a vessel. \u201cWe knew the general area of where you\u2019d been cut off from us, and when you screamed we heard it even through the fire.\u201d He claps Castiel\u2019s arm, grinning. \u201cSaved your arse, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\nHE WAS JUST THE FASTEST ONE OF US, Anael assures Castiel, and he\u2019s nearly overwhelmed by the rush of relief and happiness that she sends him. The sentiment is echoed by Rachel and Inias and many more of his siblings, and even Uriel is pleased that he escaped unharmed.\nYOU ALMOST LET WINCHESTER DIE, Raphael snaps. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM, CASTIEL.\nCastiel frowns.\nIGNORE HIM, Hester says gently. WE\u2019RE WATCHING OVER YOU CLOSELY NOW, BROTHER. WE WON\u2019T LET THEM CATCH YOUR WINGS AGAIN.\nCastiel sends them all a wave of gratitude and gratefulness, but he can\u2019t help but feel like he deserves Raphael\u2019s ire. Dean is his responsibility.\nSpeaking of which, Dean is now on his feet and watching them warily, eyes darting from Castiel to Balthazar as if he\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s supposed to react.\n\u201cDean,\u201d Castiel says, \u201cthis is my brother, Balthazar. He broke the circle of holy fire and allowed me to escape.\u201d Dean relaxes, his shoulders losing some of their tension and his eyes becoming less cautious and more curious.\n\u201cCharmed, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Balthazar simpers. Dean frowns again.\n\u201cMan,\u201d he grumbles, \u201cyour family really is full of dicks.\u201d\n\u201cBalthazar saved us,\u201d Castiel reminds him. There\u2019s a cut on Dean\u2019s head, one that he missed before because it wasn\u2019t bleeding heavily, and he reaches out with a hand to heal it. Dean makes an annoyed sound, but lets Castiel touch him gently and he closes his eyes against the glow of Grace.\nBalthazar watches them with a secretive grin, arms crossed, and when Castiel meets his eyes again they\u2019re annoyingly smug. Despite his gratitude it rankles him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks gruffly, feathers twitching in enough agitation that Balthazar can surely feel it.\nHis brother just grins wider, head tilted. \u201cNothing, Cassie,\u201d he purrs. \u201cJust\u2026 on my way to winning a bet, I think.\u201d\nBalthazar flaps his wings and vanishes, leaving Castiel annoyed and Dean looking around in surprise.\n\u201cCas?\u201d Dean asks, touching his arm nervously. Castiel huffs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, they\u2019re all dicks.\u201d\nIn Heaven, Balthazar laughs.\n------------\nIt takes a while for things to come to a head. Despite several trips to the Roadhouse, and despite his attempts at gently pushing Dean and Jo together, Castiel has officially hit a plateau on his mission.\nDean and Jo laugh and flirt and slap at each other like children, and there is obviously a great amount of affection between the two of them, but for whatever reason they just refuse to fall in love. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating, and also incredibly painful.\nBecause Castiel is beginning to recognize that his own feelings of affection for Dean go beyond simple friendship. And this is very much not a good thing; not for the mission, and not for Castiel himself.\nNearly a year after alighting on Earth and taking a vessel, they\u2019re joined by Bobby Singer for a hunt in North Dakota, and afterwards he and Dean make the trip back to the Roadhouse with the old man in tow. Bobby immediately gets into an argument with Ellen, shouting and screaming and throwing things.\nDean and Jo, obviously used to this behavior, watch from the sidelines with their beers, unimpressed. Castiel, who has developed a fondness for the sweet-flavored drinks called appletinis, sips at his delicately. If you stick your pinky out it makes you fancy, Jimmy tells him. Jimmy is ignored.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be married before you know it,\u201d Jo says slyly. Dean clinks their beer bottles together.\nCastiel looks between the two of them, disbelieving. \u201cWhat? They can\u2019t stand each other. Look, Ellen just punched him in the face. That is not love.\u201d\n\u201cThere are different kinds of love, Cas,\u201d Dean tells him, nudging his arm with an elbow. Castiel snorts into his appletini. \u201cTheirs is just the violent, disrespectful kind. But if you liquored them up they\u2019d be going at it like rabbits.\u201d\nJo hits his arm. \u201cDude, gross!\u201d she says, frowning, but the wheels in Castiel\u2019s head are turning.\n\u201cJo punched you in the face when you first met,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cDoes that mean you two are in love?\u201d\nBoth the humans stare at him in shock. \u201cH...how did you know that?\u201d Dean asks, voice worryingly low. Castiel blinks at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m an angel, I know everything.\u201d\nFor once, the angels are quiet, but Castiel can feel them watching the conversation avidly, eager for an answer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in love, Cas,\u201d Dean snaps, his tone growing darker. \u201cWhy do you keep hedging at that? Every few days you ask about it like something is gonna change. What do you care?\u201d\nCastiel has no clue how the conversation has gone so sour. He looks from Dean to Jo for some sort of hint, but she\u2019s just watching them with a sort of sad look in her eye. Even Jimmy has gone silent, and for once Castiel wishes he had some advice to share, even if it was insincere.\nHe stammers uncomfortably before trying, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t?\u201d\nObviously that was the wrong thing to say. Dean slams his beer on the counter, grabs his jacket, and storms out of the bar. Even Ellen and Bobby, who\u2019s bleeding heavily from his nose, pause their snarling to watch in bemusement. Outside, the Impala rumbles to life and then thunders out of the parking lot and down the road.\nThe angels begin to twitter nervously. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? Balthazar asks.\nI DON\u2019T KNOW, Castiel responds numbly. AT LEAST I\u2019M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO\u2019S CONFUSED.\nCastiel repeats Balthazar\u2019s question to Jo, who just shakes her head sadly.\n\u201cCas,\u201d she starts, then closes her mouth. \u201cYou know that I like you, right? We\u2019re friends?\u201d He says nothing, because he\u2019s pretty sure Dean is his only human friend and he doesn\u2019t want to offend her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know. Interested in you. Like that.\u201d\nOh my god, Jimmy finally says, while Zachariah roars, CASTIEL WHAT DID YOU DO?\nHe blusters. I DIDN\u2019T DO ANYTHING?\nJo continues, unaware of his confusion, \u201cI know you keep asking about me and Dean because you don\u2019t want to come between us, but I don\u2019t really have any feelings for you at all.\u201d She reaches out and pats his hand, almost upsetting his appletini. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she finishes, sincerely apologetic.\n\u2026.WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON, Raphael says finally. Castiel is in full agreement.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Castiel says dumbly, at a loss for words. For once none of his siblings have any input. They\u2019re all just as fucking confused as he is. \u201cNot you. Dean?\u201d\nJo stares at him in incomprehension, then her face clears and she even smiles. \u201cOh. You\u2026 you like Dean?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d he says, far too loudly and far too quickly. Now Bobby and Ellen are looking at them in suspicion. \u201cNo, not me! You! Dean-you!\u201d\nJo\u2019s not smiling anymore. Now she\u2019s just looking at him like he\u2019s stupid.\nHuman emotions have finally broken you, Jimmy sighs.\nCastiel clears his throat and tries to put his words in order. \u201cI don\u2019t like you. Dean likes you. You like Dean. You and Dean. Together.\u201d\nJo frowns and shakes her head. \u201cCas, no. No, I don\u2019t like Dean like that. He\u2019s like my brother. He\u2026\u201d She exhales sends him a hard look. \u201cMaybe you should talk to him yourself.\u201d\nCastiel stares at her, then lowers his head. With a quick flex of his Grace, he does what he probably should have done months ago at their first meeting: he slides into the metaphysical, unseen, and readies his bow.\nInto his arrow he pours everything that Jo Loves; the rasp of a knife on a whetstone, the taste of hops and grain, an old leather jacket worn soft with age that still vaguely smells of William Harvelle, the gentle arms of her mother and a soft lullaby at night. Since Dean is not here in this room, Castiel must add something extra, something to tie her to him.\nBut he doesn\u2019t add what he knows about Dean. He adds what Dean has told him, because he knows that whispered secrets and memories are far more powerful than knowledge gained without permission.\nAlongside Jo\u2019s love, he mixes in what Love Dean has shared with him; the memory of teaching Sam to walk, of their father cutting their hair in a motel bathroom with sewing scissors to save money, the sun-warm metal of the Impala beneath his bare skin on a hot Kansas day, of tucking back against Castiel himself in the middle of battle and the elation of having someone you trust watch over you.\nThe amount of emotion that Castiel pours into his arrow leaves him drained, leaves the Host awed and breathless, for no putto in existence has ever given so much of themselves to ensure a union.\nCastiel draws his bow and fires.\nIt hits Jo Harvelle straight in the chest.\nShe blinks.\nIt doesn\u2019t absorb.\nThere is complete and utter silence from his brothers and sisters. And then, finally:\nI THINK, Aziraphale murmurs, THAT WE SHOULD GIVE UP ON THIS PARTICULAR VENTURE.\n------------\nCastiel flaps his wings and chases after Dean. He doesn\u2019t have to go far; his charge is parked on an empty stretch of the highway maybe ten miles down the road. Dean is leaning against the Impala, arms crossed and head down, and Castiel lands with a rustle of feathers loud enough to signal his presence. Dean doesn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cYou should be with Jo Harvelle,\u201d Castiel says firmly. Dean tilts his neck to look at him out of the corner of his eye, silent. \u201cIt\u2019s your destiny.\u201d Dean scoffs, but he continues anyway.\n\u201cIt always had to be the two of you, Dean. You\u2019re to be married and have two sons to carry the line of Cain and Abel. When your youngest son is six months old, a demon named Azazel will enter his nursery and bleed into his mouth and he will become the vessel of Lucifer. Your eldest will be the vessel of Michael, and the two of them will unleash Armageddon. As it was written, so shall it be.\u201d\nHe keeps expecting to be interrupted by his siblings. Raphael is no doubt furious that Heaven\u2019s plans are being shared, and Zachariah is probably salivating at the opportunity to rip Castiel a new one. But no angels come to take him, though Castiel can feel every single one of the malakhim watching intently.\nMaybe they want to see how it ends.\n\u201c...are you allowed to tell me this?\u201d Dean asks finally, glaring down at his boots.\nCastiel shakes his head. \u201cI will have to wipe your memory so that you have no knowledge of this conversation. And, most likely, I will be severely punished when I return to Heaven.\u201d\nAt that Dean looks up fully, the entire force of those green eyes boring into Castiel. Dean is simply a human, but even as a Seraph Castiel feels intimidated.\n\u201cFuck destiny,\u201d Dean says, full of conviction. \u201cI don\u2019t care about destiny. Jo is one of my best friends, but I don\u2019t want her.\u201d\nCastiel huffs and he feels his face tighten in frustration. \u201cDean--\u201d\nDean steps forwards, determined, and puts a hand on Castiel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want her,\u201d he repeats, slowly.\nCastiel\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says weakly.\nOH, Balthazar breathes.\nOH, Raphael growls.\nOH, Anael whimpers.\n\nOh my god I fucking knew it.\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t,\u201d Castiel starts. Dean opens his mouth to say something else, but Castiel panics and flaps his wings hard, carrying him far, far away. He finally lands at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, hidden away at the very bottom of the world with nothing but silence weighing him down. His vessel is having trouble handling the pressure, so he slides into his true form, wings spreading across the deep, Jimmy\u2019s body tucked safely between his ribs. His feathers shiver with his stress.\nHis siblings keep chattering in varying amounts of surprise and anger, and some even with acceptance and excitement, but he doesn\u2019t listen, he can\u2019t, because Dean Winchester wants him.\nThen, a voice that he hasn\u2019t heard in millennia cuts through his concentration, surprising him and all of his brethren.\nHA HA HA, the archangel Gabriel laughs in delight. YOU GUYS ARE FUCKED.\n------------\n\nYou\u2019re moping.\n\n\nI AM NOT.\n\n\nCas, we\u2019ve been down here for three weeks. Do you even know how bored I am?\n\n\nTHERE ARE MANY INTERESTING CREATURES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.\n\n\nGlowy specks don\u2019t count.\n\n\nJUST BECAUSE YOU CAN\u2019T SEE THE INTERESTING CREATURES DOESN\u2019T MEAN THEY\u2019RE NOT THERE.\n\n\nStop moping and go talk to Dean.\n\n\nI\u2019M NOT MOPING, I\u2019M PLANNING A STRATEGY. ALSO, NO.\n\n\nGo talk to Dean.\n\n\nNO. I DON\u2019T WANT TO.\n\n\nBut you need to.\n\n\nNO I DON\u2019T. THE MISSION IS A FAILURE. OBVIOUSLY WINCHESTER AND HARVELLE ARE NOT GOING TO CONCEIVE THE CHILDREN NECESSARY. WE\u2019LL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OTHER VESSELS.\n\n\nThe mission doesn\u2019t matter, you need to talk to him.\n\n\nJAMES NOVAK THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.\n\nI\u2019m tired, Castiel. Make this right. I want to go home.\n\n...I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT TO DO.\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n\nI DON\u2019T KNOW! I AM A SERAPH, A WARRIOR AND A TACTICIAN, NOT ONE OF THE PRINCIPALITIES THAT REGULARLY DEAL WITH THESE\u2026 HUMAN THINGS. EMOTIONS, AS YOU SAY, SUCK.\n\n\nSo wing it.\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT HUMOROUS.\n\n\nThat was punny and you know it.\n\n\nNO IT WASN\u2019T.\n\n\nDean would have laughed.\n\n\nDEAN OBVIOUSLY HAS ISSUES WITH POOR JUDGEMENT.\n\n\nLook, I\u2019m not gonna lie and say that I\u2019m totally pleased with the way this whole thing has turned out. When you asked to possess me and I said yes, I was expecting to go into battle, not have this twenty-something twink coming after the angel wearing my ass.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S A TWINK? IS THAT A TYPE OF WARRIOR?\n\n\n\u2026..yes, Castiel. That\u2019s exactly what a twink is. Anyway, what I\u2019m saying is that I think you need to see this through. Can you honestly tell me that if you went back to Heaven right now, you wouldn\u2019t regret it?\n\n\nNO.\n\n\nThen go talk to him, Cas. For all of our sakes.\n\n------------\nCastiel lands in Palo Alto.\nThis is where Dean is, but it\u2019s definitely not Dean who falls off of the couch in shock when he arrives. This person is much smaller, and blonder, and more female. He looks over her soul and comes up with Jessica Moore, nurse, engaged to Sam Winchester.\nWhoa, hey there pretty lady, Jimmy says in appreciation. Castiel sends him a lash of irritated Grace.\nMARRIED, he reminds Jimmy.\n\nAnd you\u2019re about to use my body to mack on Dean, so who\u2019s really in the wrong here?\n\nTHERE WILL BE NO MACKING, Zachariah interrupts forcefully. Jimmy, who isn\u2019t used to being spoken to by an angel who isn\u2019t Castiel (or Balthazar, worryingly enough) falls silent.\n\u201cJessica Moore,\u201d he greets her. She\u2019s still on the floor staring at him in surprise. It\u2019s so discomfiting that he has to take a moment to make sure that his three heads are still carefully tucked away, but no, it\u2019s still just Jimmy\u2019s body. \u201cI\u2019m Castiel, Angel of the Lord.\u201d\nShe gapes at him, mouth opening and closing like a fish. Castiel fidgets uncomfortably before trying helpfully, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Dean Winchester?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were real,\u201d she breathes, shaking her head lightly. \u201cHe just showed up and started drinking and I thought he was crazy, but you just appeared.\u201d She gestures at him and he looks down at his vessel. Yes, his pants are still on, nothing is unzipped, the trench coat is firmly in place, so why is she staring at him like that? \u201cLike teleportation.\"\n\u201cI flew,\u201d he corrects.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she giggles, a little hysterically. \u201cYou flew.\u201d\nA door opens to the side of them and a tall man steps in, eyebrows furrowing in confusion. Sam Winchester, law school, engaged to Jessica Moore.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he says, clutching at a machete. Cas tilts his head in disappointment, as this is also not Dean.\nBefore he can introduce himself again, Jessica says cheerfully, \u201cThis is Castiel, Angel of the Lord.\u201d She throws her hands up into the air with the manner of someone who no longer gives a fuck. \u201cDuh!\u201d\n\nWHERE IS THE DEAN BOY, THESE TWO ARE BORING.\n\n\nPATIENCE, THELIEL, PATIENCE.\n\nSam lowers his machete. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t actually think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNeither did I!\u201d Jessica continues, voice growing higher. \u201cGhosts I can see happening, vampires I can kind of handle. Hell, even demons I\u2019ll accept. But angels?!\u201d She points at Castiel in accusation and he holds up his hands defensively. As seems to be the trend lately, he can feel his control over the situation rapidly deteriorating.\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know about them until recently either!\u201d Sam tosses the machete on the couch. (\u201cWhat have I told you about weapons on the furniture!\u201d Jessica admonishes.)\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Dean,\u201d he reminds them.\nSam puts his hands in his pockets and looks at Castiel assessingly. \u201cSo you\u2019re Dean\u2019s fake angel boyfriend?\u201d he asks, then corrects himself with, \u201cWell, obviously not fake, since here you are.\u201d\nCastiel considers that. He has primarily masculine qualities and his vessel is male, so he feels sufficiently comfortable with using male pronouns, and he\u2019s definitely Dean\u2019s friend. Or at least, he hopes he still is. So he nods at Sam, saying, \u201cThat is correct, yes.\u201d\nOr at least he tries, because he gets halfway through the word correct before Sam pulls out a gun and shoots him in the chest.\n\nPlease tell them to stop doing that!\n\nHe glances down at his vessel, which is bleeding sluggishly, with a raised eyebrow. When he looks back up he gets splashed in the face with holy water. Virgil laughs viciously.\n\nA HIDDEN WEAPON! I LIKE THIS BOY!\n\nCastiel spits out water.\nSam and Jessica are staring at him in horror. Within a few seconds, Dean bursts through the door Sam just came through, pistol drawn. \u201cSammy!\u201d he barks, but stops short when he sees Castiel, who lifts one hand and waves weakly in greeting.\n\u201cHello Dean,\u201d he mumbles. Dean drops his gun to his side and sighs.\n\u201cHey, Cas.\u201d He turns to Jess and Sam, who are huddled together on the couch. \u201cCan you guys excuse us for a second? Feathers and I gotta talk.\u201d\n\u201cI agreed to marry into this,\u201d Jessica says numbly as Sam gently ushers her out, glancing over his shoulder as he does so. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have an angel as a brother-in-law.\u201d\nDean grimaces and scratches the back of his neck with the barrel of his gun. Castiel looks up at the ceiling, which has water stains from the apartment above. They both very carefully don\u2019t look at each other.\nFinally, Dean breaks the silence. \u201cLook, Cas, about last time\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have laid it on you like that.\u201d\nTELL HIM TO LAY SOMETHING ELSE ON YOU, Hester says in amusement. Castiel inwardly balks.\n\nSISTER!\n\n\nWELL I\u2019M SORRY BUT IF HE WERE ANYMORE OBVIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU IT WOULD BE NAUSEATING.\n\nHESTER, THIS IS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO THE INTENT OF CASTIEL\u2019S MISSION, Zachariah snaps. ALSO IT IS DISGUSTING.\nYOU\u2019RE DISGUSTING, Inias grumbles. He and Hester mesh their Grace together in a way that reminds Castiel of a high five. Zachariah trembles with rage.\nDean is continuing, ignorant to the angels. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a big fan of this destiny crap, and Jo\u2019s my friend but we\u2019re not ever gonna be anything more than that.\u201d He takes a deep breath, then steps forwards and grabs Castiel\u2019s hands between his own, face screwed up in determination. \u201cBut I want to be more than that with you. You\u2019re my best friend and the only person other than Sammy that I trust explicitly with my life.\u201d Castiel stares at him in shock and he bites his lips but plows ahead anyway, nervous. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m reading too much into this but I like to think that you trust me too, and we get on well together, and you know my flaws and accept me anyway and you make me want to be better, to be more, than I am.\u201d\nHis mouth opens and closes a few times before he drops Castiel\u2019s hands and turns away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I fucked up your mission, or whatever. And also our friendship. And also possibly your relationship with your family.\u201d A few moments pass in uncomfortable silence, then Dean\u2019s eyes lift back up to his, green and sad and maybe just a tiny bit watery. \u201cBut, you know. I love you and stuff.\u201d\nCastiel knows what his mission is. Castiel knows that Zachariah is gearing up for a rant of enormous proportions. Castiel knows that what Dean is telling him is probably turning Heaven upside down and inside out. Castiel knows that his siblings are fighting, shouting, screaming different opinions of how they think this needs to play out. These are all things that Castiel knows. What he doesn\u2019t know is what he\u2019s going to do next.\nCastiel reaches out, grabs Dean\u2019s shirt in his hands, and shoves him up against the nearest wall. Dean stares in surprise. Castiel\u2019s siblings fall silent, breathless and preparing to intervene in case he decides to smite Dean for being so presumptuous.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do. He doesn\u2019t know.\nThen, from the silence, comes a Voice. A Voice that Castiel knows, that all Angels know, that all of the malakhim in all of the Choirs know. A Voice that they know and fear, for it is seductive and quiet and it whispers in their ears, burning with frigid fire and temptation, for it is the Voice of the Morning Star and the Fallen One and the Little Horn and Lucifer. The Voice slithers across the Heavenly connection, slow and sure, and Castiel feels it like ice in his veins, clutching at his Grace, sinking into the very fabric of his existence as his brother Lucifer whispers, you should touch his butt.\nThere is a massive, collective inhalation.\nCASTIEL DON\u2019T YOU DARE TOUCH HIS BUTT! Raphael screams in rage.\n\nCASTIEL TOUCH IT TOUCH THE BUTT!\nCASTIEL IF YOU TOUCH THAT HUMAN\u2019S BUTT I\u2019LL RIP YOUR ATOMS INTO SHREDS!\n\n\nRaphael stop being such a snit.\n\n\nSHUT UP LUCIFER!\n\n\nI\u2019LL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR IF YOU TOUCH HIS BUTT.\n\n\nGO AWAY GABRIEL!\n\n\nTOUCH HIS BUTT CASSIE YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO!\n\n\nSatan's right dude just touch his butt already.\n\nCastiel has never been very good at dealing with peer pressure.\nHe touches Dean\u2019s butt.\nHeaven erupts into an all-out war.\nZachariah and Raphael are shrieking threats of Sodom and Gomorrah proportions. The Hashmallim are turning the Second Sphere inside-out trying to keep the peace. Cherubs and Seraphim are leading riots against each other. Balthazar is screaming I WON YOU FUCKERS I WON NOW PAY UP, and Samandriel, who is sensitive, is crying in a corner of the First Sphere while Rachel drops down into her vessel and drinks the entirety of a Las Vegas liquor store.\nDean sticks his tongue in Castiel\u2019s mouth. Castiel, who has never experienced this phenomenon before, thinks that it is pretty damn awesome.\n\nCASTIEL THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO!\n\nTheir mouths slide together, an outpouring of desperation and need. Castiel has never felt these sensations before, has never particularly felt the desire to, but something about Dean Winchester\u2019s soul sings to him, draws him closer, urges him to press up and against.\n\nCASTIEL STOP!\n\nHe ignores his siblings, ignores his purpose, ignores Heaven.\nCastiel pulls back slightly, and when Dean chases after his lips with a quiet whine it draws out a tiny smile. He cups Dean\u2019s face between his hands and kisses again, softly and gently. After the intensity of their first kiss, this one is less charged, but also more intense. Dean\u2019s hands are running through his hair, just barely pulling, and Castiel buries his face into Dean\u2019s shoulder and just breathes.\n\nCASTIEL YOU HAD ONE JOB AND YOU RUINED IT.\n\n\nI\u2019m wondering, does this count as infidelity? It seems like kind of a moral gray area.\n\n\u201cI think I love you and stuff too,\u201d he tells Dean Winchester very seriously, and Dean Winchester smiles.\n------------\n\n...DOES THIS MEAN THAT HARVELLE IS SINGLE?\n\n\nSHUT THE FUCK UP, VIRGIL.\n\n------------\nCastiel flies them somewhere private, somewhere that\u2019s not Sam Winchester\u2019s apartment, and they make love. (Castiel\u2019s siblings watch with a mixture of fascination and disgust, offering insults and encouragement in equal measure. (As Castiel spent most of the time with his dick in Dean\u2019s ass, he found it exceptionally easy to ignore them. (Jimmy spent most of the time feeling pleased but also incredibly uncomfortable since it was technically his dick in Dean\u2019s ass.)))\nWhen the early morning light begins to shine through the windows of the motel room and Castiel is sure that Dean is totally and completely asleep, he flaps his way to the Himalayas. He\u2019s always loved these mountains because he thinks it\u2019s the closest place on the mortal plane to Heaven, and he doesn\u2019t have to deal with his siblings there.\nWith the cold wind whipping at his face and rustling his feathers pleasantly, Castiel takes a deep breath, sinking away from his brothers and sisters, and lets himself feel at peace.\n\nHELLO BELOVED SON.\n\nCastiel very abruptly stops breathing.\n\nOH. FATHER.\n\n\nYOU SEEM RATHER UNENTHUSIASTIC.\n\nCastiel swallows and bows his head. His Father has never seen fit to speak to him directly before.\n\nELOHIM, HOLIEST OF HOLIES, HE-WHO-IS-GOD, FORGIVE MY INDISCRETIONS--\n\n\nFORGIVEN, MY SON, FORGIVEN. ALL IS FORGIVEN. AND I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY AS TO THE NATURE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DEAN-WINCHESTER-WHO-IS-RIGHTEOUS.\n\n\nI HAVE NO SECRETS FROM YOU, BELOVED FATHER.\n\nA Presence fills Castiel. A Presence that encompasses him, sweeps past the consciousness that makes him him, and begins to sift through his memories. Castiel offers them up eagerly to Him, all at once timid and hopeful and wanting approval so very much.\n\nI KNOW THAT THIS GOES AGAINST YOUR PLAN, ELOHIM, BUT DEAN IS VERY ADAMANT ABOUT NOT GOING ALONG WITH DESTINY.\n\nAND HE\u2019S DRAGGED YOU WITH HIM, I SEE, He says, but His Presence is gentle and kind and loving, a caress over Castiel\u2019s feathers that makes his Grace thrum excitedly and dance beneath his skin. Castiel is starlight and moonbeams cradled in flesh, but He is the Sun and the Moon and the Earth and the Sky and All and Nothing and He needs no flesh to contain Him for He cannot be contained. NO MATTER, He continues, THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS FOR DESTINY TO PAN OUT. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY PATHS THAT YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN.\n\nFATHER?\n\n\nIT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT DEAN COULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHTEOUS MAN AND MY SON\u2019S SWORD.\n\nConcern shoots through Castiel, concern for his charge who just recently became his lover. IS THAT STILL POSSIBLE?\n\nNAH.\n\n\nBUT\u2026 WHAT COULD HAVE\u2026\n\n\nWHO CARES IT\u2019S NOT IMPORTANT.\n\nCastiel feels a little underwhelmed.\n\nWHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT NO NEPHILIM COME OF YOUR UNION.\n\nCastiel stops and thinks, and then suddenly realizes that he\u2019s getting the talk.\n\nREMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME, BELOVED SON?\n\n\nYES. YOU KILLED PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE.\n\n\nYES, YES. NASTY BUSINESS. WOULDN\u2019T HAVE HAPPENED IF YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS HADN\u2019T DABBLED. OF COURSE, IF CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN NOTHING WILL COME TO BE.\n\n\nBELOVED FATHER, ARE YOU TELLING ME NOT TO GET PREGNANT?\nBELOVED SON, I\u2019M SIMPLY SAYING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO LAYING WITH HUMANS, PERHAPS IT IS BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE. IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.\n\nCastiel feels an incredibly human amount of embarrassment and buries his face into his hands.\n\nNOW, ON THE MATTER OF YOUR VESSEL, JAMES NOVAK. IT SEEMS RATHER UNFAIR TO KEEP HIM FROM HIS FAMILY, DOESN\u2019T IT?\n\nAshamed, Castiel nods. He\u2019s thought about this, struggled with the decision about what to do, but he\u2019s guilty of the fact that for the most part he\u2019s taken Jimmy for granted. He remembers now more than ever, in the face of his Father, that this is not his body. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?\n\nYOU? YOU\u2019LL DO NOTHING. JAMES NOVAK IS HOME NOW, IN HIS OWN BODY. YOU HAVE BEEN BEREFT OF HIM SINCE I BEGAN SPEAKING TO YOU. HIS FAMILY KNOWS WHERE HE HAS BEEN AND HE HAS RETAINED ALL MEMORIES. HE IS DEVOUT AND FAITHFUL AND HE HAS WEATHERED YOUR STORM THIS LAST YEAR WITH LITTLE RESENTMENT, CONSIDERING. HE IS FREE OF YOU, AND YOU OF HIM. IT IS MY GIFT TO HIM.\n\nCastiel stares down at his body, which is definitely Jimmy\u2019s, but now that he reaches for the human\u2019s consciousness he realizes that he can\u2019t feel it. For the first time in a very long time, he is completely alone within himself, save for His Presence. I DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND. HOW\u2026\n\nTHIS IS YOUR FAVORED APPEARANCE, AND DEAN WINCHESTER\u2019S, TOO. I AM NOT SO VENGEFUL AS THE HUMANS SEEM TO THINK. JAMES NOVAK IS NO LONGER A VESSEL BECAUSE THIS SHELL IS THE VESSEL. HIS BODY IS FRESH AND NEW AND YOU MAY KEEP THIS EMPTY ONE. THIS IS MY GIFT TO YOU.\n\n\nTHANK YOU, BELOVED FATHER. TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IS MORE THAN I EVER COULD HAVE HOPED.\n\n\nYOU GUYS NEED TO STOP WITH THAT HERO WORSHIP STUFF, SERIOUSLY.\n\nBefore he can say anything else, the Presence slips away from him, and his Father disappears back into the void of nothingness that He seems to dwell in. Castiel\u2019s breath shudders in his lungs and he feels small, too small, standing here at the top of the world, so he flaps his wings and lands back in his motel room, where Dean stirs at the sound of feathers.\n\u201cCas?\u201d he rasps, throat sore and voice rough. Despite himself, Castiel feels a thrill of pleasure, and he allows Dean to pull him into the bed and fold up against him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he murmurs reverently, inexplicably tired from his conversation with his Father. He cards his fingers through Dean\u2019s hair and smiles at the hum of contentment that the action draws out. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d\n------------\n\u201cSo can I be the best man?\u201d Jo Harvelle asks with a shit-eating grin. \u201cSince I did kinda get you two together?\u201d\nCastiel sips at his appletini. \u201cI suppose, if you want to fight Jimmy for it. He\u2019s already sharing it with Sam, though.\u201d\nJo frowns and picks at Cas\u2019s hand, twisting the plain silver band around his ring finger idly. \u201cLame. I guess I can settle for maid of honor.\u201d\n\nI ALREADY CALLED THAT.\n\n\u201cBalthazar has claimed that position as well. And I should warn you, he's adamant about wearing the dress.\u201d\n\nI LOOK FETCHING IN IT.\n\nShe sighs in disgust and leans back in her chair. \u201cWhatever. Virgil said he was going to show me his weapon collection during the ceremony anyway.\u201d\nCastiel has a feeling that he should be worried about that.\nBut instead, he just smiles."
