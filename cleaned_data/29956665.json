    "summary": "<p>The Multiplayers are a faceless band that the internet has gone wild about. They started by playing covers and posting them on YouTube but now they\u2019ve got a slew of original songs and one hell of a fanbase. </p>\n<p>Tubbo, Ranboo, and Tommy started the band as a joke after a stream one day because \u201coh, haha, we all play instruments!\u201d but now people actually like their songs\u2026 not that anybody actually knows the songs are theirs.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>IMPORTANT: alrighty, so some of you may know this, some of you may not, but this fic used to have Purpled in it. However, Purpled recently stated that he actually doesn\u2019t want irl him in fics, only his dsmp character, so I\u2019ve rewritten the fic so that he is no longer in it. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve simply replaced all of the chapters of the older version with the new one in the same fic so that people wouldn\u2019t lose their bookmarks. This means that there are going to be some comments about Purpled in the comments section but he\u2019s not actually in the fic anymore so don\u2019t worry!</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve left the author\u2019s notes from the original version as well (some altered to exclude purpled), but I\u2019ve also added new notes to some chapters! The Original notes will usually come before the new ones!</p>\n<p>If you notice purpled anywhere (or any other purpled related inconsistencies) please let me know so I can fix it!</p>\n<p>While I am sad to see the original version go, making sure I am within everyone\u2019s boundaries is top priority!! </p>\n<p>Original Notes:<br>Hi!

I haven't checked to see if they actually exist and if they do those people aren't actually connected to this fic!</p>\n<p>Anyway, here\u2019s chapter two!</p>\n<p>-Cal</p>\n<p>New Notes:<br>Welcome to chapter 2. Again, if you\u2019re confused about any changes to the fic, read the beginning notes of ch. 1!</p>\n<p>Also, to clarify, Ranboo is still mainly the bassist of the band. In future, if they were to do live performances and stuff, they\u2019d pre-record the guitar parts and they would just play them as a backing track to the rest of their instrumentalization.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Original Notes:<br>New Songs Mentioned This Chapter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWY4ck6yr4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cHome\u201d</a> by One Direction - thank you milkyumiitea for reminding me of this song</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh9NGs-W5bk\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cI Want\u201d</a> by One Direction - Yes, for the One Direction fans out there, The Multiplayers did in fact change the line \u201cdifferent date every night\u201d to \u201cdifferent dick every night\u201d when they recorded the song.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV1lpw8cUsg\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cGood Kid\u201d</a> from The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical - this musical is a masterpiece.

For example, this line \u201cHe\u2019s always been a little better at improv than Tubbo,\u201d about Tommy should be taken with a grain of salt. Tubbo is, on occasion, an unreliable narrator. It doesn\u2019t really matter who\u2019s better or worse!</p>\n<p>Original Notes:<br>Hi! I meant to have this chapter out yesterday but it wasn\u2019t agreeing with me. I ended up changing it a lot from what I was originally planning for the chapter but I think it works way better than it would\u2019ve if I hadn\u2019t changed it. </p>\n<p>Sorry for the constant cliffhangers, by the way!

It\u2019s more or less the same dynamic that Tubbo and Ranboo have with their whole platonic marriage thing on the smp. Except for the fact that Tubbo is Player One which means they can\u2019t actually be shipped together\u2026 </p>\n<p>New Songs Mentioned This Chapter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWv7Vfku6w4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cChannel 5 News: The Musical\u201d</a> by Bo Burnham </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj_fZjn3zQc\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cTwo Player Game\u201d</a> from Be More Chill (featuring George Salazar and Will Connolly) - Suggested by someone anonymous on Tumblr with advice on who should sing what part from Twitter and Tumblr - Chapter Title from this song</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa0Swz3X1cQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cYour New Boyfriend\u201d</a> by Wilbur Soot - I figure we probably all know this one..?</p>\n<p>(\u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d is another CalistaWon original. This is probably my favourite of the ones that I\u2019ve written? Not sure, though.)</p>\n<p>The podcast and the record label are fake. I have no idea how record labels actually work so we\u2019re just going to pretend like this is it. I figured since Wilbur doesn\u2019t use Twitter, he wouldn\u2019t contact them that way, and he probably wouldn\u2019t do it in a YouTube comment. The Multiplayers don\u2019t have a public business email, so contacting the label would seem like the best option. </p>\n<p>Again, check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GhostFox667/status/1370645060845469699\" rel=\"nofollow\">this cosplay</a> of Ranboo singing \u201cWeird!\u201d by Dream_nootInnit (@/GhostFox667 on Twitter)! </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>-Cal</p>\n<p>edit 18/06/2021: hurricanekadence created I'll Be There!!

I have gotten to the point of reuploading this fic where i've decided i hate formatting. Why did i involve so many tweets in this fic??? </p>\n<p>in all seriousness, though, while formatting is really difficult, i'm glad i'm doing this. it gave me a chance to go back and fix grammatical mistakes (i'm sure i've missed plenty, but still) and it's a huge relief off of my chest. the half hour between when i found out about purpled's new boundaries and when i figured out how to hide the fic without deleting so i could rewrite it, i felt so bad? i'm happy i'm fixing it!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Original Notes (edited):<br>New Songs Mentioned This Chapter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeiYxdteTQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d</a> by Weathers - This was recommended in the comments of a previous chapter by AnneOfTheDawn.

The only one I'm super attached to is air bender Tommy)</p>\n<p>About Ranboo travelling to the UK: please don\u2019t travel unless you have to! And if you have to stay safe! The timeline of this story is vague enough that I figured I could get away with them travelling.

I can\u2019t believe this is the end! Which is why it might not be! I\u2019m thinking about writing a sequel (though I\u2019m not sure yet, so no promises!) I really like this world I\u2019ve created. Writing it, writing these characters and all the shenanigans that they get themselves into, it\u2019s honestly been so much fun. </p>\n<p>So yeah, I won\u2019t promise anything, and I really don\u2019t want to overwrite this (if that makes sense), but I do have ideas that I wasn\u2019t able to get around to in this book. It would be nice to write more! That being said, I do have other fics I want to write (for example, I need to finish my Broadway Ranboo fic \u201cKing of New York\u201d) so if a sequel does happen, it might not be right away!</p>\n<p>I honestly can\u2019t thank you all enough for commenting, leaving kudos, and continuing to read every chapter! When I first started writing this, my plan was to have two or three fun little chapters about these four being a band. That\u2026 didn\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m so glad that you guys stuck around! </p>\n<p>Lastly, I am currently setting up a Discord server. I\u2019ve never done that before so it\u2019s taking some time. (If anybody has any tips/suggestions, feel free to let me know!) Once it\u2019s ready, I will possibly - temporarily? - add another chapter onto this fic that will just have the link to the Discord for those of you who want to join. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be in my ao3 profile and i\u2019ll probably link it on twitter and tumblr. </p>\n<p>Thanks again (I know, I keep saying that)</p>\n<p>-Cal</p>\n<p>(tldr: Possible sequel, thank you!!!, Discord server coming soon, thank you!!!)</p>\n<p>New Notes:<br>Yep | @Hen118 is my favourite OC</p>\n<p>Alright, I'm going to say thank you again. Not surprising. Like I said before, while I will miss the original version of this fic, I'm not upset about having to change it. I don't want anything that goes against cc boundaries in my ao3 works. So thank you all for bearing with me while I hid the fic and reworked it. </p>\n<p>Also, thank you for 100k hits! that's so cool! </p>\n<p>Alright, one last thing, the 'possible sequel' i mentioned in the original notes IS happening! I'm in the process of writing it and i will hopefully begin uploading chapters soon! (don't worry, this doesn't mean i've abandoned the other works i'm currently writing! I'll still be updating those!)</p>\n<p>I have a Spotify playlist! I\u2019ll be adding all of the original songs that The Multiplayers make covers of to it as I write the story!

    "text": "It starts with Bedwars. Ranboo had wanted to do a video with Tommy and Tubbo so they\u2019d joined one of his streams to get footage. Tubbo has fun. It\u2019s nice to just let loose and have a little fun with his friends every once in a while. When the stream ends, Tommy and Ranboo continue to play while Tubbo messes around with his keyboard, playing random songs into the mic.\u00a0\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tubbo exclaims at one point.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Ranboo asks.\u00a0\n\u201cShit!\u201d Tommy shouts as his character gets knocked into the void.\u00a0\n\u201cI got a new instrument!\u201d Tubbo says happily, ignoring Tommy\u2019s grumbling.\n\u201cWhat is it? Another ukulele?\u201d Ranboo jokes. Tubbo snickers, looking to the several ukuleles he\u2019s already got hanging on his wall.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tubbo says. \u201cIt\u2019s a synthesizer.\u201d\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d Ranboo asks. \u201cA synth?\u201d\u00a0\nTubbo hums in conformation. It\u2019s a really cool instrument and though it took a while to get the hang of it, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s half bad. He\u2019s created some pretty great sounds with it.\u00a0\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cThat\u2019s actually pretty cool.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Tubbo says, then laughs as Tommy dies and Ranboo wins the game.\u00a0\n\u201cFucking hell!\u201d Tommy shouts. He sighs and they start up a new game. Halfway through, Tommy starts laughing, \u201cHa! Everybody but Ranboo plays an instrument.\u201d\n\u201cWait what do you play?\u201d Ranboo asks.\n\u201cPiano,\u201d Tommy admits immediately, then, clearing his throat, he quietly adds, \u201cand drums.\u201d\n\u201cYou play drums?\u201d Ranboo asks, ignoring the jab.\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d Tommy shouts as he wins a fight and breaks somebody\u2019s bed. \u201cAnd yes, I play the drums. What of it?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, just\u2026\u201d Ranboo starts laughing uncontrollably. \u201cWe- we could make a band!\u201d he barely gets the words out as he laughs. Tubbo starts laughing too. That would be cool. And hilarious. Twitter would have a field day.\u00a0\n\u201cAre we ignoring the fact that you can\u2019t play an instrument?\u201d Tubbo asks him.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust what Tommy says,\u201d Ranboo tells the other boy. \u201cI play bass.\u201d\n...\nSo, Tubbo knows it started as a joke but\u2026 it actually sounds pretty cool. Starting a band, that is. Turns out, Ranboo also knows how to play guitar. It\u2019s a few days later and they\u2019re all on call with one another again, none of them streaming, when  Tommy, of all people, brings it up again.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat would we even call ourselves?\u201d Tommy jokes. He gets three answers in quick succession.\n\u201cThe Bumblebees,\u201d Tubbo jokes immediately.\n\u201cThe Children,\u201d Ranboo suggests, even less seriously.\n\u201cThe Multiplayers,\u201d Tubbo says.\u00a0\nThe call goes silent for a moment, then Ranboo says, \u201cHold on. Tubbo, that isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u00a0\n...\nOne thing leads to another and\u2026 suddenly, they\u2019re posting a song to YouTube on a new channel called The Multiplayers. The channel isn\u2019t linked to any of them and the song is just an audio - over an image of a sunset Ranboo took a while ago - so nobody can connect their faces to their channels. They collectively decided that they wouldn\u2019t show their faces as The Multiplayers so that if people liked them, they liked them for the music, not because they were already fans. Plus, it\u2019s kind of funny having some sort of secret identity.\u00a0\nThe song they post is a cover of \u201cWeird!\u201d by Yungblud and Tubbo isn\u2019t sure how it happened but he ends up being lead vocals. It was difficult to put together, considering they\u2019re scattered across two different countries and all. However, with learning how to use the synth, Tubbo learned a little about mixing too, so he was able to put all of their separate pieces together into one song.\u00a0\nRanboo ends up having to record twice, since he\u2019s the designated bass player  and the designated guitar player, but it works out in the end.\nThe video gets four views, and three likes, probably from Yungblud fans who were just looking for covers.\u00a0\nNone of them really care that it doesn\u2019t get much attention. It was just a fun thing they figured they\u2019d do because  why not?\u00a0 \nAfter doing \u201cWeird!\u201d and generally having a lot of fun with it, Ranboo suggests they just keep doing covers. Tommy agrees, citing that it\u2019s nice to actually be doing something with his drumming knowledge since he hasn\u2019t really played much since getting big on Twitch (and since starting college).\u00a0\n\u201cEven if mother and fatherinnit complain about all the noise,\u201d Tommy says, as if he\u2019s actually making more noise than he usually does (he\u2019s not, it\u2019s just a different  kind of noise).\nThe second song they do is \u201cTechno Show\u201d by Peach Pit. It doesn\u2019t really require any piano or synth which ends up reinforcing Tubbo\u2019s role as lead vocalist. Tommy ends up as, like, the  lead backing vocalist  because Ranboo isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s comfortable actually recording his singing yet. Ranboo also ends up having to do both the lead guitar  and the rhythm guitar parts in addition to the bass parts. It\u2019s fine, though, because then Tubbo just mixes it all together.\u00a0\nThe video is once again only audio with no video footage, just a poor-quality photo Tubbo took of a rainy sky last week. This time they overlay the photo with the title of the song and the original band\u2019s name, as well as their band\u2019s name.\u00a0\nIt gets one view, one like, not that any of them notice. They  are still busy doing other things like making videos and streaming on the Dream SMP.\u00a0\n...\nTommy proposes they cover Taylor Swift on the same day that Ranboo suggests they make a TikTok account, which Tommy vehemently opposes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt  is  how I got big as a streamer, though,\u201d Ranboo urges. \u201cWell, that and the SMP\u2026 But it would give our band a bit more exposure! We just have to upload, like, a few seconds of one of our covers and then tell people to check us out on YouTube.\u201d\nTommy leaves the Discord call. Tubbo laughs, snorting at his friend\u2019s antics. When Tommy returns a few seconds later, he sighs heavily. \u201cFine,\u201d he pretends to say begrudgingly, \u201cwe\u2019ll make a TikTok.\u201d\nThey record a cover of \u201cBetty\u201d first. It\u2019s a little more pop-punk than Taylor Swift\u2019s version but it sounds nice. Tubbo gets to play around with some effects on the vocals (his again, he thinks he may have officially been dubbed lead singer) when he\u2019s mixing the song to get a sort of far-away effect on the second part of the pre-chorus after verse three.\u00a0\nThey post the audio from the first chorus on TikTok.\u00a0\nThey post the full cover on YouTube.\n\u00a0\u201cBetty\u201d gets forty-six views, and twenty-seven likes. The Multiplayers get eleven subscribers.\n...\nIt\u2019s  One Direction that makes The Multiplayers famous. It\u2019s been a few months since they started the band. They\u2019ve covered songs like \u201cMinutes Away\u201d by Jeremy Shada, \u201cShotgun\u201d by George Ezra (in which Ranboo joined Tommy in doing backing vocals), a few more Peach Pit songs, and \u201cCabinet Man\u201d by Lemon Demon. Tommy has been teaching himself guitar so that he and Ranboo can alternate playing for different songs.\nAnd then Tubbo and Tommy are in a call with the Dream Team and Quackity one night. And Sapnap is streaming. And he gets a dono asking him what his favourite One Direction song is.\u00a0\nSapnap, Dream, and Quackity get into a small debate over it and eventually conclude that Midnight Memories and Night Changes are pretty okay.\nTubbo knows that the second they say that, Tommy  must have a shit-eating grin on his face. Sure enough, just a second after everyone has moved on from One Direction, Tommy sends something to The Multiplayers Discord chat.\u00a0\nAnd  that is how they end up doing a cover of \u201cMidnight Memories\u201d by One Direction.\nAll three of them sing. They each play their parts. Tubbo mixes it all together.\u00a0\nThey post it on YouTube.\nThey post a clip of it on TikTok.\u00a0\nIt  blows up.\u00a0\nThe  band blows up.\u00a0\nBecause of  One  fucking  Direction.\nTubbo laughs about it with Ranboo for a good ten minutes after they realize that.\u00a0\n...\nA week after  One Direction, The Multiplayers have a pretty decent following. A lot of the people who watched \u201cMidnight Memories\u201d clearly went back and listened to their other covers because the viewer counts on those increase drastically.\u00a0\nBut then people start  asking about them. The band has created a Twitter and an Instagram at this point and they keep getting questions. Who are you? How many members are in your band? Do you make original music? What are your names? Who plays what?\u00a0\nSo they go with:\n\u00a0\nPlayer One: Keys/synth, lead vocals.\nPlayer Two: Bass, guitar, backing vocals\nPlayer Three: Drums, some guitar, lead backing vocals\n\u00a0\nAnd people kind of  love it. They like the mystery, the secrecy, the unknown. And so, The Multiplayers amass a following.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cI wrote a song,\u201d is the first thing Tubbo says when The Multiplayers have their next call. He\u2019s really excited about it, especially since he wrote it for his ukulele instead of on keys.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\u201cAre you guys being serious?\u201d Tommy asks, sounding incredulous. Is this something to be incredulous about?\u00a0\n\u201cYes?\u201d Tubbo responds. Ranboo hums. Tommy starts laughing, which isn\u2019t unusual for Tommy but is unusual in the sense that Tubbo doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s funny.\u00a0\n\u201cI wrote a song as well,\u201d Tommy says, catching his breath. Okay, yeah, it\u2019s pretty funny, Tubbo must admit.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Tommy, really?\u201d Ranboo asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy says, a little defensively. \u201cYou sound surprised. Don\u2019t think I can do it, Big Man?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know writing was something you wanted to do. Let\u2019s hear it. But, uh, before you start. I should tell you guys that I may have also written another one. A song, I mean. I\u2019ve got two.\u201d\n...\nThey end up releasing one of Ranboo\u2019s songs first, mostly because it\u2019s easier to add other instruments to a song that was originally written on a guitar. At least, for them it is. They aren\u2019t exactly  professionals. It takes them a while to figure things out, but once they get into the swing of writing, they all get pretty excited about it.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s called \u201cLost and Losing\u201d and somehow, despite being written by their lead guitarist, didn\u2019t have a guitar solo until  after the other two of them had gotten their hands on it. It\u2019s a bit of a slower pop-rock song and Tubbo really enjoys the bridge;\n\n When rivers dry\n\nLeaving scars behind,\n\nAnd when cities sink\n\nBeneath waves and rage,\n\nI\u2019ll wander,\nAnd I\u2019ll wonder,\n\nAre we out of time?\n\nThey use The Multiplayers\u2019 Twitter to contact an artist, commissioning them to make cover art for the song. Unfortunately, the only artists they really know of are ones who often make fanart for the Dream SMP, which means that a rumour starts that The Multiplayers are fans of the SMP. It\u2019s not terrible, but they  would  have liked for there to be absolutely  no connection between the band and the SMP.\u00a0\nFortunately, people who make Dream SMP fanart are  very  good at what they do, and the cover art turns out  amazing.  (And, if, because of the rumours, their following grows a little bit, well, they aren\u2019t complaining. There\u2019s a reason they post their music to YouTube. They want to share it with people.)\n...\nThe song gets really popular. The following they had from their covers only grows. \u201cLost and Losing\u201d gets nine thousand views in its first week. That\u2019s nothing compared to the numbers that they get as gaming youtubers and streamers but it\u2019s pretty significant considering their band has only existed for a few months.\u00a0\nThings are going well. Things are going  great! People actually enjoy their music, whether it\u2019s their original song or their covers. Tubbo loves reading the comments that talk about each of them individually. The ones that say  the bass sounds so good!  The ones that say  that person\u2019s an amazing drummer, wow.  The ones that say  that piano sounds extraordinary.  The ones that say  their voices sound great together! \u00a0\nBecause those comments mean that their band is actually doing something. It means that they aren\u2019t just deluding themselves into thinking they\u2019re good at music.\u00a0\nAnd well, nice comments are just that:  nice.\u00a0\nSo yeah, things are going well. And then Wilbur\u2019s stream happens.\u00a0\n...\nWilbur\u2019s doing a Just Chatting stream. Tommy and Tubbo have already been Facetiming each other for hours when Wilbur starts his stream and now Tommy wants to call Wilbur to bug him, which means that Tubbo\u2019s going to join along for sure.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing media shares,\u201d Wilbur explains to Tommy, Tubbo, and the chat. \u201cBut this won\u2019t be a You Laugh, You Lose. This is just going to be a chill stream.\u201d\n\u201cA chill stream?\u201d Tubbo asks. \u201cBye Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cOi! Fuck off,\u201d Tommy shouts. Wilbur lets out a fake long-suffering sigh.\u00a0\nThings start off with a few funny videos. The three of them chat in between clips while Wilbur fucks around on the Origins smp. He said they could hop onto the server, too, but Tubbo\u2019s already in bed and Tommy says it\u2019s \u201ctoo much work\u201d to set up, or something like that.\u00a0\nA huge slew of animatics come next, which Tubbo thoroughly enjoys. There are plenty of new ones that he hasn\u2019t had the chance to see yet. Tommy ends up going off on a tangent about how cool animators are which makes Wilbur  aw at him. Tommy grumbles and Tubbo starts cackling-\n-and then he\u2019s not laughing anymore because  that\u2019s our song playing. That\u2019s \u201cLost and Loosing\u201d. Oh my god, what the hell?\u00a0 \nHe focuses his attention back on Wilbur\u2019s stream and  there it is. Someone media-shared the  entire song.\u00a0\nTubbo notices subconsciously that Tommy has also gone completely silent, but he\u2019s too caught up in watching Wilbur. \u201cLost and Losing\u201d by The Multiplayers is currently playing on Wilbur\u2019s stream and Wilbur has  no idea that two of the band\u2019s members are currently in a call with him.\u00a0\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Wilbur says. Through his headphones, Tubbo hears Tommy suck in a breath. It\u2019s quiet enough that Wilbur probably hasn\u2019t heard it. Tubbo knows exactly what Tommy\u2019s feeling. Wilbur makes music too. Wilbur is  great at making music. What he says next\u2026 what he says about their song, it\u2019s important to both of them. \u201cThis is really good.\u201d\nTubbo, thankfully, remembers to mute himself before letting out a breath. He slumps a little, the built-up tension in his body beginning to flow out. Running a hand down his face, he quickly unmutes himself again.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Wilbur is saying. \u201cWhat is this? I want to find them.\u201d\nOne of Wilbur\u2019s mods spams the link to The Multiplayers\u2019 YouTube channel in the chat. Wilbur pulls the channel up on his stream, but he doesn\u2019t start any of the videos yet. The media-shared song is still playing and it looks like Wilbur is really enjoying it. Tubbo can\u2019t help the grin that spreads on his face.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Wilbur says when the song ends, \u201cI\u2019m going to pause the media-shares for a second so I can listen to some of the other stuff The Multiplayers have done. It looks like that was their only original song but I really like their sound,\u201d he smiles wide. \u201cI love finding new music to listen to.\u201d\nHe puts on their cover of \u201cBetty\u201d and the second it starts, his eyes go wide. \u201cWow,\u201d he says, \u201cthis  has a different sound. It\u2019s actually very good though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nIt\u2019s then that Tubbo remembers he\u2019s not just watching Wilbur\u2019s stream. He and Tommy are still in a call with him. Oops.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tubbo says, hoping it isn\u2019t too obvious that his voice definitely just cracked. \u201cThey sound pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a Taylor Swift song?\u201d Tommy asks, trying and failing to sound incredulous. Instead, he sounds a bit like he\u2019s choking. God, you\u2019d think for two people who act in a Minecraft roleplay all the time, they\u2019d be better at\u2026 acting.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Wilbur says, stopping \u201cBetty\u201d partway through and putting on \u201cShotgun\u201d instead, \u201cthe lead singer sounds a bit like you Tubbo, don\u2019t they?\u201d\nTubbo\u2019s eyes go wide. Oh no. They\u2019re busted. Their secret is out. Now everybody\u2019s going to know who The Multiplayers are and the band won\u2019t know who actually likes their music and who\u2019s just a fan because they were  already a fan. This is it.\u00a0\n\u201cHa! If Tubbo could actually properly sing!\u201d Tommy jokes. A thank god Tommy managed to snap out of it. He\u2019s always been a little better at improv than Tubbo.\u00a0\n\u201cTommy\u2026\u201d Wilbur tries to scold. Tubbo just laughs. Finally, the last threads of tension leave his body. Everything\u2019s okay. Their secret isn\u2019t out. It looks like Wilbur is about to say something else, but he gets distracted by the screen. \u201cOh! They did a Peach Pit cover!\u201d\u00a0\n...\nTheir other original songs still need a little work, so they decide to do a few more covers in the meantime. After Wilbur\u2019s stream, their fanbase grew a hell of a lot bigger. They pulled a bunch of Wilbur\u2019s fans but also a lot of Tommy and Tubbo\u2019s as well (while there is some overlap in their fanbases, Tommy\u2019s is indisputably larger and Tubbo\u2019s has grown past just Minecraft due to his variety alt streams).\u00a0\nSo they do more covers. They can\u2019t just leave thousands of people hanging, can they?\u00a0\nWell, they probably can, but they\u2019re a band made up of three people with YouTube and Twitch content creator mentalities.\u00a0\nAfter their One Direction cover, they get several requests for even more One Direction. At first, they weren\u2019t going to do any more, but people seem to really like \u201cMidnight Memories\u201d so Tubbo started listening to more of One Direction\u2019s discography. It turns out, Ranboo did the same, because they each suggest a One Direction song for their next cover.\n\u201cDid you two coordinate this?\u201d Tommy asks accusingly. \u201cAre we turning into a boyband?\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t we already a boyband?\u201d Ranboo asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy all but shrieks. \u201cWe are  not! \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Ranboo shrugs (they\u2019ve all got their cameras on. Ranboo doesn\u2019t wear his mask, gloves and glasses for these calls anymore), \u201cwe  are  a band and we  are all boys\u2026 Unless one of you isn\u2019t! Which is totally cool, too.\u201d\nNobody speaks up so Tommy sighs and says, \u201cAnyway, what were those songs you suggested again?\u201d\u00a0\nRanboo suggests \u201cHome\u201d because it sounds great and he likes the lyrics.\u00a0\nTubbo suggests \u201cI Want\u201d because he thinks the piano part, while fairly simple, will be really fun to play.\nThey end up just doing both, because why not?\nThe piano part in \u201cI Want\u201d  is really fun to play, Tubbo discovers. He sings alone whenever only one member of One Direction is singing, but when they all sing together, Tommy and Ranboo join in.\u00a0\nDoing more songs where he does a lot of backing vocals must be what leads Tommy to the day that he, out of the blue, says, \u201cGuys, I\u2019ve got a song I want to try,\u201d then nervously, adds, \u201cbut I was wondering if I could sing it, perhaps?\u201d\nTheir cover of \u201cGood Kid\u201d from The Lightning Thief musical does really well. Their fans freak out about it because the vocals sound different and in the credits, which they\u2019ve recently started adding, \u201clead vocals\u201d sits beside Player Three instead of Player One.\u00a0\n...\nMaya Dean | @M_ayaDean#askthemultiplayers How old are you?\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayersNot very-P2\n\u00a0\nCongrats it\u2019s a demigod | @Steph47#askthemultiplayers More musicals?\u00a0\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayersYes\u00a0-P2\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayersMaybe -P3\n\u00a0\nProbably a Fan | @Tabitha_Riley\u00a0#askthemultiplayers Ok but are you gonna reveal your faces at some point?

P1 sounds like he\u2019s from the UK but one of the background singers (not sure who) sounds American?\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayersP1 and P3 are from the UK. I\u2019m American. We record everything separately and then P1 mixes it.\nYep | @Hen118Oh wow\n...\nThey start getting fanart. Like,  actual The Multiplayers fanart. A lot of it is of instruments with fancy \u2018Player\u2019 labels to denote each member. Some artists take random multiplayer video games and design instruments in the art style the video games are in.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also some fanart that includes actual people. Artists try to imagine what each member of The Multiplayers looks like. They\u2019re never accurate but Tubbo scrolls through them anyway.\u00a0\nOne thing that Tubbo notices because of the art is that they\u2019ve accidentally used the colours associated with their  streamer selves in the credits of their The Multiplayers videos. Player One is always in green font, Player Two is either in white or black font, depending on the background colour they chose for the credits, and of course, Player Three is in red.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not super obvious, considering they\u2019re just a bunch of random colours to most people, but Tubbo does believe they should have probably thought that through a little more. It means that there\u2019s a bunch of art circulating that involves green-themed keyboards, black and white bass guitars, and red-themed drums (with the occasional black and white or red guitar).\u00a0\nThankfully, it doesn\u2019t seem like anybody has put two and two together yet. Tubbo is grateful that Tommy managed to stop any rumours of Tubbo sounding like Player One before they could start. He still can\u2019t quite believe that Wilbur even picked up one that. Then again, Wilbur  has heard Tubbo sing before.\nThey release Tommy\u2019s original song next. It\u2019s another pop-rock song, but more fast-paced than \u201cLost and Losing\u201d, called \u201cMasked\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd no,\u201d Tommy had clarified when he\u2019d first shown it to them, \u201cit\u2019s not inspired by Dream. Fuck off.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a song with a lot of storytelling, which is why Tubbo suspects that Tommy was influenced by Wilbur\u2019s music, at least a little. When he brings it up while they\u2019re rehearsing one day, Tommy loudly explains that \u201cNo, Wilbur was influenced by  me!\u201d Which basically means, \u201cYes, obviously,\u201d in Tommy-speak.\u00a0\nThe story, on the surface, is about a girl running away from someone trying to  murder  her. She\u2019s trying to find the love of her life, hoping he\u2019ll help keep her safe, only to discover that the person trying to kill her  is her lover. In the end, she doesn\u2019t need anybody to save her. She can save herself, dammit.\u00a0\nSo yeah, on the surface, it seems a bit basic, but it turns out that Tommy is a really great storyteller. And, he\u2019s surprisingly good at  metaphors. The whole song\u2019s a damned metaphor.\u00a0\nThat being said, it does take them a while to get the music just right. Not only because writing music can be difficult (none of them are what you\u2019d call experienced) but also due to the different time zones they\u2019re in. Figuring out when the best time for everyone is can be difficult, especially because they have to factor in the fact that all three of them stream and make videos. And that\u2019s not even mentioning school.\u00a0\nWhen they  do  finish writing \u201cMasked\u201d, there\u2019s a heavy and somewhat complicated bassline during the verses (like, \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d level of  heavy) while the choruses end up being more soft-rock; light and airy sounding, but to the point that it seems unsettling.\u00a0\nTubbo thinks the best part of the song starts at verse three (there are five verses and no bridge). He likes it because Tommy\u2019s drumming sets the scene for you, immersing you in it.\u00a0\n\n His footfalls are approaching\nWhile the shadows are encroaching\nOn her, poaching\nAny confidence\nShe once had within.\n\n\n \nAnd his mask falls.\nAnd her heart stalls. \n\nAnd then Tommy\u2019s drum solo kicks in.\u00a0\n...\nThey put \u201cLost and Losing\u201d and \u201cMasked\u201d on Spotify (once they figure out how). Masked also gets its own cover art, from a new artist this time. They actually chose one from The Multiplayers\u2019 following and everything! Both songs immediately get tons of streams. It\u2019s pretty cool that they\u2019re being noticed, Tubbo thinks.\nIt\u2019s also sort of terrifying. Tubbo  likes that they\u2019re a faceless band. He likes that \u201cTubbo\u201d isn\u2019t connected to The Multiplayers. Knowing that he can hide behind Player One - knowing that nobody knows who Player One is - makes Tubbo more confident in his singing. In his musical abilities. He knows the others feel the same.\u00a0\n...\nTubbo\u2019s signing some things regarding TubNet with Philza\u2019s stream pulled up in the background one evening. Phil\u2019s on his hardcore world, working on his latest project. Tubbo likes watching his friends\u2019 streams and they definitely tend to make working more bearable.\nAbout halfway through the stream, Wilbur and Tommy turn up to chat with Phil and generally be obnoxious, as they often do. He knows that the three of them were filming one of Tommy\u2019s mod videos with some others earlier.\u00a0\nTubbo signs the last page and begins to gather up his papers. He\u2019s sort of scattered his work all over his desk. As he sets about his task, Tubbo starts humming along to the song that Phil has playing in the background of his stream. It\u2019s when the song gets to the first chorus that it hits him.\nThe song playing is \u201cGood Kid\u201d.\nSung by Player Three.\u00a0\nHoly shit.\u00a0\nPhilza Minecraft has listened to The Multiplayers?\nTubbo\u2019s head snaps up to look back at the screen.\u00a0\n\u201cOh! Phil,\u201d Wilbur says, excited, \u201cyou listened to them!\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Phil says, bobbing his head along to the song. \u201cBy the way, Chat, Wilbur is talking about the song that\u2019s playing. It\u2019s a cover by this band called- um...\u201d\n\u201cThe Multiplayers,\u201d Tommy stammers. Neither Phil nor Wilbur seem to notice that Tommy most definitely sounds panicked. The song playing  is the one he sang alone, after all.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Phil continues. \u201cThe Multiplayers. Wilbur told me to check them out. They\u2019re very good.\u201d\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Wilbur agrees. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got two original songs as well. I quite like both of them, truthfully.\u201d\nOh wow. Wilbur genuinely likes their music. Phil too, if he added one of their covers to his streaming playlist.\u00a0\n\u201cTommy?\u201d Phil probes after a moment. Tommy has been fairly quiet since the song started, which is very unlike him. Tubbo can tell that Phil\u2019s a little worried about him, though he probably just thinks Tommy is tired.\u00a0\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cHave you listened to them yet?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Tommy pops the \u2018p\u2019. \u201cFirst heard them on Wilbur\u2019s stream, actually. They\u2019re alright.\u201d\n They\u2019re alright.\u00a0\nWell, okay then, Tommy.\u00a0\n\u201cThey, uh,\u201d Tommy continues.  No!  Tubbo thinks.  Stop! Before you dig yourself into a hole! Don\u2019t you remember the lesbianinnit incident? \u201cLet\u2019s think about this one\u201d??? Tommy! \u201cGood bass.\u201d\nTubbo bursts out laughing.\u00a0\n...\nLater that same night, Tubbo gets a message from Karl Jacobs on Discord. Tubbo is tired and he isn\u2019t thinking straight, which is why, without really thinking about it, Tubbo agrees to join Karl\u2019s karaoke stream tomorrow.\n\u201cI\u2019ve fucked up,\u201d Tubbo tells his bandmates.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tommy asks. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI agreed to do Karl\u2019s karaoke stream tonight,\u201d Tubbo honestly can\u2019t believe he did that. \u201cAnd I would feel terrible if I backed out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Karl\u2019s karaoke stream?\u201d Ranboo asks, confused.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange, innit?\u201d Tommy says. \u201cThat our good friend Tubbo sounds a lot like the lead singer from that one band. What was it? The Multiplayers. Yeh, Tubbo sure does sound like Player One, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Tubbo groans. On screen, Tubbo sees Ranboo go pale. \u201cWilbur already mentioned once that I sound like\u2026 myself?\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Tommy nods. Tubbo groans, dropping his head dramatically into his hands. \u201cIs Wilbur going to be part of the karaoke stream, too?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Tubbo says. \u201cWith Sapnap and Dream and George. Probably a few others.\u201d\n\u201cWell, fuck,\u201d Tommy says. \u201cI suppose you could just cancel.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve already agreed!\u201d Tubbo laments. The stream is going to be starting soon, too. He\u2019d sort of forgotten about it entirely until he\u2019d gotten a message from Karl reminding him of when he would be starting the stream.\n\u201cUh, yeah. Guys?\u201d Ranboo bites his lip. Tubbo notices for the first time that Ranboo hasn\u2019t been part of this conversation save for his initial question. \u201cWe may have a problem.\u201d\n\u201cAnother one?\u201d Tubbo throws his hands into the air.\nRanboo rubs the back of his neck. \u201cHeh, uh. I may or may not have also agreed to do the karaoke stream?\u201d\u00a0\n...\nTubbo tells Karl he\u2019s feeling ill. Ranboo, however, joins the stream. They were worried about it being suspicious if they  both  cancelled on Karl. Thankfully, Ranboo isn\u2019t the  lead singer  of a band currently growing substantially in popularity. While he  does sing on their tracks, his voice will, hopefully, not be quite as recognizable as Tubbo\u2019s. So there, problem solved.\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Karl had told Tubbo when he\u2019d broken the news. \u201cGet well soon! You can be part of my next karaoke stream.\u201d\n\u201cRight, yes. I will absolutely be there next time,\u201d okay so maybe their problems aren\u2019t actually solved. Oops. Listen, Tubbo panicked. He doesn\u2019t want to be mean and say  no. He already feels bad enough about cancelling  this time.\nBut he tells Karl he\u2019s ill and then pulls the stream up a few minutes later so he can watch it. He uses an alt account, one that nobody knows of.\u00a0\nWilbur  is there, as well as the Dream Team, Bad, Quackity, and of course, Ranboo. Karl has already gone through the usual ritual of welcoming chat and now he, Quackity, and Sapnap are singing a song that Tubbo hasn\u2019t heard before.\u00a0\nTubbo sets about editing the new episode for The Let\u2019s Play Channel while keeping an ear on the stream. It\u2019s about a half-hour in when Tubbo hears someone mention The Multiplayers. He focuses back on the stream only to find that  Dream  was the one who mentioned the band.  Dream? God, their following is going to grow even more now, and it\u2019s going to be harder and harder to keep their identities secret.\u00a0\n\u201c-heard of them?\u201d the man is saying. Everybody in the call, as it turns out, has heard of The Multiplayers. What the fuck? Have The Multiplayers become some sort of  thing within the Minecraft YouTuber community?\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s do both of their songs!\u201d Karl says, clapping his hands together in excitement.\u00a0\n\u201cI learned them both on guitar, actually,\u201d Wilbur tells them.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Wilbur, you can play them for us while we sing!\u201d Bad says.\n\u201cWait really?\u201d Ranboo chokes. \u201cWe\u2019re singing The Multiplayers?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, man, they\u2019re good,\u201d Quackity says.\n\u201cUh, right.\u201d\nTubbo\u2019s Discord pings with two messages from Ranboo.\nRanbooHELPAre you watching the stream?\nTubboYesIdk how ot help thoSay you have strep throat\nRanbooWtfThat\u2019s not helpfulI was just singingWhat do i do??????\nTubboYou got this big man!!;)\nRanbooTUBBO\nWilbur starts playing \u201cMasked\u201d first. It sounds much different, considering he\u2019s only using an acoustic guitar, but it\u2019s kind of crazy that Wilbur even learned how to play it in the first place.\u00a0\nEverybody launches into song at once. With everyone singing, and not everyone hitting the proper notes, it sounds\u2026 not the best. Thankfully, it masks Ranboo\u2019s voice quite a bit. Tubbo also notices that Ranboo is only actually singing the parts of the song that he  doesn\u2019t sing backing vocals for in their recording. That\u2019s smart-thinking on Ranboo\u2019s part. People probably won\u2019t even realize he sounds a lot like Player Two. People won\u2019t even think to wonder about it.\u00a0\nThey finish the song with\u2026 flair. They\u2019re all laughing, though, including Ranboo (thank god). They\u2019re clearly having a lot of fun. It continues into their rendition of \u201cLost and Losing\u201d.\u00a0\nOverall, Tubbo thinks the karaoke stream goes really well. And yes, even when George joked, \u201cWow, Ranboo. You\u2019re not bad. You should be a singer,\u201d and Tubbo just  knows that Ranboo didn\u2019t know whether to panic or to laugh.\u00a0\nNow all Tubbo has to do is make sure that the next karaoke stream he accidentally agreed to join goes just as well.\u00a0\n...\nNobody knows that Tubbo is in a band except for, well,  the band.\u00a0\nAnd his family.\u00a0\nAnd his bandmates\u2019 families, too, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now.\nWhat  is  important is the fact that one of his sisters just asked him to cover a song. It\u2019s a good song, but it might take some work because Tubbo knows for a  fact that even if they mess with keys and octaves, he doesn\u2019t have the vocal range that the original band has. They\u2019ll have to adjust some things, but when Tubbo brings it up with the others they\u2019re both on board. Tommy does make some jokes about Tubbo being wrapped around his sister\u2019s finger, though.\u00a0\n\u201cTold You So\u201d gets uploaded to The Multiplayers\u2019 YouTube channel and it quickly becomes one of their most popular covers.\u00a0\n 4971 Comments \nLara ClarenDidn\u2019t know I needed a Little Mix cover by The Multiplayers until today omg\nBassBoy9Wow, piano in this song sounds so good!\u00a0\nMaia QI agree! I\u2019m glad they added it!\u00a0\nSalted Chocolate ChipOh i feel like i\u2019m being given a warm hug when I listen to this! Thank you for introducing me to Little Mix btw\nPh1LzA \u2713Great cover!\nWhile it\u2019s one of their most popular, the Little Mix cover is also the first time they get an abundance of hate. Sure, people have left mean comments before, but it\u2019s not until they cover a song by a girl group that things turn particularly nasty. The only other time they got comments like that was under their Taylor Swift cover. Apparently, men aren\u2019t allowed to enjoy music sung by women? It\u2019s stupid, Tubbo thinks. Thankfully, all of the sexist and homophobic comments get buried under positive ones.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cYou guys are never going to believe what I have to show you,\u201d Ranboo says one day. Tubbo has just finished streaming and now they\u2019re all going to work a little more on Ranboo\u2019s second original song. It\u2019s looking like the song is going to involve a lot more synth than the other originals they\u2019ve made, so the three of them have been testing out sounds recently.\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2026 what is it?\u201d Tubbo asks tentatively. In their Discord call, Ranboo starts screen sharing. His web browser is opened to YouTube with a video called \u201cGood Kid - Dream SMP Animatic\u201d pulled up and ready to be played. Tubbo watches as Ranboo full-screens the video and hits play.\u00a0\nThe animatic is good, but Tubbo knows that\u2019s not the only reason that Ranboo is showing them this. The focus of the animatic is dsmp!Tommy, at the beginning of the exile arc, singing \u201cGood Kid\u201d. But the artist didn\u2019t use the original cast recording of the song. They used  The Multiplayers\u2019 version.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, holy shit,\u201d Tommy says, awed.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is so cool,\u201d Tubbo watches intently. It\u2019s an emotional animatic and he gets sucked right into the story. It probably helps that it\u2019s actually Tommy singing, so his drawn character sounds just like-\n-Oh.\u00a0\nThis explains the random upsurge in \u201cTommy is Player Three\u201d rumours that Tubbo has been seeing recently. Is Tommy\u2019s secret identity in jeopardy? Or will people (hopefully) continue to think it\u2019s just a funny rumour or an \u2018it would be pretty cool if\u2019? No matter how hard they tried, there were still some comments after the karaoke stream about Ranboo sounding like Player Two.\u00a0\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Tommy says when the animatic has ended. \u201cI\u2019m sending that to Wilbur.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWait!\u201d Tubbo says. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTubbo\u2019s right,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cWilbur knows you. Your voice, paired with an animatic of you? It would be-\u201d\n\u201cReally obvious,\u201d Tubbo finishes.\nTommy sighs, \u201cDamn.\u201d\nRanboo, of course, is the strongest advocate for keeping their identities secret, and while it may seem like Tubbo is the second-most fervent supporter of the idea, that role belongs to TommyInnit.\nTommy likes to make jokes about getting subs and follows and views and, like, recognition or whatever, but Tubbo  knows  him. Tommy hasn\u2019t explicitly said it before, but Tubbo knows that Tommy\u2019s a little bit scared of everybody finding out he\u2019s part of The Multiplayers. In fact, Tommy might actually be a little bit embarrassed. Not of the band! And not of their songs, either! But his singing, his playing, those are things that can be picked apart and used to target Tommy specifically. And  that is what\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\nTubbo understands. He feels the same way sometimes.\u00a0\n...\nThey start getting crossover fanart. Tubbo is almost always drawn as Player One, which,  thanks a lot, Wilbur. Tommy is often drawn as Player Three, rocking out on his drums and generally having the time of his life. Player Two seems to fluctuate the most. Now that people headcanon Tubbo and Tommy in a band, they just chose random Dream SMP members to fill the other role.\u00a0\nStill, Ranboo is Player Two a lot. That headcanon is, of course, attributed to the karaoke stream. Player Two is also sometimes Jack, because Jack can sing, and Eret, because of their deep voice. There also seem to be quite a few Niki!P2 headcanons.\u00a0\n\u201cLook at this one!\u201d\nThe fanart that Tubbo has sent is SBI as The Multiplayers. Phil is Player One, Techno is Player Two, Tommy is Player Three, and Wilbur is a player that the artist made up themself, Player Four.\n\u201cNice, I saw that one,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cHave you seen this one?\u201d\nThe art Ranboo found has Dream as Player One, George as Player Two, and Sapnap as Player Three.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Tommy has joined the call, it would seem. Ranboo bursts out laughing.\n\u201cHey Tommy,\u201d Tubbo greets his friend.\n\u201cTubso.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, are we ready to practice the song?\u201d Ranboo asks, grabbing his guitar from off-camera.\u00a0\n\u201cUm, actually,\u201d Tommy says. \u201cI think you boys should go watch my VOD.\u201d\n\u201cTommy,\u201d Ranboo teases.\n\u201cNo, seriously. Just- just near the end,\u201d Okay\u2026 Tommy sounds nervous. That\u2019s never good.\n\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Tubbo questions. He\u2019s suddenly  very worried.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, yeh,\u201d Tommy says, looking directly into his camera. \u201cTechnoblade happened.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s really not as bad as you implied it would be,\u201d Ranboo says when Tommy pauses the VOD.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tommy gasps, voice raised enough that Tubbo turns down his volume a little bit. \u201cRanboo this is\u2026 this is-\u201d\n\u201cFucking hilarious!\u201d Tubbo doubles over laughing, disappearing from the view of his camera almost entirely.\u00a0\nTommy gasps again, more dramatically this time. \u201cI feel so  betrayed  . How do you not see how  awful this is?\u201d he whines.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like your cover is blown,\u201d Tubbo points out, trying to regain his composure. \u201cYou just-\u201d\n\u201cI just got  my own song  explained to me by  Technoblade, Tubbo!\u201d he groans, running his hands through his hair and thoroughly messing it up. \u201cSeriously, what the fuck? And I had to act normal!\u201d\nThe stream had been another SBI Terraria stream. Near the end, Wilbur had given up on actually playing and had busted out his guitar. That led to Phil mentioning how Wilbur had learnt both of The Multiplayers\u2019 songs for Karl\u2019s karaoke stream.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you listen to The Multiplayers like I told you to, Technoblade?\u201d Wilbur had asked.\u00a0\nTechnoblade hummed. \u201cI was surprised at how good their songs are lyrically.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tommy had asked. To anyone else, it would seem like Tommy had simply been curious, but his bandmates knew he was rather thrilled to have someone say that.\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Like \u2018Masked\u2019 is-\u201d\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d Tommy interrupted then, and this was the moment that made Tubbo facepalm; \u201cMurder.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLike, seriously, Tommy. You wrote that. It\u2019s your song. \n\n\u201cEh- it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Technoblade had said. From there, Techno and Wilbur got into a long conversation about the metaphors and storytelling in \u201cMasked\u201d. They also spoke about \u201cLost and Losing\u201d but that\u2019s clearly not what Tommy is currently focused on.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d Techno had ended with. Wilbur had responded, same with Phil, but when Tommy didn\u2019t, Techno prompted, \u201cTommy? Get it?\u201d\nAnd Tommy, having been panicking for the last ten minutes because of that entire conversation and having thus missed the conversation entirely, had blurted, \u201cRight, yes. Very- very metaphorical,\u201d like an idiot.\u00a0\nAnd now Tommy had terrified Tubbo and Ranboo into thinking there was a full-blown crisis, when in reality, \u201cYou barely even embarrassed yourself, big man.\u201d\n\u201cTubbo! That was the longest ten-odd minutes of my life! That was- that was-  Technoblade, he-\u201d\n\u201cHe went all  English major  on you, man,\u201d Ranboo cackles.\u00a0\n...\nThey did eventually get around to practicing Ranboo\u2019s second original song that night. Now, a couple days later, Tubbo is sitting at his desk in a call with the others, preparing to upload it. They had intended to upload it two days ago but the artist they had commissioned to make the cover image needed a little bit more time. It was well worth it, though. The cover looks amazing!\u00a0\nThe song is really amazing, too. It\u2019s a full-on pop song, which Tubbo is still sort of surprised came from Ranboo. This kind of pop is something Tubbo listens to more than anyone else in the band. But, \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d is a pop song.\u00a0\nInstrumentally, it\u2019s heaviest on the guitar and synth, though it does have an intro and an outro solely played on the piano. Tommy\u2019s drums help keep the rhythm in a way that makes the song very obviously pop: it\u2019s easy to dance to. And, despite having been written by their bassist, the bass isn\u2019t all that prominent, not like it is in \u201cMasked\u201d, at least. The bass part  is rather complicated, though, according to Ranboo.\nTubbo figures most people would classify \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d as a \u2018bop\u2019, and it is, but it\u2019s also got  layers  . He supposes it could be an  angry bop. It sounds upbeat, especially for what\u2019s basically a breakup song. Still, the song exposes some of Ranboo\u2019s insecurities. The chorus, especially, highlights that.\n\n Are you content\n\nWithin this knockoff love?\n\nBuilt on inconsistencies,\n\nOn false niceties\n\nthat you gave me?\n\nAre you lying\n\nwhen you tell me\n\nThat you want to know\n\nThe real me?\n\nOr is that just another\n\nFalse nicety?\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not just about a romantic relationship that feels fake, it\u2019s about any relationship that feels fake. Even more, it\u2019s about not actually knowing whether a relationship is real. Not being able to tell.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure you want to share this one, Ranboo?\u201d Tommy asks out of the blue.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Ranboo questions, genuinely confused.\u00a0\nTubbo sits forward in his chair, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a very personal song.\u201d\n\u201cI just-\u201d Tommy runs a hand through his hair, \u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re\u2026 comfortable with putting that out there.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like people are going to know that I wrote it,\u201d Ranboo says. The silence that falls is solemn, nearly suffocating.\u00a0\n\u201cIt-\u201d Tubbo takes a deep breath then quietly queries, \u201cWe all know it won\u2019t last forever. The secrecy, I mean. Right? Someday-\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cI know.\u201d\n...\nNew Band \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 Randomly Growing In Popularity Amongst the Minecraft YouTube Community\u00a0\n'The Multiplayers\u2019, originally a cover band, have become popular amongst Minecraft YouTubers, especially those within the Dream SMP community.\u00a0\nby Claire Han\nRead more\nCheck Out \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 on YouTube: The New Band That Hides Their Faces\nBeginning as a cover band, \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 now have three original songs and a massive following that just keeps on growing - and it\u2019s totally deserved.\u00a0\nby Evan Diaz\nRead mor\nPlayers One Through Three: \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 Band Gets Big on YouTube and TikTok\nA new band called \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 has wooed their audience with amazing vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keys/synth.\u00a0\nby Jamie Gonzalez\nRead more\nWhy Are \u2018The Multiplayers\u2019 So Popular?: A Look Into the Popularity of Secret Identities\nFrom Daft Punk to Pussy Riot, and from Dream to Corpse, keeping their identities secret has been important for artists and content creators for a variety of reasons.

Glad you could make it this time!\u201d Karl says.\u00a0\n\u201cHi Karl, hi chat,\u201d Tubbo replies enthusiastically. Or, as enthusiastically as he can considering he\u2019s terrified. Why he agreed to do another karaoke stream is beyond him.\u00a0\nSome of the others in the call greet Tubbo while they wait for everybody else to show up. Dream, Sapnap and Quackity are already there and a minute or so later, Bad and Wilbur show up. That\u2019s apparently everyone for tonight, so they get right into it.\u00a0\nTubbo manages to avoid singing for the first twenty minutes of the stream, letting the others go through their song choices. But then Wilbur asks Tubbo if he wants to do a Hamilton song, like they had in a previous karaoke stream, and Tubbo figures, why not? The style of songs found in Hamilton are different from the types of songs The Multiplayers do. It\u2019ll be fine.\nAnd it  is  fine. It goes surprisingly well. Nobody even  mentions the Multiplayers (Tubbo has the stream pulled up on his other monitor so he can watch the chat).\u00a0\n\u201cHey Wilbur,\u201d Karl says when the song ends, \u201chave you learned \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d yet?\u201d\n\u201cOn the guitar? Almost. I could probably figure it out now.\u201d\nOh no. Seriously? The Multiplayers really  have  become a thing in the mcyt community. How did this even happen?  Wilbur. Well, Wilbur\u2019s media share.\u00a0\nThinking about it, though, Tubbo has no idea how the Dream Team found The Multiplayers. And how did Karl find them? Quackity? He heard Puffy talking about them too. And Eret. Fuck, even non-dsmp Minecraft YouTubers have mentioned the Multiplayers!\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Quackity exclaims.\u00a0\nTubbo has about five seconds to decide what to do. He has two options. He can sing, which would risk revealing his secret identity as Player One.  Or  , he could not sing, which would be just as incriminating. He would be so obviously avoiding it, plus his friends would get suspicious or worried, which might bring even  more attention to the fact that he wasn\u2019t singing.\u00a0\nHe goes with option three: singing, but doing an absolute  shit job of it.\u00a0\nHe sings half-heartedly at best and pushes away from his desk a little so that his mic has a harder time picking him up. It seems to work. Mostly. Wilbur, when they\u2019ve finished the song, still says, \u201cTubbo, you really do sound like Player One.\u201d\u00a0\nThat fucker.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, he does,\u201d Dream says. Tubbo tenses, biting his lip. Could his friends just shut up for a second?\u00a0\n\u201cAwe, thank you,\u201d Tubbo says, trying to play it off.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you play piano, too, right?\u201d Sapnap asks. Goddammit.\u00a0\nLaughing nervously, Tubbo confirms that yes, he does play the piano. \u201cBut I\u2019ve no idea how to use a synth, much less how to  write music,\u201d he lies. Thankfully, the others drop it. They move on, with Karl and Quackity singing some Taylor Swift song from like, 2013 or something.\u00a0\nAnd things are fine. Tubbo chills, fading into the background of the stream a little bit.  Tubbo Player One trends on Twitter for an hour, though.\u00a0\nAfter the stream, Sapnap messages him, which is kind of unexpected.\nSapnap\nHey man\nYou good?\nYou were kind of quiet when we did false niceties\nAnd after that too\nTubbo\nI\u2019m fine!\nJust tired!\nSapnap\nYou sure?\nTubbo\nYeah!\nI just\nDon\u2019t like the multiplayers that much\nThey\u2019re okay\nbut\nWell, now Tubbo is digging a hole for himself. God, he\u2019s as bad as Tommy.\u00a0\nSapnap\nYou don\u2019t like the mutliplaeyrs???\u00a0\nTubbo\nBro\nTubbo\nI don\u2019t disliek them\nI just don\u2019t\nLike\nThem\nU know?\nSapnap\nI guess\nAs long as ur doing okay\nTubbo\nNever been better\n...\nHaving now released Ranboo\u2019s second song, The Multiplayers only have Tubbo\u2019s original song to put out. It still needs work so they do some more covers.\u00a0\nThe first cover is one that people have been requesting a lot; \u201cNow or Never\u201d from the Netflix show  Julie and the Phantoms. The request is probably so popular because it\u2019s performed by the band  Sunset Curve in the show, which is a group of four boys (never mind that there are only three Multiplayers).\u00a0\nBefore they do \u201cNow or Never\u201d though, they play a little trick on their audience. They tell everyone that they\u2019ll be doing a  Julie and the Phantoms cover, and while everyone expects \u201cNow or Never\u201d they, instead, perform \u201cAll Eyes on Me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n I keep the party going all night, all night\n\nI set the trends that you all like, all like\n\nI make an entrance when I don't try, don't try\n\n'Cause all I see is all eyes on me\n\nI only lead, I never follow, follow\n\nI never open 'cause it's my show, my show\n\nDon't know if people think I'm shallow, shallow\n\nBut all I see is all eyes on me\n\nThey do it because it\u2019s  hilarious. None of them had watched  Julie and the Phantoms before, so none of them had known any of the songs. After people kept requesting \u201cNow or Never\u201d they\u2019d all gone and watched the show (the episodes aren\u2019t that long, it\u2019s bingeable). After hearing \u201cAll Eyes on Me\u201d, Tubbo had messaged their group chat.\nTubbo\nGuys.\nWe have to do All Eyes on Me\nPlease\nTommy\nWtf\nwhy??\nTubbo\nWe\u2019re a faceless band\nThere are no eyes on us\nNone\nIt\u2019ll be funny\nRanboo\nAhahahaha\nLet\u2019s do it\nThey do release \u201cNow or Never\u201d two days later, but it\u2019s hilarious to see the reactions they get from \u201cAll Eyes on Me\u201d.\u00a0\n...\nNick Halden | @NotCaffrey\nOkay but can people be more respectful of  @TheMultiplayers  privacy maybe? There\u2019s probably a good reason they don\u2019t want to show their faces...\nPreSerum Steve | @N_Leeds\nSeconding this! Also has everyone forgotten the \u2018not very [old]\u2019 tweet? Stop making gross comments please?\n\u00a0\nClark | @NopeGoAway\nAll you @TheMultiplayers fans are stupid. How do you know they\u2019re good people?? You have no idea what they look like, you don\u2019t know anything about them other than they make okay music.\nTara | @Tara_K\nThere are other artists out there that we don\u2019t know a lot about\u2026\u00a0\nI guess | @LoveTheMultiplayers\nHow do you know they\u2019re /not/ good? Your argument can be made both ways motherfucker\nKath | @WOOoo_\nTheir music is better than \u2018okay\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYep | @Hen118\nI love mcyt as much as the next person but maybe we should stop comparing The Multiplayers to Tommy and Tubbo and everyone\nYep | @Hen118\nI mean, the art is cool but it\u2019s just for fun. We shouldn\u2019t take the conspiracies seriously. I don\u2019t mind making headcanons and art and stories but don\u2019t harass The Multiplayers and all of the content creators about it, you know?\u00a0\nYep | @Hen118\nAnd if the mcyts actually are The Multiplayers then they shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to reveal their secret identities.\nYep | @Hen118\nAnd if they aren\u2019t, then it seems a bit disrespectful to The Multiplayers to only like them because you\u2019re assuming they\u2019re some random minecraft youtuber you like.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTommyInnit | @tommyinnit\nWhy do people keep asking me about drums?\n\nGot My Band and a Light That Won\u2019t Go Out: An Interlude in Three Parts\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Dream Team Interlude:\n\n\nOkay so Sapnap is sort of worried about the kid. \u2018The kid\u2019 being Tubbo. It started during the karaoke stream. Tubbo had gone all quiet after they\u2019d started singing \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d. But now, looking back, Sapnap knows that something has been up for a long time.\nFirst of all, Tubbo doesn\u2019t stream nearly as often as he used to. Seriously, there was a point when Tubbo would stream pretty much every day. And he\u2019d go on other people\u2019s streams after his own! Now, he misses a day here and there with no explanation.\u00a0\nTubbo also seems to be more tired than usual. Sapnap doesn\u2019t always manage to catch the kid\u2019s streams live, but Twitter is usually filled with screenshots and clips afterwards and  damn. That kid is often sporting some serious bags under his eyes.\u00a0\nAnd then there\u2019s The Multiplayers drama. Okay, it\u2019s probably stretching it to call it drama. People are sort of just going around assuming that Tubbo, and Tommy and Ranboo, are in a band together. Sapnap actually thought it was funny and kind of cool. And the art is great, too.\u00a0\nBut then Tubbo told Sapnap that he doesn\u2019t really like The Multiplayers all that much and well\u2026 Sapnap can guess what that means. Tubbo is sick of constantly getting harassed about a band that he doesn\u2019t actually have any connection to.\u00a0\nAnd now Sapnap has brought it up with the  worst tact. On George\u2019s stream. Because Sapnap is an idiot who is currently kicking himself to the fucking moon.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? Tubbo doesn\u2019t like The Multiplayers?\u201d Dream gasps, because  of course  Dream is here too. George is currently speedrunning alone with Dream and Sapnap on call with him. \u201cThey make the  exact kind of music that he and Tommy like.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh no no no no!\u201d George screeches as a ghast nearly fireballs him into lava. Meanwhile, chat is going wild with the news that Tubbo doesn\u2019t like The Multiplayers, which Sapnap really didn\u2019t mean to let slip in front of thousands of people. It looks like a lot of people feel betrayed, which is kind of dumb because Tubbo isn\u2019t  actually Player One.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sapnap says. \u201cHe\u2019s allowed to have his own opinions.\u201d\nDream must catch on to the fact that Sapnap is trying to change the subject because he immediately starts teasing George for taking so long to get blaze rods.\u00a0\n...\nGreen Cat | @wotlen\u00a0@TubboLive doesn\u2019t like @TheMultiplayers ????? What is this???? WHY?\nKath | @WOOoo_I\u2019m honestly kind of not surprised? If you watch some of his recent streams he goes all quiet whenever donos ask him about being part of the band. I think he\u2019s sick of people always asking about it.\n\u00a0\nYep | @Hen118Leave @TubboLive alone. He\u2019s allowed to not like things\n\u00a0\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayersLove you, too @TubboLive -P1\u00a0\nCongrats it\u2019s a demigod | @Steph47oh my god\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sl\neepy Bois Interlude:\n\n\nIs Wilbur maybe a little bit worried about Tommy? No. He\u2019s definitely quite a lot worried about Tommy.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Phil tells him. They\u2019re in a call together, with Techno as well, none of them streaming. Wilbur has The Multiplayers\u2019 latest cover, \u201cGrow Up\u201d by Paramore, playing in the background. It\u2019s a damn good cover.\u00a0\nTechno hums. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s been acting weird lately.\u201d\u00a0\nWeird is an understatement. Tommy has definitely fucked up his sleep schedule again. He\u2019s also been really busy lately, which is strange considering Wilbur knows when Tommy streams and he knows when Tommy is filming a video because Wilbur is always there to film it with him. And while college might keep Tommy a little busy, it\u2019s never been  this bad.\u00a0\nAll of which is to say; Tommy is hiding something. And okay, fine, maybe Wilbur should give him his privacy, but he\u2019s  worried. He feels like Tommy has been pulling away from him. Did Wilbur overstep somehow? Too many \u2018brothers\u2019 jokes? No, Tommy makes those jokes too. So what is it?\n\u201cI noticed he\u2019s been spending a lot more time with Ranboo and Tubbo,\u201d Phil says.\u00a0\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem abnormal,\u201d Techno points out.\n\u201cNo, I mean all of them together at all hours of the day,\u201d Phil explains. \u201cTommy has mentioned it once or twice but he always gets jumpy when I ask what they\u2019re up to.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just making a video together?\u201d Technoblade suggests.\n\u201cFor several months?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a series?\u201d Technoblade is grasping at straws and Wilbur can tell that he knows it. \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just, you know, being  friends.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that makes more sense,\u201d Phil agrees. \u201cStill, I\u2019ve noticed similar behaviour in Ranboo and Tubbo.\u201d\nWilbur sighs, running a hand through his hair to get it out of his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, this started about when that band started getting big,\u201d Techno says.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? The Multiplayers?\u201d Wilbur asks. What would The Multiplayers have to do with this?\u00a0\n\u201cD\u2019you think they\u2019re being weird because of all those conspiracies?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I think it would be weird for people to assume I was in a band that I have nothing to do with,\u201d Techno says. \u201cSo maybe they\u2019re just weirded out and taking some time?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Wilbur says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like them. Wouldn\u2019t they just address it? Why  haven\u2019t they addressed it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe because Tubbo has some weird Twitter beef with them?\u201d Philza guesses. \u201cHe and Player One have been tweeting at each other nonstop for the past couple of days.\u201d\u00a0\n That  had certainly been a strange development. It seems to have convinced a few people that Tubbo isn\u2019t actually Player One (which is strange because couldn\u2019t someone tweet at themself from two different accounts? It would be weird, sure, but they  could). Wilbur hasn\u2019t actually seen any of their exchanges, what with not using Twitter anymore, but Phil, Tommy, and Tubbo himself have kept him well up-to-date with it all.\u00a0\nThe call is quiet for a second before Phil says, \u201cOh. Wow.\u201d\n\u201cWow?\u201d Techno inquires.\n\u201cThat band. The Multiplayers. They\u2019ve been  signed.\u201d\u00a0\n...\n\n\nThe TommyInnit Interlude:\n\n\nTommy has been prepared for this record deal.\u00a0\nThey get contacted one morning through Twitter by a well-known record label. The label wants to set up a virtual meeting to discuss\u2026 important things with the band. While the rest of the band freaks out because they have no idea what they\u2019re meant to do, Tommy contacts the lawyer he set up for them months ago.\u00a0\nWhen it had looked like their original songs were really doing well, Tommy had contacted a lawyer, just in case. Now, he\u2019s glad he did. He doesn\u2019t want the band getting screwed over by a record label and Ms. Erica Asante will stop at nothing to make sure they get a fair deal.\u00a0\nAfter several meetings, The Multiplayers come away with a record deal, full artistic control over their music, sound, and image, and the guarantee that the label won\u2019t reveal their identities until they\u2019re ready. Thank you, Ms. Asante, for realizing that non-disclosure agreements might be a good idea.\u00a0\nNow, The Multiplayers get to make an  actual  EP! All three of the original songs they have out now will be on it, plus Tubbo\u2019s original (once it\u2019s finished) and two  more originals!\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve also got access to real recording studios, now. The label has studios in London, New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto. It sucks that they can\u2019t all be in the same studio together right now but the fact that they can even be in a studio at all is amazing.\u00a0\nTo top it all off, if their first EP does well, the label will let The Multiplayers make a full album. When they\u2019d first started the band, Tommy  never  thought it would become this\u2026  big. He also didn\u2019t expect for the band to become so important to the three of them. Yet, here he is. Here they  all are. Together.\u00a0\nNow they just have to figure out how to balance streaming, making videos, school, and creating an EP. Oh. Sleeping and eating should probably go in that list somewhere, too.\u00a0\nThe first thing they do after getting signed is release another cover. Instead of pressuring themselves to do everything at once, they pull out their instruments and record a cover of Bo Burnham\u2019s \u201cChannel 5 News: The Musical\u201d. Tubbo sings the opening of the song, Tommy sings the part of Chip Walker, and Ranboo finishes it off as the part of Max Stevens.\u00a0\nSo yeah, they spend time working on the cover. And school. And streaming. They can worry about finishing Tubbo\u2019s original song and writing two more songs later because right now, all they need to worry about is-\nWilbur?\nTubbo stops scrolling through the comments on \u201cChannel 5 News: The Musical\u201d. Someone has mentioned Wilbur in their comment. It isn\u2019t unusual to see his name - or the names of any of their fellow Minecraft YouTubers - in The Multiplayers\u2019 comments. What is unusual is the fact that the comment has a  lot of likes and replies.\u00a0\nSalted Chocolate Chip\nOk but, consider\u2026 The Multiplayers covering a Wilbur song?\nScrolling further, Tubbo finds that there are several comments about Wilbur, ranging from The Multiplayers covering his songs to actually making a whole new song with him.\u00a0\nAnd well, thinking about it, Tubbo has to admit; it  would be pretty cool.\u00a0\n...\nTubbo is currently having the time of his life. He\u2019s got his @TubboLive Twitter open on his phone and @TheMultiplayers in an incognito window on his laptop. He may or may not have plans to turn this rivalry into an epic romance. When he\u2019d told the others about it, Ranboo had sighed and said, \u201cOf course you would start a slow burn, enemies-to-lovers Twitter relationship with yourself.\u201d\u00a0\nWhatever that means\u2026\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just a lot of fun, is all, and it seems to be dispelling some of the rumours that Tubbo and Player One are one and the same. Which is hilarious, considering Tubbo is, in fact, himself. It also helps distract him when he gets too overwhelmed. Juggling everything in his life is proving to be more difficult than he expected it to be.\u00a0\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayers\nCooking stream? @TubboLive you can\u2019t cook -P1\nTubbo | @TubboLive\nExcuse you!!! Yes I can. Let me come over i\u2019ll cook for you\nTommyInnit | @tommyinnit\nYeah Tubbo you tell him\nTubbo | @TubboLive\nHmm\n\u201cTubbo, seriously. What are you doing?\u201d Ranboo asks in a Discord call a few minutes later.\n\u201cI told you-\u201d\n\u201cEnemies to lovers,\u201d Ranboo deadpans. Sighing, he adds, \u201cDo you know when Tommy said he\u2019d be here?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he has homework to do,\u201d Tubbo says at the exact same moment that Tommy joins the call.\u00a0\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Tommy blurts before anybody can greet him.\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d Tubbo inquires, only partially paying attention as he taps something out on his laptop.\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayers\nMaybe I will invite you over. What are we having? -P1\n\u201cYeah. For another cover, if you\u2019re feeling up to it.\u201d\nTubbo | @TubboLive\n...\nI can make pancakes?\n\u201cWhat song?\u201d Ranboo asks.\nCongrats it\u2019s a demigod | @Steph47\nLiterally what is happening with Player One and Tubbo????\nCurrently Losing It | @TamFox\nTubbo_ whispers to you: this is deffo flerting\n\u2018Success\u2019 Tubbo thinks as he reads the replies to his tweet. This is so fucking fun. Then Tommy says, \u201cYour New Boyfriend,\u201d and Tubbo nearly drops his phone.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ranboo exclaims.\n\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d Tubbo shouts.\u00a0\n\u201cHear me out,\u201d Tommy responds calmly. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t sing it. I\u2019ve done that too many times on stream.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t sing it either,\u201d Tubbo says, thinking about the  several times that Wilbur has pointed out his similarities to Player One. \u201cThat\u2019ll bring too much of the wrong kind of attention.\u201d\nTommy hums, contemplative. \u201cBut what if...\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ranboo says softly, almost a whisper. He takes a long, shuddering breath. \u201cYeah, what if I sang it?\u201d\n...\nThe first time that Player Two is credited as \u2018lead vocals\u2019 alongside his usual \u2018bassist and guitarist\u2019, he ends up trending on Twitter. The small clip of it is The Multiplayers\u2019 most viewed video on TikTok. Wilbur Soot comments \u201cWell done!\u201d on the YouTube video.\u00a0\nAfter the amazing reception they get from \u201cYour New Boyfriend\u201d, Ranboo is more confident in his singing. Not that he hadn\u2019t been before, but considering he\u2019d only really done backing vocals for most of their songs, or at least shared in singing lead, he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever be ready to sing lead on his own.\nTubbo is glad that Ranboo finally feels comfortable enough to sing lead sometimes. He has a good voice.\u00a0\nThe next cover Ranboo suggests is from a musical. \u201cTwo Player Game\u201d from  Be More Chill. Ranboo and Tubbo both sing for Michael while Tommy sings the part of Jeremy. Ranboo has a lot of fun when Tommy sings \u201cYou know that you are my favourite person\u201d and he gets to poke fun when he sings back \u201cIs it really true? I\u2019m your favouwite person?\u201d\nThey do make one big change to the song, even though it messes with a rhyme here or there. Instead of \u201cTwo Player Game\u201d they sing it as \u201cThree Player Game\u201d.\u00a0\nTheir audience loves it. Especially because of the game theme that goes well with the theme the band has been rolling with since day one. And when they announce that their EP is going to have more original songs? The excitement that has been spreading throughout their fan base grows until it\u2019s almost overflowing. Tubbo can\u2019t imagine what\u2019ll happen when they actually release their full EP.\u00a0\n...\n\u201c-and then Ranboo you come in a few beats before us with that same strumming pattern you were using-\u201d\n\u201cThis one?\u201d Ranboo does it for a few seconds, though he slips up on a note for some reason.\n\u201cYeah, that one. And then I\u2019ll bring the ukulele back at the same time that Tommy-\u201d\nThe boy in question beats down on his drums far more aggressively than necessary.\n\u201c-does  that. And  then Ranboo, come back with the bass\u2026 Ranboo?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh,\u201d Ranboo swaps the guitar for his bass, playing a few notes.\n\u201cRight\u2026 and then-\u201d\n\u201cSorry, hold on,\u201d Ranboo sets his bass down again. Tubbo tilts his head to the side, showing his confusion. \u201cI just- I just checked Twitter-\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who\u2019s always telling us not to get distracted during practice?\u201d Tommy teases.\n\u201cYeah, I know but- Listen, a podcast dm\u2019d us. They want us to be in one of their episodes.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Tommy gasps. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Tubbo frowns. Their singing voices may be harder to recognize but their speaking voices? They basically speak for a living. He tells the others as much.\u00a0\n\u201cI was actually thinking about that,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cWhat if we mess with our microphone settings?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Like\u2026 use them as voice changers?\u201d Tubbo asks.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to start making music professionally, we\u2019re probably going to have to do interviews and stuff, right? We should figure it all out now when we aren\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201cWhen we aren\u2019t rich and famous?\u201d Tommy exclaims.\n\u201cNot exactly what I was going to say but yeah, that\u2019s the gist of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Tubbo says. Ranboo is right, they\u2019ll need to have some sort of presence, especially once they drop their EP. Starting out small, with a podcast, will help them out in the long run. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n...\nThey finally finish Tubbo\u2019s original song. Their fans had been getting antsy because it had been so long since \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d was released and because, after being signed, The Multiplayers promised a new song would be coming soon. Even Puffy had mentioned on stream once that she couldn\u2019t wait for The Multiplayers to release another song.\u00a0\nThis song ended up taking so long because they were finally able to use real studios to record and mix. It meant some travel time for all of them (safely, with masks and testing) but allowed Tommy and Tubbo to meet up at the London studio. The label had someone there to use the controls and such so all they really did was record, but it was still pretty cool.\nThe plan is to re-record their other originals for the EP some other time, probably when they go in to record their final two songs (which they haven\u2019t even started writing).\u00a0\nTubbo\u2019s song is more of a folk song, but with quite a bit of pop influence. Instead of using the keyboard, Tubbo\u2019s on his ukulele. He sings the first verse and pre-chorus\u00a0 on his own;\n When your days seem too long\n And you\u2019re lost in the throng\n And the masses of thousands of people,\n I\u2019ll be by your side\n With each turn of the tide\n Holding onto you, keeping you stable.\n If you\u2019re worried or scared\n That I\u2019ll leave you there\n All alone, with nowhere to go,\n Just know,\nThen the others come in for a rather grand chorus. Tubbo goes back to singing verse two and another pre-chorus on his own, then another chorus with everybody. Tommy sings the bridge. The last chorus is another group effort, but the outro goes back to just Tubbo, stripped back so only the ukulele is being played.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a song that Tubbo holds close to his heart because it\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s about his friends. It\u2019s for his friends, and especially for his band. He thinks they probably know that, even though he\u2019s never expressed it to them out loud. He hopes that they know that.\u00a0\n...\nTranscript from \u2018Chatting with Kara Kane and Spencer Khatri\u2019\nSeason Four, Episode 9\nFeaturing: The Multiplayers\n\nExcerpt:\n\nKara: Welcome! Why don\u2019t you go around and introduce yourselves? You can explain what you do in the band, while you\u2019re at it.\u00a0\nPlayer Two: Sure thing. Should we go in order?\nPlayer One: Probably. I\u2019m Player One. I\u2019m the lead singer and I play keys and synth. Oh, and the ukulele!\nSpencer: Yes! We heard that in your latest song, which is amazing, as usual, by the way.\u00a0\nPlayer One: Awe, thank you. That\u2019s the one I wrote, actually. I\u2019m also the one who mixes our songs, usually, although the others are often on call with me while I do it.\nSpencer: Wow. And for our listeners, the song we\u2019re talking about is \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d.\u00a0\nPlayer Two: Right, I guess it\u2019s my turn? I\u2019m Player Two. I play the bass, guitar and I do some backing vocals.\u00a0\nKara: And the song that you wrote is \u201cFalse Niceties\u201d, right?\u00a0\nPlayer Two: Oh, yeah. And \u201cLost and Losing\u201d\nPlayer Three:  And I\u2019m Player Three! I do  drums .\u00a0\nPlayer Two: He also does the majority of our backing vocals and some guitar\nPlayer Three: Yeah! An\u2019 I wrote \u201cMasked\u201d.\u00a0\nSpencer: So! I think we\u2019re just going to jump right into it! When\u2019s the EP coming out, boys?\nPlayer Two: Oh gosh, I don\u2019t think we have any idea.\u00a0\nKara: None at all?\nPlayer Three: We only just finished \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d so it\u2019ll probably be a while. We have other things going on in our lives. Outside of the band.\u00a0\nSpencer: Oh? Like?\nPlayer Two: Well, some of us have school.\nPlayer One: And other jobs.\u00a0\nKara: School? What are you studying? What years are you in?\nPlayer Three: I thought Americans called them grades.\nPlayer Two: I think she meant university? We\u2019re in high school.\u00a0\nPlayer Three: College for me!\nPlayer Two: Which is similar to what we call high school.\u00a0\nSpencer:  What? High school! Did you mean to share that? Should we cut it?\nPlayer Two: It\u2019s alright. We talked about what we would and wouldn\u2019t share before this!\nKara: Ah. That does remind me that I wanted to ask about how you met. And do you all live in the same place? You\u2019ve mentioned before that one of you is American and two of you are Brits?\u00a0\nPlayer One: Indeed. We all actually live in completely different places. We do everything through video calls and audio recordings.\u00a0\nPlayer Three: We met online. Quite a while ago, actually.\u00a0\nSpencer: Online? Wow, the powers of the internet.\u00a0\nPlayer Three: Ha! Yeh.\u00a0\nSpencer: So, why did you decide to go faceless? I figure a lot of high schoolers would probably want to be seen. Do you plan on ever revealing your faces?\nPlayer Two: Well, mostly, we wanted to keep our privacy.\u00a0\nPlayer One: We also wanted to make sure that people actually liked or disliked us solely because of our music, not because of how we look, how we dress, that sort of thing.\nPlayer Three: We\u2019ll probably reveal our faces at some point. Jus\u2019 not sure when.\nPlayer Two: Or how. It\u2019s nice not being seen. I prefer it to people constantly watching and following my every move. Although, Twitter sort of has that same effect anyway, so\u2026\nKara: Oh, yes! Twitter. Player One, can you explain the rivalry you\u2019ve got with the well-known Minecraft streamer and YouTuber \u2018Tubbo\u2019.\u00a0\nPlayer Three: Don\u2019t get him started!\nPlayer Two: Oh jeez-\nPlayer Two: [loud, playful sigh]\nPlayer One: Kara, Kara, am I ever glad that you asked.\n...\nInbox:\u00a0\nFrom: Carlos Avila - Euterpe Record and Music Group:    [email\u00a0protected]    \u00a0 \nTo:  The Multiplayers:    [email\u00a0protected]  \nThe Multiplayers,\nGood day! I am writing to inform you that we were recently contacted by Wilbur Soot about doing a song collaboration with you all. If you are interested, I will send his contact information so you can discuss with him directly the details of a collaboration. He has informed us that he has a song written but he is willing to sit down with you all and work on it, or write a new one, if it is not to your liking.\u00a0\nIf you are not interested, I will let him know.\nKeep up the good work,\nCarlos Avila\nKara and Spencer | @ChattingWithKSThank you again to @TheMultiplayers for being on the show! It was really great talking to you three!\nThe Multiplayers | @TheMultiplayers@ChattingWithKS Thanks for having us! -P2\n\u00a0\nPreSerum Steve | @N_Leeds@TheMultiplayers They\u2019re in high school????? THey really meant it when they said \u201cnot very old\u201d huh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProbably a Fan | @Tabitha_Riley\u00a0@TheMultiplayers \u201cAnd other jobs\u201d what other jobs?? Do you work at Subway or something? Other jobs? I-\nCurrently Losing It | @TamFoxLol that was so ominous. Player One mentioned it and then they just didn\u2019t talk about it.\n\u00a0\nMaya Dean | @M_ayaDeanOh my god I leave Twitter for barely even a month and when I show up again @TheMultiplayers have been signed and are putting out an EP? /pos\n\u00a0\nNick Halden | @NotCaffreyFor anyone wondering about the @TheMultiplayers interview on @ChattingWithKS they are using voice changers to keep their privacy.\nClark | @NopeGoAwayThat\u2019s dumb do they also change their voices when they sing too? They\u2019re so fake. Fuck @TheMultiplayers\n\u00a0\nTara  | @Tara_KI always thought that P1 and P3 were in one place together, and P2 was somewhere else, but they really are just all in separate places, huh? How do they do it??? Wow!!!!\n\u00a0\nWOODREAM | @Wiltered@TheMultiplayers met online? Friends for a while? Don\u2019t live in the same place? Other jobs??? Streamer!TheMultiplayers confirmed? /j\n\u00a0\nYep | @Hen118\u201cWe also wanted to make sure that people actually liked or disliked us solely because of our music, not because of how we look, how we dress, that sort of thing,\u201d (P1) Oh my god this is the sweetest!!! @TheMutliplayers on @ChattingWithKS\n\u00a0\nGreen Cat | @wotlen\u00a0I\u2019m really sorry I\u2019m genuinely confused\u2026 is Player One in love with Tubbo or something? Like obviously he\u2019s talking about a rivalry on the podcast but it sounds\u2026 idk how to explain, I\u2019m literally so confused?\u00a0\nCurrently Losing It | @TamFoxOh my god??? You\u2019re right? Tubbo did offer to make pancakes for Player One that one time\u2026\nKath | @WOOoo_Just a heads up for anyone speculating! Tubbo and Player One are both minors! Just keep that in mind is all I ask! Please don\u2019t be weird! I beg of you!\nI guess | @LoveTheMultiplayersSmart thinking @WOOoo_ That being said I\u2019m about to speculate: Remember when @tommyinnit said he could probably beat P2 in a fight and then P1 said he would definitely lose a fight to @TubboLive (\u00bd)\nI guess | @LoveTheMultiplayersAnd then Tubbo said \u201cYou would. Let me at you\u201d and P1 said \u201ccome and get me\u201d. Literally it looked like a fight. But now??? The podcast really threw me off oh my god. (2/2)\u00a0\n...\nTubbo is not supposed to be awake right now but he can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s particularly terrible because he\u2019s exhausted. After the podcast, which was recorded at 1:00pm EST, meaning 5:00pm for Tubbo, he decided that streaming with Tommy for several hours would be a good idea. And then  after  his stream, Tubbo had decided to join a vc with Ranboo while  he was streaming. Tubbo didn\u2019t end up going to bed until nearly three in the morning.\nAnd now he can\u2019t even fall asleep. Dammit.\u00a0\nWith a heavy sigh and an angry grumble, Tubbo turns over on his side and grabs his phone. He can scroll through Twitter or see if Sapnap is still streaming or go through his emails. Speaking of emails, he should check the shared The Multiplayers email.\u00a0\nHe taps the app on his phone and swipes down so the inbox reloads. Oh! An email from the record label.\u00a0\nTubbo opens the email.\nHe reads it.\u00a0\nHe reads it again, just to make sure his eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on him.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Tubbo. Why\u2019re you calling me on my phone?\u201d Ranboo picks up after the second ring.\n\u201cToo lazy to open Discord,\u201d Tubbo says flippantly. He can barely sit still. He can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s trembling from nerves and terror, or bubbling with excitement. Maybe both.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, okay-\u201d\n\u201cAre you still streaming?\u201d\n\u201cNo? You were there when I ended-\u201d\n\u201cHave you checked the email?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo? Is something wrong? I-\u201d\n\u201cWilbur wants to do a collab.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSorry.  What? \u201d\u00a0\n...\nTubbo gets woken up by his phone ringing incessantly in his ear. After freaking the fuck out with Ranboo for a little bit last night (well, early this morning for Tubbo), they agreed to talk about it with Tommy today. After everything, Tubbo fell asleep almost immediately. Emotional rollercoasters really take a lot out of a person.\u00a0\n\u201cTommy? What time-\u201d he checks the digital clock by his bed. \u201cAren\u2019t you in college right now?\u201d\n\u201cTubbo holy shit what the fuck?!\u201d\n\u201cAh. You saw the email?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou saw the email?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? It was marked as read when you saw it, right?\u201d\n\u201cTubbo that is really  not important right now! What the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cYou did ask\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJesus christ. Tubbo! Wilbur wants to do a song with us!\u201d\n\u201cI know, Tommy!\u201d\n\u201cHe- I- We-\u201d Tommy finally stops to take a breath. He\u2019s panting from all the yelling. Finally, quietly, he continues, \u201cHe wrote a song for us.\u201d\nTubbo grins. Tommy sounds so touched. \u201cHe did.\u201d\n\u201cThis is so-\u201d Tommy stops for a moment. Several moments, actually. Tubbo is starting to get worried when Tommy finally says, \u201cWe can\u2019t do it, can we?\u201d He sounds so  heartbroken. It\u2019s excruciating.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cOur\u2026 our secret identities. We-\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it as a band later. Once Ranboo is, you know, actually awake. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tommy says, dejected, \u201cokay.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBoys! What the  fuck are we meant to do?\u201d is the first thing out of Tommy\u2019s mouth when he joins the vc that afternoon.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, show of hands,\u201d Ranboo turns on his camera and everyone else follows suit, \u201cif secret identities weren\u2019t a thing, who would want to do a song with Wilbur?\u201d\nImmediately, all three of them put a hand up. They\u2019re all very serious right now, if a little nervous. Tommy doesn\u2019t even make a joke about a Ranboo hand reveal as if he doesn\u2019t see Ranboo\u2019s face nearly every single day.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tubbo says, \u201cwe have three options.\u201d\n\u201cSay yes and try to keep our identities hidden throughout the entire process,\u201d Ranboo offers.\nTubbo hums, \u201cOr just tell him who we are.\u201d\n\u201cOr,\u201d Tommy\u2019s face falls, \u201cor we have to say  no.\u201d\n...\nThey go with option four.  Don\u2019t say anything at all.  They ask Carlos Avila to tell Wilbur that they will get back to him soon, but seeing as they have some covers that they\u2019re working on (which they actually  aren\u2019t  working on), it\u2019ll be a while before they can do another original.\u00a0\nNow they just have to decide on what covers to do. If they don\u2019t come up with something soon, it\u2019ll be obvious to Wilbur that The Multiplayers are avoiding him. Wilbur is already nervous enough, according to Tommy.\u00a0\n\u201cHe sounded so worried about it,\u201d Tommy relays to them a couple days after they received that initial email. Tommy has just finished filming a mod video with Wilbur, Phil, and Jack Manifold. \u201cHe was afraid he might\u2019ve overstepped or something. I wanted to say something but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard having to keep this from all of our friends, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tubbo mumbles.\u00a0\n\u201cYeh. I wanted so badly to tell him it was fine but-\u201d Tommy tugs at his hair, \u201c-but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to show my face as Player Three, you know?\u201d\nTubbo hums. \u201cI know exactly how you feel. I\u2019ll be playing Valorant with Sneeg or planning Voltz Wars with the Captain and Jack or I\u2019ll be in a call with Phil and Wilbur and one of them will mention one of our songs or a cover that we did and I want to say  thank you  or just- just join in on the conversation. But I\u2019m too scared to reveal my identity. I want to\u2026 but I  don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to being faceless,\u201d Ranboo mutters.\u00a0\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Tommy says. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been faceless.\u201d\n\u201cHow in the fuck do you do it?\u201d Tubbo groans. Ranboo just starts laughing hysterically.\u00a0\n...\nThey finally chose what songs to cover. \u201cThat Unwanted Animal\u201d and \u201cFair\u201d by The Amazing Devil. They do have to change the songs a bit because Tubbo definitely doesn\u2019t have the same range that The Amazing Devil\u2019s singers have.\u00a0\nTubbo sings lead vocals for both songs, as usual, while Ranboo sings Joey Batey\u2019s parts in \u201cThat Unwanted Animal\u201d solely for how deep he can make his voice during the final line of \u201cNo, no, not I.\u201d\u00a0\nThey upload \u201cThat Unwanted Animal\u201d first, saving\u00a0 \u201cFair\u201d for another time to make it look like the songs took them longer than they actually did. The songs aren\u2019t exactly their usual genre of music, but that actually works to their advantage. It gives them a reason behind taking so long to get back to Wilbur.\u00a0\nThe first cover does well. People are excited that they\u2019re branching out into different types of music. But then the time comes when they have to put out the second cover, which means they\u2019ll need to give Wilbur a proper response. It\u2019s been too long, though, since the first cover, so they upload \u201cFair\u201d to YouTube and then jump into a call with each other.\n\u201cOkay, so\u2026 do we have a plan?\u201d Ranboo asks. \u201cWe have to make a decision eventually. Sooner, rather than later.\u201d\n\u201cI really want to do a song with Wilbur,\u201d Tommy\u2019s voice comes through slightly muffled. He\u2019s leaning back in his chair, which he has pushed away from his desk a little. His head is in his hands, like he\u2019s hiding behind them.\u00a0\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Tubbo agrees. Ranboo nods in agreement. \u201cSo, we all want to do it. Now we just have to decide on whether or not we reveal our-\u201d\n\u201cFuck, hold on,\u201d Tommy frowns and abruptly leaves the call.\n\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d Ranboo sits up straighter in his chair. \u201cThe hell?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Tubbo shrugs.\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s just us, then,\u201d Ranboo says.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tubbo frowns. He wonders what\u2019s going on with Tommy. Whatever it is must be pretty important if he decided to leave the call. \u201cJust us.\u201d\n\u201cOh Jesus,\u201d Ranboo\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cNevermind, Tubbo. Just you. I\u2019ll be back in a second, too. So sorry!\u201d\nAnd then it really is just Tubbo, sitting alone in a call, gaping at his screen. Okay, what the fuck? And then he gets several messages through Discord.\nJack ManifoldTubbo!!!!HelpEveryone else i\u2019ve messaged hasn\u2019t responded yetThis is urgentTubboLike TOS urgentTerms of fucking serviceI fucked up.Oh shit.\u00a0\n...\nJack adds Tubbo to a call and Tubbo doesn\u2019t even notice that anybody else is in the call until he hears Tommy say, \u201cJack, what the fuck?\u201d\u00a0\nHold up. Didn\u2019t Jack say nobody else responded? Is this why both of his bandmates just up and disappeared?\n\u201cJack, what did you do?\u201d Ranboo asks, confused.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get fucking banned from Twitch?\u201d Tommy asks. \u201cYou said it was TOS but you don\u2019t seem very worried anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you sounded a lot more freaked out in your messages,\u201d Ranboo adds.\u00a0\nAnd then Jack Manifold grins, which is not the sort of look that Tubbo was expecting from the man who just told him he\u2019d \u201cfucked up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, I lied. Nothing happened, I\u2019m not in any trouble. I simply need to ask you a question,\u201d Jack steeples his hands, leaning forward. \u201cWhat the  fuck  is up with you lot? You three have been acting sketchy for  months. And don\u2019t tell me it has something to do with the smp. I know everything that you\u2019re each doing for lore.\u201d\nFrozen in his seat, Tubbo blurts, \u201cWe\u2019ve been setting up a cool new smp.\u201d\nTo Tubbo\u2019s utter dismay, Tommy speaks at the same time, citing, \u201cHelping each other with homework,\u201d for some reason. Seriously, what the fuck, Tommy? That doesn\u2019t even make any sense. Tubbo isn\u2019t in school anymore.\nTo top it off, half a beat later, Ranboo exclaims, \u201cDungeons and Dragons!\u201d\nThe call goes silent and remains that way for far longer than Tubbo is comfortable with. Finally, Jack, looking skeptical, asks, \u201cAll of those?\u201d He gets a chorus of \u2018yes\u2019s and \u2018yep\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of those  and more,\u201d Tommy waggles his eyebrows, obviously trying to break some of the tension that is currently suffocating the call.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jack says. For a second, Tubbo thinks Jack might seriously believe them. \u201cYou\u2019re all  terrible liars.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Ranboo says under his breath. He obviously intended for nobody to hear that comment but Tubbo still wants to smack him.\u00a0\n\u201cWould I though?\u201d Jack asks, a grin spreading on his face once again. \u201cYou all have secret alt accounts on Twitch so you can watch streams without people knowing you\u2019re there, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but Jack,\u201d Tommy lets out an exasperated huff, \u201cwhat does that have to do with-\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLads,\u201d Jack holds up a hand to stop Tommy. \u201cWho do you think media-shared your first song to Wilbur in the first place?\u201d\nIs this what drowning feels like?\u00a0\nTubbo can\u2019t hear anything. Or, well, he  can, but it\u2019s all muffled. There\u2019s this weird pressure on his chest, like he\u2019s being crushed, and he can\u2019t-\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\nThen just as quickly as the drowning began, Tubbo is being pulled - no, dragged - up from the depths.\nNow he can hear everything so sharply that it\u2019s overwhelming. The pressure on his chest is still there but now he\u2019s breathing far too quickly to be healthy.\u00a0\n\u201cJack,\u201d he registers Tommy saying, \u201cWhat the  fuck? \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ranboo asks, trying to play it off. He\u2019s failing. Tubbo\u2019s next words contradict Ranboo\u2019s though, so it doesn\u2019t matter so much that Ranboo is being really obvious.\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cWell, Tommy and I were in a vc one day and there were drumsticks sitting on the shelves behind him,\u201d Jack says.\n\u201cTommy,\u201d Ranboo scolds.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy snaps, sounding offended.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Jack says, \u201cthat\u2019s only where it started. There\u2019s more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Jack Manifold Interlude\n\n\n\nSeveral Months Ago\n\n\u00a0\nThe drumsticks are strange, sure, but such a minuscule detail that Jack forgets about them completely\u2026\u00a0\n...\nJack has been looking for new music recently and Wilbur recommended some band called Peach Pit. Looking them up is how he finds The Multiplayers. He listens to their cover of \u201cTechno Show\u201d and really enjoys it. Checking out their channel, he finds that they only have two other songs out, a Yungblud cover and a Taylor Swift cover.\u00a0\nHe listens to them both.\nHe reminds himself to subscribe to them whenever he next signs in to his private, personal (and secret from the public) account. They\u2019re really good.\u00a0\nAnd then he sees the photo they used for their \u201cWeird!\u201d cover. It seems vaguely familiar. Like, really strangely familiar, actually.\u00a0\nWith a frown on his face, he opens one of the many Dreamsmp group chats he\u2019s a part of and scrolls past several of the previous conversations until-\nHa! There it is. The same fucking photo.\nWhat the hell?\nThe messages are from about a month ago. Ranboo had sent that photo out of the blue, followed up by several messages in quick succession.\u00a0\nRanbooLook I actually went outside today!Oh\u00a0OopsWrong chatSorryEnjoy the sunset tho i guess\nThe only response that Ranboo had gotten was:\nJack ManifoldAhahaIt\u2019s okayNice sunset\nOkay, so that\u2019s weird, right? Why would The Multiplayers have the same photo that Ranboo apparently took and then accidentally sent to a private smp group chat?\u00a0\nMaybe a member of The Multiplayers is in the group chat that the photo actually  was  intended for?  Yeah, that\u2019s probably it,  Jack rationalizes.\u00a0\n...\nAlright, some parts of The Multiplayers\u2019 new cover sound suspiciously like Ranboo is singing. Jack isn\u2019t one to speculate much but one of the singers sounds  so much like Ranboo that it\u2019s actually sort of scary.\u00a0\nThe cover is \u201cMidnight Memories\u201d by One Direction and while the person who seems to be doing lead vocals is still doing just that, the other members of the band are singing as well.\nAnd one of them sounds like Ranboo.\nJack has to admit that he  is  speculating. After the sunset picture, and then the Ranboo-sounding guy, Jack remembers the  drumsticks . Tommy had had random drumsticks on his shelves one day. Jack hadn\u2019t asked about them, too preoccupied at first, then simply forgetting about them later. Now, he wishes he had asked, because things are getting\u2026\u00a0\nListen, it may just be a big conspiracy theory, but Jack thinks that Ranboo and Tommy might be in a band. They might be The Multiplayers, to be specific.\nAnd where they go, Tubbo goes. (Or perhaps it\u2019s the other way around, but nevertheless, the three of them are inseparable.)\nAfter listening to their covers on repeat, Jack thinks Tubbo sort of sounds like the lead singer - or Player One, as they\u2019ve now been dubbed.\u00a0\nHe knows that it\u2019s crazy. His friends secretly being part of some faceless band? That\u2019s weird. But, he  does have evidence. He supposes he\u2019ll just have to wait and see. If it really is them, they won\u2019t keep it a secret for long, surely.\u00a0\n...\nJack\u2019s mad theory gets proven correct the day that The Mutliplayers release their first song, \u201cLost and Losing\u201d.\u00a0\nHe gets the little notification that tells him they\u2019ve posted something new. Seeing as he isn\u2019t meant to stream for another twenty minutes, he pulls up the video and hits play.\nIt\u2019s a really good song, and he\u2019s glad The Multiplayers have branched out into original music. It\u2019s when the Bridge begins that everything falls into place. At first, Jack thinks he\u2019s mistaken, so he restarts the bridge and listens to it again.\u00a0\nHe knows this bridge.\nHe\u2019s heard the tune, heard some of the lines, too.\u00a0\nA week ago.\nFrom  Tubbo .\u00a0\n...\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Ranboo asks incredulously. \u201cYou figured it all out because you heard Tubbo  humming.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tubbo mutters.\n\u201cTo be fair,\u201d Jack says, \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I hadn\u2019t already been suspecting something.\u201d\n\u201cSo it was a group effort then?\u201d Tommy inquires.\nJack hums, \u201cA group effort. And uh, don\u2019t worry about me telling anyone. I\u2019ve kept it a secret this long, I\u2019m not about to stop.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ranboo sighs. The tension that Tubbo hadn\u2019t even realized was in him slowly begins to seep away.\u00a0\n\u201cMan, you really scared me, there,\u201d Tubbo says.\n\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019re you telling us this  now?\u201d Ranboo questions.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I first found out, I decided I would just sit back and let everything play out. I shared your song with Wilbur because your music is actually incredible and I figured Wil would like it. Other than that, I decided not to meddle. But only\u2026 only because I thought you would have told  somebody  about the band by now. Whether it be Wilbur or Phil or fucking Dream even. But it\u2019s been months and  nothing. And then Wil kept talking about how worried he was that he\u2019d overstepped in asking The Multiplayers to do a song with him.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tommy mumbles.\n\u201cYeah, oh,\u201d Jack sighs. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you said yes yet?\u201d\n\u201cYet?\u201d Tommy asks.\n\u201cWell, you  are going to say yes,\u201d nobody responds. Concerned, Jack adds, \u201cAren\u2019t you?\nRanboo huffs. \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong, we want to, but-\u201d\n\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d\n\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d get this big,\u201d Tubbo says, finding his voice. \u201cWe never expected the fans and the- the popularity and the  record deal. The band was half  joke  when we started it. And now everything is just so- so  big. Everything feels like such a big deal and revealing our identities-\u201d Tubbo cuts himself off. He\u2019s working himself up too much.\u00a0\n\u201cRevealing our identities,\u201d Ranboo continues, \u201cis a huge step. One that we aren\u2019t sure we\u2019re ready to take. We didn\u2019t expect for an identity reveal to be such a big deal. But as we got more well-known as a band, it became  a thing .\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut guys\u2026\u201d Jack says, \u201cit\u2019s  Wilbur.\u201d\u00a0 \nTubbo has to double-check to make sure he didn\u2019t go on deafen because the call goes completely silent.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, yeh,\u201d Tommy finally says, \u201cit\u2019s Wilbur. We\u2019ve been keeping this from him, from everyone, for months. What if he-\u201d Tommy chokes.\n\u201cWhat if he gets angry?\u201d Tubbo finishes.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you seriously think Wilbur will be angry with you for wanting to keep your band a secret? For wanting to keep it private?\u201d Jack asks. \u201cIf anything, I think he\u2019d be proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cProud?\u201d Ranboo asks, incredulous.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re making amazing music, you got signed, people  love  you,\u201d Jack lists, \u201cand\u2026 and you\u2019re having  fun.  Wilbur has already said he\u2019s proud of you boys for  far less. It\u2019s frankly ridiculous that he would think anything else.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cJack\u2019s  right.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Jack teases, lightening the mood.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d Tubbo tentatively speaks up. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d\n...\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you reached out,\u201d Wilbur says. \u201cI was worried that I sounded too pushy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Tubbo , armed with a voice changer and no facecam, is currently the band\u2019s spokesperson. They\u2019re all in the call, but considering Tommy is kind of terrified and this was Tubbo\u2019s idea in the first place, they figured he could do the talking. For now. \u201cWe were just\u2026 busy recently.\u201d\n\u201cYeah! Congrats on the record deal, by the way,\u201d Wilbur says. He\u2019s got his camera on so Tubbo can see him smiling. Tubbo grins back, despite his nerves and the fact that Wilbur can\u2019t actually see him. He can\u2019t believe they\u2019re about to do this. He can\u2019t believe it took Jack Manifold slapping some sense into them to get them to do this in the first place.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you. Thanks,\u201d Tubbo responds.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wilbur says. \u201cSo, did you have a chance to look at the song I sent you? Or did you want to write something else?\u201d\nTubbo sucks in a breath. Faintly, he hears Ranboo do the same. Oh god. Here we go. \u201cWe actually wanted to tell you something first.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, uh\u2026 through song? If that\u2019s okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Wilbur says, sounding very much  unsure.  This probably seems a bit weird from his perspective, now that Tubbo thinks about it. Actually, it probably seems more than just  a bit weird.\u00a0\nRanbooWe\u2019ve got this you guys.\nTommyThanks big man\nTubbo turns on his mic and hits the first notes on his keyboard, beginning the first verse of \u201cFearless\u201d by Louis Tomlinson.\u00a0\n\u201cTell me, do you, tell me, do you still remember feeling young?\u201d He sings the first line of the chorus himself. Then, the rest of the band joins in on their instruments - Ranboo pre-recorded his guitar parts so he\u2019s currently on bass - and they all sing together to finish off the first chorus.\n\n Tell me the truth, tell me, do you still remember feeling young\nAnd strong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people?\nJust for tonight, look inside and spark that memory of you\nStrong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people.\u00a0\n\n \u201cFearless,\u201d they sing.\n\u201c Fearless,\u201d Tubbo turns on his camera.\nA beat later, Ranboo sings, \u201cFearless,\u201d and his camera goes on as well.\nAnd finally, Tommy finishes the post-chorus, \u201cFearless.\u201d\u00a0\nWilbur watches in disbelief, mouth hanging open, as they finish the song. Tubbo focuses on singing and playing so he doesn\u2019t have to think about whatever Wilbur\u2019s reaction is going to be.\u00a0\nTubbo sings the final line on his own, then finally looks up to watch Wilbur, waiting for the man to say something.\u00a0\nAfter what feels like forever, Wilbur, with wide eyes, says, \u201cWhat the  fuck?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cSurprise?\u201d Tommy waves, drumstick still in his hand.\u00a0\nWilbur disconnects from the call.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Ranboo says.\nWilbur reconnects.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Wilbur sighs, sounding rather put-upon, \u201cI should have fucking known, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2026 we kept it a secret on purpose,\u201d Tommy says.\n\u201cI literally said that Tubbo sounds like Player-\u201d Wilbur freezes, eyes going wide all over again. \u201cTubbo.\u201d\u201cUh? Yes?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t use Twitter but I  have been told-\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tubbo can\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Wilbur seems to be taking this well and the relief of that has left Tubbo feeling a bit hysterical, to be honest. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been fighting with myself on Twitter.\u201d\n\u201cFlerting,\" Tommy teases.\nWilbur shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cI cannot believe you guys,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re  The Multiplayers. You-\u201d he gets a strange look on his face, soft, genuine, \u201cyou make spectacular music. I had no idea you were so talented.\u201d\nTubbo smiles. The fear and nervousness that had been filling him up for weeks has completely vanished. What\u2019s left now is excitement and elation and  peace.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Wilbur,\u201d Tommy ducks his head, trying to hide his grin.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wilbur smiles. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. All of you.\u201d\n...\nThey spend  hours  telling Wilbur  everything . When it\u2019s all done, Wilbur looks even more awed than before. They perform all of their original songs for him and the excitement on his face is contagious. Tubbo can\u2019t believe he was ever worried about telling Wilbur.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to tell the others?\u201d Wilbur asks when they finish \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d. He doesn\u2019t specify who \u2018the others\u2019 are but Tubbo knows he means the rest of the smp and their other streaming and YouTube friends.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tommy says, \u201cnot yet.\u201d\n\u201cBut eventually?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Ranboo nods.\u00a0\nWilbur hums, \u201cWell. I\u2019ll have your back whenever you decide to tell anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Wilbur,\u201d Tubbo says.\n\u201cYeah, we seriously appreciate it,\u201d Ranboo adds.\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d Wilbur tilts his head to the side. \u201cSo, about that song that I wrote-\u201d\nTubbo can\u2019t believe that Wilbur actually thought they might not like the song he wrote. It\u2019s, frankly, ridiculous. Of course they like the song! It\u2019s actually strange how perfect the song is for the Four of them, especially since Wilbur wrote it before discovering who The Multiplayers are.\u00a0\nThey do need to work on it, though, because Tommy wants to make the drum part a little more complicated and Wilbur wants to make some of the lyrics flow a little better. They also decide to switch up some of the line distribution. One of the main changes is giving Tubbo\u2019s line in Verse 2 to Tommy.\u00a0\nIt\u2019ll be a while yet before they release the song, but Tubbo is already excited for the reaction it\u2019s going to get. It\u2019s a  damn good song. The plan, however, is to release it on their EP as one of the two extra songs they\u2019re allowed to put on it. Wilbur had readily agreed to the idea, but it means they\u2019ll have to keep the collab a secret for a long time. They want it to be a surprise, after all.\u00a0\n...\nRanboo is streaming so  of course Tubbo is going to call him. It\u2019s not like Tubbo has anything better to do\u2026\u00a0\nHe should probably be sleeping, actually, but fuck if he\u2019s actually going to. He wants to talk to Ranboo. Tommy is asleep already for sure and Wilbur- Tubbo actually has no idea what Wilbur is up to but he hasn\u2019t been answering any of Tubbo\u2019s messages so he\u2019s probably busy or asleep.\nHe really wants to talk to Ranboo.\nSo he jumps into the vc that Ranboo and Techno are in. Neither of them are doing lore. In fact, Tubbo isn\u2019t actually sure that Techno is even on the smp right now, but Ranboo is just mining so it\u2019s fine for all of them to talk, he figures.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Tubbo,\u201d Ranboo says, chuckling a little. Tubbo wonders if Ranboo even had to check to see who joined the call or if he just  knew.\u00a0 \n\u201cHello Ranboo.\u201d\n\u201cOh, hi Tubbo,\u201d Techno greets.\n\u201cHello, Technoblade.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cOh jeez,\u201d Ranboo says, \u201cdon\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\u201cI wanna talk to Ranboo,\u201d Tubbo whines as explanation. They end up talking about food because apparently, all of them are hungry but none of them are willing to actually get up and get themselves some food. Chat keeps telling them to feed themselves and when that doesn\u2019t work, they at least get Ranboo to hydrate.\u00a0\nRanboo also spends the time answering questions from donos, and everything is going fine until someone asks \u201cHey what\u2019s your favourite song by The Multiplayers?\u201d\nRanboo immediately says that he can\u2019t decide on a favourite. Tubbo jokes that he likes all the songs except for the one written by Player One, which Ranboo\u2019s chat gets rather upset about.\u00a0\nTechno answers the question too, this time. \u201cI like all of them,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the metaphors in Masked are pretty great.\u201d\n\u201cWhat metaphors?\u201d Ranboo asks.\u00a0\nTubbo catches on immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s a metaphor?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAre you bein\u2019 serious?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? What are you talking about?\u201d Ranboo plays up the confusion.\n\u201cYeah, I thought that song was about murder or something\u2026\u201d Tubbo has to mute himself so he doesn\u2019t give it away from laughing so hard.\u00a0\nTubbo unmutes just as Techno sighs, long-suffering, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re just as bad as Tommy.\u201d\nTubbo mutes again.\u00a0\nA little later, another dono comes through, asking Ranboo if he plays any instruments. Ranboo, who is currently fighting two creepers and a zombie while on low health, answers without thinking. \u201cAn instrument? Yeah.\u201d\nTubbo\u2019s eyes go wide. Techno makes a small noise of surprise, which is probably what alerts Ranboo of his mistake.\u00a0\n\u201cHa. The, uh, the tambourine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Techno deadpans.\n\u201cYep. Tambourine.\u201d\n\u201cTubbo,\u201d the next dono asks, \u201care you in love with Player One.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n...\nWilburTubbo\nTubboMr. Soot\nWilburWhy?\nTubboBahahahahaha\nWilburSeriously, though, be careful. People might get weird about it.\nTubboI know.I\u2019ll be careful and I\u2019ll shut it down if it gets weirdIt\u2019s just meant to be fun.\nWilburOkay.Do you think Ranboo can actually play the tambourine?\nTubboAbsolutely.\u00a0\n...\nThe next two covers they do are \u201cHydrangea\u201d by Census and \u201cEx-Wives\u201d from Six: The Musical. They\u2019ve been working on learning the music for \u201cHydrangea\u201d for a while now and they added the piano from the version of the song \u201cHydrangea Reimagined\u201d, somewhat combining the two versions of the song.\u00a0\nThey release the cover into the waiting arms of their fans, who get really excited about it. It looks like a lot of them are happy to see The Multiplayers doing another rock song. More rock music might be on their horizon, it seems.\n\u201cEx-Wives\u201d is a project they started working on some time ago. They put it to the side after things started picking up for them because they wanted to do it properly.  Properly involves all of them singing, because there are six parts in the musical and only three of them.\nTommy is cast as Catherine of Aragon.\nTubbo is Anne Boleyn.\nRanboo sings the part of Jane Seymour.\nTommy also sings as Anna of Cleves.\nTubbo plays Katherine Howard.\nLastly, Ranboo is Catherine Parr.\n Properly also involves some video editing, because they make a lyric video for the cover. That way, it\u2019s easier to see who\u2019s singing what line.\u00a0\nAll of the work that they put into the cover pays off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n 10,135 Comments \n\nWottlesOh my god this was everything\nPh1LzA \u2713Very cool\nSalted Chocolate Chipthe multiplayers never fail to impress me that was spectacular and omg i\u2019m so happy that we get to hear more player two singing. he\u2019s usually so far in the background\nKatherine ReedWhy did Henry marry so many C(K)atherines? And two anne(a)s??? Wtf.\u00a0\nThe Multiplayers \u2713We agree. That is very weird. Wtf henry.\u00a0\nTam FoxI love SIX!! The Multiplayers are really out here doing covers for all of my fav musicals, huh?\n...\n\n Messages: WE KNOW \n\nJack ManifoldWhy did you not tell me you were going to do that???Why haven\u2019t I heard of this musical?Tubbo broke england from the church apparentlyRanboo really just said: \u201cI died\u201d\u00a0And tommy said that Henry VIII had a small dick\nWilburSIX: The Musical.\u00a0British Hamilton\nTommyWilbur what the fuck\nRanbooJack you should listen to the rest of the musical.\u00a0\nTommyNo, seriously wilburWhat the fuck???\nTubboOh my god Ranboo!\nRanbooTubbo!?\nTubboWe should watch Six on your alt twitch\nRanbooI think streaming slime tutorials might be illegal\nWilburOut of context that message looks weird as fuck RanbooAlso well done you guys. Your last two covers are terrific. Seriously, I\u2019m blown away by how amazing you three are.\u00a0Also don\u2019t do anything illegal please\nTommyNo promises\nTubboNo promisesTommy you stole my reply :(\u00a0\nTommyNo you stole mineBitch.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cGuys, I made a mistake,\u201d is not a sentence that Tubbo expected would come out of Ranboo\u2019s mouth, and yet here they are. It\u2019s been several days since they released \u201cEx-Wives\u201d. They haven\u2019t had a lot of time since then to do The Multiplayers things because of streaming. Smp lore is really kicking them in the asses, but none of them are complaining because it\u2019s fun as hell.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tubbo asks cautiously. The last time somebody freaked out, it was Tommy scaring all of them into thinking that Technoblade had done something like reveal their identities or something. And then it had turned out to be  nothing.\u00a0 \n\u201cI accidentally told a friend about the band\u2026\u201d So, not nothing then. \u201cThey\u2019re a friend from school. The only person who knows about me being Ranboo, too.\u201d\nTommy manages to top Ranboo\u2019s earlier statement as \u2018the most unexpected thing Tubbo has heard this week\u2019 (this week and not this month or year because a  lot of weird shit happens to Tubbo, believe him) by blurting, \u201cOh thank fuck.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 what?\u201d Ranboo\u2019s brows scrunch together.\n\u201cEryn and Freddie have known for fucking  months,\u201d Tommy confesses. What the hell? Why didn\u2019t Tommy tell them? He asks Tommy as much. \u201cI dunno. I was worried you\u2019d be mad about it? I swore them to secrecy! And they haven\u2019t told anyone, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s okay that my friend knows then?\u201d Ranboo asks, worried.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Ranboo, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Tommy tells him.\n\u201cWait, is it?\u201d Tubbo asks. He figures it probably is, but they haven\u2019t exactly spoken about this sort of thing yet.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Tommy shrugs. It seems like that\u2019s that, until Ranboo gasps so loudly that his mic briefly cuts out.\n\u201cTubbo,\u201d Ranboo says, \u201cdoes this mean you  haven\u2019t told anyone?\u201d\nTommy bursts out laughing. It\u2019s not long until Ranboo and Tubbo join in.\n\u201cI can\u2019t- I can\u2019t believe that-\u201d Tommy tries to catch his breath in order to finish the sentence, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that, out of all of us-\u201d he gasps,  \u201cTubbo is the one who hasn\u2019t let the secret slip to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Tubbo grins. \u201cI can keep a secret.\u201d\n...\nTubbo is upset. There\u2019s a song that he wants The Multiplayers to cover but he knows that they can\u2019t. Not if they want to keep their identities a secret.\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cThere\u2019s a song that I think would be so great to do, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tubbo sighs.\n\u201cDerivakat,\u201d they both say at the same time.\n\u201cSo I guess I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been thinking about her songs?\u201d Tommy asks. Tubbo hadn\u2019t even noticed him join the call.\u00a0\n\u201cGuess not,\u201d Ranboo says.\n\u201cHer songs would be so fun to cover,\u201d Tommy sighs.\n\u201cMaybe someday,\u201d Ranboo says wistfully.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tubbo mutters. \u201cSomeday.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWilburYou know, you could still learn to play the songs anywayJust don\u2019t record them.\nJack ManifoldYou could even record them, if you wanted to.Just don\u2019t post them\nRanbooThat\u2019s actually not a terrible idea\u2026Guys?\nTommyLet\u2019s fucking do it.\u00a0\n...\nTommy is late for his own mod video. Tubbo rolls his eyes. He\u2019s currently sitting in a vc with Wilbur, Jack, and Phil. They\u2019ve been waiting for a while, not that any of them mind. They\u2019ve been having fun just chatting with each other and they all enjoy doing the mod videos anyway.\u00a0\nTubbo does wish that they could get on with it, though. Jack said that he had an idea he wanted to run by him after filming. It apparently involves The Multiplayers. Due to Phil being in the call, they can\u2019t exactly talk about it yet.\nPhil. Tubbo kind of wishes they could tell Phil. Maybe he should bring it up with the rest of the band. Tommy will probably be on board. Ranboo, too. Philza Minecraft is great, after all.\u00a0\n Finally, Tommy joins the call. He starts talking immediately (which is not unexpected for mid-afternoon pre-filming Tommy).\u00a0\nWhat  is unexpected (Tubbo needs to change \u2018the most unexpected thing Tubbo has heard this week\u2019 into \u2018the most unexpected thing Tubbo has heard today\u2019 because the weird shit has been coming at alarming rates recently), are the words that come out of Tommy\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cTubbo, you have  got  to stop flirting with yourself on The Multiplayers Twitter account!\u201d Oh fuck. Tommy hasn\u2019t noticed that Phil is in the call. How the fuck hasn\u2019t he noticed? Tubbo sits, frozen, as Tommy continues to ramble. \u201cYou accidentally signed off your last tweet as Player Three!  I don\u2019t want to flirt with you, full offence.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh- Tommy,\u201d thank god for Wilbur. Tubbo can\u2019t seem to find his voice right now. When he was thinking about telling Phil, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t supposed to go like  this. \u201cTommy we aren\u2019t\u2026 alone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Wilbur what the fuck is that supposed to-\u201d Tommy cuts himself off. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack cringes. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Phil sighs, \u201cI really should have seen this one coming. Why am I not surprised?\u201d\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve gotten too comfortable. Now that Wilbur and Jack know, The Multiplayers got comfortable talking about the band with them. Tubbo knows that\u2019s why Tommy didn\u2019t even notice Phil in the call. He saw Wilbur and Jack (and Tubbo) and thought it would be fine. As if he wasn\u2019t the one to invite Phil for the video in the first place.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Tommy says. The call remains quiet for a good few seconds before Phil sighs again.\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he says. \u201cYou, Tubbo\u2026 and Ranboo?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Tommy says.\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou three are amazing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tubbo blurts, finding his voice.\u00a0\n\u201cYour music is amazing. Kristin and I love it,\u201d Phil says genuinely. Mumza! Tubbo smiles. He honestly isn\u2019t very worried anymore. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019ve already gotten through two people finding out, maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s Phil, maybe it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t care as much about keeping a secret identity anymore.\n\u201cAwe,\u201d Tommy gasps, over-the-top but clearly touched,  \u201cPhil.\u201d\u00a0 \nThey end up spending some time telling Phil about how the band started. They get to gush about the collab that they\u2019re doing with Wilbur, too. Phil mentions the Tubbo and Player One rivalry-to-romance story which sets Tubbo into a fit of laughter.\u00a0\n\u201cTubbo!\u201d Tommy shrieks. \u201cThat reminds me! Fix your Tweet! Or else you\u2019ve just formed a love triangle!\u201d\nTubbo does fix the tweet by responding to it with \u201cshit this is from P1 not P3 I\u2019m so sorry @TubboLive.\u201d\u00a0\nThey eventually get around to filming the mod video. Afterwards, Phil goes quiet for a second, then says, \u201cHoly shit. Have you boys been messing with Techno about metaphors this entire time?\u201d\nTommy and Tubbo can\u2019t respond for a full two minutes. They\u2019re laughing too hard.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cPhil knows,\u201d is the first thing Tommy says when they get into a call with Ranboo later that day. Wilbur should be joining the call any minute now, as well. They\u2019re rehearsing his song.\n\u201cWhat? How?\u201d Ranboo questions.\u00a0\n\u201cTommy,\u201d Tubbo responds, only  Ranboo says it at the same time, answering himself.\n\u201cWha- Ranboo!\u201d Tommy complains. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even there!\u201d\n\u201cBut I was right, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWhat was Ranboo right about?\u201d Wilbur asks, joining the call.\u00a0\n\u201cTommy told Phil,\u201d Ranboo explains.\n\u201cOh. Yeah, I was there.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t  tell him\u2026\u201d Tommy winces. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize he was in the call.\u201d\nThey rehearse Wil\u2019s song for a while. The bridge is particularly complicated, especially because Tubbo and Wilbur worked for a while to add even more to it. They also spend a lot of time working on the vocal harmonies.\u00a0\n\u201cHow are we going to record this?\u201d Wilbur asks while they take a break. Tubbo explains to him how they usually do it. Wilbur sort of knew already how they recorded and mixed their songs, but when Tubbo explains the whole process more in-depth, he grows even more impressed with all of them.\u00a0\n\u201cThe label suggested we re-record the other songs with better microphones and stuff for the EP, though,\u201d Ranboo explains.\n\u201cBut they\u2019re still going to let me mix the songs!\u201d Tubbo grins.\u00a0\n\u201cRanboo are you going to come to the UK to record?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ranboo says.\n\u201cI think we were all just going to record our parts at the studios closest to us,\u201d Tommy answers.\n\u201cThe travel ban has been lifted,\u201d Wilbur points out.\n\u201cRanboo-\u201d Tubbo starts.\n\u201c-How would you like to come to the UK?\u201d Tommy finishes.\u00a0\n...\nMaya Dean | @M_ayaDeanOh my god when Player One accidentally signed a tweet for Tubbo as Player Three I got so scared.\n\u00a0\nGreen Cat | @wotlen\u00a0I know! I was like P3 is coming for your man, P1\n\u00a0\nI guess | @LoveTheMultiplayersI\u2019m so excited for the @TheMultiplayers EP!!!!!\n\u00a0\nNick Halden | @NotCaffreyIt would be so cool if @TheMultiplayers did covers for every SIX song\n\u00a0\nYep | @Hen118You\u2019re right!!!! (no pressure tho lol)\n\u00a0\nKath | @WOOoo_Someone asked for this and I am so happy to provide: @TheMultiplayers as ATLA benders - a thread\n\u00a0\nKath | @WOOoo_Player One: Fire bender - I feel like he\u2019d either be a fire bender or like, from the earth kingdom (but not an earth bender).\nKath | @WOOoo_Player Two: Earth bender - it was this or water but i feel like Player Two is a very grounded person so I chose earth solely for the pun\u2026 And also because i just think it fits.\nKath | @WOOoo_Player Three: Air bender - I almost said fire bender but I feel like air fits better? Idk why tho.\nKath | @WOOoo_Alright, that\u2019s the thread. Feel free to make art lol\n...\nTubbo is on the Dream smp server but he isn\u2019t streaming. He\u2019s pretty sure Foolish is streaming, but he doesn\u2019t feel like joining any streams right now. Karl and Sapnap are also on the smp somewhere but Tubbo thinks Karl ended his stream at least a half-hour ago.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s confused right now. Sapnap is asking him to join their vc. Tubbo frowns but joins nonetheless.\n\u201cTubbo!\u201d Karl exclaims.\n\u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cHey man,\u201d Sapnap says. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\nSomewhat puzzled, Tubbo says, \u201cI\u2019m well. How are you both?\u201d He supposes it isn\u2019t too surprising that they just want to chat.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Karl says. \u201cBut we are a bit worried about you.\u201d\nOkay, what? What does that mean? Why would they be worried about Tubbo? Did something happen recently?\u00a0\n\u201cUm, how come?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo specific reason,\u201d Sapnap says. \u201cBut you have seemed a little more tired than usual.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been streaming less than usual,\u201d Karl adds.\n\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d Tubbo can\u2019t help but ask.\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sapnap rushes to say. \u201cNo, stream as much or as little as you want, Tubbo. We just mean that you used to be very consistent about streaming every day. It\u2019s okay to take a break! We just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOverwhelmed,\u201d Karl supplies, \u201cor exhausted. Burnt out?\u201d\n\u201cOr, if you  are, that you\u2019re taking care of yourself,\u201d Sapnap continues, \u201cOr getting support.\u201d\nTubbo knows the reason behind his stream schedule and his sleepiness is the band. But he can\u2019t say that. \u201cEverything is fine. I\u2019m just taking some time for myself,\u201d he tells them instead.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Karl says, dragging out the word a little. Tubbo winces. Karl clearly doesn\u2019t believe him.\u00a0\n\u201cListen,\u201d Tubbo says, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go. My sister needs my help with something.\u201d\nTubbo flees the call before Karl and Sapnap can say anything more.\u00a0\n...\nHe calls Sapnap back later that night. One person isn\u2019t as nerve-wracking as two.\n\u201cI\u2019m Player One.\u201d\nAlright, if the others have both told at least one person, other than Jack, Wilbur, and Phil, then Tubbo gets to tell one person too. Who better than someone that he trusts? It\u2019ll also help get Sapnap off his back. He appreciates the worry but it\u2019s truly unnecessary.\u00a0\nSapnap doesn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. Tubbo prepares to lay down his proof, but Sapnap speaks before it\u2019s needed. \u201cOh for fucks sake.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I just mean,\u201d Sapnap takes a breath, \u201cin hindsight, it\u2019s sort of\u2026 obvious? But I never would have known if you hadn\u2019t just said it outright.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Alright.\u201d\n\u201cI- are you flirting with yourself on Twitter?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 yes?\u201d\nThat seems to lighten the mood. They both laugh over the absurdity of it.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, why are you telling me this now?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be worried about me,\u201d Tubbo explains.\n\u201cI mean, it explains why you\u2019ve been streaming less,\u201d Sapnap says, \u201cbut I\u2019m still sort of worried. You don\u2019t want to overwork yourself.\u201d\nTubbo smiles. \u201cThanks, Sap, but it\u2019s alright. Wilbur has been on our asses about not overworking ourselves lately. We\u2019ve been getting better about taking breaks and getting sleep.\u201d\n\u201cWilbur knows?\u201d\n\u201cAnd Phil and Jack,\u201d Tubbo says. \u201cJack actually figured it out on his own.\u201d\n\u201cWell shit,\u201d Sapnap says, sounding impressed. \u201cAnd, um, who\u2019s  we? Is it actually\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTommy and Ranboo?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the fucking conspiracy theories are  true,\" then, \u201cTommy is totally Player Three, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n...\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you told  Sapnap,\u201d Tommy grumbles. Tubbo just laughs at him. He\u2019s glad he told Sapnap. Now there\u2019s one more person that he can talk to about the band. One more person he can be completely honest with, no hiding things, no lies.\u00a0\n\u201cYou told Eryn and Freddie,\u201d he counters.\n\u201cTubbo has a point,\u201d Ranboo says. \u201cWe all told someone, it\u2019s only fair that he be allowed to someone, too. Plus, it\u2019s Sapnap. He\u2019s good at keeping secrets. He knows what Dream\u2019s face looks like and he hasn\u2019t shown anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I think that\u2019s just decency and like, being friends,\u201d Tubbo says.\n\u201cYeah. He\u2019s decent and he\u2019s your friend.\u201d\n\u201cCan we get back to the song?\u201d Tommy asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought it up,\u201d Ranboo chuckles. Nevertheless, they do get back to writing their song. \u201cFlowers\u201d, as they\u2019ve titled it, is going to be the final song on their album. It\u2019s a sappy as hell bubblegum pop love song and Tubbo  adores it. Once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s going to be so fucking fun to play and to sing.\nThe first two verses go like this:\n With the sun shining down on me Flowers surrounding me I know that all I need now Is you! \n With your heartwarming smiles, I\u2019m so often beguiled. My thoughts go on for miles \u2018Bout you!\nThey just need to write a third verse now, although they\u2019re thinking of changing the guitar chord progression as well. Ranboo and Tommy are both going to record guitar parts for the song, Ranboo doing the main melody while Tommy does rhythm guitar. First they have to actually finish the chord progression, though.\u00a0\nThen they get to record it! They\u2019re going to wait to record it until Ranboo arrives in the UK. Then they\u2019ll spend some time re-recording their older songs and newly recording \u201cFlowers\u201d and their song with Wilbur.\u00a0\nTubbo is so freaking excited for him to finally arrive. It\u2019ll be Tubbo\u2019s first time seeing him in person  and  the first time that they\u2019ll all be together as a band.  And,  as long as they keep it a secret that  The Multiplayers are meeting up, they don\u2019t have to keep it a secret that the three of them as streamers are meeting up. They can do streams together!\n...\nThey\u2019ve been spending so much time working on their original songs and streaming that The Multiplayers\u2019 fanbase is getting\u2026 antsy. Luckily, they have one cover that they only need to record vocals for, having already played and mixed the music, so they find the time to do that.\nThey release their cover of\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d by Weathers. Player Three sings it. Their fans rejoice. A shit ton of TikTok videos are made using soundbites from the cover. The Multiplayers briefly trend on Twitter. Buzzfeed makes a list of \u201cThe Multiplayers\u2019 Top Ten Covers\u201d.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s strange, because it\u2019s a similar reaction to what Tubbo sometimes gets when he streams. People  missing him after a long period of silence. People getting excited whenever he streams, whenever he shows up on someone else\u2019s stream. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s touching that people care so much, but it also puts a lot of pressure on the band to constantly put out songs.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also the constant pressure to reveal their faces. Tubbo has no idea how Ranboo copes, considering he gets  double the pressure.\u00a0\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Ranboo says one day, after Tubbo has brought up the face reveal pressure. Ranboo barely gets three words into explaining it before Tommy is already agreeing. Tubbo feels like an evil mastermind just thinking about it.\u00a0\n...\nThe video is titled \u201cFace Reveal!!!\u201d\nThe cover that they do -\u00a0 because of course they\u2019re actually going to cover the song, not just put the original into the video - is \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d by Rick Astley.\u00a0\n\n 7194 Comments \n\nSalted Chocolate ChipWe really should have been expecting this\u2026\u00a0\nPh1LzA \u2713Oh my god\n\u00a0\nThe Multiplayers \u2713AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA - P3\nPLUETOWHAT THE FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKERS\nTam FoxAs mad as you might be that they tricked us, you gotta admit that their cover is really good.\nWottlesOh\n\u00a0\nThe cover seems to get the message across that they don\u2019t want to do an identity reveal.\u00a0\nExcept, Tubbo\u2019s starting to think that maybe\u2026 maybe he  does.\u00a0 \n\nRanboo is in the UK. This is not a drill.\u00a0\n\n\nTubbo hasn\u2019t actually met up with him yet because he\u2019s quarantining for ten days in a hotel (better safe than sorry, or whatever) but the fact that he\u2019s even here is incredible.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Ranboo flew to England, The Multiplayers recorded one more cover that they would release in the middle of the ten day quarantine so that there wouldn\u2019t be some unexpected hiatus. The song is \u201cSorry\u201d by Joshua Bassett.\u00a0\n\n\nThankfully, Ranboo can stream from his hotel since he never uses a camera and therefore won\u2019t give away that he\u2019s gone anywhere. His setup is kind of a mess, because, while he was able to bring his microphone from home, the rest of it is made up of a bunch of extra parts from Tommy, Tubbo, and Wilbur.\u00a0\n\n\nThe rest of their time is spent working on their song with Wilbur and finishing \u201cFlowers\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRanboo also starts learning how to play his keytar. He\u2019s apparently had it for a while but never learned how to play it. Instead of bringing more of his streaming setup, he decided to bring the keytar so he would have something to do during quarantine. Tubbo can\u2019t imagine how boring it must be, being stuck all alone in a hotel room with no in-person interactions with \n\nanybody.\n\n\n\nTubbo is pretty sure that Ranboo has started writing a song that involves the keytar (even though they could just use Tubbo\u2019s keyboard?), but he can\u2019t be certain.\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tubbo and Tommy have to pretend that one of their best friends (and bandmates) isn\u2019t visiting. Tubbo keeps accidentally talking about Ranboo visiting in present tense instead of future whenever his chat asks about it. Ranboo tweets \u201cthe weather in england is so weird??\u201d and has to play it off as Tommy complaining to him about it on Discord.\u00a0\n\n\nThey\u2019re a bit of a disaster, but Tubbo doesn\u2019t really care. He\u2019s too excited about all of this for it to really matter to him.\n\n...\n\nTubbo \n| @TubboLive\nHey P2 and P3 can we finally meet in person?\n\n\nPreSerum Steve \n| @N_Leeds\nUh? Tubbo do you only want to meet up with 2/3 of The Multiplayers??? I thought you were flirting with P1?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaya Dean\n | @M_ayaDean\n@TubboLive is Player One confirmed? /j\n\n\nGreen Cat \n| @wotlen\u00a0\nWait holy shit is Tubbo Player One? Did he use the wrong account??\n\n...\n\nTubbo has a greater than usual number of Twitter notifications when he wakes up. He barely has time to be concerned about it before Ranboo is busting into the room Tubbo and Tommy are sharing.\u00a0\n\n\n(The American\u2019s ten day quarantine ended yesterday. Tommy and Tubbo arrived in London late last night and checked into the hotel room beside Ranboo\u2019s. They slipped an extra room key under the door for their bandmate to use in the morning.)\n\n\n\u201cTubbo!\u201d Ranboo shouts, panicked. \u201cTubbo!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWha-?\u201d Tommy flails in his bed, startled awake.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYour Tweet from yesterday!\u201d Ranboo shoves his phone into Tubbo\u2019s face. Tubbo grabs the phone to steady it and reads the tweet.\n\n\nThe Tweet that was meant to come from The Multiplayers account.\u00a0\n\n\nThe one that he Tweeted on his \n\nTubbo \n\naccount.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Tommy says. Tubbo turns to find a half-asleep Tommy staring down at his own phone, obviously looking at the Tweet. Tommy rubs at his eyes and reads it again, like he\u2019s just too tired to be seeing it right. When he finds that it hasn\u2019t changed, he mutters, \u201cshit,\u201d one more time for good measure.\u00a0\n\n\nTubbo- Tubbo might cry, actually. He can\u2019t believe he fucked up so badly. The others must notice that he\u2019s on the verge of tears because Ranboo immediately backs off and climbs onto the end of Tubbo\u2019s bed. Tommy sits up and swings his legs over the edge of his own bed to face Tubbo.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey, listen,\u201d Ranboo says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. We can figure something out, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Tommy says, looking pensive, \u201cyou didn\u2019t sign the Tweet off as Player One. I think I have a way that we can fix this.\u201d\n\n...\n\nThe Multiplayers\n | @TheMultiplayers\nLol guys I\u2019m visiting Tubbo right now - P1\n\n\nTubbo \n| @TubboLive\n&lt;3\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrently Losing It \n| @TamFox\nTubbo and P1 met up? Was it a date..? /j\n\n\nTubbo \n| @TubboLive\nhmmm\u2026\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently Losing It \n| @TamFox\nTubbo???? What does this mean?????\u00a0\n\n...\n\n\u201cHey chat,\u201d Tubbo says. \u201cFor anyone who was wondering about my Tweet, yes, I met Player One. No, I\u2019m not going to be meeting any of the other Players anytime soon. I just want to meet them eventually. One of the Multiplayers is still in America, though, so it\u2019ll be a while.\u201d\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s that. Tubbo opens Minecraft and hops into a vc with Ranboo.\u00a0\n\n\nOr, that\u2019s mostly that.\n\n\nPeople definitely think he\u2019s dating Player one, now.\u00a0\n\n...\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Tommy says. The three of them - plus Wilbur - are standing in the recording studio. Someone has already walked them through how everything works (for over an hour, seriously) and now they\u2019ve been left alone to figure things out. Wilbur has experience with this already, and Tubbo and Tommy have both been to this studio before (though they weren\u2019t allowed to touch much that time), so Tubbo isn\u2019t too worried that they\u2019ve been left to their own devices.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Ranboo says, looking around the studio. Tubbo spins, taking it all in. He \n\nnever \n\nthought he\u2019d ever be here. In a recording studio \n\nand \n\nin this position: lead singer and keys player in a well-known band who\u2019s about to make their own EP.\u00a0\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know why he says it. Maybe it\u2019s the high of being here or the excitement he feels being surrounded by his friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI want to tell people.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s like time stands still. Nobody says anything. Nobody moves. The air is so thick that Tubbo thinks he might very well be choking on it. Fuck. He shouldn\u2019t have said that. What was he thinking? God, he doesn\u2019t want to be the reason that the band falls apart.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat, uh,\u201d Ranboo is first to speak, \u201cwhat do you mean by \n\npeople?\u201d\n\n\n\nFuck it. This is what he wants. \u201cEveryone.\u201d\n\n\nTubbo watches as Ranboo sucks in a breath and exchanges an apprehensive look with.\n\n\nOkay. Maybe he should backtrack. Tell them it\u2019s a joke and forget about it. This was a mistake.\u00a0\n\n\nA hand lands on his shoulder. He jumps, startled. It\u2019s Wilbur. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down,\u201d he says, pulling out one of the office chairs in front of the mixing equipment for Tubbo. He grabs the other office chair for himself and gestures to a small armchair for the others.\u00a0\n\n\nTubbo sinks into the chair, grateful to be off his feet. He fears that if he\u2019d been standing any longer, he would have fallen over. The others squeeze themselves onto an armchair. It\u2019s really not built for two people, both of whom are at least six feet tall, but they make it work.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Wilbur says, \u201cTubbo, why don\u2019t you explain to the others what you mean.\u201d\n\n\nLooking at his friends, Tubbo finds that they seem ready to listen. \u201cI want to tell everyone. To do a \n\nface reveal \n\nor whatever we\u2019ve been calling it. Hiding has just been so- so \n\ndifficult \n\nrecently.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Ranboo says. Wait-\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tubbo asks incredulously. \n\nRanboo \n\nagrees?\n\n\n\u201cReally. It\u2019s hard enough keeping one secret identity,\u201d okay, that makes a lot of sense, actually. \u201cAnd like, we\u2019ve already established ourselves as a good band, I guess, so we know we\u2019ve got a following even without our streaming audiences.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTommy?\u201d Wilbur prompts. Everybody looks to the boy in question. The studio is quiet and then-\n\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Tommy jumps up and flees the room.\n\n\n\u201cTommy!\u201d Ranboo calls, beginning to stand.\n\n\n\u201cNo, wait,\u201d Tubbo stands too, holding a hand out to stop him, \u201clet me.\u201d\n\n...\n\nTubbo finds Tommy sitting on a step in the stairwell. He\u2019s hunched over and jittering, one leg bouncing up and down. He startles when Tubbo sits down beside him, but says nothing. A light flickers overhead.\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tubbo nudges Tommy\u2019s knee. He gets no response. They sit there in silence for a few minutes until Tubbo speaks again. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Tommy grumbles, barely audible.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Tommy, we-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou both want to,\u201d Tommy says. Tubbo is still a bit surprised that \n\nTommy, \n\nof all people, \n\ndoesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Tubbo insists.\n\n\n\u201cIt does!\u201d Tommy yells. His voice echoes in the stairwell. \u201cIt \n\ndoes \n\nmatter, Tubbo! I don\u2019t want to be the thing holding you both back!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHolding us- Tommy! You won\u2019t be holding us back! Look,\u201d Tubbo turns slightly, angling his body so that he\u2019s facing Tommy as best as he can. Seriously he says, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to tell anyone unless we \n\nall \n\nwant to, but\u2026 don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll make our lives a little easier?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEasier? Tubbo, we\u2019re going to have even more eyes on us! Even more people talking about us! \n\nCriticizing \n\nus! Everything will- it\u2019ll all come crashing down on us!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want control?\u201d Tubbo shouts.\n\n\n\u201cI- what?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want control of how people find out,\u201d Tubbo explains. \u201cI want to tell people on our own terms before they find out on their own. Before they\u2026 I don\u2019t know, speculate and come to their own conclusions. I want to be in control of our narrative.\u201d\n\n\nTommy\u2019s mouth drops open, but it snaps shut as he sobers. \u201cWe keep messing up, don\u2019t we?\u201d he whispers.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. One of these days, there\u2019ll be no way to cover it up. No excuses to fall back on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd everything will come crashing down anyway.\u201d\n\n...\n\nIt takes them two weeks to record everything to their liking. It\u2019ll probably be another month or two until the EP is completely done, though. Tubbo has to mix the music and keep a semi-normal streaming schedule, and \n\nthen \n\nthere\u2019s all the marketing stuff that the record label wants to prepare for.\u00a0\n\n\nThey\u2019ve told the label their face reveal plan. The label \n\nloves \n\nit.\n\n\nIn their downtime, whenever they aren\u2019t in the recording studio, they vlog. After Tubbo\u2019s accidental Tweet from the wrong account, they decided that streaming together might be a bad idea. It\u2019d be too suspicious. Too obvious. Instead, Ranboo is pretending that he\u2019s still in the States. They\u2019ll release their vlog after the face reveal. It\u2019ll also serve as a \u2018Behind the Scenes\u2019 for their EP.\n\n\nThey eventually settle on a release date for the EP. It\u2019ll also be their face reveal date. It\u2019s far enough away - two months from now - that Ranboo and is going to fly home and then fly back to the UK again for the reveal. His family misses him and he also needs to, you know, finish school.\u00a0\n\n\nTubbo would definitely be more upset about him leaving if he didn\u2019t know he would be returning sometime soon.\u00a0\n\n...\n\n\u201cOh holy fuck,\u201d Tommy joins The Multiplayers\u2019 vc abruptly and without warning. He\u2019s just ended his stream, which Tubbo and Ranboo were both watching together. They were making funny comments but never actually joined Tommy\u2019s vc.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUm, Tommy?\u201d Tubbo inquires.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t chosen a name for our EP!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ranboo says, then \n\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe could just self-title it,\u201d Tubbo suggests. Even before the others turn it down, he finds he doesn\u2019t like the idea.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat about\u2026 RPG?\u201d Ranboo suggests. \u201cFor Role-Playing Game? Because we\u2019re, like, role-playing as Players One to Three? And also because we role-play on the smp? God this idea is not as good as it sounded in my head.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTommy laughs. \u201cYeah, not great,\u201d he jokes.\n\n\nThey run through a few more ideas, including but not limited to: Select Player, Choose Save File, and AFK (because they were away from their keyboards - meaning not streaming or playing Minecraft - while they made the EP).\u00a0\n\n\nThey\u2019re contemplating \u2018Select Checkpoint\u2019 when Tommy suddenly bursts out laughing for absolutely no reason.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tubbo asks. \u201cWhat is it, Tommy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI-\u201d Tommy takes a deep breath. \u201cI had a stupid idea.\u201d\n\n...\n\nThe Multiplayers\n | @TheMultiplayers\nGet ready! \u201cThe Multiplayers: Update 1.0.0 - EP\u201d by The Multiplayers is coming soon!\u00a0\n\n\nThe Multiplayers\n | @TheMultiplayers\n2 months\u2026 -P2\n\n\nThe Multiplayers\n | @TheMultiplayers\nMark your calendars boys! -P3\n\n\n\nThe Feral Boys Interlude:\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nDream\n\n\n added \n\n\nWilbur Soot\n\n\n to \n\nFeral Boys!!!

How the hell did you forget?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d Wilbur sighs. \u201cRight, I\u2019ll tell them we\u2019ve got to change the day-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d Tommy interrupts. \u201cInstead of doing that, why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d\n\n\nTommy explains his idea. Tubbo can feel his own smile growing as Tommy outlines his plan. They\u2019ll have to run it by Ranboo, but he doubts their bandmate will object. In fact, it sounds vaguely like something Ranboo would\u2019ve come up with himself.\n\n\n\u201cYou know, Tommy,\u201d Wilbur says, \u201cyou\u2019re a little bit evil, I think.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s definitely evil,\u201d Tubbo giggles.\n\n...\n\nThe Multiplayers Announce Collab on Their EP\n\nThe faceless band known as The Multiplayers announced this morning that one song on their upcoming EP is a collaboration with mystery artist.\n\nby Todd Wilson\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nFans Excited Over EP from The Multiplayers, \u201cUpdate 1.0.0\u201d\n\nOriginally a cover band, The Mutliplayers have slowly been releasing original songs.

Please tell me in the comments. On another note, stream The Multiplayers\u2019 new EP when it comes out!\nby Amelia Larann\u00a0\n\nRead more\n\n\nIn the weeks leading up to their face reveal, The Multiplayers only release three more covers. Ranboo is crazy busy with lore on the Dream SMP, Tommy and Ranboo are swamped with school, and Tubbo spends most of his time either streaming or mixing their songs. In fact, Tubbo is so busy that the others end up doing two of the covers without him.\u00a0\nTubbo helps with \u201cBugbear\u201d by Chloe Moriondo, singing lead, but the others do \u201cOne Little Lie\u201d by Simple Creatures and \u201cThe Other Side\u201d from The Greatest Showman on their own. Ranboo sings the verses and pre-choruses for \u201cOne Little Lie\u201d while Tommy sings the choruses. For \u201cThe Other Side\u201d, Ranboo sings Hugh Jackman\u2019s parts while Tommy does Zac Efron\u2019s.\u00a0\n...\nTubbo sees the beginnings of the meetup through Twitter and through the occasional Facetime with Tommy. The Americans went to London - obviously, that  is where George is - and while Tubbo is actually in London as well, he can\u2019t let them know that he is. He\u2019s in the studio mixing songs (he\u2019s done as much as he can at home, and the studio has way better equipment, even if he was allowed to take some home with him after their recording sessions).\u00a0\nRanboo has been helping him as best as he can from across the ocean and then from his hotel in quarantine. Tommy had been helping, too, but now that he\u2019s with the Feral boys\u2026\nHe\u2019s not mad at Tommy, obviously. In fact, he\u2019s glad that Tommy is directing attention toward the meetup. It means less attention on Tubbo himself.\nTubbo was sad to have to tell his fans that he\u2019d be taking a week off from streaming, but he knows that it\u2019s necessary if they want to release the EP on time. Thankfully, he\u2019s got a backlog of YouTube videos that he can release, one on his main channel and two on The Let\u2019s Play Channel that he filmed forever ago and just never bothered to edit. Everybody - save for The Multiplayers and the people who know their identities - thinks that Tubbo is doing important family things.\u00a0\nBut finally,  finally, the EP is done. They\u2019re releasing it in a week.\u00a0\nTubbo leaves his hotel feeling as though a huge pressure has been lifted from his shoulders. He\u2019s not far from where everyone else is staying for the meetup. Because it\u2019s such a big deal, and because the Americans are staying for a long time, they opted to just rent a house.\u00a0\nPhil messaged Tubbo earlier in the morning to tell him that everyone was planning to just have a chill day today, which Tubbo is thankful for. He\u2019s rather tired from all the work he\u2019s been doing and he\u2019s not sure that he\u2019d be able to handle meeting everyone in person for the first time  and going into content creation mode immediately.\nHe arrives around midday, struggling slightly to knock on the door when he\u2019s got a duffel bag in one hand and his ukulele in the other. He\u2019s glad he was able to leave his keyboard and synth at the recording studio, but he wanted to bring his ukulele to the meetup just in case. You never know, maybe Wilbur will randomly bust out his guitar and Tubbo can join in. Tommy\u2019s drum set is also already at the recording studio. The label offered one of their sets to Tommy to use so he wouldn\u2019t have to lug his down again, but Tommy wasn\u2019t having any of that.\u00a0\n\u201cTubbo!\u201d It\u2019s Karl who answers the door, flinging it wide open. He immediately takes the duffel bag out of Tubbo\u2019s hands, helping him inside. Everyone else is scattered about in the living room, but they all stand up to greet him.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were just deciding what we wanted to do for lunch,\u201d Phil says once everybody has had the chance to say hello. Tubbo had even gotten hugs from Sapnap and Wilbur (and Tommy, but it was a very subtle, secret hug). \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d\nTubbo does not have any suggestions and they end up just ordering several pizzas. An hour into the meetup and Tubbo is already having the time of his life. He\u2019s eating pizza and having fun with all of his friends. George and Quackity get into a shouting match over the last slice of plain cheese pizza, Jack and Tommy keep \u2018Ayup\u2019ing at each other for literally no reason. At one point, Karl and Wilbur launch into a shitty rendition of \u201cLost and Losing\u201d, which makes Tubbo choke on his laughter and Tommy groan because  why not \u201cMasked\u201d? Through it all, Phil and Dream somehow have a full, mature conversation about taxes or some shit.\u00a0\nGod, Tubbo can\u2019t wait for Ranboo to finally be through with his two-week quarantine. He knows that he won\u2019t be able to spend much time with him until  after their face reveal, since it\u2019s a secret that he\u2019s even in the UK, but Tubbo doesn\u2019t mind.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cThe Multiplayers dropped another cover,\u201d Dream says at breakfast the next morning. From across the table, Tommy sends Tubbo a mischievous grin. This is Part One of their plan. Ranboo uploaded the video about an hour ago.\nIt\u2019s a cover of \u201cBang!\u201d by AJR. Tubbo sings lead and plays keys, as always. Ranboo is on bass, Tommy on drums. Ranboo is also on\u2026 trumpets. Listen, there\u2019s no guitar in the song and Ranboo was apparently in his middle school marching band or whatever the fuck so he offered to do the trumpet bits for Tubbo to layer on top of each other.\nWilbur insists that they watch it on the T.V. screen together. He\u2019s in on the plan - he\u2019s a bit upset that they chose an AJR song. Wilbur doesn\u2019t like AJR - so he obviously wants to see everyone\u2019s reactions at once.\u00a0\nGeorge hits play on the video. It fades from black to a shot of Tubbo\u2019s hands playing the keyboard. As the other instruments get added in, the others show up in other quadrants, but the shots only show their hands playing the instruments. Ranboo is there twice, in one quadrant with his bass and in the other with his trumpet.\n\u201cOh holy shit,\u201d Sapnap subtly raises an eyebrow at Tubbo, who simply smiles wickedly at him and focuses back on the screen.\u00a0\n\u201cAre they revealing their faces?\u201d Karl asks. Tubbo can\u2019t tell if Karl is concerned or ecstatic. From the look of it, Jack  is concerned. So is Phil. Oh right! They never told them the plan. Oops.\u00a0\nAs the song continues, the cameras pan out. Each Player\u2019s background is plain white (they used greenscreens) and they\u2019re all wearing Venetian masquerade/carnival-style masks. Black, hooded cloaks hide their hair. Camera angles help to further hide their identities.\u00a0\nTubbo really likes his mask. It\u2019s green and white, covering only the top half of his face, around his eyes. Ranboo\u2019s is a black and gold bauta mask, covering his entire face. Tommy\u2019s is red and black. It covers most of the right side of his face but only the top half of the left side of his face.\u00a0\nTubbo worries his lip, looking at his friends\u2019 faces for any hints of recognition. By the time the song is almost over and none of them have said anything, Tubbo relaxes.\u00a0\nThe song ends. The Multiplayers in the video all reach up to their masks, as if to take them off, and then-\u00a0\nIt cuts to black.\nOn the screen, in white text, the link to the new Twitch account that The Multiplayers made appears. Under that is the date of their EP release.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Quackity says. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna livestream a face reveal? Is that what this means?\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly what this means,\u201d Wilbur says as if he has no idea that this does, in fact, mean they are going to face reveal live on Twitch.\u00a0\n...\nPhilza\nYou\u2019re going to stream your face reveal???\nWhy did i not hear about this until today?\nJack Manifold\nYeah, feeling a little caught off guard, you guys\nTommy\nFuck\nWe forgot to tell you\nTubbo\nSorry!\nRanboo\nAhahaha\nOops\nPhilza\nJesus christ\nAre you doing a full reveal, Ranboo?\nRanboo\nNah.\u00a0\nI\u2019m gonna put on my mask and glasses and gloves before we turn on the camera\n...\nThe morning of their EP release and face reveal, they upload some of the Derivakat songs that they recorded forever ago. One sung by each of them. It\u2019s Part Two of their plan. Ranboo sang \u201cIn My Head\u201d and Tommy did \u201cWelcome Home\u201d, of course. And, while Tubbo did sing a version of \u201cHoney\u201d, they end up uploading his version of \u201cAin\u2019t No Crying\u201d because they want all of the covers to be directly Dream SMP themed.\u00a0\nThe Feral Boys go, well, slightly feral after they hear the covers. They\u2019re obviously pretty excited that one of their favourite bands did something based off of the Minecraft role-play that they\u2019re all a part of.\u00a0\nThe internet is going pretty crazy, too. There are tons of theories, ranging from The Multiplayers actually being Ranboo, Tubbo, and Tommy, to The Multiplayers potentially getting added to the smp.\u00a0\n...\n\u201cSo,\u201d Sapnap says. He and Tubbo are washing lunch dishes.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Tubbo replies, drying a plate.\n\u201cToday?\u201d\nTubbo grins. \u201cToday.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Sapnap says.\n\u201cAwe. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sapnap gives a small nod. There\u2019s a few seconds where they just go back to doing the dishes. Tubbo puts the plate away and moves on to drying a cup, but he suddenly feels water being flicked into his face.\n\u201cHey!\u201d he screeches, smacking Sapnap with the kitchen towel in his hands. Sapnap just laughs.\n...\nThey bring everyone to the recording studio under the pretense of Wilbur needing to get some short voice recordings of them all for  his next song. He\u2019s apparently going to alter their voices so they sound like instruments. Wilbur\u2019s next song doesn\u2019t actually exist, but the others take the bait.\u00a0\nThis. This is Part Three of the plan.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, I want to get Tommy and Tubbo\u2019s voices first,\u201d Wilbur says, leading them into the live room (where all of the microphones and instruments are), leaving the others in the control room (where the mixing equipment is).\u00a0\nTubbo can only imagine what the others\u2019 faces must look like when Ranboo suddenly enters the live room from a separate door. He\u2019s too busy hugging him -  finally - to look. He checks afterwards, though. They all seem very confused, but Wilbur is blocking them from opening the door into the live room.\nTubbo sees the exact moment that Sapnap notices the streaming equipment. Sapnap gets this huge grin on his face and takes a step away from the window, leaving more room for the others to look into the room.\nThe Multiplayers grab their instruments. The stream has been gathering viewers for a few minutes now. Tommy started it, using the simple \u201cStarting Soon\u201d screen in comic sans that Ranboo made, like, yesterday. Wilbur takes hold of his guitar. The stream is titled \u201cLive Concert Before EP Release\u201d which they all know is an absurdly bland title. They\u2019ve recruited Phil to change it to \u201cNew Song ft. Wilbur Soot\u201d once they actually start playing.\nSomeone knocks on the glass and Tubbo looks up from where he\u2019s making sure his keyboard settings are in place to see Karl holding his phone up so they can see it. He\u2019s got their The Multiplayers stream pulled up, looking at them all questioningly. Ranboo holds a finger up to his mouth to tell Karl to \u2018shh\u2019. Karl, eyes wide at the revelation, turns the phone off and puts it into his back pocket, not letting any of the friends beside him know what he\u2019s just discovered.\u00a0\nRanboo takes off his mask, glasses, and gloves. They\u2019ll impede his singing and playing if he leaves them on. They did some rehearsals in which he wore them and things didn\u2019t work out. He\u2019ll put them back on again just before they turn on the camera. He doesn\u2019t mind his streamer friends seeing his face, though. A lot of them have already seen it, actually.\u00a0\nTubbo hits a button, making the \u201cStarting Soon\u201d sign leave the stream. Their viewers are left with a simple black screen, since the camera is still off.\u00a0\nThey turn on their microphones.\n\u00a0\nRanboo starts playing first. Then Tubbo hits a button on his synth and Ranboo\u2019s pre-recorded electric guitar part begins playing, alongside Wilbur on an acoustic. Tommy comes in next with a quick drum beat. Finally, Tubbo sets his hands down on his keyboard and plays.\u00a0\nAnd then he sings.\n\u00a0\n[Verse 1 - Tubbo]\nRight along beside you\nI can help you fight the monsters.\nBut only if you let me join the game.\nRight along beside you\nI can help put out your fires\nAnd I\u2019ll try my best to ease all of your pain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe song is sort of\u2026 intense. Not in the actual instrumentation, but the- the  emotions.  The feelings you get when you hear it, the feelings Tubbo gets when he sings it. It\u2019s a song from the heart and it\u2019s probably not the  bang  that anybody was expecting from the long-awaited The Multiplayers face reveal but it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s  real.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n[Pre-Chorus - Tubbo]\u00a0\nBut I can\u2019t help you,\nAlthough I want to,\nUnless you let me\nUnless you add me to the game.\n\u00a0\nRanboo and Tommy join him for parts of the chorus.\n\u00a0\n[Chorus - Tubbo, The Multiplayers]\nWill you play the game alone?\nOr will you let me be there too?\nAm I allowed to build you up\nWith blocks right to\nThe sky above?\u00a0\nOr will you keep playing\u00a0\nA multiplayer game\nIn singleplayer?  \u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWilbur takes the second verse, save for the last line, sung by Tommy. It gives Tubbo the chance to look through the glass into the control room. Jack and Sapnap have gravitated toward each other, knowing that they both already know what\u2019s going on. Karl seems to have noticed their knowing looks because he\u2019s slowly inching towards them as well, all the while not taking his eyes off of The Multiplayers.\u00a0\nDream, George, and Quackity all look very impressed and  very confused.\u00a0\nPhil looks proud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[Verse 2 -  Wilbur, Tommy]\nYou\u2019re here right beside me\nSwinging swords against my enemies\nAnd I badly, badly, want to let you in\nYou\u2019re right here beside me\nTaking shots at thoughts that bury me\nOh, I wish to god that you would let me in\n\u00a0\n[Pre-Chorus - Tubbo]\u00a0\nBut I can\u2019t help you,\nAlthough I want to,\nUnless you let me\nUnless you add me to the game.\n\u00a0\n[Chorus - Tubbo, The Multiplayers]\nWill you play the game alone?\nOr will you let me be there too?\nAm I allowed to build you up\nWith blocks right to\nThe sky above?\u00a0\nOr will you keep playing\u00a0\nA multiplayer game\nIn singleplayer?  \u00a0 \n\u00a0\nTubbo likes the bridge. Their playing grows more frantic and their singing becomes quicker and quicker, almost  desperate in tone. It\u2019s a sort of overlapping ping-pong between their lines and Wilbur\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[Bridge - Tubbo,  Wilbur,  The Multiplayers]\nPlease let me in.\nI can\u2019t let you in.\nI know we can win\nWe\u2019ll never win\nPlease let us in\nWe\u2019ll never win\nLet us join the game\nIt\u2019ll end in pain\nInvite us in\nI won\u2019t invite you in\nLet us help you win\nI can\u2019t let you in\nFine!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe music cuts out. For a moment, it\u2019s like nobody breaths. Then Tubbo sings one line, completely alone:\n\u00a0\n\"Don\u2019t let us in.\"\n\u00a0\nIn a broken whisper, Wilbur replies:\n\u00a0\n\n\"Wait\u2026 no.\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe music slowly begins to fade back in, starting with keyboard, then guitars and bass, then finally drums, all growing louder and louder and faster and faster before finally going back to normal as Wilbur starts up the third verse.\n\u00a0\n[Verse 3 -  Wilbur ]\nStanding here beside you\nI think I\u2019m finally understanding\nYou\u2019re not trying to take the controller from my hands.\nStanding here beside you\nI can see it all so clearly now\nAnd I\u2019d like to give this new gamemode a chance.\n\u00a0\nThe final chorus is grand, but also\u2026 intimate, in a way. It feels\u2026 right. Tubbo has no other way to describe it. It feels right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[Chorus - The Multiplayers, Wilbur, The Multiplayers+Wilbur]\nSo you won\u2019t play the game alone?\nAnd you\u2019ll let us be there too?\nAnd we\u2019re allowed to build you up\nWith blocks right to\nThe sky above?\u00a0\nOr will you keep playing-\nI\u2019ll never again play\u00a0\n\n A multiplayer game\n\n\nIn singleplayer.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nRanboo puts on his disguise.\nTommy runs a shaky hand through his hair.\nWilbur steps out of frame.\nTubbo turns on the camera.\u00a0\nThe second he sees Ranboo walk into the room, Karl knows. Or, he thinks he knows. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s right. And then they start grabbing instruments and his theory is all but confirmed.\u00a0 Only, there\u2019s  no way, right?\u00a0\nBut the \u201cBang!\u201d video. Even disregarding the colours of the Players that correspond with his friends\u2019 respective brands, the Multiplayers are supposed to reveal their identities today (not that they ever specified what time they\u2019d be doing it). This all looks a lot like a big reveal set up.\u00a0\nSo, Karl opens Twitch on his phone. He\u2019d gone and followed The Multiplayers just seconds after watching their \u201cBang!\u201d music video (has had nearly a million other people) so he immediately sees that they\u2019re live.\u00a0\nKarl opens the stream. The comic sans \u201cStarting Soon\u201d screen reminds him of Ranboo.\nSubtly, he knocks on the glass in front of him and shows his phone screen to the- the  band  on the other side. Ranboo nods and shushes him. Karl can practically  see the smirk from underneath the mask and glasses.\u00a0\nKarl has no idea what to do with the confirmation that Tommy, Tubbo, and Ranboo really  are The Multiplayers. A hell of a lot of things make so much more sense, in hindsight, from the weird way Ranboo and Tubbo had acted during Karl\u2019s karaoke streams to Tubbo being totally evasive when Karl and Sapnap had been worried about him.\nOh! Sapnap! The day after they had both confronted Tubbo, Sapnap had just stopped worrying. Tubbo must have told him.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Dream blurts. Karl just shrugs, acting just as confused as Dream is. Ranboo had shushed him, but even if he hadn\u2019t, Karl is excited to see the looks on the others\u2019 faces when they inevitably realize what\u2019s happening.\u00a0\nThen finally, the Multiplayers start playing.\nKarls  friends start playing.\u00a0\nKarl has been a fan for a long time. He\u2019s always known how good The Multiplayers are, but seeing them in person,  knowing who they are? It\u2019s mind-blowing.\u00a0\n...\nRanboo is here? And he\u2019s playing a song with Tommy and Tubbo and Wilbur? What the fuck?\nDream is confused. Like, really fucking confused. They\u2019re good - spectacular, actually - don\u2019t get him wrong, but like, why is this happening? When did Ranboo even get here? Since when could they all play instruments so well (excluding Wilbur, obviously)? He knows that Tommy and Tubbo have both talked about playing piano, and Tubbo plays the ukulele, but this on  another level.\u00a0 \nThe song ends. Tubbo and Tommy start talking to the camera - wait, there\u2019s a camera? - but Dream is more focused on the people around him. Phil, Sapnap, and Jack start clapping. Karl sort of does, too, but he looks a little bit stunned.\u00a0\nDream gets startled by Quackity\u2019s whoops and cheers. Quackity doesn\u2019t seem confused at all, just excited. Thankfully, Dream meets eyes with an equally bewildered George. They share a silent \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d with their eyes but it gets cut off by Quackity throwing his arms around both of their shoulders and pulling them together. Dream sees George nearly lose his footing.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should have seen this coming!\u201d Quackity says enthusiastically.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d George asks, genuinely confused.\n\u201cThat they formed a band?\u201d Dream asks. How could they have possibly seen this coming?\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d Quackity grins.\u00a0\n\u201cRight?\u201d Karl joins the conversation. \u201cI mean, looking back on it, it makes total sense that they\u2019re The Multiplayers.\u201d\u00a0\nDream freezes, eyes going wide. \u201cThey\u2019re the  what?!\u201d\u00a0 \nThe room goes silent.\n\u201cUh, mate,\u201d Phil breaks the tension, \u201cyou didn\u2019t realize?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Dream says, defensive, \u201cHow could I have possibly realized?\u201d\n\u201cTheir colours?\u201d Karl offers.\n\u201cTheir general shadiness?\u201d Sapnap adds.\n\u201cTubbo willingly flirting with someone other than Ranboo?\u201d Jack points out.\n\u201cIt was in front of our eyes the entire time!\u201d Quackity exclaims.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Dream gasps. \u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d George says, a smile spreading across his face, \u201cThe Multiplayers collab is with  Wilbur?\u201d\u00a0 \n...\nTechnoblade sees the exact second that The Multiplayers go live. He may or may not have been lurking in their offline chat all day.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s a fan, not that he\u2019ll ever admit it. Their music is really good. Even their covers. And the metaphors! There are so many hidden messages in  all of their songs. As much as he wishes that Tommy wasn\u2019t so (purposefully) obtuse about it, Techno does appreciate that Tommy\u2019s ignorance of the topic gives him the opportunity to talk about and vocally analyze the songs.\u00a0\nThe \u201cStarting Soon\u201d leaves and the screen goes totally dark. The new song starts. They aren\u2019t even through the entire first verse when Techno decides that this is one of his favourite songs by The Multiplayers.\u00a0\nThe song is the only reason that he\u2019s here, so he\u2019s really happy that it\u2019s so good. He really doesn\u2019t give a shit about what the band might look like. He understands the pressure of a face reveal. So, yeah, he doesn\u2019t give a shit.\u00a0\nOnly, when the song ends and a few seconds later the camera turns on, Technoblade decides he gives  several shits.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d He whispers to himself. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\nOh, he\u2019s gonna throttle that fucking child.\n\u201cHi!\u201d Tubbo says on camera, waving at the screen with a big but nervous smile on his face.\n\u201cHello boys!\u201d Tommy says in his signature \u2018starting stream\u2019 voice.\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d Ranboo waves a gloved hand.\nTechno is gonna throttle three fucking children. Jesus fuck.\nThe three Players - these three fuckheads are  The Multiplayers - go around introducing themselves, since there are definitely fans out there that won\u2019t know who they are as Minecraft streamers.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Technoblade books a plane ticket.\nIt only hits him after he\u2019s done packing a suitcase that it was  Wilbur  singing with them.  Wilbur is the collaboration on their EP.\nWilbur Soot was  in on it. \nMotherfucker.\u00a0\n...\nHOLY WHAT NOW?? | @WilteredHoly shit??? I was right???\nMaya Dean | @M_ayaDeanHuh?

It\u2019s both okay to like them even if you don\u2019t know them for anything but their music //\nNick Halden | @NotCaffreyand if you already liked them as streamers but we should respect their wishes to keep streaming/youtube/minecraft separate from their music\nNick Halden | @NotCaffreyHere\u2019s a clip of them talking about it in case you missed it(boundaries - clip)\n\u00a0\nErik | @ranboobooGood morning!

Should I start watching their streams? How hard would it be to catch up on the \u201cdsmp lore\u201d or whatever you call it?\nCurrently Losing It | @TamFoxOh god it would take years to catch up\nErik | @ranboobooDefinitely watch their streams!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKara and Spencer | @ChattingWithKSStill can\u2019t believe that some of the theories about @TheMultiplayers were true!
