    "text": "\nHe ran through the hallways, barely\u00a0breathing as he tried to make as little noise as possible. \n\n\nHe came to a corner and peered around it, his back to the wall. Everything was quiet, the kind of quite that made your ears hurt.\n\nThey were playing a game, they called it a game, it was one he couldn\u2019t win. He played anyway.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he sprinted around the corner, running on unsteady feet. His eyes darted around towards possible escapes or advantage points he could lie to himself about using later. Later in the game, the game he wouldn\u2019t win.\n\nHe came to the end of another seemingly never-ending hallway only to find a dead end. He turned around to look back the way he came, he had paused for too long and needed to go go go now\u2014\n\nClaw like hands gripped at the base of his neck and his breath left him in a second.\n\n\n \"Found you.\" \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGrian fell out of his bed with a shuddering gasp, his body trembling as he tried to regain his foggy mind and unsteady breaths. He blinked sporadically, darting his eyes around the room by habit, looking for a danger that wouldn\u2019t be there, it couldn\u2019t be there. Finally calming down enough to move a little, he sat up against the side of his bed, the cooling glow of his base grounding him as he listened to the ocean just outside his doorstep.\n\n\u2018That was\u2026 Weird.\u2019 \n\nGrian put a hand to his face, rubbing at his eyes as he thought about what he\u2019d just woke up from. He had a dream about the Watchers. When he had first escaped them, he wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye at this sort of thing, but it had been months now, he was starting to go days without even thinking about them let alone having them in his dreams. Knowing how the Universe seemed to have fun messing with him he supposed this wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise. \u2018Plus,\u2019 he rationalized, \u2018it was just a dream, they can\u2019t get to me here.\u2019 Grian laid back down, feeling the cold concrete beneath his head as he tried to relax. Closing his eyes, he felt the pull of the Universe faintly around him, connecting everything to each other. Every player could feel it, even if only slightly, and it tended to make Grian smile on normal occasions, the idea that everything had a purpose and place in the world regardless of what it was.\nThis time however the Universe felt\u2026 disjointed. Not in a bad way, almost if it was preparing something, something big. Grian felt his stomach drop out from under him as he realized what this was.\nThis was an Update.\nOccasionally, when the Watchers would get bored with their games and tricks, they would plead with the Universe for a change. The Universe would oblige, but in return, they were tasked with guiding players into their new worlds. They would guide them however they wanted to and would often make it difficult, but it was the only way for players to access the updates.\nGrian stared at his ceiling as his mind raced. The Watchers didn\u2019t know about Hermitcraft, Grian had made sure of that, but that also meant that the Hermits didn\u2019t know about the Watchers. Which now left the question,\n\nHow were the Hermits going to get to the Update?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the morning the rest of the Hermits had felt the same disjointedness, coming to the same conclusion Grian had, that the universe was preparing for a change. Life, for the most part, stayed the same, construction on the Hermits various projects continued, but no one could deny the buzz in the air. An update was an exciting thing, new items and blocks and mobs, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise that it was a hot topic. Grian tired to keep up with the excitement of it all but found himself falling short, preoccupied with concern over how everything would play out. His natural optimism was calling for him to just relax and assume everything would turn out fine, but when it came to the Watchers he knew better to indulge in that way of thinking.\nA week passed, and the Universe finally fell back into place. Unable to contain themselves, the Hermits ventured out to explore the new chunks of their world. However, what they found instead was a wall.\nA simple transparent wall reaching far below bedrock up past the height limit, trapping them in. They could see the world beyond it, taunting them. At first, they all tried different ways to get past it, Mumbo using a possibly unnecessary amount of Redstone to try and push sections out of the way, while Impulse reworked his Ghast canon to aim it directly at the thing. Despite their efforts, nothing worked, and eventually, the Hermits dispersed back to their bases with nothing but a few more holes in the ground to show for it.\nGrian honestly felt a little bad about not telling the others that he knew how to take the barrier down. He had seen them many times before, they were normally the result of not finding the Update portals in time. Watchers would often leave the barriers up to entertain themselves, laughing at how the players would scramble around trying to destroy it or find the portal the Watchers had left them, Grian never understood what was so amusing about it.\nGrian flew throughout the shopping district lazily, haphazardly following his elytra course as he thought about what to do. He needed to find a way to break down the wall himself with whatever power he had left without drawing attention to himself. His first thought was to try and tear it down late at night when he was alone but decided against it. His lack of practice meant that the spell he\u2019d need to use would end up taking hours to cast and he couldn\u2019t risk being caught. Grian spent the next few days in his base thinking, and it ultimately took flying over Mumbo\u2019s base to finally think of something that might actually work. It would take a little preparation, but it was the best he had, and the other Hermits were starting to get restless.\nLater that night Grian flew out of his base towards Iskall\u2019s home. He knew Iskall would be working on Sahara that night, so it was the perfect place to conduct the first part of his idea, but he\u2019d still need to work quickly. Landing on the icy terrain he swiftly scoped out an area to start building on and set to work. Falling back into the routine of creating a building like this was concerningly easy, at points, Grian found himself subconsciously reaching for blocks he didn\u2019t even have access to. Shaking himself out of his haze he worked faster. Finishing the building itself he made his way inside, placing a few signs before stepping out of the building to look it over. It was a simple tower, made of obsidian and sandstone that clashed harshly with the ice and water surrounding it. It wasn\u2019t too tall, and nothing compared to the ones he had had to make in the past, but it would serve its purpose. Grian took off back to his base, hoping that this would work the way he needed it to.\nTo Grian\u2019s relief, Iskall had called several other hermits to his base once he discovered the tower. Once he arrived he feigned innocents, trailing behind his friends as they all went inside. The inside of the tower was empty apart from two signs, having a date and coordinates written on them. It was easy enough to find the coordinates, leading the Hermits to the edge of the barrier several thousand blocks out. At first, they had tried to figure out who had built the tower, but after no one fessed up the group simply resorted to helping Iskall take down the tower and to wait for the day to arrive.\nWith the date rapidly approaching, the hermits organised what they would do when the time came, deciding that the simplest option was for all of them to meet up at the border and just\u2026 see what happens. Xisuma created a portal for easier access to the location, however, Grian said he\u2019d be making his own way there, the others rolled their eyes at the idea, but they didn\u2019t question it.\nNow that most of the pieces had fallen into place, all Grian had left to do was wait. which proved to be easy than he thought, the days passing by him as he built his flying machine and prepared for the journey ahead. He still couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous, he hadn\u2019t had to use this kind of magic in months, and there was still the possibility of it not even working in the first place. However, Grian refused to let those thoughts get to him, it was too late to back out now, and this might be his only chance to break the barrier himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe day had finally come.\nGrian saw the other hermits off as they entered the Nether portal, waving them goodbye before he made his way back to his own mode of transport. He got into the flying machine and just sat there for a moment, preparing himself up for the long journey ahead of him. He\u2019d need to use the next few hours to concentrate on the spell and make sure he had enough magic to cast it, so with one final wave to his base, he flicked the machine on and closed his eyes.\nWhen Grian heard the other hermits\u2019 voices from below him, it caught him off guard, he snapped his eyes open to see the barrier in front of him approaching slowly. The last few hours had definitely helped, the air felt almost electric, he could feel more magic surrounding him now than he had in months,\nBut he had no idea if it was going to be enough.\nPanic squeezed suddenly at his heart, he attempted to not let it show on his face as he watched some of his friends fly around him. He could hear himself say something about ramming into the barrier. He thinks it was meant to be a joke.\nHe shoved his shaking hands into the sleeves of his jumper and clenched his eyes shut, he reached out almost desperately for something, anything. Feeling magic swell around him he opened his eyes to see the barrier only a few blocks ahead now.\nIn one more frantic grasp for help, he pulled against the universe with wild abandoned and yanked at anything it had to offer him, digging his fingernails into the palms of his hands he braced for impact. He had no idea why he thought this would work why did he try to\u2014\nGrian felt something\u2026 snap,\nA rush of magic crashed into him, almost knocking him forward. He felt the hairs on his arms stand up as he tried to control this power he didn\u2019t even realise still existed, and for horrifying a moment he was reminded of what it was like to be a Watcher. Gritting his teeth, he focused towards the barrier in front of him, finally releasing the energy towards it, feeling it spread and crackle across its surface before it finally fell.\nGrian could faintly hear the other Hermits cheering around and below him, glancing up as they flew off ahead into the new world. He took a moment to sit back and catch his breath, suddenly finding himself incredibly tired. Curiously, he reached out again to see if he could feel the magic that had been coursing through him seconds ago, but there was nothing, whatever magic he had left had been used to destroy the barrier, and even then, it barley scarped by. At that moment though Grian found that he didn\u2019t really care, the wall had come down and his friends were already ages ahead of him. Shaking off his drowsiness with a small grin, he turned the flying machine off and took off after them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSomeone ran down a hallway. \n\n\nCrashing into a door and forcing it open, they looked up at the person inside, who frowned at the intrusion.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought I told you I wasn\u2019t to be disturbed\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe found him.\u201d\n\n\nSilence rang throughout the room as the two figures looked at each other for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, no random player would be able to harness enough magic to take down a barrier all by themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere was he hiding?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s a completely random world. Nothing special about it. He had it blocked from our vision this whole time with some sort of shield, but somethings finally broken it.\u201d\n\n\nThe creature grinned, their smile too large and teeth too sharp,\n\n\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll just have to go see what we\u2019ve been missing out on, won't we?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe update was messy, to say the least.\n\u00a0\nAt first, everything seemed fine, after a few minutes of looking the hermits were able to find a nice little village to set themselves up in and villages to room with, laughing at how ridiculous they looked with player heads on. Grian could feel himself relaxing, watching the commotion around him as the others built their houses and talked amongst themselves. Maybe everything was going to turn out fine, if anything he was proud of himself for being able to give this to his friends, even if they didn\u2019t know he was the one to take down the barrier.\nThen the lighting started\u2026 glitching.\nThe hermits that hadn\u2019t migrated to the village noticed it first, placed torches and glowstone no longer giving off any light despite being lit, it could be fixed by placing a new light source but eventually, those ones would die out too. Anyone looking at it for too long would get a headache trying to work it out. The new pillagers were also an issue, spawning at an almost uncontrollable rate. It was like every time a raid finished a new one would start on the opposite side of town, making Hermitville feel more like a war zone than a home away from home.\nGrian watched as Doc and False finished off the last few invaders from the top of his house, cheering as False struck the final blow and ended the raid. He jumped down as they walked over, both clearly worn out from the fight.\n\u201cYou could have come and helped us out you know.\u201d Doc huffed, dropping onto the steps of Grian\u2019s house.\nGrian laughed, handing him some pork, \u201cI don\u2019t know man, I wouldn\u2019t want to show you up with my amazing fighting skills. Plus, I threw a trident at some point.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you mean one you hit me with?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! That one!\u201d\nFalse sighed, rolling her aching shoulder as she unequipped her sword, \u201cI don\u2019t get why they\u2019re showing up so often, it doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m normally down for a good fight now and then, but this is ridiculous.\u201d\nGrian nodded in agreement, handing her some water that she gulped down quickly. The trio sat in silence for a moment, enjoying the quiet around them. The peace didn\u2019t last long though, the sound of fighting suddenly breaking through the air from the other side of the village. False groaned loudly as she took her sword back out and gave Grian the now empty water container,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! Are these raids ever going to end?\u201d She started sprinting down the path towards the sound of battle, Doc following quickly behind her. Grian called out after them,\n\u201cDo you want help?\u201d\n\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about it, dude! We\u2019ve got this!\u201d Doc shouted back, turning the corner and leaving Grian alone on the now-empty Sahara street.\nGrian quickly took the sky, not wanting to get caught in the middle of the fight. Watching the world speed past around him, his thoughts couldn\u2019t help but drift to how weird everything had been the last few days. Nothing like this had ever happened before, nothing on this scale at least. The Universe was still trying to reconnect itself after such a massive change, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise that a few things still didn\u2019t work quite well yet, but this was on a completely different level. Hermitcraft didn\u2019t just feel disconnected from the update, it felt detached. Grian grimaced, shaking the thought out of his head, he\u2019d just have to trust that the Universe would put itself back together eventually.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d only landed in his base for a few seconds before he heard his communicator go off. Pulling it up he looked at the message,\nGoodTimesWithScar: Hey Sherlock, come solve a case for me?\nGrian grinned, quickly grabbing his detective gear before flying out of his base again towards the shopping district. Landing in front of 221G he saw Scar leaning against the front of the building, smiling up at him from beneath his hat. Grian cleared his throat, popping up the collar of his coat as he addressed his friend in his attempt at a professional tone,\n\u201cI knew you were going to message me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d expect no less from the incredible Sherlock Grian.\u201d Scar chuckled, leaning away from the wall to walk towards the \u2018detective\u2019.\nGrian, trying to keep up his professional character and failing, gestured towards the door, \u201cHow about we talk inside my office?\u201d\nOnce the two men were inside Grian sat behind his desk, leaning back into his chair as he peered at Scar.\n\u201cSo, Mr Goodtime, what\u2019ve you got for me?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Scar began, \u201cIt started when I was scoping out areas to try out the new crossbows I had made, I\u2019m thinking about making some kind of store so I wanted to see what I could do with them-\u201d\n\u201cRight yes, Concorp\u2019s going to start selling weapons, hurry it up, I\u2019m very busy.\u201d Grian interrupted, rolling his eyes.\nScar let out a laugh, \u201cOh I\u2019m sure you are. Anyway, to make a long story short, I found something I think might interest you.\u201d\nGrian cocked his head, leaning forward to rest his arms on the desk in front of him, \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d\nScar tilted back, gesturing his head towards the window. \u201cCome with me and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\u201cAhh, keeping it a mystery, are you? Well, consider me intrigued. Lead the way!\u201d Grian stood from behind the desk, flinging the back of his coat dramatically as he did so. Scar turned towards the back of the room before hesitating for a moment.\n\u201cHow do you\u2026 how do you actually get out of here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOne broken window later, the duo stood out the front of a cave entrance. Venturing forward, Scar lead them both down a series of tunnels, placing and breaking torches as they went in an attempt to fix the lighting somewhat. After a few minutes of this, they reached a large opening, the ceiling stretching far above them, chests and shulker boxes dotting the area randomly.\n\u201cScar if all you\u2019ve brought me to see is a cave, I\u2019m going to charge you extra.\u201d\nScar huffed, \u201cNo- it\u2019s just in the next room, trust me, this is worth your time.\u201d\nScar continued to the other side of the cave, Grian following close behind. The next room was dark, despite the torches, which was nothing new at this point.\n\u201cGive me a sec, I\u2019ll light this place back up.\u201d Scar walked ahead into the dark, leaving Grian at the entrance. Squinting his eyes, he tried to look into the room, barely able to see his own hands in front of him. Scar placed a torch down, and Grian could finally see what was on the other side of the room.\n\u00a0\nHis heart stopped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWeird right? At first, I thought it was just someone\u2019s broken Nether portal but the fact that there\u2019s bedrock everywhere makes me think it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrian couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the symbol in front of him, it was like something had blacked out everything else in the room, in existence, and all that was left was him and the Watchers portal sitting right in front of him how was it there\u2014\n\u201cGrian?\u201d He flinched away from the sudden hand on his shoulder, Scar\u2019s concern cutting through his panic, \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m- no, yeah no I\u2019m fine, sorry, uh-\u201d Grian stuttered, shaking his head, calming himself down the best he could. \u201cSorry, the\u2026 the bedrock kind of caught me off guard, I guess.\u201d\nGrian grimaced slightly at the awful excuse. Scar seemed to accept it however, walking back over to the portal (Grian couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy as he did so, despite the fact that the portal was obviously inactive).\nOblivious to Grian\u2019s tension, Scar looked around the area, pointing at the bedrock on the walls and floor.\n\u201cOnce I found this place I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, cause we\u2019re still way above bedrock level you know? My first thought that it was some kind of update glitch, but it looks too man-made for that to really make sense.\u201d Scar turned back to face Grian, \u201cAny ideas on what it could be?\u201d\nGrian blinked. Oh right, the detective thing. It felt kind of out of place now, but he still attempted to keep up the Sherlock act, if not to stop Scar from suspecting anything was wrong then to keep himself from spirally into the panic he could feel still bubbling just below the surface.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Grian began, hiding his trembling hands behind his back, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely right about this looking man-made. The way the bedrocks been placed doesn\u2019t look anything like how it naturally spawns, plus the obsidian itself is a dead giveaway. Apart from that though we still don\u2019t know who could\u2019ve done this, and how.\u201d Grian paced around the room, stopping in front of Scar. \u201cThis is definitely something worth looking into.\u201d\nScar grinned, \u201cSo you\u2019ll take the case?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! This mystery is in good hands, if I could figure out you were the Jangler, I can definitely figure out who\u2019s learned to break and use bedrock.\u201d\nScar snorted, raising an eyebrow at him as he walked towards the entrance, \u201cSure, sure. Well thanks for coming to look at it regardless, I\u2019m gonna be honest finding this thing all by myself was kinda freaky at first, it feels... ominous or something for some reason.\u201d\nGrian glanced behind him at the portal as he followed Scar out of the room, \u201cYeah\u2026 I guess I can see what you mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGrian tripped as he landed back in his base, not bothering to stand up he tore his scarf off his neck, trying to control his breathing. All his fear broke through to the front of his mind at once now that he was alone, he felt like he was drowning in his own thoughts.\nHow was there a Watcher portal in Hermitcraft? How on earth did they even find him? When did this even happen?\nHe reached out to try and feel the shield he had up around the world but felt\u2026 nothing. Clenching his eyes shut he tried again, but no matter where he looked, there was nothing there. The magic separating the two worlds had completely disappeared. He thought back desperately, trying to figure out what could\u2019ve caused this-\n\u00a0\nOh.\n\nOh.\n\nThe update wall.\nThat wave of magic he felt.\n\nHe had used the protection spell to take it down.\n\n\u00a0\nGrian almost laughed at the fact that he had unknowingly used one barriers magic to take down another, but instead, he pushed the palms of his hands into his watery eyes, sighing heavily. There was no way to put the shield back up now, that magic was gone with the barrier and the Watchers were already here. He\u2019d finally been caught.\nNow all he could do was wait to see what they\u2019d do.\n\nSwords clashed together, flinging sparks into the dense, blazing air of the battlefield. Hundreds of bodies laid dead or unconscious, trampled on by others that would surely join them soon in a desperate attempt to gain ground. It was hard to see who was even on what side, not that it mattered in the end, no one would come out of this fight with any kind of glory.\n\n\nGrian watched the chaos unfold from a hill, head rested on his hand and heart heavy in his chest. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost beautiful in a way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\nGrian grimaced, turning his head away from the Watcher next to him. Even sitting their form dwarfed him in comparison.\n\n\n\u201cWhich side do you think will win?\u201d The Watcher continued lightly, their attempt to start conversation falling flat as Grian remained silent, blankly watching the fight rage on in front of him.\n\n\nAfter a moment the Watcher sighed, disappointment heavy in their tone. They stretched, arms reaching out unnaturally far in front of them before they got to their feet, wings ruffling slightly at the movement. They looked down at Grian, his skin crawled as he felt their stare on the back of his head.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you brought me here.\u201d Grian huffed, snapping his head up towards the looming figure standing over him. The Watcher didn\u2019t react to the angry tone, they simply smiled, almost sympathetically. Mouth stretched too wide over their teeth for it to look anything but unsettling.\n\n\n\u201cTo prove a point.\u201d The Watcher soothed, crouching back down next to Grian, fast enough to make him flinch back. \n\n\n\u201cWhy do you think they\u2019re fighting?\u201d\n\n\nGrian frowned, eyes flickering over the war-torn ground still rampant in front of him suspiciously.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNeither do they,\u201d the Watcher chuckled, sickly sweet and nauseating, \u201cthey\u2019ve forgotten what it is that started the feud, simply fighting for the sake of it, the sake of a cause they\u2019ve put all their reliance into despite gaining nothing but death and destruction in return.\u201d\n\n\nGrian resisted the urge to roll his eyes and the flowery language, \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d\n\n\nThe Watcher was silent for a moment, despite the mask Grian could tell he was being observed intently.\n\n\n\u201cWhen this world began, the players that inhabited it cared for each other. They helped one another in times of need, they shared what they had for the good of everyone. Then, they started fighting, arguing over small insignificant things. They let it spiral, corrupting them and their world until it swallowed them whole, and now, they will continue to fight until they wipe themselves out. Rather dying than try and regain the peace they once had.\n\n\nWe have not interfered with this world. We did not \u2018manipulate\u2019 them, nor push them in any direction, instead, we watched them destroy themselves without us.\u201d\n\n\nThe Watcher touched Grian\u2019s cheek gently, turning him to face them before continuing,\n\n\n\u201cThis is what happens without us, Grian. Without us, players would tear this universe to shreds with their greed, and their anger, and their vengeance. One day, when you understand why we do what we do, you\u2019ll thank us for saving you from the inevitable destruction your world would have fallen into.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian opened his eyes slowly.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t panic, not this time. He\u2019d gotten used to the Watchers haunting his dreams now, finding the portal a few days ago had increased them ten-fold. He sighed, touching his face, he could still almost feel the Watchers hand on his cheek. Sitting up in his bed he glanced around himself, he was in his village house, still messy and under construction. His villager roommate stood on the other side of the room watching him, Grian wasn\u2019t sure if he had even slept.\nSilently he rose out of bed, stretching the best he could in the cramped space before walking to the door. He ducked under the doorway and walked outside. He rubbed his arms, shivering slightly at the chill in the air, it was still early, the sun only just rising over the horizon, a slight fog rolling through the village. Grian stood outside his door for a second just enjoying the quiet morning around him, he wasn\u2019t sure if any if the others were awake yet, if they were even in the village in the first place.\n\u201cHey dude!\u201d\nWell. That answered that. The peaceful moment was broken by his Swedish neighbour walking over to him, a grin too wide on his face for how early it was.\nGrian smiled back, \u201cHey man.\u201d\n\u201cMumbo and I were going to head over to Sahara for a bit and see if we could work on the interior, I think he\u2019s already over there if you\u2019d like to come.\u201d Iskall offered, grinning invitingly.\nGrian wanted to say yes, he almost did.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry dude,\u201d Grian sighed, sheepishly, \u201cI\u2019ve got a ton of other stuff I need to get done today and I don\u2019t have any time.\u201d\nIskall\u2019s grin fell slightly, \u201cYou sure? It\u2019s been a while since the Architech\u2019s have all been in the same place at once\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNah, I trust you guys not to ruin anything too much.\u201d Grian reassured, punching his friends\u2019 shoulder playfully. Iskall laughed, breaking the tension in the air,\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t speak too soon dude; it\u2019s going to be your own fault if you hate what we come up with.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you guys won't mess it up too horribly.\u201d\nBefore Iskall could reply, his communicator buzzed. He took it out of his pocket to check it,\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta get going, Mumbo has no idea what to build without one of us being there.\u201d\nGrian snorted, waving his friend off as he walked towards the portal. Once Iskall was out of sight Grian\u2019s face fell, his arms coming up to wrap around himself in some kind of comfort.\n\nHe needed to leave Hermitcraft.\n\nNow that the Watchers had found him, he needed to get out as fast as he could. He couldn\u2019t let the others get caught up in his mess more than they already had and he\u2019d never forgive himself if any of them got hurt because of it. The best thing he could do, he justified, was cut to himself off from everyone. Not completely, but just enough that when he\u2019d leave, they wouldn\u2019t miss him that much. Grian could feel himself getting choked up at the idea, he didn\u2019t want to leave this world, he didn\u2019t want to leave his friends and his life he\u2019d made here but, once again, he didn\u2019t get a choice.\n\u2018History\u2019s repeating itself.\u2019 He thought bitterly as he walked back inside his house. He felt the same wave of grief he always did wash over him as he thought of his old world, of Evolution. He shook his head, trying to get rid of the thought, he couldn\u2019t let himself spiral down that line of thinking now. He needed to get to work. He walked to the corner of the room, breaking a block in the floor to reveal a ladder leading down into the darkness, he climbed down it into a room far under the surface. The stone room was large and empty, the only thing in it being some chests near the ladder.\nIf Grian wanted to escape, he\u2019d need to find a way to get his magic back. The last of it had died with the Update, and this room was a way for him to try and get as much of it back as he could without the fear of being caught. In theory. If any other hermit found it, he could just brush it off as some kind of continuation of his house. Grian walked to the middle of the room, closing his eyes and holding his hand out in front of him. He reached out around himself, trying to feel for any kind of energy that might still be lingering in the world. After a few minutes of nothing he huffed and opened his eyes, trying to relax. Grian took a few deep breaths and closed his eyes again, feeling the universe around him, feeling its connection to everything and everyone, even stronger now with his protection spell broken. He held onto that feeling, clinging to it and following its path, feeling it swell around him\u2014\n\nWoosh\n\nGrian\u2019s eyes flew open, looking at his hand, now alight with purple flame. The glow of it illuminated him. It was small, just fitting in the palm of his hand, and it flickered and died out in a few seconds, leaving Grian suddenly exhausted, but he smiled anyway.\nHe still had a chance.\nGrian had been in his underground room for a few hours before his communicator went off,\n\u00a0\nJoehillssays:  hey y'all, I hate to interrupt all the incredibly important work everyone\u2019s doing at this very moment, but we have a bit of a large building situation where I currently am.\nJoehillssays:  So, you should all probably get over here quickly.\nJoehillssays:  Please.\n\u00a0\nJoe posted his coordinates, and Grian weighed up whether he should go or not. He\u2019d been underground for a good part of the day and had made a lot of progress, plus Joe seemed to think whatever he was talking about was urgent enough that every hermit needed to be there. Grian wrote back a quick I\u2019m on my way before he climbed back up his ladder.\nGrian saw what Joe had been talking about long before he landed, a majority of the other hermits already there. It was an enormous structure, hundreds of blocks high and hundreds of blocks wide, obsidian and bedrock decorated its exterior. It was a beautiful building, intricately detailed with sandstone stairs and slabs and just about every other block possible. Two stone statues stood at its door, tall and regal in appearance, the wings on their backs stretched outwards towards the sky, casting a shadow onto the players gawking up at them.\n\u201cWho\u2026 who built this?\u201d Cleo muttered, walking closer to the door, neck strained up as she took in as much of the building as she could.\n\u201cSee that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Joe stated, \u201cI was here no more than ten minutes ago gettin\u2019 sand, right? I went to go put it away but when I came back this thing had just erupted itself from the ground.\u201d\nCubs brow furrowed and he looked at the man standing next to him, \u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea, all I know is I\u2019ve gotta go somewhere else to get sand now.\u201d\n\u201cThis is bedrock,\u201d Cleo interrupted, drawing the rest of the groups' attention back over to her, \u201cHow\u2019s it got bedrock up here? We aren\u2019t even underground.\u201d \u00a0\nScars eyes lit up in realization, he looked over at Grian, \u201cDo you think this was made by the same person that made that weird portal thing?\u201d\n\u201cWeird portal thing?\u201d Doc\u2019s eyes shifted between Grian and Scar, confused.\n\u201cI can show it to you later if you want, I found it in a cave somewhere. It had a bunch of bedrock around it even though we were nowhere near the right level.\u201d\n\u201cSo, are we going inside?\u201d False asked, looking at one of the statues uneasily.\nthe door creaked, interrupting the group before anyone could respond. They snapped their heads back to the door, catching a glimpse of Cleo before it shut behind her.\n\u201cGuess so.\u201d Doc chuckled.\n\u00a0\nThe first room they walked into was thin. It was only a few blocks wide and the wall ahead of them was blank, a series of pressure plates spread out before it. Cleo was already standing on one of the plates, looking at the others expectantly.\nThe other hermits stood on the plates, one for each of them. When the last of them stepped on, pistons could be heard activating from the other side of the wall, slowly opening it till it was gone completely. The space was exceedingly larger now, having opened up to reveal a hallway. It was long, long enough that they could barely see the end from where they stood, the inside was decorated just as intricately as the outside, beautiful chandeliers made of obsidian and end rods draped down from the ceiling, reaching down towards the ground like stalactites. the most amazing features, however, were the stained-glass windows, they lined the walls of the hallway, shining colourful light onto every surface in the room.\nThe building was breath-taking, Grian could admit that, but that didn\u2019t stop his stomach from lurching at the sight of it. This had the Watchers written all over it, he could tell that from the moment he spotted it on his flight over, and the level of detail they had gone to for this was not a good sign. Nothing about this was a good sign. Xisuma was the first to start walking, moving slowly towards a chest placed a few blocks in front of them. He opened it and took out a book, seemingly the only thing inside. He flipped through a couple of pages before looking at the front cover, frowning.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ren walked towards him; the others followed behind, still taking in everything around them. X held up the book,\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, I can read the inside fine but whatever\u2019s written on the front is\u2026 weird.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Joe exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s Galactic! Give me a second, I\u2019ll see if I can read it.\u201d\nXisuma gave him the book, Joe read over the cover for a second intently,\n\u201cIt says, The Watchers\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds a bit creepy.\u201d Iskall laughed nervously, his brow furrowed. He edged away from the book a little, \u201cIs someone watching us?\u201d\n\u201cSeems to be what the book is suggesting,\u201d Joe replied, he\u2019d opened the book to the first page, \u201cIt\u2019s not that long, and some of it\u2019s written in rhyme-- Was this book made for me or something?\u201d\nThe others laughed at that. Scar walked over to Grian, nudging him a little,\n\u201cHey, do you reckon the symbol on the front of the book looks like that portal?\u201d\nGrian swallowed, he hoped he didn\u2019t look too out of it. This felt like a nightmare, a complete and total nightmare.\n\u201cI mean, I guess?\u201d he said in a dismissing tone, pretending to look at the front cover carefully.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if we can get a better look at the book later, might be useful evidence.\u201d Scar decided. Grian nodded his head absentmindedly.\n\u201cThese windows are incredible!\u201d Stress awed, walking further down the hallway, \u201cLooks like they tell a story or somethin\u2019.\u201d\nThe rest of the group looked back up at the windows. Stress was right, the windows stretching across the room had illustrations in them, screenshots of a story documented beautify in the glass. They started to walk further down the hallway, trying to piece together the tale. Cleo broke the silence first,\n\u201cWhat it about?\u201d She asked Joe, leaning over his shoulder to look at the book he was still flipping through. Joe pushed his glasses back up his nose, looking away from the book at the girl next to him.\n\u201cWell, from what I\u2019ve gathered, it\u2019s the history of these\u2026 Watcher creatures, something about how they were born out of the universes need to learn about itself\u2026 here, I\u2019ll read you some of it,\u201d He cleared his throat before reading from the page,\n\u201c\u2026the Watchers looked over and cared for their Worlds, guiding players through hard times and rewarding them with gifts when they were deserving. They treated the players fairly; however, they would intervene when necessary to maintain peace. The players looking to them as Gods, worshipping them and thanking them for their divine help.\u201d\nCleo scrunched her nose, watching as Joe flipped through a few more pages, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit egotistical, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\nGrian looked away, trying not to laugh. If the Watchers were trying to gain the Hermits trust they were doing a lousy job so far. He continued to trail at the back of the group, looking at the decor around him, the architect side of him was honestly having a good time looking at all the design that went into everything. The Watchers knew how to make a good building, he\u2019d give them that.\n\u00a0\nGrian\u2019s almost peaceful mood was shattered a second later. His face dropped, and he paused in front of the window that caught his eye.\nThe window was made up of different colours of purple glass, depicting three people. Two taller ones standing on either side of the window framing it, obviously Watchers from the wings and attire, a third smaller one stood between them, almost half the height of the other two. They were dressed the same as the others, but the robe was too large for their body, falling around their feet like a puddle.\nIt was him.\nIt was so obviously him that for a moment he panicked that the others would notice, but that was irrational, he knew that it was him, but to anyone else, it would just look like some kind of\u2026 smaller Watcher. Or something. That\u2019s what he told himself anyway. Mumbo glanced around and noticed Grian\u2019s absence in the group, looking behind him to see where he went. He looked up at the window Grian was staring at, walking back over to it, the other Hermits noticing and following behind curiously.\n\u201cThat one looks like a family portrait or something.\u201d Mumbo squinted up at it, \u201cActually, I think there\u2019s something written up there, won\u2019t be a second.\u201d\nMumbo flew up to the window, he hovered there for a moment reading out the inscription written in the stone below it,\n\u201cIt says, The Saved One.\u201d Mumbo flew back down to the group, \u201cNo idea what that means.\u201d\n\u201cI think I saw something about that in here actually,\u201d Joe started flipping through the book again, \u201cAha! Here we go,\n\u2026 The Watchers, taken with the player and his world, decided mercifully to save him from the destruction it would fall into. They gave him one final task; defeat the Enderdragon. The player succeeded and was ascended from his world to become a Watcher.\u201d Joe frowned slightly as he read further,\n\u201cAfter some time, the player became unsatisfied with this. He believed himself better than the Watchers, cursing them out for their actions and interference within the worlds. He fled, trapping himself in a random world and baring the Watchers from entering, dooming the players that inhabited it from the Watchers guidance as a result.\u201d\nGrian saw red.\nHe followed the group as they moved on, the others curiously listening to more of the writing in the book Joe was reading from, but Grian couldn\u2019t hear any of that now. He tried to keep his face neutral but on the inside, he was seething. His hands balled into fists, hard enough that if he had cared in the moment, he\u2019d be worried he\u2019d break skin. How dare they insinuate that he was some kind of villain in any of this, that he was the one at fault for their actions. None of the other hermits noticed Grian\u2019s sudden foul mood, and if they did, they were too taken with Joes reading to really sense it properly.\n\u00a0\nBefore long they reached the end of the hallway. The corridor opened up to a circular room, a large statue of a watcher standing in the middle, a fountain surrounding it. It held a staff in its hand, glass of all different colours coming from the end of it like lightning, spreading to the top of the ceiling in a magnificent display. Around the corners of the room were chests, each labelled with the name of one of the hermits, the group quickly split off to go find their own chest. Grian dragged himself towards the chest with his name on it, the sound of his friend\u2019s excitement at the gifts they\u2019d been given surrounding him.\nHe opened the chest only to close it again a second later, eyes wide and head whipping around to see if anyone else had seen what was inside. The others were too caught up in their own chests to notice, so he opened it again slowly. The chest was empty apart from one item, a white mask. It covered the top half of a face, the bottom edges on each side coming down to point towards the ground, a Watchers symbol painted on the forehead.\nIt was his mask, the one he left behind when he escaped. He quickly shoved it away in his inventory, telling himself he\u2019d deal with it later, when he was alone. Grian walked back towards the entrance of the room where the others had gathered, all of them talking and bantering amongst themselves, Grian wished he could join in on their enthusiasm. Mumbo turned to him once he walked over,\n\u201cSo, what was in your chest?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, it was a bunch of\u2026 fireworks.\u201d Grian lied, smiling at his friend.\nMumbo nodded, \u201cThis whole thing is still really weird, if you\u2019d have come to me yesterday and told me all of this stuff about \u2018Watchers\u2019 or whatever I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d gone mad but now\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019ve got to believe it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to believe anything really. For all we know this could just be some kind extremely elaborate prank.\u201d Grian countered, avoiding Mumbo\u2019s eyes, looking away down the hallway they\u2019d just walked down.\nMumbo snorted, \u201cRight, yeah, what am I thinking, obviously this is all just to make us looks like fools and is totally worth the effort it would take to pull off this well.\u201d\nBefore Grian could reply, Doc called out over the rest of the group,\n\u201cAlright, last one to the other end of the hallway loses!\u201d\nThe other hermits called after him, scrambling to take off, Iskall flying straight into the side of a wall in his haste causing Cleo to laugh so hard she couldn\u2019t take off all together. Grian grinned, his troubles momentarily forgotten as he pushed Mumbo out of the way to take off after his friends, Mumbo yelling at him as he took off a moment later.\n\u00a0\nXisuma held back, grabbing Joes' arm before he could go anywhere,\n\u201cHey, do you think I could have that book? I wanted to look it over a bit.\u201d\nJoe blinked, \u201cOnly if you promise to be the last one to the end of the corridor now that you\u2019ve kept me behind.\u201d\nXisuma smirked \u201cSure.\u201d\nJoe handed him the book, turning back around to chase after the others. X looked at the book in his hands suspiciously. Something didn\u2019t feel\u2026 right about all this, there were so many questions still left unanswered. Why was this the first time any of them had heard about these \u2018Watchers\u2019? How had they built this building so quickly and without anyone noticing? Were they dangerous? He gripped the book tighter in his hands, face now determined. He was going to get answers.\nSomehow.\nGrian tried to catch his breath, putting his hands on his knees as he bent forward to support himself and also not throw up. His jumper had been discarded and thrown into a corner of the room ages ago, leaving him in a white undershirt that now clung to him. Magic zapped around him, crawling up his arms and snaking around his fingers like lightning, just itching to be released. He wiped at the sweat that dripped down his forehead with a shaky hand and took a deep breath before righting himself.\nIf Grian wasn\u2019t desperate before, he was teetering on the edge of it now. Ever since the temple they found in the desert, the Watchers had been popping up more and more frequently, making little challenges for the hermits and showering them with gifts. They were acting way more generous that Grian had ever seen them act before, but the most annoying part to Grian, however, was the fact that they hadn\u2019t\u2026 done anything yet. Not to say he wasn\u2019t happy his huge and possibly life-and-or-friendship-ruining secret hadn\u2019t been exposed to the masses, it was more the fact that he didn\u2019t understand why they hadn\u2019t exposed it. He\u2019d always assumed that if they ever found him, they\u2019d drag him back kicking and screaming or just\u2026 kill him, but neither of those things had happened yet and it was making Grian extremely paranoid. \nThe builder collapsed into one of the corners of the room, leaning on a chest and half chewing on a golden carrot. He was exhausted, spending the last three days down in his secret room trying to re-teach himself how to do magic had really taken it out of him. He tried to think of the last time he hadn\u2019t been so tired, the last time he\u2019d actually worked on any of his projects, the last time he\u2019d even been back to his base. He\u2019d been so busy trying to find a way out of Hermitcraft that he\u2019d put everything else on hold. Well, almost everything, he still worked on his village house and talked with whatever hermit happened to strike up a conversation with him, but aside from that, he\u2019d almost completely cut himself off from the world.\nHe hated it, he hated hearing about all the fun and exciting things his friends were doing without him, and he hated the disappointed look in their eyes when he\u2019d pass on whatever outing they\u2019d ask him to come on. Grian told himself that it was for the best, if they were able to get by without him now there wouldn\u2019t be any problems when he left for good. They\u2019d be safe, and he wouldn\u2019t be putting them in danger anymore. He pushed himself back to his feet newly determined, opening the chest next to him to put his food away, his hand stopping mid-air as he looked inside. It was mostly empty apart from some food and water, the only thing that looked out of place was his mask that he\u2019d thrown inside days prior. He hesitantly grabbed it, running his thumb along the side as he turned it over in his hands.\nThe Watchers took their masks very seriously. When he\u2019d asked about why they wore them so long ago, they\u2019d told him about how the eyes were the doors to a person\u2019s soul or something, that they could see into the player's souls, but the players were unable and unworthy to see into theirs. It sounded like a load of rubbish when he\u2019d first heard it and it sounded like a load of rubbish now. Holding it again after so long was strange and it felt foreign in his hands, he knew why they\u2019d given it to him. It was a message, it was them telling him he wouldn\u2019t escape them, telling him he\u2019d always be a part of them.\n\u2018Screw that.\u2019\nHe threw the mask back in the chest and slammed it shut, casting it out of his mind. He wasn\u2019t going to let them get to him and he refused to play their games anymore. He let the magic flow back into his body, and with a reinvigorated purpose, he continued on.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nXisuma chewed on the end of a pencil, helmet discarded next to him for the moment as he looked over the pages sporadically thrown around the top of his bed. In the time he hadn\u2019t been working on the church or dealing with some kind of update issue, He\u2019d been going over that book from the temple, trying to make sense of it the best he could. He\u2019d tried to transcribe some of the more important sounding passages on random sheets of paper, but it had quickly gotten a little out of control.\nHe doubted he\u2019d even care about something like this all that much normally, weirder stuff had happened around here, but something about this just didn\u2019t seem\u2026 right. It felt too unnerving, almost threatening in a way. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but his gut was telling him not to trust it at face value. X rubbed his eyes, trying to concentrate on the page in his hand. He jumped when he heard a knock at the door to his right.\nDoc stood in the doorway, a grin on his face, probably because he made X jump, \u201cHey dude.\u201d\n\u2018Hey,\u201d X sighed, his heart still beating fast in his chest, \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d\nDoc strolled inside, idly looking around the empty room, \u201cOh, nothing really, I got bored and you and Grian are the only other people in town right now, so I wanted to come bother one of you.\u201d\nHe sat down on the edge of the bed and picked up one of the sheets of paper. He glossed over the words scribbled on it, eyebrow raising, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just bits and pieces from that book we found the temple, I\u2019m trying to get as much out of it as I can.\u201d\nDoc looked at him confused, sitting further back on the bed and leaning on the wall behind him, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nX\u2019s mouth drew up into a line and he ran a hand through his hair, \u201cI don\u2019t trust it. The Watchers, I mean, there\u2019s so much we still don\u2019t know. Where\u2019d they come from? Why are we only just hearing about them?\u201d He grabbed at some paper next to him, shoving it into Doc\u2019s hand, \u201cLook, it says here that they\u2019re responsible for getting players through updates, yeah? So where were they before this update?\u201d\n\u201cThere was that tower that showed up at Iskall\u2019s base, wasn\u2019t that them?\u201d\nX\u2019s shook his head, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t reckon that was them. If you compare that tower to the other Watcher buildings they\u2019ve made around the place, there\u2019s no connection. They don\u2019t look the same in the slightest.\u201d\nDoc looked at him tautly, \u201cI think you might be looking a bit too much into this man.\u201d\nX huffed, leaning back on the bed, \u201cI know, I know. I just don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think these Watchers are that bad, they haven\u2019t done anything wrong so far, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d X muttered, \u201cI just can\u2019t help it, I don\u2019t want to let my guard down and have something bad happen, you know?\u201d\nDoc nodded understandingly. A comfortable silence lay over the room for a few moments.\n\u201cWhelp,\u201d Doc announced, patting X\u2019s knee as he pushed himself off the bed, \u201cI\u2019m going to go find something else to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna go bother Grian now?\u201d\nDoc barked out a laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do that even if I wanted to.\u201d\nX furrowed his brow, looking at his friend confused, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d Doc raised his eyebrow, \u201cNo one\u2019s been able to get Grian to do anything for days now, if you\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll have a conversation with you for a few minutes before he goes back inside his house.\u201d\nX looked out the window at Grian\u2019s house on the other side of the road, \u201cReally? Why?\u201d\nDoc just shrugged, \u201cNo one really knows, we\u2019ve tried to ask him, but he just says he\u2019s \u2018busy\u2019. He won't even show anyone what he\u2019s working on.\u201d\nX felt a bit guilty at that, had his friend really been acting so strange and he just hadn\u2019t noticed?\n\u201cI\u2019ll try talking to him, he might just be weirded out by everything that\u2019s happened recently\u2026\u201d He muttered, looking back at his friend standing in the doorway.\n\u201cGood luck, he won't even talk to Mumbo properly.\u201d Doc countered, \u201cRegardless, I\u2019ll get out of your hair now. Have fun looking over all those pages, man!\u201d\nThe man walked the rest of the way out of the house and turned the corner, leaving X alone. X frowned once he left, looking back out the window. Now that he thought about it more, he really hadn\u2019t seen Grian around much since the update, and even then, he\u2019d been acting a bit more closed off. \u2018Grian had been acting out of character at the temple too,\u2019 his frown deepened at the thought, \u2018a building like that should\u2019ve excited him, right?\u2019 \nHe shook his head, laughing a little under his breath. Doc was right, he was getting way too caught up in the mystery of all this. X gathered up the papers and shoved them into the book, putting it away in a shulker box next to his bed for another day. Maybe he should give the Watchers the benefit of the doubt? He didn\u2019t know, and at that moment he didn\u2019t care that much. He stood out of his bed, walking towards the door to go distract himself with something for a few hours.\nSomeone knocked on Grian\u2019s door as he climbed up the ladder into his main room. He walked over and answered it, finding Iskall and Mumbo at his doorstep dressed in their golfing attire. Iskall grinned brightly,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going golfing!\u201d\nGrian blinked.\n\u201cOkay. have fun,\u201d Grian attempted to close the door, unable to when Iskall stopped it with his foot. Grian opened it again, brows furrowed. Iskall\u2019s smile didn\u2019t waver,\n\u201cGrian. We\u2019re going golfing.\u201d \nGrian looked over Iskall\u2019s shoulder at Mumbo, his fellow Architech also smiling at him, though his smile looked a little more forced.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Grian began, eyes flickering between them, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 busy?\u201d\nAn awkward silence fell over the trio. Mumbo\u2019s smile edged on anxious,\n\u201cPlease Grian?\u201d he pleaded quietly; his eyes slightly desperate.\nGrian chewed on the inside of his lip, looking between his friends for a few more seconds. He sighed, leaning on the door frame,\n\u201cGive me a sec, I\u2019ll go get changed.\u201d\nMumbo\u2019s eyes lit up with relief, his shoulders relaxing as the tension left him. Iskall clapped his hands together,\n\u201cGreat! We\u2019ll just be out here when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\nGrian shut the door properly now that there wasn\u2019t a foot in the way and rested his forehead on the back of it for a moment. His head was a mess, he wanted to go, he really did, but he felt\u2026 bad about it for some reason. Maybe it was because it\u2019d gotten to the point where his friends had to literally confront him at his doorstep to make him interact with them? He wasn\u2019t sure. Regardless of his feelings, he got changed, pulling his golfing clothes out of a chest and putting them on. Iskall and Mumbo were talking quietly to each other when he opened the door again. They smiled when they saw him, properly this time, and all three walked towards the Nether portal.\n\u00a0\nThe walk towards the Concorp Country Club was quiet, Grian hanging back behind the other two while they talked to each other. Mumbo was not so subtlety glancing back at Grian every few minutes. Grian pretended not to notice. Once they actually got to the golf course and set up, Grian felt his mood improve slightly, he watched his two friends argue over who was going to go first, electing to ignore them and stepping into the water on the first hole to take his shot.\n\u201cHey losers,\u201d Grian interrupted, drawing their attention over to him, \u201cSee ya!\u201d\n\u201cYou bastar-\u201d\n\u00a0Iskall\u2019s comment was cut off as Grian teleported, landing on the green. He giggled to himself and looked over at the red flag, waving in the breeze a few blocks away. Maybe today was going to be fun after all.\n\u00a0\nThe trio had made it through a few holes, Mumbo surprisingly in the lead and not shutting up about it. Mumbo and Grian stood on the green of Hole 8, watching Iskall take his first shot from the ledge above them. They watched him aim his trident in the air, squinting as he drew his arm back--\n\u201cIskall! BEHIND YOU!\u201d Grian shouted.\nIskall had no time to react as the Creeper that crept up behind him exploded, killing him instantly.\nGrian burst into laughter, wrapping his arms around his middle as he keeled forward, Mumbo put his head in his hands,\n\u201cit\u2019s happened again, I cannot believe it happened again.\u201d He muttered, giggling slightly as he listened to Grian lose it beside him. Grian took a few more seconds to stop laughing, wiping tears from his eyes as he tried to calm down,\n\u201cO-Oh my god, my stomach,\u201d He gasped, out of breath, \u201cThat-that\u2019s a penalty, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is! Now we have to wait 10 minutes for him to get back here!\u201d Mumbo groaned, sitting down on the grass under him.\nBoth their communicators went off,\nIskall85: bloody creepers!!!\nIskall85: LOL\nGrian grinned slightly as he sat next to his friend, crossing his legs.\n\u201cShould we go grab his stuff?\u201d Grian asked, squinting up at the mountain above them.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going up there\u201d Mumbo scoffed, typing a message back to Iskall to tell him to hurry up.\n\u201cNeither am I.\u201d\nThe two were silent for a moment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve really missed you; you know.\u201d\nGrian\u2019s brows knitted together, he turned his head to look at the moustached man next to him,\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nMumbo looked at the ground, a small, almost sad smile on his face as he fiddled with the grass in front of him,\n\u201cWell it's just, this is the first time we\u2019ve hung out together in ages. It\u2019s just felt like something was missing with you not around, you know? No one\u2019s been able to get you to come out of your house for ages and I honestly wasn\u2019t sure if you were even going to come today. I\u2019m glad you did though, it\u2019s been fun so far.\u201d\nMumbo paused, thinking about his next words carefully. He looked up at Grian, his eyes full of concern and voice soft,\n\u201cYou know if there is something\u2026 wrong, you can come talk to me, right? Or Iskall, or anyone. We all care about you a lot Grian, and we\u2019ve been trying to give you space but, its been hard watching you try and lock yourself away like this.\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nGrian tried to swallow down the sudden wave of emotions climbing up his throat. He looked away from Mumbo, eyes wide and jaw clenched. He didn\u2019t know what he had expected his friend to say, but it wasn\u2019t that. A silence fell between them and Grian realized he should probably respond,\nMumbo\u2026 I--\u201c\n\u201cDID NEITHER OF YOU COME AND GRAB MY STUFF? ARE YOU FOR REAL?\u201d\nGrian was cut off by an angry shout above them, their Swedish friend having finally made his way back. Mumbo sighed, getting back to his feet, he held out his hand and Grian took it, pulling himself up to his feet as well.\n\u201cSorry man! Neither of us wanted to go back up the mountain!\u201d Grian yelled back up at him, Iskall continued to shout something at them, but the words were lost to the wind.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mumbo turned back to Grian, \u201cJust\u2026 think about what I said, yeah?\u201d\nGrian\u2019s smile strained slightly, \u201cYeah. Yeah, I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d\nMumbo continued to look at his friend for a second. He looked like he wanted to say more, but eventually turned away to look back up at their other friend still getting ready to take his shot.\n\u201cOkay, Iskall! This time, what you\u2019re going to want to do is not die!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMumbo managed to keep his lead up until he accidentally threw his ender pearl in the opposite direction of the flag, adding seven points to his score and making the other two Architech\u2019s poke fun at him for the remainder of the round. Once the game was over and everyone added up their scores, Grian was announced the winner.\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Grian cheered, writing his score on the leader board, \u201cKing of golf!\u201d\n\u201cKing of luck maybe,\u201d Iskall interrupted, putting his tridents and flags into a chest, \u201cYou only won because Mumbo started seeing things at the last hole.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a flag!\u201d Mumbo insisted desperately, \u201cI swear I saw a flag.\u201d\nGrian put his hand on Mumbo\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mumbo, I believe you.\u201d He said in faux sympathy. Mumbo shoved his hand away,\n\u201cOh, piss off.\u201d He chuckled, Grian giggling as he turned to finish putting his items away.\nThe walk back to the Nether Hub was exceptionally livelier than the walk there had been, all three players bantering and laughing amongst themselves. By the time they had made their way back to Hermitville, the sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the peaceful town. The three stood in the middle of Sahara street outside Grian\u2019s house,\n\u201cToday was really fun,\u201d Iskall announced, \u201cWe should do this more often.\u201d\n\u201cOh definitely.\u201d Mumbo nodded, turning to look at Grian.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the builder replied, \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d\nThe three said their goodbyes and parted ways, Grian watched them walk away with a small smile on his face.\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m going to miss them.\n\nThe thought startled him, his smile falling in an instant. He\u2019d completely forgotten about that, he\u2019d forgotten about everything today, too caught up in his friend\u2019s company to even consider his current situation. His mouth drew into a line, thinking back to what Mumbo had said to him earlier,\n\n\u2018if there is something\u2026 wrong, you know can come talk to me, right?\u2019\n\nCould he? Could he really talk to him about\u2026 any of this? Grian shook his head, turning towards his front door. No, he\u2026 he couldn\u2019t, not about this. He cared about his friends, trusted them, and if it had been anything else he would\u2019ve gone to them in an instant for help but\u2026 but this was different. He got to his front door, hand pausing over the handle when he heard muffled voices coming from inside.\n\n\u2018\u2026 we have to talk\u2026 listen to\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\u2018he isn\u2019t\u2026 we can\u2019t know\u2026\u2019\n\nGrian frowned, opening the door to confront whoever was inside his house. Xisuma and Doc stood in the middle of the room, both looking startled by Grian\u2019s entry.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going\u2026\u201d\nGrian\u2019s accusation trailed off and his hand slipped from the door when he saw what Doc was holding.\n\u201cGrian, we need to talk.\u201d Doc said, Grian\u2019s\u00a0mask\u00a0held tight in his fist.\nIt was quiet enough that if you dropped a pin, you\u2019d hear the impact. Grian stood frozen by the door, ears ringing and unable to take his eyes off the mask in Doc\u2019s hands. He felt like he\u2019d been punched in the gut. Xisuma\u2019s eyes shifted from Grian to the mask, flickering between the two hesitantly.\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Grian croaked, finally finding his voice, \u201cWhy are you- How do you have that?\u201d\n\u201cI think the better question is how do you have it, Grian?\u201d Doc challenged, taking a step towards the man before X grabbed his arm,\n\u201cDoc, don\u2019t,\u201d X hissed, turning back to the man by the door, \u201cGrian, please, we just want to talk.\u201d\nHe held his hands out in front of him, like he was trying to calm down a scared animal.\n\u201cTalk- talk about what? I don\u2019t,\u201d Grian stuttered, \u201cWhy are you here? Why are you in my house?\u201d Grian\u2019s voice raised as he spoke, shock wearing off and leaving room for panic to take its place. X looked guilty for a second, lowering his arms a little,\n\u201cListen, ok we just- we came over \u2018cause we\u2019re worried about you, everyone is, and we didn\u2019t realize you weren\u2019t home, so we came inside and saw the ladder in the corner and--\u201d\nGrian stopped listening, whipping his head to the corner of the room where the ladder now stuck out of the floor. His eyes widened, eyebrows drawing together in confusion,\n\nWhat?\n\nHe\u2019d replaced the floor; he was sure of it. He\u2019d double-checked it before he left that morning, he wouldn\u2019t just leave it open like that.\n\u00a0\n\nOh, those bastards.\n\n\u00a0\nGrian felt anger crawl up his throat as he realized what had happened, this was the Watchers, it had to be, they must have re-broken the floor after he left. That\u2019s all they had to do, no big reveal of Grian\u2019s lies and follies, no song and dance or big show for all his friends to watch and learn the truth, in the end all it took was just one broken block and two people in the right place at the wrong time for Grian\u2019s world to start cracking and falling around him. Grian flinched back out of his thoughts, X grabbing his shoulder gently,\n\u201cGrian, are you alright?\u201d\nBefore Grian could respond he noticed Doc looking down at the mask in his hand, raising it towards his face curiously--\n\u201cNo! don\u2019t, don\u2019t put it on!\u201d\nDoc pulled it back away from his face quickly as Grian pushed past X to rush over, trying to grab it out of his hand. Doc raised it above his head and out of Grian\u2019s reach before he could, looking down at the man in surprise,\n\u201cWhy? What is it?\u201d\nGrian attempted to grab the mask, cursing his height as it remained out of reach,\n\u201cIt's--\u201d Grian stuttered and looked Doc in the eyes, shrinking down under the intensity of his stare, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d he choked out, taking a step back when Doc\u2019s eyes narrowed into a glare,\n\u201cOh, cut the bullshit dude,\u201d Doc scoffed, eyebrows turned down and shoulders tense, \u201cYou really expect us to believe this is nothing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d expect my friends to respect my privacy and not break into my house!\u201d Grian snapped back, anger clouding his mind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you gave us a choice! You won\u2019t talk to anybody!\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cGuys, come on, don\u2019t--\u201d X tried to interrupt, voice strained, the other two too caught up in their argument to listen,\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern any of you, you can\u2019t get involved-\u201d\n\u201cOh! So you get to decide what we get involved in?\u201d Doc scoffed, continuing to hold the mask above himself.\n\u201cAbout this, yes! I\u2019m just trying to protect you!\u201d Grian shot back, trembling, the anger clouding his mind thickened with panic as he lashed out.\n\u201cProtect us? From what, Grian?\u201d Doc badgered, \u201cThe Watchers? Is this related to them? Is that why it\u2019s got that symbol on it?\u201d Doc gestured to the mask in his hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t, I--\u201d Grian stuttered, he looked away from Doc and wrapped his arms around himself,\n\u201cDoc, stop--\u201d X pleaded,\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust us?\u201d\n\n\u201cDOC!\u201d\nThe shout snapped Doc out of it, he looked over at X, startled. Grian took the chance to grab Doc\u2019s arm, yanking it down and pulling the mask from his hand. Before the other two could do anything, he dashed for the door, yanking it open and taking off without a second thought. X and Doc stood still for a second in shock before they raced after him, Grian already ages away by the time they\u2019re outside.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nMumbo stood behind the two, concern evident on his face as he watched Grian get smaller and smaller in the distance.\nWe uh,\u201d X muttered, face going pale, \u201cWe might have messed up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrian didn\u2019t know where he was going, he didn\u2019t care, he just kept flying. He couldn\u2019t think straight, thoughts flying past his like the wind, he was going so fast that he had to squint his eyes against it. He was such an idiot, why did he leave it in a chest? Why did he leave it in a chest for anyone to just come and find? He felt his eyes well up, using his rockets even faster now, almost as if he could run away from his feelings that threatened to drown him. Grian was so overwhelmed that it took him a second to realise that he wasn\u2019t even flying anymore, he was falling. Eyes widening, he tried to use another rocket, only then realising he\u2019d run out, he felt his stomach drop as he plummeted into the ocean below him, hitting the water like a brick and having the air knocked out of him. His ears rung as he tried to figure out which way was up, eventually kicking his way to the surface. He looked around him, noticing that he was only a little ways off from his base, and started swimming in the direction of it, mask still clenched in his hand.\nHe dragged himself onto the ring surrounding the main build, collapsing for a moment and trying to regain his breath. He hauled himself up a second later, hurrying inside. He was still running on adrenaline, thoughts darting around his head a mile a minute,\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t stay here\u2019\n\nThis would be the first place the others would look, he couldn\u2019t face them right now, not yet, he was still too overwhelmed, he needed to think- he just-\nSqueezing his eyes shut he took a deep breath in and out. he tried to think rationally, tried to think of a place he could go for a little bit to get away from\u2026 everything.\n\u00a0\nMumbo flew around frantically, looking for his friend. He still didn\u2019t really know what was going on, or what had happened, just that X had asked him to go find Grian and to make sure he was safe. That really didn\u2019t sit well with Mumbo, the idea that Grian wasn\u2019t safe in some way, but X\u2019s eyes looked desperate under his helmet and Doc looked guilty beyond all belief, so he obliged without a second thought. Racing over the shopping district towards Grian\u2019s base, he tried to think of where he could be, he didn\u2019t expect the hermit to be at his base, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check. Landing inside the tower he started his search, he flew up around the upper levels and down below, finding nothing. He stood on the ring outside and rubbed his face, sighing. Grian wasn\u2019t here, and if he ever was, he\u2019d left before Mumbo had arrived. The Redstoner looked out at the water, waves crashing into the side of the tower,\n\u2018Where else could he be?\u2019\nHis eyebrows rose as he thought of something, it was a stretch, but\u2026 he might be there. Walking over to the edge of the building he jumped into the water, swimming around towards Grian\u2019s first base.\nReaching the pirate ship, Mumbo swam around it, noticing something red through the foggy glass.\n\u2018Oh, thank goodness\u2019 he thought in relief, quickly making his way over to the front of the bottle and swimming inside. He shook the water out of his hair, looking to the back of the ship at his friend. It was quiet, the water surrounding them silencing any outside noise, and Mumbo suddenly found himself nervous. Grian was facing away from him, curled into himself on the top of the ships roof, the redstoner swallowed his nerves and stepped towards him lightly, he was sure the builder had noticed him, but just in case he hadn\u2019t he cleared his throat, trying to alert him. When Grian didn\u2019t respond he walked a little closer, climbing up to the same level as him.\n\u201cGrian?\u201d he prompted quietly, still Grian made no sign of acknowledgment. Mumbo was only a few blocks away from him now, he rubbed his hands together anxiously.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Grian whispered, so quiet that Mumbo almost didn\u2019t catch it. Mumbo took a quiet breath, relieved that he was at least now getting a response.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked, Grian didn\u2019t respond this time, instead he curled up on himself more. Mumbo continued,\n\u201cGrian, I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your head, or what\u2019s happened to make you think you can\u2019t talk to us but\u2026 please, please tell me what\u2019s going on? Whatever it is, you don\u2019t have to face it on your own, you have so many people that care about you and want you to be safe and happy and--\u201d\n\u201cStop, please just--\u201d Grian forced out, putting his head in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t deserve this, I-\u201d\n\u201cYou do! Grian you\u2026\u201d Mumbo trailed off; brows furrowed in concern over his friends\u2019 words. Silence stretched over the ship for a few seconds,\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lying to you all.\u201d Grian muttered, voice hollow, \u201cI\u2019ve been lying to you all and I\u2019m putting you in danger.\u201d Mumbo\u2019s heartbeat sped up, he\u2019s finally talking,\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He replied, urging him on.\nGrian turned to look at him, Mumbo was taken aback slightly at the expression on his face. His eyes were damp and face stony, dark bags under his eyes. How long had they been there? Mumbo thought to himself guiltily, His thought was cut off when Grian spoke again.\n\u201cI\u2019m a Watcher.\u201d\nMumbo blinked. Grian looked straight into his eyes, not backing down despite the way his hands shook. He was\u2026 what?\n\u201cWhat\u2026 are you--\u201d\n\u201cI came to your world by accident. I put up a shield to block the others off from finding me, but I broke it and now they have.\u201d Grian\u2019s voice was neutral as he spoke.\nMumbo didn\u2019t know how to respond; he didn\u2019t understand what Grian was trying to say. Despite this, he still needed to comfort his friend,\n\u201cGrian I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about but, I\u2019m sure whatever\u2019s happening can\u2019t be dealt with alone--\u201d\nMumbo was cut off again, Grian huffing in frustration as he got to his feet, turning to look at Mumbo properly,\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand! None of you were meant to find out! none of you were meant to get involved! This doesn\u2019t involve any of you and it never should of! I should\u2019ve never come here, I\u2026\u201d Grian trembled as his voice faltered, \u201cI should\u2019ve known this wasn\u2019t going to work, but I was stupid.\u201d\nMumbo\u2019s jaw clenched as he listened to his friend ramble on. He thought about his next words carefully,\n\u201cWell\u2026 Lucky for you Grian, we\u2019re all a little bit stupid around here.\u201d\nGrian blurted out a startled laugh at his friend\u2019s words, which slowly turned into a giggle, Mumbo chucked lightly after him, shoulders loosening a slightly. Grian\u2019s laughter trickled to a stop, the builder sniffling as turned to look out the glass of the bottle for a moment. Before Mumbo could do anything, the builder held out his hand in front of him, palm facing the sky.\nMumbo looked at him, confused slightly, \u201cWhat-\u201d\nGrian\u2019s hand ignited, a purple flame rolling around it until it covered it comply, popping and crackling up his wrist. Embers flew off it, twitching around in the air before dying out. Mumbo\u2019s eyes widened and he took a step back automatically. Grian swallowed, suddenly looking nervous,\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not like the rest of you, and\u2026 I know-I understand if this is too strange or--\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nGrian\u2019s eyes widened almost comedically large. Mumbo came closer, eyes full of amazement at the spectacle before him. He touched Grian\u2019s fingertips lightly with his own, intrigued to find that the flame didn\u2019t burn, it almost\u2026 buzzed, his fingertips tingled at the feeling. Mumbo\u2019s curiosity was interrupted by a shuddering breath in front of him, the man shot his head up to look at Grian, who now had tears running down his cheeks, still looking at him like a deer in the headlights. Mumbo snatched his hand away, embarrassed,\n\u201cI- sorry I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve-\u201d\n\u00a0Mumbo\u2019s rambling was cut off by Grian\u2019s arms wrapping around him, holding him tight as he extinguished the flame in his hand. Mumbo was caught off guard, but in the next second, he had his arms around his friend, hugging him close to his chest as Grian let out all the feelings he\u2019d been trying to deal with on his own for so long. Mumbo stroked his hand through the builder's hair gently, trying to comfort him.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Grian sobbed, not even attempting to quell the emotions finally breaking through to the surface.\n\u201cAny time.\u201d\nThe two stood there for a while, just holding each other. After a few minutes, Grian pulled away, looking tired and worn out, but as if the weight of the world had been lifted off his shoulders. Mumbo still had so many questions, but taking one look at Grian quelled them for another day, the man in front of him looked like he was going to drop at any moment.\n\u201cSorry for getting your suit all gross.\u201d Grian mumbled, rubbing his eyes.\nMumbo looked down, noticing the wet patch from where Grian had been crying into him.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. I can just wash it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI got snot on you.\u201d Grian grimaced.\n\u201cWhich can also be washed off,\u201d Mumbo rolled his eyes teasingly, \u201cHonestly, we have to swim out of here, it\u2019ll be gone by the time we reach the surface.\u201d\nGrian hummed in response, too tired for conversation. Mumbo noticed, deciding that it was probably time to head back. He told Grian as such and the duo walked back over to the entrance. Grian stopped the redstoner before he could swim out of the bottle,\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any fireworks left.\"\nMumbo handed him some wordlessly, both of them leaving the base and swimming to the surface. It was getting dark, the sun having just set over the horizon, but it still casted enough light that they could see the mainland. Mumbo turned in the water to look at his friend,\n\u201cAre you going to be able to make it to Hermitville?\u201d\nNormally something like that would\u2019ve been met with a sarcastic reply, some kind of witty comment for Mumbo to bounce off of into banter, but now Grian simply nodded his head. He looked out of it to the point where Mumbo considered just swimming back to his own base and crashing there with Grian for the night. He didn\u2019t get the chance to suggest this however, as Grian (seemingly realizing he would actually have to move to get somewhere) took off into the sky, gliding slowly over to the shopping district, Mumbo followed him, keeping close to make sure he wouldn\u2019t fall. The two landed in front of a portal, Grian\u2019s landing being a little shakier than his friend next to him. he steadied himself, walking into the portal after Mumbo. The walk back to Hermitville was quiet, but it wasn\u2019t awkward, both men taking comfort in the silence of the night around them, content to getting lost in their thoughts.\nHe tried not to show it, but Mumbo was still trying to make sense of what had happened. He knew what the Watchers were, kind of, so Grian saying that he was a Watcher didn\u2019t\u2026 make sense. He was a\u2026 what\u2019d the book call them? A player, like the rest of them, or at least Mumbo had thought so. He stole a glance at the person in question strolling along beside him, he certainly doesn\u2019t look like the figures in the windows, he thought to himself, looking back at the pathway. Still, he couldn\u2019t deny what he\u2019d seen in the glass bottle. It was magic, it had to be, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else that could create a flame like that, let alone one that felt like that. He touched the tips of his fingers with his thumb slightly, remembering the feeling. Mumbo felt his communicator go off, snapping him out of his thoughts,\nXisumaVoid:  have you found him?\nOh, right, he frowned slightly. He\u2019d completely forgotten about X and Doc, they\u2019re probably worried sick. He sent back a quick confirmation, saying that they were almost back at the village, before turning his communicator off and putting it away.\n\u00a0\nIt was completely dark once they got back to Hermitville, the glow of torches and lanterns around them illuminating the sleeping town. Mumbo spotted Xisuma sitting on Grian\u2019s doorstep, he had his head rested on the palm of his hand, biting his fingernails. Once he noticed the other two approach he got to his feet, a look of relief washing over him. Mumbo looked over at Grian, who seemed to look more tired by the second,\n\u201cYou should probably get to bed, you look knackered.\u201d\nGrian nodded lazily, shuffling past X into his house, shutting the door behind him. X looked back over to Mumbo, concern obvious on his face,\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d\nMumbo sighed, running a hand through his hair,\n\u201cYeah, yeah he\u2019s okay. He ended up flying back to his starter base,\u201d Mumbo frowned, \u201cWhat even was that? What\u2019d you guys do?\u201d\nX grimaced guiltily, he sat back down on the steps of the house and put his head in his hands,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just- we\u2019d come over to try and see if we could talk to him, but he wasn\u2019t home. I don\u2019t know why we started snooping around but we did, and we ended up going down into his basement? I think that\u2019s what it is, it's like an empty room way underground. All that was in there was a chest and it had this, mask in it. It looked like one of the masks from the windows in that chapel in the desert? With the symbol on it. We were trying to figure out what to do when he got home.\u201d\nMumbo sat down next to him, listening intently.\n\u201cHe looked really startled that we were in there, I tried to get him to talk to us but\u2026 it kind of just went downhill.\u201d\nX leaned back, resting his head on the door and looking up at the sky. He fidgeted with his hands subconsciously,\n\u201cDoc started getting mad, and then Grian got angry, and it just spiralled from there. Doc feels awful about it; says he doesn\u2019t know what came over him.\u201d\nMumbo hummed. He considered whether he should tell X about what Grian had shown him at the base, eventually deciding against it. It wasn\u2019t his secret to tell. He\u2019d make sure Grian told the others about it in the morning, however. Mumbo looked back over at X, even with the helmet on he could tell how exhausted he was.\n\u201cYou should go get some rest too, its been a long day for everyone I think.\u201d\nX nodded, pushing himself to his feet. He turned to look at Mumbo for a moment,\n\u201cThanks for going to get him, I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve liked either me or Doc going after him.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries.\u201d Mumbo smiled softly, watching his friend walk off back in the direction of his house. Mumbo stood from the steps as well, frowning slightly as he looked at the house behind him.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been lying to you all and I\u2019m putting you in danger.\u2019\n\nWhat had Grian meant by that? The redstoner walked back over to his own house, the thought playing on repeat in his head until he got into bed, finally falling asleep.\n\u00a0\nGrian woke up exhausted, he sat up in his bed and rubbed his tired eyes, disorientated. In the next moment however the memory of last night rushed up to greet him, his eyes going wide as he remembered what had happened.\n\nOh. \n\n\nShit.\n\nHe\u2019d told Mumbo. He\u2019d told him about being a Watcher, and his magic, why did he do that\u2014\nGrian\u2019s anxiety was cut off by a knock on his door, half tempting him to try and run again. He fought against the instinct, shuffling over to open it. Mumbo stood outside, looking slightly surprised that the door had opened.\n\u201cOh! Hey.\u201d He smiled.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Grian croaked, clearing his throat, \u201cSorry, I just woke up.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no that\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThe two stood there for a moment awkwardly.\n\u201cCan I come in, please?\u201d\nGrian blinked out of his daze, still very much half asleep,\n\u201cOh! Right, yeah sure, come in.\u201d\nHe moved out of the way, making room for his friend to walk inside. Mumbo did, walking to the bed and sitting on the edge of it. The silence from before picked back up, and Grian didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cWould you believe me if I told you everything that happened last night was a prank?\u201d\nMumbo raised an eyebrow at his friend.\nGrian sighed, \u201cRight. Couldn\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d\nMumbo patted the bed next to him, beckoning him to come over. Grian reluctantly did, sitting next to his friend. He stared down at his hands in his lap, refusing to make eye contact.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Mumbo began after a moment, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 a Watcher?\u201d\nGrian felt his throat close up. Oh boy, ok, they were doing this now. He swallowed down his anxiousness and continued to stare down at his hands, encouraging himself to say something.\n\u201cI\u2026 yes. Kind of.\u201d Grian breathed.\n\u201cKind of?\u201d Mumbo prompted. He tried to keep a calm tone to his voice, not wanting to freak Grian out with his questions. This was obviously something he was having a hard time talking about.\nMumbo\u2019s eyes widened as he realized something,\n\u201cYou\u2019re the \u2018Saved One\u2019, aren\u2019t you? The one from the window.\u201d\nGrian gave his friend a sad half-smile, \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be me.\u201d\nMumbo rested back against the wall, processing this new information. The two of them sat in silence for a minute, it was later in the morning, the sounds of birds and people trickling through the windows and under the door. Mumbo turned his eyes to his friend, who was still looking down at his hands.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell them.\u201d\nGrian bit his lip, \u201c\u2026I know,\u201d He hesitated.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mumbo shifted forward and put his hand on Grian\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright. Even if we don\u2019t understand it completely, we all care about you, you know? We want you to be able to trust us with stuff like this.\u201d\nGrian put his head on Mumbo\u2019s shoulder silently. He didn\u2019t know what to think. He knew, deep down, that his friends cared about him, he had no reason to think otherwise, but that\u2019s what scared him. The more they cared about him, the more they\u2019d be willing to risk for him, the more chance there was for the Watchers to use that against him, use it to hurt them. There was also now the issue of him leaving. He was still going to, he had to, but if the others knew that\u2026\n\u00a0\nThere was another knock at the door. Grian got up to answer it, finding a very nervous and very guilty looking Doc on the other side.\n\u201cHey man\u2026\u201d Doc rubbed the back of his head.\nGrian blinked, a little startled to see Doc again so soon after last night.\n\u201cI wanted to just come over and apologize for being a dick yesterday, I really don\u2019t know what came over me. I should not have yelled at you like that.\u201d Doc looked him in the eyes, an awkward smile plastered on his face.\nGrian smiled back at him, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I wasn\u2019t exactly being very honest with any of you\u2026 I understand why you were angry,\u201d Grian fiddled with the door, swinging it back and forth slightly \u201cSorry for yelling back at you.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 we\u2019re good?\u201d Doc confirmed, pointing a finger gun in Grian's direction.\nGrian chuckled, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.\u201d\nDoc looked relieved, breathing out and relaxing his shoulders, \u201cGreat! Great, ok, well. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d Doc nodded, giving Grian a little wave before turning on his feet and half jogging down the road. Grian watched him go for a second before he shut the door, looking back to Mumbo who was still sitting on his bed.\n\u201cEverything alright now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d\nGrian leant back against the door, suddenly feeling\u2026 confident? He wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but he felt sure of himself. Grian looked at his moustached friend, determined.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to tell the others. Today. Right now, actually.\u201d Grian decided.\nMumbo\u2019s brows raised, \u201cRight now as in\u2026 right now?\u201d\nGrian nodded his head quickly, walking over to a chest and grabbing his Elytra.\n\u201cYeah, yeah it\u2019s got to be now, otherwise I don\u2019t think I ever will.\u201d\nThe longer Grian sat at the table in Sahara\u2019s meeting room, the more he started regretting this.\n\u00a0\nThe only reason he hadn\u2019t called it off already was because Mumbo was sitting right beside him at the head of the table, the two had made extra chairs for the other hermits that would be arriving soon, Mumbo\u2019s chair being pushed up against Grian\u2019s in an attempt to make enough space. Neither of them said anything, and Grian was tapping his fingers on the table anxiously. He\u2019d picked the Sahara meeting room for this because it was the first place he could think of that would be able to fit everyone, and he\u2019d sent a message asking everyone to come over as soon as him and Mumbo had finished setting up. He didn\u2019t think twice about any of this, actively refusing too. He knew if he did, he\u2019d start panicking and nothing would ever come of it.\n\u201cHey?\u201d Grian and Mumbo turned to look behind themselves, Iskall stood at the doorway awkwardly, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s uh- there\u2019s somethings I\u2019ve got to tell everyone so\u2026 I needed to get everyone in one place.\u201d Grian muttered, almost unable to look his friend in the face. Iskall\u2019s confused eyes moved to Mumbo,\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for everyone else to get here before anything,\u201d the redstoner explained, he gestured to the table before him, \u201cYou can come sit and wait with us if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nIskall took a seat to Grian's left, he still looked confused and slightly worried, but he set aside his questions for when the others would arrive.\nThe others started to trickle in slowly, eventually filling the meeting room. TFC was the last one to enter, nodding at Grian as he sat down at the end of the table. A thick silence blanketed the room, no one was really sure what this was about. Grian broke the silence, clearing his throat,\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all probably wondering why I asked you to come here.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is some kind of stunt to get us to shop at Sahara, then Concorp wants no part in it.\u201d\nA few of the other hermits giggled, the tension in the room lessening a little at Cubs joke, Grian forced out a laugh with them, trying to relax.\n\u201cUh, no-no this doesn\u2019t\u2026 have anything to do with Sahara, I just- this was the easiest place to get everyone, so\u2026\u201d Grian trailed off, the room going quiet again as the others drew their attention back to the builder.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not Sahara related\u2026 what is it?\u201d Ren tilted his head, leaning on the table in front of him.\nGrian felt cold suddenly, his stomach dropping,\n\u201cWell, the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been\u2026 acting strange, and I know you\u2019ve all noticed by now, so I\u2019m sorry if I was worrying anyone but\u2026 there is a reason why I was keeping to myself.\u201d\nThe hermits looked at him keenly, no one saying anything as they waited for Grian to continue. Grian suddenly became very aware of how many eyes were actually on him in that moment, his own eyes fluttering around everyone\u2019s faces as he realized, yes, you\u2019re actually about to do this. He took a breath, trying to force himself to calm down, but he could feel his hands start to shake under the table. He clenched his teeth subconsciously, trying to clear his head, he needed to calm down, he couldn\u2019t think\u2014\nMumbo grabbed his wrist under the table, grounding him. Grian glanced at the man next to him and Mumbo looked back, a reassuring smile on his face. Grian took a less shaky breath, he needed to get it out, just rip it off like a Band-Aid.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a Watcher.\u201d He forced out in a breath. He looked down at the table, drawing into himself. The others looked at each other, confused.\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m not following,\u201d Scar admitted, looking at the man, \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\nGrian swallowed, using the hand Mumbo wasn\u2019t holding to rub his arm,\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a long story but\u2026 a long time ago, I used to live in another world. We called it Evolution, Evo for short, and\u2026 the Watchers looked over it. Two of them did, anyway. They were horrible, they treated us like we were\u2026 toys or something, they messed with our lives and changing things whenever they wanted. I tried to stand up to them, I didn\u2019t let them get to me as much as I could but\u2026 that only made them more interested in me. During one of the world\u2019s updates they just\u2026 took me, stole me away from everything I everyone knew, and I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop them.\u201d Grian could feel his eyes dampen at the memory, but he tried to push it aside, if he stopped talking now, he\u2019d lose his nerve.\n\u201cThe Watchers told me they\u2019d saved me, tried to convince me what they did was a good thing and that I should be grateful that they saw potential in me. I\u2026 there was nothing I could do so I just\u2026 tried to believe them. They gave me magic, and wings and everything. I was still treated like I was beneath them but\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYou have magic?\u201d Iskall asked softly.\nGrian looked at him for a moment before lifting his hand in front of him, pointing it towards a pencil that sat near the middle of the table. His hand lit up, purple light crackling around his fingertips as the pencil glowed the same colour, lifting into the air a few inches. The hermits gawked at it, watching as it hovered there for a few moments before the light went out and it landed back on the table.\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d Cleo muttered, leaning back in her chair, her eyes wide in astonishment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2026 Why have you never told us this before?\u201d Xisuma furrowed his brows, looking at Grian bewildered.\nThis is it, Grian thought to himself, this is where I need to make them understand. He straightened up in his chair, pulling his hand away from Mumbo to clasp them in front of himself.\n\u201cI never told any of you because if I did, it would\u2019ve put you all in danger. I\u2019m only telling you about all of this now because I\u2026 I don\u2019t have any other choice.\u201d Grian took a deep breath, thinking about his next words carefully, \u201cWhen I was still with the Watchers, I was able to go visit Evo. I wasn\u2019t allowed to interact with anyone or anything, not that I could anyway, but I was still able to see everyone. I used to spend all my time there and\u2026 and the Watchers didn\u2019t like that.\n\u201cThey destroyed it. They destroyed everyone and everything in that world and I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop them. They said they did it because I was too attached to mortality, and I needed to let that part of me go. They killed everything I cared about because I wasn\u2019t acting how they wanted me to.\u201d\nGrian kept his voice steady as he spoke, the other hermits looking at him in shock as they tried to process what they were hearing. Grian kept going,\n\u201cI escaped them, after that. Used all my magic to run to a random world and seal it off so they wouldn\u2019t be able to find me, that world being\u2026 this one. I had no idea there would be anyone else here and if I had I\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve stayed.\nI was the one that took the update barrier down, but when I did, the protection spell I had cast got used up accidentally and\u2026 now they\u2019ve found me.\u201d\nGrian looked at the others, desperation in his eyes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t let them hurt anyone else, and I can\u2019t go back there, with them. So\u2026 I\u2019m going to leave, find a new world that doesn\u2019t have anyone else in it and stay there. I\u2019ve been practising using my magic again and once I\u2019m strong enough, I\u2019ll create a portal and go and\u2026 none of you will have to get involved any more than you have already. You\u2019ll all be safe\u201d\nGrian held his breath, hoping that he\u2019d gotten through to them, that they understood why he had to do what he had to do.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrian whipped his head around to Mumbo, who was looking at him sternly, his eyebrows drawn down, \u201cGrian you can\u2019t just\u2026 leave.\u201d\n\u201cMumbo\u2019s right,\u201d Iskall agreed, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give up this quickly.\u201d\nGrian shook his head, \u201cThis isn\u2019t me \u2018giving up\u2019, this is me trying to keep you all safe.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe\u2026\u201d Joe started, a thoughtful expression on his face, \u201cMaybe you can focus on keepin\u2019 us safe, and we\u2019ll focus on keepin\u2019 you safe.\u201d\nFalse nodded, \u201cExactly. Plus, Grian, who\u2019s to say those Watchers won't just go after you again once you leave?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t- it wouldn\u2019t matter, they\u2019d be away from\u2026 you all, they\u2026\u201d Grian stammered looked around the table in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing, he had expected them to not want him to leave but\u2026 for some reason hearing it out loud was different.\n\u201cGrian,\u201d Mumbo drew the builder\u2019s attention back to him, a serious look in his eyes, \u201cDoes any part of this plan secure your own safety, or are you just trying to sacrifice yourself for us?\u201d\nGrian swallowed thickly, not knowing how to answer. He hadn\u2019t\u2026 really thought about it. All his faith in his plan came from the need to just, keep everyone else safe--alive. Thinking it over, he realized until now he hadn\u2019t even really thought about what he\u2019d do once he\u2019d leave Hermitcraft.\n\u201cIf worse comes to worst, if absolutely nothing else has worked and we\u2019re at our last option, we\u2019ll let you try this idea,\u201d Xisuma decided. Mumbo looked like he wanted to object, but X continued to talk before he could say anything, \u201cGrian, you don\u2019t have to deal with this on your own. You\u2019re not going to, this is our world as well, and we\u2019re not going to sit back and just let it get hurt.\u201d\nGrian lent back into his chair, feeling defeated. This isn\u2019t how he wanted this to go, this wasn\u2019t how it was meant to go, but despite this\u2026 he felt better. Knowing that his friends finally knew about everything felt good. It was the first time in a long time, not since Evo at least, that he truly felt\u2026 free.\n\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d he sighed, smiling unconfidently, \u201cI\u2026 I trust you guys.\u201d\nGrian couldn't exactly blame the others for treating him a bit like glass now. It\u2019s not like they were doing it on purpose, at least Grian didn\u2019t think they were, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026 weird when he saw it happen. It's just the little things, like when they sometimes stop talking and change the subject when he walks over, or how they\u2019ve stopped teasing him back when he tries to start some banter. It's coming from a good place, he knows they\u2019re just trying to make him happy but\u2026\nGrian huffed, sitting on top of his house. The very top of his house. He looked down far below him, the rest of the town looked small from up there, the competition between himself and the other members of Sahara Street (minus Stress) had given him a pretty good vantage point to see how the rest of the town was coming along, and he had to admit it, it looked pretty cool. Despite the different types of builds, what with Mumbo\u2019s apartment of house and the smaller Sahara just up the road, everything managed to mesh together nicely. Grian took off, gliding slowly to the ground as he let his mind wander, he needed to find a way to get the others to relax a little around him.\nHe landed outside his house and walked inside, standing in the front room for a moment as he thought. His eyes glanced to the hole in the floor by habit, he hadn\u2019t bothered closing it up now that everyone knew. He still hadn\u2019t really gotten used to it yet if he was honest, the first couple times another hermit had mentioned his magic to him he\u2019d felt himself get anxious automatically before remembering. He walked over to his mess of a storage system, if he could even call it that, and started rummaging around it half-heartedly, he opened his inventory to put away whatever junk may have been lying around it. His eyes stopped when he saw his mask, still sitting there from days prior. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to put it away somewhere, the busyness of the last few days having kept him preoccupied. He grabbed it and held it in his hands for a moment, to think everything that\u2019d happened was because of one little mask. He opened his enderchest, shoving it away and out of his sight before going back to his mess of chests and shulker boxes.\nHe really needed to get some kind of storage system, not that he knew what he was actually looking for, if anything-\nHe stopped, looking down into the shulker box he\u2019d just opened. He grinned, eyes devious and sparkling,\nHe knows what he\u2019s going to do.\n\u00a0\nScar, all in all, was having a good day. He sat on top of the newly made observatory at the edge of Sweet Berry, looking over the layout of the rest of the town, Jellie laid next to him, fully content to stay there and soak up the sunlight. Scar smiled lovingly at her, scratching behind her ear gently, overall it seemed crashing a rocket-ship into a house and being arrested wasn\u2019t the worst way to spend your time.\nThe sound of clucking broke him out of his good mood and he turned his head, looking behind himself at the baby chicken that was now sitting with them on the roof. Scar blinked, his mind trying to catch up with whatever this was as he stared at the baby chicken. Jellie turned to look at the intruding bird as well, confused as to why she\u2019d suddenly stopped getting pet. Before Scar could do anything, more clucking from in front of him caught his attention, and he spun his head around to see what looked to be around thirty baby chickens now wandering around on the ground.\nThoroughly confused, he picked up Jellie and jumped down, trying his best to not land on any of the little birds as he did so. Did these just spawn all at once\u2026? No, no that didn\u2019t make sense. He only realized what this was when he heard giggling from behind the wall of the observatory, sighing deeply, he turned to face the culprit,\nOnly to get an egg to the chest.\n\u201cWh- Grian!\u201d \nThe feathered man's giggles became a cackle as he took off, throwing more eggs as he went,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a Grian, sorry!\u201d The man laughed, flying away from the now chicken occupied town. Scar stood there dumbfounded. This\u2026 this was the absolute last thing he had been expecting today. But despite the chickens and eggy mess now running down his shirt, he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, it was nice seeing Gr-\u2026 Poultry Man, out and about again. A flock of chickens ran past him, clucking about in panic as Jellie chased them around.\nGrian was still laughing to himself when he got home. He walked inside and put the chicken mask back into storage, content with the day\u2019s mischief. The day was still young, however, and only minutes after, Grian\u2019s communicator went off.\n\u00a0\nMumboJumbo: hey, Iskall and I are doing some final touches to stuff at Sahara if you want to come over :)\nGrian grinned, not even giving it a second thought as he typed out a yes, walking back his door.\n\u00a0\nIskall and Mumbo were in the front area when he arrived, looking over the ordering system. Both lit up when they saw him, waving him over. The three spent the next hour or so goofing around, Grian messing with the Redstone and totally not breaking it while the other two followed him around, totally not fixing the totally not broken Redstone. Eventually, the trio found themselves outside, Iskall and Grian talking quietly on the ground while Mumbo stood up above them, finally fixing the window that he\u2019d been meaning to for so long. He glanced down behind himself, watching Grian laugh at something Iskall had said. He smiled, glad that the builder was finally opening up again, the contrast between Grian now to Grian even just a few days ago, when he was holding the weight of his secret all on his own, was incredible. Mumbo was so caught up in his thoughts that he wasn\u2019t paying attention, and one second he was standing on the window ledge,\nAnd the next he was falling.\nNo time to think about the fact that he didn\u2019t even have an elytra on, he squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for the impact that would definitely send him back to his bed. Except instead of the hard-concrete ground, Mumbo felt himself lurch to a stop in the air, turning his stomach and making him feel slightly sick, but ultimately unharmed. He slowly opened his eyes, looking around himself. He was hovering above the ground about a foot in the air, a purple glow surrounded him from head to toe. He shifted his eyes over to his friends, Iskall stood frozen in shock, and Grian had his hands out, both glowing and sparking with purple magic. The three stood there for a moment before Grian dropped his arms, the magic in his hands and around Mumbo dissipating. Mumbo landed on the ground, still looking at Grian with wide eyes.\n\u00a0\nGrian started to look nervous at the silence, but before he could say anything Iskall shouted behind him,\n\u201cGrian! Dude that was incredible!\u201d Iskall ran up to the builder, throwing a hand around his shoulder as he grinned like an excited puppy. Grian looked startled for a moment before relaxing, looking away from his enthusiastic friend a little sheepishly,\n\u201cI didn\u2019t- I didn\u2019t really do it on purpose, I just saw him fall and, reacted.\u201d Grian looked over to Mumbo, who was now lying on his back, trying to regain his breath and slow down his racing heart a little. Grian detached himself from Iskall, walking over to the redstoner to look down at him. He crossed his arms,\n\u201cSo. Why were you not wearing an Elytra, you absolute spoon.\u201d\nMumbo had his arm over his face, not looking at Grian,\n\u201c\u2026Because I\u2019m an absolute spoon?\u201d he mumbled.\nGrian snorted, holding his hand out to help the man to his feet. Mumbo sighed as he stood, rubbing his head.\n\u201cIt broke before I\u2019d even gotten here, and I\u2019d completely forgotten about it. I have another one at home, but I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s worth getting now.\u201d\nWithout a word Grian took off his elytra, handing it to his friend,\n\u201cHere, you can use mine to go grab it if you want.\u201d\nMumbo looked surprised, grabbing the elytra thankfully. He thanked his friend, putting it on before jogging over to the entrance,\n\u201cWon\u2019t be a tic!\u201d\nMumbo disappeared around the corner, the sound of fireworks going off as he went. Grian\u2019s attention was drawn back to his other friend who grabbed his shoulders, spinning him around to look at him dead in the eyes,\n\u201cGrian. Grian I have an idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMumbo flew back towards Sahara a few minutes later, his own elytra strapped to his back and Grian's stored safely away in his inventory. He ducked under the ribbon wrapped around the entrance and wandered inside, looking for the other Architech\u2019s. What he saw instead was Grian staring straight up at the sky, his hands alight with magic, Mumbo\u2019s brow furrows as he walked over.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nGrian looked towards him, his hands extinguishing as he waved.\n\u201cOh! Nothing much, Iskall had a really good idea.\u201d He said pleasantly, the hint of mischief in his eyes making Mumbo nervous. Before Mumbo could ask what that \u2018really good\u2019 idea was, both of them looked up as an excited shout rang out throughout the sky. Mumbo\u2019s eyes went wide as he watched Iskall fall towards the ground, gaining speed ridiculously fast.\n\u201cGrian!--\u201d\nMumbo\u2019s worried shout was cut off as Grian raised his hands back up, his magic catching light as he grabbed Iskall with it and nothing short of flung him around Sahara\u2019s courtyard. Iskall laughed maniacally as he flew around in the air, much faster than any elytra could ever go, Grian laughing along with him as he moved his friend up and down and around.\nMumbo simply watched, gobsmacked. This could not be safe, nothing about this could be safe in the slightest. He looked over to Grian to say as such, but his words caught in his throat when he saw Grian\u2019s expression, the spark of mischief had grown into ablaze, a shit-eating grin now clear on his face as he looked at Mumbo straight in his eyes.\n\u201cGrian. Don\u2019t.\u201d Mumbo warned, taking a step backwards.\nIf possible Grian\u2019s grin grew wider, he slowed down Iskall in the air slightly as he focused on Mumbo.\n\u201cGrian. Grian DON\u2019T, GRIAN--\u201d \nThe Redstoner\u2019s pleas were ignored as he was flung into the air, stomach dropping as he was flown around in a circle with Iskall, who was now laughing so hard that he was silent, doubled over in Grian\u2019s magic. Grian was laughing up at the two of them from the ground, taking way too much pleasure in sending his friends tumbling through the air.\n\u201cGrian! Put me down!\u201d Mumbo yelped, he tried to right himself as Grian hung him upside down, his tie flopping into his face and his jacket ruffled.\nIskall tried to catch his breath, \u201cB-But dude! No- look you-you don\u2019t even need to use an elytra now!\u201d The man wheezed, setting himself off into another fit of laughter with his own joke. Mumbo rolled his eyes, his stomach lurching again as Grian righted him, setting both of them back down on the ground. Mumbo lent over, resting his hands on his thighs as he tried to catch his breath.\n\u201cOh, this- this is the worst! You have way too many options to mess with everyone now!\u201d Mumbo laughed, exasperated.\n\u00a0\nGrian giggled softly, rubbing his eyes as he tried to not show the fatigue that rolled over him in waves. The builder watched the other two laugh, a feeling of pride blossoming in his chest. If you had told him a week prior that he\u2019d be using his magic like this he would\u2019ve never believed you, but now\u2026 now his magic felt like something good, something that didn\u2019t have to be used for destruction.\nSomething that he finally had control over.\nSahara was finally going to open. After months of building, and Redstoning, and end busting for shulker boxes, they were finally ready. Grian almost couldn\u2019t believe it, the thought that this giant project that\u2019d taken up most of their time was finally coming to a close. He was excited, every Architech was, but now left the question: what were they going to do for the opening? They knew they wanted some kind of event but, they weren\u2019t sure what. In the end, none of them even got to think about it, False setting up her tent and queue along with Ren parking his camper van right out the front of the shop made it pretty clear what was going to happen. The trio spent the next few days preparing for the grand opening, deciding that it would be held that weekend, which gave them time to work on any last-minute things that might rear their heads, along with giving Grian time to hand out invitations.\nWell, hand out invitations if you consider flying past your friends at top speed while throwing paper and eggs labelled come to Sahara\u2019s Grand Opening Saturday! \u2018handing out\u2019. It got the job done regardless, and Grian was having fun throwing things at people. He was passing over a forest near the medieval district when he saw the Watcher Obelisk, its obsidian walls creating a jarring contrast to the greenery below. He wasn\u2019t planning on stopping, but he found himself flying towards the opening near the top of the tower regardless, landing on the upper level. It was dark inside, despite the large opening he had just flown through, the obsidian soaking up the light from and creating an eerie atmosphere. Grian looked around, the floor was made of stone slabs, the entrance to a spiral staircase going down to his left. A Watcher symbol was engraved into the ground using bedrock, the sign of a real Watchers power having been used to create the structure.\nGrian knew what would be in this building, creating hundreds of these kind of ruins the mystery after a while. There\u2019d be some kind of dumb riddle or poem on the first floor, then chests with rewards on the next, maybe a dungeon or maze underneath everything. Real spooky.\nRealizing that he\u2019d get nothing out of actually being here, Grian went to take off again, stopping when he heard something downstairs. Curious, he walked down the staircase, finding Stress at the bottom kneeling in front of a chest. Grian watched her rummage around in it for a moment before she closed it, turning around and jumping when she saw Grian standing there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBlimey, when\u2019d you get here?\u201d She breathed, standing upright.\nGrian shrugged, \u201cAbout a minute ago, flew in from upstairs.\u201d\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d Stress nodded, looking around the room casually. Her eyes turned upward, \u201cAnythin\u2019 interestin\u2019 up there then?\u201d\nGrian shook his head, \u201cNah, it\u2019s empty, there\u2019s probably something under the tower if you haven\u2019t looked yet though.\u201d\n\u201cYa reckon?\u201d She replied, sitting on the chest she\u2019d just been looking through.\n\u201cYeah well, when you build enough of these things, they start getting a bit predictable.\u201d\nStress\u2019s eyes widened in realization at his words, she leant back on the chest and nodded her head slowly, \u201cRight\u2026 right, yeah I didn\u2019t even think\u2026 you\u2019d probably know these things inside and out, huh?\u201d\nGrian nodded lazily, she wasn\u2019t wrong. The Watchers very rarely went off the book when it came to structures, sure puzzles and clues and challenges got changed around often, but the buildings they were held in weren\u2019t. Grian had found it annoying at first, wanting to experiment with different blocks and designs, but after a while he was grateful for it, being able to build without actually thinking about the building he was making. Stress was quiet, looking away from the builder almost guiltily.\nAh.\nHe hadn\u2019t meant to make this awkward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good you guys are still coming to these things, honestly. Not a good idea to get on the Watcher\u2019s bad side.\u201d He chuckled, rubbing the back of his head. Stress hummed, unconvinced,\n\u201cStill. Don\u2019t feel right takin\u2019 stuff from people who\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d She muttered.\nGrian blinked, taken aback. This wasn\u2019t the direction he was expecting this conversation to go. Before Stress could get another chance to speak, Grian grabbed a handful of invitations from his inventory, throwing them down at her from his spot at the top of the staircase. She watched a little dumbfounded as they fluttered to the ground, creating a mess of paper on the floor in front of her. Grian looked at her for a moment before grinning,\n\u201cSee you on the weekend!\u201d\nAnd with that, he turned on his heels, jumping back up the stairs and taking off without a second thought.\n\u00a0\nThe weekend arrived sooner than any of them could\u2019ve expected. The rest of the hermits were quick to save their spot in the line, pitching tents outside the building, or in Concorp's case, pitching a whole mini canteen to sell food and drink to the waiters in line. Grian found that funny along with a little ridiculous, but if it got Cub and Scar to show up then he wasn\u2019t going to complain. The plan was to open the store on Sunday but have everyone over for some kind of camp out the Saturday night, and as much as it was for Sahara, it was also just a way for everyone to hang out together, which is something they all desperately needed. Grian couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019d seen everyone in the same place, well, apart from the other day when he\u2019d told them all about the Watchers, but this was exceptionally more fun.\nThe sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the hermits as they started to get ready for the night ahead. Mumbo and Iskall were setting up a campfire while Ren and Doc stood near Ren\u2019s camper-van, chatting about something quietly. The rest of the hermits were either setting up their tents or still arriving, the area filling up quickly. It all felt very homey, no one was worried about anything, simply enjoying each other\u2019s company as the sun set. At some point, someone started playing music, and the night began.\nGrian sat near the campfire, warming himself up against the cold night. Jellie sat in his lap, soaking up the heat with him. He pet her absentmindedly, giggling when he saw Scar pouting in his direction, mouthing \u2018traitor\u2019 at Jellie from the Concorp canteen Cub wouldn\u2019t let him leave. Across from him, Iskall was telling Cleo about how Grian had used his magic to save Mumbo the other day, going on about how cool it was when he\u2019d gotten to fly around in it.\n\u00a0\nGrian suddenly felt overwhelmed. He wasn\u2019t sure\u2026 why, but one moment he was perfectly content with sitting around with his friends and the next\u2026 the light quickly became too bright and music too loud. He stood up, putting Jellie down gently as he walked away from the commotion. He ducked under the red ribbon over Sahara\u2019s entrance, trying not to draw attention to himself as he slipped away from the party. He walked to the courtyard, taking comfort in the dull glow of the touches and faded music from behind him. He breathed deeply, the cold night air wrapping around him. He sat on the edge of the water feature, running his hand thought the water as he let his mind drift.\n\u201cYou doin\u2019 alright there?\u201d\nGrian turned to look at Joe who was looking at him with a small smile, arms wrapped around himself against the cold, his shirt not doing much to keep out the chill.\nGrian nodded a little, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m alright. I think everything just\u2026 got a bit too much.\u201d\nJoe hummed in reply, he gestured next to Grian, \u201cMind if I join ya\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure, go ahead.\u201d\nJoe sat across from the builder, crossing his legs as he looked down into the water next to them. They sat in content silence, listening distantly to the others outside, the music muffled.\n\u201cIt was nice for you boys to set up this shindig, always nice to see\u2026\u201d Joe trailed off as he thought about how to finish that sentence, his normal rhythmic patterns failing him in the moment. Grian cocked his head at him, shooting him a confused looked. Joe huffed after a moment, shifting his glasses slightly as he rubbed his eyes.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Grian asked quietly, leaning forward.\nJoe sighed, \u201cI\u2019m alright, just not on my A-game today, been real tired recently.\u201d\n\u201cTired?\u201d Grian prompted.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is, really. I keep having these dreams, nightmares I suppose, but I always forget them before I wake up.\u201d Joe smiled at his friend, noticing the worried expression on his face, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad, just means I\u2019m yawnin\u2019 a little more thought out the day.\u201d\nJoe cleared his throat, \u201cAt any rate, I came over to cheer you up, not the other way around.\u201d\nGrian let out a small laugh, looking back into the water next to him.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Grian stopped, curling into himself subconsciously, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about my old world a lot, I guess.\u201d He mumbled.\nJoe nodded compassionately, remaining silent as he waited for Grian to continue.\nThe builder took a breath, trying to ignore the way his eyes stung at the thought of Evo, \u201cI think\u2026 just seeing everyone together like this reminded me of them.\u201d\n\u201cDid you all get together a lot, then?\u201d Joe asked softly.\n\u201cYeah. We\u2019d always go after the next Watcher portal together, so none of us would get left behind. Sometimes we\u2019d go in groups to check out buildings or clues but that was normally just me and\u2026\u201d Grian trailed off, eyes unfocused as he looked at the water, \u201c\u2026me and Taurtis.\u201d\nGrian shook his head, rubbing his eyes as he snapped himself out of his memories, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t- I\u2019m being a little ridiculous-\u201d\n\u201cNothing ridiculous about grief, Grian.\u201d\nGrian felt like the air had been knocked out of his chest, he blinked as Joe\u2019s words sank into him, Grief was a heavy word, and it felt wrong on his tongue as he played it over in his head. He\u2019d been trying to avoid thinking about Evo the almost year he\u2019d been on Hermitcraft, so maybe\u2026 he hadn\u2019t really gotten a chance to properly get over what had happened. He wiped his eyes again, not wanting to get more emotional than he already was.\n\u201cWe- we should go back before\u2026 anyone else gets worried.\u201d Grian deflected, getting to his feet hurriedly. Joe followed, grabbing Grian's jumper before he could run off.\n\u201cGrian\u2026 it\u2019s alright to be upset, you know? What happened to you\u2026 you didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\nNeither did they, the builder thought to himself bitterly. He gave Joe a smile,\n\u201cI know, I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll be alright. Thanks for coming to check on me.\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe two walked back over to the entrance, ducking under the ribbon to see the party raging on just as much as when they left. False called over when she spotted them,\n\u201cOi! I\u2019m first in line, better not be giving Joe a look around before it\u2019s even open.\u201d\nGrian snorted, his mood lightening a little as he walked further into the crowd. The night was still young, and he wasn\u2019t going to let his head stop him from enjoying it anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGrian knew he was dreaming from the moment he opened his eyes.\n\u00a0\nHe looked around himself, not sure where he was meant to be. Every direction was black, it looked like it stretched on forever, kind of like his infinity rooms. Maybe it did. He picked a direction and started walking, not wanting to stay in the same place for too long.\n\u201cHello, Diamond.\u201d\nGrian froze, throat closing up at the sound of that voice. He tried to swallow down his fear, not wanting to give them the satisfaction of seeing him afraid. He turned to face them, standing his ground.\n\u201cBraid.\u201d\nThe Watcher loomed over him a few feet away, their braided hair flowing slightly as if they were underwater, they grinned at the name,\n\u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to hear your voice,\u201d The Watcher laughed lightly, walking towards him, \u201cAfter you abandoned us, I thought I was to never hear it again.\u201d\nGrian clenched his hand at the word abandoned, keeping his face devoid of emotion.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He deadpanned, unable to stop himself from glaring at the figure in front of him.\n\u201cStraight to the point, I see.\u201d They lent down, looking at Grian almost lovingly. It made him feel sick.\n\n\u201cI suppose you already know that you have to come home, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am home.\u201d He bit back. The Watcher didn\u2019t react to the anger, humming almost lovingly as they touched his cheek. Grian fought back the urge to flinch away.\n\n\u201cYour friends are all very funny. I see why you\u2019d want to stay, I really do, but you don\u2019t belong here, Diamond. We\u2019re not mad at you for running off, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about, we just want you back safe.\u201d \n\nGrian hated himself for the sudden guilt in the pit of his stomach. They knew what they were doing, they knew how to manipulate him, they knew how to make him feel like he was somehow in the wrong. He wouldn\u2019t let them get to him anymore.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back with you. Ever.\u201d\nThe Watcher stood back up, their large stature intimidating.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make this hard, Diamond. We just want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d\n\nLiar, Grian wanted to scream, they didn\u2019t care about \u2018what was best\u2019 for him, they just wanted him as\u2026 as some sort of prize, something they could toy with and fond over like a pet.\n\u201cPlus,\u201d The Watcher continued, \u201cYou\u2019ve already damaged this world enough as it is by yourself.\u201d\nGrian\u2019s brows furrowed, he looked at the Watcher suspiciously.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nThe Watcher paused, looking at him almost pityingly, \u201cOh dear, you really don\u2019t know?\n\n\u201cDo you think this update was so glitchy for any other worlds? Why do you think there were so many issues? Why do you think those issues were only fixed when we showed up?\n\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come when we did, who knows what could\u2019ve happened to this world. For all we know, it could\u2019ve destroyed itself from the inside. You did your best, really, but trying to take down a barrier all by yourself was reckless.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve gotten everyone in this world killed, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Watcher spoke casually, as if they hadn\u2019t just shattered Grian\u2019s world around him. He caused all those issues? He could\u2019ve\u2026 he\u2026\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re lying.\u201d Grian accused weakly, looking away from the Watcher still standing over him.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not lying.\u201d They reached out a hand again, tilting Grian's chin up to face them, \u201cCome back with us, and this will never happen again.\u201d\nGrian swallowed, a part of him wanting to just back down, give in and go back to that hell so he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone anymore.\n\u201cI will never go back to you.\u201d He croaked out, hands trembling with how tightly he clenched them. The Watcher continued to look at him, expression hidden behind the mask, and for a moment Grian was worried he might be attacked.\nHe wasn\u2019t, instead, he was met with a disappointed sigh, and the Watcher let go of his face as they took a step back.\n\n\u201cFine. If you want to do this the hard way, we\u2019ll do this the hard way.\u201d\n\nThey reached under their cloak, \u201cJust remember, Grian,\u201d\nGrian felt himself go cold at his real name, but that feeling was nothing compared to the way his heart stopped when he saw what the Watcher held in their hand,\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever happens next is on you.\u201d They finished, holding a pair of broken, blue and red checkered headphones up to his face.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoe Hills gasped awake, sweat running down his head as he got his bearings. He was in Cleo\u2019s tent; the zombie girl having offered a spot to him to spend the night. He calmed down his breathing, trying to remember what he\u2019d been dreaming about.\n\n\u2026Something about\u2026 fire? Something had been on fire\u2026\n\nThe man sighed, grabbing his glasses as he made his way over to the entrance of the tent, trying not to wake his friend as he did so. Unzipping the flap and walking outside, he took a breath, the sun was only just coming over the horizon and he was very obviously the only one awake. It was still chilly out, the damp grass around him swaying softly in the early morning breeze. He closed his eyes, letting himself enjoy the morning.\n\u00a0\nThen time stopped for a moment,\nAnd Joe Hills was gone.\n\n\u2026Grian\u2026\n\n\nGrian\u2026 Grian?\n\n\nGrian!\n\nGrian woke with a start, flinching away from the hand on his shoulder by habit. He looked around, trying to remember where he was. Blinking away the sleep from his eyes, he looked up at Mumbo, who was crouching down over him, his expression worried. Grian breathed deeply, pushing himself up on his sleeping bag.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Mumbo whispered, not wanting to wake the still sleeping Swede on the other side of the tent. Grian nodded, rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine, yeah, I\u2019m okay. Just had a weird dream.\u201d He yawned, the adrenaline leaving him and tiredness taking its place. Mumbo frowned, his worried expression deepening,\n\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 A Watcher\u2026 a Watcher visited me.\u201d Mumbo\u2019s eyes went wide,\n\u201cYou mean like, a real Watcher?\u201d he asked, sitting down properly. Grian went to reply but was cut off by a shout from outside. Mumbo and Grian looked at each other for a moment before rushing to the entrance. Mumbo unzipped the tent, Grian following close behind,\n\u00a0\nHe almost fell back into the tent when he saw what was outside.\nCleo stood at the entrance to her tent, having been the one who yelled, and Grian could understand why. The area in front of Sahara had been destroyed. Luckily all the tents had been on the far side of the building out of harm's way, but that seemed to be the only thing not touched. Obsidian and sandstone decorated the area and Sahara\u2019s front looked almost\u2026 decayed, the concrete crumbled, and vines and moss decorated it at random. The only thing that looked purposely placed was a portal, it stood on a platform a few blocks in the air, cobblestone steps leading up to it. Two statues stood to either side, like the ones from the chapel, but these ones looked almost\u2026 angry. Disappointed. Bedrock decorated the platform and area surrounding it, and the Watcher symbol that stood at the portal made it very clear where this had all come from.\nMumbo and Grian could only stand there and stare at the scene in front of them in shock.\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What happened?\u201d Iskall remarked stepping out of the tent. The rest of the Hermits started to wander outside, having also been woken up by the commotion going on. After a moment of shock, they began to walk around a little, trying to figure out what was happening. Grian felt his heart in his throat as he walked over to the portal, a million thoughts rushing around in his head but none of them coherent enough to understand, and maybe that was a good thing. Now up the stairs, he noticed a series of signs placed in front of the portal, a poem,\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA little birdy flies from his cage,\n\n\nHe flutters and flitters about in a rage,\n\n\nUnable to guide him, he leaves with no trace,\n\n\nSo, another little birdy must now take his place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nGrian furrowed his eyebrows, reading over the poem again. He felt a shiver run through him, whipping around to look at his fellow hermits scattered though out the area below.\n\nAnother little birdy must now take his place...\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that. He didn\u2019t like any of this, and if what he thought the poem was implying was true\u2026\n\u201cGuy\u2019s, has anyone seen Joe?\u201d Cleo called out, stepping out from her tent again, \u201cI thought he was in \u2018ere but\u2026\u201d She stopped, frowning as she looked down at the grass. She lent down and picked something up, Grian couldn\u2019t tell what it was from where he was standing, but as he made his way towards her, he felt his stomach drop out from under him.\nIt was Joe\u2019s glasses.\nThe other hermits gathered around her, still half asleep and confused. No one had seen Joe, at least not since last night, and Joe wouldn\u2019t just leave his glasses on the ground. Cleo turned them over in her hand, one of the lenses were broken from where she had stepped on them by accident. she grimaced, feeling awful about it,\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrian, you have to calm down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe hermit\u2019s attention was suddenly drawn back in front of them, Mumbo stood with his hand out, facing Grian. The builder in question was shaking, staring at the glasses in Cleo\u2019s hand, his breathing shallow and eyes unfocused. Magic crackled around him, whipping in the air like it would attack anything that got close. Mumbo ignored the threatening image and took a small step forward,\n\u201cGrian, breathe.\u201d\nGrian inhaled shakily and Mumbo took another step, close enough now that he was able to grab Grian\u2019s shoulders lightly, trying to ground him. The builder took a few more breaths, slowly coming back to himself. His magic dissipated as he got control of it, no longer overwhelmed, and he leant into his friend, energy suddenly drained. Mumbo kept him upright, looking down at his friend concerned,\n\u201c\u2026They took Joe.\u201d Grian slurred.\nMumbo furrowed his brows, glancing over at the rest of the group who looked just as confused,\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nGrian sniffled and rubbed his eyes, looking down at the ground, \u201cThe Watchers they\u2026 one of them visited me in a dream last night and\u2026 they told me to go back with them but I said no and now they\u2019ve taken Joe and this is my fault I\u2019m so sorry--\u201d\n\u201cHey, Hey it\u2019s okay.\u201d Mumbo reassured gently, trying to stop him from spiralling into another panic.\n\u201cWhy would they have taken Joe?\u201d Cub glanced up at the portal in front of them for a moment before looking back Grian, who was trying to calm himself down again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t-- he said\u2026 something about having nightmares he couldn\u2019t remember last night? It might be because of that?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever the reason is,\u201d Cleo interrupted, clutching the glasses in her hand tightly, \u201cWe have to go get him back.\u201d The other\u2019s nodded in agreement. Grian pulled away from Mumbo, taking a step towards the group,\n\u201cNo. No, none of you can go in there.\u201d He insisted, looking at them frantically. Cleo stared at Grian in shock before frowning, taking a step towards him defiantly,\n\u201cWhat? We have to! We can\u2019t just let them have Joe.\u201d She argued.\n\u201cI know! I know we can\u2019t but if any of you go in there you might get hurt--\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d\n\u201cYes, it does! If you go in there you could die!\u201d\n\u201cSo? We\u2019d just come back and try again!\u201d\n\u201cNot if you\u2019re killed by a Watcher! If a Watcher kills you, that\u2019s it. Game over, no respawn, you\u2019re gone for good.\u201d A silence fell over the group as they took in the information. Grian put his head in his hands, rubbing his eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t let them kill any more of my friends.\u201d\nCleo stopped, staring at Grian in shock. \u201cGrian\u2026\u201d she started, suddenly feeling bad for yelling at him. She sighed, walking the rest of the way up to the builder, \u201cI know where you\u2019re coming from, and I understand that you\u2019re scared but\u2026 We need to go. All of us. Think about it, if only you went, that\u2019d be exactly what they\u2019d want, wouldn\u2019t it? To get you alone? Please Grian, trust us to be able to help you.\u201d\nGrian looked at the ground in silence for a moment. He signed, deeply, wrapping his arms around himself, \u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d he looked at the zombie girl defeated, \u201cWe\u2026 we need to think of a plan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Hermits dispersed, going their separate ways for the time being to prepare themselves for the journey ahead of them. Most of them went back to their bases to collect armour and weapons and at around midday, they all regrouped outside the portal. Before any of them could say anything, Grian gathered them around to a table he had set up, on which sat an array of what looked like purple bracelets.\n\u201cBefore anything,\u201d Grian began, \u201cYou\u2019re all going to put these on.\u201d\nThe Hermits did, slipping them around their wrists. Once they were on, they could feel a wave of magic pulse through them, their arms tingling where the bracelets touched their skin.\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d False asked, fiddling with the band.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to help us hide from the Watchers while we\u2019re in there,\u201d Grian explained, \u201cThey\u2019re all enchanted with a smaller version of the protection spell I used to hide Hermitcraft, they\u2019ll still be able to see you physically, but they won't be able to sense you\u2019re there otherwise.\u201d\nThe others nodded at the explanation. Grian sighed lightly,\n\u2018At this point, we need all the protection we can get.\u2019 He thought to himself. Grian continued,\n\u201cOkay, so, that portal leads to the Watcher\u2019s domain. They live in the End, but it\u2019s not just any version of the End, it\u2019s the End, the original, every other version of the End is just a copy of theirs. I have no idea where that portal is going to put us, but I have a good idea of where Joe will be when we get there, so when we go through, stick by me. Stay in a pair, don\u2019t wander off and If you see anything, say something,\u201d Grian sighed, looking tense as he spoke, \u201cWe get in, we get Joe, we get out.\u201d\nThe others nodded determinedly, holding their swords and bows and whatever other weapons they had with them in their hands.\n\u201cThis is so totally a trap.\u201d Iskall grimaced, looking at the portal above them.\n\u201cOf course it is, but we don\u2019t exactly have any other choice.\u201d Cleo replied, walking ahead of the group and up the stairs. The rest of them followed close behind her, Grian moving through them to stand at the front. He breathed deeply,\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere we go then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was dark on the other side of the portal. Grian blinked, looking around himself to make sure everyone else had made it through safely. They had, and were now looking at the world around them. Grian was right, it looked like any other End world they\u2019d seen, the only difference being the large castles and towers stretching up around them. They looked as if they spanned on for miles, made up of mostly obsidian, the dark blocks making them as threatening as they were tall.\nThey couldn\u2019t stand there and gawk at them for long, however. Grian urged them forward, walking quickly in the direction of one of the buildings. They stayed grouped close together, keeping alert for any danger that might jump out at them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Doc asked quietly, walking up next to Grian. The builder glanced in his direction for a moment,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Braid and Crown\u2019s territory, Watchers are very defensive about their space and if this was all just to get me here, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ve got Joe.\u201d\n\u201cBraid and Crown?\u201d\nGrian looked embarrassed for a moment, \u201cOh right-- they\u2019re the Watchers that took me from my old world, I got tired of calling them \u2018Watcher one and two\u2019 so I\u2026 I gave them nicknames.\u201d\nDoc nodded, remaining silent. After a minute or so of walking, they reached another castle, it didn\u2019t look different from any other building around them, but Grian stopped in front of it. He reached out a hand, pushing the door open and walking inside, the rest of them following behind.\nThe door opened up to a large entrance room. A stone staircase stood in front of them, going up to another floor, a purple stained-glass chandelier reached down from the ceiling, and despite the end rods lining the walls, it was still dark inside. The Hermits stood there for a moment, thinking over where to start.\n\u201cMaybe we should just pick a direction and walk?\u201d False suggested. Grian nodded in agreement, darting his eyes around quickly as he thought about the best place to look first.\n\u201cRight-- okay. Let\u2019s start over here then.\u201d He walked towards the staircase, leading the group through another doorway and into a corridor. Grian shuddered slightly at the sight of it, too many memories of him running down halls identical to this played in his mind. He tried to block them out, he couldn\u2019t get distracted.\n\u00a0\nWalking to the end of the hallway they turned a corner, and Grian quickly stumbled back behind the wall, keeping the others from walking around it. They looked at him panicked, raising their weapons. He held a finger out at them, telling them to wait for a moment. He peered around the corner again, looking through the doorway and into the large, open ballroom that stood on the other side.\n\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s over there?\u201d Scar whispered, looking slightly frantic.\nGrian squinted, there was someone on the other side of the room, but they were too far away and looking the opposite direction\u2026 his eyes widened as he realized,\n\u201cIt\u2019s Joe.\u201d\nThe others untensed, relief spreading thought the group. Cleo looked around the corner, and before Grian could do anything, she darted around it, making a B line towards her friend.\n\u201cCleo wait--\u201d\n\u201cJoe! are you alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJoe turned his head towards her, and she stopped.\n\u00a0\nGrian\u2019s magic surrounded Cleo, pulling her away from Joe a millisecond before another wave of magic hit the spot she had been standing in. She stumbled over, not prepared for the sudden shift. The rest of the hermits rushed around the corner at the commotion, standing wide-eyed at the scene in front of them.\nJoe hovered a few centimetres off the ground, purple magic wrapping itself around him like bolts of lightning, enough that he almost looked like he was glowing. A mask, a Watcher mask, was strapped to his face, his hair flowing around it like he was underwater. He grinned, a voice that almost wasn\u2019t his spoke,\n\u00a0\n\n \u201c\u1ef2\u0330\u0353o\u0356\u035e\u0345u\u0364\u0350\u035c \u0307\u0363\u035e\u00a0 n\u0348\u032d\u032d\u1e1b\u0317\u0301v\u0324\u0325\u035fe\u036d\u033e\u035cr\u0356\u030e\u0303\u00a0 \u00a0\u0337\u031e\u0364s\u031d\u035f\u0360ho\u034d\u0353\u036e\u01b0\u032a\u0350ld\u0355\u0300\u0300\u00a0 \u00a0\u0338\u034d\u036fh\u0328\u032c\u035fa\u0353\u033a\u0310v\u0332\u0362e\u0314\u030d\u0345 \u0347\u031d\u0349\u00a0 c\u0367\u0302\u036e\u020d\u031f\u0319m\u0321\u0366\u0300e\u0321\u033b\u0359\u00a0 \u00a0\u0318\u0301\u034bh\u0348\u0364\u0352\u0205\u0324\u0349\u1e5f\u0313\u035d\u00eb\u0356\u0332.\u201d \n\nWhen you\u2019re faced with a dangerous situation, it\u2019s natural to go into a flight or fight response, it\u2019s the brain's first way of making sure you don\u2019t die instantaneously. Grian, despite his magic, was not a very good fighter, so that option was out straight away. However, ask anyone that knows him, and they\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s definitely an above-average flier.\nSo, no one should really be surprised that his first instinct when faced with the sudden and threatening visual of his friend hovering in front of him (who had just tried to kill his other friend), was to grab the other hermits with his magic, turn around, slam the door, and haul ass in the other direction. The others realized they were suddenly sprinting down the hallway after a few seconds of being yanked along, finding their footing under them and actually running down the hall.\n\u201cGrian what- Grian we can't just leave him, wait!--\u201d Cleo spluttered, still trying to process what the hell was going on, everything had happened so fast--\n\u201cTrust me, we\u2019re not leaving him!\u201d Grian interrupted, the panic in his voice thick. He hit himself mentally, how was he so stupid? Did he really just expect Joe to be sitting around somewhere completely fine? His self-deprecating thoughts were cut off by an explosion behind them, and he didn\u2019t need to look to know that Joe was probably now hot on their trail.\n\u201cWhere- where are we going? Grian, what do we do?\u201d Iskall yelped, trying to keep up with the group.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the courtyard, it\u2019s an open space, less dangerous-- for us and him,\u201d Grian rushed around a corner, almost running into the wall in his haste, \u201cWe need to get that mask off him, quickly!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey made it to the courtyard. It was a large open space, the ground was made of endstone, endstone brick laying out pathways to other entrances in the surrounding walls. A large stone statue of a Watcher sat in the middle of the field, its wings were made of purple glass, unfurled and large. End rods decorated the four walls, lighting the area against the darkness of the End. The hermits ran to the statue, fumbling around it till they were hidden on the other side.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time so I\u2019m going to try and explain as quickly as I can,\u201d Grian started, breathing heavily as he tried to catch his breath, \u201cWe need to get that mask of him. If we don\u2019t, it\u2019s going to kill him, the mask- the masks are used to control magic in a way, heighten it, that much magic flowing into a player who\u2019s never experienced it before will destroy them.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t- why is he attacking us?\u201d Mumbo gasped, also trying to regain his breath.\nGrian glanced around the side of the statue, trying to see if Joe had made it to them yet, \u201cHe\u2019s- I think the Watchers have done something to the mask, made it\u2026 brainwash him, or something, like the mask is in control. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u00a0\"It's not very polite to run from your friends, you know.\" \n\n\u00a0\nThe group jumped back in surprise at Joe\u2019s sudden appearance behind them. Grian scurried in front of the others, creating a barrier just in time to counter a bolt of magic he\u2019d thrown at them. The others scuffled backwards, weapons raised but still hesitant, they needed to protect themselves but\u2026 but they didn\u2019t want to hurt Joe.\n\u201cJoe, you\u2019ve gotta snap outta it!\u201d Cleo pleaded, a tight grip on the trident in her trembling hand.\nThe man simply smiled, tilting his head a little, \"Snap out of what?\"\nHe raised his hand again, another bolt of magic shooting towards the group. Grian blocked it with his shield but stumbled back against the impact, straining to keep the barrier intact. He looked back at his friends, his eyes desperate and slightly guilty as Joe walked closer, a continuous beam of magic assaulting the shield,\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hurt him but please, please-- we need to get that mask off!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMaybe it was the desperation in Grian\u2019s voice, or maybe it was the fact that the shield he was trying to keep up was starting to crack apart, but something made Doc suddenly kick into gear, not thinking twice before rushing around the side of the barrier and throwing a trident in Joe\u2019s direction. It didn\u2019t hit him, whizzing past his arm and landing on the ground a few feet away, but it was enough to blow Joe\u2019s arm back and stop the attack for a moment. Grian reacted instantly, lowing the barrier and grabbing Joe with his magic, throwing him back into the wall. Hard. Hard enough that the wall crumbled a little at the impact, throwing dust into the air.\nGrian stumbled a little, leaning forward on himself as he tried to make his head stop spinning,\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep him back with magic forever, we\u2014we need to think of something, fast.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to move, if we\u2019re not in one group it\u2019s harder to go after us all at once.\u201d False stated, eye\u2019s hardening as she prepared herself for the fight.\nThe others nodded, dispersing out a little from their huddle they\u2019d found themselves in, spreading out over that part of the courtyard. Laughter drew their attention back over to Joe, who\u2019d recovered from the impact and gotten back to his feet,\n\u201cNow this is more exciting!\u201d He walked towards the hermits, stopping to pick up the trident Doc had thrown at him. It lit up as soon as he touched it, glowing purple and sparking, \u201cThanks for the free weapon, Doc.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThink of something, I\u2019ll distract \u2018em.\u201d\nFalse drew her sword suddenly, rushing towards the man that was advancing towards them. She swung at him, sword clashing against the trident he used to counter her. She stepped back for a second before swinging again, the two moving around each other like some kind of dance. Grian watched in a panic, hands raised in case something went wrong and he needed to pull False out of there.\nThe others stood in shock for a moment before glancing at each other, minds racing to think of something, anything--\n\u201cOkay-- okay I think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d Xisuma\u2019s voice crackled through the speakers of his helmet, beckoning the others over to him hurriedly.\n\u00a0\nDespite the new powers Joe now had, it hadn\u2019t done anything to improve his actual combat skills, and False soon had him on the ropes. The man yelled in frustration, his magic crackling around him furiously as he pushed her away from him, False unable to stop herself as she went flying back towards the group. She cried out as she landed on her shoulder, Stress quick to rush over to help her to her feet.\n\u201cYou alright, love?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d False gritted out, rubbing the shoulder she landed on, the ache quickly spreading along her arm, god she hoped she hadn\u2019t broken anything, \u201cYou lot thought of a plan yet?\u201d\n\u201cX\u2019s got somethin\u2019, you still up to fight?\u201d Stress asked, continuing as False nodded at her, \u201cYou and Wels\u2019 gotta get behind \u2018em, can\u2019t let him see you tho, alright?\u201d\nNow that False has been thrown away from him, Joe continued forward towards the others, the trident still sparking with magic in his hand.\n\u201cJoe!\u201d He turned to look at where the noise had come from, spotting Cleo standing in front of the Watcher statue to his left, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta stop, please, you know us! We\u2019re your friends!\u201d\nHe grinned at her plea, something drawing him to her over everyone else. He darted over, moving almost too fast for the others to see and reached his arm out, grabbing the zombie girl\u2019s throat and forcing her back into the statue behind her. He laughed at her shock, not being prepared for him to reach her so fast,\n\u201cOh, of course I know you, Cleo,\u201d He jeered, raising the trident in his other hand towards her,\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI also know that corpses should stay in the ground.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAnd at that, the fear in Cleo\u2019s eyes turned to determination.\n\u201cSCAR, NOW!\u201d\nJoe had no time to react as Scar jumped out from behind the other side of the statue, firing his crossbow at him. The fireworks exploded, sparks and colours and noise throwing him off Cleo, catching him by surprise.\n\u00a0\nThen three things happened at once.\nFalse and Wels grabbed Joe\u2019s arms, keeping him in place.\nCleo darted forwards, grabbing Joe\u2019s mask.\nAnd time stopped for a moment.\nBut the others didn\u2019t know about that last one, so for all intents and purposes, we\u2019ll just pretend only the first two happened.\n\u00a0\nCleo s c r e a m e d.\n\u00a0\nPurple magic crawled through the skin of her fingers, and then her hands, and then her forearms like veins spreading out from where she touched the mask, pain like she had never felt before stabbed at her and she saw white for a moment. But she didn\u2019t let go of the mask, continuing to pull it, she needed to get it off her friend now, this was their chance she needed to save him but god it h u r t\u2014\nAnd then, it was off. Cleo fell backwards, the statue behind her the only thing keeping her upright. She dropped the mask on the ground, stomping on it and breaking it in two. Wels and False held Joe up as he slumped forwards in their arms, going limp, the world around them was quiet, almost too quiet compared to how loud it had just been. Cleo looked up at her friend shakily, stumbling over on unsteady feet.\n\u201c\u2026Joe?\u201d she murmured, reaching out towards him with a trembling hand, and for a horrifying moment, she thought she couldn\u2019t see him breathing-\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Cleo\u2026?\u201d Joe\u2019s voice was small, small enough that she almost didn\u2019t hear it, but she did, and the sound made her burst into tears.\n\u201c\u2026Howdy, Joe.\u201d She chuckled; voice thick with relief and tears she didn\u2019t try to wipe away. The gentle moment was ruined however when Grian called out over the courtyard,\n\u201cWe need to get out of here, now!\u201d\n\u00a0The calm that had settled over the others dissipated. They weren\u2019t out of the woods yet, and with the amount of commotion they had made it was very likely the owners of the castle knew were they were, despite the bracelets.\nCleo tried to pick up the now fully unconscious Joe, yelping at the sudden pain that shot up her arms when she tried to put weight on them. False grabbed him from her quickly, holding him bridle style as she looked at Cleo worryingly. She had no time to ask if she was alright however, as the rest of the group starting rushing towards one of the gates of the courtyard. They caught up with them, following behind Grian as he led them out of the castle and towards the portal.\n\u00a0\nMumbo didn\u2019t trust how easy they had gotten away.\nHe watched as his friends ran into the portal, Grian standing a little in front of it, making sure the others\u00a0got in safely before he would go in himself. Mumbo was the last to run towards it, but he skid to a stop just before he went thought, something feeling off. He turned to look at Grian, and whatever he was going to say vanished before he could open his mouth.\nGrian stared back at him, eye\u2019s swimming with what he could only describe as anguish, his body trembled and tears ran down his face. He looked at his friend and smiled painfully,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I put you all thought this.\u201d He sobbed, and Mumbo realized what was happening, his heart jumped into his throat and eyes went wide,\n\u201cGrian no, GRIAN, WAIT--\" \nMumbo tried desperately to run towards his him, but Grian\u2019s magic surrounded him, and all he could do was watch his friend as he was thrown backwards into the portal.\n\u00a0\nAnd then all he could do was watch at the portal closed, Grian still on the other side.\nGrian watched the portal\u2019s magic flicker and die out in front of him, his friend\u2019s yell still ringing in his ears.\nHe didn\u2019t react to the sound of someone landing behind him. He didn\u2019t react to the hand on his own, pulling him slowly away from the dead portal (away from his friends, his family, his home-). The world was moving in a blur, like he wasn\u2019t really there, like he was dreaming. He\u2019d like this all to be a dream, he\u2019d like to imagine waking up in his house, he\u2019d like to imagine walking outside to see his friends all alive and safe and not in danger. He\u2019d like a lot of things.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not angry with you.\u201d\n\nCrown\u2019s voice snapped him out of his haze slightly, and he realized they were now outside his room, in the castle. He looked up at them, feeling like a child that had just been caught doing something wrong.\n\u201cIn fact, we\u2019re both very proud of you, Diamond.\u201d Crown smiled softly, crouching down to his level, \u201cWhat you did must have been a very hard decision to make, but it was the right one. Now that this little adventure is over, I hope you understand your place here, with us.\u201d \nCrown stood back up and opened the door, gesturing for Grian to walk inside. He did, Crown following close behind. The room was the same as it had been when he\u2019d left, the obsidian walls stretched high above them, end rods draped from the ceiling (like Stress\u2019s castle-- (don\u2019t think about it--)), little trinkets and items were scattered around the room and walls, gifts from Crown and Braid to make him happy, or so they had told him, a large glass door was closed on the wall opposite them, leading out to a balcony.\n\u201cI think Braid wants an apology for what you said to them in your dream, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d Crown chuckled to themself, stepping around to face Grian.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone to readjust in a moment, however, there is one thing I need to do first.\u201d\n\nGrian\u2019s eyes went wide as they pulled his mask from beneath their cloak. He said nothing, forcing his panic down with gritted teeth. Crown didn\u2019t notice his panic, or simply chose to ignore it,\n\n\u201cThis might feel a little overwhelming, but it\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnd with no further warning, Crown pushed the mask onto Grian\u2019s face. Grian felt it instantly, the magic flowing through him and around him, like it was trying to drown him. He clenched his fists, trying to control it before it swallowed him whole. And then it settled, falling into place like it never left. Grian took a moment to breathe before he opened his eyes, looking through the mask was always a strange feeling, he knew it was solid, it felt solid on his face, and from the outside you\u2019d assume there would be no way to see anything through it, yet it didn\u2019t block his vision in the slightest, if only giving everything a slightly purple hue.\nGrian felt something shift on his back, and his eyebrows raised as he noticed his wings folding around his shoulders, almost as if they\u2019d never been gone in the first place. He reached out and touched them lightly, feeling the feathers between his fingers. Crown hummed in approval, smiling down him,\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you alone for now, if you need anything, be sure to come find us, dear.\u201d They said simply, walking over to the door. They paused in the doorway for a moment, looking back over their shoulder,\n\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome home, Grian.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCrown shut the door behind them, and Grian could hear their footsteps retreating down the hall. He stood there, now alone in his room, his surroundings not quite catching up to him. Everything felt hazy around the edges, like it wasn\u2019t quite there. He walked over to his bed, ready to just fall into it and pretend he was somewhere else, when he noticed the clothes laid out on the covers. A purple jumper, like the one he was wearing, some jeans and a purple cloak. He picked up the cloak hesitantly, looking down at the symbol engraved into the pin on the front.\nHe ignored his sob as he took a breath, clutching the fabric in his hands tight.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIskall didn\u2019t know where he was going.\nIt\u2019d been a few days since Grian had left, and everyone was still in shock over it. Despite the signs, no one had really seen it coming, they\u2019d really thought they had been getting through to him but\u2026 apparently not. Iskall sighed, wandering through the desolate shopping district aimlessly, the world felt like a ghost town, everyone seemingly shutting themselves away, whether on purpose or not he wasn\u2019t sure. His train of thought was derailed by a frustrated sounding shout near Sahara. Curious, he walked over. The front of Sahara was still in ruin, no one having the time or want to try and fix it. Iskall frowned when he saw the source of the shouting, being a dishevelled looking Mumbo who had seemed to take to kicking the side of the Watcher portal and swearing at it. Iskall cleared his throat, trying to get the man\u2019s attention.\nMumbo turned to look at his friend, and Iskall\u2019s frown deepened at the sign of him. His hair was a mess, unbrushed and dirty, his clothes were in a similar state, his coat having been discarded and undershirt stained with Redstone. He looked exhausted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh\u2026 Hey.\u201d The man greeted, looking down at Iskall from the platform.\n\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201d Iskall replied slowly, watching the man walk down to him, \u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019re you doing?\u201d\nMumbo blinked, furrowing his eyebrows a little, \u201cI\u2019m trying to restart the portal, and I know what you\u2019re going to say-\u201d he put his hand up in front of him like he was expecting Iskall to interrupt him,\n\u201c-But listen, I know the flint and steel didn\u2019t do anything but-\u201d\n\u201cBro-\u201d Iskall tried to interject, but Mumbo continued to talk over him.\n\u201c-What if we use something that also had some kind of magic property to it? Like\u2026 like an enchantment table? Or-\u201d\n\u201cDude.\u201d\n\u201c-Maybe a beacon? If we light it below the portal and have the beam shoot into it-\u201d\n\u201cMumbo--\"\n\u201c-I mean, even Redstone has to have some kind of magic in it-\u201d\n\n\u201cMumbo. It\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nThe Redstoner stopped rambling, looking at Iskall a little startled. Iskall continued while he had his attention,\n\u201cI know you\u2019re worried, we all are, and we\u2019re all trying to think of something to get him back, but\u2026 this isn\u2019t the way to do it. When\u2019s the last time you slept? Or ate?\u201d\nIskall paused for a moment,\n\u201c\u2026Grian wouldn\u2019t want you to run yourself into the ground for him, dude.\u201d\nMumbo looked at him blankly, a silence fell over the duo as Iskall waited for a response. Then Mumbo sniffled, rubbing his eyes furiously as he teared up. Iskall\u2019s stomach dropped with his face, and he took a step towards his friend,\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry-\u201d\n\u201cNo, no you\u2019re right.\u201d Mumbo croaked, sitting on the steps behind him and putting his head in his hands.\n\u201cHe was right there. He was right there and I couldn\u2019t stop him. I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d His voice broke as he finished talking and Iskall hurried over, sitting next to his friend to put an arm around him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, none of us would\u2019ve been able to stop him.\u201d He rubbed Mumbo\u2019s back, trying to comfort the man the best he could. Mumbo took a deep breath, taking his hands away from his face, which was now red and splotchy from the tears.\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s just- it\u2019s so frustrating, if I had noticed sooner I could\u2019ve\u2026 talked him out of it, or-\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us could\u2019ve talked him out of it, man.\u201d\nMumbo sighed, staring ahead at nothing in particular.\n\u201cWe are going to get him back though,\u201d Iskall reassured, smiling softly, \u201cWe\u2019re going to think of something.\u201d\nMumbo glanced over, face unsure, \u201cAre we? Even if we can get the portal open\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s to say he\u2019ll even come back with us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCleo walked through the hallways of Stress\u2019s castle towards the bedroom. Due to the fact that neither Joe or Cleo had a very secure place for Joe to rest and recover, Stress had kindly offered them to stay with her for the time being. Joe had tried to refuse at first out of politeness, but Cleo had shut that down quickly. She held two bowls of soup in her hands, having had the idea to possibly eat lunch with her friend if he was awake, he\u2019d been in and out of unconscious the first few days, but now he was more awake than not, which Cleo took as a good sign. She grinned as she turned the corner into the bedroom, seeing Joe awake. He was writing something in a book, stopping and putting it down next to him once he noticed her arrival.\n\u201cHowdy, Cleo.\u201d He nodded, smiling as he sat further upright in the bed, taking the soup from her thankfully.\n\u201cHey.\u201d She replied, sitting to face him on the foot of the bed, \u201cYou feelin\u2019 any better, then?\u201d\nThe man sighed, looking down at the soup in his lap, \u201cSorta, the scars don\u2019t ache as much right now\u2026\u201d he mumbled, reaching up to touch his face lightly. The purple lines stretched under his eyes and across his nose, where the mask had touched his face. Cleo grimaced slightly at the sight, thinking of her own scars running up her arms.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Mine\u2019ve stopped hurting for the most part.\u201d She replied, taking a sip of her soup. They sat quietly for a moment, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Cleo glanced at the book sitting next to her friend,\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Are you still having those nightmares?\u201d She asked softly.\nJoe took a moment to respond before nodding,\n\u201cThey\u2019re not as frequent as they were before but, yeah.\u201d He frowned slightly, biting the inside of his cheek, \u201cI\u2026 I think I know what they are now.\u201d\nCleo raised an eyebrow, leaning forward.\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think it was Grian\u2019s old world.\u201d\nThe zombie girl\u2019s brow furrowed, and she looked at Joe confused,\n\u201cWhy\u2019d ya reckon that then?\u201d\nJoe frowned, trying to find the right words, \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to explain\u2026 when I had that mask on, it was kinda like I had taken a back seat in my own head, right? Like the magic was piloting me around and tellin\u2019 me what do, but I was still aware of everythin\u2019 that was going on. Kinda.\u201d\nCleo nodded, continuing to eat her soup,\n\u201cWhen I had that nightmare again, it was almost the same feeling. It was the same dream but this time I knew what was goin\u2019 on, like, I knew where I was in the dream despite me not recognizin\u2019 anything.\u201d\nJoe finished talking, eating some of his soup.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 you just knew you were in Grian\u2019s old world?\u201d Cleo asked, trying to make sense of it in her head.\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cThat is strange\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nJoe hummed in agreement, and the two fell back into silence. After a moment Joe looked over to Cleo, an unsure expression on his face,\n\u201cI did\u2026 wanna tell you something, actually.\u201d He muttered, avoiding eye contact. Cleo nodded her head, gesturing for him to continue. He took a breath before continuing,\n\u201cI just. I wanted to say sorry, for everything I did\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou stop right there, Joe Hills.\u201d Cleo interrupted abruptly, putting her food down beside her to look at her friend dead in the eye,\n\u201cYou have absolutely nothing to apologize for.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I do, Cleo!\u201d Joe blurted out suddenly, as if he\u2019d been holding it in for the whole conversation, \u201cI have got so much to apologize for. I\u2019ve gotta say sorry to False for throwing her across the room, I\u2019ve gotta apologize to you for what I\u2019ve done to your arms, I\u2019ve gotta apologise to everyone for trying to kill them,\u201d His worlds grew more frantic as he spoke, and Cleo was a little taken aback at the sudden outburst,\n\u201cAnd I would say sorry to Grian, but cause of me he\u2019s not here!\u201d\n\u201cJoe, stop it,\u201d Cleo said firmly, moving down the bed to sit closer to her friend. She grabbed his hands in her own, \u201cOi, Look at me.\u201d\nJoe reluctantly did, his face still grimacing, eyes swimming with guilt.\n\u201cYou did nothing wrong. And I know where you\u2019re coming from, yeah? But you said it yourself, you didn\u2019t have any control over your actions. You were a victim in this as much as everyone else was. Those Watchers coulda taken any one of us and it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been that person\u2019s fault either. You know who\u2019s fault it is? Those things that forced you to do all that in the first place.\u201d\nCleo\u2019s face softened slightly as she spoke, \u201cDo you blame me for not wakin\u2019 up when you got taken? Do you blame Grian for bringing all this with \u2018em in the first place?\u201d\nJoe sighed, looking away from her, \u201cNo, course I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Cleo nodded firmly, \u201cSo don\u2019t go throwing yourself under the bus when you got no reason to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI doubt there\u2019s ever a good reason to throw yourself under a bus. Unless maybe you\u2019re hiding from something.\u201d Joe mused, a small smile cracking onto his face.\nCleo laughed, \u201cWhy would ya first option be under the bus? Why not inside it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the bus is locked and you\u2019re in a rush, and you\u2019ve gotta hush cause you\u2019ve had a brush with something dangerous.\u201d\nCleo laughed harder this time, leaning back on the bed. Joe chuckled with her; troubles momentarily forgotten. As their laughter died down Cleo got to her feet, picking up the empty bowls,\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit, gotta put these back.\u201d\nJoe nodded, face falling a little, \u201cI think\u2026 I just wish I didn\u2019t feel so useless right now\u2026\u201d\nCleo sighed, a small, sympathetic smile on her face, \u201cI\u2019m with you on that one.\u201d\nShe went to turn around, only to stumble slightly on the side of the carpet, falling backward with a yelp,\n\u00a0\nAnd then she wasn\u2019t falling.\nCleo stared at Joe with wide eyes, and Joe stared right back at her, his hands held out towards her instinctively when she had fallen. Except Joe\u2019s hands were glowing, the same purple colour as the magic surrounding her. And then in the next moment, the magic was gone, and Cleo landed on the ground, eyes still wide and unbelieving. They two sat in silence for a moment,\n\u201cWe... we need to get the others. Now.\u201d\nThe sky was grey, the same as it had been for the last week. Overcast and cloudy, fog seemingly everywhere, and it fit the mood that hung over the hermits like a blanket, almost like the world itself was mourning with them. Maybe mourning isn\u2019t the right word, but it sure was what it looked like, to Mumbo at least. After his chat with Iskall, he\u2019d spend a majority of his time near his farms, just trying to keep himself occupied. Building and fixing his machines, sometimes breaking them on purpose just so he\u2019d have something to do, something to distract himself. He almost ignored his communicator when it went off, but curiosity got the best of him, and whatever hesitance he had was gone when he saw the message.\nZombieCleo: u guys need to come to stress\u2019s castle now, its \u2018bout grian\nWithout a second thought, he took to the sky in the direction of Stress\u2019s base.\n\u00a0\nHe was one of the first there thanks to an overuse of fireworks, spotting Cleo and Joe on top of the castle, Stress standing nearby. He landed, a little wobbly in his haste, in front of them,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cGive it a minute, gotta wait for the others,\u201d Cleo replied, looking off into the horizon. They arrived soon enough, all just as interested as Mumbo to know what was going on.\nCleo wasted no time, holding a bowl out in front of her,\n\u201cWatch.\u201d\nShe gave a small nod to Joe before dropping it. Joe reached out towards it and it stopped mid-air, a purple glow that the others knew by then to be magic surrounding it, the glow flickering a few times before disappearing, letting the bowl fall to the ground. The group stared at it in shock for a moment, Mumbo speaking up to say what everyone was thinking,\n\u201cYou have magic.\u201d He breathed, \u201cHow, how do you have magic?\u201d\n\u201cThe mask,\u201d Joe answered, pushing his broken glassed up his nose slightly, \u201cI think it\u2019s remnants of the magic the mask was feedin\u2019 me. When Cleo took the mask off it\u2019s like it got severed somehow, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s temporary or not but for now, it\u2019s here.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Iskall gasped, drawing the others attention to him, \u201cYou could open the portal!\u201d\nThe other hermits\u2019 eyes went wide at the realization, Mumbo taking a step towards the castle\u2019s edge, rocket in hand.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we all still doing here then? Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, hold on a second,\u201d Doc objected, \u201cWe can\u2019t go rushing into this without a plan. Plus, we don\u2019t have Grian with us this time, we\u2019re going in completely blind.\u201d\n\u201cWell, not completely blind,\u201d Ren shrugged, \u201cWe know where he\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but we also know what else is going to be there with him. We didn\u2019t even see a Watcher last time and we still got our butts kicked.\u201d\nJoe looked at the ground, frowning slightly. Doc sighed, looking between Mumbo and Ren.\n\u201cLook, even with a plan, last time we lost someone. We\u2019ve got a chance to get him back and we can\u2019t waste it by rushing into that place again. We need to think of something more\u2026 thought-out.\u201d\nThe others nodded, despite how much Mumbo wanted to run over to the portal now, Doc was right. they couldn\u2019t rush into this, especially seeing how this might be their only chance.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGrian could feel Braid approach more than hear them, recognizing their magic in the hall outside. He tried to ignore it, hoping that they\u2019d just walk past his door, but Grian wasn\u2019t really getting what he wanted recently, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise when they stopped outside his door and opened it, not even bothering to knock. He was lying on his bed facing away from them, having not really bothered to move much outside of eating whatever food Crown would give him, not really seeing the point to. It wasn\u2019t as if he was trying to be difficult, or maybe he was, he didn\u2019t know. Or care. He didn\u2019t bother looking at Braid as they sat down on the side of his bed. It\u2019d been a few days since he\u2019d last seen them, having had to go \u201capologize\u201d to them for his \u201crude behaviour\u201d, and he was a little miffed at being in their presence again.\n\u201cI have something for you,\u201d Braid announced, tapping Grian\u2019s shoulder lightly from where he lay under the covers of his bed. After a moment he rolled over, looking at Braid through his mask, not bothering to hide his glare that they couldn\u2019t see. The Watcher held out their hand lightly, palm facing the ground, then they whistled a simple tune, continuing to face Grian as the little song finished. A silence fell between them and Grian furrowed his brows, confused as to what was going on-\nSomething moved out of the corner of his eye, and he sat up in bed as he watched a bird fly through the doorway of his room, landing on Braids outstretched hand. It was beautiful, different than any other kind of bird he\u2019d ever seen, its black feathers shining in the dim light, and Grian could see purple feathers under its wings when it shifted on its perch. Braid whistled the tune again, and the bird mimicked it, bobbing its head from side to side like it was dancing.\n\u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d Braid asked, holding the bird towards Grian. He hesitated for a moment, eyeing the bird and Braid wearily before slowly holding his hand out, watching the bird jump from Braid\u2019s hand to his. It cocked its head at him, looking at his wings folded up behind him, ruffling its own a few times. Grian smiled slightly, ruffling his own wings back at it.\n\u00a0\nThen the bird burst into a purple flame.\n\u00a0\nGrian shrieked as he threw the bird away from himself, pulling his legs towards him and pushing himself further up the bed. he gaped in a kind of confused horror as it flapped around on the bed for a moment, as if it was trying to put itself out, and then just like that it was gone, the fire swallowing it whole. For a moment all Grian could hear was his own shuddering breaths, still trying to process what had just happened, then a loud cackle broke through the air, Braid doubling over themself as they laughed, Grian watched as they did, his heart beating loud and fast in his chest. They quieted down, their laughter slowing into a giggle as they turned back to look at Grian, seeing the look on his face and pouting dramatically,\n\u201cOh, Diamond, what\u2019s with that face? It was a harmless joke is all!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHarmless?\u201d Grian choked out, voice trembling slightly, \u201cYou just- you killed--\u201d\n\u201cOh please! It was just a bird! Millions of them exist, Diamond, if you want an actual bird you can go get one yourself!\u201d Braid sighed, as if they were disappointed in Grian\u2019s reaction to their\u2026 joke. They stood up and faced Grian, their looming figure made even more prominent as Grian craned his neck up to look at them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been days, Diamond. Crown might have more patience with you than I but even they are growing tired of this. We have given you time to adjust, but that time has run out, so, smarten up. Realize that this is your life, and that you are a Watcher, and that you need to start acting like one. When you\u2019re ready to do that, maybe you will stop wallowing in your own despair so pathetically.\u201d\nGrian watched shell shocked as Braid turned on their heels and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind them. Grian flinched at the noise. He blinked at the now empty room, staring at the door for a few moments before slowly turning his gaze back to the bed, where the bird had been a minute prior. Any evidence of the bird ever existing was gone, either burnt with the flame or\u2026 the bird might not have been real at all, all a trick from Braid to get under his skin. He\u2019d like to believe so, that he hadn\u2019t just seen\u2026 he took his mask off for a second, rubbing his eyes as he grimaced at the thought, the birds last few moments playing over in his head.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d let his guard down, that had been his first mistake. He\u2019d let himself get carried away with believing that Braid might\u2019ve been doing something out of the goodness of their heart, he couldn\u2019t do that again, or something bigger than a bird might get hurt.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019d taken a few days, but the hermits had what they thought was the best plan they could come up with, they\u2019d pushed the time as far as they could, the worry that Joe\u2019s magic might leave him at any point hanging over their heads like a cloud. Their biggest advantage, they realized, was the bracelets Grian had made for them, with them on the Watchers wouldn\u2019t be able to sense their presence in The End, giving them the element of surprise. (Ren snorted, \u201cMore like the element of not dying as fast-- ow!\u201d Ren rubbed his arm where Stress had smacked him, cringing away from the look she was giving him). The sky was clear on the day they met up outside the portal, a change from the overcast and gloom of the days prior, it almost didn\u2019t fit the atmosphere of the meetup, every hermit armed to the teeth, despite the feeling of unease and fear that sat in each of their stomachs.\nThey went over the plan one more time. It was less one distinct idea and more a series of\u2026 what-ifs. In truth they had no idea how any of this would go, so their best course of action was to try and find a solution to any kind of outcome, what do if a Watcher found them, what to do if Grian wasn\u2019t going to come back with them, what to do if one of them got taken or injured. A lot of these plans, much to Mumbo\u2019s annoyance, ended with \u201cRun back to the portal as fast as you can, Grian or no\u201d, but he understood why, all he could do was hope it didn\u2019t come to that, and if it did, that Joe would be able to open the portal again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs everyone ready then?\u201d Xisuma called out from near the portal, Joe standing anxiously next to him, the man rubbed his hands together subconsciously, trying to calm his nerves. The others nodded, ready as they\u2019d ever be, and walked up the stairs towards them.\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Joe.\u201d X smiled at his friend, Joe tried to smile back, turning into more of a grimace as he walked closer to the deactivated portal.\nHe kneeled in front of it, trying to calm his breathing and thoughts, focusing on the feeling inside of himself, the feeling he felt when he\u2019d caught Cleo. He put his hands on the bottom of the portal, leaning into it. He could feel the feeling inside of him swell, like waves crashing onto a beach just before a storm, growing higher and higher as the air around him felt more electric and his hands sparked to life, crawling up and around his arms and body\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n-a person attacking him with a sword and not stopping he threw them and they crumpled to the ground-\n\n\u00a0\nHe gasped at the memory, eyes opening and breath speeding up as he tried to keep focus on the task at hand, he couldn\u2019t mess this up he needed this to work-\n\u00a0\n\n-he had his hand on someone neck he was going to kill them he couldn\u2019t stop it he couldn\u2019t stop it he couldn\u2019t STOP IT-\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Joe!\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know who\u2019s voice it was, from behind him, but he clung onto the noise, repeating it over in his head as he tried to push out the memories. The magic was almost overwhelming now, but still not enough, like something was blocking a dam, holding him back, with gritted teeth he pushed against it harder, letting out a yell as he felt it yield, and for a moment all he saw was white.\nJoe was thrown backward, sparks shooting from the spot he had been focusing on as the portal flickered awake, basking them in a purple glow. Cleo rushed over to Joe, who was out cold, lifting him into her lap as the others half ran to them half ran to the portal, suddenly not sure whether to go or stay and see if their friend was alright. Cleo looked at them desperately,\n\u201cHurry up then! I\u2019ll stay and make sure he\u2019s alright, you lot need to go, now!\u201d She grabbed the bracelet from her wrist, thrusting it into Iskall\u2019s hands, \u201cI\u2019m not going to need it, maybe you guys will, I\u2019ll keep watch from this side! Go get that idiot!\u201d\nCleo watched as they nodded, running into the portal. As the last of them entered, the world around her was suddenly quiet, only the faint hum of the portal and her friends breathing breaking the silence. She held him tighter, looking at the portal with anxious eyes,\n\u00a0\n\nPlease let them be alright. Please.\n\nThe Hermits knew where they were going this time, not needing Grian\u2019s guidance to navigate the almost maze of towers and castles around them. They found the right castle easy enough, making their way into the building quietly, again confronted by its cold, dark atmosphere. The group had two options now, either split up to try and cover more ground and find Grian faster or stay in one group to lessen the chance of confronting a Watcher alone. In the end, they decided it was probably safer to stick together, and with that, they began their journey deeper into the castle. They walked up the stairs and into the hallway they had gone through the last time they were there, none of them had any idea where a good place to start would be, so following in their own footsteps seemed like a good idea, at least they\u2019d know what to expect at first that way.\nThey peered around the corner at the end of the hallway, looking at the large, dark wooden door in front of them. Mumbo edged closer to it, grabbing the handle and opening it slightly, just enough to look inside. From what he could see it was empty, but just as he was about to open it more, he stopped.\nA Watcher stood on the other side of the room, looking out a window with it's back facing the door. Mumbo felt frozen, it hadn\u2019t noticed them as far as he could tell, so as slow as he could he shut the door again, turning to face the others,\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Watcher in there.\u201d He whispered, gesturing with his hands to move away from the door. They did, slowly walking backwards, trying to make as little noise as possible. Walking backwards, however, was probably not the best idea, because when you accidentally drop a sword onto the stone ground after being run into, it makes quite a loud noise, loud enough to make everyone around you stop and flinch. Ren was quick to crouch down and pick up his dropped sword, he held his breath with the others as they stood there frozen for a moment, wide eyes looking between each other. A few seconds passed, an agonizing quiet blanketing the group as they waited to see if anything would happen, and when nothing did, they continued walking away from the door-\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow isn\u2019t this interesting?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe door had been flung open, and standing in the doorway was the Watcher. It was smiling down at them, the smile almost too large for its face, its expression was hidden by the mask, but that didn\u2019t make it any less intimidating. The Hermits were frozen for a moment, and before they could try and escape the familiar glow of magic surrounded them, and suddenly they were standing in the ballroom, the door to their left swinging shut.\n\u00a0\nIskall tried to keep his breathing quiet as he sprinted down the hallway. He had been far enough at the back of the group that the Watcher hadn\u2019t seemed to notice him slip away, and as guilty as he felt leaving his friends there, he needed to find Grian, he was the only one that stood a chance against the Watcher, and if he didn\u2019t find him soon- if he didn\u2019t-\nIskall pushed the thought out of his head, he couldn\u2019t think about that, not now. He ran around another corner into another hallway, skidding to a stop outside a door. He reached for the handle, hand pausing over it, for all he knew there could be another Watcher behind this door as well, or two, or a hundred, and he was all on his own. He took a deep breath, he couldn\u2019t hesitate, the longer he took finding his friend the more dangerous it became for all of them, he grabbed the handle and pushed the door open slightly, looking inside.\nThe inside looked like some kind of bedroom, and his eyes were drawn to the bed near the wall, spotting something lying in the sheets, facing away from the door. The purple wings almost made him close the door there and then, not wanting to be caught, but something made him stop. He squinted at the figure, they looked very small compared to the Watcher he had seen in the ballroom\u2026\nIskall almost laughed in relief as he realized that it was Grian, opening the door fully and shutting it behind him,\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrian!\u201d\nThe man in question shot up in his bed, whipping his head around to look at his friend, Iskall\u2019s heart skipping a beat at the sight of the mask, his fear lessening slightly as Grian pulled the mask off his face, staring at him in shock. He stumbled out of bed, moving around it to stand in the middle of the room. Iskall took a step towards him, and Grian took a step back, eyebrows furrowing, his hand lit up for a moment, and Iskall glanced down at it,\n\u201cUh\u2026 Grian?\u201d\nGrian continued to look at him, and after a moment the magic in his hand died down, and his eyebrows raised,\n\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re actually here, how- what? How?\u201d Grian stuttered, taking a few steps towards him, \u201cIskall, how the fuck are you here?\u201d \n\u201cI know you\u2019re confused and possibly angry but I don\u2019t have any time to explain, we need to get to the others, one of the Watchers found us and-\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Grian shouted, wings twitching slightly. He sighed, loud and panicked, \u201cWhere? Where are they?\u201d\n\u201cThe ballroom, I\u2014\u201d\nIskall was cut off by Grian rushing past him, grabbing his hand as he opened the door and pulled him along down the hall. They both reached the room quickly, and Grian swore as he tried to pull it open, the door not bugging. He took a few steps back, lifting his hand towards it and, with no further warning, shot at it with his magic. It exploded open, wood flying outwards into the ballroom and sending smoke into the air. The duo ran into the room, pausing at the scene in front of them.\n\u00a0\nBraid had Stress by the hair, lifting her off the ground slightly as she struggled against them, the other Hermits unable to move past the magic keeping them in place, powerless to stop it. Braid grinned at her pained expression, a staff held in their other hand, it was white, glowing bright enough with magic that it was difficult to look at. The end of it was pointed under Stress\u2019s chin, tilting her head up towards Braid.\nGrian felt the world almost slow down, a million thoughts rushing around his head as he stared at them, and before he could think twice, he raised his hand out, firing his magic at Braid. It hit their arm, and they dropped Stress in shock, Stress yelping as she fell to the ground. Iskall dashed towards her, helping her to her feet and away from the Watcher. Braid stared at their arm for a moment, the skin where they had been hit charred and smoking slightly, and Grian felt his heart jump into his throat as they started laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh! Has our little Diamond grown a spine?\u201d They giggled, turning to face Grian properly, their movements jumpy and almost\u2026 inhuman as they moved towards him, \u201cDo you want to dance, Diamond? We are in a ballroom after all! Come on!\u201d\nGrian trembled as he stood his ground, his hands lighting up as he prepared himself for a fight, he didn\u2019t get a chance to do anything, however, as Braid grabbed him with their own magic and threw him into the wall opposite them, Grian crying out at the impact. The other Hermits yelled out to him, still unable to move despite how hard they struggled against the magic. Grian\u2019s ears were ringing as he pushed himself to his feet, the world around him spinning as he stumbled away from the wall. Braid walked towards him, summoning another staff and throwing it at him, Grian blocking it with a shield only just in time.\nBraid sighed dramatically, \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying! This is why we had to kill your friends the first time, Diamond!\u201d They grabbed Grian again with their magic, lifting him into the air slightly before slamming him into the ground, the floor denting slightly at the impact.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even summon a weapon, and you continue to hold back even when your life is being threatened!\u201d Braid stopped walking towards him, smile growing larger as they looked over at the immobilized Hermits scattered around the room,\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not your life that needs to be threatened.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFaster than the eye could see, Braid teleported over to the nearest Hermit.\n\u00a0\nThat Hermit being Mumbo.\n\u00a0\nAnd for a moment he and Grian made eye contact, Grian unsteadily lifting himself off the floor.\n\u00a0\nThen Mumbo squeezed his eyes shut, tensing up as Braid raised their staff towards him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMumbo hesitantly opened his eyes after a moment, the air around him shifting as he felt something move in front of him.\nGrian stood between him and Braid, wings spread out behind him like some kind of barrier. He had a staff in his hands, one end going straight through Braid's chest. They choked on their breath, purple liquid running down the end of the staff and dripping on the floor. Grian pushed the staff further into their chest, hands shaking and eyes stony, and Braid coughed wetly, the purple substance (blood?) splattered onto his face. Braid staggered to their knees, one hand holding the weapon in their chest for support. The two were level with each other now, and Braid laughed lightly,\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Full of\u2026 surprises\u2026 aren\u2019t you, Diamond?\u201d They slurred, leaning forward towards Grian, \u201cI\u2019ve got a\u2026 surprise for you too\u2026 wanna hear it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nAnd with that, Braid went still, slumping forward onto the ground as Grian pulled the staff out of their chest. The room was quiet, everyone star stuck as Braid\u2019s body began to glow, purple particles flying into the sky as their body disappeared, until all that was left was a mask and a pool of blood. Grian looked at it for a moment before taking a step towards it, stamping on it with his foot, and breaking it in two.\nThe Hermits, finding that they could move again, slowly walked towards their friend.\n\u201cAre you alright, Grian?\u201d Mumbo asked softly, reaching out towards him.\nThere was no time to answer, as a loud, mournful wail rang out through the castle. The group glanced around the room, startled, and Grian swore quietly as he turned to face them.\n\u201cGet behind me, now.\u201d He shouted, stumbling further away from the broken doorway, the panic in his eyes quickly prompting the others to do as he said, forming a group behind him. Grian grabbed his mask from his inventory and put it on, his staff in hand and magic zapping around him. Mumbo had seen him use magic before, enough now that it didn\u2019t even phase him, but this\u2026\nGrian looked dangerous.\nBut as scary as he looked, Mumbo could see his knuckles go white as he clung to the staff.\n\u00a0\nHe was scared, God he was so scared, but he couldn\u2019t let that show, not now. He needed to keep his friends safe, his stupid, stupid friends that should\u2019ve never come back for him. His thoughts were cut off by Crown, who teleported into the room across from them. They only stood there for a moment before spotting the broken mask on the ground, letting out another cry as they ran towards it. They knelt in front of it, grabbing one of the broken pieces in their trembling hand. Their breathing was ragged, thick with anger and sorrow, nothing like the calm and collected Crown Grian knew.\nThey looked up at him from across the floor, and he didn\u2019t need to see their eyes to go cold at their stare.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\u031a\u0330\u0349 Y\u034b\u0329\u0353o\u0322\u031d\u0354u\u0353\u0334\u0312.\u0343\u036b \u201d\u0358\u0351\u0307\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 BRAT!\u201d \nGrian\u2019s stomach lurched as he was thrown off his feet towards Crown, their hands gripping around his throat once he was close enough. He tried to gasp for air as their grip tightened, their sharp claws digging into his neck with no restraint. He grabbed their hand instinctively, trying to pull it off him, and when that didn\u2019t work, he lifted his legs, using the momentum to kick at Crown with as much force as possible. He landed a good kick to their chest, startling them enough that he was able to pull himself out of their grasp and into the air, trying to gasp for breath through his now bruising neck. He didn\u2019t have long, however, Crown throwing themself into the sky after him as soon as they steadied themself, Grian darting out of their way just in time. He tried to fly over to the other side of the room, however flying with an elytra was very different than flying with actual wings, and he hadn\u2019t had a chance to relearn how to use them, Crown, on the other hand, had been using their wings their whole life, so catching up to Grian wasn\u2019t all that hard.\n\u00a0\nGrian had no time to react as he felt Crown grab his wings, yelping as he was yanked backward. He struggled in their grip for a moment before he was falling, still tight in the Watchers grasp, and all he could do was tense as he was forced face-first into the ground, Crown landing harshly on his back. The wind was knocked out of him, he tried to take a breath as his head spun, Crowns voice splitting through the haze only just,\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you quite realize what you\u2019ve done.\u201d They spat, leaning in close to his ear. He tried to push himself off the ground but was stopped by Crowns weight, gasping as a hand on his head forced his face back into the ground, their knee digging into his back painfully.\n\n\u201cBecause of your actions, I\u2019ve got to punish you. An eye for an eye, don\u2019t you think, Grian? One of your pathetic, puny, insignificant friends in exchange for what you\u2019ve just taken from me? And this time, I\u2019m going to make you w a t c h--\u201d\n\nCrown flinched slightly as an arrow landed in their arm. They looked at it for a moment before pulling it out and snapping it in their hand, looking over at whoever had just fired at them. Grian\u2019s head was yanked around in the same direction, Crown forcing him to look over at his friends.\nFalse stood with her arm outstretched, bow tight in her hand.\nCrown brought their face down to Grian\u2019s again, \u201cLook at that, we have a volunteer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCrown threw his head back into the hard ground, Grian groaning at the impact, his ears ringing. The Watcher stood, their hand not even moving as they grabbed the other hermits with their magic, forcing all but False to their knees. False tried to stand her ground, shoving her feet into the floor as she was dragged towards the Watcher. Crown stood tall before her, smiling down at her as they summoned a staff in their hand, holding it up to her cheek. False\u2019s eyes watered at its light, turning away from it as Crown dragged it across her face lightly, the slightest touch leaving a cut on her cheek. Crown chuckled at the sight of it,\n\u201cOh, the Queen of hearts and body parts looks to be a little afraid! Where\u2019s the brave face of yours?\u201d\nFalse laughed lightly, looking up at Crown through squinted eyes, \u201cYou know, for a group that calls themselves \u2018Watchers\u2019, you lot really aren\u2019t all that observant.\u201d\nCrown\u2019s eyebrows furrowed behind their mask, their confusion cut off by a stabbing pain in their back, and they let go of False as they turned to look behind them. There stood Impulse, sword in hand, the end of it lodged firmly in Crown\u2019s back. The Watcher cried out in annoyance, throwing both False and Impulse away from them.\n\u201cHow did you--\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Crown was cut off by Ren, who was looking at them with a slight glint in his eyes, \u201cYou do know enderpearls exist, right? Were you so caught up in your little fight with Grian that you didn\u2019t notice there were less people over here? Might want to get your eyes checked, dude.\u201d The other hermits laughed slightly at Ren\u2019s remark, still pinned to the ground.\nCrown growled, shoulders tensing and hand lighting up as they looked at Ren, \u201cAnd you should get that tongue of yours looked at, or perhaps I should just remove it all together--\"\n\u00a0\nCrown was cut off again, this time by being thrown through a window to their right. The rest of the hermits stared at the hole in the glass a little shocked, and finding that they could again move, they got to their feet. Grian was also on his feet, barely, standing in the middle of the room holding most of his weight against the staff planted firmly into the ground. He was breathing heavily, and he definitely looked worse for wear, his jumper ripped and face bruised and bloody.\n\u201c\u2026Nothing I say\u2026 is going to make you all go home\u2026 is it?\u201d he mummed between breaths, his expression hidden by his mask but still recognizably defeated.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Doc replied, his grin bright and unapologetic.\nGrian sighed, painfully, \u201c\u2026Right.\u201d he stumbled slightly closer, still using the staff as a crutch.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be back here any second now, and they\u2019re not going to hold back. Don\u2019t get close, if you\u2019re able to, you won't be able to kill them but that doesn\u2019t mean you can't hurt them. Just\u2026 I need an opening to get them unguarded.\u201d\nThe other hermits nodded, spreading out over the ballroom. Grian shut his eyes, letting himself feel for the magic surrounding him. It was more powerful now, maybe because of the adrenaline, or maybe because he was currently running on magic and pure will alone at this point, whatever it was, he was grateful for it. He summoned another staff, gripping it tight his hand just before he felt a surge of magic to the side of him, calling out for the others to get away from the wall a second before it exploded inwards. Crown flew in through the hole, magic dancing around their body like lightning, their head scanning around the room until they found Grian, darting towards him with a screech, all sense of self seemingly lost in the moment as they threw themself at him with wild abandoned. Grian summoned a shield, stumbling back behind it as he tried to keep it intact.\n\u00a0\nCrown\u2019s attention was drawn away from Grian by a series of fireworks shot into their back (their back, Grian realized, that still had Impulse\u2019s sword in it), and without thinking twice, Crown whipped around, rushing towards Scar who stood on the other side of the room, his crossbow still pointed towards them. Scar stood frozen in place for a moment, mind stuttering at the image of 7-or-so foot tall, animalistic creature rushing towards him. He stood frozen for long enough that Cub panicked, looking between his friend and the Watcher for a moment before deciding that he needed to do something.\nThat something, apparently, being to get between the two, and punch the Watcher as hard as be could. Which was pretty damn hard. Crown stumbled back, their mask thrown from their face at the impact, and the Hermits stood in shock at their face.\nDozens of eyes stared back at them, each differing in size and having no real symmetry to them. The lack of a mask truly made them look otherworldly, along with the tattered and tangled hair and magic still zapping around them, it was an image of something unhinged.\n\u00a0\nIt was exactly what Grian needed.\n\u00a0\nAs quickly as he could, he ran up behind Crown, crying out as he stabbed them through the back with his staff. Crown screamed, trying to turn around but unable to as Grian grabbed at the other staff in his hand, stabbing that one through their chest as well. Crown choked for a moment, stumbling backwards and onto the ground, laying on their side, barely keeping themself upright with their hands.\nThe room grew quiet, the hermits shuffling further behind Grian, the man looking down through his mask at Crown. Neither said anything for a moment, the only sound between them being their laboured breathing. then Crown laughed, wet with blood that tricked down their chin and into the growing puddle of purple beneath them,\n\u201c\u2026Never thought you had it in you\u2026 Diamond\u2026\u201d They chuckled weakly; their lidded eyes pinned solely to Grian. Grian\u2019s were still hidden by his mask, his visible face blank as he looked down at the Watcher.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re\u2026 more alike than you thought--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing like you.\u201d Grian interrupted, voice croaky and dry. Crown hummed thoughtfully, sinking further to the ground as their strength drained from them.\n\u201cWhatever you want to tell yourself\u2026\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, and Grian thought about his next words carefully.\n\u201cWhy did\u2026 out of everyone in Evo\u2026\u201d He stuttered slightly, hands clenching weakly, \u201cWhy\u2019d you take me?\u201d\nCrown was quiet for a moment, looking at the floor as they thought about their answer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were\u2026 different\u2026 everyone else we had ever come across\u2026 had eventually yielded to our power; our presence. You\u2026 you didn\u2019t,\u201d they were quiet for another moment, \u201cI suppose\u2026 We wanted to know\u2026 what would break you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Guess you\u2019ll never find out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCrown didn\u2019t respond, their body already fading away, leaving nothing but the mask. Grian shuffled towards it, not having the energy in him to break it himself, he summoned one last staff, lifting it in front of him and ramming it through the middle of the mask, breaking it two.\n\u00a0\nMumbo watched his friend stand there for a moment, leaning on the staff heavily. He was about to call out to him-\nAnd then Grian was falling.\nMumbo\u2019s eyes widened, rushing forward toward him. He didn\u2019t make it in time to catch him, kneeling down beside Grian who was trying to keep himself off the ground.\n\u201cAre you- are you alright?\u201d\nMumbo\u2019s worried question was cut off by distant noises from outside, and Grian swore quietly, taking the mask off his face. Mumbo flinched at the sight of him, without the mask obscuring his face he could really see the damage Crown had done,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now?\u201d Xisuma asked, looking out the hole in the wall.\n\u201cOther Watchers\u2026 now that Braid and Crown are gone, this territory\u2019s up for grabs\u2026 and we do not want to be here when they come to fight for it.\u201d Grian explained, voice slurred slightly. Mumbo helped him to his feet, one of his hands under the shorter man for him to lean on. The hermits ran into the hallway towards the entrance, Mumbo and Grian following slowly behind, Grian leaning most of his weight onto his friend beside them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMumbo\u2026-\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re about to tell me to leave you behind, just shut up now.\u201d\nGrian clamped his mouth shut, looking away from his friend in a huff. They continued down the hallway as fast as they could, making it to the staircase near the entrance before Grian gasped painfully, tripping slightly onto the ground. Mumbo leaned down to help Grian sit on the ground, propping him up against the wall in front of the stairs. Grian clutched at his side, face twisted up in pain. Mumbo moved his hands, breathing in deeply at the sight. The left side of his jumper was covered in blood, seeping out from a wound on his stomach.\n\u201cYou, you stupid, stupid bloody idiot, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone,\u201d Mumbo stuttered, pulling Grian\u2019s jumper off him to get a closer look at the injury, leaving him in his undershirt.\n\u201cWe needed to\u2026 get out of there.\u201d Grian slurred, trying hard to keep his head from falling forward, resorting to just leaning it back on the wall along with the rest of him. Mumbo pushed Grian jumper over the wound, trying to stop the bleeding somewhat. The noises from outside, now recognizable as dozens of voices screaming and screeching, were getting closer, and Mumbo was trying desperately to think of how to get Grian out of there without hurting him more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cM-Mumbo I\u2019ve\u2026. Gotta tell you s\u2019mthin\u2019\u2026\u201d Grian slurred more, having to actively work to keep his eyes open now\n\u201cYou can tell me when we get home,\u201d Mumbo muttered, typing something into his communicator, hoping beyond hope someone would see it and respond.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s important\u2026 please.\u201d Grian whined, and Mumbo sighed weakly, looking at his friend with slightly watery eyes, his face as tense as the rest of him.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m Poultry Man.\u201d Grian laughed lightly, cringing slightly at the movement. Mumbo also laughed, startled and choked up, the tears in his eyes actively spilling over now,\n\u201cDon\u2019t- Don\u2019t be ridiculous, there\u2019s\u2026 no way you could be Poultry Man.\u201d The Redstoner smiled a small smile, though it turned into more of a grimace. It was enough for Grian though, he made him laugh, which was what he was going for.\nThe world around Grian grew dull, and he could faintly hear Mumbo calling his name, but he sounded too far away now, maybe he\u2019d left him there to get back to the portal, he hoped so, he needed them to stay safe\u2026\n\u00a0\nThen Grian\u2019s world went dark.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd suddenly, Grian\u2019s world was white.\n\u00a0\nGrian opened his eyes, less tired and less in pain. In fact, he wasn\u2019t in pain at all. He furrowed his brow, looking out at the vast expanse of white around him, it was like one of his infinity room but\u2026 something told him that this place probably did span on forever.\nHe sat up, head spinning slightly as he tried to distinguish up from down,\n\u201cHello, Grian.\u201d\nGrian froze. He turned his head slowly in the direction of the voice, breath caught in his throat. His voice was small, like he didn\u2019t believe the word he was about to say,\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Netty?\u201d\n\nGrian just\u2026 stared, gawked maybe is the better word. It was like his brain had malfunctioned, what he was seeing hadn\u2019t caught up to him yet. He\u2019d had thoughts about something like this before, that one of these days he was well and truly going to lose it and start seeing hallucinations of his dead friends or something, the Universe\u2019s last hurrah before it broke him for good. He didn\u2019t move when Netty \n\n(was it her? Was she really here?)\n\n slowly sat down in front of him, but he almost looks away at the sight of her sitting on well\u2026 nothing, they were both sitting on nothing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGrian\u2026?\u201d her voice was soft, it had always been soft, even when she was laughing or telling him off, there had always been that underlying kindness to it that made her so approachable, so friendly. She reached out to him, and gently, so gently, placed her hand over his.\n\n\nHe looked down at her hand, it felt warm, alive.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026Where are we?\u201d he asks quietly, still too dazed to really think properly, \u201cAm\u2026 am I\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, no you\u2019re not dead.\u201d Netty reassured, \u201cI think\u2026 this place might be some sort of in-between maybe\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian nodded slowly, continuing to look down at their hands, there was a part of him that was scared if he looked up, she\u2019d disappear. He felt his stomach drop for a moment, he might not be dead, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 God, Netty, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d his voice broke, strained and desperate with emotion. There were nights, the very bad nights when he had first just joined Hermitcraft, where he\u2019d stay up and think about what he\u2019d say to his friends if he\u2019d get the chance. None of those nights ever ended in forgiveness. Now that he was here and he had a chance to say something, he found himself at lost of words, his mouth opening and shutting as he tried to find something to explain how sorry he was for what happened and how they could hate him and he hated himself too and-\n\n\n\u201cGrian, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Netty\u2019s voice cut off his train of thought, and he finally looked up at her, she was smiling, eyes soft and forgiving, \u201cNo one blames you, and no one should. We love you Grian, please never think otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd something inside him broke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis next breath was shuddering, and the breath after that even more so, and then there were tears streaming down his face and then he was holding onto her so tightly, and she was hugging him back with equal ferocity and a part of him wondered if he even deserved this.\n\n\nNeither of them spoke, they just sat there and held each other, and that was enough. Grian wasn\u2019t thinking, he couldn\u2019t, everything that had happened in the past few hours was crashing down around him and this was the straw to break the camel\u2019s back, he could barely see anything from the tears in his eyes (not that there was much to see in the first place), but he felt her arms around him and it felt like coming home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey broke away after a moment, and distantly Grian could hear a ringing in the back of his mind, but he paid no attention to it.\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 so now what? If I\u2019m not\u2026 dead then, why am I here?\u201d Grian croaked, voice raw from the emotions.\n\n\nNetty was quiet for a moment, a thoughtful expression crossing her face.\n\n\n\u201cI think\u2026 the Universe wanted to be kind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian almost laughed, the Universe being kind to him was a bitter thought, the Universe wasn\u2019t kind to him, it had never been. He sighed, the shock of it all was wearing off now and the ringing getting louder.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s it like, on the other side, I mean,\u201d Grian asked, and Netty laughed slightly,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be naughty, Grian, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to tell you that,\u201d she replied cheekily, leaning back on her hands. Grian blinked a few times, trying to get rid of the tears that had filled his eyes at the phrase, cursing himself mentally for getting so worked up over a word. A comfortable silence fell over the two for a moment, but then Grian bit his lip, looking away from the girl in front of him,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m so scared, Netty,\u201d he confessed, his voice quiet, \u201cI\u2026 I killed them, permanently, I killed them.\u201d He shook his head slowly, like the information was surprising to himself, \u201cAnd I\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel bad. I \n\ndon\u2019t \n\nfeel bad.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNetty shook her head as well,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, Grian. You were protecting yourself and your friends, they didn\u2019t give you a choice.\u201d She frowned, looking at her friend with a serious look in her eyes, \u201cIf anything Grian you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re brave, you\u2019re so brave. You\u2019re brave for standing up for yourself and in a very, very stupid way, you were brave for being willing to sacrifice yourself for them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe paused for a moment,\n\n\n\u201cThat was a stupid thing you did though, I hope you know that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian laughed, his body relaxing slightly. He frowned after a moment, however, the ringing loud enough now that it was irritating,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d\n\n\nNetty shook her head, tilting her head at her friend, \u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\nGrian hummed, trying to block it out. He leaned forward slightly, wrapping his arms around his legs and putting his chin on his knees,\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want to leave you here.\u201d He admitted, mumbling into his jeans. Netty smiled apologetically at him,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a choice with that, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she paused for a moment, \u201cPlus, you have people you need to get back to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe nodded quietly; she was right. It\u2026 it was time he started focusing on the future instead of the past. Time for him to move on. He laughed a little as a thought came to him,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m a little surprised Taurtis isn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\n\nNetty look at him confused, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\nGrian laughed a little awkwardly, rubbing the back of his head, \u201cOh well, I mean I was closest to him out of everyone, so I guess\u2026 I thought that might\u2019ve made more sense.\u201d\n\n\nThe ringing was getting almost overwhelming now, and Netty still looked confused.\n\n\n\u201cNo Grian, I mean why would Taurtis be here at all?\u201d\n\n\nNow Grian was confused, he put his hands over his ears instinctively at the ringing, but it did nothing, and he could feel himself getting\u2026 dizzy.\n\n\n\u201cWh... what do you mean\u2026\u201d he slurred, trying to keep himself upright.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGrian\u2026 Taurtis isn\u2019t with us, on the other side.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd for the second time, Grian\u2019s world went black.\n\n\u00a0\n2 Months Later\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGrian flew through Hermitville, moving his way through the insanity that had become of it due to the build off. Ren had just joined the competition it seemed, his van now flying high above the ground directly in front of Grian\u2019s house (He needed to think of something to counter that, now that he thought about it\u2026). Grian smiled to himself as he landed in front of his house, craning his neck up to look at it stretch up high above him, he\u2019d almost been disqualified a little while ago, Mumbo throwing a fit when he\u2019d seen Grian using his wings to build instead of an actual elytra, which in his words, \u201cwas cheating.\u201d Grian counted that with the fact that he couldn\u2019t exactly\u2026 use an elytra anymore, without his wings getting in the way, which shut Mumbo up fairly quickly. He chuckled to himself at the memory, walking through his front door and tucking his wings tight behind him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe paid no mind to the number of chests and shulker boxes that surrounded the room, telling himself he\u2019d get to them later, and made a b-line towards a small hole in the floor. He grabbed ahold of the ladder leading down, being sure to not hit his wings on the cramped area. He reached the bottom, turning to look at the room in front of him. His old magic room, practice room, whatever he had called it, had been renovated. Soft grass now replaced the harsh stone ground, the walls and ceiling had been replaced with glass that looked out into the surrounding water. Torches stood on fence posts along a small pathway, lighting the room up, and at the end of the pathway\u2026 a face, Taurtis\u2019 face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe other hermits had been, understandably, confused when they\u2019d seen the room for the first time. But Grian had assured them it was nothing to be worried about, that he knew what he was doing and that they just had to trust him, which was enough to calm their nerves. Grian walked up to the shrine lightly, the room was almost soundproof, being so far underground, and that along with the dim lighting, gave the room a very calming atmosphere. Sometimes he\u2019d come down here just to get away from everything.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe opened his inventory, grabbing the rose from it and holding it in his hand carefully. He\u2019d built the room as soon as he had recovered enough to do so, he had wanted to as soon as he\u2019d woken up back in Hermitcraft, but the others had near about tied him to the bed until he was well enough to walk on his own again. Which, thinking back on it now, was understandable.\n\n\nGrian took a breath, kneeling into the dirt and planting the flower, making sure that it was in the ground properly before letting go and standing back up. The room was covered in flowers of every kind, and it looked very beautiful, more so than it had back in Evo. To Grian however\u2026\n\n\nDespite the room\u2019s beauty, it still made his stomach churn. It had only taken a few days for Taurtis to show up at the summoning platform last time, here, however, almost two months had passed and\u2026 nothing. He planted a flower every day, and he was almost worried about running out of room, still, he kept his hopes up, he had to. He knew he was probably grasping at straws, but this was the only idea he had, he had no idea where Taurtis could be, let alone if he\u2026 was actually alive. Netty had said they he wasn\u2019t with them but\u2026\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe signed, he always got lost in his head when he thought about it. He shook his head, drawing himself back into the present. Looking up at the face, he smiled softly, even if this didn\u2019t work\u2026 he would be ok, he had his friends by his side, and though the sting when he thought about Evo would never fully go away\u2026 he could handle it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe turned to walk back to the ladder--\n\n\u00a0\n\n--and heard muffled sound from under the ground.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian stopped in his tracks, not even breathing as he tried to listen for another noise.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 Hello...?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian whipped around, crashing to the ground and digging at the dirt where he\u2019d just planted the flower. His mind was going at a million miles an hour, and his hands were shaking as he dug, dirt getting under his fingernails in his haste, but he didn\u2019t care,\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then the block broke,\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd,\n\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh! Grian!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaurtis looked up at him from under the ground, a pleasantly surprised smile on his face, but then his smile fell, and an annoyed look took its place,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAw man, did I sleep through the Update again?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaurtis grabbed at the edge of the hole, lifting himself up through it as Grian sat back in shock. Taurtis sat on the edge of the hole, his feet dangling into it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDude I swear I was going to come with the group, but I guess I just slept in again? I need to stop doing that, maybe I need to build an alarm clock or something, anyway, I like, woke up in that upside-down-- no what did we call it before? Downside up or something-- and I tried to get to the Update portal, but it was in the Nether and none of the portals there would work! Which was really annoying! But I was still tired, so I went back to sleep and\u2026 and you\u2019re crying\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaurtis trailed off, noticing Grian\u2019s face. He was crying, looking at his friend with wide, almost unbelieving eyes. Neither of them said anything for a moment, Taurtis\u2019 expression growing concerned.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\u2026 are you alright?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrian laughed, and then he laughed harder, and then he leaned over the hole and grabbed Taurtis, pulling him towards him into a hug, still laughing. Taurtis, despite his confusion, laughed with him, hugging his friend back as hard as he could.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a moment Grian\u2019s laughed trickled to a stop, and he sniffled, rubbing the tears out of his eyes,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m alright,\u201d he choked out, still chuckling quietly, \u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019m going to be alright.\u201d\n\n\nAnd as Grian held his friend, he had a thought, that maybe, just this once,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Universe was going to be kind.\n"
