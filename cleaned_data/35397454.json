    "text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dinner was incredible as always. Fish caught earlier that day served with garlic rice, potatoes, rolls, and saut\u00e9ed vegetables all topped with a tangy glaze. The texture of each side dish complimented the main course, each presenting a slightly different note in the same melody. In all honesty, Usopp, who largely fed himself off of what he could decipher from his mother\u2019s cookbook, probably wasn\u2019t actually cultured enough to truly understand just how good it was.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe meal is awesome, Sanji,\u201d Usopp complimented, piling his plate high with seconds before Luffy could take it all for himself. He might not have enough culture to understand, but he could still appreciate and show it. He tried his best to compliment Sanji for every meal they had, especially since Whole Cake. He refused as a matter of pride to take the cook and all his prowess for granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Around the table were noises of agreement, hums around food and a, \u201cSUPER delicious!\u201d from Franky, pose and all. Sanji preened at the attention, finally sitting down with them after the matters of his kitchen were attended to for the moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s to everyone\u2019s liking,\u201d he said, a small and sincere smile on his face. Usopp admired how Sanji could be proud of his work yet still humble when he received compliments. Usopp himself still had no idea how to balance that sort of thing, all too often letting things go to his head until he was swiftly reminded of the reality of limitations he lived in. He should really be taking notes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From next to him, Usopp noticed Zoro looking up from his plate. He caught Sanji\u2019s attention, making direct eye contact. Usopp braced himself. Direct eye contact was how wild predators started fights, and when it came to those two it was exactly the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFood\u2019s good, cook,\u201d Zoro said lowly. It was rare for Zoro to use actual words to compliment anyone, especially Sanji. Usually, he used undecipherable grunts to communicate, especially at meals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of preening at Zoro\u2019s compliment, as he had the others, Sanji rolled his eyes and gave him some kind of look.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp really didn\u2019t understand. From the surface level, it looked like Zoro paying Sanji a rare word of appreciation. According to both their body language, though, it was like Zoro had tried something and Sanji was exasperated about it. Zoro smiled smugly back.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChew with your mouth closed, you cave man!\u201d Sanji said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure,\u201d Zoro said around his food, clearly not doing as told.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was a predicable exchange, one Usopp could set his watch by, but he has never truly understood the actual logic of how communications between them worked. How did they pick what to fight about? How did Sanji read Zoro\u2019s flat tone? How did Zoro manage to find the exact worse time to do something? It\u2019s like they were flawlessly synchronized but chose to clash perfectly rather than harmonize. Even after all this time, those two were a complete mystery to him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Zoro returned to his meal, the movement of his head made his earrings ring together, drawing Usopp\u2019s attention despite him being plenty used to the sound. Three long, thin tear drops in gold pierced in succession up one ear. There was also a simple gold cuff sat high in the cartilage of the same ear. Zoro had always had the three dangling piercings as long as Usopp had known him, but the cuff was newer, though Usopp couldn\u2019t exactly place when he got it. It wasn\u2019t like he kept track of everyone\u2019s personal body jewelry choices. He wondered if either of them meant something in particular. Zoro could sometimes surprise you with how deep something seemingly innocuous ran. And, unlike whatever Zoro and Sanji\u2019s little rivalry was about, he could actually relatively harmlessly ask about it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, he did.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, Zoro, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked before \u2013 do your earrings mean anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro turned to him with a raised eyebrow, the motion making his earrings chime again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been sailing together for how long and you haven\u2019t ever thought to ask before?\u201d Nami said from across the table.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you ever asked?\u201d he countered, eyes narrowing at Nami.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nami pouted at him and crossed her arms. That was a no, then. Usopp stuck his tongue out in victory, because he was a man and that was an appropriate, adult response.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro rolled his eyes and turned back to his food, shrugging. \u201cNo real meaning to \u2018em,\u201d he said around a mouthful of fish, quickly slapping a stretchy arm away out of pure instinct, \u201cJust exactly what you see: three swords. Thought it looked cool.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh,\u201d Usopp said, shrugging as well. He deflected the hand that went for his food after failing to get Zoro\u2019s. He kind of figured that was all, but theoretically there could have been a cool story there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d Nami asked, apparently interested. She gestured with her hand to her own ear, pointing to the shell of it right where Zoro wore the gold cuff.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro reached up, absentmindedly rubbing at the piercing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a moment, he didn\u2019t say anything. He only looked up at Sanji seated directly across from him. Usopp watched as they shared some sort of telepathic conversation. That happened sometimes. He imagined little lines of electricity connecting the two, crackling as they battled for mental dominance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanji lifted a brow, Zoro\u2019s face remained exactly where it was, completely expressionless. Sanji narrowed his eyes in a glare, Zoro remained exactly the same. Sanji rolled his eyes, Zoro remained exactly the same. Sanji let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cFine, fine, just stop with the puppy-dog eyes,\u201d he finally said, waving off the matter with a hand and returning to his meal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp blinked at the two. That was\u2026 unexpected. Not only did it not make any sense for Zoro to look to Sanji about answering a personal question, but Sanji seemed to have just given some sort of permission? And not offered to separate Zoro\u2019s head from his body? Not to even mention that Zoro\u2019s face looked absolutely nothing like a puppy\u2019s, so where Sanji was getting that Usopp had no clue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro also returned to his meal as if that odd happenstance had never even occurred.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A moment passed. Usopp\u2019s leg started bouncing, curious. Zoro said absolutely nothing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Well?\u201d An almost impatient voice said, sounding from further down the table. It was Brook, who apparently had tuned in to their conversation as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, what?\u201d Zoro asked, eyeing him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat does your fourth earring represent?\u201d He asked. \u201cAll your quiet has made my heart pound in anticipation, though, I suppose I don\u2019t actually have a heart, yohohoho!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d Zoro said, as if realizing that the rest of them could not, in fact, read minds, and therefore did not, in fact, understand his aside to Sanji. Which, by the way, was still weird.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, Zoro just shrugged again, grabbing a fork full of rice. \u201cWedding band.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh,\u201d Usopp said mildly, \u201cYou think wedding rings are the most common type of jewelry out there? Since even people who wouldn\u2019t ever think of wearing necklaces or bracelets would still wear one? Then again, maybe there\u2019re enough people who like jewelry but won\u2019t do the whole marriage thing to balance it out. I mean, you don\u2019t look like the type for either, but here you are with three earrings and a\u2026\u201d Wait. \u201cWedding\u2026\u201d Hold on just a second. \u201cBand\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp stopped his runaway mouth, words finally turning into concepts and ideas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wedding band? Marriage? Zoro!?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp whipped his head around to stare at Zoro so fast that he heard something in his neck crack. He\u2019d care about that later, though. This took precedence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone but Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro had followed suit, stopping their meal and staring at their stoic, unyielding swordsman who had, to Usopp\u2019s knowledge, never looked at another human being with anything nicer than neutrality before in his life, let alone romantic interest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWh-what the hell do you mean wedding band!?\u201d Nami yelled, breaking the silence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro looked up from his dish mildly and shrugged \u2013 shrugged, at a time like this! \u2013 and said around a mouthful of food, \u201cCan\u2019t really do rings, it\u2019d just get all beat up. And a necklace just hanging there would be used to choke me. So, you know. Earring,\u201d he flicked the little cuff harmlessly, \u201cIt works.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI guess I can see the sense in that\u2026\u201d Chopper said, nodding to himself, yet still seeming shell shocked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cScrew the logistics!\u201d Usopp said, standing suddenly, unable to take all of Zoro\u2019s dodging. Or is it teasing? There\u2019s no way this is real, is it? He\u2019s just pulling their leg, right? \u201cHaving a wedding ring means that you\u2019re married!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp tried to imagine Zoro in some picturesque cottage out by the sea. He\u2019d herd goats or something. His loving spouse would cook and together they\u2019d care for their four children, living happily.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro would literally hate that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYup,\u201d Zoro said simply, as if that was any kind of a reasonable response. A small little smile grew on his face, looking actually rather pleased with himself. Like he wasn\u2019t just married \u2013 as if that was even a possibility \u2013 but happy to be, too.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp felt like tearing his fucking hair out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Zo-bro,\u201d Franky said, butting in, \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously be saying that, at some point, you found someone you wanted to marry. Like, together forever marry? And then actually did it? Without inviting any of us?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro scoffed, \u201cDon\u2019t see how my romantic relationship is anyone else\u2019s business. And I\u2019m telling you now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp\u2019s head was reeling. Has he ever heard Zoro even say the words \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201crelationship\u201d before? Zoro was a man of steel and harshness. Sure, Usopp knew very well by now that there was a special little soft spot in him that he only showed to a select few, to his nakama, and even then, only so very often, but this was a whole other league. Zoro has a secret relationship that is so important to him that he got married and now wears his ring everywhere he goes? And now he\u2019s talking about it openly like it\u2019s no big deal?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBu-but\u2026 When!?\u201d Nami cried, seeming just as flabbergasted as Usopp. He\u2019s glad he isn\u2019t alone here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLittle after Wano. Some spring island,\u201d Zoro answered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was a stupid answer, though, because Wano was well over a year ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t even remember the name of the island?\u201d Sanji snorted, acting far too casual considering the impossible thing happening.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was busy,\u201d Zoro replied in a deadpan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sanji said, a mocking smile playing on his lips.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp didn\u2019t know if it was best to be mocking Zoro about this. If it happened. Which it probably didn\u2019t. He was actually fairly convinced this was all a fever dream, to be honest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Minello Isles?\u201d Nami asked with a far-off look, brow furrowing. Leave it to their navigator to figure out which island Zoro could possibly mean. Usopp tried to think back, finding it difficult. They just came across so many little islands \u2013 not to mention not-islands like floating cities and traveling groves of vegetation \u2013 between their larger adventures and this one had been, reportedly, over a year ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe ones with the hot springs?\u201d Chopper chimed in. A memory clicked in place, then, of a cluster of spring islands in full bloom. They were littered with natural hot springs and all the tourist attractions they came with. The log pose had taken two weeks to set, so they had an unusually long amount of time to enjoy their stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp mostly remembered spending time with Franky investigating some of the unique properties of the mineral deposits brought up by the springs. He also did his fair share of bathing and relaxing with everyone else, too.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp tried to place Zoro there, on one of the idyllic islands. Showered and clean, his usually unruly green hair combed back and smoothed, dressed in a black tux with a bow tie. A red carnation poked out of his pocket. He stood at the top of one of the blooming hills, forcing himself to be patient yet clearly eager, as he nervously waited at an alter for his dearly beloved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was an actual impossibility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a beautiful venue,\u201d Robin said, sounding uncharacteristically dreamy. Oh god, was the weirdness spreading?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThough it would be unfortunate if you were to fall into some of the less hospitable pools,\u201d a smile coming to her face, \u201cI understand their acid is\u2026 quite corrosive.\u201d Usopp sent a prayer of thanks to literally anything listening. She was normal. Creepy, but normal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Franky suddenly broke out in tears. \u201cZo-bro,\u201d he cried, blowing his nose into a handkerchief (Usopp\u2019s pretty sure he only programmed himself with tears and snot for the effect rather than true medical necessity), \u201cThat\u2019s so super of you to commit to someone like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you even know how to talk long enough to say proper vows?\u201d Nami asked. The words themselves sounded like an insult, but one look at how she tugged at her hair revealed that she was closer to incredibly anxious on Zoro\u2019s behalf.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro scoffed at her, offended nonetheless, \u201cI managed.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanji snickered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp couldn\u2019t even conceive of what vows Zoro would say.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA point of order, if I may,\u201d Brook said, raising a boney hand and addressing Zoro directly, \u201cWas this an actual wedding? That is to say, was there some sort of minister there to perform the ceremony, or any witnesses? Not that it truly matters, of course, as we are pirates who have no need for rules such as those.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, now someone was talking. Maybe Zoro was just fucking stupid. Maybe he thought if he liked someone and put an earring on and then literally told absolutely no one about it, they\u2019d be as good as married. He has a funny working brain like that, it was actually not unprobeable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLuffy did it,\u201d Zoro said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLUFFY!?\u201d The table yelled, now swiftly changing focus to their captain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luffy sat at the head of the table, rubbing his full belly. Usopp looked down at his own forgotten plate. It was empty. Typical.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh?\u201d Luffy asked, aware now of the sudden attention since his feeding frenzy was finally over.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou officiated Zoro\u2019s wedding!?\u201d Nami demanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp sighed and rubbed his face. If Luffy really did officiate, then, as a ship\u2019s captain, he would be capable of legally binding them. But it sounds like the affair doesn\u2019t ring a bell. He could strangle Luffy, honestly. How do you wind up with a guy you really can\u2019t be sure would remember officiating his first mate\u2019s wedding?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe bribed you with porkchops,\u201d Zoro reminded helpfully.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of \u201cwe\u201d sent an odd tingle up Usopp\u2019s spine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luffy\u2019s eyes glazed over, surely trying to parse one porkchop from another. A line of drool dropped down his chin even though he\u2019d literally just eaten, the damn glutton. \u201cOh yeah!\u201d he finally cried, breaking out in a wide smile, \u201cThose were really good! Sanji, make those again sometime!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanji returned the demand with a smile, always happy to hear requests of past dishes. \u201cSure,\u201d he answered, looking like he was taking stock of their supplies in his head, \u201cNext time we stock up I\u2019ll get the right meat for it. Though, I have to admit, the pork on that island was exceptional. Maybe it had something to do with the hot springs?\u201d Sanji discussed the matter so nonchalantly, as if food was in any way an important topic in this batshit conversation they were having. He supposed that for Luffy and Sanji food was always an important topic, but still.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp revised his image of the alter. Now a Luffy in a suit stood before a podium (even in his imagination, Usopp couldn\u2019t muster up a tie for him). Sanji, in a pressed suit even nicer than Zoro\u2019s \u2013 not even actually trying to upstage Zoro for once, just happening to by merely being how he is \u2013 was off to the side, holding a platter of pork chops for their captain to eat off of as they waited for the final guest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, wait, wait, wait, wait,\u201d Usopp said, a realization suddenly hitting him, \u201cYou cooked the bribes for Luffy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, duh.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo, you knew about Zoro getting married!?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the third time that meal the table went dead silent, everyone staring at their crewmate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanji \u2013 the absolute rat bastard \u2013 had the nerve to shrug.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course he did!\u201d Luffy said, all grins and laughing, \u201cHe was there, after all!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, that sure didn\u2019t compute. It made absolutely no sense. Why, out of anyone on the crew, would Zoro let Sanji \u2013 and only Sanji \u2013 be present for his goddamn elopement? And then Sanji had said absolutely nothing about it? There was no teasing at all? There was no way in this lifetime that he could have ammunition as fucking good as Zoro getting on one knee and not bring it into literally every argument they have ever had since.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where had Sanji been on that island if not spreading whatever happened at that wedding? There was no way there wasn\u2019t massive dirt there of either Zoro being completely stone faced the whole time or being somehow pathetically romantic (Usopp wanted to puke at the concept). Sanji should\u2019ve been singing about the whole affair for weeks. Now that Usopp thought about it, he hadn\u2019t really seen Sanji those two weeks, though. Then again, each of the little islands that made up the area had slightly different foods \u2013 some coordinated tourist thing to encourage people to explore the whole area instead of just the most popular stops \u2013 so he\u2019d just written it off as Sanji exploring the cuisine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Had Sanji, what, isolated himself for those two weeks? Because he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to help but to spill the beans? But why would he care about Zoro\u2019s secrecy though? They fought like cats and dogs! Sanji\u2019s job on deck was first as cook and second as personally-appointed-Zoro-annoyer, (not that Zoro didn\u2019t deserve it; he once watched Zoro walk over to where Sanji was sitting down for once in his life, mumble like three words to the guy, and Sanji\u2019s face immediately flew into such a bright redness that he literally \u2013 and Usopp does really mean literally \u2013 caught on fire. Sanji had dragged them off to an entirely different part of the ship to have what was almost certainly a fucking hell of a battle.) so why would Sanji ever keep a secret like this?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLuffy!\u201d Nami scolded, breaking Usopp out of his thoughts and bringing him back to the conversation, \u201cDo you even understand how serious marriage is!?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure I do,\u201d Luffy shrugged, picking his nose because he was a literal five-year-old. \u201cThey said they\u2019d take care of each other and now they\u2019re doing just that. For like, forever.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for the nose picking and the matter-of-fact tone, Usopp would almost think that was sweet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWow,\u201d Chopper said, little stars in his eyes, \u201cSo human marriage is about taking care of each other forever?\u201d It was actually sweet to see the little reindeer starstruck at the concept. Usopp guessed that as a doctor, caring for other people meant an awful lot to him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s so SUPER beautiful,\u201d Franky cried, at this point creating a puddle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s why I keep saying no to Hancock,\u201d Luffy explains, still far too laid back for this conversation, \u201cShe keeps trying to marry me, but I don\u2019t have time to take care of some lady for forever. That\u2019s just way too long!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, the beautiful Boa Hancock,\u201d Sanji predictably swooned, hearts in his eyes, \u201cIf only she\u2019d asked me to marry her; I would be at her lovely beck and call at this very moment.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp rolled his eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around again sometime,\u201d Robin said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her then?\u201d Her question was oddly sharp, like a pin looking to spear a butterfly\u2019s wing to cork.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re so incredibly bright as always, Robin,\u201d Sanji purred, because he was an idiot, \u201cAnd so kind to look out for my dreams like that.\u201d Usopp\u2019s not sure exactly what that question was aimed at, but he\u2019s pretty sure that wasn\u2019t it. \u201cAlas,\u201d he cried, dramatically leaning back, his wrist resting on his forehead limply like some sort of damsel, \u201cMy hand is already spoken for.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp blinked at him. What? Something here wasn\u2019t processing. What the hell did that mean? Already spoken for?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSanji\u2026\u201d Nami said, sounding unsure and upset, \u201c\u2026You\u2019re not talking about Pudding, are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanji\u2019s dramatically anguished face curdled like spoiled milk. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d he said. Relief washed through Usopp almost before concern had. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he continued, recovering, \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful, kind, clever, sweet girl and all, but she\u2019s literally 16. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t really feel that way about someone that much younger than me. And I knew her for like a week. A very stressful week. During which she tried to kill me. Which, I have forgiven her for, but still.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a collective sigh of relief around the table. Everyone had kind of had their one-on-one time with Sanji about the whole incident, and it seemed so far in the past now, but some wounds run deep. Such clear denial was good to hear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen, Sanji-san,\u201d Brook said, \u201cIf my ears did not deceive me \u2013 not that I have any, mind you, yohohoho! \u2013 then I would be led to believe that someone else has laid claim to your heart?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, yeah!\u201d Usopp yelled, pointing an accusatory finger, \u201cWho the hell else would you get married to?\u201d And since when were they talking about Sanji getting married to someone? Wasn\u2019t this supposed to be an investigation into Zoro\u2019s marriage? How many people on this ship are getting married behind everyone\u2019s backs!?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUgh, a complete brute,\u201d Sanji answered, now leaning his head in one hand, arm resting on the table, \u201cLiterally the opposite of those gorgeous ladies. No soft skin, no delicate hands, no supple curves, no luscious long hair. Pretty much a brick wall in both body and mind.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp blinked at him yet again. What the fuck did literally any of that mean? He can\u2019t comprehend the words, let alone the associated tone. Sanji was supposed to be talking about his spouse (Fianc\u00e9? is he saying he\u2019s already married or just promised? What the fuck?) but he wasn\u2019t doing any of his normal twirling. Hell, it sounded a lot like he was complaining, which was so not mister romance extraordinaire like he normally is about love and beauty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Usopp tried to find anything usable in what Sanji said, a shiver suddenly ran down his spine. He turned to Zoro to see him glaring at Sanji hard from across the table. Usopp shied away, knowing the start of one of their fights when he sees it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, if you didn\u2019t want to, you could\u2019ve just told me no,\u201d Zoro said gruffly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHm,\u201d Sanji said, tilting his head in his hand and making a face like he was actually thinking about it, \u201cShould I have?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro\u2019s glare intensified. \u201cI don\u2019t know, cook,\u201d the title is said with shrapnel sticking out of each letter and Usopp could feel a spring somewhere being coiled dangerously tight, \u201cShould you have?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHm,\u201d Sanji said again, looking Zoro up and down, examining him. He must be trying to guess what move Zoro will attack him with. Not that Usopp really understood why this is starting a fight between the two, but that\u2019s like half of their fights for him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suddenly, though, Sanji\u2019s face did something completely insane. It softened into his supporting hand, basically melting into it. His lips became a soft, involuntary smile. His eyes, though, are the biggest change. They fill with a kind of gentle softness Usopp has only ever seen very few times in his life. He\u2019s seen it in his mother\u2019s eyes when she laughed at one of his lies, in Kaya\u2019s when she waved them off, in Ace\u2019s when he bid his little brother farewell. Sanji\u2019s eyes were full of fondness and love. And they were looking directly at Zoro as if they were the only two in the room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNah, I guess not.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro blew a bit of air out of his nose in way of a laugh and suddenly his entire miasma of doom dissipated. The spring that was coiled so tightly became a silk ribbon, falling away like nothing. He looked away, towards the table, as if holding Sanji\u2019s soft gaze was simply too much for him. A small smile slipped across his face and Usopp saw his dimples for the first time in what felt like years. His face was dusted pink.\n\u201cGood,\u201d is all he said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s it, Usopp decided, this literally cannot be real. Brook\u2019s mouth was on the floor, Robin looked smug, Chopper was whipping his head between Sanji and Zoro trying to figure out what was happening, Nami looked completely shell shocked, Franky had his glasses lifted as he stared in astonishment at the two, and Luffy had fallen asleep at the table. The only logical conclusion he could possibly arrive at is that he tripped, hit his head, and was dreaming all of this in a coma.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only other logical conclusion, if he followed all the clues, read all the signs, was in-fact not logical in the least. If he wasn\u2019t insane or dreaming, then\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCook-bro\u2026\u201d Franky said, unusually careful, \u201cDid you\u2026 marry Zo-bro?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Silence hung in the air for a heartbeat, then another.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then Sanji, without breaking his gaze, dug a thumb under his shirt collar and pulled out a gold chain. Usopp had seen that chain before shining out when Sanji undid a couple buttons on his collared shirts or appearing under the loose collar of the too-big t-shirts he often wears to bed. He\u2019d never thought to ask about it before, nor considered that there might be something at the end of the chain. Yet, as Sanji pulled it from his shirt, it was clear he maybe should have.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYup,\u201d he said, popping the \u201cp\u201d, and smiled wide like a complete dopey loser.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sitting there on the chain, held up by Sanji\u2019s hand, was a classic, simple gold ring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A wedding band.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro\u2019s blush deepened, reaching the tip of his ears, and kissing his own wedding band.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Usopp hoped someone outside of his coma was watering his plants.\n\u201cOkay, you two are going to spill every detail!\u201d Nami demanded, fuming over her pudding.\nSanji had by now cleared away the dinner plates and was bringing out dessert. Usopp didn\u2019t always indulge, but this time he wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he got some explanations.\n\u201cAnything you desire, Nami-swan,\u201d Sanji sang, setting in front of her a bowl of yellow pudding piled high with whipped cream, fruit, wafers, and other elaborate toppings. Usopp would think it was an apology if it weren\u2019t for the fact that this was typical of any given Tuesday for the girls.\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Nami asked with a huff. She dug a spoon into the treat angrily. Usopp saw her eyes light up at the taste and a smile come to her face. She then must have remembered that she was mad, though, because she next stuck her nose up, humphing at the dish. The effect was significantly diminished when she took a second a scoop.\nSanji presented Robin with a slightly smaller but no less elaborate bowl and a cup of decaf coffee. \u201cThank you, dear cook,\u201d Robin said, stirring her coffee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be able to serve you, Robin-chwan!\u201d Sanji cried, completely noodling out. The normalcy of it was somehow unnerving to Usopp.\n\u201cSanji, if I may be so bold,\u201d Brook began, breaking the man out of his heart-filled trance, \u201cIs that truly appropriate? When your paramour is right there?\u201d\nBefore Sanji could answer him, Zoro snorted. He sat back languidly in his chair, crossing one leg over his knee and tossing an arm to rest on the chair\u2019s back. \u201cWhy the hell should I care about the idiot fawning over women?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Usopp said, staring at him, \u201cBecause of the whole\u2026 married thing?\u201d Thinking about it, Usopp hadn\u2019t noted any sort of downplay in Sanji\u2019s reactions to women; he still threw himself at the feet of strangers in every town they visited. He also certainly hadn\u2019t changed his opinion of men, as he was currently setting down much smaller and less decked-out desserts in front of all the male crew members.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Usopp said, speaking a sudden idea out load because he didn\u2019t know how to keep his thoughts on the inside of his head like smart people do, \u201cUnless it\u2019s a marriage of convenience. You know, for tax fraud, or just to change Sanji\u2019s last name.\u201d\nThat kind of thing happened all the time. It\u2019d make sense, then, why they wouldn\u2019t bring it up \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t real, then why say anything? That didn\u2019t really match up with Sanji\u2019s look of complete infatuation earlier, but Usopp was still trying to convince himself that wasn\u2019t a hallucination. Or maybe Sanji\u2019s more into Zoro than Zoro\u2019s into him?\n\u201cHah?\u201d Zoro asked, sounding indignant. Suddenly, the whole room became twenty degrees colder. The swordsman looked down at him, chin raised, a dark shadow cast over his features leaving his one, steel gray eye to pierce into his soul. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to marry someone and not mean it?\u201d\nOh god. He fucked up. Oh god, oh god, oh god. Usopp shrunk back into his chair, throwing his hands up. \u201cN-n-n-no! Of course not!\u201d he cried, already imagining the pain of getting slashed by three swords, \u201cI-I\u2019m sure your matrimony was full of love and respect,\u201d or would he only use one because of how weak Usopp was? \u201cAnd that you each promised your souls with full sincerity,\u201d Or would he even deign to bloody his swords with him, instead throttling him until his last breath was a distant memory, sending him into darkness forever? \u201cAnd that your unparalleled dedication to one another\u2019s hearts will be sung of for generations to co-\u201c\nSuddenly, he was cut off by a completely unexpected kick to the face, sending him flying out of his chair and crashing into the galley\u2019s wall.\n\u201cStop that,\u201d he heard Sanji\u2019s voice say as he saw stars, \u201cYou\u2019re being embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Usopp replied, dazed.\nOkay, so it probably wasn\u2019t a marriage of convenience. Noted.\nAs Usopp righted himself, feeling his face for all of its components, Zoro continued where he\u2019d left off. \u201cAsking love-cook here not to flirt is like asking him not to cook. That\u2019s just how he decides to treat women, there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. If I minded, I should\u2019ve picked someone else.\u201d\nIt was weird to hear Zoro talk about Sanji like that. The words themselves weren\u2019t terribly filled with emotion, but the ease at which he talked felt oddly intimate. Zoro wasn\u2019t just spouting bullshit about how he thinks Sanji\u2019s brain worked, he was talking like he knew this was how it was. He was so in-tune, so familiar, that there was no doubt in him that he was simply correct.\nKnowing someone like that\u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy, especially with Sanji. He had this uncanny ability to wear his heart on his sleeve and yet keep every detail of himself buried deep. Every glimpse Usopp\u2019s ever gotten into how Sanji worked had always been in times of breakdowns and heavy-hearted conversations, and even those were just snippets of what all was there. To speak of Sanji with such confidence meant that Zoro had to have put a lot of time into being trusted enough to see it all.\nUsopp would be lying if he said it didn\u2019t make him just a little bit jealous \u2013 of Zoro for having that trust, and of Sanji for having someone who could earn it.\nHe picked himself up off the floor, making his way back to his seat. He gave Zoro a sheepish smile, now embarrassed at himself for his earlier suggestion. Every minute that passed seemed to prove just how preposterous that idea had been.\nZoro just gave him his usual blankly grumpy look, but Usopp noted that he still had a bowl of pudding at his place rather than it being stolen by the now-awake Luffy in his momentary absence. He ate it gratefully, relishing the mango-vanilla taste. He definitely wasn\u2019t tearing up even a little.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Zoro said, finishing up his thoughts on the matter, \u201cI\u2019m not the jealous type.\u201d\nAt that, a sudden short laugh came from the kitchen. Sanji was behind the counter holding a bottle of sake he must have pulled from some hidden cabinet or whatever system he had to keep Zoro out of the booze. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest pile of bullshit I\u2019ve ever heard in my life.\u201d\nZoro narrowed his eye in a glare, previously relaxed position turning intimidating with the shift. \u201cName one time,\u201d he challenged.\nSanji rolled his eyes, clearly not intimidated in the least. \u201cLara\u2019s on Big Brag,\u201d he said. Usopp vaguely recalled a bar by that name at the last place they docked.\n\u201cOkay, name two.\u201d\nSanji gave him a look as if to ask if he really wanted to play this game. Zoro gave him a look right back. Sanji sighed, setting down the sake, and started to count on his fingers. \u201cRico\u2019s, San Josanna, the market in Mahalli, Dress Rosa, that guy with the blue shirt, oh, and you can\u2019t forget the mandolin incident,\u201d that one made Zoro blush, and Usopp couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted to know or not, \u201cJessica\u2019s, Oronaco Island, Seychelles, that bar with the overly-pink lighting, Seagull Bay, that guy just asking me for directions in Vulmullen, Robert\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill, Fishman Island-\u201c\nA slam and the sound of a chair scratching across the floor suddenly filled the room, cutting Sanji off. Nami had stood up, hands balled on the table and looking down at her place unseeingly. Usopp pressed back into his chair, willing it to swallow him whole. Nami was terrifying when she was angry, and she looked pissed.\n\u201cFishman Island!?\u201d she exclaimed, turning her head to glare at Sanji over her shoulder. Sanji flinched. \u201cJust how long has this been going on for!?\u201d\nThe mood plummeted from teasing to terrified, the shift vacuuming all the air from the room such that you could hear a pin drop. Sanji was taken aback, Nami\u2019s glare stunning him where he stood. Beside Usopp, Zoro was tense, ready to spring into a fight, but left dry as words were never his weapon of choice.\nThe silence stretched, time warping around the tension to turn seconds into days.\nSuddenly, a small voice cleared its throat, breaking the silence and drawing all eyes to it. It was Chopper, sitting on Zoro\u2019s other side. He flinched from the sudden attention of so many eyes on him, especially Nami\u2019s glare, but he didn\u2019t back down. Usopp was very proud of him for that because that\u2019s what he\u2019d do in his hooves.\n\u201cI think what Nami is trying to get at,\u201d he began gently, \u201cis that clearly, you two have been together for a long time now. And clearly, you make each other happy, and you\u2019re important enough to each other to even get married. Which is wonderful! But, you did it all in secret, when we were all right here. Under our noses, even. We\u2019re your nakama, your family, we care about you and your happiness, so why have you never told us something that\u2019s so very, very important to both of you?\u201d\nThat was the crux of it, wasn\u2019t it? Underneath all the shock, Usopp could feel it too, that bit of indignation. How could they possibly have kept this all a secret? And why? Don\u2019t they trust them? Why did they decide they needed to go behind the crew\u2019s backs about this whole thing? He knows he isn\u2019t owed an in on their relationship or anything, but he really was made to miss something as monumental as two of his best friends getting married. They deserve at least an explanation.\nZoro and Sanji exchanged looks, nervousness clearly written all over Sanji\u2019s face. Zoro gave him a look that was equal parts reassuring and a mirror of his nervousness. Somehow, it was both soft \u2013 which looked bizarre \u2013 and ultimately resolute \u2013 which looked fitting. Sanji\u2019s shoulders lowered minutely. Zoro motioned with his head a bit, as if summoning Sanji to his side. Sanji let out a long breath, running a hand through his hair, before picking up the sake bottle again and making his way over to Zoro.\nThere they go, having conversations in each other\u2019s heads again. Disbelief was becoming harder and harder justify.\n\u201cWe, uh, we do have our reasons,\u201d Sanji said as he crossed the room, \u201cBut I guess it\u2019ll really be up to you guys if those reasons are good enough.\u201d When he reached Zoro, he put a hand on the other\u2019s shoulder as he set the bottle in front of him. Rather than immediately go for the booze, Zoro took hold of the hand on his shoulder. He turned his head and pressed a gentle kiss to Sanji\u2019s knuckles before looking up at him with that same half-nervous half-reassurance as before. Sanji smiled gratefully down at him, looking calmer now.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Nami interrupted, tapping her fingernail on the table. She still hadn\u2019t sat back down, now leaning over the table and fixing the pair with her glare. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting.\u201d\n\u201cWell, um, er, you see-\u201c Sanji stammered, clearly having difficulty, \u201cThe thing is, just, uhm-\u201c Even Usopp, king of stalling, couldn\u2019t watch this. Luckily, just before he was going to look away, a sigh cut Sanji off. It was Zoro.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cYou all know how\u2026 we are.\u201d At this, he rubbed the back of his neck, looking bashful. Honestly, seeing emotion so plainly written on Zoro\u2019s face made Usopp feel better about being long-term lied to already. It was rare for Zoro to bare himself like this; he was really trying here. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 stubborn, and hot headed, and we fight all the time, and we aren\u2019t always great at communication. And, you know, sometimes I can be a little oblivious to how other people feel, and sometimes cook can overthink just a little.\u201d There were a couple puffs of laughter at that as those were understatements of the century, but Zoro continued, still serious, \u201cWe just\u2026 we didn\u2019t know if it would work out between us. It almost didn\u2019t, a couple times.\u201d\nUsopp blinked at that, surprised. It had never occurred to him that they might have had trouble working out. The Zoro and Sanji he was seeing right now looked comfortable and easy next to each other, hands still joined near Zoro\u2019s shoulder. Sure, they bicker constantly, but when push came to shove, Usopp had always known them to fight side-by-side, as equals and as partners. But what they said had been true, too; they were stubborn and prideful and locked themselves up so tight it was near impossible to pry them open. He supposed, theoretically, there could be some problems that arose from that.\n\u201cWe got off to\u2026 a really rocky start,\u201d Sanji continued for Zoro, \u201cWe were just\u2026 scared. Of ourselves and each other. Of falling too hard or too little.\u201d\nEyebrows raised in surprise around the room. Nami\u2019s posture lost some of its rigidity. Those words\u2026 they were so honest. They held none of the dodging that Zoro and Sanji liked to usually do about feelings. It was shocking. It was vulnerable.\nIt must have been very difficult.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, plowing forward, \u201cWith how messy it was, we decided to keep what we did just between us. If things didn\u2019t work out, if they went sour or worse, we couldn\u2019t risk it affecting the rest of the crew. If it was just us\u2026 then it not working out would stay just between us and we agreed to be big boys and figure out a way to still cohabitate.\u201d\nEveryone let that statement breath for a minute. That sounded exactly like those two. Only they could turn secretly dating into some self-sacrificial sacrament. They were both too protective of the crew for their own good. They really were willing to go through heart break \u2013 with someone they would have to see and interact with every single day \u2013 all alone if it was for the good of the crew.\nThose bastards.\n\u201cBut, it did work out!\u201d Luffy said suddenly and brightly, completely steam rolling over the fragile mood. He was smiling wide, looking pleased as punch. Nami sighed, collapsing back into her chair, head falling into folded arms as if suddenly exhausted.\nZoro snorted a short laugh and Sanji chuckled, a small blush coming to his face. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, so soft that it was mostly to himself, \u201cIt did.\u201d Zoro rubbed the spot on Sanji\u2019s finger where his ring would be if not around his neck.\nFranky broke into sobs again.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Nami said, sitting up with a sigh. She still looked upset but had now moved from bristling anger to residual grumpiness. \u201cThen, how did you two get from rocky to\u2026\u201d and here, Usopp would have used the word \u201cgross\u201d, because the amount of goopy, lovey-dovey vibes coming off of them was really just egregious, \u201c\u2026Married.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well\u2026\u201d Sanji said awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. Usopp could understand, this was a very awkward conversation, and a clearly very personal question. That didn\u2019t mean he was able to quell his own curiosity to know, though, so he certainly wouldn\u2019t be stepping in to save them.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Zoro said, finally now reaching forward for the sake, \u201cWe promised we\u2019d tell \u2018em everything.\u201d\nUsopp raised an eyebrow at that, having not heard such a promise, but was not unpleased about it.\nSanji sighed, not moving from his spot behind Zoro, but instead now leaning an elbow on his shoulder, casually using him as furniture. Zoro didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cFine, then you tell them, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\nZoro rolled his eye as he took a sip. \u201cFine, fine,\u201d he acquiesced, \u201cWe decided to start dating at the after party of Fishman Island. From there, stuff happened, and then better stuff happened, and then worse shit happened, and then much better stuff happened, we got married, and now we\u2019re here.\u201d\nEveryone at the table gave Zoro a flat look. This is what happens when you leave it to him to tell a story.\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Robin said from down the table, head tilted in her hand, \u201cI was under the impression your relationship began shortly after Thriller Bark.\u201d\nAll eyes snapped accusingly to the couple, whose faces rapidly reddened in tandem.\n\u201cThat was, I, uhm, well, you see,\u201d Sanji stammered, then abandoned his attempt to take a swig of Zoro\u2019s sake.\n\u201cWe, uh, well, we weren\u2019t,\u201d Zoro coughed awkwardly, \u201cWe weren\u2019t, uh, dating. Yet. Then. At that time.\u201d\nUsopp felt his own face redden. Ah. Messy indeed. That was, coincidentally, exactly as much information about those types of events that he wanted. In fact, it was nearly more.\n\u201cI thought it started in Skypiea?\u201d Luffy said, head tilting to the side like a dog. At this, eyebrows raised. Robin was never wrong about this sort of thing, but Luffy\u2019s intuition was uncannily accurate.\n\u201cSkypiea?\u201d Sanji asked, looking at Zoro with confusion. Zoro did not look back. Instead, he was seized up, bottle halfway to his lips, and burning so red that Usopp swore he could feel the heat all the way from where he was sitting.\nSanji\u2019s face immediately assumed a playfully smug expression. \u201cMosshead?\u201d He prompted, clearly delighted.\nZoro refused to look at him, instead finishing taking his sip, or rather his chug as he downed what must have been at least half the bottle in one go. His face continued to burn.\n\u201cMa-ri-mo,\u201d Sanji sang, now hanging his face upside down in front of Zoro\u2019s. Zoro closed his eye, refusing to look at him. \u201cWe promised to tell everything once they asked, remember? That means everything.\u201d\nZoro set the bottle down, gripping it tight as he grimaced. \u201cTch,\u201d he said, opening his eye to glare at Sanji. Sanji looked truly excited. Zoro sighed in defeat, looking at where he thumbed his bottle\u2019s label rather than anyone else. Somehow, his face burned brighter.\n\u201cSkypiea is just where\u2026 You know there was the bonfires and the parties\u2026 and the firelight with your hair and you were dancing and drinking and had that damn stupid cute smile and\u2026 you just\u2026 that was when I noticed\u2026 you know\u2026 how\u2026 beautiful you are. And stuff.\u201d\nUsopp was going to barf. That was way too sweet.\n\u201cThat is so embarrassing for you,\u201d Sanji said, still hanging in front of Zoro, smile impossibly wide and eyes absolutely shining in mirth.\nUsopp couldn\u2019t help spurting a laugh, trying to stifle it. Nami was clearly struggling herself, and he could hear Chopper giggling too. Luffy and Franky were laughing outright, pretty much falling out of their chairs.\n\u201cHow beautiful,\u201d Brook said, \u201cMay I use that in a song?\u201d\n\u201cNo way in hell!\u201d Zoro snapped, a giggling Sanji still in his face.\nZoro leveled Sanji with a glare, but it held absolutely no heat because he was pouting rather than snarling. Sanji somehow smiled wider. \u201cShut up,\u201d Zoro said, shoving at the other\u2019s smile, \u201cGet your face outta my face, curly brow.\u201d\nSanji let himself be pushed away, still laughing. Usopp didn\u2019t miss the way he caught himself as he leaned back by hugging around Zoro\u2019s shoulders, nor how Zoro made absolutely no complaint about it.\n\u201cSo, what happened after Fishman?\u201d Chopper asked as the table calmed back down.\n\u201cAh, well,\u201d Sanji said, looking calmer than before, \u201cLike algae-brain said. \u2018Stuff\u2019. Mostly, we were just awkward and dumb and didn\u2019t know what we were doing. Eventually, though, we did figure out how to talk to each other \u2013 with words and everything \u2013 and things got better from there. Much better.\u201d\nZoro hummed in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re still dumb, though,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLook who\u2019s talking, stupid,\u201d Sanji answered with a smirk.\nUsopp was struck once more by just how normal that was. The intimacy and the information were weird, but at the core, they were still the same. Always bickering, everything a competition, forever in perfect synch. It just had a new, softer twist to it.\n\u201cIf things were going so well, then why\u2019d you still keep it hidden?\u201d Usopp asked. Messy and rocky he could understand wanting to hide, but if it got anywhere close to right now, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to tell everyone than to keep sneaking around?\n\u201cHm, yeah\u2026\u201d Sanji said, smile suddenly looking sad, somber even. Zoro reached up to the hands still wrapped around his collar, holding them gently, like they were precious. \u201cWe maybe would have \u2013 told everyone, I mean \u2013 sometime around then. But then, I, uh, ran off to Whole Cake.\u201d\nThe table was hushed once again. He\u2019d settled his own feelings about the incident with Sanji a long time ago. In all honesty, after hearing the full story, he really couldn\u2019t be mad at him \u2013 unhappy, yes, but not mad. All Sanji had truly done was be the kind person that he always has been, that everyone loves him for. That said, he remembered how he felt before hearing the full story \u2013 confused, scared, betrayed. How would it feel then, to be Zoro? To have something good with someone, and then they, out of the blue, run off to go marry someone else without a word.\nUsopp remembered how quickly Zoro had stated his rationale for why they shouldn\u2019t go after him. He remembered what he\u2019d said to Nami back then, \u201cFirst of all, how could he get wrapped up in such a thing as marriage? It\u2019s such a small deal!\u201d \u00a0He remembered how Zoro was silent and drunk the whole ride to Wano.\nHe bet it didn\u2019t feel real great.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Sanji said softly after a moment, sounding like he knew what everyone was thinking about. He looked down, avoiding their gazes. Doing that, though, just lead him to Zoro\u2019s, as the other was now looking up at him with an unreadable expression.\nZoro reached up with his free hand, caressing Sanji\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re better now, though,\u201d he said, loud enough for everyone to hear but clearly directed truly at Sanji.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sanji replied, smile turning now grateful as he leaned into Zoro\u2019s touch, \u201cWe are.\u201d\nUsopp was not crying. Franky, Brook, and Chopper were, and Nami\u2019s eyes definitely looked a little wet, and so did Robin\u2019s, but Usopp was definitely for sure not crying. There were just tiny bits of water coming out of his eyes, is all.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sanji said, coughing to break everyone out of the tender moment, \u201cThat and Wano were both very\u2026 intense. And after, once the dust settled, everything kind of moved quickly. Before we even knew it, Zoro was proposing and I was accepting and then the perfect little set of islands came by and we just, well, went and did it. There was never really a good time to let everyone know. What were we supposed to say? \u2018Hey everyone, if you aren\u2019t doing anything else, Zoro and I are going to go get married on a random hill.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou liked the hill,\u201d Zoro reminded him.\nSanji rolled his eyes, \u201cYes, I did like that hill.\u201d\n\u201cI get that it might have been awkward,\u201d Franky said, interrupting their aside, \u201cBut were you guys really just never going to tell us? Not very cool, bros.\u201d\nUsopp frowned. On one hand, it was none of their business. On the other hand, of course it was their business.\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Sanji said, shaking his head, \u201cWe were always going to tell everyone eventually. After the wedding, we promised that if anyone asked about us or our relationship, we\u2019d tell them everything. Or, after two years. Whichever came first.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Usopp asked, \u201cYou really expected one of us to just out-of-the-blue ask you if you were married?\u201d\nSanji shrugged. \u201cHonestly, we expected someone to ask where we were those two weeks.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Nami cut in, \u201cI asked you if you got a chance to try all the food on those islands!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well he did. Crap-cook here dragged me to every. Single. Island. Even the tiny one with only a food stand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that stand had the best fried squid ever,\u201d Sanji defended.\n\u201cYou make better,\u201d Zoro rejected.\n\u201cI make better because I learned what they did first,\u201d Sanji said, but Usopp noticed his ears turning red.\n\u201cOoh, fried squid sounds really good! Sanji, do we have any squid?\u201d Luffy cut in.\n\u201cYou just ate!\u201d Sanji scolded, \u201cAnd no! We don\u2019t! If you want some you have to go catch it yourself.\u201d\n\u201cAwww,\u201d Luffy whined, \u201cNo fair.\u201d\n\u201cWait, how long ago did you guys get married?\u201d Usopp asked, trying to do the math.\n\u201cOne year, three months, and eight days,\u201d Zoro answered.\nEveryone looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cZoro,\u201d Nami asked, \u201cWhat day of the month is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the fuck would I know that?\u201d He responded, raising an eyebrow.\nEveryone stared at him once more, and he stared back.\nSanji shook his head. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how he does it either.\u201d\n\u201cSo this whole time,\u201d Usopp said, just skipping over that, \u201cNone of us have asked you anything that would lead you to tell us you\u2019re married?\u201d\nZoro shrugged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really been subtle.\u201d\n\u201cOh please,\u201d Nami huffed, crossing her arms, \u201cIf this,\u201d she said, gesturing to their clear physical affection, \u201cis how you two normally are then you definitely have been!\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Zoro responded, \u201cI mean, I help with dishes every night and then we just talk on the couch until everyone goes to bed.\u201d\nOkay, well, Zoro does help with the dishes, but Usopp figured that was some peace treaty between him and Sanji about all their constant fighting. He had noticed when he was on watch duty that the galley light is on really late, but he assumed that was just Sanji doing breakfast prep; he didn\u2019t know Zoro hadn\u2019t left yet. \u201c\n\u201cI spend all my smoke breaks in the crows\u2019 nest watching him train.\u201d Sanji chimed in.\n\u201cI thought you went up there to pick fights?\u201d Chopper said.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sanji smiled dreamily, \u201cThat too.\u201d\n\u201cLuffy and Robin definitely already knew,\u201d Zoro pointed out.\n\u201cHuh? Wasn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Luffy asked innocently, the idiot.\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d Robin agreed, which was kind of rude of her because they all knew she was basically a surveillance state in her own right.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Sanji said, \u201cDidn\u2019t Usopp catch us making out, like, a couple weeks ago?\u201d\n\u201cMaking out!?\u201d Usopp said, shocked. He tried to think back to a couple weeks ago. Did he witness something and, due to trauma, block off the memory? Then, a memory surfaced. It was just Zoro and Sanji in the guys\u2019 room, doing normal things. Or, wait, \u201cI thought you two were just literally butting heads!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Zoro said, giving Sanji a smirk, \u201cWe were also doing that.\u201d\nUsopp\u2019s face lit on fire. Franky whistled. Nami covered her ears and Robin covered Choppers. Brook looked overly interested.\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Sanji scolded lightheartedly, booping Zoro on the nose. Zoro shrugged and took another swig of sake, not breaking eye contact. Literally shameless, those two.\n\u201cI do wonder, though,\u201d Robin said, breaking the overly adorable moment between the two, \u201cWhy two years?\u201d\nZoro just shrugged, \u201cNo real reason, just figured that by that point it\u2019d be more awkward for you guys to still not know than to tell you point-blank.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sanji added, \u201cAnd we thought that on our second anniversary, it might be nice to renew our vows, this time in front of more than just Luffy.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Robin asked, sounding genuinely intrigued, \u201cA second wedding?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sanji replied, \u201cOne with suits. And a real venue. And groomsmen and a ring bearer, and all of that.\u201d He was blushing lightly, looking a bit like he wanted to hide behind Zoro but bravely staying in the open. \u201cOne where you guys are actually in attendance,\u201d he continued, \u201cWe do, genuinely, want to share this with you. You\u2019re our family, after all, and we love you.\u201d\nA second wedding? Held just so everyone could attend? Because they\u2019re important to them? A warm feeling bloomed in his chest. Their friends did care, they did matter to them, they just needed a little time to settle themselves out.\n\u201cOh, well, when you say it like that,\u201d Nami said, flicking her wrist and smiling, flowers basically emanating from her.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me happy to hear at all, you bastards,\u201d Chopper protested, dancing.\n\u201cThis wedding\u2019s going to be SUPER!!\u201d Franky announced happily, little confetti cannons on his shoulders going off. Were they new? Maybe Usopp should talk to him about making confetti stars. They could be really fun at parties or for sneak attacks.\n\u201cYeah, well, kind of unavoidable anyway,\u201d Zoro remarked, \u201cCook wants a reception.\u201d\n\u201cIs it so bad to want to cook a wedding feast?\u201d Sanji asked.\n\u201cFeast!?\u201d Luffy asked, \u201cI want a feast!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was bad,\u201d Zoro said, \u201cI just said you wanted it. Like how you wanted to cook after the first one, too. I got the honeymoon suite with a kitchen, didn\u2019t I? Still paying that shit off too.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t complain about it when I didn\u2019t tell you to do that in the first place,\u201d nagged Sanji.\n\u201cSo you would\u2019ve happily gone two weeks without a kitchen?\u201d Zoro asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Sanji spat.\n\u201cHmm, not right now, thanks,\u201d Zoro said, smirking up at Sanji.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, you shitty marimo!\u201d Sanji yelled, face turning a fresh shade of red. He raised his leg in threat, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you!\u201d\n\u201cLike to see you try,\u201d Zoro smiled, hands going to the swords at his hips.\n\u201cCut it out!\u201d Nami yelled, knocking them both on the head, effectively ending their fight before it could begin. It really was just like them to let a petty spat pull them away from such an important discussion like this. Usopp found himself happy, ultimately, that they weren\u2019t really any different now.\n\u201cDamn witch,\u201d Zoro mumbled, rubbing his head as he sat back down.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call Nami that,\u201d Sanji scolded, also rubbing his head. Zoro answered with a tisk.\n\u201cSo, if we ask you questions, will you answer them?\u201d Usopp asked, brimming with things he wanted to know.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sanji answered, turning to him with a small smile, \u201cSince we did still keep everyone in the dark, we promise to answer all of your questions, no matter what they are.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Brook said, \u201cPardon me asking, but, which one of you top-\u201c\nA foot met the left side of Brook\u2019s skull as a scabbarded sword met the right side of his ribs, sending him spinning out of his chair and into the ship\u2019s mast with force. \u201cANYTHING BUT THAT!\u201d The couple roared in unison.\nUsopp was glad. He didn\u2019t want to know. Ever.\nZoro and Sanji dusted themselves off, Zoro returning to his chair and Sanji returning to the kitchen. \u201cAny of you animals \u2013 or my dearest Nami or fairest Robin \u2013 want more dessert?\u201d He called.\n\u201cOoh, me! Me!\u201d Luffy and Chopper replied in unison. The whiplash of going from weird to normal hit, but Usopp did his best to take it in stride. \u201cMe too, please!\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Franky said, \u201cZo-bro was the one to propose?\u201d\n\u201cMhmm,\u201d Sanji hummed, doling out pudding without letting Luffy eat the whole serving bowl, \u201cHe certainly did.\u201d\nZoro groaned, rolling his eye.\n\u201cDid it while lost-,\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lost!\u201d\n\u201c-In a scenic little wood-,\u201c\n\u201cIt was a massive forest!\u201d\n\u201c- and covered in blood.\u201d\n\u201cZoro!\u201d Chopper yelled, never happy to hear a story where someone was hurt.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my blood!\u201d Zoro defended.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that makes it better,\u201d Usopp pointed out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robin said, gaining a sly smile, \u201cbeseeching betrothal bathed in the blood of your loved one\u2019s enemies sounds rather ideal, does it not?\u201d\n\u201cIT DOES NOT!\u201d Usopp, Nami, Chopper, and Brook yelled back.\n\u201cIt was bear blood,\u201d Zoro said, exasperated.\n\u201cWhy the hell were you covered in bear blood?\u201d Nami asked, giving him a bewildered look.\n\u201cBecause there was a bear!\u201d Zoro yelled, throwing his hands up. He then took a deep breath, calming himself down as he raked a hand across his face. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, clearly having had explained these circumstances to exhaustion before, \u201cWe were docked at some island, and I went to town to find some booze. For some reason there was a huge forest between the port and the town-\u201c\n\u201c-There literally was not, the small forest and town were in opposite directions,\u201d Sanji cut in.\n\u201cThe forest was between them!\u201d Zoro insisted, \u201cSo I go through the forest. There\u2019s no trail-\u201c\n\u201cThere was a really well-worn walking trail straight through to the beach,\u201d Sanji said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no trail!\u201d Zoro insisted, \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t figure out which way they put the town because the trees started repeating.\u201d That didn\u2019t even get dignified with a correction. \u201cSomehow, though, I must have wandered into a bear\u2019s territory.\u201d\n\u201cA real bear!?\u201d Chopper cried, as if he couldn\u2019t turn into a skyscraping monster at will.\n\u201cOh yeah, a big black thing with shaggy fur and a scar on his cheek.\u201d Chopper noticeably shivered, and Zoro got an evil grin on his face. \u201cHe had huge paws the size of your head with razor sharp claws. His teeth looked like they could crush bone easy,\u201d he said, having too much fun looming over Chopper. Chopper, in turn, cowered in fear. \u201cHe must have not liked where I was, because out of nowhere lunged at me!\u201d\nZoro suddenly lunged forward himself, scooping Chopper up. \u201cAh! Zoro!\u201d He yelled. After a minute of light roughhousing, Zoro set him back down in his chair.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, though,\u201d Zoro said, all pride, \u201cI didn\u2019t let him get me that easy.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get out!?\u201d Chopper asked, hanging off every word.\n\u201cI sliced it clean down the belly,\u201d Zoro smirked, motioning in a straight line with his hand.\n\u201cSo cool!\u201d Chopper cheered, stars in his eyes.\n\u201cSuper!\u201d Franky yelled, posing.\n\u201cSo, that got you covered in blood?\u201d Nami asked, coming back to the actual point of the story.\n\u201cAh, not really,\u201d Zoro dismissed, \u201cWhat did that was carrying it back.\u201d\n\u201cCarry it back!?\u201d Usopp gasped, \u201cWhy on earth would you bring that thing back with you!?\u201d\n\u201cCook likes trying to make tough meat taste good. Figured he\u2019d like to try bear.\u201d\nEveryone looked to Sanji, who was adding extra whip cream to Chopper\u2019s extra dessert. He just shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s a fun challenge for myself.\u201d\nZoro lugging back a whole dead bear while helplessly lost in the woods just for Sanji\u2019s hobby? They were at port, too, so it wasn\u2019t like they were low on food; necessity was clearly not considered. God, the poor bastard was really in it deep.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re lost in the middle of the woods with a dead bear bleeding profusely,\u201d Robin surmised, \u201cHow does this lead to a proposal?\u201d Somehow, the way she asked made it sound like she was taking notes.\n\u201cWell, after he was gone for a few too many hours, I went to go look for him,\u201d Sanji answered, pudding bowl resting against his hip, \u201cThought about trying the town first, but the forest looked dangerous and foreboding, so I figured he went in there. A path of chopped down trees later, and there I find the plant-man himself, all his green dyed red, with a giant ass bear on his back. So I say, \u2018what the hell are you doing out here? Is that a fucking bear?\u2019 And do you know what he says back to me?\u201d\nZoro shot daggers at him out of his eyes.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luffy asked, clearly on the edge of his seat.\n\u201cHe looks me square in the eyes and says,-\u201c and here Sanji lifted his bangs to imitate Zoro\u2019s hair and dropped his voice an octave, \u201c\u2019Marry me.\u2019\u201d\nLuffy doubled over laughing, and the rest of the table devolved into giggles. Usopp, of course, abstained, definitely successfully holding back his snickering, not even a little bit bursting out into open laughter as Franky hit the table with his huge fist and even Robin chuckled behind her hand.\nZoro\u2019s face was red hot again, this time clearly in anger. A vein was popping out on his forehead, his teeth were bared, and both hands gripped onto his biceps in a way that definitely hurt, as if doing otherwise would only ever end in everyone\u2019s instant slaughter. It probably would. Somehow, that made it funnier.\nSanji laughed, too, bright and bubbly, like it was the funniest thing in his life. He laughed his way over to Zoro, wiping a tear from his eye. \u201cCome on, marimo,\u201d Sanji said, \u201cIt\u2019s very funny, looking back.\u201d\nZoro just growled at him, like an animal. \u201cYou weren\u2019t laughing then.\u201d\nAt that, something in Sanji\u2019s smile softened. No longer manic in laughter, his eyes once again regarded Zoro with impossible fondness. \u201cNo, I suppose I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, sitting down in Zoro\u2019s lap like he belonged there, mostly empty bowl in his own lap.\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d he said, skimming the bowl with a finger and coming up with a glob of pudding, \u201cYou made that the most romantic thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u201d He booped Zoro\u2019s nose, covering it in pudding. \u201cAnd I just couldn\u2019t help but say yes.\u201d\nZoro still glared at him, unmoving for a moment. Eventually, though, without breaking eye contact, he released the grip on one of his arms to swipe at his nose with his thumb. He licked the pudding off, sampling it.\nHe puffed air through his nose.\nUsopp prepared for Sanji to get skewered.\nAnd then Zoro\u2019s face broke out into the stupidest smile Usopp has ever seen in his life, looking just as fond as Sanji did. \u201cStupid cook,\u201d he said, \u201cThat\u2019s way too sweet.\u201d Sanji just smirked back.\nThen, they both started to lean in.\nUsopp coughed.\nInstantly, both their heads snapped to him, eyes shocked, like they were surprised he was there. Sanji shot up out of Zoro\u2019s lap, face red and not looking at anyone as he dusted invisible specs off his apron. Zoro\u2019s face was still red from before, but now it was clearly in embarrassment.\nUsopp felt like the biggest fucking idiot in the world that these two dumbasses managed to keep their shit under wraps for so goddamn long when they let the rest of the world fall away so readily. He blamed it on him always avoiding them when they were together because they were supposed to be fighting.\n\u201cWait, did you even have rings with you when you proposed?\u201d Nami asked. Usopp wondered if she was mentally tallying Zoro\u2019s debt, looking for borrowed money that lied outside of his usual habits.\n\u201cNo, as a matter of fact, he did not,\u201d Sanji answered, a huff in his voice. \u201cI was the one who got a couple rings from town afterwards. I even had the idea for the earring, so mosshead had no room to object about it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t, did I?\u201d Zoro spat. Usopp had the strangest feeling like he probably did, to some degree.\n\u201cWait, then why do you wear yours around your neck, Sanji?\u201d Chopper asked, whip cream smeared around his mouth, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid it could be a choking hazard?\u201d\nZoro picked up his (completely unused, because he was a slob) napkin and wordless held Chopper\u2019s face in his hand and started cleaning off around his mouth.\n\u201cI,\u201d Sanji said with an air of haughtiness, gesturing to his chest, \u201cDo this wild thing civilized people do called, \u2018wearing a shirt regularly\u2019. It includes not getting progressively less dressed the more intense a fight is.\u201d\nZoro rolled his eye, surveying Chopper for spare splatter before releasing him. He mumbled something under his breath about Sanji not always complaining about that, but Usopp chose to not hear it.\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Sanji continued, \u201cA ring on my finger wouldn\u2019t really work out for me, either. Really easy to get bacteria trapped under there and make for an unsanitary workspace.\u201d\nAh, so he wasn\u2019t hiding it. He was just keeping it tucked in to protect it and prevent accidents. That made sense. Usopp saw how the ring now hung outside his shirt, brought to rest around his collar rather than within it. He was almost surprised at the simpleness of both his and Zoro\u2019s rings. He guessed that if they were picked up on just any old island, selection must have been slim. But maybe there\u2019s some poetry in the two having a complicated relationship only for a simple marriage. It was sweet if you thought about it like that.\n\u201cI have been wondering,\u201d Robin said, looking inquisitive, \u201cWhy get married at that group of islands? If I recall, we passed by several others between your engagement and your marriage.\u201d\nUsopp elected to ignore the fact that neither had actually stated which island they\u2019d become engaged on.\n\u201cBlondie here hates the cold,\u201d Zoro answered, \u201cSo at least half of those islands were out for being Winter islands. Other islands we only stopped at for a day or so, which was mostly taken up by cook stocking the ship. This one had good weather, good food, a long stay, and the baths which might make the idiot actually relax for once.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what was in it for you?\u201d Robin asked, eyebrow raised.\nZoro shrugged, \u201cHappy wife, happy life.\u201d\nSanji smacked him in the back of the head so hard his forehead banged on the table and he came bouncing back up again, \u201cDON\u2019T SAY SHIT LIKE THAT!\u201d\n\u201cHEY, THAT REALLY HURT!\u201d Zoro roared, turning in his seat and rubbing his head.\nThese two really do never change.\nThe group talked long into the night, asking questions and getting answers. The wedding had been just the two of them and Luffy \u2013 no suits, no alter, no music or fanfare \u2013 and then they\u2019d run off to some rented apartment on a different island of the archipelago than the rest of them. Once it was time to go, it was just business as usual for them.\nFrom there, certain events were cleared up and new stories were told. Like the time Usopp found them in the galley, Zoro covered in squid ink and Sanji rolling on the floor laughing. Or that time they came back to the ship covered in alpaca fluff. Or that time Sanji sleepwalked into the crow\u2019s nest while Nami was on watch. The more stories that were told, the more everything clicked into place and Usopp had to ask himself again and again how he hadn\u2019t figured it out sooner.\nThe big picture of it all was absolutely crystal clear in Usopp\u2019s eyes: they were hopeless, they were in capital \u201cL\u201d love, and they were happy that way. Usopp, for his part, was happy for them. Two of his best friends, his family, filled with so much love and joy. He couldn\u2019t really hold it against them for keeping this to themselves for a while; they did deserve privacy and space. Plus, they were letting everyone in now, and now is really the time that matters most out here on the Grand Line.\nAs the night wore on, yawns were elicited, growing more frequent as time passed. Finally, Nami stood up, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late to get any more into this,\u201d she decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cWhy of course, Nami dearest!\u201d Sanji extoled, \u201cYour rest and well-being is extremely importa-\u201c\n\u201cBut,\u201d Nami said, cutting him off, \u201cIf I have more questions, will you two answer them later?\u201d She gave both Zoro and Sanji a hard look.\nSanji\u2019s heart eyes softened in something genuine and sincere. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, \u201cWe promise, no more hiding.\u201d\nNami stared him down a minute more, assessing him. Finally, she seemed to come to a conclusion she liked, because she leaned back with a smile. \u201cGood! Oh, and Zoro?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Zoro asked, looking at her with a quirked brow.\n\u201cFor not telling me sooner, all interest rates on your debts are increased by 200%.\u201d\n\u201cTWO HUNDRED!?\u201d Zoro yelled, aghast. Nami just winked and stuck her tongue out. She then simply turned and left the galley, humming happily, leaving Zoro seething in his seat.\nOne by one, everyone rose to follow her lead, emptying out of the galley. Franky was the one to grab Luffy by his collar, dragging his sleeping-like-a-rock form to the barracks. \u201cCongratulations, bros,\u201d he said as he left.\n\u201cYes, congratulations,\u201d Robin said, leaving as well.\n\u201cMy heart would be pounding in excitement for the two of you,\u201d Brook said, \u201cIf I had one!\u201d\n\u201cWe really are happy for you guys,\u201d Usopp assured them, making his leave as well.\n\u201cThanks, Usopp,\u201d Sanji said, sounding sincere. It was nice to be allowed past all those walls every now and then.\n\u201cZoro, Sanji,\u201d Usopp heard Chopper say. He paused in the threshold, wondering what the serious tone from their usually chipper shipmate was about.\n\u201cYes, Chopper?\u201d Sanji asked, sounding a bit concerned, \u201cWhat is it?\n\u201cWere you two really sexually active with one another shortly after Thriller Bark?\u201d\nZoro and Sanji both froze, faces becoming red hot.\n\u201cI- uh- you see,\u201d Zoro stuttered.\n\u201cThe thing is- I mean- medically speaking I guess-\u201c Sanji forced out.\nSuddenly, Chopper grew to his full human height, towering over them. With his giant fists, he bashed them both on the head, sending them crumpling to the floor.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way either of your bodies \u2013 let alone Zoro\u2019s \u2013 were ready for that kind of physical exertion! If either of you pull a single stitch doing something like that, I\u2019ll kill you myself!\u201d\nZoro and Sanji were nothing but two dazed piles on the floor, but they managed to let out a collective groan of, \u201cYes, Chopper.\u201d\n\u201cGood!\u201d Chopper said, giving them one last hard stare. Then, he shrunk back to his hybrid form and walked proudly past Usopp.\n\u201cOh!\u201d he said, just before he crossed the threshold, \u201cAnd congratulations!\u201d He waved cheerily at the two lumps on the ground.\nUsopp suppressed a laugh.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Sanji said, handing Zoro the last plate.\nZoro grunted in response, accepting the plate and drying it.\n\u201cThe others know now,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cWell, that was the plan, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Zoro finished drying his plate, placing it on the stack of identical ones beside him. Sanji opened the right cabinet and Zoro slid the stack into place, as always.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sanji admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, too.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Zoro agreed. Lowering his arms from lifting the plates, he encircled Sanji from behind, the other fitting perfectly in his hold.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you get enough from all that PDA earlier?\u201d Sanji teased, settling against his chest anyway.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Zoro said, nuzzling into the crook of Sanji\u2019s neck, \u201cThat was the most embarrassing thing I think I\u2019ve ever done. We are never doing that again.\u201d\nSanji laughed at him, scratching a hand through green hair, \u201cEven more embarrassing than asking me to marry you?\u201d\n--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are! Holy shit, what happened to you? Is that a bear?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sunlight filtered through the canopy, turning yellow hair golden in the dappled light. A Cigarette sat tantalizingly between soft lips, and his face was gently flushed from the heat of the day. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He reached out a perfect, sacred hand and wiped a trail of blood off his cheek. The hand stayed there, moving his face left and right to inspect him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019d found him. Again. As he always did. No matter how lost he was, Sanji would always come and find him. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro wanted him to do that forever. Knowing Sanji, he would, if only he asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The words left him before he even thought them, his heart speaking instead.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMarry me.\u201d\n\n--\n\u201cWay worse than that,\u201d Zoro answered.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Sanji said, \u201cThen how about picking the island? Saying we should actually follow through?\u201d\n--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trees colored pink and white with blossoms danced along the hills, small pokes of bright green baby leaves complementing them on brown branches. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strong, scarred arms wrap around a waist from behind, holding the other preciously, secretly. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s do it here,\u201d he said, smiling into sun-warmed blonde hair.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d was the soft reply, \u201cLet\u2019s do it here.\u201d\n\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat was easy,\u201d Zoro dismissed, squeezing him tighter.\nSanji laughed in his arms and Zoro relished the sound. \u201cLet go of me,\u201d Sanji smiled, wriggling, \u201cI want to finally go sit down.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zoro sighed but let Sanji escape, only to smile softly when Sanji caught a now free hand in his, dragging him along, too.\n\u201cOh, what about when you started going the wrong way to the hill?\u201d\n--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome on,\u201d a hand in his, calloused but differently, marks earned perfecting the art of creation rather than destruction, \u201cNo getting lost this time.\u201d\n\nA red velvet case sat heavy in his pocket, yet the weight was no burden. It was heavy only from the potential it held inside. The anticipation of entropy made him giddy to his bones.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m never lost,\u201d he retorts, lying through his teeth. He\u2019s always lost these days. Lost in blue eyes, in tender touches, in soft words, in moments where it\u2019s just them and the rest of the world falls away. \n\n--\n\u201cI knew where I was going.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sanji said, falling onto the couch and dragging Zoro with him. Zoro automatically wrapped his arms around the other, sitting back until his head rested on the couch\u2019s armrest and Sanji rested nestled against his chest. He ran a hand up and down Sanji\u2019s back, soothing the muscles of his hard-working cook.\nSanji made a content little noise, stirring butterflies in Zoro\u2019s stomach, which was stupid because they did this nearly every night, yet it seemed it never got old. Sanji reached for his pocket, pulling out his usual cigarette, but Zoro put his hand over his to stop him.\nSanji looked up with a questioning brow. \u201cYou already had six just washing dishes,\u201d Zoro explained, gesturing with his head over to the sink. An ashtray sat beside it, filled with butts and dark ash.\n\u201cOh, did I?\u201d Sanji frowned, putting his pack away.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not the only one embarrassed,\u201d Zoro teased, nuzzling playfully by his ear.\n\u201cOh please\u201d Sanji denied, \u201cSure it was\u2026 certainly something. But it really wasn\u2019t that bad, was it?\u201d\nZoro sighed, continuing his ministrations, \u201cHonestly? It went over better than I thought. Even when Nami looked like she wanted our heads on pikes.\u201d\nSanji shivered in his arms. Their whole arrangement had never been about pulling one over on everyone or anything like that; they just wanted their privacy. Still, Zoro couldn\u2019t fault them for being a little angry with them, and he knew how having either of the girls\u2019 ire directed at him made Sanji feel (in-short, not great).\n\u201cI\u2019ll cook her a feast of treats to apologize!\u201d Sanji declared, determination in his voice. Zoro could see the clockwork in his brain ticking, recipes and decoration ideas already thrumming through his head. He smiled at him fondly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s really mad anymore,\u201d he assured him, remembering her soft smile before she\u2019d slipped out of the galley. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cIf she is, she won\u2019t be much longer.\u201d\nSanji looked up at him, narrowing his eyes in suspicion. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\n\u201cJeez,\u201d Zoro said, giving Sanji and incredulous look, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad, I swear. Give me some credit.\u201d\nSanji didn\u2019t let up on his suspicion, though, and Zoro rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna ask her to be my best man. Maid of honor? I don\u2019t know, whichever, both.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sanji said, blinking at him. Then, he smiled, turning back into Zoro\u2019s chest to hide it. \u201cI think she\u2019ll like that,\u201d he said. Zoro hummed in response.\nA moment of gentle silence passed. Zoro just soaked in the content feeling of holding Sanji close. They got so few moments truly alone. Even now, like this, in the back of their minds they were watching the doorways with haki, waiting for someone searching for a midnight snack or glass of water to wander their way. Though, Zoro supposed that he didn\u2019t have to roll off the couch and hide underneath or rush to lock himself in the pantry or slip out to the upper deck via the ladder anymore. Maybe they should have told everyone sooner. Ah, but the idea of keeping Sanji and the things he did all to himself was very attractive, and hiding had its own thrill to it, too.\nAs Zoro lazily considered these things, Sanji began to fuss in his arms. At first, it was just a light tapping rhythm of his finger. Soon, though, he was playing with a button on his shirt, then worrying the hem of Zoro\u2019s sleeve, then tugging, just a bit, at the ends of his bangs. Finally, Zoro had enough of it. \u201cCook\u2026\u201d he said testily, though he followed it with a small kiss to blonde hair.\nSanji sighed, digging his face in further to Zoro\u2019s chest. Zoro gave him a moment, knowing a number of ways to get whatever was bothering him out if he didn\u2019t fess up willingly.\n\u201cSo, uh,\u201d Sanji said, most likely well aware of all of Zoro\u2019s ways, \u201cYou\u2019re really okay with, you know, doing it again?\u201d\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d Zoro said, frowning down at him, \u201cThe wedding? I\u2019ve said as much before, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Sanji said, shrugging and lifting himself enough to look at Zoro\u2019s face, \u201cBut now it\u2019s all a lot more real. Everyone knows now, so we can start, like, actually planning, and stuff.\u201d\nSanji had trailed off at the end of his sentence, looking away, but Zoro brought his hand to Sanji\u2019s chin and made him turn to look at him once more. Zoro looked in those blue eyes with all the calm resolution and sincerity he felt, \u201cI would do anything to get to marry you again.\u201d\nSanji looked owlishly up at him. He blinked. He blinked again. Small patches of red blossomed in his cheeks. The patches grew, engulfing his pale skin, until his whole face was red, blush reaching to the tips of his ears and bleeding down to his chest, and he just kept getting redder. Zoro smirked.\n\u201cHoly shit, shut the fuck up, you asshole!\u201d Sanji sputtered, sitting up to choke Zoro around the neck, but not actually squeezing. He looked furious except for his eyes which were full of glee.\n\u201cGet off me, crap-cook!\u201d Zoro protested, laughing, lightly attempting to dislodge him but really just using it as an excuse to caress his wrists.\n\u201cNo way! I have to kill you before you kill me first pulling crap like that!\u201d he was laughing too, his fa\u00e7ade easily broken.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fight you want\u2026\u201d Zoro said, switching tactics. He relinquished his wrists to put a hand in Sanji\u2019s hair, pulling him forward suddenly enough to catch him off-guard, and crashing their lips together.\nSanji hummed into the messy kiss, hands releasing their mock hold so that one could rest on his collarbone and the other could thumb circles at his cheek.\nThey parted, breaths hot and mingling, for just a moment before meeting again, softer this time. The gentle press of Sanji\u2019s soft lips against his was nothing but pure heaven. It was all he could ever want and more, and it was all freely given by a man who loved him.\nThey parted once more, and Zoro looked up at his beautiful husband, the overhead lighting of the galley giving him a halo that was well deserved. Sanji gave him a smile that Zoro would kill a thousand men for.\nHe knew he was being uncharacteristically goopy \u2013 even within their private moments, this was a bit much \u2013 but he just couldn\u2019t help it; an evening of reliving memories had dredged up so much fondness, his heart was simply overflowing with the syrupy feeling. On top of that, he was simply too emotionally drained to put up his usual front, especially when Sanji would only see right through it anyway. \u00a0\nSanji looked down at him equally as goopily, so he felt no shame in this allowance.\n\u201cWhy do you ask, though? About the wedding?\u201d Zoro said, furrowing his brow as he brought them back to their previous point. \u201cIt was your idea in the first place. Do you not want to anymore?\u201d\nSanji rolled his eyes at him. \u201cOf course I do, dummy,\u201d he said, which was a little uncalled for when all Zoro was doing was showing he cared, \u201cI just need to make sure you are. It\u2019s a whole lot of doing stuff in public, you know? You\u2019d have to say your vows again, out loud, in front of everyone.\u201d\n--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, Roronoa Zoro,\u201d he swallowed thickly. He\u2019d rehearsed these lines in his head a thousand times over but saying them with his voice was something else entirely. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A soft squeeze of their joined hands brought his attention back. Blue eyes full of sincerity met his. Right. He could do this. For him, he could do anything. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI give you my whole heart to have and to hold, and promise to do so with your heart if you will let me,\u201d he felt the enormity of his own words. He reveled, rather than drowned, in it. He slipped the chain bearing his ring over golden hair.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForever.\u201d\n\n--\nZoro\u2019s face grew warm at just the thought. It really would be embarrassing to announce in front of everyone he knew how he felt. And yet, a possessive part of him didn\u2019t mind it one little bit. In fact, that part of him wanted to tell every single passerby on any street of any island, \u201cYes, this is mine, he let me be his, all mine and no one else\u2019s, just for me, forever.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to say yours too,\u201d he says in lieu of revealing such desires.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Sanji said, looking contemplative for a moment. Then, a smirk came to his face. \u201cYou gonna cry again when I do?\u201d he teased.\n--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, Blackleg Sanji,\u201d he stops, tears welling up in his eyes. His smile doesn\u2019t falter for even a second. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A blessed hand reached up, whipping wetness away from his own eye. It rests there on his cheek, warm and gentle. A sniffle and a shaky breath, and then he continues.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPromise to care for you always, and to let you care for me in return. To be each other\u2019s forever.\u201d\n\n--\n\u201cI only cried because you did!\u201d Zoro protested, now even redder.\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sanji slyly smiled, unconvinced.\nZoro huffed at him. The hands that were resting on the small of Sanji\u2019s back wrapped further around the other\u2019s lithe frame, trapping him to Zoro\u2019s chest. His captive secured, Zoro gave him a punishment he deserved and tickled him mercilessly.\n\u201cHey! Hahaha! You algae-heehee-brain!\u201d Sanji scowled between giggles, wriggling in his hold.\nZoro didn\u2019t let up, smile maniacal as he enjoyed Sanji\u2019s struggle.\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Sanji yelled, laughing harder. He thrashed, trying to get away from those fingers, and ended up sending his body weight towards the open side of the couch. Zoro continued to refuse to relinquish his grip, so the pair was sent over the edge, Zoro just barely fitting a hand behind Sanji\u2019s head as they met the floor hard.\nSanji\u2019s breath was knocked out of him once as he landed and once again as Zoro landed on top of him. Zoro sat up on his elbows and looked down at him. Sanji looked up at him. A beat passed. They broke into laughter, dissolving into a pile of giggles and mirth.\n--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their captain, who found them, who brought them here, who they\u2019ll follow to the ends of the earth, stands before them, smiling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI now pronounce you,\u201d he says, reading from a card, \u201cMr. and Mr. Roronoa!\u201d\n\n--\nZoro\u2019s insides felt impossibly light, watching Sanji\u2019s flushed face as his thousand-sun smile shined at him. He meant what he said: he\u2019d do anything to marry this man again and again and again and again. As many times as he would have him.\n--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sunset burns red across the sky, their shadows becoming long and merging into one. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He reaches a hand into blond hair and dips him, unable to control himself.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soft lips press against his, the kiss lovingly marred by their inability to stop smiling.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was now tied to this man\u2019s side forever.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He would have it no other way.\n\n\u00a0"
