    "text": "It turned out that Heaven would leave earth alone for two years before trying to start the apocalypse again, but this time, they had not even attempted to contact Aziraphale and Crowley, but went straight to the source: Adam.\nIt had been the most peaceful two years of Aziraphale\u2019s life. He felt free for the first time in his existence without the other angels breathing down his neck, or Heaven\u2019s strict ideology making him feel guilty over being with Crowley. Speaking of which, he and Crowley spent more time than ever together. They didn\u2019t live together, but spent enough time in each other\u2019s respective homes that they might as well have. Without Hell on his tail, Crowley was more at ease, too. He was still the mischievous old serpent he always was, but he laughed more now, and didn\u2019t shove Aziraphale up against a wall when he called him nice.\u00a0\nStill, they weren\u2019t anything more than friends, which...Aziraphale had mixed feelings about. He knew now, as he realized in 1941, that he was deeply in love with Crowley. He wanted to be with him as much as possible, but 6,000 years of denial and self-loathing were difficult to shake. He wanted to embrace Crowley, shower him with love and kiss him for days on end (since they didn\u2019t need air, he could do that, in theory). But he spent so long believing angels were not supposed to feel desire that he was afraid to act on his emotions. Plus, there was the whole issue of how Crowley felt. Aziraphale knew Crowley cared for him, but there was a difference between romance and friendship. Could Crowley feel romance? Could any demon? He was genuinely unsure. Crowley may have differed from the other demons, but he was still Fallen.\u00a0\nSometimes, he would give him a look without his sunglasses and Aziraphale thought maybe, but other times he thought it a ridiculous notion. He couldn\u2019t even feel love coming from Crowley, and wasn\u2019t that proof? He wanted more, but imagined Crowley laughing cruelly at him once he confessed his love. The logical side of him knew Crowley wasn\u2019t cruel, not towards him, but the fear of ruining what they had forever was strong. He was so afraid to love for so long, and if his love were to be met with scorn, Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sure he could recover from it. Despite this, his heart sped up when Crowley would look at him with what he could only describe as fondness every time.\u00a0\nOn one memorable evening, after too many drinks and popping a bad film into Crowley\u2019s DVD player, Aziraphale had fallen asleep, lulled into relaxation by the wine, cushions of the sofa, the hum of the television, and Crowley\u2019s deep voice commenting on the plot every couple minutes. He rarely slept, but letting his guard down after the failed apocalypse had its side effects. He hadn\u2019t even realized he fell asleep until he felt a light shaking on his chest, not enough to startle him, but enough to pull his alcohol-laced brain out of slumber.\n\u201cWha?\u201d he had mumbled inelegantly, eyes closed.\n\u201cWake up, angel,\u201d Crowley had said in a hushed voice. \u201cThe film\u2019s over.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s eyes snapped open, and were met with dark sunglasses. Even with them on, Crowley\u2019s features were kind.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Aziraphale sat up, unused to being caught in a state as vulnerable as sleep around anyone else, especially not him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the corners of Crowley\u2019s lips had quirked up. \u201cNot a problem at all. You can stay, if you like, but I wanted to give you the option to go home.\u201d\n\u201cI,\u201d Aziraphale stumbled to his feet, \u201cI should head home, actually. Thanks, um, Crowley, for the night.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s tiny smile was gone. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Goodnight, Aziraphale.\u201d\nIt was a moment Aziraphale kept playing in his head over and over. He kept remembering Crowley\u2019s face, his voice, the way he had woken him up with consideration. Did it mean anything? That night made him realize that, as much as he wanted to shower Crowley with affection, he, well, wanted it the other way around, too. It was uncomfortable to admit that he desired care and intimacy, but he found himself imagining what it would be like if Crowley\u2019s arms were around him, holding him close, if he rested his head on his thin chest and listened to his heartbeat in a cozy corner of his bookshop...\nThe bottom line was that Aziraphale didn\u2019t know, two years later, whether or not he should act on his gut feeling or listen to his brain.\nHe was shaken out of his reverie when he realized Crowley was calling him. Speak of the devil. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cAziraphale, Adam just called me.\u201d\nAziraphale got a sinking feeling. \u201cOh no.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. He said it\u2019s an angel. Up for a trip to Tadfield?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Aziraphale said, taking off his reading glasses. After the averted apocalypse, Crowley had given Adam is phone number.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he had said, \u201cyou probably know that these jerks won\u2019t leave you alone forever, right? If any angel or demon comes and bothers you, just call. We\u2019ll be there.\u201d\nAdam had nodded with a sigh. \u201cNo offense, but I hope I never have to call you.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken,\u201d Crowley said easily, \u201cI agree.\u201d\n\u201cDid he saw what angel it was?\u201d Aziraphale asked in the present day.\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t think he knows who\u2019s who, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. When will--?\u201d\nHe heard a horn honk outside.\n\u201cI\u2019m here now. Get a move on, angel.\u201d\nIn the car, both of them were on edge. Whoever the angel was, they had to be looking for trouble.\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d have more time,\u201d Aziraphale said quietly, looking out the window.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope we can send whoever it is away and get back to ignoring Heaven and Hell.\u201d\n\u201cHas Hell contacted you?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Crowley said, popping the \u2018p\u2019. \u201cStill not a word from them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, good.\u201d Aziraphale looked at him, feeling a little ache in his chest. He did hope everything worked out today, and not just for humanity\u2019s sake. He wanted to get back to peace in his bookshop with Crowley. After thousands of years of work, he felt he deserved a nice holiday for quite some time. Crowley deserved time off, too. He had revealed to Aziraphale just how much he hated being down in Hell, and he only went there when he absolutely had to. Aziraphale felt sorry for him, and a part of him wanted to protect Crowley from the miseries of Hell, as ludicrous as the sentiment was.\nCrowley raised an eyebrow and glanced over at him, the corner of his yellow eye visible from this angle. \u201cWhy you staring at me?\u201d\nAziraphale looked away immediately, back out the window. \u201cApologies, I got lost in thought.\u201d\nCrowley hummed noncommittally.\u00a0\nIt was getting harder to hide his feelings in general lately, but he was just thinking about how much he loved Crowley before he called. He needed to snap out of it. They had more important things to worry about at the moment.\n\u201cHope we can get done with this soon,\u201d Crowley muttered. \u201cMaybe we can be back in London for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d Aziraphale smiled lightly, and fought away the little bit of warmth he felt at Crowley wanting to have dinner with him. They did it countless times by now, but it always made him feel, well, wanted. Oh, what an absurd fool he was.\u00a0\nCrowley took a sharp turn, and Aziraphale gasped. \u201cCrowley!\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna get there fast or not?\u201d he asked with a smirk.\nHe did, but still hated being in a car moving this fast! \u201cUgh, I need music,\u201d Aziraphale said, fumbling with the nearest CD case and putting it in the player.\n\u00a0\n\nLove of my life, you've hurt me\n\n\nYou've broken my heart and now you leave me\n\n\nLove of my life, can't you see?\n\n\nBring it back, bring it back\n\n\nDon't take it away from me, because you don't know\n\n\nWhat it means to me\n\n\u00a0\nAziraphale felt heat slowly crawl up his collar. He didn\u2019t expect a song like this to be in Crowley\u2019s collection. He risked glancing at him.\nCrowley was staring ahead at the road, but his grip was tight enough on the wheel for the skin of his knuckles to be white and taut, his jaw clenched, and...was there a hint of pink on his face?\nAziraphale\u2019s lips parted, and he swallowed audibly. \u201cUm, Crowley? What\u2019s this--?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s by Queen,\u201d he said through clenched teeth, not looking at him. \u201cGotta suffer through the soppy ones to hear the cool ones.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s shoulders drooped. \u201cYes. Of course,\u201d he mumbled, disappointment creeping over him.\nCrowley parked the car crooked on the road and sauntered out, slamming the door. \u201cAw, shit,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Aziraphale asked, stepping out of the car. They were in front of Adam\u2019s house, and he saw a small crowd in the distance, in the field behind the backyard. Even from here, he recognized the silhouette. \u201cDamn.\u201d He hadn\u2019t heard a word from Gabriel since the failed apocalypse, and Crowley hadn\u2019t seen him since the body swap, but there he was.\nExchanging a look, they rushed over.\nAdam and his friends were glaring at Gabriel. They were a little older now, but had the same fierce looks in their eyes as they did at the air base.\n\u201cWill you please?\u201d Gabriel sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re trying my patience.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Adam shrugged, unimpressed. He looked past Gabriel. \u201cOh, you\u2019re here.\u201d\nGabriel spun around, features hard on his chiseled face. \u201cHow great. What are you two doing here?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we should be asking you,\u201d Aziraphale said, stepping beside Adam. \u201cHello, Adam,\u201d he flashed him a quick smile.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here to reason with this young man,\u201d Gabriel said, plastering a fake smile on his face. \u201cHe\u2019s so smart, after all, that he\u2019ll surely come to realize why he should fulfill his destiny.\u201d\n\u201cI already told you I\u2019m not interested!\u201d Adam shot back.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been telling you since you showed up uninvited,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u201cBut he\u2019s only postponing the inevitable,\u201d Gabriel insisted, violet eyes cold behind his cheesy smile. \u201cThe Great Plan will happen one way or another.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a know-it-all,\u201d Brian said.\nAziraphale bit his cheek to hide his smirk when Gabriel\u2019s lip twitched.\n\u201cAs long as I can help it, the world will keep going,\u201d Adam said, seeming to grow bored. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t kill me, because that would be against the Plan.\u201d He smirked. \u201cRight?\u201d\nGabriel was glowering now, and Crowley laughed.\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Crowley told Adam. \u201cHe can\u2019t do a thing to you, and he\u2019s furious over it. Look.\u201d\n\u201cShut it, creature,\u201d Gabriel snapped.\nProtectiveness swept over Aziraphale. Gabriel had no right to call Crowley names. He opened his mouth to tell him so, but Pepper spoke before him.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you all creatures?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cNone of you are human...which is still weird to think about, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot be lumped with him,\u201d Gabriel pointed at Crowley. \u201cI\u2019m a divine being and he\u2019s a demon. He\u2019s evil and a bastardization of God\u2019s creation.\u201d He smiled. \u201cOh, that rhymed. I\u2019ll have to remember that one.\u201d\n\u201cCocky bastard,\u201d Crowley muttered. To others, he may have looked aloof behind his sunglasses, but Aziraphale could tell by the subtle slump in his posture that Gabriel\u2019s remark bothered him.\nAziraphale was growing truly angry now.\n\u201cI dunno, you don\u2019t seem much better,\u201d Adam said casually.\n\u201cBurn!\u201d Pepper laughed.\nGabriel looked beyond insulted. \u201cWhy, you little--! I am one of the holiest beings in Creation!\u201d he spluttered.\nCrowley looked back at the kids. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you lot run along and go whatever it is kids do? You\u2019ve already told him off, he can\u2019t hurt Adam, and we can get him to leave.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d\n\u201cNot saying you are,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cbut he\u2019s wasting your time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he is,\u201d Adam agreed. \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be no forever. I\u2019m gonna go play with my friends now. Thanks, you two,\u201d he said to Crowley and Aziraphale.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Aziraphale gave him a bright smile, but still burned with anger inside. Honestly, Crowley was far from evil, or a bastardization. Gabriel would never think otherwise, though, the colossal moron that he was. \u201cWe can take it from here.\u201d\nThe kids went away, laughing about how weird their day was and that Gabriel\u2019s suit was tacky.\u00a0\nOnce they were out of earshot, Gabriel shot daggers at Aziraphale and Crowley. \u201cYou\u2019re deluding yourselves. The war will commence one day.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Crowley waved his hand dismissively. \u201cWhatever you say. Why don\u2019t you float on back to Heaven and stop bothering children? Creep.\u201d\nGabriel had an icy smile on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think you are to talk to me this way, demon, but I\u2019m the archangel fucking Gabriel.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, thanks for the reminder,\u201d he drawled, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cYou beast,\u201d Gabriel spat.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call him those things!\u201d Aziraphale chastised him, fists clenching. \u201cIt\u2019s very unbecoming of an angel.\u201d\nCrowley looked at him, a little surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to--\u201d\n\u201cUnbecoming of an angel?\u201d Gabriel interrupted him. \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor, and you dare lecture me on how to be an angel, and in defense of a demon?\u201d\nAziraphale was afraid of him for a long time, but he was rather tired of Heaven treating them both like garbage. After some distance and not answering to Heaven anymore, he felt liberated. Gabriel tried to murder him, for goodness\u2019 sake! He owed him nothing, not a single ounce of the respect he once had for him. Angels were meant to be merciful, but if it were up to Gabriel, he would have been extinct by now. Why should he show any mercy towards him? Huh. Crowley really was having an influence on him. \u201cI do dare,\u201d Aziraphale insisted, lifting his chin. \u201cI will not have you speak to my friend in such a manner.\u201d\nGabriel\u2019s eyes shifted between them, his emotion unreadable. \u201cMichael told me about you two right before Armageddon was supposed to happen. I saw the pictures. You\u2019ve been a traitor for a long time, right under our noses.\u201d\n\u201cIf having a friend is being a traitor, then so be it,\u201d Aziraphale said. He would have never been able to do this two years ago, but he now knew he didn\u2019t want Heaven\u2019s respect. Heaven, itself, was not worth respecting after clamoring for a war that would wipe out humanity. Besides, if he really did something wrong, he would Fall, and so far, God seemed okay with his actions. \u201cI refuse to believe companionship is wrong.\u201d Even if it were wrong, they had been through so much, and Aziraphale didn\u2019t want to give up their relationship for anything. Not anymore.\nCrowley was oddly silent beside him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be friends with someone like him,\u201d Gabriel laughed in disbelief. \u201cI really don\u2019t. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand a lot of things,\u201d Aziraphale said. He was getting tired of this. Adam was gone, Gabriel had been dismissed by kids, and the afternoon was slipping away. He wanted to go home. \u201cCrowley, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cSo what, do you two live together now?\u201d Gabriel asked, lip curling in disgust.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said, as Crowley said, \u201cNone of your business.\u201d\nGabriel looked at them with incredulity. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable. You really choose to spend time with one of the Fallen.\u201d\n\u201cI get you don\u2019t know what having a friend is like,\u201d Crowley started, voice low, \u201cbut it\u2019s really not unbelievable.\u201d\nGabriel rolled his eyes. \u201cDid I say you could speak?\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Aziraphale told him sternly. \u201cI already told you not to speak to him that way.\u201d\n\u201cDefensive, are you?\u201d Gabriel smirked. \u201cUriel did say you were like boyfriends. If you\u2019re going to go against Heaven, then why not go all the way, huh?\u201d he laughed.\nAziraphale couldn\u2019t stop the blood from rushing to his face. This was getting too personal. He already had a hard time pushing down his emotions today, and he didn\u2019t need this. He didn\u2019t care about what Gabriel thought of him anymore, but the matter of his heart was his concern, and his alone. He looked over at Crowley.\nCrowley wasn\u2019t looking at either of them, his face turned down towards the ground and his hands were in his pockets, a deep frown pulling down his lips and a furrow in his brow.\nOh no. The boyfriend remark made him uncomfortable. Crowley never got embarrassed, but that was the only way Aziraphale could describe the look on his face. That was evidence, then, that Crowley didn\u2019t feel the same way. He only saw him as a good friend. Gabriel had to go and make things awkward. What if Crowley didn\u2019t talk to him for decades after this? No, no, Aziraphale could salvage this. He could just write it off as a baseless accusation. Crowley wasn\u2019t inclined to believe Gabriel about anything, anyway. He just had to play the part.\nAziraphale\u2019s chest felt heavy. \u201cI...U-Uriel didn\u2019t know what she was talking about.\u201d He hated that stammer in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re not that. Never have been.\u201d The words hurt to say.\n\u201cThen why the fuss?\u201d Gabriel laughed again, seeming to really enjoy this.\n\u201cBecause he deserves more than your scorn!\u201d Aziraphale snapped, losing all patience, pushed to the limit. He felt the need to spread his wings to intimidate Gabriel away from them. It was, he supposed, a very primitive feeling. \u201cCrowley is better than any of the angels in Heaven who were preparing for bloodshed two years ago, and I won\u2019t have you stand here and spout such nonsense about him. Leave us alone.\u201d Once the words left his lips, Aziraphale thought Gabriel would grow furious with the notion that a demon was better than he was. That didn\u2019t happen. In fact, surprise came instead of anger.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Gabriel\u2019s eyes widened, hand coming to rest upon his chest. The smugness left his face, instantly replaced with realization and a hint of horror in his eerie, violet eyes. He was quiet for a long, unbearable pause.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, what?\u201d Crowley asked, lifting his head.\nGabriel was staring at Aziraphale, looking positively astounded. \u201cI feel it. I, this has been around you for a long time, but I feel it even more now. I guess because he\u2019s actually here with you.\u201d\nAziraphale shifted on his feet anxiously, dread in the pit of his stomach. \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou love him,\u201d Gabriel said, almost in awe. It wasn\u2019t an accusation, but a statement of fact.\nCrowley\u2019s jaw dropped with an audible intake of breath and his sunglasses slid down the bridge of his nose. He whipped around to him.\nAziraphale wanted to bolt. He couldn\u2019t bear to look at Crowley for another moment, so he ripped his gaze away, heart hammering painfully in his chest. \u201cI--I have no idea what you\u2019re on about,\u201d he denied, voice higher in pitch than usual.\nA malicious smile slowly spread on Gabriel\u2019s face, eyes mocking and delighted. \u201cYou\u2019re even more pathetic than I thought,\u201d he said softly.\nAziraphale stepped backwards, all of his earlier confidence rapidly draining out of him in an instant. Crowley\u2019s gaze burned into the side of his face. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d he protested pointlessly.\nGabriel chuckled then, quiet and low. \u201cHello? Archangel? I know love when I feel it,\u201d he turned to Crowley, \u201cand this angel has boatloads for you. I know you can\u2019t feel it anymore, but trust me,\u201d he patted his chest, \u201cit\u2019s there.\u201d\nCrowley was still as stone, jaw still dropped, yellow eyes the size of dinner plates behind his lowered glasses, astonished.\nAziraphale was certain he was scarlet. He hadn\u2019t felt this particular brand of awful before. He went through a lot in his long life, but being exposed and humiliated to the love of his life by his would-be murdering ex-boss? He never felt a pain quite like it. Their post-apocalypse bliss was destroyed, all plausible deniability out the window. It felt like his heart was stabbed, stinging and bleeding into his chest and sending waves of desolation through his veins. \u201cI,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI feel love for all God\u2019s creatures, as do all angels.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, no, no,\u201d Gabriel laughed again, apparently finding all of this amazingly humorous, rocking back on his heels, \u201cI feel no love for the damned. Plus, I feel the difference between angelic love and romantic love, idiot.\u201d\nAziraphale could say nothing more. He wanted to hide, and wished he had Crowley\u2019s snake transformation ability so he could go down in the grass and slither away.\nCrowley was breathing heavily beside him, chest and shoulders visibly moving up and down with each inhale and exhale. He still hadn\u2019t blinked or closed his mouth. His hands were trembling ever so slightly by his sides.\nAziraphale was inconsolable. He wanted to go home and cry, which was something he never did, ever. He just felt like he needed to expel all of the misery from his body, but knew crying wouldn\u2019t actually reverse what had just happened. Nothing would.\u00a0\nGabriel clasped his hands together, smiling brightly at them. \u201cWell! This was an interesting turn of events. I think I\u2019ll go back to Heaven and tell the other angels. They\u2019ll have a laugh.\u201d He was about to snap back to Heaven, but halted his action, fingers in the air. \u201cOh, and Aziraphale?\u201d he asked playfully. \u201cYou know he\u2019s incapable of loving you back, right?\u201d He snapped his fingers, and he was gone.\nIt was a good thing he didn\u2019t need air, because Aziraphale\u2019s throat was so tight he was certain not even oxygen could pass through.\nCrowley blinked slowly, swallowing and snapping his lips shut. His yellow eyes were petrified, locked onto him intensely. \u201cAziraphale?\u201d he asked, voice fragile like glass.\nAziraphale couldn\u2019t do this. He couldn\u2019t. He had to--he had to run. He had to run immediately. Looking around and finding no one walking around the sleepy village at this hour, he extended his wings and shot into the sky, ignoring Crowley\u2019s cry of, \u201cNo! Wait!\u201d\nAziraphale flew up in the sky, high enough so no human below would be able to see. He just flew, not knowing where he was going or when he would stop. The wind bit his face, blowing back the streams of tears that leaked from his eyes. At least up in the sky, no one could hear his sobs. Eventually, after the sun set, he came across a mountain. He saw a wide ledge with a metal barrier, the area most likely used as a camping site during the summer. Seeing it was empty, he flew down to it. He sat on the ground, knees pulled up to his chest and wings wrapped around himself. He folded his arms atop his knees and buried his face in them, shaking. Why did someone as awful as Gabriel get to be an archangel, but someone as amazing as Crowley was thrown into Hell? It wasn\u2019t fair. It--oh, look at him. Even now, he couldn\u2019t help but gush over him. Gabriel was right. He was pathetic. Completely and utterly pathetic, a total failure of an angel.\n\nYou know he\u2019s incapable of loving you back, right?\n\nThat hurt the most, because Aziraphale knew. He knew and he didn\u2019t want to fully admit to the idea. He wanted some hope. Now, Gabriel was probably cackling at his expense with the other angels. He was the laughingstock of Heaven: the angel who fell in love with a demon. The angel who was head over heels for a being they considered drastically inferior. He could never face the angels again. If only he could have shut his mouth, then maybe his love for Crowley would not have been more palpable this time for Gabriel to have felt it. He hadn\u2019t been thinking. He got careless. Love made him stupid. Love hurt.\nAziraphale didn\u2019t know how long he stayed there, huddled up and shaking on the ground, but it was now dark and cold. He would probably have to fold up his wings eventually, although he supposed he could just say they were part of a costume if a human came by. He was too cold to put them away right now, and he also wanted to stay hidden. His wings were a soft, warm shelter from reality.\nThe sound of strong wind filled his ears, a big fwoosh blowing a breeze onto him. He didn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d a voice murmured in relief.\nAziraphale recognized that voice anywhere. He curled his wings tighter around himself, biting his lip, holding back a fresh wave of tears. He had made an idiot out of himself in front of Crowley more than enough for eternity. What was he supposed to say? It was like his heart had been cut out and was beating on the ground in front of him.\nA hand gently stroked his wing.\nAziraphale shivered involuntarily. Their wings were so sensitive. One touch could send them into ecstasy, and another into blinding pain. No one ever touched his wings before since they were so rarely out. He wanted to shout and tell Crowley to leave, but didn\u2019t have the strength to raise his voice.\nCrowley kept stroking gently, stepping closer and gently taking hold of both wings, pulling them apart to reveal him.\u00a0\nAziraphale lifted his head, jaw clenched tightly so it didn\u2019t shake.\nCrowley\u2019s own wings were extended, black as the night sky, and his glasses were off. He gazed down at him with sorrow. \u201cOh, angel,\u201d he breathed sadly.\nAziraphale shook his head roughly. \u201cGet away,\u201d he said hoarsely, throat scratchy from hours of disuse and weeping.\nCrowley didn\u2019t move or speak. He stared down at him, eyes were more gentle than Aziraphale had ever seen them. He sat down beside him on the ground, extended his left wing, and wrapped it around his form, like an arm wrapping around his shoulders.\u00a0\nNeither spoke for a long, tense moment. Aziraphale remembered the day they met in Eden when it rained for the first time. He lowered his knees, sitting in a more upright position to appear less vulnerable, as pointless as that was. He looked down at the ground. He didn\u2019t know what to expect, but Crowley using his wing to comfort him wasn\u2019t it. But he didn\u2019t want his pity, either. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cCan\u2019t you take a hint?\u201d\n\u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cif you truly want me to leave, I will. But not before we talk.\u201d\nAziraphale wasn\u2019t breathing, grateful for not needing to. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to say?\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s wing wrapped tighter around him. Aziraphale never had someone else\u2019s wing touch him before. The feeling almost made him dizzy. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Gabriel,\u201d Crowley said, looking up at the starry sky, \u201cbut that seemed like a weird lie even for him. I didn\u2019t know what to think\u2014how could an angel love the Damned?\u2014until I saw your reaction.\u201d\nMortification stung his face. If he spoke, his voice would have been wrecked, so he kept his mouth shut. He wanted to hide inside his wings again. His fists were clenched atop his thighs.\nCrowley\u2019s eyes were still on the stars. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time,\u201d he said, voice low enough to rumble. \u201cI didn\u2019t always know what for, but I got a feeling we could be something more. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s how you felt before today, I swear, but call it a hunch, I guess. No one, especially not an angel, ever showed me kindness the way you did, so I thought, \u2018yeah, maybe there\u2019s something there. He\u2019s special.\u2019 I gave you space, except when you were in trouble. I knew it was harder for you than me. I\u2019m used to breaking the rules.\u201d\nAziraphale didn\u2019t know where he was going with this, but didn\u2019t trust himself to speak.\nCrowley\u2019s shoulders moved up and down in a small sigh. \u201cAs I looked for you, I tried thinking of what to say, but it\u2019s hard. I dunno if I\u2019m doing a good job. It\u2019s shocking, being a demon but having an angel love you.\u201d\nAziraphale winced, feeling his wings shrink further in on himself. \u201cCrowley\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIf you want me to leave, I will,\u201d he said to the sky. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you need. A millennium. Or six.\u201d Then, his head turned down towards the ground. \u201cJust knowing how you feel...it\u2019d be enough to, you know. Keep me going.\u201d\nAziraphale was dumbfounded. This was not at all the scorn he feared. It wasn\u2019t even rejection. \u201cWha...What exactly would you be waiting for?\u201d he asked haltingly.\nCrowley hesitantly turned his face upwards to look at him from under his lashes. Despite the smoothness of his voice, there was a shade of fear in his eyes. He swallowed audibly. \u201cFor you to, well, be with me.\u201d His wing quivered around Aziraphale\u2019s shoulders.\nAziraphale didn\u2019t register a word he said for a beat, and then his heart was a jackhammer in his chest, the tips of his ears burning. \u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d\nDespite there being an almost hopeful raise of his eyebrows, he was pouting and giving him a look like he was the thickest person on the planet. Crowley suddenly leaned in closer, pressing his cool lips against his cheek. His lips lingered, ghosting warm breath on his skin before he pulled away with an anxious twist to the corner of his mouth.\nAziraphale didn\u2019t know what his face looked like, but it must have been cartoonishly astonished. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\nCrowley licked his lips nervously. \u201cA kiss. Humans do it when they love each other.\u201d He averted his eyes for a second. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not the reason behind every kiss, but it\u2019s one of them.\u201d\nAziraphale was breathing again, but erratically. \u201cI know what a kiss is, but I can\u2019t feel your love. I never could.\u201d A storm of conflicting emotions was swirling in him. \u201cI would feel these things. Don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s expression was wounded, lips parting. His shoulders slumped, but he swallowed and spoke again. \u201cI can\u2019t emit it anymore now that I\u2019m Fallen,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut it\u2019s there, you\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d He stammered a bit, saying a few nonsense syllables in the way Aziraphale found adorable. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bloody aura anymore, and I can\u2019t feel yours, but I know this is for real. Fucking Gabriel doesn\u2019t know shit. I can\u2019t speak for other demons, but I can love,\u201d he insisted, a hint of desperation in his tone. \u201cPlease believe me. I\u2019ll prove it, somehow.\u201d\nAziraphale looked away, unable to handle the open, unrestrained look of pleading on his face. He never saw Crowley look or act anything close to this way before. It made him guilty.\n\u201cAziraphale,\u201d he grasped his chin and turned his face back, forcing their gazes to meet, crestfallen. \u201cWould I lie to you?\u201d\nNo. He never did.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale shook his head, heart pounding.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he begged. Seeming to hear the tone of his own voice, Crowley let go of Aziraphale\u2019s chin, sheepish. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you this upset, ever, and for it to be because of me? Can\u2019t have that. It\u2019d keep me up at night. If this is too fast, okay. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d He shut his eyes, like he was gathering the strength to speak. \u201cBut don\u2019t send me away \u2019cause you think you don\u2019t mean the world to me.\u201d\u00a0\nAziraphale was speechless.\nCrowley opened his eyes and lowered them to the ground again, morose. \u201cSo. There. Now you know. I\u2019ll, uh, leave you alone for awhile.\u201d\nAnd suddenly, Aziraphale realized he did know what Crowley\u2019s love felt like. It felt like being begged to run away to the stars, like being offered a place to stay, like being rescued despite leaving off on bad terms. It felt like Crowley letting his guard down and spending time with him for no reason relating to Heaven or Hell, but just to enjoy each other\u2019s company. It felt like being told he\u2019d wait millennia. It felt like a chaste, daring and yet somehow shy kiss on the cheek. It would make sense if Crowley truly just could not emit his love anymore due to being a demon, but no emission did not equate being absent. Aziraphale, in a moment of weakness, let Gabriel screw with his mind. But it was better than feeling an aura; he felt Crowley\u2019s love in the human way.\nAziraphale lurched forward, grabbing his hand before he could move to leave. \u201cCrowley,\u201d he breathed, \u201cyou would truly wait for me, no matter how long, even if it would hurt you?\u201d\nCrowley gave him a weak smile, like he was trying to mask being let down. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve waited for a lifetime. It won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d\nHe ached for this ridiculous, shy, kind creature. He really did mean that much to Crowley...His nose felt stuffy, so he sniffed.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for doubting you. It wasn\u2019t simply that I thought you were incapable of this, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d feel such a thing for me.\u201d He felt really guilty now, but a glimmer of hope ignited inside him.\n\u201cWho else would I feel it for?\u201d Crowley asked, looking less anguished after the apology. \u201cAngel, you\u2019ve always been my priority and my favorite part of being on earth.\u201d\nAziraphale finally felt his grief melting away. \u201cMy dear, I was a fool for not seeing it.\u201d The tightness left his posture and his chest stopped hurting. \u201cYou\u2019ve loved me for a long time,\u201d he said, believing it now, lightness shoving away the tension in his muscles.\nCrowley\u2019s fingers twitched in his and he nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he rasped. \u201cYeah, I have. And...you? You\u2019ve loved me for a long time, too?\u201d\nSuch a simple, innocent question coming from Crowley made Aziraphale squeeze his hand. \u201cOh, Crowley, yes.\u201d He kissed his knuckles, impulsive from the sheer relief washing over him after such agony. \u201cPlease forgive me for listening to Gabriel.\u201d\nHe laughed a little, his features becoming less strained by the second. \u201cA demon forgiving an angel? What a role reversal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI feel awful for being skeptical of you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I forgive you,\u201d he said sincerely as a crooked, affectionate grin graced his lips. \u201cI could never stay angry at you long.\u201d\nAziraphale beamed with love.\nCrowley released a sigh of relief. \u201cThere\u2019s that angelic smile.\u201d\nHeavenly light began glowing off his wings.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s new,\u201d Crowley mused, looking up at his wings.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale looked, too, and uncurled his wings and put them over Crowley\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019S pretty,\u201d Crowley murmured.\nAziraphale couldn\u2019t stifle a giggle. \u201cI never heard you call anything \u2018pretty.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t help it, you drive me mad, angel,\u201d Crowley tried to say smoothly, but the glow revealed a furious pink blush on his face.\nAziraphale rubbed his thumb against the top of his hand. \u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d\nCrowley leaned in, eyes flickering down to his lips. \u201cCan I kiss you again?\u201d he whispered. \u201cOn this lips this time?\u201d\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d Aziraphale closed his eyes in anticipation.\nCrowley\u2019s lips met his, softly, wet from his licking them earlier. Aziraphale felt like his chest was overflowing with love, his wings glowing brighter. He was warm now, a flush on his cheeks from contentment instead of embarrassment now. He parted his lips, applying more pressure. He had engaged in sexual activity before, but the kissing that led up to it couldn\u2019t compare to this. It was so very different when doing it with a loved one. He wasn\u2019t doing it simply for the physical sensations, but because he needed to pour all of his love into Crowley. Thank heavens those clever humans invented kissing. He hadn\u2019t expected Crowley to kiss this carefully, however. He pushed him against a wall for calling him nice, but he was caressing his lips, moving slowly and without a hint of arrogant dominance. It was unexpected but not unwelcome at all. Kissing Crowley was like floating downwards into a comfy bed after a long day; it was like his exhausted soul was finally home.\n\u201cYou\u2019re different than I imagined you\u2019d be,\u201d Aziraphale told him, the words muffled into the kiss.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Crowley asked, completely dazed when he broke the kiss.\nAziraphale positively adored that facial expression and glowed brighter. \u201cYou\u2019re gentler.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s lovely pink blush turned scarlet. \u201cI--I--eh, um, what am I supposed to say?\u201d He scratched the back of his neck with the hand not holding Aziraphale\u2019s, looking up at the night sky. \u201cI shoulda known you\u2019d be all sappy.\u201d\n\u201cAre you bothered?\u201d\n\u201c...No.\u201d\nAziraphale heart was singing. He was a being in love, and now that he knew his sentiment was returned? He was free to shower him with affection. \u201cGood, because I\u2019m not quite sure I could stop, now that I\u2019m not pushing all this aside. Hiding this from you was terribly difficult, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Crowley chuckled a little.\u00a0\nAziraphale looked up at the sky, too, noticing how romantic the setting was. \u201cYou always liked space,\u201d he commented.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, wing curling around Aziraphale so the tips of the longest feathers were in his lap. \u201cI helped build a lot of it.\u201d\nAziraphale was unsure of how to respond. He so rarely heard about his pre-Fallen days. \u201cWell,\u201d he leaned in close, almost leaning his head on his shoulder, \u201cyou have every reason to be proud of your work, dear.\u201d\nCrowley turned his face, their noses almost touching, his eyes wet. \u201cAngel\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d a voice shouted from the distance.\nAziraphale and Crowley jumped up.\nA man had his car parked several feet away and he was approaching. \u201cAre you two okay--? Oh, what the fuck?\u201d his eyes widened.\nBugger. Their wings were out. What were they going to do?\u00a0\nCrowley snapped his fingers, and instantly they were in the Bentley.\nAziraphale looked around, whiplashed. They were still holding hands. \u201cCrowley, that man saw us!\u201d\n\u201cFor a second,\u201d he said. \u201cBut humans have been saying they\u2019ve seen supernatural things in nature for a long time now. Seeing two men with wings who vanished? If he\u2019s believed by anyone, it\u2019ll be by conspiracy theorists on the internet only.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\nThey stared at each other.\nThey laughed heartily.\u00a0\n\u201cYou naughty serpent,\u201d Aziraphale giggled.\nCrowley\u2019s laughter died down, but he was still smiling. He always had such a charming smile, and Aziraphale hoped he would see it more often. Their wings made them cramped in the car, so they put them away.\nCrowley\u2019s yellow eyes twinkled. \u201cHey, uh, wanna kiss again?\u201d\nAbsolutely. But making out all night in the car seemed uncomfortable, and they would surely be caught by a villager at some point. Aziraphale wanted Crowley all to himself, so they could love each other as long as they wanted. They could go on Aziraphale\u2019s bed, hold each other and kiss and\u2014-oh, they could do more. He could make love to Crowley. His eyes glazed over. That could be very nice indeed. \u201cWell, dear,\u201d his voice dropped without his knowledge, \u201cI would prefer if we continued this back in my bedroom above the bookshop. Are you agreeable?\u201d\nCrowley stared at him with huge eyes for thirteen seconds straight, then turned, and slammed his foot down on the gas pedal.\nAziraphale gasped sharply as Crowley sank down on his cock, hands tightening on his slim hips. \u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d\nA moan left Crowley\u2019s mouth, his arms wrapped around Aziraphale\u2019s neck, eyes closed and hair sticking to his forehead with sweat. His eyebrows were furrowed together like he was in pain.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Aziraphale asked, restraining himself from moving. It had been such a long time since he had done this, and of course, he had never done it with his sweetheart before (Crowley would surely discorporate him if he called him that).\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley nodded frantically, clenching around him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt, just, a lot from this angle.\u201d He sank down to the hilt and shivered, biting his lower lip.\nAziraphale held back a groan, needing to hold him closer, so he wrapped his arms around his waist. He was glad Crowley was in his lap because it allowed them to embrace. He could hardly believe this was happening. Just a few hours ago, he thought he had lost Crowley\u2019s companionship forever, but here they were, as close as could possibly be. Here he was\u2014loved. Crowley had smothered him with clumsy but enthusiastic kisses when they got into the bedroom, leaving Aziraphale euphoric and hungry to feel his naked skin against his. The physical sensations were getting overwhelming, along with his utter devotion to Crowley. He was struck by how right this felt.\nAziraphale started to buck his hips upward into the tight heat, spellbound by how Crowley\u2019s eyes shot open and another moan left his long throat. Aziraphale pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses against his neck, licking from his steadily beating pulse to below Crowley\u2019s ear. His lower half was consumed by heat and the rest of him full with adoration so strong it hurt. It was so hard to contain--it--\nHis wings sprung out of him, causing him to stutter his thrusts.\nCrowley\u2019s open mouth ticked up into a little grin. \u201cHeh, look at that. You\u2019re glowing again.\u201d\nAziraphale resumed his thrusting, embarrassed to have lost control like that, but pleased when the grin disappeared as Crowley moaned some more. \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he admitted, and angled his wings to wrap around Crowley protectively, supporting his back. Mine.\n\u201cThey\u2019re stunning,\u201d Crowley gasped, hissing slightly, turning his face with an unngggh! A bead of sweat trickled down his temple.\nAziraphale suddenly had a lump in his throat and swallowed. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, and meant it. He normally didn\u2019t care about what people thought of his physical appearance, but when it was Crowley, he found himself strangely seeking approval.\nPerhaps his tone caught his attention, because Crowley looked back at him as he panted, body moving up and down with each thrust, hazy yellow eyes raking him over. He cupped Aziraphale\u2019s cheek and kissed him hard, his thumb stroking his flushed face.\nAziraphale held him tighter, lightly licking his bottom lip and sucking it, earning a delightful whine as a reward. Aziraphale\u2019s love was taking his breath away, making him break the kiss and bring in a shaky inhale. He was finally giving into Crowley\u2014no, they were giving into each other, and so much freedom and joy was indescribable.\n\u201cFuck, angel,\u201d Crowley stroked his cheek again, his expression completely aroused but full of affection, as well. \u201cWow.\u201d\nAziraphale couldn\u2019t take being looked at like that, and he started to thrust harder, needing to let out the love brimming inside him somehow. His wings glowed gold behind Crowley. \u201cLet me see your wings,\u201d he told him. \u201cPlease, they\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d\nSomehow, the redness on his face deepened, and his silky black wings extended, high enough to drape over the back of Aziraphale\u2019s. \u201cShit, Aziraphale\u201d he cursed, biting his bottom lip again.\u00a0\nIt was a sexy thing to do, and it made the tingling in Aziraphale\u2019s groin grow more intense. He turned his face and kissed Crowley\u2019s palm. How did he think Gabriel was right even for a moment? Of course Crowley loved him. He took the pad of his thumb into his mouth, sucking.\nCrowley let out a genuine hiss through clenched teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re driving me fucking crazy.\u201d\nAziraphale felt crazy. How was he expected to maintain his sanity when he was the center of his favorite demon\u2019s attention? 6,000 years of denial were crashing down on him. His rhythm was steady as he pounded into Crowley\u2019s body, pleasure caressing his body with every movement. His head fell back against the headboard with a soft moan. \u201cCrowley, you feel sublime.\u201d\nLike outside, Crowley\u2019s wings quivered at that, feathers rippling and shining in the lamplight of the bedroom. His breaths were harsh and fast, the pupils of his eyes blown wide, but he looked insecure. \u201cIs it good?\u201d he asked in a small voice. He licked his lips, hand leaving Aziraphale\u2019s face, and wrapped his arm back around his neck for support.\nAziraphale\u2019s heart gave a hard thud. \u201cSpectacular. You\u2019re doing so well. You\u2019re everything I need,\u201d he told him honestly through a groan.\nCrowley\u2019s eyebrows pulled up into a furrow, expression painted with bliss and the need for reassurance. \u201cYeah?\u201d his voice cracked.\nAziraphale\u2019s wings held him closer, their chests brushing. It had been surprising to hear Crowley hadn\u2019t done this before, but it made him feel special. Crowley gave into him, and only him. \u201cYes, my love,\u201d he thrust harder into him, and tilted his hips to the side just so, hitting into that bundle of nerves.\nA strangled shout tore its way out of Crowley, his back and wings arching against the golden light from Aziraphale\u2019s wings. He looked magnificent. He quickly scrambled and buried his face into Aziraphale\u2019s neck, hugging him tightly, arms and wings shaking. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why\u2014ah! Why\u2019s it\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYour prostate,\u201d he explained, relishing his reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s q-quite the sweet spot, I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\nCrowley was too far gone to respond to that. Instead, he clutched and moaned and his nails dug into his skin. \u201cAziraphale! Azira--!\u201d his voice was hoarse and unsteady. \u201cAhhh, fuck, keep going, please, please!\u201d\nAziraphale knew no heavenly choir could hold a candle to the words spoken into his skin. His bollocks were pulling up and, damn, he was close. He was breathing roughly out of his mouth, thighs straining from Crowley\u2019s weight, cock engulfed in tight, white hot splendid heat.\u00a0\nCrowley\u2019s hands slithered up into his hair, gripping the white, sweaty curls tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s so fucking much,\u201d he whimpered into his neck. \u201cI need\u2014I need it, Aziraphale.\u201d\n\u201cI know, darling,\u201d Aziraphale kissed the side of his head, feeling the tidal wave of pleasure about to crash. Almost, almost. He felt stupid with affection, wings lighting the room more than the lamp. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Crowley was his, and always his, always ready to be by his side, always willing to accommodate his Heaven-fueled temper tantrums, always loving him. \u201cTell me you love me,\u201d he pleaded into Crowley\u2019s hair. \u201cI need to hear it,\u201d he admitted, his sweaty chest brushing up against Crowley\u2019s with each thrust. So close.\n\u201cUuungh,\u201d Crowley whined into his skin. \u201cI love you, my beautiful bastard angel,\u201d he cried. \u201cFor 6,000 years.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s climax was already overtaking him, his bollocks releasing and cock spilling into his body, thrusts completely erratic as he released a sob into Crowley\u2019s hair, eyes shut tightly. Those words were ringing in his ears like the sweetest violin in the world. He would always remember them, until the end of time and beyond.\nThen Crowley was clenching around him, spurting hotly onto their stomachs and chests, coming untouched, and muffling his yell into Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder. They rode out their climaxes clinging to each other for dear life, sucking air they didn\u2019t need into their lungs, trembling with aftershocks. Aziraphale tilted his hips down into the mattress so he could slip out of him and then lowered them backwards, his wings spread out against the mattress, the glow slowly fading. Crowley\u2019s wings relaxed, too, going limp behind him. He kept his face in the crook of Aziraphale\u2019s neck, huffing hot, damp breaths. Their hearts were beating rapidly against each other, sweaty bodies pressed together, sweat and semen mixing on their abdomens.\nAziraphale was sure he was never this happy before. For 6,000 years. Crowley was such a sweet dear when he let his guard down. Aziraphale opened his eyes, smiling. \u201cI suppose I should thank Gabriel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe got us together.\u201d\nCrowley bit his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t ever mention that fuckwit in bed again.\u201d\nAziraphale giggled, running a hand absentmindedly through Crowley\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m teasing.\u201d He remembered what Gabriel had said. \u201cI suppose Heaven is laughing at me, but the joke\u2019s on them.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Crowley yawned, rolling onto his back, and accidentally rolling onto Aziraphale\u2019s wing.\u00a0\n\u201cOuch!\u201d\n\u201cFuck!\u201d he sat up. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Aziraphale sat up and retracted his wings.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to put \u2018em away,\u201d Crowley pouted.\n\u201cFor cuddling, I think it\u2019s for the best.\u201d\n\u201cOi,\u201d he glared at him, copper hair sticking up, \u201cI don\u2019t cuddle.\u201d\nAziraphale found that he had the desire to be quite impish with the knowledge that Crowley was actually fond of him. \u201cSo you\u2019d be opposed if I lay down with my head on your chest?\u201d\nCrowley softened, and without a word he put away his wings and lay on his back, arms out, waiting for him.\nAziraphale pecked him on the lips and did as he said he would, curling up against his side and resting his ear over Crowley\u2019s heart, hearing its even beat. He miracled away the mess on their stomachs.\nCrowley wrapped an arm around his shoulder, nuzzling his nose into his hair. \u201cOkay, this is nice,\u201d he murmured with fake resignation. He let out another yawn. \u201cAnyway, Gabriel\u2019s a shit and I still want to kill him for upsetting you.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really care what he thought,\u201d he said. \u201cI only got so upset because I thought you didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d\n\u201cI still wanna kill him, and now you know you\u2019ve got me whipped,\u201d he murmured into his hair, sounding sleepy.\n\u201c\u2018Whipped\u2019?\u201d he asked in confusion.\nCrowley groaned. \u201cIt means I\u2019m loyal to you, totally gross and head-over-heels.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale smiled, kissing his chest. \u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d\nHe chuckled softly, the sound vibrating against Aziraphale\u2019s ear. Crowley was completely relaxed beneath him, Hell not haunting him for once. \u201cYa know...you didn\u2019t actually directly say you love me. Just putting that out there.\u201d\nAziraphale laughed and lightly smacked his thigh. \u201cYou devil. After all that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah!\u201d\nHis eyelids fluttered shut, the little bubble of affection he felt making the nearby lamp flicker. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Crowley,\u201d he whispered, \u201cquite desperately. Irreversibly, even.\u201d His soul felt light as air.\nCrowley sniffed. His heart beat a little faster. \u201cCool.\u201d\nAziraphale chuckled through a yawn. \u201cStop it, you.\u201d Something about relaxing with Crowley made him crave sleep. He supposed the vigorous love making didn\u2019t help.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to kiss in public so those arsehole angels can see,\u201d Crowley mumbled. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably spy on us sooner or later.\u201d\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d Aziraphale opened his eyes so he could roll them. \u201cWould that truly be necessary?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely. They need to be proven wrong after Gabriel insulted you.\u201d He gasped, sitting up and sending Aziraphale face-down on the mattress with an oof.\n\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d Aziraphale muttered, putting his head on the pillow.\nA dirty smirk brought Crowley\u2019s lips up into a curl, a wicked sparkle to his eye. \u201cAziraphale...does Gabriel still get notifications of every miracle you perform?\u201d\n\u201cUm, I suppose,\u201d he thought about it. \u201cI may not work for Heaven anymore, but I haven\u2019t been cast out, either. Why?\u201d\nCrowley wiggled his eyebrows.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou just miracled away our semen.\u201d\nAziraphale covered his face with his hands. \u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t thought of that!\n\u201cYes!\u201d Crowley laughed, immensely satisfied. He lay down and nuzzled Aziraphale\u2019s ear. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach him to mess with my angel,\u201d he said, voice husky. \u201cEvery time we have sex, you\u2019ll have to miracle it away.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled into his palms. My angel. He could get used to being called that.\u00a0\n\u201cYou like it deep down,\u201d Crowley wrapped his arm around his soft middle, kissing his temple.\nAziraphale lowered his hands, face burning. \u201cLord help me, but I do.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d Michael asked, entering Gabriel\u2019s office. \u201cYou never stay in here this long.\u201d\nGabriel was frozen, staring down at a piece of paper on his desk, horror and disgust on his face. He said nothing.\nMichael walked over and read the piece of paper over his shoulder.\n\nNotification of miracle from Principality Aziraphale, Guardian of the Eastern Gate: Miracled away human bodily fluids off his and the demon Crowley\u2019s bodies.\n\nThey stared down at the piece of paper for a long time.\nGabriel finally lifted his head. \u201cHe consorted with a demon.\u201d\n\u201cHe did more than consort. How has the Almighty not cast him out of Heaven?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. We can\u2019t kill either of them.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cDo you think...it is possible for a demon to love?\u201d Michael asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gabriel laughed weakly. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t be.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she didn\u2019t sound convinced.\nMore silence.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Aziraphale made the Effort,\u201d Michael said.\nGabriel shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best if we leave them alone,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cForever.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d"
