    "text": "\nOri\n\nBilbo relaxes at a table in the Prancing Pony and watches the tides of men as they make their way in and out of the door\u2014besides him and the dwarves, there are only men in the bar, but none of them seem to be paying his group much attention, thank the Valar. The last thing any of them need to is gain the attention of someone unsavory, and though Bilbo\u2019s never been to Bree before, he\u2019s heard stories.\u00a0\nThe dwarves had their own table, tucked in the corner of the room, but it had been hard enough to find one to sit thirteen, so after some pointed shuffling and looks Bilbo had gone off and found one just for himself. It had been oddly disappointing to be not-so-subtly nudged out of the way, but not really surprising; all the dwarves had made themselves clear on what they thought of their hired burglar, Thorin most of all.\u00a0\nGandalf\u2019s gone off somewhere, so Bilbo takes up a mead\u2014made in the Shire, for no Man has ever made anything so sweet and heady. He\u2019s starting to feel a little melancholy when he looks up to see Ori standing in front of his table, shifting from foot to foot and biting his lip.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bilbo asks, nonplussed by Ori\u2019s squirming.\nOri\u2019s one of the nicer dwarves\u2014younger than F\u00edli and K\u00edli, Bilbo\u2019s been told, but much less rowdy. But they haven\u2019t spoken much\u2014not, in fact, since the night at Bag End when Ori had found a book in Bilbo\u2019s library of hobbit folklore. Ori had asked before they\u2019d all retired for sleep if he could borrow it, eyes bright with curiosity and book clutched to his chest. Bilbo hadn\u2019t had the heart to tell the dwarf that he doubted it would be returned\u2014after all, they were all going to fight a dragon\u2014but had allowed Ori to take it anyway. Bilbo had read the silly thing more than once; his father had been the one to write it down, for Bilbo to learn his letters when he was just a fauntling. He hadn\u2019t looked at it in years\u2014not since his father\u2019s death.\nBilbo had seen Ori reading it on the way to Bree, but Ori never brought any further questions to him about hobbits, so Bilbo had decided not to ask.\u00a0\n\u201cMaster Baggins,\u201d Ori says, casting a furtive glance back at the table of dwarves. \u201cI wanted to thank you for your gift.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Bilbo says, surprised. \u201cIt was no problem, Master Ori. It\u2019s a small book and one I haven\u2019t read for many years.\u201d\nOri frowns at him. \u201cBut in the in scripting, it says\u2014authored by Bungo Baggins. Isn\u2019t that your da?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. He wrote it for me when I was a fauntling, y\u2019see.\u201d\nOri\u2019s starting to blush. \u201cI should not have asked to borrow it,\u201d he says. \u201cI will return it at once, I\u2019m so sorry, Master Baggins\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHave you finished it yet?\u201d Ori\u2019s hesitation is answer enough and Bilbo sighs. \u201cKeep it, Master Ori. It\u2019s doing a world more good informing a curious mind than sitting dusty on my bookshelf.\u201d\nOri wrings his hand. \u201cI will take care with it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd see it safely returned to you when I am finished.\u201d\nBilbo takes a long look at him; dusty from travel and earnest. He\u2019s the youngest of them all and possibly the most foolhardy, considering his posturing at Bag End, and Bilbo feels a little sad for him. To be so young and to come on a trip such as this? At least Dwalin and Balin and the others have had a life\u2014at least F\u00edli and K\u00edli are reclaiming a birthright!\u00a0\n\u201cYou may keep it, Master Ori,\u201d Bilbo says. He smiles, feeling a little mischievous. \u201cThink of it as a gift for having the good sense to inquire first about where the dishes went instead of just tossing them about as soon as you were done.\u201d\nOri\u2019s mouth drops open and he stares so long at Bilbo that Bilbo begins to think he\u2019s made some sort of mistake. Then, to Bilbo\u2019s surprise, Ori begins to blush.\u00a0\n\u201cI am honored by your gift,\u201d he says. Bilbo frowns at him, not sure why Ori seems so touched by something so simple, but then Ori\u2019s pulling something from his loose cardigan. \u201cI had thought to give this to you later, when we were not in everyone\u2019s company, but\u2014\u201c He shrugs and hands it over to Bilbo.\nIt is a book, similar to the one Bilbo let Ori have; small, but hardy, with a brown leather cover and a single golden rune (Khuzdul?) on it. Bilbo opens the first page and blinks when he realizes that the book is written in Westron: Tales of Dwarrow Mythology, a translation is written on its title page. The paper itself is as creamy and fine as anything in Bilbo\u2019s stock of stationary, and the calligraphy is neat and beautiful. Bilbo looks from it to Ori, who regards his examination with an anxious look.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely, Ori,\u201d Bilbo says, putting as much warmth in his voice as possible, for it seems that Ori is nervous of his opinion.\nOri relaxes. \u201cIt\u2014it is crafted of mine own hand,\u201d he says. The words are oddly formal and stilted, as if they\u2019re being recited, but Bilbo is too busy being astonished to notice over-much.\n\u201cYou wrote this!?\u201d he exclaims, examining it again. The calligraphy is so lovely! He flips a few pages in and blinks when he sees colorful pictures, detailed and tiny in paragraphs of text. \u201cBut that\u2019s amazing!\u201d\nOri\u2019s gone an endearingly deep shade of red. \u201cI am glad you approve of this gift,\u201d he mutters.\u00a0\n\u201cI will treasure it,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cThank you for your kindness, Master Ori.\u201d\nOri frowns at him, redness slipping away. \u201cBut\u2014are we not friends now, Bilbo?\u201d\nBilbo frowns at him, confused. He would not have thought any of the dwarves\u2014dwarrows, as they apparently called themselves\u2014would want his friendship, not even Ori, kind as he is. Perhaps the gift meant more than Bilbo thought . . . .?\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says and Ori relaxes again. \u201cI must apologize\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHobbits are so polite,\u201d Ori observes. \u201cBut between friends there is no need for manners, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He beams at Bilbo. \u201cMay I sit with you and drink, Bilbo?\u201d\nHe sits before Bilbo can say a word and orders his own tankard. Bilbo thinks he should probably be indignant about having his privacy invaded by this odd dwarf, but, as he fingers the warm leather of his new book and listens to Ori chatter about the days ahead, all he can feel is warmth.\n\nBombur\n\nOri becomes a permanent fixture at Bilbo\u2019s side as they ride out of Bree. They talk of folklore and once Bilbo encourages him, Ori expands on his own works\u2014he dabbles in translation, but is a scribe by trade. Bilbo\u2019s a little astonished, then a little ashamed at his own surprise\u2014after all, even if none of the dwarrrows had ever seemed prone to book-learning, weren\u2019t there plenty of hobbits who had never bothered to read a page in their lives? Ori laughs when he voices this thought, but admits that books are more of an oddity among the dwarves than any other race, as they prefer songs and spoken tales.\u00a0\nThe others in the Company seem strangely discomforted by Ori and Bilbo\u2019s new friendship. F\u00edli actually drops his knife when he hears Bilbo address Ori without a title for the first time! It\u2019s odd for a group that seemed to lack manners to put so much stock in proper address, but perhaps it is different for F\u00edli, being the heir to the throne and all that. Bilbo thought so for about two hours before Dori gave him a menacing look when he called Ori over to have dinner together!\nBut Ori seems to have straightened everything out\u2014everyone\u2019s giving odd looks to Ori now, as if they\u2019re not sure what part of his mind he had to lose to befriend Bilbo. It\u2019s enough to make a fellow self-conscious, their carrying-about, and Bilbo says as much to Ori after dinner as he smokes a bit of pipeweed as Ori scribbles in the book he keeps on hand to document their adventure.\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re just surprised,\u201d Ori says as he draws something that Bilbo\u2019s becoming increasingly suspicious might be his own profile. \u201cIt\u2019s not proper to go without titles and such if you haven\u2019t given a gift and since no one saw me give you one, they thought we were just being rude. I\u2019ve told Dori and it\u2019s all settled. I think they might be wondering what I did to get you to accept it, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Bilbo asks, frowning now, and Ori gives him a little smile.\n\u201cWell, we really don\u2019t know that much about hobbits, so we weren\u2019t quite sure how this sort of thing goes about.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s pretty sure that he\u2019s missing something, but Ori\u2019s being called over by Nori now, so it\u2019s too late to ask. Bother these dwarves and their strange customs! What on earth did gifts have to do with anything?\nThere\u2019s a soft poke to his shoulder and Bilbo jumps, choking on the bit of smoke he\u2019d already inhaled. Coughing, he turns to see Bombur watching him, round-eyed with concern.\n\u201cMaster Baggins?\u201d he asks uncertainly. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014startled me,\u201d Bilbo coughs out. \u201cSorry, sorry, just\u2014\u201c He manages to get his breathing to even and turns to face Bombur properly. It\u2019s only then that he notices Bombur\u2019s holding something that Bilbo had thought he wouldn\u2019t see for ages. \u201cIs that a cake?\u201d\nBombur\u2019s gone red. Bilbo feels a creeping sense of deja vu.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is crafted by mine own hands,\u201d Bombur mumbles as he shoves it toward Bilbo.\n\u201cHow on earth did you manage that?\u201d Bilbo asks, honestly perplexed as he takes it.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s still warm, for Yavanna\u2019s sake, and smells lovely. Tiny\u2014barely bigger than his palm\u2014but plump, it is almost Hobbitish. To think a dwarf baked it! From they way they treated Bilbo\u2019s food, he knew they had an appreciation for it, but he\u2019d never suspected any of them could bake like this!\u00a0\n\u201cAh, well, I had a chance to grab the necessary ingredients in Bree,\u201d Bombur says, speaking so fast that Bilbo can only catch the gist of what he\u2019s saying. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve made them fireside before, y\u2019know, on the road and what have you\u2014can\u2019t always have an oven, sadly\u2014so it was just a wee matter of using the right tools and knowing when to take it out of the fire\u2014\u201c\nBilbo bites into it, groans, and Bombur falls silent. Bilbo takes another bite, smooshing too much in his mouth so that he probably looks like a deranged chipmunk, but he can\u2019t care because it tastes so good\u2014Nutty and sweet, the cake wasn\u2019t like any Bilbo had tasted before\u2014and as a Hobbit, he prided himself on the number of cakes he\u2019d eaten in his life.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d he tells Bombur once he\u2019s managed to chew and swallow. \u201cIf you ever have reason to settle in the Shire, any number of lasses or lads would court you for your cooking skills alone.\u201d\nHe looks back when Bombur doesn\u2019t say anything and smiles a little. Oh, dear. That\u2019s a deep shade of red indeed.\n\u201cI am glad you approve of this gift,\u201d Bombur says. He\u2019s stuttering a little but he sounds sincerely happy.\u00a0\nBilbo pauses over the last bite of the cake. \u201cMaster Bombur,\u201d he asks, suspicious now because he\u2019d been distracted at the time but weren\u2019t those the exact words that Ori said\u2014?\nBut Bombur\u2019s face falls and gets that trembly look Bilbo recognizes from faunts on the edge of tears.\n\u201cWas it not satisfactory?\u201d he asks, thick-voiced. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just so difficult to make it the right taste on a cooking fire\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo!\u201d Bilbo yelps, so loud that several dwarrows nearby look over. \u201cNo,\u201d he says again, softer. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely lovely Bombur, and I thank you for making it for me. Don\u2019t even think otherwise.\u201d To think that Bombur could doubt his own skill! Bilbo won\u2019t allow that. \u201cWill you teach me your tricks?\u201d he asks, partly to see if it will cheer Bombur up and partly out of a selfish need to have as many of those cakes as possible. \u201cI would love to be able to make cakes as you do!\u201d\nBombur\u2019s gone wide-eyed. \u201cYou wish to learn my craft?\u201d he asks, so bemused that Bilbo thinks he might\u2019ve stepped in it somehow.\u00a0\n\u201cIf it\u2019s alright,\u201d he says, cautious now. \u201cOnly, I bake as well y\u2019see, so I just\u2014\u201c\nBombur smiles. \u201cOh, you are a baker as well! Well, I would be honored to expand your learning,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you not write books as well? Hobbits must be skilled to learn so many crafts!\u201d\u00a0\nBilbo\u2019s never going to understand dwarrows. And blast it all if Bombur doesn\u2019t get him talking about different Hobbit recipes for so long that he completely forgets to ask why he\u2019s getting these strange gifts and why everyone seems to think them an overture of friendship!\u00a0\n\nBalin\n\nThe night that Balin tells them all the story of Thorin\u2019s tortured and frankly astonishing past, Bilbo sits on a stump outside their camp and fiddles with his pipeweed. His favored pipe had broken nearly two days before in his pack\u2014one of the stoutest he\u2019d had, but stout for Hobbit lands was apparently not the same thing among dwarrows. He\u2019d asked Bombur and Ori if they\u2019d packed extra, but though they were always happy to share with him, they\u2019d only brought one each.\u00a0\nBilbo tries not to think about how many nights Thorin has gone without the comfort of a bit of pipeweed\u2014how many nights Thorin and the dwarrows he\u2019s traveling with have gone hungry or tired or friendless. He\u2019s heartsick at the mere thought of Thorin having to see his father decapitated, to see his grandfather go gold-mad, to lose his homes to dragonfire . . . Well, the list goes on, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0\nBilbo can\u2019t really fault Thorin now, for being a grump. If he\u2019d lived through half of what Thorin did, he\u2019d be a grump too.\n\u201cMighty pensive look on ye, laddie.\u201d\nBilbo smiles as Balin plops down to sit next to him\u2014their stump would be a tight seat for a Man, but it fits a dwarf and a hobbit easily enough.\n\u201cYou told us a mighty tale,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cI never realized I walked with legends, that\u2019s all, Master Balin.\u201d\n\u201cAch. Don\u2019t let Thorin hear you call him that\u2014hates being treated different, he does,\u201d Balin says, though he\u2019s smiling. \u201cI only hoped to help you and the lads understand him a bit better, that\u2019s all. Thorin\u2019s their Uncle, but F\u00edli and K\u00edli don\u2019t know much about the details of his past. Thorin\u2019s always preferred it that way.\u201d\nBilbo glances back to where Thorin sits, near the edge of the fire. He\u2019d accepted first watch, and he has a familiar brooding look to his brow. At the feel of eyes on him, Thorin looks up and catches Bilbo\u2019s gaze. Bilbo hurries to look away, flushing a little to be caught staring.\u00a0\n\u201cYou all admire him so much,\u201d he says to Balin. \u201cI suppose I can see why you\u2019ve all followed him on this mad venture now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, Master Baggins?\u201d Balin asks. \u201cWhy did you follow us?\u201d\nBilbo means to say something flippant\u2014a comment about the stubbornness of dwarrows, perhaps\u2014but finds that he can\u2019t on this night, when Thorin allowed his whole sad history to be laid down for all of them.\u00a0\n\u201cHe sang,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cYou all did, that night at Bag End, for this home that you all longed for.\u201d He hesitates, then adds, a little shy, \u201cI think anyone would have come running after him once they heard him sing.\u201d\nBalin stares at him, as shocked as Bilbo\u2019s ever seen him, then begins to laugh. Bilbo chances a glance over his shoulder and blinks with surprise when he realizes Thorin\u2019s gaze is still fixed on him, rather intently. And\u2014is that a blush?\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an odd sort, Master Baggins,\u201d Balin says, drawing Bilbo\u2019s attention away from the oddly appealing sight of a flushed Thorin Oakenshield. \u201cBut you\u2019re honest and you\u2019ve a willing heart. What more can we ask?\u201d He smiles. \u201cOri told me you\u2019ve broken your pipe.\u201d\nBilbo frowns, caught off-guard by the sudden subject change. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cA few days ago. Not a problem, it\u2019s just\u2014well, I like to think with my pipe, y\u2019see. Clears out the mind.\u201d\nBalin chuckles. \u201cOh I know, laddie. Which is why I have every confidence you\u2019ll use this well.\u201d\u00a0\nHe pulls something out of the folds of his cloak, but it\u2019s dark enough that Bilbo can\u2019t see it until it\u2019s deposited in his hands\u2014a sturdy pipe made of white stone, of all things, and easily one of the most beautiful pipes Bilbo\u2019s ever seen. He runs a reverent hand over it\u2014the tiny carvings of trees and flowers, little bees snoozing around the bowl! He\u2019s never seen such detailed work: though some hobbits do carve their favored pipes, they tend to be crude. To do such detailed work in stone must be even harder. Bilbo can\u2019t imagine the amount of work that must go into such a thing.\n\u201cMy word,\u201d Bilbo breathes, thoroughly astonished.\n\u201cIt is crafted of mine own hand,\u201d Balin says gently, eyes crinkling as he smiles.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is beautiful, Balin,\u201d Bilbo says.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s learned his lesson from Bombur and Ori\u2014there is something about the gift that means he stops with formalities, but he feels awkward to ask now.\u00a0\nBalin beams. \u201cI am glad you approve of this gift,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, I would love to try some of your Shire leaf, for I\u2019ve not had any before.\u201d\nBilbo straightens in indignation. \u201cNever had any\u2014! Why, how have you lived so long without any Old Toby?\u201d He reaches over and grabs Balin\u2019s pipe, stuffing it full of his hoarded leaf. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that, Balin, it\u2019s a disgrace! Have you\u2014don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been smoking the Men\u2019s weed, I wouldn\u2019t wish that even on my worst enemy\u2014!\u201d\nBalin laughs and draws a full breath of smoke. His blissful expression at the first inhale of Old Toby is enough to satisfy Bilbo that dwarrows do not have terrible taste in all things and clearly some of them have very good taste indeed.\nHe chances a glance back at the fire, but Thorin has already turned away and gone back to whatever thoughts trouble him. Bilbo tries hard not to sigh as he prepares his own pipe.\u00a0\n\nDori\n\nBilbo\u2019s miserable and he\u2019s tired and, most of all, he\u2019s wet.\nHe wants to go home. He wants to be in his little dry hole where he can huddle under his warm thick quilt and listen to the thud of rain against his house and drink some nice hot tea. He bemoans, not for the first time, ever running out of his door\u2014and, most importantly, running out of his door all willy-nilly, without even taking the time to pack properly first.\u00a0\n\u201cShoulda feckin\u2019 brought a gorram raincoat,\u201d he mutters, slipping into Hobbitish[1].\u00a0\nHis father hadn\u2019t approved of such speech, of course\u2014Bagginses were gentlehobbits and Bilbo had been raised to speak proper Westron\u2014 but his mother had taught him a variety of curses in Hobbitish. Sometimes it was on accident, like when she had dropped a pan on her toes, but mostly on purpose. She\u2019d been a strong believer in being able to curse fluently and creatively; she\u2019d even taught him some of the filthier elvish, though Sindarin never could quite stoop itself low enough to curse to their satisfaction.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a rumbling laugh behind him and Bilbo sits up quickly, his cheeks flushing. \u201cI mean, uhm\u2014\u201c\n\u201cStrong words from such a wee creature,\u201d Dwalin says as his pony shoulders past Bilbo\u2019s. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re made of stronger stuff after all, Burglar.\u201d\nBilbo gapes at his retreating back, but he can\u2019t help but feel a little pleased\u2014after all, besides Thorin, Dwalin was his biggest naysayer. Perhaps he should try out some of the more creative phrases his mother preferred when Dwalin happened to be nearby.\u00a0\n\u201cI could teach you a bit more than that if you like,\u201d Nori adds slyly as his pony comes up to Bilbo\u2019s.\u00a0\nBilbo can never quite get a handle on Nori\u2014or rather, most of the dwarrows make some sort of noise when they move, to the point where Bilbo can always hear them coming sooner rather than later; all except Nori.\n\u201cYavanna\u2019s gorram tits,\u201d he breathes and then slaps a hand over his mouth. That was a phrase his father had heartily disapproved of.\nNori\u2019s laughing now. \u201cMahal, you are dirty-mouthed for such a fussy little creature! Do all Hobbits talk like you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly the ones who want to get boxed \u2018round their ears,\u201d Bilbo mutters. \u201cOr if, like me, they are in a particularly frustrating situation.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, the lack of a cloak,\u201d Nori says. \u201cI would offer, but I\u2019ve none to spare\u2014most of us only brought what we\u2019d need for ourselves, since it would be such a long road, y\u2019see.\u201d His teeth gleam as he grins. \u201cIf we were near a town I\u2019d simply lift one off the shoulders of a Man, and you\u2019d have enough cloth to cover yourself twice over, Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo straightens in his seat, a little indignant. Twice over, indeed!\u00a0\n\u201cHobbits are a perfectly respectable size!\u201d he says and then undermines his own scolding when he sneezes, five in a row.\u00a0\n\u201cPoor hobbit,\u201d Nori says. He looks over his shoulder and back again, and that grin is something Bilbo knows to fear. \u201cHere\u2014I\u2019ll be a good dwarf and give you a hand, shall I?\u201d Then, for reasons only known to himself, he raises his voice and says, \u201cOh you poor wee thing! You\u2019re going to catch a cold, carrying on like that!\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s going to argue with him\u2014Hobbits may be small, but they\u2019re hardier than that!\u2014when he sneezes again and this time it\u2019s bordering on six or seven, all wet, booming, disgusting things.\u00a0\n\u201cI told y\u2019all I needed a feckin\u2019 handkerchief,\u201d he mutters he tries to rub at his nose with the sleeve of his ruined shirt. Disgusting.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll catch chill!\u201d Nori says, ridiculous and melodramatic. Who on Earth is he putting this show on for? \u201cProbably die on the road, frozen to your little toes!\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201c Bilbo starts. His toes are not little!\n\u201cNori, leave off the hobbit,\u201d someone says from his other side, and Bilbo twists around to see Dori regarding him with a weather eye. \u201cMaster Baggins, are you feeling alright?\u201d\nBilbo opens his mouth to answer, but Nori gets there first. \u201cOur hobbit is very delicate, Dori,\u201d he says. \u201cThis weather is going to make him quite ill! Look, he\u2019s already halfway to his death!\u201d\u00a0\nHe gestures to Bilbo as if Bilbo\u2019s on the edge of collapse and Bilbo would argue with him if he wasn\u2019t sneezing again the Valar be damned\u2014\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Dori says. He eyes Bilbo for a moment longer, then nods as if he\u2019s come to some sort of decision. \u201cWell. We can\u2019t have that, can we?\u201d\u00a0\nHe rides on ahead without another word, but Nori winks at Bilbo as he follows his brother. Bilbo watches them go in complete and utter confusion.\u00a0\nThey stop for rest somewhere along the road, but no one bothers to try and make a fire; the wood\u2019s too wet now, after days of being thoroughly soaked, and Thorin\u2019s paranoid about orc riders besides. Bilbo can\u2019t blame him, not after that story Balin told, but he\u2019s a little too grumpy to admit as much. Blast Thorin and his temper and arrogance and stubbornness\u2014\n\u201cMaster Baggins?\u201d\nBilbo jumps. He huddled down to sleep next to Gandalf, as he has since the start of their journey\u2014although the others have become friendlier, they all tend to sleep in family groups still, and Bilbo\u2019s hesitant to try and join in with any of them. Gandalf always sleeps on the outer ring of the Company, so Bilbo made a bed for himself nearby, outside the piles of dwarf bodies.\u00a0\nDori stands in front of him, grumpy under the wide brim of his hood. All the dwarrows brought some sort of waterproofed cloak to wear, the lucky bastards, but none of them had one to spare for sopping hobbits who hadn\u2019t even thought to bring a normal hood, let alone one to protect against rain.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you need something, Master Dori?\u201d Bilbo asks.\u00a0\nPoliteness is hard to hold on to when you\u2019re so miserable. Dori sighs in the put-upon way he adopts sometimes when dealing with Nori.\u00a0\n\u201cYou must not catch cold,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I doubt it will help much, but here.\u201d He holds out a wing of his cloak and offers a bundle of cloth. Bilbo can\u2019t see much in the darkness, but it looks green. \u201cA cloak for you. It is crafted of mine own hands,\u201d Dori says, sounding aggravated.\nBilbo grabs for it, heaves it over his shoulders and burrows under the warmth. It is made of thick cloth, and though it dampens almost immediately under the light sprinkle, it is hardy enough to add some warmth and protection. At the very least, it keeps the rain out of his eyes and for that alone, Bilbo could\u2019ve kissed Dori.\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d he says. \u201cI finally do not have water in my eyes\u2014Yavanna, it is a feckin\u2019 miracle.\u201d\nDori\u2019s gone very still. \u201cYou like it, then?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt is warm enough?\u201d He sounds oddly insistent.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cI mean, I would\u2019ve been happy with a scrap of blanket, but this is much warmer and thicker and also, as far as I can see, a lovely green so thank you very much, Master Dori.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you approve of this gift,\u201d Dori says and the grumpiness melts from him. \u201cBut you must promise not to catch cold, Bilbo, and it is only Dori\u2014no need for titles among friends, no matter how odd hobbits are.\u201d\nHe starts to stomp back to his brothers as Bilbo gapes at him, but turns midway and comes back.\n\u201cAnd you must not sleep here,\u201d Dori says crossly. \u201cCome, come. The wizard obviously is no use at all, don\u2019t know why His Majesty brought him along, but you\u2019ll freeze to your death without anybody to huddle with, come on\u2014\u201c\nDori herds Bilbo and his bedroll to the little circle his brothers have made and plops him right in the middle. Ori is already asleep and barely shuffles as Bilbo is planted at his side, but Nori slits an eye open and grins.\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s adopted another one, has he?\u201d he says. \u201cWell at least you\u2019re pretty, Master Baggins.\u201d\u00a0\nBilbo gapes at him and Dori swats at his head. \u201cNone of that, brother,\u201d he says. \u201cBilbo is here for warmth and I won\u2019t have you leering at him as he sleeps.\u201d\nBoth of Nori\u2019s eyes open at that. \u201cBilbo, is it?\u201d he asks. \u201cAh, the cloak, of course. Soon enough you\u2019ll have an entire set, Master Baggins.\u201d He winks for good measure and Bilbo sputters.\n\u201cI beg your pardon\u2014\u201c\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Dori orders Nori as he bunkers down on Bilbo\u2019s other side. To his bemusement, he is boxed in by dwarrows. \u201cYou too, Bilbo,\u201d Dori says and Bilbo sighs deeply before he closes his eyes.\u00a0\nWell. It\u2019s warmer, at least.\n\nK\u00edli\n\nBilbo has a moment when he\u2019s being used, in an ironic twist of fate, as a handkerchief by a troll, where he realizes that he\u2019s come on this adventure with a bunch of utterly incompetent madcap idiots. It would be nice to say that he\u2019d been proven wrong by them coming to his rescue, but considering his numpty companions fluffed it up so bad that Bilbo had to be the one to cobble together some sort of plan until Gandalf got to them\u2014well.\u00a0\nNow he knows why they invited him along\u2014because they\u2019re all complete morons. He should\u2019ve realized the moment Thorin said he got lost in Hobbiton, the place with one road.\nHe fumes in front of the troll hoard and tries not to think about the way he smells or looks right now. He aches all down his back from being flung at a dwarf and his joints are tender from being pulled so hard by an angry troll. All he wants, more than anything, is a nice bath and a warm bed, but he they still have miles of traveling to do before they can camp and it\u2019ll be the hard ground once more.\nBilbo\u2019s determined to convince Thorin to go to Rivendell if only so that they can stop camping on the gorram ground for once. He doesn\u2019t care if Thorin hates elves.\nA hand lands on his shoulder and he groans.\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay, Master Baggins?\u201d K\u00edli asks, leaning down to look him in the face. His nose wrinkles, but he must have more common sense than Mahal gave the common dwarf, for he says nothing about it. \u201cYou aren\u2019t hurt, are you?\u201d\nBilbo glowers at him. \u201cHoot once like a barn owl?\u201d he asks acidly.\nK\u00edli winces again. \u201cAh,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, that was a stupid rescue plan, I guess. But we came out of it all right!\u201d\n\u201cYou came out of it all right!\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cYou and your numpty brother! I came out of it covered in troll boogies and bruises from an impromptu game of hobbit-dwarf conkers!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cOh, never mind!\u201d Bilbo snaps. \u201cThe point is, I\u2019m never listening to you two ever again! Of all the brainless, foolhardy things to convince me to do\u2014!\u201d\nK\u00edli\u2019s grinning a little and Bilbo never thought there would be a dwarf he\u2019d want to clobber more than Thorin. Perhaps it runs in the family?\n\u201cYou did it though, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. \u201cWent right in and got those ponies out, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nBilbo frowns. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says, nonplussed.\u00a0\n\u201cHelped get us out of that tight spot too,\u201d K\u00edli says. \u201cEven if you did say we have parasites.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for taking so long to catch on, by the way,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cIf you\u2019d spent one more minute screaming about how you didn\u2019t have them, the trolls might\u2019ve caught on, thick as they are!\u201d\n\u201cYou can thank Thorin for that,\u201d K\u00edli says. \u201cHe caught on to what you were doing before the rest of us did. Gave me a right ol\u2019 kick to shut me up.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s eyebrows lift in surprise and he spares a glance at the dank hole that Thorin and Gandalf have disappeared into\u2014he figured someone must\u2019ve caught a clue, but to think it was Thorin Oakenshield! The Valar must have been feeling kind to Bilbo indeed to give that empty-headed fool a bit of cunning!\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d K\u00edli says, \u201cyou\u2019re an alright sort for a hobbit, Master Baggins. And you got us all out of a right old mess and you went along with me and Fee even though you didn\u2019t want to. So.\u201d He fishes around for a moment in his jacket and pulls out a small silver box engraved with the odd runes that Ori writes in\u2014Khuzdul. He opens it and plucks something out, offering it to Bilbo. \u201cIt is crafted of mine own hands,\u201d he says, smiling.\nBilbo takes it and gasps. Hobbits don\u2019t wear much in the way of jewelry\u2014wedding rings being the exception, or nice earrings if someone\u2019s inclined\u2014but even he can tell that the necklace is a work of art. The chain is delicately wrought and the dwarrows must be rubbing off on him, for Bilbo can tell that it is silver immediately. It is studded with tiny sapphires the size of Bilbo\u2019s pinky nail, all, as he sees when he looks closer, engraved with tiny runes. The sapphire at the heart of the necklace has a tiny emblem of crossed axes under a crown with seven stars embedded in it. It is a beautiful thing that must have required a delicate touch\u2014Bilbo couldn\u2019t even conceive of hammy, rough-handed K\u00edli making something like this!\n\u201cIt\u2014it is beautiful, K\u00edli,\u201d he says.\nK\u00edli blinks at him, then beams, the largest smile Bilbo\u2019s ever seen him wear. He remembers, suddenly, that K\u00edli is considered young even by dwarf standards\u2014barely older than Ori, who\u2019s just out of his tweens himself. And though Bilbo can\u2019t speak for K\u00edli\u2019s parents, he does have a stern uncle who told him not a few weeks ago that he knew nothing of the world.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen its like,\u201d Bilbo continues on warmly. \u201cBut surely it is too lovely to give to me?\u201d\nK\u00edli\u2019s expression dims. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t offer you what you deserve?\u201d he asks, puzzled and, strangely enough, hurt. \u201cYou think I care so little for your friendship?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Of course not!\u201d Bilbo reaches out and takes K\u00edli\u2019s hand. \u201cYou came back to save me from the trolls, didn\u2019t you? It\u2019s only\u2014well, wouldn\u2019t it be better to sell it for funds? For the journey?\u201d\nK\u00edli relaxes. \u201cOh. No, that necklace is not one I could sell\u2014Uncle would murder me if I gave it to a Man or, Mahal forbid, an Elf!\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the Khuzdul?\u201d Bilbo guesses and K\u00edli grins at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a right clever hobbit, Bilbo,\u201d he says and slings an arm over Bilbo\u2019s shoulder. His nose wrinkles. \u201cEven if you do smell.\u201d\nBilbo glares up at him. \u201cAnd whose fault is that\u2014?!\u201d\n\u201cWell, your own,\u201d K\u00edli says, his voice pragmatic even as his eyes dance. \u201cAfter all, if you had been a better burglar, you wouldn\u2019t have been caught! You\u2019ll need to practice before we get to the Mountain, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cIf you continue to pester me, you won\u2019t have to worry about me going to the mountain at all,\u201d he says. His eye is drawn back to the necklace. \u201cWhat do all these runes mean, anyhow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014well, I don\u2019t suppose I can tell you what it says, but it\u2019s like a prayer. It\u2019s what Mahal said to Durin to wake him from his long sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that story,\u201d Bilbo says, frowning. Everyone knows Aul\u00eb created the dwarrows, but anything beyond that has been kept very secret.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about Durin!\u201d K\u00edli says, aghast. \u201cWhat do they teach you hobbits? Come on, we can go talk to Ori, it\u2019s a ripping good story\u2014!\u201d\nThorin steps out of the hoard, cutting K\u00edli off. He\u2019s covered in dust and there\u2019s a furrow to his brow that means he\u2019ll spend the night around the campfire brooding, but he\u2019s holding a sword that gleams even through the dirt, so the foraging couldn\u2019t have all been a waste. He casts a glance at K\u00edli, then catches sight of the necklace in Bilbo\u2019s hands. For a moment, his expression tightens, but Bilbo can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s fury or surprise.\n\u201cPack up,\u201d he says after a long moment. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nHe sweeps past them. It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s halfway across the clearing that Bilbo lets out a long sigh and turns back to K\u00edli, who looks gobsmacked.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with this, but thank you,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cEven if you are a empty-headed numpty who\u2019s terrible at rescue plans.\u201d\nK\u00edli smiles at him, so wide and fond and terribly happy that Bilbo suddenly aches with affection for him. He\u2019s so young, Bilbo thinks.\u00a0\n\u201cI am glad you approve of this gift,\u201d K\u00edli says. He grabs at Bilbo\u2019s elbow and pulls him away. \u201cNow come on, we must speak to Ori immediately\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u00d3in\n\nThey\u2019ve not been in Rivendell for more than an hour before there\u2019s a hard knock against Bilbo\u2019s door. Bilbo opens it, bemused, and finds \u00d3in on the other side, scowling and re-adjusting his ear trumpet.\n\u201cK\u00edli says you\u2019ve got bruises,\u201d he says, blustering in through the door and stomping to Bilbo\u2019s bed. He\u2019s got a little sack under one arm. \u201cSit down and let me look at ye.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s sitting before he realizes what he\u2019s doing. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says automatically as \u00d3in runs a critical gaze over him. \u201cNothing wrong with me at all.\u201d\n\u00d3in gives him a long look and then pokes him, hard, right in the middle of the purpling bruise over his ribs. Bilbo shouts and spasms in on himself, shooting \u00d3in a look of utter betrayal. \u00d3in just snorts and opens his sack.\n\u201cFine my well-toned behind,\u201d he mutters. For \u00d3in, a mutter is more like a mild shout, but Bilbo covers his laugh with a cough. \u201cTake off your shirt, laddie.\u201d\nBilbo blushes. \u201cIs this really\u2014\u201c\n\u201cYour. Shirt.\u201d\nHe grumbles, but shucks off the nasty-smelling waistcoat and linen shirt underneath. No great loss to have those off, but he still feels exposed as \u00d3in looks him over. Bilbo hasn\u2019t often been naked with other people since he was a young lad, and even if \u00d3in is older than dirt and a healer besides, it\u2019s uncomfortable. He\u2019s lost a stone since the start of the journey, but he\u2019s still quite . . . round compared to the rest of the Company and before now, he\u2019s done his best to not get naked in front of any of them and expose himself to ridicule.\nNot that he\u2019d say no if some of the dwarrows got it in their head to take a look at him half-naked, but Bilbo\u2019s doing his best not to think too much about that. Down that road lies madness and broken hearts and all that.\n\u00d3in pulls out an odd little jar that unscrews on the top like a jam jar. Inside is a sweet-smelling paste that he smears some on his fingers. \u00d3in moves to put it on Bilbo, but pauses just as his fingers are about to touch skin.\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s right,\u201d he says, though Bilbo has no idea who he might be speaking to. \u201cThis is crafted of mine own hands,\u201d he tells Bilbo, and proceeds to rub it all over the bruise.\nBilbo squirms away from the touch\u2014the paste is icy and then hot, as if he\u2019s been plunged into freezing and then boiling water, but after a moment it does begin to soothe his muscles. Bilbo relaxes, bit by bit, as the ache he\u2019s suffered from since the trolls begins to fade.\n\u201cAny other pains, laddie?\u201d \u00d3in asks. Bilbo scrunches his nose and \u00d3in rolls his eyes. \u201cJust tell me, Bilbo,\u201d he says. \u201cSooner said, sooner this is all done and you can go and get yourself a bath.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t smell that bad,\u201d Bilbo says, cross.\n\u201cWell, without your shirt it is a wee bit better,\u201d \u00d3in admits. \u201cBut you\u2019ve still got troll gunk in your hair and my sense of smell got keener when my hearing went, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cThe troll pulled my joints a bit when he was throwing me about\u2014think he might have done something to my shoulder.\u201d\nBilbo relaxes a little as \u00d3in examines the joint and deems him fit enough, dabbing another paste on the bruise collecting there as insurance. It isn\u2019t until \u00d3in\u2019s already left and he\u2019s sinking into a much needed, much appreciated bath that he realizes that \u00d3in gave him his own healing pastes and Bilbo didn\u2019t even so much as say thank you. Spend enough time with dwarrows and you pick up their manners!\nAfter the bath, he thinks and sinks in to his chin with a happy sigh.\u00a0\n\nNori\n\nRivendell is so lovely that Bilbo aches just at the thought of leaving it; even the draw of the Shire is lesser here, surrounded by the quiet and the beauty. He thinks he will ask Lord Elrond if they might have a place for a small hobbit sometime in the future\u2014he wants to go back to Bag End, but he can\u2019t say that Rivendell wouldn\u2019t be a good place to live once he got older and frailer. A place to finish the book he\u2019s half-thinking about writing once this is all done. His father always told him that all good adventures had to be written down.\nHe sits on a bench by the main gardens and smokes the pipe Balin gave him, content for the first time in weeks; so content that he fails to hear Nori approach until the dwarf plops down next to him.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hard fellow to find, Master Baggins,\u201d Nori says.\nBilbo lets go a smoke ring. \u201cIf any of you knew anything about hobbits at all,\u201d he says, too relaxed to be irritated, \u201cyou would\u2019ve known this would be the first place to look for me.\u201d\nNori smirks. \u201cI do know something of hobbits,\u201d he says. \u201cI checked the kitchens first.\u201d\nBilbo laughs. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Master Nori?\u201d\nNori, for the first time Bilbo\u2019s known him, goes oddly tense. Nori, like Bofur, is one of the few dwarrows in the Company who seems content in their own skin\u2014loose, easy, prone to jokes or innuendo or song. Bilbo\u2019s never seen Nori look discomforted before.\n\u201cI know it is not right,\u201d Nori says. \u201cI know it is not the proper way. But I thought to give you a gift anyway, Master Baggins, if you would accept it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMaster Nori, what\u2014\u201c\nNori pulls something from his jacket and offers to Bilbo. He takes it, nonplussed, and raises his eyebrows when he sees the tiny pin in his hand. It is cleverly made and probably silver, but Bilbo has no doubt it was made by the elves\u2014a bright green leaf would never probably occur to dwarrows. It has a clever pin on the back and Bilbo realizes it must be for a cloak. In fact, the leaf matches the color of the cloak Dori gave him almost exactly.\n\u201cI wish I could say it is crafted of mine own hands,\u201d Nori says, a bitter twist to his mouth. \u201cBut it was taken with them, so perhaps that can count.\u201d\n\u201cYou stole this?\u201d Bilbo says, aghast. \u201cFrom who!?\u201d\nNori gets a little sly, shifty look in his eyes. \u201cYou know Lord Elrond\u2019s twin sons?\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Bilbo says, looking down at the little pilfered pin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get into so much trouble!\u201d\n\u201cI can take it back,\u201d Nori says, brusquely enough, but his voice trembles just a little bit and he\u2019s turning away from Bilbo now, as if unable to face him. \u201cI know it\u2019s not a real gift, not the kind you deserve, but\u2014\u201c\nWell. Enough is enough.\n\u201cNori,\u201d Bilbo says and ignores the way Nori\u2019s head snaps back around, eyes gone wide. \u201cWhat is it with you dwarrows and all this gift business?\u201d\nNori looks entirely flummoxed. \u201cYou mean you\u2014you don\u2019t know?\u201d\nBilbo throws his hands up in the air, though he\u2019s careful to keep hold of the pin. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t know! Hobbits don\u2019t do any of this gift-giving foolishness; if we want to be friends with someone, we just ask them or spend time together or what have you!\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nori says, nonplussed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s awfully odd, isn\u2019t it? How can you tell if they truly care for you if they don\u2019t give their craft, Master Baggins?\u201d\nBilbo pokes him in the chest. \u201cIt\u2019s Bilbo,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t they be my friend, even if they don\u2019t give me a gift?\u201d\nNori pauses, thinking it over. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know,\u201d\u00a0 he says, wonderingly. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you said anything?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to be rude,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cSeemed a bit disrespectful to ask questions when I was given such lovely things.\u201d\nNori begins to laugh. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to be beyond themselves when they find out,\u201d he says, wheezing a little. \u201cBalin\u2019s already gifted you and he didn\u2019t know! Oh, I can\u2019t wait to see his face\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cNori,\u201d Bilbo says, impatient now. \u201cExplain it to me!\u201d\n\u201cOh, oh, of course,\u201d Nori says, settling a little bit more firmly on their bench. \u201cWell, I suppose you could say craft has a special place for dwarrows. Mahal crafted the first dwarrows from rock, y\u2019see, and then passed on that gift for craft to us, to make us the superior race.\u201d Bilbo rolls his eyes, but Nori doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cSo we take it seriously. The only other ceremony for dwarrows other than Coming-of-Age and marriage is when they choose the craft they will pursue through adulthood.\u201d\nBilbo thinks on this for a moment. \u201cCan it be anything?\u201d he asks. \u201cBombur gave me a cake for his gift\u2014so your craft can be baking?\u201d\n\u201cWe believe that as long as it has been created from nothing or re-shapes something ordinary or dull or useless, then it can be called craft,\u201d Nori says. \u201cBombur\u2019s a bit unusual\u2014most dwarrows do something with metal-smithing or jewelry, as you\u2019ve seen with young K\u00edli. Ori\u2019s a scribe, so he\u2019s all about creating books. Balin does pipes, usually from stone\u2014though I heard he made one from mithril for the last King. But the point is the art of creation\u2014so I suppose by your view, it can be anything.\u201d\nBilbo absorbs this. \u201cSo why do you need to give gifts upon friendship?\u201d\n\u201cIt shows honor for your new bond,\u201d Nori says. \u201cWhat we craft is who we are\u2014when Bombur gave you his cake and Balin a pipe or Dori his cloak\u2014they\u2019re giving you little pieces of themselves, to show that they trust you to hold it and that they believe you worthy of them.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd to show that you are precious to them as well. We consider it an insult if you give a craft to a loved one that is not well-made, as the quality of the gift is a reflection of how well you feel to the gifted.\u201d\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Bilbo says, a little overwhelmed. \u201cTo think, I just thought they were being nice!\u201d\nNori laughs. \u201cWe give gifts to honor our close connections, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. \u201cTo friends or family and to our Ones. They are a sign of our affection.\u201d\nBilbo, though, is caught on Nori\u2019s insistence on using his title, and remembers what brought this about to begin with.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think your gift counts to me, Nori?\u201d he asks, as gently as he can.\nNori examines Bilbo\u2019s face for a long moment\u2014whatever he\u2019s looking for, he must find, for he gives a long, resigned sigh.\n\u201cExamine my hands, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. He holds them out for review.\nBilbo takes them in, brow furrowed. What on Earth\u2014? But then he sees it. If they hadn\u2019t just talked about craft, perhaps Bilbo wouldn\u2019t have made the connection, but the hands in front of him are different from the other dwarrows. Nori has long, elegant fingers, a length and width that Bilbo\u2019s seen on elves but never on a dwarf.\u00a0\n\u201cElf-hands,\u201d Nori says quietly. \u201cMy hands are not made for creation, Master Baggins. I\u2019ve tried almost all, but I can never quite get the hang of it. Not enough to declare a mastery, anyway.\u201d He\u2019s blushing now, as if ashamed, and that\u2019s startling enough to make Bilbo reach out and take one of those hands in his. Nori blinks at him and smiles a little. \u201cDwarrows who cannot create are\u2014\u201c He frowns and says a word in Khuzdul. \u201cUnblessed, outcast; I suppose cursed would be the closest connotation in Westron, Master Baggins.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCursed!\u201d Bilbo repeats, startled.\u00a0\n\u201cAye, cursed. What good is a dwarf who is born without the gift Mahal gave us?\u201d Nori sounds so bitter, as if he\u2019s been told this so many times in his life. \u201cWhat sets a dwarf apart when he cannot use the gift of his Maker?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Nori\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI wish you would not call me that,\u201d Nori mutters. \u201cIt was a foolish idea, to give you that pin and it is not a true gift, not at all.\u201d\nBilbo reaches out and, hesitant because he knows now how dwarrows are about their hair, touches one of the points of Nori\u2019s braids. Nori\u2019s head snaps up and Bilbo holds his gaze.\n\u201cFor Hobbits,\u201d he says, \u201cfriendship happens when we feel true affection for each other. I like you, Nori, for you are sly and charming and you know a great deal of good drinking songs, which any Hobbit can appreciate. At the very least, you are brave or mad enough to come on this journey, and you obviously love your brothers. I do not care if your hands were not made for craft\u2014Mahal must have known what he was doing, for he gave you a thief\u2019s hands and you have done good work with them.\u201d\nHe pins the little leaf to his shirt under Nori\u2019s disbelieving eye.\u00a0\n\u201cI will take this gift and honor it as I have all the others,\u201d he says. \u201cFor you gave it to me and that makes its precious.\u201d He stops and considers for a moment. \u201cBesides, what other hobbit can say he wears an elf-lord\u2019s cloak pin?\u201d\nNori chokes out a laugh. \u201cYou are a most surprising creature,\u201d he says finally. He stares at the pin on Bilbo\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou like it?\u201d he asks, so shy that it might be Ori sitting in front of Bilbo instead. \u201cFor true?\u201d\nBilbo wonders how long its been since Nori was able to give a gift to anyone\u2014has he never do so? Or, even worse, did he try and get rejected by other dwarrows?\u00a0\n\u201cI love it,\u201d he says. \u201cThough how I\u2019ll explain it to Lord Elrond, I dread to think.\u201d\nNori laughs and, to Bilbo\u2019s surprise, draws him into a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you from the weed-eaters, Bilbo,\u201d he says into Bilbo\u2019s ear and Bilbo smiles, leaning into the shoulder offered to him.\n\u00a0\n\nBofur\n\nBilbo doesn\u2019t look at any of them as they march into the cave after the close call with the Stone Giants\u2014he can\u2019t bear to meet any of their eyes, even the ones who have already proved their friendships in gifts. He\u2019s never felt small before on this adventure; out of his depth, yes, and sometimes a little useless, perhaps\u2014but this is the first time that Thorin has ever made him feel utterly worthless.\nIt\u2019s the only time Thorin has ever told him to go home; even when Thorin was grumbling and grumpy and glaring at him, he never told Bilbo to go home before. He curls up in the cloak Dori gifted him on the edge of the group and continues to ignore them all. He feels eyes on him, but the Company respects his mood and leaves him be.\nFor the most part.\u00a0\nBilbo\u2019s half-asleep when he feels the gentle press of a hand on his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cYou awake?\u201d Bofur asks, squatting down to sit beside him.\n\u201cWould it matter if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d Bilbo asks, cross and not trying to hide it.\nBofur smiles at him and draws out his pipe. Bilbo can tell now that it is one of Balin\u2019s and wonders if it was given as a gift. He can usually tell if one of the dwarrows have given gifts, for they drop the titles almost immediately, but he\u2019s never noticed that between Bofur and Balin\u2014perhaps Bofur bought one from him instead?\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve come over here to talk to me about Thorin\u2014\u201c Bilbo starts.\n\u201cD\u2019you know that my brother and I have never seen Erebor?\u201d Bofur says.\nBilbo frowns. \u201cI thought you all were born there!\u201d he says. \u201cYou mean you and Bombur weren\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cBifur was just a wee dwarfling when the dragon came\u2014he can\u2019t remember the mountain at all.\u201d\nBilbo stares at him, astonished. \u201cAnd yet you came on this madcap trip?\u201d\nBofur smiles. \u201cWhen you say it like that, it sound stupid,\u201d he says. He takes a long drag of his pipe and flutters out a smoke ring. In the darkness, it is pale, ashy, eerie. \u201cBifur was with Master Thorin at Azanulbizar,\u201d he says. \u201cThe battle where King Thrain was lost. That\u2019s where his,\u201d he makes a little motion toward his head, \u201chappened. And we would have had a dead body instead of a cousin if Master Thorin had not insisted he have the best healers\u2014Bifur was wounded protecting the Prince, y\u2019see, even if he didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d\n\u201cThe Prince?\u201d Bilbo says, confused.\u00a0\n\u201cMaster Thorin\u2019s younger brother,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cFrerin. He died in that battle as well.\u201d\nBugger. Every time Bilbo thinks he can hate Thorin with impunity someone has to come and remind him that Bilbo\u2019s never met anyone with a more tragic past. Damn the dwarf.\n\u201cBifur and Bombur\u2014well, they\u2019re all I have left,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cSo when Master Thorin saved Bifur, I promised him our family\u2019s allegiance.\u201d He blows out another smoke ring. \u201cAye, we\u2019ll follow him to that mountain\u2014and to any other mountain he sets his sights on.\u201d\n\u201cHe wishes me to go,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him? And what\u2019s even worse is that\u2014is that he\u2019s right. What have I done for you all besides keep you from getting killed by the trolls? And even that wouldn\u2019t have happened if it weren\u2019t for my damnable clumsiness\u2014\u201c\n\u201cMaster Thorin has a problem,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cHe has never had a good rapport with outsiders and he doesn\u2019t like strangers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been traveling with you for weeks,\u201d Bilbo says, indignant. \u201cAnd yet he still considers me a stranger!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a dwarf, Master Baggins,\u201d Bofur says, raising his eyebrows.\n\u201cYes, well!\u201d Bilbo blusters. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I couldn\u2019t be born to the \u2018superior race\u2019 but I don\u2019t see what I can do about it! And I\u2019ll have you know that Hobbits were given to this world by Aul\u00eb\u2019s wife, so I\u2019m the closest non-dwarf dwarf you fellows are ever going to get! And frankly, considering how ridiculous and temperamental and stubborn you lot are, all I can say is I\u2019m thankful that I was born a sensible hobbit instead!\u201d\u00a0\nBofur stares at him\u2014hell, half of the dwarrows are staring at him now, for his voice had climbed considerably as he spoke. Bilbo flushes to the tips of his ears, but glares back at them. Some of them, like Thorin and Dwalin, turn away without expression, but Balin winks at him and Ori and Nori grin.\u00a0\n\u201cAch, calm down,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cYou\u2019re such an excitable little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He reaches out and presses a hand to Bilbo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI just wanted you to get a better sense of him, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s an honorable dwarf and he\u2019s had much to give him cause to doubt others. He doesn\u2019t mean what he says to you\u2014and even if he does, well, isn\u2019t it better to stay and prove him wrong?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a hard time,\u201d Bilbo says, fierce still, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to sit around and excuse the way he treats me. I\u2019m not his enemy and I\u2019ve come on this godforsaken quest to get his gorram homeland back. I don\u2019t want gratitude, but I could do with tolerance at the very least!\u201d\nBofur grins. \u201cI expect that if he doesn\u2019t find his manners soon, you\u2019ll bully some into him.\u201d He reaches into his jacket with his free hand and offers something to Bilbo. \u201cHere. I would\u2019ve given it to you sooner, but\u2014well, let\u2019s say Thorin isn\u2019t the only who\u2019s slow to trust around here, aye?\u201d\nBilbo takes it and stares down at the tiny ruby dragon. It is curled up like a sleeping cat, its eyes shut, and it is half the size of Bilbo\u2019s palm, but every scale is intricately engraved. He\u2019s never seen anything like it.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cOh my.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to faint again, are you?\u201d Bofur asks. He\u2019s grinning, but Bilbo notices that he has a tight grip on his pipe. \u201cIt is crafted from mine own hands, Master Baggins.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Bilbo,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cAnd I find that I no longer have the desire to faint at the thought of dragons.\u201d\nBofur takes a long drag off his pipe. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief, I have to say. Would\u2019ve been a right pickle for us if you got all the way into Erebor and fainted at the crucial moment.\u201d\nBilbo takes one last look at the tiny carving before he tucks it carefully away in his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d he says, because he knows that\u2019s what Bofur really wants to ask him. \u201cBut I won\u2019t take Master Thorin\u2019s disdain for much longer.\u201d\nBofur\u2019s grin is wide and warm. \u201cOh, I never thought you would, laddie.\u201d\n\nDwalin\n\nThey all dread the long walk down the Carrock, so they set up camp on the top of the mountain for the night. Bilbo finds himself enfolded amongst the \u2018Ri brothers. They had all been pale when Bilbo found them and Dori had grabbed him and pulled him into a tight hug. Bilbo had been surprised when Nori had taken him immediately afterward and knocked their foreheads together as he had seen Balin and Dwalin do, though much more gently.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that again,\u201d Nori had said. \u201cYou are the only one outside my family to accept my gift, Bilbo\u2014you\u2019re not allowed to die, d\u2019you understand?\u201d\nBilbo probably shouldn\u2019t have felt so warm at that; he had made people who cared about him quite worried indeed, and that wasn\u2019t a thing to feel glad over. But he did appreciate Nori\u2019s worry, for he knew that it spoke of his affection\u2014and Bilbo found that he had been without it so long that he was cherishing it even more upon its reappearance in his life.\u00a0\nAll his other friends had come to check on him personally as well\u2014K\u00edli came to run a hand over him and give a hard bop to the forehead, Balin with a personal thanks and a shoulder squeeze, Bombur and Bofur with tight hugs . . . . Between their obvious relief at his wellbeing and Thorin\u2019s acknowledgement, the memory of being told to go home on that cliff was very nearly gone. Despite their close call, Bilbo feels more content than he has in days.\nHe\u2019s nearly asleep when there\u2019s movement outside their little circle\u2014he looks up to see Dwalin, of all people, standing over him. When he sees Bilbo looking, he indicates with his head that Bilbo should follow him. Tired, but curious, Bilbo carefully extracts himself from his little circle and follows Dwalin to the edge of camp. They stand for a moment and watch the fire.\n\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Bilbo asks, concerned now.\nHe and Dwalin have never much spoken together\u2014indeed, Dwalin doesn\u2019t speak to many outside his brother and Thorin. But Bilbo can\u2019t deny there\u2019s something comforting about Dwalin; it\u2019s hard to feel unsafe when there\u2019s a dwarf nearby who\u2019s nearly a head taller than you and twice as wide wielding two wicked-looking axes.\u00a0\n\u201cYou saved my king today,\u201d Dwalin says, voice a low rumble. \u201cWhen I was too slow to make it to him in time.\u201d\nUnbelievably, Bilbo\u2019s ears warm. \u201cAh. Well. Any of you would\u2019ve done the same.\u201d\nDwalin shakes his head. \u201cAye, we would\u2019ve. But you\u2019re the only one who could. And you have no obligation to him or to us, especially after what he said to you in the mountains.\u201d\nThis is more than Bilbo\u2019s ever heard Dwalin say before. \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t just let him die, could I?\u201d\nDwalin gives him a long look. \u201cI\u2019ve misjudged you very badly, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. He takes something off his belt and holds it out to Bilbo. \u201cIt is crafted with mine own hands.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s so surprised to get a gift from Dwalin that he fumbles for a moment with it before he can get a good look. It\u2019s a small axe\u2014next to Dwalin\u2019s, it looks like it\u2019s made for a child, but it\u2019s much heavier than it looks. The edge is inscribed with runes and the guard is of some sort of black wood that gleams, even in the dim firelight. It has a ruby set in the end the size of Bilbo\u2019s thumbnail.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to use this,\u201d Bilbo tells Dwalin. He hefts it up and grimaces. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can use this.\u201d\nDwalin grins. It makes his face much less grim. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you, laddie,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, if you\u2019re going to be fool enough to charge orcs and face down the Berserker, you\u2019d best have more weapons on you than that little kitchen knife.\u201d\nBilbo puffs up. \u201cI stabbed an orc with that knife!\u201d he protests.\u00a0\n\u201cAye, you did,\u201d Dwalin says. \u201cBut let\u2019s not pretend that wasn\u2019t pure luck and surprise, Bilbo.\u201d\nBilbo blinks, caught off-guard. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this out of some sort of\u2014obligation,\u201d he says.\nDwalin frowns. \u201cObligation?\u201d he asks, and he sounds angry, for some reason. \u201cYou think I would give away my craft for something so petty?\u201d\n\u201cWell, how do I know?\u201d Bilbo asks, cross now. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who was talking about how I saved Thorin right before you gave me an axe!\u201d\u00a0\nDwalin\u2019s beard twitches, but Bilbo can\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny. \u201cThorin?\u201d he asks.\u00a0\nBilbo ignores the stupid question. \u201cI just don\u2019t want this to be some sort of odd thank you!\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t save him to get any sort of prize or reward!\u201d\n\u201cI am glad to hear it, Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo squeaks and turns on his heel to find Thorin staring down at him from the fire, though Bilbo could have sworn everyone else was already asleep, Thorin included. Bilbo frowns and takes Thorin in\u2014ragged around the edges, bags under his eyes, pale as a new moon and trembling like a scared fauntling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep,\u201d he says crossly. \u201cYou just got gnawed on by a warg, or did you forget?\u201d\nThorin scowls. \u201cI am perfectly well,\u201d he says.\n\u201cListen to the hobbit,\u201d Dwalin says, unexpectedly backing Bilbo up. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch until morning.\u201d\nBilbo rounds on him. \u201cYou are going to sleep as well!\u201d he says, giving Dwalin the threatening finger that had subdued many a small relative back home. \u201cYou haven\u2019t slept in days!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJust two,\u201d Dwalin says, unaffected by the finger. Blasted dwarf. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\nBilbo resists the urge to stomp his foot. \u201cYou\u2019ll both sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch. After all, I am now properly equipped, thanks to you.\u201d He raises the axe meaningfully.\u00a0\n\u201cDwalin\u2019s gifted you?\u201d Thorin asks, and he sounds so incredulous that Bilbo rounds on him with ferocity.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, he has!\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lovely gift too! Why, look at those engravings! Look at the sharpness of that edge! Look at the size and cut of that ruby! I could not ask for a better gift or a more thoughtful one, considering I doubt this is the last time we\u2019ll be facing orcs, nor the last time I will have to save your royal behind!\u201d\u00a0\nThorin\u2019s eyebrows are almost to his hairline, jaw soft with surprise. It\u2019s the most flummoxed Bilbo\u2019s ever seen him, so he turns back to Dwalin with satisfaction. Dwalin, though, is staring at him too\u2014and there\u2019s a flush climbing steadily from his cheeks to the bald dome of his head. Bilbo stifles a smile and tries to look stern.\n\u201cYou go to your bedroll and sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch and then\u2014why, and then I\u2019ll see if F\u00edli or K\u00edli will sit after. They\u2019re both young enough to bounce back from this sort of thing.\u201d\nDwalin\u2019s blush doesn\u2019t really fade. Bilbo\u2019s not even sure Dwalin heard him.\n\u201cYou really do like it?\u201d he asks, a most un-Dwalin-ish question.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cAlthough I really don\u2019t know how to use it, so I doubt I\u2019ll give it the kind of care it deserves.\u201d\nDwalin looks over Bilbo\u2019s shoulder and whatever he sees there makes him smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you, as I said,\u201d he says and presses in close to give Bilbo the gentlest forehead touch he\u2019s had yet. \u201cAnd you do have my thanks,\u201d he says when they\u2019re sharing space. \u201cWhether you want it or not.\u201d\nHe leaves before Bilbo can say anything and Bilbo shakes his head. Dwarrows are confoundedly confusing sometimes.\n\u201cYou are becoming something of a collector, Master Baggins,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cIs that half the company now, or more?\u201d\n\u201cMore,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business who I befriend.\u201d He looks at Thorin and sighs. \u201cYou really should rest,\u201d he says, going over to him. \u201cYou nearly died not a few hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cI am not so easy to kill, Master Baggins.\u201d\n\u201cYou would\u2019ve been killed, if not for me,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cSo I\u2019d say you most certainly can die easier than you think.\u201d\nThorin glares at him. \u201cI am not so weak, to be ordered to bed like a child,\u201d he says.\nBilbo leans up into him, going on his tiptoes so that he and Thorin share breathing space. Thorin\u2019s eyes go wide\u2014Bilbo wonders if anyone\u2019s had the guts to get in his face like this before. Perhaps not. Perhaps Bilbo would not have the guts if he were not so tired and fed up.\n\u201cI saved your life,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you dare waste it, if you dare squander it, I will be most unhappy, Master Oakenshield.\u201d\nThorin doesn\u2019t speak for a long moment, holding Bilbo\u2019s gaze. Then he gives a short nod and Bilbo moves away. He\u2019s a little embarrassed at invading Thorin\u2019s space like that, but pleased that it at least got him some results. He had hoped that dwarfish honor would keep Thorin in line. He doesn\u2019t want to ever see Thorin on the ground again, bleeding and hurt.\n\u201cGo sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you if there\u2019s trouble.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s still staring at him like he\u2019s never seen Bilbo before. \u201cI must apologize again, Master Baggins,\u201d he says as he finally turns away. \u201cI have never misjudged a person so tremendously before in my life.\u201d\nBilbo smiles at his retreating back. If the rest of their journey is like this, he finds that he does not mind the danger so much.\n\nF\u00edli\n\nBilbo wakes up warm and content for the first time in what feels like an age. It\u2019s still dark inside Beorn\u2019s and he can hear Bombur and Dwalin snoring, but his bladder is pressing him, so Bilbo gets up instead of drifting back off again to use one of the discrete chamber pots. He\u2019s so sleepy that he doesn\u2019t notice the figure by the fire until he\u2019s nearly back to his bedding. He hesitates, torn, but sighs when he sees that the figure is F\u00edli and that the set of his face by firelight is long indeed.\u00a0\nDamn these dwarrows.\nHe grabs his blanket and throws it over his shoulders like a fauntling playing dress up before he waddles over and sits down at F\u00edli\u2019s side. F\u00edli jumps when Bilbo appears, but he smiles a little.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone else was awake, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it past bedtime for little hobbits?\u201d\nBilbo scowls at him. \u201cI am your elder, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if I\u2019ll never be taller or\u2014well, more muscular than you.\u201d\nF\u00edli\u2019s grin widens. \u201cAye, that\u2019s true.\u201d He pokes the area Bilbo\u2019s belly would be if his body wasn\u2019t swaddled by cloth. \u201cYou do run a little softer, Master Baggins.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t take cheek from you, Master F\u00edli,\u201d Bilbo says severely, swatting away the offending finger. \u201cNow\u2014tell me why you are not taking full advantage of being relatively dry and safe to sleep peacefully instead of brooding by the fire?\u201d He makes a face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re trying to be like your uncle. Didn\u2019t anyone tell you that that much brooding isn\u2019t good for the body?\u201d\nF\u00edli laughs. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not trying to copy Uncle Thorin,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever reach his level anyway.\u201d F\u00edli sobers a little. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot more to brood about, after all.\u201d\nBilbo sighs, exasperated. \u201cI know we are not friends,\u201d he says and F\u00edli\u2019s eyebrows rise. \u201cBut I would hear of your troubles, Master F\u00edli, for I don\u2019t like to see you worried or sad\u2014youngsters, in my opinion, should never feel those emotions unless absolutely necessary.\u201d\nF\u00edli bites his lip and looks back into the fire. They sit in silence for a long moment before F\u00edli sighs and looks back at Bilbo.\n\u201cK\u00edli and I\u2014our father died a long time ago,\u201d he says. \u201cJust after K\u00edli was born, in fact. I barely remember him and K\u00edli doesn\u2019t at all. Ever since we were little . . . Thorin was our father, d\u2019you see?\u201d\nOh.\n\u201cAnd you nearly lost him,\u201d Bilbo says softly.\u00a0\nF\u00edli shivers. \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t get the mountain back?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat if\u2014what if K\u00edli or Uncle get hurt? Azog, he was\u2014he was so intent on getting to Uncle, Master Baggins. He\u2019s killed our grandfather, Uncle Frerin\u2014\u201c\nBilbo reaches out and grasps F\u00edli\u2019s forearm. He\u2019s sure to a dwarf, his hold can\u2019t be more than a child clinging, but he grips as tight as he can anyway. F\u00edli turns to meet his gaze, wide-eyed with surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright to be afraid, Master F\u00edli,\u201d he says. F\u00edli grimaces, but Bilbo presses on. \u201cYavanna knows I\u2019ve been afraid more than once on this little trip of ours.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve come to understand is that you must work past it, if you\u2019re to get anything done at all. I would imagine that goes doubly for reclaiming a homeland, which seems to require quite a bit of courage. Thorin is\u2014well, he\u2019s lived through much worse than this. And you\u2019re there to keep K\u00edli out of trouble, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nF\u00edli stares down at Bilbo for a long moment, his face so blank that Bilbo begins to worry he\u2019s said something wrong. Then, to Bilbo\u2019s surprise, F\u00edli reaches out to draw him into a tight, warm hug. He hugs a little like his Uncle\u2014fierce, comforting, all-encompassing. Bilbo relaxes into his hold and smiles against his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose either of them,\u201d F\u00edli says against Bilbo\u2019s hair. \u201cOr you or anyone in the Company. Some days I want to tell Thorin we should just go back to Ered Luin and hope for the best, that Erebor isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s little people won\u2019t risk for their home,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think Thorin will ever turn back, especially not now that we\u2019re so close. So you\u2019ll just have to keep a weather eye, Master F\u00edli, and pray to Mahal that things turn out in our favor.\u201d\nF\u00edli draws back. \u201cAnd thank Mahal for giving us a hobbit,\u201d he says. \u201cFor Thorin would already be dead already if not for you.\u201d\n\u201cNot you too,\u201d Bilbo mutters. F\u00edli laughs. \u201cI jumped in without thinking. It\u2019s not like it was some sort of heroic deed. I would\u2019ve done it for any of you, not just Thorin\u2014\u201c\n\u201cOh, aye, Master Baggins, of that I have no doubt. Which is why I think it\u2019s time I give you something that I\u2019ve been meaning to pass on for some time.\u201d\nF\u00edli reaches into his tunic and draws out a small metal case. Bilbo tenses because he\u2019s seen a case like that before\u2014indeed, it might as well mirror the one K\u00edli flashed when he was presenting Bilbo with a\u2014\n\u201cIt is crafted from mine own hands,\u201d F\u00edli says as he offers his gift to Bilbo with a smile.\u00a0\nBilbo takes it from him and turns it over in his fingers. It is a bead like the ones that he\u2019s seen the dwarrows in the Company wear in their hair, though no one in the Shire has ever worn such jewelry in theirs. It is a small one, barely as wide as Bilbo\u2019s pinky finger and made of gold, of all things. Embossed into the metal is that crossed axes emblem again, the one Ori had told him was the symbol of Durin.\u00a0\n\u201cIt goes in your hair,\u201d F\u00edli says. \u201cYours is finally long enough for a braid, I think.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never braided my hair before,\u201d Bilbo says, baffled. \u201cI\u2019ve never braided anyone\u2019s hair before.\u201d\nF\u00edli goes very still. \u201cI would be honored,\u201d he says, low and serious, \u201cto braid your hair, if you would allow me to touch it, Bilbo.\u201d\nDwarrows are a tight-mouthed bunch, but Bilbo would have had to be blind and dumb not to notice the devotion and care they took with their hair and braids. He has a feeling braiding someone else\u2019s hair is an intimate act for dwarrows\u2014perhaps even as intimate as combing someone else\u2019s foot-hair is to hobbits. He hesitates, watches F\u00edli\u2019s face grow dim with sad understanding, and then sighs.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t muck it up,\u201d he says and turns with his back to F\u00edli for easier reach. \u201cI don\u2019t need to look sillier than I already am, with half my buttons missing and my second-best jacket nearly shredded to bits.\u201d\nF\u00edli doesn\u2019t say anything, and when Bilbo looks over his shoulder, F\u00edli\u2019s just staring at him, wide-eyed.\u00a0\n\u201cWell?\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cAre you going to do it or not?\u201d\nF\u00edli stares a little more, then grins. \u201cYes, Bilbo,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nHis hands are surprisingly gentle as he takes up strands of Bilbo\u2019s hair\u2014there\u2019s something a little disorienting about the feeling of them there, but it becomes quite soothing after a time. Bilbo\u2019s half-asleep when F\u00edli finishes and prods at him to hand over the bead.\u00a0\n\u201cDone,\u201d he says.\nBilbo reaches up to touch his hair cautiously, then more thoroughly once he realizes that the braid won\u2019t come undone at the slightest touch. F\u00edli\u2019s left some of his hair loose, only braiding half of his hair starting from the crown downward. It is a tight weave and feels oddly smooth to Bilbo\u2019s fingers. He turns to face F\u00edli and blinks with surprise at the honest satisfaction in F\u00edli\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should wear braids from now on,\u201d F\u00edli says.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cWe put braids in for battles or marriages or children,\u201d F\u00edli says. \u201cFor deaths, sometimes. Important events. You deserve a battle-braid by now. You faced down Azog the Defiler, after all.\u201d\nBilbo reaches out and carefully takes F\u00edli\u2019s hand. \u201cWhen the time comes to face him again,\u201d he says and F\u00edli\u2019s eyes darken, \u201cI will be between him and Thorin, just as I was before. And between him and K\u00edli. Or you.\u201d\nF\u00edli takes Bilbo\u2019s nape in his free hand and gives him a gentle forehead tap. \u201cWe did not know the gift Gandalf gave us when he led us to your home,\u201d he says. \u201cAkhm\u00e2n, irak'adad.\u201d[2]\n\u201cF\u00edli?\u201d\nF\u00edli pulls away so fast that Bilbo jumps a little. They both turn to see Thorin watching them, a strange look in his eyes that Bilbo can\u2019t quite read in the half-dark. Thorin takes a step forward, brow furrowing.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201c\u00a0\nHe stops dead, his gaze fixed on Bilbo\u2019s hair. Bilbo raises a hand to touch it and realizes that Thorin must have just seen F\u00edli\u2019s braid. He raises his chin and challenges Thorin to say anything about it\u2014Thorin\u2019s show remarkable resistance to the idea of Bilbo learning anything about dwarf culture, and doubtless sees the braid as some sort of affront or insult.\u00a0\nThorin turns on F\u00edli and says something in rapid Khuzdul. Whatever it is must be quite bad, for F\u00edli pales and trips over his words trying to get out a response. Thorin\u2019s gaze darkens even further, so F\u00edli must have (like always) managed to put his foot in it.\n\u201cWhy have you allowed F\u00edli to give you a braid?\u201d Thorin demands of Bilbo.\u00a0\nBilbo looks from F\u00edli to Thorin in utter confusion. \u201cHe gave me a bead,\u201d he says, and something about that must be terribly wrong, for if Thorin looked wrathful before, he looks ten times worse now. F\u00edli looks like he might actually be uttering his final prayers to Mahal, so Bilbo decides it\u2019s high time to do something. \u201cAs a gift of friendship.\u201d\nDead silence. The storm clouds in Thorin\u2019s expression lesson by a bit.\u00a0\n\u201cIs this true, nephew?\u201d\nF\u00edli\u2019s nod is so rapid that his head might spin off. \u201cHe\u2014I\u2019ve meant to give it to him since K\u00edli gifted him, uncle, but there never seemed to be the right time or\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAnd the braid?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to braid,\u201d Bilbo says. Thorin\u2019s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. Honestly. Do dwarrows think everyone braids their hair? \u201cThe bead is meant to be put in your hair, so I asked F\u00edli to do it for me, since I\u2019d probably just muck it up.\u201d\nThorin regards them both with suspicion. \u201cAnd it was a gesture of friendship?\u201d he asks, more to F\u00edli than to Bilbo. \u201cAnd nothing else?\u201d\nBilbo realizes, with a dawning embarrassment, that Thorin thinks F\u00edli might have had romantic intentions toward him.\u00a0\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing else!\u201d Bilbo says before F\u00edli can answer. \u201cBy the Valar, Thorin\u2014\u201c Something shifts in Thorin\u2019s expression, but Bilbo\u2019s too distracted by his outrage to put much note into it. \u201cHe\u2019s barely out of childhood!\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d F\u00edli says, outraged himself now. \u201cYou\u2019d be quite lucky to have my braid in your hair, Bilbo!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe both know that you come with your brother attached,\u201d Bilbo shoots back. \u201cThat\u2019s far too much work for one hobbit to handle!\u201d\nF\u00edli makes an extremely lewd gesture, coupled with a filthy smirk. \u201cWell, if you want to handle\u2014\u201c\n\u201cF\u00edli!\u201d Thorin barks and F\u00edli goes pale again. It\u2019s quite satisfying. \u201cYou have no interest in F\u00edli?\u201d Thorin asks Bilbo, his voice oddly intent.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Bilbo says, irritated. \u201cWhat a ridiculous question.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s nostrils flare. \u201cNot so ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cMany races find dwarrows desirable, Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo can quite imagine, for he\u2019s found several in the Company desirable\u2014including the one currently glowering at him. But Thorin\u2019s distaste is quite clear; look at how he reacted when he thought F\u00edli was interested in Bilbo! No, Thorin would not be happy to hear of the daydreams Bilbo sometimes entertains on their longer days of travel.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all a bit too tall for my taste,\u201d Bilbo lies through his teeth. \u201cAnd no respectable hobbit has quite so much hair on their face, or such small feet.\u201d\nNow both dwarrows are looking at him in outrage. They do remarkably similar when they make that expression\u2014all gaped mouth and raised brows.\u00a0\n\u201cSmall feet\u2014!\u201d F\u00edli says.\n\u201cToo tall\u2014!\u201d Thorin snarls.\nBilbo gathers up his blankets. This conversation has gotten quite silly enough for his tastes.\n\u201cThank you for the gift and the help, but I find I must go to bed right this instant,\u201d he says and, with as much dignity as he can muster, hurries off to his bedroll and leaves the two dwarrows behind to stew.\n\nGl\u00f3in\n\nIf they stay any longer at Beorn\u2019s, Bilbo might actually get used to a warm place to sleep and having enough food to eat. It\u2019s been far too long since he\u2019s gone to bed every night with a comfortably full belly.\u00a0\nHe sits out in Beorn\u2019s yard as the sun falls and smokes his pipe. Beorn, though he doesn\u2019t look it, has an extraordinarily green thumb\u2014though his garden is wild and rougher than any Bilbo might see in the Shire, it bursts with fruits and wildflowers. Bilbo exhales a perfect smoke ring and smiles as it drifts off into the night air. Much like Rivendell, this little house is full of peace; he wonders if Beorn would mind a visitor for a week or two on the trip back.\nThough as the days pass and he gets more and more fond of his companions, he finds it harder to imagine going back.\u00a0\n\u201cYou probably should head inside, Master Baggins.\u201d Bilbo looks over his shoulder to find Gl\u00f3in standing nearby, a pipe in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark soon and you know how Beorn is about being outside once night falls.\u201d\nBilbo sighs. \u201cI was going to go inside once I finished this bit of leaf,\u201d he says. \u201cWould you like to sit with me, Master Gl\u00f3in?\u201d\nGl\u00f3in hesitates, looking between the doors and Bilbo. Then he sighs and shoulders his way onto the small bench Bilbo\u2019s been sitting on.\u00a0\n\u201cYou come and sit out here for hours, Master Baggins,\u201d Gl\u00f3in says as he takes a puff from his own pipe. \u201cI cannae see the appeal myself, I must say.\u201d\nBilbo laughs. \u201cI miss my garden,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition for hobbits to start a garden together when they marry, y\u2019see, and my parents were careful with theirs.\u201d He sighs, takes a puff of the pipe. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it up since they died, as a way to remember them. Hopefully Master Gamgee down the road doesn\u2019t let it die while I\u2019m away.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t quite stomach the thought of his father\u2019s tomatoes or his mother\u2019s lilies dying. For many years, the garden was all he had\u2014no relatives he was especially close to once his parents died, no boon companions, no partner . . . . Bilbo hadn\u2019t realized until he came on this trip how lonely he had been, shut away in his house by himself.\n\u201cI am sorry for your loss, Master Baggins,\u201d Gl\u00f3in says. \u201c\u2019Tis a hard thing, to lose your parents.\u201d\n\u201cThey passed away some time ago,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cMy mother first, from a cough she got during the Fell Winter. My da loved her so much\u2014he followed not a year after, and though the doctors say it was some sort of illness in the lungs, I always thought it was a broken heart.\u201d Bilbo smiles, a little sadly. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t bear to live without her, you see.\u201d\nGl\u00f3in\u2019s silent for a long time. \u201cI don\u2019t like to imagine what the world would be without my wife,\u201d he says finally. \u201cOr my wee Gimli.\u201d\n\u201cYour son, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Bilbo asks, brightening a little. None of the dwarrows have been forthcoming about their families. \u201cHow old is he?\u201d\n\u201cAch, just 68,\u201d Gl\u00f3in says. He reaches to his neck and pulls out a locket, opening it to show two drawings within\u2014a dwarrowdam with a fine beard and a young dwarf with the looks of Gl\u00f3in around the eyes. \u201cHe was raring to come with us, but Thorin said he was too young. I\u2019m glad, considering the hardships we\u2019ve faced so far\u2014and we\u2019ve not even come to the dragon yet!\u201d\n\u201cI do worry about the younger ones,\u201d Bilbo admits. \u201cBut they\u2019ve all held up remarkably well.\u201d\n\u201cK\u00edli most of all,\u201d Gl\u00f3in admits. \u201cOri\u2019s got a good head on his shoulders, whatever his posturing, but K\u00edli\u2019s always been a wild little fellow\u2014I\u2019ve been impressed with him, these past few weeks. F\u00edli too.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re good lads,\u201d Bilbo says and the look Gl\u00f3in gives him makes him blush, for his warmth toward them must have surely shown. \u201cA credit to Thorin, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nGl\u00f3in\u2019s eyebrows shoot up, though Bilbo doesn\u2019t know what about that\u2019s surprising. Surely all the dwarrows must think so as well?\n\u201cAye, they are,\u201d Gl\u00f3in says, after a long pause. Bilbo frowns at him, but Gl\u00f3in just takes another puff of his pipe. \u201cDo you think often of returning home, Master Baggins?\u201d\nBilbo gives the question the consideration it\u2019s due.\n\u201cI love my home,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just the Shire, but Bag End itself\u2014it was built for my mother by my father, y\u2019see, for their wedding.\u201d\nGl\u00f3in nods. \u201cA most appropriate wedding gift,\u201d he says, sounding pleased.\u00a0\nBilbo belatedly remembers that dwarrows put much stock in craft-gifts\u2014by their standards, his father\u2019s wedding present must seem princely. Bilbo tamps down the sudden flood of warmth at that thought.\n\u201cBut as much as I love it, I can\u2019t deny that the thought of returning has began to trouble me rather than excite me,\u201d Bilbo admits. \u201cI used to travel much as a faunt\u2014I had forgotten the joy in it, being rather overwhelmed by the danger. I don\u2019t know what it will be like, to go back to the Shire after all this has ended.\u201d Bilbo laughs a little. \u201cGandalf did say I would not be the same.\u201d\nGl\u00f3in considers him. \u201cI have spent my life on the road, Master Baggins,\u201d he says finally. \u201cThere is nothing in it new or exciting to me anymore. But to have a place to call your own, to live in it and not fear enemies or departure\u2014aye, that is an idea that brings spark back to me, I admit.\u201d\nBilbo flushes. \u201cOh, dear, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201c\nGl\u00f3in smiles at him. \u201cI remember the beauty of the road,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce upon a time, I was as reluctant to leave it as you. But don\u2019t forget the wonder of home while you\u2019re on your feet, Master Baggins. \u2019Tis a glorious thing, to have a place to return to.\u201d\nThey sit in companionable silence for some time as the sun sinks ever lower. It is only when just the tip of it is just showing over the trees that Gl\u00f3in sets his pipe aside and stands. He looks down at Bilbo and smiles wide before reaching into his tunic.\n\u201cHold out your hand, Master Baggins,\u201d he says. Bilbo does so and Gl\u00f3in deposits something into his palm.\nBilbo holds it up, frowning. It looks to be a cuff of some kind, though it is too narrow to fit on wrist or ankle or even finger. It has the design of a dragon mid-flight, making a natural curve that\u2014Bilbo squints\u2014would fit just perfectly over the curve of his ear. The fine silver is etched with Khuzdul and the dragon has tiny rubies set for eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bilbo asks, transfixed. He touches a finger to the tiny dragon snout.\u00a0\nGl\u00f3in huffs. \u201cIt is crafted of mine hand. A cuff for the ear,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family are all jewelers, much like young K\u00edli. May I demonstrate its use?\u201d\nBilbo nods and the gift is swept from his fingers and secured deftly onto his left ear. It adds a slight weight, but the metal is light enough that after a moment, Bilbo can\u2019t really notice it. He turns his head this way and that to try and get a better look, but can only catch glimpses of the dragon\u2019s nose from the corner of his eye. Gl\u00f3in, however, looks supremely satisfied.\n\u201cFits perfectly,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little worried, considering how wee and odd your ears are, but I haven\u2019t lost my touch!\u201d\n\u201cMy ears are not wee and odd\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you another for your other ear once we reach Erebor,\u201d Gl\u00f3in continues. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a matching set. But one alone is striking\u2014perhaps you\u2019ll start a new fashion, Bilbo!\u201d He roars with laughter. \u201cWhat do you want for the other side? Another dragon? A bird? A bear perhaps?\u201d He winks.\nBilbo glares at him. \u201cI\u2019m sure I look quite ridiculous,\u201d he says. Gl\u00f3in\u2019s face darkens and he hastens to add, \u201cBecause I am not made to wear such finery! Of course this\u2014this\u2014ear-cuff is the best in the land, since it is made by your hands, Gl\u00f3in, but surely I look strange in it?\u201d\nGl\u00f3in\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cYou look magnificent,\u201d he says. He looks over Bilbo\u2019s shoulder and his face brightens. \u201cThorin! Come over here for a moment!\u201d\nBilbo wishes for a violent moment that his Eagle had actually dropped him on the way here.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it, Gl\u00f3in?\u201d Thorin says as he approaches. \u201cI was just for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou must settle something for us - Bilbo worries that his new finery does not suit him! What do you say, cousin?\u201d\nBilbo wildly wonders if Beorn will appear in bear-form and eat him.\nBooted feet appear in Bilbo\u2019s frame of vision, but Bilbo determinedly does not look up from the ground. His face is burning, he can feel it, so the contact of two fingers against his chin is oddly cool. He flinches and looks up out of instinct to meet Thorin\u2019s eyes\u2014except Thorin is not looking him the eye. He stares directly at the cuff on Bilbo\u2019s ear, his expression decidedly odd.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a long silence.\n\u201cThorin?\u201d Gl\u00f3in demands. He sounds odd too\u2014triumphant, though Bilbo can\u2019t guess what for. Perhaps because he got to make Bilbo look like a complete numpty. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nThorin\u2014Yavanna, Thorin actually jumps. He takes a step away from Bilbo and clears his throat and\u2014by the Valar, there is a blush rising up his cheekbones. Bilbo stares. He\u2019s never seen Thorin so flustered before.\n\u201cIt is a princely gift, cousin,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Bilbo not look well in it?\u201d Gl\u00f3in asks, sounding sly. Bilbo gives him a suspicious look, but all Gl\u00f3in\u2019s attention is on Thorin.\nThorin clears his throat and looks anywhere but Bilbo. \u201cIt\u2014suits the hobbit well,\u201d he says as if through gritted teeth, as if the very compliment had to be pulled from the darkest recesses of his soul.\nBilbo\u2019s abruptly extraordinarily cross.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to pander to my vanity,\u201d he says tartly. Thorin\u2019s eyes snap to him in a most satisfying way. \u201cI\u2019m not some fauntling going through their first courting.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cYou do look well in it,\u201d he says, with a bit more feeling than last time. \u201cIt suits you.\u201d Bilbo scoffs and Thorin\u2019s face darkens. \u201cYou do not believe me?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cShould I?\u201d Bilbo asks. \u201cYou sound the same giving compliment as you would giving funeral announcement.\u201d Gl\u00f3in suffers a sudden, mysterious coughing fit. Neither of them look at him. \u201cAre you not a king? Shouldn\u2019t you be well-versed in this kind of thing?\u201d\nThorin scowls. \u201cI have no patience for courtly airs or fripperies,\u201d he says. \u201cI say what I mean, as any good king should.\u201d\n\u201cEven good kings should be better at giving an honest compliment,\u201d Bilbo says, feeling much more relaxed now. \u201cHow do you expect to woo your intended if you sound like you are giving her a dire omen instead of telling her how nice her beard looks?\u201d\nGl\u00f3in\u2019s coughing fit grows louder.\u00a0\n\u201cI do not intend to court,\u201d Thorin snaps. \u201cYou look well in your Mahal-damned ear-cuff, Master Baggins, and I am going to go get my dinner now!\u201d He turns on his heel and stomps away. Bilbo watches him go, bemused.\n\u201cHe really is quite strange, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asks Gl\u00f3in, but Gl\u00f3in only bursts into peals of unmuffled laughter and is of no help at all.\n\nBifur\n\nBilbo\u2019s relief when they finally escape Mirkwood fades when he realizes, three days into their stay at Laketown, the reason most hobbits don\u2019t go swimming in icy water. The Company are preoccupied with preparations, so no one seems to notice that Bilbo\u2019s been sneezing a lot or that his voice is hoarse. Bilbo had felt fine when they first landed, but as the days pass his head begins to throb and his nose is so stuffed that it\u2019s hard to breathe.\nThe morning of their fourth day at Lake-town, Bilbo opens his eyes and immediately wishes he hadn\u2019t. Everything aches. His head feels as though it\u2019s been stuffed with cotton wool and his nose\u2014well, it feels rubbed raw from the number of times Bilbo had to blow yesterday.\u00a0\nBilbo just lays there under his blankets and tries not to move or breathe or be a hobbit. He wishes desperately for his mother, who always gave him hot soup and tea when he was sick and read by his bedside.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s nearly drifted off to sleep again when he hears the heavy clomp of boots and the door opening.\n\u201cMaster Baggins? It\u2019s already breakfast, what\u2014\u201c\u00a0\nBilbo whimpers and curls in on himself when his blankets are pushed off his body. There\u2019s a long pause and then a warm, heavy hand is on his forehead.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re burning up.\u201d Bilbo cracks an eye open and glares at Thorin, who\u2019s frowning down at him like Bilbo chose to get sick on purpose.\u00a0\n\u201cKnew that,\u201d he whispers to Thorin, his voice a cracked, hoarse thing. Thorin\u2019s frown deepens.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get \u00d3in,\u201d he says. \u201cHe might have something to ease you until you recover.\u201d\nBilbo expects him to leave immediately, but Thorin pauses for a moment, his hand lingering over Bilbo\u2019s brow. Their eyes meet and despite the aches and the stuffed nose and the burgeoning fever, Bilbo feels\u2014he\u2014\nThorin turns away, so hurriedly that he nearly runs into a dresser. \u201cI\u2019ll be back with \u00d3in,\u201d he says as he stomps out of the door.\u00a0\nBilbo closes his eyes. Foolish hobbit, he thinks.\n\u00d3in, predictably enough, prescribes bed-rest and warm food, but doesn\u2019t have much else to help. He orders Bilbo to drink tea and water and then turns a weather eye to the other dwarrows gathered in Bilbo\u2019s room\u2014the rest of the Company showed up not long after \u00d3in.\n\u201cI\u2019ll want someone to sit with him until he\u2019s feeling more himself,\u201d \u00d3in says. \u201cI can\u2019t be on watch all day and the lad will feel better to have someone nearby.\u201d\nBilbo might resent being treated like a child if he wasn\u2019t pathetically grateful that they weren\u2019t going to leave him all alone.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take first shift,\u201d Bofur says, gesturing toward Bombur and Bifur. \u201cA few hours apiece from each of us should do the trick, I think. The others can come in after we\u2019re done.\u201d\nBilbo closes his eyes as they discuss, exhaustion bogging him down. Before he hears the rest of the arrangement, he falls into sleep.\nWhen he wakes, Bifur sits at his bedside, carving something with a small, sharp knife. Bilbo watches his clever hands for a long moment, mind blank with exhaustion.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at that,\u201d Bilbo says after nearly a half-hour has passed. Bifur\u2019s managed to carve out the shape of an animal\u2014Bilbo thinks it\u2019s a badger.\u00a0\nBifur jumps and then looks down at him. His wide smile is guileless and happy and he makes some sort of motion with his arm. Bilbo wishes, not for the first time, that whatever sign language the dwarrows had was more like the one hobbits used. Bilbo knows enough of the hobbit one to have a decent conversation\u2014he learned when one of his cousins had been born without the use of her ears. But whatever the dwarrows use is much different; Bilbo can\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never liked being ill,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cEven as a faunt.\u201d\nBifur makes a low, sympathetic noise. His hands never stop moving; even when he\u2019s looking at Bilbo, he\u2019s still carving. It\u2019s an extraordinary kind of skill. Bilbo\u2019s never been a deft hand at carving, though Belladonna did teach him some embroidery and he\u2019s a decent cook.\u00a0\nHe wonders what it must be like, to devote yourself to one craft for the entirety of your life. Surely some of the oldest dwarrows must be masters of their craft indeed\u2014200 years devoted to one thing! Bilbo can\u2019t even imagine it.\u00a0\nThe door opens and Bofur pops his head inside. \u201cAh, you\u2019re awake,\u201d he says, smiling and stepping into the room. \u201cYou worried us when you dropped off.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have I been asleep?\u201d Bilbo asks.\n\u201cOh, about half the day. It\u2019s quite late now and it was mid-afternoon when \u00d3in was here to check on you.\u201d\nBilbo grimaces. \u201cThank you for looking after me,\u201d he says, directing it to both of them. \u201cI hate to be a bother when we\u2019re so close to finishing.\u201d\n\u201cThorin needs a bit more time to get what we need,\u201d Bofur says, settling in on an extra chair. \u201cAnd besides, it\u2019s finally your time, Bilbo! This is what we dragged you all over Middle-Earth for\u2014we can hardly leave you behind now!\u201d\n\u201cBut Durin\u2019s Day is so close,\u201d Bilbo frets. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m still sick? What if I\u2014\u201c\nBifur lays a hand on Bilbo\u2019s and says something in Khuzdul.\u00a0\n\u201cHe says you needn\u2019t worry,\u201d Bofur translates, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, Bilbo. Honestly, if it weren\u2019t for you, we\u2019d still be stuck in Thranduil\u2019s prison when Durin\u2019s Day passed\u2014at least you\u2019ve given us a better chance!\u201d\nBilbo frowns. \u201cI just hate to be a bother,\u201d he mutters.\u00a0\nBifur says something again and while Bilbo can\u2019t understand the words, the irritation comes across rather clear. Bofur laughs.\n\u201cMy uncle thinks you are too hard on yourself, Bilbo,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I rather agree. We all owe our lives to you several times over\u2014don\u2019t think we\u2019ll forget that.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s not sure if the heat in his face is a blush or the fever, but he decides to blame the fever as he burrows back down under his covers. Bofur laughs, but doesn\u2019t call Bilbo out\u2014instead, Bilbo can hear him settling in his chair. Bilbo smiles a little under his blankets; it\u2019s nice, to have people who are willing to look after him. To think that this group would have tossed him off the side of the road if he had dared fall ill during those first weeks!\u00a0\nHe\u2019s nearly asleep again when something drops on top of his covered head. Bilbo yawns and peeps out to meet the gaze of the newly carved badger sitting on his blankets. It\u2019s face is twisted in a ferocious snarl that bares all its teeth, and it is ruffled with rage. Bilbo\u2019s never seen a badger in person before, but he thinks it a fair likeness; in any case, it is intimidating, even for a carving. Bilbo touches one of its cleverly made ears and wonders if Bifur would be willing to teach Bilbo how to do that. He\u2019s never been a fair hand at wood-carving.\nBifur says something in Khuzdul, sounding shy.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is made of his own hand,\u201d Bofur translates. \u201cAs you well know, since he did it while he was standing guard by your bedside.\u201d\nBilbo smiles up at Bifur. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why a badger?\u201d\nBifur\u2019s face goes distinctly sheepish and he mutters something that makes Bofur roar with laughter.\n\u201cHe says\u2014\u201c Bofur gasps. \u201cHe says it reminds him of you!\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s smile slides into a scowl. A badger? He looks down at the ferocious little creature and his ire turns considering. He\u2019s heard stories about badgers\u2014slow to anger, but if their nest or cubs were attacked, they would attack more viciously than any other animal on Middle-Earth. Bilbo picks up the carving and brings it to eye-level, admiring the animal\u2019s bravery. He might need something of that courage, to face a dragon, something of that ferocity.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Bilbo says to Bifur. \u201cI will treasure it.\u201d\nBifur grins at him and thumps his chest even as he speaks. Bilbo looks to Bofur, who seems oddly subdued after Bifur finishes.\n\u201cHe says it is a good-luck token,\u201d Bofur says. \u201cFor when you go to face the dragon. There\u2019s a rune on the underside, see?\u201d Bilbo turns the badger over and there is indeed a small rune carved at the bottom. \u201cIt\u2019s for providence and safe-carriage. We usually use it to protect travelers going into dark places.\u201d\n\u201cVery apt,\u201d Bilbo says, a little grimly. He nods to Bifur. \u201cI will carry it with me into that dark place.\u201d\nBofur sighs. \u201cFirst you must get well, Bilbo,\u201d he says. \u201cThen you can go charging off to steal from dragons.\u201d\n\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d Bilbo agrees and Bifur laughs.\u00a0\nBilbo settles back into bed as Bifur and Bofur talk in rapid Khuzdul, the badger sitting on his chest. He curls a hand around it and feels hopeful for the first time since remembering his task.\n\nThorin\n\nBilbo\u2019s had it up to here with Thorin bloody Oakenshield.\u00a0\nDismissing Bard like that! Refusing to open the doors! Searching for that bloody Arkenstone day and night as if a gem has anything to do with the army on their doorstep. Bilbo\u2019s put up with a lot on this little adventure of theirs\u2014hard beds, terrible smells, not nearly enough meals, near-death\u2014but this takes the figurative cake!\u00a0\nThorin\u2019s not in the treasure room when Bilbo comes stomping in, but F\u00edli and K\u00edli are. They freeze when they see him, the expressions on their faces nearly a mirror to the ones Bilbo\u2019s younger cousins wore when Bilbo caught them stealing from the cookie jar.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Bilbo asks. He is even-voiced and pleasant, but F\u00edli and K\u00edli pale.\u00a0\n\u201cHe, uh\u2014\u201c\n\u201cLook, Bilbo\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhere is he.\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli exchange looks of resigned despair.\n\u201cThe throne room,\u201d F\u00edli says, proving that he is the smarter of the two brothers.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t murder him,\u201d K\u00edli says as Bilbo stomps out.\nBilbo says nothing because Bilbo doesn\u2019t believe in making false assurances or promises he can\u2019t keep.\u00a0\nThe throne room is dark and empty except for the brooding figure perched on the ridiculously large throne. The throne had been overturned when they found it, but the combined efforts of the Company had righted it again. Still, it is much too large for any dwarf, even one as tall and broad as Thorin. Bilbo\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d look like a child if he tried to sit in it.\nGandalf wasn\u2019t lying when he said that hobbits could be light on their feet\u2014Bilbo, when he\u2019s conscious about it, moves almost soundlessly. He creeps through the shadows until he\u2019s only a few feet from the throne and the brooding moron sitting on it before he clears his throat. Thorin actually jumps, which makes Bilbo viciously happy.\n\u201cMaster Baggins\u2014!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you remember a conversation we had not long ago, Master Oakenshield?\u201d Bilbo asks, adopting the pleasant tone he\u2019d used against F\u00edli and K\u00edli. Thorin\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWe talked about how displeased I would be if you squandered the life I saved.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe I\u2019m squandering it, Master Baggins?\u201d Thorin asks, thunder on his brow. \u201cYou think I throw it away foolishly? This is my kingdom, that is my gold\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cWhat good is a kingdom without people?\u201d Bilbo demands, abandoning pleasantness. \u201cWhat good is gold\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIt is mine by right!\u201d Thorin roars. \u201cMahal be damned, I will not let anyone take it from me\u2014not the bowman, not the elves, not even you!\u201d\u00a0\nBilbo stares at him, stunned, and Thorin recollects himself, his anger draining away.\n\u201cI will not apologize for protecting what I have given so many years to reclaim,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIs this truly what you came back for? Is this really the Erebor you fought for? This empty husk, filled with corpses and jewels? Thorin\u2014\u201c\nThorin\u2019s face twists. \u201cI wish you would not call me that!\u201d\n\u201cCall you\u2014?\u201d Bilbo has to consciously retrace his words before he realizes and colors. \u201cAh. I see. My apologies, it slipped out\u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou have called me such since our travels began,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cAt first, I knew it to be ignorance\u2014and when you came to realize how my people feel on such matters, your persistence felt more like a promise. A declaration.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\u201cBut now here you stand, insisting I give away my line\u2019s birthright to the unworthy,\u201d Thorin says. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s talking to himself now, not to Bilbo. \u201cYou are a maddening creature, Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo puffs up in indignation. \u201cI am the only sensible one in this gorram mountain!\u201d he spits. \u201cYou will risk your life\u2014risk F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s lives\u2014the lives of this entire Company\u2014for\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014the craft that belongs to my people!\u201d Thorin bellows, anger returning. \u201cYou know now what it means to us, so how can you stand there and insist we give it to those we do not cherish\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cI insist because craft is nothing if you are not alive!\u201d Bilbo yells. \u201cCraft is nothing if it means you and the others being buried!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOutsiders can never understand,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cIt is like giving away a limb\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThen give it away,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cBetter a limb than a body.\u201d\nThorin turns away from him. \u201cLeave me, Master Baggins. I will not move on this matter.\u201d\nBilbo stares at that profile, the one he\u2019d traced so often during the past few months that he could probably draw it from memory now. He\u2019s trembling, he notes with a distant sort of understanding. He remembers the way the others talked of Thr\u00f3r, the way they whispered of dragon-sickness, the bloodlust in Thorin\u2019s eyes when Bilbo had first tried to escape Smaug. The way Thorin searches, day and night, for the Arkenstone.\u00a0\nIf this continues, Bilbo knows there will be war. And he\u2019s no longer that naive hobbit from the Shire: people die in wars. His friends could die and he won\u2019t have that, he won\u2019t lose the people he loves again when he\u2019s only just realized how much he needs them. He won\u2019t allow it.\nBilbo marches up to Thorin Oakenshield\u2019s bloody throne and slaps him hard across the cheek. Bilbo\u2019s entire palm stings, but the way Thorin turns to him, wide-eyed and incredulous, is more than worth it. Bilbo reaches out and grasps one of Thorin\u2019s beard braids, using it to reel him in until they are nearly nose-to-nose. Thorin\u2019s eyes are huge now and somewhere in the back of his brain Bilbo\u2019s in awe at his own daring, but there isn\u2019t time to care.\n\u201cYou listen to me,\u201d Bilbo says in the low, fierce tone he remembers his mother using whenever she was truly angry. \u201cI understand that that gold out there is important to you and I don\u2019t begrudge you that. But if you think for one second that gold is worth more than your life or your sister-sons\u2019 lives or the lives of anyone in this mountain, then you are not the dwarf I ran out of my door and left everything behind to follow.\u201d He tugs on Thorin\u2019s braid sharply, but the gesture is unnecessary\u2014he has Thorin\u2019s undivided attention. \u201cYou are not your grandfather, Thorin. You made a promise to those people out there\u2014and a promise to us, as well. Is your word worth so little, that you\u2019ll throw it away like garbage? Are our lives worth so little that you\u2019ll let us be flimsy shields for a horde?\u201d\nThere\u2019s something happening to Thorin. His eyes shift, expression tightening, as if he\u2019s fighting some inner battle of his own. Bilbo keeps his hold on Thorin\u2019s braid and watches the shift. In his pocket, the Arkenstone is like a heavy weight and an idea occurs to him. It might be the wrong move\u2014may push Thorin back toward the dragon-fever\u2014but Bilbo\u2019s out of options and ideas.\u00a0\nHe reaches into his coat with his free hand and pulls it out of his pocket. Thorin\u2019s arrested immediately, eyes narrowing on the gem even as he reaches for it. Bilbo\u2019s fingers tighten around it.\n\u201cThis is what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThis is the stone you\u2019ll give all our lives for?\u201d\u00a0\nThorin doesn\u2019t look at him. Bilbo starts to panic\u2014perhaps this was a mistake, perhaps he messed it all up, he has to do something, anything to get Thorin to look away from the stone\u2014\nBilbo reels Thorin in and kisses him square on the mouth.\nFor a moment, they stand there, each frozen\u2014Bilbo\u2019s panic triples and he wonders if he should pull away, pretend it never happened, obviously this was the wrong solution, oh Yavanna\u2014\nThen Thorin\u2019s hand slides into Bilbo\u2019s hair, catching on the braid F\u00edli gave him, and they are\u2014they are kissing.\u00a0\nBilbo makes a small noise in the back of his throat as Thorin deepens the kiss, not sure what to do with his hands or his lips. By the Valar, it\u2019s been years since he\u2019s done this, years since he was young enough to kiss someone for the joy of it. He still clutches the Arkenstone in one fist, but he moves his other hand from Thorin\u2019s beard to his hair.\u00a0\nThe kiss goes on\u2014it could be seconds or minutes or years. When they finally pull apart, Bilbo feels shaky, untethered. As if the mountain underneath his feet has disappeared.\nThorin\u2019s eyes are fixed on Bilbo\u2019s face. The gloom that has lingered on his brow since they first met has melted away and Thorin, to Bilbo\u2019s embarrassed pleasure, looks as if the world has just given him a treasured gift.\u00a0\n\u201cYou said I was too tall,\u201d Thorin says.\nBilbo blinks, caught off-guard. When\u2014? His mouth twitches as he remembers; the night at Beorn\u2019s, when F\u00edli gifted him. Thorin\u2019s indignant frown when Bilbo pretended he didn\u2019t find any dwarf attractive.\n\u201cI find that I can overlook that,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nThorin\u2019s smile is a glorious thing, untouched by grief or fury. His eyes, for the first time in days, are clear as a summer morning and Bilbo\u2019s eyes burn. It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s reaching to rub at them that he realizes he still holds the Arkenstone; his heart skitters when Thorin remembers and looks down at the stone in Bilbo\u2019s fist with consideration.\u00a0\n\u201cYou had it all this time?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI found it when I first confronted Smaug,\u201d Bilbo admits. Thorin\u2019s eyes flash. \u201cI almost gave it to you, when you met me in the hall,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2014\u201c He shivers, remembering the look Thorin had given him. \u201cYou were not yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI frightened you,\u201d Thorin realizes.\u00a0\n\u201cSmaug told me it would change you,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe him, but you acted so strange then, and in the days that followed. I didn\u2019t want to give you the stone if it would make it worse.\u201d\nThorin looks from the stone to Bilbo\u2019s face and then, to Bilbo\u2019s surprise, begins to laugh. Bilbo\u2019s never heard him laugh before\u2014it is a deep sound, a belly-chuckle that makes Bilbo smile in response.\n\u201cYou are a wonder, Master Baggins,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cI did not believe Gandalf, when he told me you would be essential\u2014but here you are, dragging me kicking and screaming out of the dragon-fever that ruined my grandfather.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not feel it anymore?\u201d Bilbo asks, hopeful.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a distant thing,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cWhereas before, it blinded all my reason. The stone in your hand\u2014five minutes ago, I would\u2019ve died for it. Now, it is only a stone; beautiful, but no more so than any other.\u201d\n\u201cThank the Valar,\u201d Bilbo breathes. \u201cThen you will not go to war with Bard and Thranduil? You will make peace?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s face darkens at Thranduil\u2019s name, but it is not the kind of anger that has ruled him for the past few days.\n\u201cI will give Bard and his people what they are due,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cWe woke the dragon and it ruined their home. I can do no less. Thranduil . . . .\u201d\n\u201cAll he wants are jewels that his people\u2019s,\u201d Bilbo says. \u201cIs it really that much to ask?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s eyes flash, but when he sees Bilbo\u2019s scowl, his anger abates and he smiles instead.\n\u201cIf I say no,\u201d he says, fonder than Bilbo\u2019s ever heard him, \u201cI suspect you will bully me until I change my mind.\u201d\nBilbo sniffs, affronted. \u201cI would only reason with you until you come to your senses,\u201d he says. Feeling a little sly, he adds, \u201cOr kiss you until you\u2019re senseless and more amiable to my way of thinking.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cI did not realize hobbits were so indecent, Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo scowls. \u201cYou still call me by title?\u201d he asks, a little hurt.\nThorin startles, expression changing swiftly to embarrassed realization. He shifts away from Bilbo and reaches over the throne to grab something hidden on the other side. When he turns, he presents it to Bilbo with a wry smile.\n\u201cIt is crafted of mine own hand,\u201d he says.\nBilbo takes it and gasps as it unfolds: a shirt made of pale gems, beautifully wrought and lighter than it has any right to be. He holds it to his nose to examine the way the links sparkle in the torchlight. For a moment, Bilbo feels as if he holds starlight at his fingertips.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks, awed.\n\u201cMithril,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cA precious gem that is stronger than almost anything\u2014that shirt will deflect all but the hardest blows. I crafted it when I was just a dwarfling, before Smaug came to the mountain. It was my choosing craft.\u201d [3]\nBilbo runs a reverent hand over it. \u201cIt is a princely gift,\u201d he says. \u201cBut surely F\u00edli or K\u00edli\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThey can take care of themselves,\u201d Thorin says. \u201cIt would\u2014it would give me great peace of mind, to know that you had this to protect you, Bilbo.\u201d\nBilbo shudders a little. Thorin\u2019s never called him by name before.\u00a0\n\u201cCan you\u2014\u201c Bilbo clutches the shirt to his chest and tries not to show how flushed he is. \u201cCan you say that again?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s eyebrows lift and he smiles, a little sly. \u201cBilbo?\u201d he says and Bilbo\u2019s shudder goes from ear to toe. Thorin leans in and presses a soft, chaste kiss to Bilbo\u2019s forehead. \u201cBilbo.\u201d\nBilbo closes his eyes, leans in as Thorin presses a kiss to his cheek, then to his left eyelid, then to the tip of his nose . . . .\u00a0\nBy the time Thorin reaches his lips, Bilbo\u2019s smiling."
