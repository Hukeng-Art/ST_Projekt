    "notes": "<p>A/N: So, some quick Doctor Who notes for anyone not fluent in the show. The Weeping Angels are aliens that disguise themselves as statues and can only move when you aren\u2019t looking at them, like turning your back or blinking. They kill you by sending you back in time and letting you live out your life in the past, and feed off the years you would have lived in the future. The Doctor is a centuries old time travelling alien who \u201cregenerates\u201d and shifts faces instead of dying. The Doctor mentioned in this fic is the 10th Doctor played by David Tennant and his companion is Rose, whom the 9th and 10th Doctors were in love with. They had a bit of a tragic love story that ended kind of happily. Torchwood was an agency started by Queen Victoria to monitor alien activity (The Doctor, specifically) and UNIT is also an agency that deals with aliens in the Doctor Who universe. Everything Eggsy remembers happening are things alien related that happened to London in Doctor Who during his lifetime that he thus would have remembered. And that\u2019s all you need to know about Doctor Who for this fic, though it is a great show and I do recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A/N: So yeah, time travel shenanigans. This ship is like a black hole of AUs, and I am getting sucked into it hard. The Doctor Who stuff is just contained to this chapter - it\u2019s more a plot device than a true crossover. But, to come in part 2 - pining!Eggsy thinking Harry is straight, pining!Harry thinking Eggsy is with Lancelot, resolution and bendy young people sex, and then some good old fix it fun with Gazelle and Lee Unwin. You\u2019ll also probably note that I\u2019m writing Eggsy differently than I normally do - this is deliberate, as I\u2019m trying to play up that whole Eggsy is the mature agent one and Harry is the younger, less sure one. And yes, his fake name is Ward because that's Julia Robert's character's last name in Pretty Woman, because I do intend to beat that one reference into the ground. Again, tumblr is a horrible place full of enablers with prompts, and I am weak. Enjoy as always, and comments feed the muse.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I still don't own it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A/N: So pleased people are enjoying this little AU! I originally was going to have this chapter and the next one be one chapter, but this got longer than expected, and real life demanded more time, so I figured I try to get this part out at least. The downside is that it\u2019s going to be a good while before I have time to write again - I\u2019ve got another super fun medical school exam coming up, and then an actually super fun trip to Europe for 9 days (wheeee!) after that, so we\u2019re looking at three weeks at the shortest before the final part is up, and my apologies for that. But, it\u2019ll have Lee, Gazelle and it will be fix-it fluffy, so at least there is that! Also, yeah, if you find you have developed diabetes after reading this, I take no legal responsibility ;) So, as always enjoy, and comments feed the muse.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A/N: So yeah, the delay on this is kind of inexcusable, but I do sort of have valid reason in the form of a health crisis where one of the three possible diagnosis they were going to give me for what I had was cancer, and that sort of...wasn\u2019t conductive to creativity. I don\u2019t have cancer, thank goodness, though I do have a chronic illness that I\u2019m starting to be able to manage now, which isn\u2019t exactly ideal, but a lot better than the alternative!! So yeah, that was the state of my life the last few months, and just add med school and you get very little writing done! But I feel a bit better, and I\u2019m finally on my break, so I\u2019m going to try and get my unfinished fics done at least, and a million thank you\u2019s and apologies for the wait and for everyone who stuck around with this fic for much longer than I had intended!</p>\n<p>Also I got a lot of comments about people worried this chapter was going to hurt, and I have to ask; what part of my ridiculous fix-it fervour for this pairing made you think that? ;) Seriously, the movie is angst enough for this pairing - fix-it is for fluff, as I always say, and I hope I\u2019ve delivered on that in this fic :) So, as always comments make the world go round, and I hope you enjoyed the fic!</p>",
    "text": "***************************************\nAmy: Could you? Could you if it was me? Could you do it?\nRory (her husband): To save you, I could do anything. \n\u00a0\nThe Doctor: What the hell are you doing?!?! \nAmy: Changing the future. It's called marriage. \n- Doctor Who, The Angels Take Manhattan\n***************************************\nLife goes on, after Harry dies.\nIt seems unfair that it does sometimes, Eggsy admits. Sometimes he feels like time should have just stopped when Harry died, that it should have respected the magnitude of his loss in some tangible way. But that isn\u2019t how the universe works, Eggsy knows; time goes on no matter what, and so Eggsy forces himself to as well. It\u2019d be a grave insult to Harry\u2019s memory if he didn\u2019t, Eggsy knows, because Harry believed in him in a way no one had before. Kingsman was Harry\u2019s last gift to Eggsy, and Eggsy refuses to waste it.\nBesides, he looks damn good in a suit, if he does say so himself.\nStill, there is a clear progression of his life, after Harry. Because Eggsy had loved him, from almost the moment he\u2019d sat back down in the pub after cleaning Dean\u2019s goons clocks, and Harry died never getting to hear him say it.\nThat sort of thing leaves wounds that take time to heal.\nAnd so, in the progression of his life, 2015 is the year of grief. Eggsy sleeps in Harry\u2019s red robe until the smell of him disappears, and occasionally looks over his shoulder when someone calls him Galahad, expecting to find Harry standing right behind him. He spends hours pouring over every report and video recording of Harry\u2019s tenure as Galahad, trying to find even the tiniest remnant of the man still in them, but feels only more alone every time he does. Still, he is an exemplary agent; he starts his own wall of mundane front page articles, and by the end of 2015 there are 12 of them already.\nIt doesn\u2019t make him feel any better.\n2016 is the year of anger. Eggsy drinks a little too much, has unwise sex with some dodgy individuals, and his post mission reports start to skirt around phrases like \u201cexcessive use of force.\u201d That bloody church in Kentucky reopens and starts preaching its hate again, and Eggsy finds himself tempted to go there and kill them all himself, because why do they, pathetic little hateful people that they are get to rebuild and be again when Harry, who was ten times the man they all were combined, is still fucking dead? He breaks three mission related records and adds 17 more articles to his wall.\nLet no one say anger isn't a motivating force.\n2017 is the year of acceptance. Eggsy goes to a Kingsmen therapist and actually starts dealing with his feelings like a mature adult. He loses his chav accent and develops a fairly decent posh one, because Harry might have thought that being a gentleman was unrelated to the way you spoke, but gun running members of the House of Lords disagree, apparently, and bulletproof suit or not getting shot fucking hurts. He is still himself - relentlessly loyal, irreverent of most things and appreciative of a little sense of the theatrical - he is just more...refined. He learns the art of patience in holding his tongue when playing cards with a disgusting human trafficker. He can seduce a cold blooded assassin with charm and grace, speak fluent French and passable Italian, and he can sit with Lords and heads of state and look like he belongs, like he\u2019d been born in a suit like this.\nBy the end of 2017 he\u2019s got 40 articles on his wall, and he\u2019s the best knight the agency has, to the teasing consternation of Roxy, who is undeniably the second best and aiming for the top, as always.\nThere will always be a part of him that loves Harry, Eggsy knows. That part that thinks of all that they could have been and mourns the loss. That remembers the warmth in his chest that had bloomed whenever Harry\u2019s smiled at him, and the hint of desire he\u2019d felt looking at the curve of those lips. But now, three years on, Eggsy can feel those things and not let them consume him. He can think, Harry would have loved that when he executes a particularly wicked maneuver on a mission without a twinge of pain accompanying the thought.\nEggsy\u2019s grown into the man he thinks Harry saw in him, is finally living up to that potential, and finally, it\u2019s a realization that no longer comes with crushing sadness. He thinks, three years after Harry\u2019s death, he might be ready to start moving on, so to speak, and he knows it\u2019d be what Harry\u2019d of wanted for him.\nHe thinks, perhaps, 2018 will be the year of peace.\nAnd then in April, Merlin sends him to investigate the fact that people have started disappearing after visiting a graveyard known for it\u2019s angel statues.\nPeace might not have been the right word.\nThe progression of his life gets a little more...complicated then.\n***************************************\nThe first thing Eggsy would like to make known when he arrives at the graveyard is that these\u00a0are some seriously fucked up statues. Eggsy\u2019s never been one to startle at scary movies or the like, but there is something about these things that just creeps him the fuck out. They\u2019ve all got their hands to their eyes like they\u2019re weeping, or hiding, and Eggsy can\u2019t shake the irrational feeling that they\u2019re somehow peeking out at him behind from their stone hands.\nLike they\u2019re waiting.\n Lovely, Eggsy thinks, rolling his shoulders to try and dispel the tension that\u2019s gathered there, it\u2019d\u00a0just be his luck to survive Harry\u2019s death intact and then lose his wits over a few statues.\nStill, bizarre feeling aside, Eggsy\u2019s got a job to do, and so he activates his glasses feed and says, as protocol demands, \u201cGalahad checking in at the site. No suspicious activity to report as of yet.\u201d\nThe statues, he thinks pointedly to himself, don\u2019t count.\nMerlin, the ever faithful voice in his ear responds as expected, a causal humour born of familiarity in his tone, \u201cAcknowledged. A thorough sweep through is probably in order, and then I\u2019ll let you stop chasing wild geese.\u201d\nAnd Eggsy\u2019s about to shoot some quip back, some little witticism that will make Merlin huff with laughter under his breath, because that\u2019s their thing, but then something moves in the periphery of his eye, and Eggsy whips around, trying to track the movement.\nBut all he sees is a statue, wings tucked into it\u2019s back, eyes playfully hidden.\nA statue that was not that close a moment ago.\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Eggsy finds himself saying, barely able to trust his own eyes, but that one angel was way further away, he knows that, \u201cI think that statue moved.\u201d\n\u201cGalahad, what are you talking about?\u201d Merlin asks, with his yes, really, that isn\u2019t funny tone, but Eggsy\u2019s got bigger problems, because he knows there wasn\u2019t a statue behind him a moment ago, and now there is.\n\u201cMerlin, there\u2019s something wrong with these statues, I mean it,\u201d Eggsy says, as serious as can be, staring at the one in front of him and, in the reflection of his lens the one that is definitely now behind him, that now has it\u2019s hands away from it\u2019s face to bare its sharp teeth.\nTeeth that sharp are never a good sign.\nThe fact that it\u2019s a statue, and it\u2019s hands have one hundred percent moved to expose said teeth is probably also not a good sign, Eggsy thinks.\n\u201cEggsy -,\u201d Merlin starts, voice somewhere between concern and patient reassurance, but Eggsy never hears how that sentence was going to end, because Eggsy blinks, and then Merlin\u2019s just gone.\nEggsy is too.\n***************************************\nWhen he opens his eyes, barely even a second later, Eggsy finds himself in an alley in what is\u00a0unmistakably London, graveyard no where in sight and nothing but static in his ears.\nTo say he\u2019s confused would be...greatly understating the matter.\nHe taps his glasses a few times, tries hailing Merlin, and when he still gets nothing but static, he starts to worry a bit, because the glasses are fine, he discerns, they\u2019re still transmitting.\nIt\u2019s like...no one is there to receive it.\n\u201cOi mate, you alright there?\u201d A voice says, pulling him away from that disturbing thought, and he looks up to find a man standing there staring at him a bit suspiciously. But what catches Eggsy\u2019s eye is the fact that the guy\u2019s got a haircut and wardrobe that he apparently stole from the eighties, or something because that hair is just not ok, and he\u2019s pretty sure he can see shoulder pads in the guy\u2019s jacket.\nThere\u2019s this foreboding feeling starting to grow in the depth of his stomach.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just...\u201d Eggsy starts, and then, because he\u2019s lived in London all his life and this is wrong - the cars are too old and the streetlights aren\u2019t what they were yesterday - he finds himself asking, that feeling starting to move to his chest as it grows, \u201cWhat\u2019s the date?\u201d\n\u201cApril 8th,\u201d The man says, with a look that Eggsy knows is him wondering what kind of bender Eggsy\u2019d been on, but Eggsy can\u2019t even begin to feel relief at the fact the day is the same, because now he\u2019s finally got a good look at London, and there are a few things missing.\nEggsy can\u2019t see The Shard or The Eye from here, and so he asks, because he\u2019s got this terrible feeling that might not be because of where he\u2019s standing but when, \u201cWhat\u2019s the year?\u201d\n\u201c1988,\u201d The man says, like it should be obvious, lifting his eyebrows high as he asks incredulously, \u201cHow much did you drink last night mate?\u201d\nAnd Eggsy\u2019d write it off as a prank, as a late and truly unfunny April Fool\u2019s Day joke, except for the fact that there is a red news kiosk right beside him, the kind where you stick in the money and take the paper, and Eggsy can read the front page from where he\u2019s standing. The headline, truly banal, proclaims, English Pound Note ceases to be legal Tender, but the date, innocuous and innocent in the corner is what catches Eggsy\u2019s eye, holds it and his breath hostage.\nApril 8th, 1988.\n\u201cNot nearly enough,\u201d Eggsy manages, standing on a street corner three years before he\u2019s even\u00a0born, and wishes desperately for a pint or five.\n***************************************\nLook, Eggsy\u2019s a London boy, through and through. He might have shed himself of the estate\u00a0accent of his youth, but he still lived there, and as such, he remembers all the alien shite no one ever talks about. The Christmas it rained ash, that spaceship that hit Big Ben, The Battle of Canary Wharf and the 456 and the way parents held onto their children a little closer that year. The unspoken rule about being from London might be that you don\u2019t mention any of this shite, because somehow most of the rest of the world seems to have forgotten it, but people like Eggsy, a dyed in the wool Londoner, remember. Point he\u2019s trying to make is this: the knowledge that aliens exist makes suddenly ending up in 1988 after investigating moving statues a possibility, rather than a sign of mental illness.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean Eggsy doesn\u2019t allows himself five minutes to panic and freak out. Five minutes to just stare at the date at the paper and think, what the bleeding fuck?\nAnd then those five minutes pass, and Eggsy does what any mature, cultured gentleman spy would do when confronted by a situation like this.\nHe breaks into Torchwood.\nApparently, Eggsy thinks as he leaves in record time, needed info in hand, their security in 1988\u00a0was shite.\n***************************************\nThe answer to how he\u2019s ended up here is...somehow both helpful and equally unhelpful at the\u00a0same time.\nThe Weeping Angels, Eggsy reads on the stolen Torchwood intel. Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor\u2019s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it\u2019s the slow road back to the present for you.\nEggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He\u2019s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up \u2019til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he\u2019s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he\u2019s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he\u2019s even there would be...20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young.\nShite, even Harry\u2019d only be...\n Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can\u2019t hold him.\nThis is 1988, and Harry\u2019s 23, and alive.\nSuddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\n***************************************\nThe problem of being stuck with no identification three years before he is even born is not really\u00a0a problem. The Kingsman certainly have the ability to fabricate him an ID that could have him strolling into Buckingham Palace and meeting the security checks if he so pleased.\nThe problem is getting into the Kingsman. Because yes, Eggsy discovers after doing a little recon, Chester King is most certainly Arthur, and right up until the moment Eggsy\u2019d killed him, Chester King had pretty much hated his guts.\nTo be fair, he\u2019d probably have hated him after that as well, if not for the whole \u2018killed him\u2019 thing.\nBut that needs to be overcome, and so it will be, Eggsy thinks, because he has a plan and he won\u2019t let anything get in his way. And it\u2019s not a very complicated plan, really; in theory its quite simple. In 2015, on Valentine\u2019s Day - can\u2019t say the man hadn't had an active sense of irony - Richmond Valentine killed 400 million people. One of them was Harry. Now, Eggsy finds himself in 1988, and Harry is alive, and Eggsy\u2019s plan quite simply is this; keep Harry that way, no matter what.\nThe 400 million other people he\u2019ll also save are really just icing.\nAnd so, Eggsy needs to get into the Kingsman.\nAnd then, as luck would have it, as if fate itself is smiling on him, Tristan ends up dead, and Arthur needs a candidate and well, never let it be said that Eggsy is not an opportunist.\nBesides, Arthur valued self preservation above all things. Eggsy\u2019s got an...angle he thinks will work with good old Chester.\n\u201cChester King,\u201d Eggsy says to him in greeting, seating himself across from him uninvited in the little cafe that Chester is in, offering his own fake name with a confident smile, \u201cGary Ward,\u201d because he finally got around to watching Pretty Woman, and Doolittle would be too fucking obvious.\nSo much of him begins and ends with Harry. It\u2019s only fair his name does as well, Eggsy thinks.\n\u201cHave we met?\u201d Chester asks, with the false indulgence of someone who knows the answer already, and Eggsy smiles at him in kind, blandly, but eyes just a little bit too sharp, because Eggsy isn\u2019t the man he was the last time they met, and Chester King is little match for the man he is now.\n\"A couple decades from now, actually, so you needn\u2019t worry about not remembering,\u201d Eggsy says casually, gesturing to the waitress and ordering a cup of tea with a smooth smile and a wink that flusters her before turning back to Arthur and...spinning the truth just a little bit, \u201cYou were...personally responsible for making sure I became a knight.\u201d\nKilling Arthur, after all, was his very own special \u2018last test.\u2019\nArthur raises an eyebrow at that, but Eggsy thinks its less his claim to be from the future and more that Eggsy certainly doesn\u2019t quite match the ideal of what Chester seemed to look for in proposals; namely blue blood and a classist attitude to match his own. Still, for all that Eggsy is sure that Chester suspects he is less than what he appears, he also takes satisfaction in the fact that he can\u2019t prove it, because Eggsy truly has refined himself into the model of a true modern gentleman, and the grudging acceptance that he can see of that fact in Chester King\u2019s eyes is the sweetest reward he could ever hope to receive.\nIt\u2019s possible that Eggsy still harbours a few sour grapes where Arthur is concerned.\nStill, that\u2019s besides the point, so Eggsy lets it go and says instead, cagily, \u201cI\u2019ve found myself taking a one way trip to here from 2018, courtesy of a few angels,\u201d because he\u2019d bet his life that Chester King has stuck his fingers into Torchwood and UNIT intel.\n\u201cI see, and now you wish to rejoin the agency in the here and now,\u201d The man says, because Eggsy has excellent instincts, and then, so fucking smug, like he\u2019s humouring Eggsy, \u201cAnd are you going to offer me knowledge of the future as a bribe?\u201d\nWell now, that just won\u2019t do, will it?\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eggsy says, taking in the smug little fucking twist of his face and deciding to see if he can\u2019t wipe that look off as he says causally, as if he is discussing the bloody weather, \u201cBut do I know how you die. Nominate me for the position of Tristan, and I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen that way.\u201d\nAnd then, with a little self satisfied sip of his tea, because Eggsy might be a gentleman, but he thinks even Harry\u2019d of forgiven this one, all things considered, \u201cAnd bribe is such a dirty word. Consider it an...incentive.\u201d\nYou can bet that smug little smirk is no where to be found.\nBut, for all that Chester King was a treacherous snake and a classist prick, even Eggsy had seen that he\u2019d been a brutally pragmatic man. Chester King had sold out his organizations morals and ideals because he\u2019d judged that Valentine was the best way to ensure his own survival, and the fact that they had similar ideals on class had been a side benefit, of that Eggsy is sure.\nChester nominates him as his candidate for Tristan.\nEggsy does love being right.\nThe trials aren\u2019t run by Merlin, but a man in his 60\u2019s who introduces himself as the knight Kay, but other than that, they\u2019re largely the same as Eggsy\u2019d faced before. Accordingly, with that unfair advantage, Eggsy passes every single test with flying colours, and quite cheerfully shoots the dog, another little pug he\u2019s named JB - though this time for James Bond - because Eggsy\u2019s been a Kingsman long enough to know the weight of a gun with blanks in it versus the weight of one with live ammo. Though, in the name of honesty, he\u2019d have shot, Eggsy knows, even if it had been a loaded weapon, and he can\u2019t make himself feel bad about that. He couldn\u2019t kill the dog for the Kingsman, after all, but for Harry, he\u2019d killed a man.\nAnd this, one must never forget, is not for the Kingsman.\n\u201cTristan,\u201d Chester says, grudging admiration on his face as he offers his hand to Eggsy, and Eggsy only smiles, does not gloat, because he is a gentleman as he takes the hand, shakes it once firmly and returns, \u201cArthur.\u201d\nEggsy is a Kingsman, and he can follow this Arthur no matter how little he thinks of him.\nEggsy\u2019s loyalty was never to the king anyways.\n***************************************\nMerlin - the Merlin he knew - it turns out, is actually part of the organization. He\u2019s not in charge\u00a0of training the candidates yet, but rather head of what Eggsy assumes passes as the 1988 equivalent of a tech division. He\u2019s 21 if he\u2019s a day, just as snarky and possessive about his things as his future counterpart, and sporting a full head of black hair.\nSomehow, it\u2019s the hair that throws him.\nStill, Eggsy likes him just as well as his future counterpart, which is a handy thing, because Arthur sends him out on several incredibly dangerous missions back to back, to prove his worth Eggsy is sure, and so Eggsy once again gets to spend a lot of time with Merlin in his ear. The tech in in 1988 is certainly less impressive; communications are once again limited to actual earpieces and transmitting cameras are only an idea that exists in the R&amp;D development, but they still have lighters that are actually grenades and poisonous knives in expensive oxford shoes, so Eggsy gets by just fine.\nHe does, however, exchange his spy glasses for a pair of plain old regular ones with glass lenses, and puts them and his watch away in a safe in his home that only he knows the code to. He doesn\u2019t mind changing the future to save Harry, but he\u2019s wary about introducing tech\u00a0from future into the past, because he\u2019s seen one too many sci-fi movies to think that\u2019s a good idea.\nBesides, the glasses record and keep the last 24 hours on them, and they\u2019re the only video he has of his mother, Gracie and Roxy. Eggsy might be committed to his plan, is really alright with being stuck here so long as it means changing Harry\u2019s future, but that doesn\u2019t mean that sometimes he doesn\u2019t sit in his new home at night and nurse a glass of scotch as he watches his mum get Gracie ready for school and later, Roxy tease him about some thing that had happened on a mission and punch his shoulder lightly.\nHe is happy where he has found himself, but that does not mean there are not things he misses fiercely from his previous life.\nStill, he refuses to let himself dwell on such things, because only unhappiness lives in those thoughts, and so he throws himself into every mission and assignment that Arthur gives him, acing every one, because no matter the time period, Eggsy really is an exemplary Kingsman.\nAccordingly, this is how in Prague he meets Lancelot, Roxy\u2019s predecesor\u2019s predecesor, who is a ginger haired man named Ben. He\u2019s in his mid thirties, with movie star good looks, blue eyes, and a roguish charm.\nHe\u2019s also, to Eggsy\u2019s view, entirely aware of and enjoying his position as the agency bicycle.\nCase in point, their second mission together in Paris.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Lancelot purrs to him, after they have disposed of a particularly nasty drug ring, as he sprawls himself out on the couch beside Eggsy, invitation clear in the very bold hand he runs up Eggsy\u2019s thigh, \u201cArthur\u2019s picks are never as pretty as you.\u201d\nEggsy finds himself taking a ride or two.\nBecause look, Eggsy wasn\u2019t kidding when he realized that he was ready to move on from Harry, and there is a part of him that still means that, still realizes how important that is going to be. Because the Harry that will be proposed for Galahad\u2019s yet to be vacant seat, Eggsy knows, won\u2019t be the Harry he lost, and Eggsy thinks it\u2019d be truly unfair to this Harry if he acted as if he was. The Harry Eggsy had loved and lost had a quarter century on the one that he will meet, twenty five years to become the man that he was, and it would be unproductive to judge the Harry of now by the standards of the Harry of then. The love he has for his Harry will undoubtably colour his interactions with this new Harry, Eggsy knows, but he too also wants to endeavour to be a gentleman and treat him how he deserves; to approach this new Harry as his own man, not as the ghost of someone Eggsy is still chasing.\nSo Eggsy sleeps with Lancelot.\nBecause, well, who better to pass his time with? Lancelot is handsome, easily charming and very attractive. He is, Eggsy discovers, also excellent in bed, and entirely uninterested in any type of emotional strings beyond friends who fuck, making him entirely perfect for Eggsy\u2019s current needs.\nHe\u2019s also, Eggsy thinks, safe, because Lancelot comes with an expiry date. It\u2019s a morbid thought to be sure, but it\u2019s true enough. It\u2019s easier not to get too attached to Lancelot because he knows how this ends, and so Eggsy flirts and fucks around with the man and it\u2019s all light and string free and nonexclusive, and just what Eggsy wants.\nArthur, naturally, doesn\u2019t approve, because contract killing is apparently fine with his moral compass but buggery is beyond the pale, but Eggsy can almost see in his eyes the ruthless pragmatism win out over his moral disgust. The unspoken rule of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u2019 runs quite strong in Chester King\u2019s Kingsman, and that works just fine for Eggsy, who is entirely willing to engage in a little \u2018see no evil.\u2019\nEggsy\u2019s not sure what 2018 would have become, but 1988 and 1989 become the years of contentment. Eggsy starts a new wall of articles, and adds 14 in 1988, and by the end of 1989 he has 27. Arthur, for all that their relationship will never be close nor fond, considers him a successful agent, and Eggsy has a friend that he fucks in Lancelot, and a friend that he most certainly does not fuck in Merlin, and Eggsy feels satisfied with this life he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d live.\nAnd then 1990 rolls around, and Eggsy is 29, and he knows that this will be the year of Harry.\nNeedless to say, he is looking forward to it.\n***************************************\n1990 also brings with it a visitor he never expected to see, in the form of a man in a brown suit\u00a0and chucks and a pretty bottle blonde who stumble into the shop on one of Eggsy\u2019s cover shifts that Arthur makes them all do.\nTo be fair, a tailor who knows nothing about suits would be a terrible cover, Eggsy admits.\nThe girl is very pretty, Eggsy notes, for all that she\u2019s wearing a style of shirt and jeans that won\u2019t be in fashion for another 15 years and when she turns the man, and asks quizzically, \u201cWhat are we doing here? You never change your clothes,\u201d Eggsy can hear the same London lower class accent that he used to have in her voice.\nHe thinks he knows who these two are.\n\u201cRose...\u201d the man gently chides, and Eggsy hides his smirk, because there is a blue police box on the street corner where one wasn\u2019t a few moments ago, and if the Torchwood intel he stole is correct, the girl has a point. However, the man doesn\u2019t get to finish his sentence as he spots Eggsy, and says, rather bluntly, a frown starting to form on his expressive face, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eggsy says very politely, to the alien he knows is called The Doctor, with what he is sure is a cheeky glint in his eye, \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re very clever. The Angels?\u201d The Doctor says, and then before Eggsy can reply, with a dismissive wave of his hand, fast and just this side of manic, \u201cYes, of course it\u2019s the Angels. But you\u2019re not planning to just ride your time out, are you? You\u2019re planning to change things.\u201d\n\u201cJust one thing in particular,\u201d Eggsy says agreeably, because he can\u2019t see any reason in lying to the man whose made a hobby out of changing history just because he can.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never just one thing,\u201d The Doctor says dismissively, shooting a brief look at the girl, who is looking on with some confusion, before returning his gaze to Eggsy to accuse, \u201cYou humans, all so bright but you never stop to consider the consequences of your actions.\u201d\nEggsy\u2019d mention that he\u2019s considered them and simply doesn\u2019t care, but honestly, he feels like that might be splitting hairs.\n\u201cPlease, feel free to enlighten me,\u201d Eggsy says instead, and it is a genuine entreaty. Eggsy\u2019s committed to doing this no matter what happens to him or the world, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to actually know the possible outcomes, and this happens to be the only man in the world who could tell him them.\n\u201cThe universe is all about it\u2019s checks and balances,\u201d The Doctor informs him, amping up in intensity as he warms to the topic, \u201cYou keep enough in the black, integrate yourself into this timeline deep enough, then maybe you create an alternative timeline, separate from your original and you\u2019re fine, you get to stay.\u201d\nAnd then, changing direction, the warning clear in those paradoxically old eyes, \u201cBut you if you don\u2019t, if you find yourself still stuck in your original timeline, then you\u2019re a paradox, and the universe wipes you out - you just fade away. Is your one thing worth that risk?\u201d The Doctor finishes, and for all that Eggsy imagines he thinks he\u2019s just delivered bad news, Eggsy\u2019s honestly pretty pleased, because the two alternatives are both ones he can live with so long as Harry lives too.\nSo Eggsy simply looks at the girl, and then back to The Doctor and asks, because this is the fastest way to explain the sheer magnitude of what Harry meant to him, \u201cIs yours?\u201d\nWhen The Doctor has to break their eye contact to look at his dirty white chucks, Eggsy knows he\u2019s got it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it 400 million lives,\u201d Eggsy says quietly instead, and means every single word, \u201cI just want one in return. And he\u2019s worth those 400 million to me,\u201d and then politely, but also entirely rhetorical, \u201cDoes that answer your question?\u201d\nHe thinks, in those too ancient eyes, he might see the light of approval.\n\u201cSo no, thank you,\u201d Eggsy says politely, because this is the only way he can have Harry be alive, and at least now he knows that if he succeeds his mum and Gracie and Roxy will still be out there somewhere, and he knows they\u2019ll be alright without him, \u201cI won\u2019t be needing that ride you\u2019re thinking of offering me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably making a mistake,\u201d The Doctor warns him, and Eggsy says only, \u201cIt\u2019s mine to make,\u201d and not, for him, no I\u2019m not, because it would be truly ungentlemanly to preach to this man in particular on the lengths one is willing to go for someone they love.\nAnd then, he turns his attention to the pretty blonde The Doctor called Rose they\u2019ve been unintentionally ignoring, and notes that he can see as clear as day that she\u2019s in love with The Doctor. And since he can\u2019t help but feel sympathy for her for that, Eggsy takes one of the long-stemmed roses out of the tall vase on the counter and offers it to her with a flourish and a wink, \u201cA rose, for a lovely Rose,\u201d\nEggsy has time to notice that she is especially pretty when she blushes, before The Doctor is herding her away with what sounds like a jealous, \u201cYou and your pretty boys.\u201d\nJust before they clear the door Rose throws back over her shoulder a \u201cThank you,\u201d tongue tucked cheekily between her teeth and Eggsy looks at the millennia old alien painfully smitten with a twenty year old London girl, and reminds himself that there are, in fact, love stories more tragic than his own.\nAnd so Eggsy watches his only chance at getting back to his own time shuffle his pretty blonde back into his big blue police box of a time travelling space ship, watches it until it has wheezed and faded away.\nAnd then he gets back to the business of folding pocket squares. It is 1990, and in a matter of months a young Harry Hart will be proposed as a candidate for the position of Galahad.\nHe\u2019s exactly where he wants to be.\n***************************************\nEggsy, for all that he had scoured Harry\u2019s old Kingsman records, doesn\u2019t remember exactly the\u00a0date and the circumstances under which the current Galahad bit the bullet, so to speak. That would be why he isn\u2019t expecting Lancelot to come out of the bathroom of the hotel room they\u2019re sharing in Monaco after taking down a small terrorist organization and announce solemnly, \u201cGalahad is dead. We\u2019ve been called into HQ, to present our candidates and help with the training.\u201d\nEggsy\u2019s been waiting for what feels like forever for this moment.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Eggsy says, and kisses Lancelot for what he knows will be the last time, because for all that he has enjoyed his time with the man, with Harry so close it is undeniably over, \u201cWe\u2019d better go then.\u201d\nHarry is waiting for him.\n***************************************\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Lancelot says in greeting when they make it back to the English HQ, and Merlin looks up from his clipboard and returns, with a gesture towards the two way mirror, \u201cTristan, Lancelot. Fresh new crowd.\u201d\nAnd so Eggsy makes himself look casually through at the young men gathered there, tries not to let the fact that his heart is currently in his throat show as he scans the group. He notices his own candidate, a marine he notified from the plane to show up, a perfectly nice young man that Eggsy knows will pull his parachute too soon because of a pathological fear of heights talking to the plant for the training, a spotty faced man from the tech department.\nAnd then he catches sight of the young man standing in the middle of the room, all soft cheeks and brown eyes and fluffy chestnut hair, so painfully young and beautiful and his heart does one long, slow roll in his chest.\nHarry.\nThat fuck, he\u2019s adorable is the only thought running through Eggsy\u2019s mind right now is...understandable, he decides, staring that those cheeks that he can\u2019t decide if he wants to pinch or bite.\nHe was prepared to see Harry alive again.\nHe absolutely not prepared for this level of fucking cuteness.\n\u201cMy word, who proposed the one with the hair?\u201d Lancelot says, pulling Eggsy out of his rather unabashed staring of said hair, which thankfully has seemed to have gone unnoticed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Merlin fires back, because Lancelot\u2019s hair related vanity is well known in the Kingsman circles, before he flips through a few sheets and then reads off one of them, \u201cHarry Hart, 25, Belvedere\u2019s proposal. RAF, excellent scores in all of their training reports, nothing but glowing reviews from his superiors.\u201d\n...Eggsy is absolutely not plotting on how to get his hands on a picture of Harry in his dress uniform.\n\u201cThe puppies look like they\u2019re more dangerous then him,\u201d Lancelot returns, teasingly dismissive, and Eggsy can kind of see where he\u2019s coming from with that, because this Harry is all soft and unsure, with none of the smooth confidence and lethal polish that his Harry\u2019d had.\nNaturally, he still makes an unfairly appealing sight.\n\u201cI think he might surprise you,\u201d is all Eggsy says, trying for casual, but something in his tone must give him away because Lancelot turns to him with a glint in his eyes that Eggsy knows never spells out good things.\nThe last time he\u2019d seen that look Lancelot had shot down a helicopter with a fucking\u00a0handgun and Eggsy\u2019d had to parkour his way over a moving truck to avoid getting hit by damn thing as it fell.\nLancelot, in case he hasn\u2019t mentioned it before, is fucking nuts.\n\u201cTristan is playing favourites already I see,\u201d Lancelot announces, with an air of devilish delight, because that look never lies and there\u2019s nothing he loves more than being a fucking wanker, \u201cAnd with the prettiest one no less.\u201d\n\u201cOh, go soak your overly groomed head,\u201d Eggsy fires back, instead of the you have no idea he wants to say, and Lancelot reels over-dramatically, placing his hands over his heart and pasting a terribly false look of offence on his face.\nArsehole, Eggsy thinks with some fondness.\n\u201cGentlemen, as fun as this is, one of you does have to go in and give the speech,\u201d Merlin says dryly, peering up over his clipboard at them unimpressed, because despite time travel, some things apparently never change.\nIt is, as always, a strangely comforting thought.\n\u201cTristan can do it, impress his pretty boy with the hair,\u201d Lancelot decrees, batting his lashes at Eggsy outrageously, and Eggsy, in a gesture much more suited for the chav he once was, gives him a two fingered salute.\nLancelot, because he is a shameless fucker, only laughs delightedly.\nEggsy, because he\u2019s a gentleman, just takes the high road and goes in to give the speech. It is only, he reasons, half because he wants to stare at Harry some more, which he thinks is fair, given how long he\u2019s waited.\nHonestly, the other half is that he really wants to give this speech. The draw of being on the other side, and all that.\nIt\u2019s kind of a badass speech, after all.\nAnd so Eggsy walks into the room he was twice a trainee in, and stares at all these young faces that wish to be Kingsman, and the one he knows will actually succeed, and starts the speech.\n\u201cI am the agent codenamed Tristan, and you all are about to embark,\u201d Eggsy drawls, looking these oh so young faces who stare back at him completely absorbed in what he\u2019s saying, \u201cOn the most dangerous job interview of your lives.\u201d\nAnd then he makes the mistake of looking at Harry, whose looking at Eggsy like he\u2019s utterly enraptured, and Eggsy\u2019s hands practically twitch with the urge to run his hands through that bloody hair, to see if he couldn\u2019t make this boy version of Harry purr.\nHe is so fucked.\n***************************************\nThe players, for your viewing pleasure.\nEggsy Unwin/Gary Ward/Tristan - 29\n\n\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t he just a suave little bugger?\nHarry Hart/Galahad - 25\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but look at that hair. That hair is that big because it is hiding the secrets of how to steadily get hotter with age from all the rest of us poor mortals.\nMerlin - 23\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding pictures of young Mark Strong with hair is a lot more difficult than I thought. Ignore the pilot shirt.\nBen/Lancelot - mid to late thirties\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, let's be honest, you were already imaging him as Ben!Lancelot, weren\u2019t you.\n***************************************\n\u00a0\n***************************************\nThe Doctor: River, you and I, we know what this means. We are ground zero of an explosion that will engulf all reality. Billions and billions will suffer and die. \nRiver: I'll suffer if I have to kill you. \nThe Doctor: More than every living thing in the universe? \nRiver: Yes. \n\u2014 The Doctor and River Song\n***************************************\nHarry Hart at 25, Eggsy comes to realize quickly, is a profoundly different animal than Harry Hart\u00a0at 50. And it isn\u2019t like he wasn't aware that this would be the case before, had psyched himself up for this, but now, staring at the reality of it, it really is incredibly apparent. Harry at 50 had been all hard smooth polished edges and absolute confidence in his skills and his position in life. The Harry that stands before him now is shyer, softer, less confident in himself - more deferential, where his older self had been more assertive.\nStill, it isn\u2019t that they\u2019re bad changes, and they certainly don\u2019t make Harry less, just...different.\nThe sight of him shirtless as he punches his way through the two way mirror to drain the room of water and save all his fellow candidates is also...really very nice.\nThe fact that he lets Lancelot give the \u201cyou failed at teamwork and check out that totally drowned person,\u201d speech might be related to the erection that he\u2019s currently sporting.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Eggsy really likes this Harry.\nAnd then, as if he wasn\u2019t already drowning in fucking cuteness, apparently Mr. Pickles started out as the runt of the litter because Harry picks the tiniest puppy as his dog, and Eggsy gets to watch him cradle it in his hands and let the little thing lick his face.\nEggsy might die. He\u2019s given it some serious thought. It\u2019s possible the adorableness might kill him, where drug cartels and terrorists and megalomaniacal psychopaths have failed.\nThe boy and his puppy were too cute, it will read on his tombstone, Eggsy thinks, under his fake name.\n\u201cMr. Pickles,\u201d Lancelot drawls mercilessly, because Lancelot has decided that Eggsy\u2019s infatuation with Harry is just fucking darling, and Eggsy decides he won\u2019t allow himself to die of the cuteness only if to not give Lancelot the satisfaction.\nThe principal of the thing, and all that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just annoyed because he\u2019s prettier than you,\u201d Eggsy shoots back waspishly, barely looking up from the written candidate tests he\u2019s grading, where naturally Harry has scored the highest again.\nHe is the best candidate, and even without his knowledge of the future, Eggsy can see that Harry was born to be a Kingsman knight.\nIt is, like Merlin\u2019s eternal and timeless snark, a comforting thought.\nLancelot, who Eggsy is pretty sure is supposed to be overseeing the target practice trials right about now, naturally ignores the quip and, after pouring himself and Eggsy both a generous sniffer full of brandy, sprawls himself out on the leather settee drawls, satisfied gleam in his eye, \u201cSo I am right, you do have your eye on him.\u201d\nEggsy intends to change the actual course of history for Harry. Needless to say, he\u2019d like to have more than just his eyes on him.\nYou can bet he\u2019s not telling Lancelot that though.\n\u201cGiven how uncomfortable he is every time you sneak up behind me and cop a feel,\u201d Eggsy says, shooting him a chastising look over the sniffer that bounces off Lancelot like rubber, \u201cI don't imagine it\u2019ll be something that I\u2019ll have to worry about.\u201d\nTo be fair, the flirting Lancelot does with him in front of the candidates is only partially because he\u2019s a handsy wanker. The other part is actually strategic, because homophobia is acceptable - and certainly by Arthur himself preferred - in Chester King\u2019s Kingsman, right up until the part where it might interfere with a mission. Arthur\u2019s ideal knight is one who would never actively seek out gay interactions, but also wouldn\u2019t falter if a mission called for it, and so the candidates\u00a0are screened rather discretely for what Eggsy disdainfully thinks of as \u2018the proper balance of homophobia.\u2019\nOccasionally, Eggsy thinks with great fondness on the sound Chester King made as he choked and died.\nWithin those - truly offensive - guidelines though, Harry\u2019s reaction is perfectly acceptable. There\u2019s no disgust in his eyes, Eggsy is relieved to see, no moral outrage or pearl clutching, like there is with one of the posh wanker Oxford boys Eggsy\u2019ll be all too glad to send home because he\u2019s soundly failed his written exam. Harry\u2019s just...uncomfortable whenever Lancelot\u2019s hands linger on Eggsy a little too long, looks away with a truly appealing flush on his cheeks that Eggsy is hard pressed to read as anything other than \u2018embarrassed straight boy.\u2019\nEggsy\u2019d have bet his left testicle that the Harry of 2015 was at least bi - \u201cpopping cherries\u201d his fucking arse - but this is not that Harry. This is the Harry of 1990, where heteronormativity and homophobia run rampant, and so \u2018embarrassed straight boy\u2019 is honestly probably one of the best outcomes Eggsy could have hoped for.\nIt\u2019s not much help to his persistent erection though.\n\u201cTo pretty straight boys,\u201d Lancelot says, unaware of Eggsy\u2019s inner musings, proposing a cheeky toast, which Eggsy returns in kind, before Lancelot unfolds himself off the couch and asks, with a wink, \u201cWant to come see if your pretty boy can shoot?\u201d\nHe does.\nAnd naturally, of course Harry can, and really fucking well.\nAt least being aroused by Harry\u2019s sheer competence is too somehow, strangely comforting.\n***************************************\nThey\u2019re down to five by the time the parachute test rolls around, after losing two to the written\u00a0exam - including Arthur\u2019s pouncy twat of a candidate, a thought that brings Eggsy more joy than it should - and and one to the marksmanship tests. As such, the field is now made up of Harry, Lancelot and Eggsy\u2019s own picks, and two more posh private school boy types that Eggsy has taken to calling \u2018Charlie\u2019s\u2019 in the privacy of his own head.\nAh, Charlie. Punching him in the face still remains a fond memory.\nStill, Eggsy figures they\u2019ll lose two more with the parachute test, and his money is on one of the Charlie\u2019s and his own pick, because Eggsy\u2019d chose him solely for this reason to give Harry a better shot at the seat.\nCan\u2019t hurt to stack the deck, after all.\nHowever, his candidate also hasn\u2019t made his fear of heights a secret, and that nervousness comes over the coms clearly to Eggsy, Merlin and Lancelot who are watching on the monitors, prompting a probing look from Lancelot as the candidates make the jump.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve picked a candidate you knew was going to fail,\u201d Lancelot muses slowly, ever sharp, as they watch the little dots plummet towards the earth on the monitor and, sure enough, Eggsy\u2019s marine panics and pulls far too soon, before Merlin\u2019s even delivered the hook.\n\u201cHave I now?\u201d Eggsy says, a little enigmatic smile on his face as Merlin decrees over the comms that if, for example, one of your group had no parachute, and Lancelot only shakes his head and decrees bemusedly, as one of the Charlie\u2019s panics the fuck out and is generally useless, \u201cYou\u2019re a strange one Tristan.\u201d\nGiven that this conversation is taking place nearly a year before Eggsy is even born, he thinks that might be a bit of an understatement.\n\u201cAlways, Lancelot,\u201d Eggsy says, to the sound of Harry making a plan for the candidates to pull their chutes in pairs, a satisfied smile on his face.\nHe wonders if Harry\u2019d felt this way, seeing himself in Eggsy the way Eggsy sees himself now in Harry.\nThis time travel thing is some Inception level shite sometimes, Eggsy muses with a smirk.\nThe useless Charlie misses the target by at least 10 yards, while other Charlie, Lancelot\u2019s candidate and Harry all land in it, under the radar line. And Eggsy\u2019s got this plan of going up and maybe putting a congratulatory hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, because the sight of him all flushed with adrenaline and victory is a temptation too strong for the likes of Eggsy, when the useless Charlie stars whining about the trouble they\u2019ll be in when his father hears about this, and yeah, Eggsy just can't resist.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t talk to me like that,\u201d Eggsy purrs lethally, putting on his best I\u2019ve killed better men than you before breakfast eyes as he...borrows another line from Merlin, because yeah, Merlin had all the best quips, \u201cYou have something to say to me, you come up to me and you whisper it in my ear.\u201d\nHe takes great satisfaction in the fact that the boy is too weak to come up to him and do so.\nAnd then he walks up to Harry, whose looking at him with rewardingly wide eyes, and gives him a solid shoulder squeeze and a warm, \u201cGood work,\u201d and then strolls away without a second look, just because he can.\nAnd that, Eggsy thinks, remembering with fondness a police station three decades from now, is how you make an exit.\n\u201cHave I mentioned you\u2019re a sight when you\u2019re like that, all lethal and sexy?\u201d Lancelot drawls as Eggsy makes his way past him on the stairs, falling in step with him and shooting him a look that Eggsy might best describe as indecent, \u201cThose poor boys could hardly handle it, especially your boy.\u201d\nHe\u2019s mentioned Lancelot\u2019s an arsehole, right?\n\u201cYou need to have your eyes checked Lancelot,\u201d Eggsy says, because for all he\u2019d like to believe that\u2019s true, Harry still ducks his head whenever Lancelot comes within 10 feet of him, which isn\u2019t the most inspiring sign of interest.\nThe sight of Harry blushing, at least, remains as appealing as ever.\n\u201cLancelot needs to have his brain checked,\u201d Merlin says dryly, falling into step with them, and then to Eggsy, over the sound of Lancelot spluttering over-dramatically in faux offence, \u201cStill, I might steal that line one day.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Eggsy says magnanimously, because Eggsy too is, occasionally, an arsehole, \u201cFeel free.\u201d\nMan\u2019s gotta have a little fun in life, after all.\n***************************************\nNo matter the time period, Eggsy decides, getting almost blown up still sucks balls.\nWaking up in the infirmary wing afterwards is no fun either: still, he makes himself do a inventory, as he always does in situation\u2019s like this. Emergency mission in Mumbai that called him away from the training? Check. Cartel dispatched, hostages retrieved? Check. Bungled extraction resulting in him nearly getting blown the fuck up?\nCheck, Eggsy thinks with a wince, taking in the bandages on his chest likely concealing a burn or two, and lingering headache he\u2019s got from colliding with the ground after getting flung through the air from the IED explosion.\nA boyishly adorable Harry and his dog curled up, dozing on the bed beside his arm? Check.\nWait, what?\nBut no, Eggsy discovers, his eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on him, because yes, that is absolutely Harry and Mr. Pickles sleeping at his fucking hospital bedside, and Harry\u2019s all tousled hair and the innocent, open face of the slumbering, and if Eggsy wasn\u2019t dying before he absolutely is now.\nEggsy\u2019s hand literally twitches with how much he wants to run a hand through that bloody hair.\nHe is so fucked.\n\u201cAnd here I was worried about you being lonely down here,\u201d drawls a voice that most assuredly belongs to Lancelot, and Harry startles awake violently at it. Then he mumbles some apology with his eyes firmly fixed on his feet, gathers his dog and disappears from the room so fast Eggsy\u2019s surprised there isn\u2019t a little cartoon trail of smoke left in his wake.\nLancelot, Eggsy thinks sourly, is an arsehole with awful fucking timing.\n\u201cYou know, I feel like he might not be as straight as originally thought,\u201d Lancelot says musingly, shite eating grin on his face, as he takes the seat beside Eggsy\u2019s bed and props his legs obnoxiously on the side of Eggsy\u2019s bed.\nGiven that right now Eggsy\u2019s greatest desire is to go after Harry, pin him to the nearest wall, stick his hands in that hair and snog him until they both can\u2019t walk straight, Eggsy can only hope he\u2019s right.\n\u201cGet away from me,\u201d Eggsy grumps, shoving half-heartedly at Lancelot\u2019s feet instead, because there is a thing as revealing too much and Eggsy\u2019s dangerously close to that line. Thankfully, he\u2019s saved by the appearance of Merlin, who wanders in with his favoured clipboard, prompting Eggsy to ask the only partially inane, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI have a medical degree?\u201d Merlin responds dryly, and then, at Eggsy\u2019s raised eyebrow - because Merlin might have a medical degree, but Eggsy\u2019s mostly fine and Merlin\u2019s no sitting at your bedside type, so he\u2019s certainly not here just because of that - he capitulates and admits his actual reason for being there as he says, with a shrug, \u201cBelvedere\u2019s been called away on an emergency evacuation in Beruit. Arthur wants you take over his candidate until he\u2019s back.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the Merlin he knows.\n\u201cOh, Tristan shouldn\u2019t have any problem \u2018taking over\u2019 with his pretty boy,\u201d Lancelot practically\u00a0purrs\u00a0loquaciously, waggling his eyebrows outrageously at Eggsy.\nAnd there\u2019s the Lancelot he knows.\n\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Eggsy shoots back, and resists the ever tempting urge to flip him off, because Eggsy is, in fact, a gentleman.\n\u201cYou offering?\u201d Lancelot teases, blinking his eyes in a coltish parody and Merlin, in the periphery looks like he\u2019d be fine if they both got hit by lightening and Eggsy realizes, quite suddenly that this is his life. That trading quips with Lancelot, getting snarked at by Merlin, saving the day and nearly getting blown up, and a young man with distracting hair that means with world to him have become his new normal. That here, in a time that should be alien to him, he\u2019s found a place, carved out a life here that now he can\u2019t imagine not having.\nThis is his life, and he loves it.\n***************************************\nThere\u2019s probably a special hell, Eggsy thinks, for people who contemplate having sex with\u00a0someone tied to railroad tracks only seconds after they realize they didn\u2019t die.\nHarry is panting from adrenaline, flushed, hair windswept and mussed from the train, and his voice is a little hoarse from shouting about how he\u2019s never heard of Kingsman, or anyone called Tristan.\nWorth it, Eggsy decides, and then makes himself push that thought away and gets down to the business of cutting Harry free, and throws in a \u201cBloody well done,\u201d for good measure, because he can.\nThe appealing flush of pride on Harry\u2019s cheeks is just an added bonus.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Belvedere got called away and you\u2019re stuck with me for the next 24 hours,\u201d he continues, to Harry\u2019s questioning look, a little bit apologetic, because Harry\u2019s been doing his level best to pretend that the whole infirmary scene hadn\u2019t happened at all and so Eggsy imagines that this probably isn\u2019t news he wants to hear, despite Eggsy\u2019s own feelings on it.\nOr, Eggsy\u2019s really in quite close proximately to Harry right now, cutting him off these tracks, and also very glad the cut of his suit jacket is so long, is all he\u2019s saying. He hasn\u2019t been this perpetually aroused since...\nWell, to be fair, the last time he was training with Harry, Eggsy thinks with some amusement.\n\u201cNo sir, that\u2019s quite...alright,\u201d Harry says, all earnest enthusiasm as he rubs his freed wrists to return circulation, and Eggsy curls his hands into his pockets so he doesn\u2019t reach out and offer to help. And then Eggsy finds himself wondering, great, now what the fuck do I do, because Harry\u2019d just taken him to his home for those 24 hours, but Eggsy\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s standard operating procedure or not.\nHe feels like the answer is probably not.\nSo fuck it, after Merlin finishes the last two candidate debrief - Harry and Lancelot's candidate, because the second Charlie folded like a house of cards when confronted with the idea of 'death by train' - Eggsy invites Harry to his home, because Eggsy\u2019s never been much for the rules anyways, and it\u2019s all worth it when Harry accepts with this little smile on his face that Eggsy thinks he\u2019d move mountains for.\nIt\u2019s only 24 hours, he reminds himself. It\u2019ll be fine.\n***************************************\n This, Eggsy decides, watching Harry as he looks at his wall of articles, standing in his home like\u00a0he belongs there, was a terrible idea.\nBecause, Eggsy realizes, quite suddenly, that he\u2019s looking at Harry and not seeing two Harry\u2019s, not the Harry of then and now, but rather, just Harry. And that, the Harry he sees, is the Harry he wants. He doesn\u2019t want the Harry of now because of what he will become; he just wants Harry, whose deep brown eyes shine at him, whose hair tempts Eggsy\u2019s hands no matter if it is sleek and tamed or fly away and fluffy. Harry, who has always looked at him like no one else has, and Harry, who is the only person whose ever made him feel such tension from just a movement or a look.\nEggsy realizes that the man he\u2019s been calling this Harry has really just been Harry all along.\nHe\u2019s Harry, and Eggsy loves him.\nQuite a day for epiphanies, Eggsy thinks, looking towards his liquor cabinet with a certain longing.\nAnd Harry, just Harry, the Harry he loves is looking at him, and Eggsy wants so many things.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d Eggsy says, to that shyly inquisitive face, grasping at the familiar as a defence against letting slip all the things he\u2019d like to ask, to have of Harry, \u201cYou\u2019d like to learn how to make a gentleman\u2019s martini?\u201d\n\u201cYes please sir,\u201d Harry says, all earnest enthusiasm, looking up at him with those damn wide eyes, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t fuck Harry over his desk is truly a testament to Eggsy\u2019s self restraint.\nThe night ends with Eggsy bundling a flushed, tipsy Harry into his guest room, and if he runs a hand through that silky soft hair as he pulls the covers up, soft and reverential, he thinks ever saints would forgive him the temptation.\nIn the morning, Eggsy makes eggs and toast for a still sleep foggy Harry, whose hair sticks up in adorable tuffs, and they eat in comfortable silence.\nEggsy cannot think of a moment where he\u2019s ever been happier.\n***************************************\nHarry shoots the dog, because Harry is a Kingsman, and Harry was always going to shoot the\u00a0dog.\nEggsy thinks now, actually, might be the happiest he\u2019s ever been.\n\u201cGalahad,\u201d Eggsy says, offering his hand to their newest knight, and after five years of being a Kingsman, in a time weeks before he\u2019s even born and both five years after and twenty-five years before Harry\u2019s death, Eggsy finally gets to shake Harry\u2019s hand as an equal, Kingsman to Kingsman.\n\u201cTristan,\u201d Harry says, taking it, flushed with pride and smiling oh so beautifully, and in that moment, Harry\u2019s hand in his, everything is alright in Eggsy\u2019s world.\n***************************************\nArthur, Eggsy\u2019d just like it known, is a fucking cunt.\nSee, the thing about Arthur is; he\u2019s not bad at his job. Eggsy can admit that freely and without prejudice; Chester King has a knack for pragmatism, a skill for appropriate delegation, and the slick, smooth talking skills needed to play the politics implied in running an international clandestine spy agency.\nUnfortunately, Chester King also has quite the streak of ruthlessness in him, and that combined with his utter distain for what he perceives as weakness is what\u2019s causing a problem right now. Because apparently it didn\u2019t just come to Lancelot's and Eggsy\u2019s attention that Harry\u2019d been uncomfortable around their flirting, but Arthur\u2019s as well, and Arthur\u2019s the kind of bloke that likes to find a person\u2019s weak spot and then just press down there until you flinch.\nSo, after a few solo missions to ease the new Galahad in, Arthur sends them on a mission to the favourite gay club of a corrupt Russian politician, where the plan is to have Harry and Eggsy pose as a couple looking for a third, lure him up to their room and knock him out and steal the codes he has.\nOr, in other words, Arthur smells a weakness in his newest knight, and so he wants to see what Harry will do when told to sit on Eggsy\u2019s lap and writhe, because Arthur is, once again, a fucking cunt.\nHarry, standing in their hotel room in Russia, looks so bloody uncomfortable, barely able to meet Eggsy\u2019s gaze.\nChester King, Eggsy thinks, not for the first time, died far too quickly.\nStill, they do have a job to do, and so, although Eggsy\u2019d prefer to have this conversation the first of never, he clears his throat for Harry\u2019s attention and begins, as levelly as he can, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to work this mission, I feel like we might want to...clear the air so to speak.\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d Harry asks, looking more liked a trapped rabbit than a man who just last week single handedly took out a drug cartel, and Eggsy takes another second to cast aspirations on the state of Arthur\u2019s parents martial status at the time of his conception.\nCunt bastard.\n\u201cGary if you please, Tristan if you must,\u201d Eggsy says, instead of, if you keep calling me sir in that\u00a0tone I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions, \u201cBut never sir - you\u2019re a knight now, an equal.\u201d\nAnd then, getting back on topic he continues, as diplomatically as he can, trying to infuse a non- judgemental air into his tone to set Harry at ease, \u201cI, and Arthur, to be sure, couldn\u2019t help but notice how...uncomfortable this sort of thing between Lancelot and I made you during the training.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn't that!\u201d Harry protests passionately in response, \u201cIt was...\u201d and then he loses momentum and trails off, looking down with what looks like embarrassment at his oxfords, and Eggsy feels a wave of fondness wash over him, because Harry really is such a good hearted man.\n\u201cIt really is alright, you can\u2019t help the way you feel,\u201d Eggsy says, and he really does mean it, because Harry\u2019s a product of his environment as much as anyone else is, and he\u2019s still the greatest man Eggsy\u2019s ever met, \u201cI\u2019m really not offended.\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir!\u201d Harry exclaims loudly, looking frankly as horrified as Eggsy\u2019s ever seen him, standing practically at attention by the window.\n\u201cGalahad, what did I just say about - \u201d Eggsy says, running on auto pilot, because it\u2019s easier than confronting their actual problem, and perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s so startled by the abrupt appearance of Harry in his personal space, and the sudden, shocking wet warmth of Harry\u2019s mouth on his.\nAnd it\u2019s clumsy and sloppy, a little too much teeth and Harry clearly doesn\u2019t know how to angle his head, because their noses bump together, and it\u2019s over before it can really even begin.\nAnd yet...it\u2019s Harry kissing him.\nIt\u2019s perfect.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Eggsy says stupidly, staring at Harry, Harry who just kissed him with what he\u2019s sure is\u00a0something akin to stunned wonder, as he finally gets it, \u201cOh I see. You were jealous.\u201d\n\u201cYes s - Tristan,\u201d Harry says, looking miserable, and he can\u2019t even feel sorry for that, because the sheer wave of joy that seems to permeating ever cell of his body won\u2019t let him. Because now he knows that all those looks, all those flushes and smiles were Harry wanting him, and Eggsy thinks he might not ever be anything other than happy again.\n\u201cYou had no reason to be,\u201d Eggsy says, knowing no truer words have ever been spoken, before he continues, more serious than before, because this is something they need to clarify before anything else happens, \u201cLancelot and I\u2019s relationship is most assuredly over. However, it was also entirely free of strings, not exclusive. Is that what you are looking for here?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says, to Eggsy\u2019s great relief, with growing confidence. And so Eggsy finally gives into the temptation that\u2019s been plaguing him for months, and threads his hands through that damned hair, uses it to guide Harry\u2019s face to his so he can whisper teasingly onto Harry\u2019s wanting lips, \u201cGood, me neither. I find myself wanting exclusivity and all kinds of strings with you.\u201d\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Harry says, sounded somewhat dazed and stunned, and yeah, that\u2019s it for Eggsy\u2019s self restraint as he takes that oh so tempting mouth in a kiss that certainly isn\u2019t gentlemanly, nibbling in and then conquering, a play of teeth and tongue that leaves them both breathless.\nHarry, he\u2019s pleased to discover, is a bloody natural at kissing.\n\u201cIs this your first time with a man?\u201d Eggsy asks, pushing Harry down gently onto the bed behind them, and taking a second to admire the picture he makes there, all wild hair from Eggsy\u2019s hands and slick, swollen lips from his kisses. And then, once he\u2019s looked his fill, he crawls lithely over him to rest on his hands and knees, and gets to the business of finally getting a look at that cock that\u2019s occupied far too much of his thoughts already.\nHarrys gasps, so prettily as Eggsy gets his hand around his prick, already hard and weeping, and it\u2019s a sight that doesn\u2019t disappoint, because Harry\u2019s a nice big boy, uncut with a nice wide head that makes Eggsy\u2019s mouth water from wanting it.\nAnd then Harry stutters out a \u201cYe - yes,\u201d in answer to his question, and Eggsy\u2019s cock, which was already hard enough to pound nails with gets impossibly harder at knowledge that he\u2019s the only one who has ever had the privilege of doing this to Harry, that he gets to be the first\u00a0man who does this to him.\nEggsy thinks he might owe those angels a fruit basket or something.\n\u201cI won\u2019t fuck you here,\u201d Eggsy purrs, freeing his own cock and fisting their erections together, savouring the velvet warmth Harry\u2019s cock pressed against his own as he starts jacking them both off lazily. \u201cI\u2019ll wait, until we have all the time in the world. Until I can savour you the way you deserve.\u201d And then, with greater intensity, now fucking shallowly into the cradle of his hand, a\u00a0move that Harry mimics with desperate, stuttering thrusts, eyes huge as Eggsy keeps whispering his fifth in his ears, \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll lay you out on my sheets, and find every single spot that makes you gasp and shudder and moan, until my name is the only word you can remember.\u201d And then Eggsy finishes lowly, combining a little nip to the meat of Harry\u2019s ear with a flick of his wrist that never fails, \u201cAnd maybe then, when you\u2019re beyond even begging for it, I\u2019ll finally fuck you.\u201d\nThe sight of Harry desperate, panting and shuddering as he comes all over Eggsy\u2019s hand and ridiculously expensive bespoke trousers, is most one of the most beautiful he\u2019s ever seen. Naturally, it\u2019s that sight that pushes him over the edge, orgasm bursting from his spine to sweep him under, and if his trousers weren\u2019t ruined before, they certainly are by the time Eggsy\u2019s finished coming.\nHe was due for a new suit anyways, Eggsy thinks with a mental shrug, and then makes with the business of grabbing a few tissues from the beside table to try and elevate the worst of the wet spot.\nHarry\u2019s appealing post-sex lethargy makes easy work out of the clean up, and so Eggsy tosses the soiled tissues and then crawls up to lay beside Harry, bodies turned towards each other and head to head on the same pillow, close enough to share breath. Eggsy amuses himself with running his fingers over the smooth, soft lines of Harry\u2019s face, memorizing him, and Harry leans only further into it, practically purring under the attention. \u201cGary,\u201d Harry tries out, clearly testing the word on his tongue, and finding it lacking, if the little frown that appears on his face is any indication. And Eggsy gets it, because he\u2019s never liked it, and it has the added downside of making them Harry and Gary and yeah, no.\n\u201cI would very much like it if, when it\u2019s just the two of us, you\u2019d call me Eggsy,\u201d Eggsy says softly, running his thumb over those puffy, kiss swollen lips, because in this one way he wants to he selfish, to have Harry call him his name and damn the consequences, \u201cIt\u2019s a...nickname from my past I\u2019ve missed hearing.\u201d\n\u201cEggsy,\u201d Harry says, smiling at the sound of it, and Eggsy sighs out only \u201cHarry,\u201d and then he can\u2019t help but close the tiny distance between them kiss him, soft and sweet, because finally.\nNeedless to say, they ace the mission.\n\u201cThe...issue has been quite...worked out, I assure you,\u201d Eggsy drawls, with a smirk over his sniffer of scotch to Arthur at the debrief. And Arthur looks like he\u2019s sucking on lemons or something, but every day that Arthur wakes up alive is a gift from Eggsy and they both know it, so Arthur only says, from behind teeth a little more clenched than normal, \u201cGood job on a successful mission,\u201d and that\u2019s all that\u2019s said on the matter.\n\u201cFor the love all all that's good and holy, please get in the habit of turning off your recording equipment,\u201d is Merlin\u2019s dry response, and if Eggsy intends to make Merlin suffer at least once when he finally develops the recording glasses, well that's his right, isn\u2019t it?\n\u201cI\u2019ve been replaced,\u201d is Lancelot\u2019s response, not sounding all that broken up about it - and frankly looking terribly delighted over it, the utter\u00a0prick - because he and Lancelot were never that sort of thing.\n\u201cHe has better hair,\u201d Eggsy quips back to him, and Lancelot rears back over-dramatically, like he\u2019s been struck and hisses, hands over his heart, all faux offence, \u201cLies, vicious lies,\u201d and Eggsy laughs, long and strong, because he\u2019s just so happy.\n***************************************\nAfter almost a month of missions, dates in little restaurants with candlelight, soft kisses at the\u00a0door that lead to frenetic hand jobs and frotting up against the wall, Eggsy finally makes good on his word.\nHe lays Harry out on his bed, and spends hours discovering Harry with his hands and his mouth, every single part that makes him gasp and whimper and moan beneath him. Sucks him off leisurely until Harry is panting, stripped of restraint and even of words, and then spreads him open oh so slowly with lube slick fingers, until that tight, virgin muscle is loose and open.\nSliding into Harry, finally, bottoming out in that tight warmth, is like coming home.\nFucking him, Harry\u2019s oh so flexible young legs up round his shoulders, until they both come so\u00a0hard they nearly go blind, is also really very fantastic too.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Harry says softly, shyly, when they\u2019ve finally come back to themselves, slick and sated, head resting over Eggsy\u2019s heart. And Eggsy...\nEggsy wishes that there were words in the English language to describe how he feels for Harry. Because it seems so trivial to call this thing he feels for Harry love, when it is so much more. Eggsy lives for Harry, for the sound of his footsteps on the stairs in the morning, to the feel of his hair between his fingers, and every beat of his heart that Eggsy thought he\u2019d never get to have with him. Eggsy\u2019s devotion for Harry is such that he\u2019s willing to risk erasing himself from existence to ensure his survival, would consider it worth it for every precious second he\u2019s had with him. Harry means so much to him that Eggsy is literally changing the course of recorded history for him, is aiming to create an entirely new universe for the sole purpose of ensuring that Harry lives past February 14th, 2015.\nHarry is Eggsy\u2019s everything.\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Eggsy says instead, because those are the words that he has, and from the\u00a0way that Harry lights up, all beautiful and brilliant at them, he knows they are more than enough.\nThis is his life, and it\u2019s pretty damn perfect.\nAnd so, that\u2019s how it comes to be that by the end of 1990, Eggsy has added 23 more articles on his wall - 12 from him, and 11 from Harry - and his house is now home to two small dogs and two stupidly happy men.\n1990 ends up being the year that Eggsy stops naming the years, because it and all the ones that follow are all years of Harry, and thus years of happiness and love.\n***************************************\nMore candidate Harry, because reasons.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\u00a0\n***************************************\n\u201cAnd will I tell you that these three lived happily ever after? I will not, for no one ever does. But there was happiness. And they did live.\u201d \u2015 Stephen King, The Dark Tower\n***************************************\nEggsy may stop naming the years, but they still pass, and they are all good years. To Eggsy\u2019s\u00a0secret joy - and Merlin's long suffering sighs - Harry and he become \u2018that couple,\u2019 the disgustingly happy, sappily in love one. They flirt their way through missions - that they absolutely ace, by the way - have a ridiculous amount of mind-blowing sex - occasionally, on said missions - and also watch stupid telly and silly movies curled up at home with JB and Mr. Pickles on respective laps.\nIt is, Eggsy thinks, an amazing way to go through life.\nAnd so, after their first year together, Eggsy begins to measure the passage of time in anniversaries, and never for one second takes for granted the miracle that it is that he can do that.\nAnd even when it goes wrong, they still make it better. Eggsy gets kidnapped by a terrorist cell in Russia a month after their 2nd anniversary, and Harry obliterates them, freeing him from his shackles with hands that shake in relief and in residual fear.\nThe sex afterwards, desperate and shaking, all an affirmation of life and love, is some of the best he\u2019s ever had in his life.\nA year later, he returns the favour when his lover is taken by Bosnian mercenaries, and when he pulls the bag off of Harry\u2019s head and watches his lover blink back at him, there is blood in his teeth, love in his heart and relief in his veins.\nEggsy thinks even now, there are probably people there telling their children terrifying tales of the things they did for love.\nWaking up all wrapped up in Harry, warm and lovely in the mornings, he can\u2019t find it in himself to care.\nFor their 4th anniversary Harry and he end up buying their own place - the posh house that had been just Harry\u2019s before, on it\u2019s little roundabout as a matter of fact - where they knock out one of the walls and build a bigger office, because they are definitely running out of walls for stupid, wonderfully mundane articles.\nPair of gentleman rockstar spies they are.\nTheir fifth year together is the one where Merlin finally gives up the ghost and shaves his head. That year Lancelot buys him shampoo for his birthday, because Lancelot is still, as ever, a wanker.\nMerlin retaliates by replacing Lancelot\u2019s own shampoo with Nair.\nNeedless to say, their sixth anniversary takes place in the middle of a vicious no holds barred prank war, that leaves no clear winner and very few people unscathed.\nHarry is particularly unimpressed by his sudden ownership of a a bright pink pair of Oxfords, though Eggsy\u2019s of the opinion they look quite lovely slung up round his shoulders as he fucks Harry until he\u2019s hoarse.\nAll in all, a pretty great way to celebrate his 35th birthday, Eggsy thinks.\nHonestly, it\u2019s such a lovely way to live that he even forgets sometimes that there is a ticking clock to all of this. Laying with Harry on their couch, he forgets that this miracle that he has found himself in is not free, is not unlimited. Flirting shamelessly with Harry on a mission, it is easy to forget that that this is a show with a steep price of admission, and that payment is soon to be due.\nHe\u2019s just so caught up in being happy.\nAnd then, one day, sometime around their 7th year together, when Eggsy is up early making breakfast for Harry, he catches a particular name of the morning telly he has one for background noise, and it comes crashing back to him.\nRichmond Valentine takes Valentine Industries public, the news scrawl proclaims brightly, innocently, as it runs a PC friendly shot of a younger Richmond Valentine in his customary track suit. It\u2019s a face Eggsy could never forget, no matter how much time travel he did, and suddenly, the bacon becomes drastically less important than it was a moment ago as time, the sneaky bitch, finally catches up with him.\nBecause, Eggsy realizes, it is 1997, and although he is 36, he is too also 6, and somewhere in this city a little boy that he once was is probably getting up for the day. A boy who is having his breakfast made by his smiling mum and his hair ruffled by his oh so alive father.\nSomewhere in this city, there is a little boy whose happiness ticks on a countdown clock that only Eggsy can see, and Eggsy doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nIn a year or so, Lancelot will die, and Harry will nominate Lee Unwin, a marine with a seven year old son, for the position, where he will die in a training accident, leaving that little boy fatherless and his wife a widow.\nAnd Eggsy doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to save him.\n\u201cBreakfast?\u201d Harry enquires hopefully, mumbling from behind him, pulling him from his thoughts to the much more pleasant sight of a truly sleepy Harry, hair all tussled from sex, a hand rubbing one eye in a useless attempt to push the grogginess out.\nHarry, Eggsy knows now, from long standing experience, is not a morning person.\nThe picture he makes fills Eggsy heart so full of love, it nearly bursts. The list of things he would not do for this are a very short one indeed. Perhaps he will save Lee Unwin. Perhaps he will not. It is a query that demands more thought, to be weighed against what he can get away with and still be allowed to keep Harry, oh so alive.\nValentine, on the other hand...\n\u201cOf course love,\u201d he says, presenting Harry with his much needed morning coffee, and steals a kiss from those soft, plush lips.\nAnd smiles.\nThat\u2019s a much easier decision.\n***************************************\nIt should have been harder than that.\nIt\u2019s Eggsy first thought as he stares down at the cooling corpse of Richmond Valentine, bullet hole dead centre to the forehead, pulseless beneath Eggsy\u2019s fingers.\nYou can be damned sure Eggsy checked the body. It ain\u2019t that kind of movie, and all that.\nAnd perhaps it is a strange thought, but it is the one he is left with. Not should I have done this?, for he has always known that it would come to this. Megalomania, that strange faith that Valentine had had in his ideals does not listen to reason, to the rational. No man who paints himself and his genocide of innocent people as the biblical Noah and his ark was going to be swayed by the persuasiveness of Eggsy\u2019s argument, he\u2019s always known that. From the moment he arrived here, and realized that he could keep Harry safe this was always the end point that they would arrive at. That he would stand over this man\u2019s corpse as his killer again, for 400 million lives and Harry, Harry, Harry.\nAlways Harry.\nBut given how much trouble that it had involved the first time, Eggsy almost feels a little cheated now. This might have been a Richmond Valentine with all of his world ending fervour, but it too was one without his paranoia or his military might. A few tranq darts for the security guards, a little tampering with the security cameras, and a single bullet and Eggsy\u2019s just prevented the largest genocide in recent history before it even began, and no one, not even Merlin will be able to prove it was him.\nIt just seems so easy.\n\u201cYou killed him,\u201d a little voice says from behind him, not a question and yet not an accusation either. And Eggsy whips around and sees, with dawning horror, that the clear, smooth voice belongs to a child, a girl no more than ten, standing in the doorway, all rumpled night gown and smooth plastic where her legs should be.\nTempting fate, Eggsy thinks, looking into the soft, intelligent eyes that regard him unblinkingly, brown hair pulled into two braids with little white bows at the ends of them. He\u2019d been tempting fate.\nUsually, if it feels to easy to be true, it is.\n\u201cYes,\u201d He says finally, quietly, to the eyes that regard him so steadily for someone so young, before be asks, trying to be as nonthreatening as possible in his query as a man standing over another dead man\u2019s body with a gun in his hand can be, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cGaby,\u201d She says, softly yet unafraid, strange and remarkable, and suddenly, Eggsy gets it. He can see, in a moment\u2019s clarity how the soft vowels of her name could have become twisted under the lisping accent that Valentine had flaunted. How easily little Gaby, with her soft B\u2019s could have become Gazy, with her oh so sharp Z\u2019s.\nHer oh so sharp everything.\nThis little girl, with her braids and her big brown unafraid eyes, is Gazelle.\nThis, Eggsy thinks, of the loyal killing machine that Gazelle had been, so much more than Valentine had really deserved, explains a lot.\n\u201cHe was a bad man?\u201d The little girl who once grew up to be a woman Eggsy had to kill asks, head tilted as she tries to figure out what has happened, and Eggsy can\u2019t help but admire her insight, oh so keen.\n\u201cHe was going to do a very bad thing,\u201d Eggsy says, because for all that killing Valentine won\u2019t keep him up at night, for all that he knows his own actions were justified, he thinks calling Valentine \u201cbad\u201d would do the man a great disservice. Valentine was a madman, true, but Eggsy\u2019s lived too long now in the realms of grey that make up the world of espionage not to recognize that there was good in Valentine\u2019s intentions, for all that he had certainly used them to pave a first class road to hell.\n\u201cHe was going to hurt a lot of people, so I stopped him,\u201d Eggsy settles on instead, and takes a small, cautious step towards her, and then another when the first isn\u2019t met with a withdrawal, until he\u2019s close enough to crouch down, lowering himself to her eye level.\nGaby nods, accepting this, and Eggsy thinks a girl as bright as her had probably had her own suspicions on the kindness of men like Valentine. And then she turns her big eyes to Eggsy and asks, still so unafraid, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d\nAnd well, Eggsy finds he only has one answer to that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a house as grand as this one\u201d Eggsy finds himself saying, and for all that it\u2019s spontaneous and stupid and perhaps the most unadvised thing he\u2019s ever said, it\u2019s somehow also the one he means most, \u201cBut I do have a nice house, and a very nice man and our two dogs live there with me, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s room for a special little girl there as well, if you\u2019d like to come.\u201d\nAs a tool of Valentine\u2019s, Gazelle had been a force of nature, and the only person he\u2019d ever had felt a twinge of something that might have approached regret for killing that day. Now, with the opportunity to change that, to give this remarkable little girl what Harry once gave him - the opportunity to become more - how can Eggsy not even try?\nEggsy\u2019s just saved 400 million people. He\u2019d like to save one more.\nShe looks at him, stares into him for a moment, and then puts her little soft hand in his.\nAnd Eggsy gathers her up, and takes her home.\n***************************************\nIn retrospect, Harry\u2019s incredibly high eyebrow is probably the best response Eggsy could have\u00a0expected when showing up back home after disappearing in the night, not telling him where he was going and then showing up with a child in his arms.\nHe feels like he might be breaking a relationship rule here. Maybe. Just a little bit.\n\u201cSo, I probably should have asked your opinion on children before bringing one home, rather than after huh?\u201d Eggsy says sheepishly, running his free hand reassuringly over Gaby\u2019s hair where her head rests in the crook of his neck, just the right height for her as she sits, propped on one of his hips.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Harry simply asks, eyes tracing the motion of his hand, and that\u2019s all he asks, because Harry knows him better than anyone, can read all he needs from that one protective motion.\n\u201cGaby,\u201d Eggsy says, when there is no response forth coming from her, nuzzled sleepily into his neck, and he makes sure to enunciate the soft B of her name as he says it again, \u201cHer name is Gaby.\u201d\nNo sharp Z\u2019s here.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you Gaby,\u201d Harry says softly to her, and when his eyes meet Eggsy\u2019s he knows, even before Harry says, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask Arthur to adjust our work schedules,\u201d stepping aside so Eggsy can bring her into their home, Eggsy knows Harry\u2019s answer.\nHarry Hart, after all, has a certain soft spot for youths with potential.\n\u201cHe will,\u201d is all Eggsy says, stepping into the warmth of Harry\u2019s body so that his own forehead rests against Harry\u2019s, and that Gaby is sandwiched safe between them and Harry just holds on because that\u2019s the kind of man Harry is, and the only one Eggsy would ever want to this with.\nIn that moment, Eggsy\u2019s got his whole world in his arms, and everything he\u2019s done done is oh so worth it.\nArthur, naturally, because the man still wishes to continue breathing, does.\nIt\u2019s still a facet of their relationship that brings Eggsy a level of unholy joy.\nAnd so, with a little under the table custody manipulation curtesy of Merlin, Gary Ward and Harry Hart become the legal guardians of one Gabriella Ward-Hart. The hyphen ends up being a compromise, because Harry wouldn\u2019t dare think of not having Eggsy\u2019s last name be there and Eggsy can hardly explain to Harry that isn\u2019t his real name and that when gay marriage becomes legal he intends to take Harry\u2019s anyways. And so, Eggsy finds it just easier to acquiesce\u00a0and apologize to their new daughter for having name that makes her sound like a law firm instead.\nMerlin\u2019s a hacker. They can change it to just Hart later if Gaby wants.\nAnd somehow, that ends up being their only bump in the road to becoming a family. Because Eggsy knows that it should be harder - that there should be some awkwardness at trying to fit this new person into their dynamic. That there should an adjustment phase where they try and figure it out and fail a whole bunch instead before finally getting it.\nBut somehow, there just isn\u2019t. Eggsy\u2019d basically raised Gracie, and he finds it oh so simple to tap back into that paternal instinct, and Harry\u2019s always been fantastic with children - the utterly perfect wanker - and so they just somehow skip over that first phase and slip right into just being a family.\nEggsy can\u2019t say he minds.\nAnd yet, for all that he finds himself happier than he has ever been, there is a part of him that wishes he\u2019d thought to ask the Doctor if there was a sign for when he\u2019d done enough, created this new universe. Because now he\u2019s done it, killed Valentine and saved those 400 million people, but he doesn\u2019t know if his continued presence here means he\u2019s done enough or not. Doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll get to stay, or if each morning will be his last here, in this perfect little happiness that he\u2019s managed to eke out.\nAll he can do is live, unsure of what the next day will bring.\nJust like, he supposes, everyone else has too.\nStaring at Harry and Gaby shuffling into the kitchen, both rumpled and groggy and barely awake, Eggsy thinks he can rather live with it.\n\u201cAnd what do my two sleepyheads want for breakfast this morning?\u201d Eggsy asks, heart nearly overfull with love at the sight of his little family.\nSo, Eggsy lives.\nStill no suspects in the murder of tech CEO Richmond Valentine, the news scroll proclaims, ignored and switched away in favour of Postman Pat as Eggsy flips a rasher of bacon over in the pan.\nIt works out pretty well for him, if he does say so himself.\n***************************************\nAnd then one day, Harry stands before him, a strange shuttered look on his face and\u00a0announces, voice heavy, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a knight.\u201d\nAnd Eggsy\u2019s tired, because he\u2019s been up for 48 hours straight with a sick Gaby, and so he asks, before his brain can catch up with his mouth, \u201cWho...\u201d\nAnd then his mind finally engages, and Eggsy trails off, feeling like he\u2019s been struck in the chest, a bullet against his suit at point blank range, because its Lancelot.\nOf course it\u2019s Lancelot.\nLancelot who had smiled at him when they\u2019d run into each other at the firing range, flirted shamelessly as Eggsy had thoroughly out shot him. Lancelot who\u2019d mentioned in passing an easy mission to Paris with a fond wink and nod to their first mission. Lancelot who\u2019d smiled softly, real, when he\u2019d asked for Gaby\u2019s size so he could bring her back something pretty from Paris, because Gaby had \u201cUncle Lance\u201d wrapped around her little pinky.\nLancelot who\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back,\u201d easy, casually and turned away and Eggsy hadn\u2019t thought anything of it because it was just an easy mission to Paris, and of course he\u2019d be back.\nLancelot, who is dead.\nIt was always going to be Lancelot.\nThey never come back.\nAnd perhaps it\u2019s wrong, but Eggsy\u2019s first grief is not for Lancelot, but for Harry. Because once upon a time that hasn\u2019t happened yet Harry had looked at him and promised him he\u2019d be back and then he\u2019d gone and bloody well died too, and Eggsy finds himself staring at Harry, Harry who is alive now but who fucking died and begging, \u201cYou can\u2019t...You can\u2019t ever do this to me. You can\u2019t ever tell me you\u2019ll be back and then just...not come back.\u201d\nAnd then, voice broken, because he just can\u2019t, can\u2019t have come this far and done this much for it to all end in having to watch Harry walk away again, fail to come back to him, \u201cYou have to promise you won\u2019t ever do that.\u201d\n\u201cDarling...\u201d Harry starts, trailing off, pulling into Eggsy\u2019s needy embrace, eyes soft if not a little confused, because this isn\u2019t exactly a normal reaction for Eggsy.\nBut then, this is hardly a normal scenario, this strange parody of his greatest nightmare and all Eggsy can find himself able to do is plead, \u201cPlease,\u201d helplessly clutching Harry\u2019s lapels and\u00a0remembering only too well the sound of that one final gunshot that made a liar out of Harry and his promise to come back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never choose to leave you,\u201d Harry says, for Harry is not a man who makes promises lightly, this Eggsy knows, and this is the best he will give.\nIt\u2019s enough.\nAnd then, Eggsy thinks not of Harry, and his residual grief that still simmers there, for a death that has both happened and yet not, but of Lancelot. Lancelot, who whined about his hair to the point of ridiculousness. Lancelot whose eyes always twinkled with such mischief right before he did something that took years off the end of Eggsy\u2019s life. Lancelot who\u2019d been his first friend in this strange new world. Who\u2019d fucked him and laughed with him and had utterly supported him and Harry, to the point of demanding that, when they make it legal, if you ask anyone but me to be your best man, I\u2019ll invade some small country in retribution, you know I will.\nLancelot, who is dead.\nAnd so Eggsy curls into Harry\u2019s welcome embrace, and weeps for his friend.\n***************************************\nStaring at Lee Unwin in the recruits barracks is...a bit of a trip, Eggsy decides, to understate it massively.\nEggsy doesn\u2019t have many memories of his father, being only seven and all when he died, but the man that stands before him is largely as he remembers. They\u2019re of similar height, and though Lee has darker hair and greener eyes than him, Eggsy can still see the resemblance, where he\u2019d inherited his father\u2019s chin and the shape of his lips. They\u2019re by no means a splitting image of each other or anything, but Lee could pass for a cousin of his if he had too, a thought that amuses Eggsy a bit, just for the sheer ridiculousness of it.\nHe\u2019s older than his own father.\nHe can\u2019t imagine many people can say that.\nAnd looking at him, watching him break through the glass as Eggsy himself and Harry had done, Eggsy comes to a decision.\nHe\u2019s going to save him.\nNot really because he\u2019s his father, because in the simplest way he isn\u2019t - Eggsy\u2019s father died, and he grew up without him and no amount of time travel can change that for Eggsy. No, Eggsy is going to save him because Lee is a good man, and because he can change it for that little boy at home, waiting for his father to come back and keep the promise he knows he made.\nEggsy intends to make sure Lee keeps that promise.\nAnd so, although Eggsy\u2019s own candidate doesn\u2019t make it past the second round, he sticks around the trials. Harry might be Lee\u2019s proposer, and Eggsy\u2019s not trying to hone in on that, but\u00a0he can hardly resist the opportunity to know a little more about Lee, this man who is his father but not.\nIt\u2019s a curiosity that apparently doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending more time on these trials then you did with the Kay ones,\u201d Harry says once, a light hint of a question in his tone as he catches Eggsy heading down to the range to watch the candidates - mostly Lee, though James as well, because Eggsy\u2019s curious about the man who was Roxy\u2019s predesessor and Ben\u2019s successor.\nSo far, he thinks Lancelot would have loved James, what with them both being gun crazy flirts. It\u2019s almost a thought that makes up for the fact that he can\u2019t tell it to Lancelot.\nAlmost.\n\u201cBetter candidates,\u201d Eggsy says with a wink, because he can hardly explain his real reason, and\u00a0I want to make sure they deserve Lancelot\u2019s seat is just a little too raw to share with even Harry.\nInstead, Eggsy just kisses Harry, stupidly perfect in his suit, and goes on his way.\n***************************************\n\nWhat Eggsy doesn\u2019t see is how Harry\u2019s returning smile is a little frayed at the edges. Is too busy trying to learn all the things about this man who was his father that he doesn\u2019t see Harry\u2019s eyes dim at every smile Eggsy gives to Lee, doesn\u2019t see his mouth pinch when Eggsy brags about Lee\u2019s marksmanship scores, or see his hands creep tighter on his tea cup when Merlin snarks that the last time he\u2019s seen Eggsy with a favourite like this it was Harry himself.\n\n\nBut Eggsy doesn\u2019t see any of that.\n\n***************************************\nWhen James and Lee both pass the dog test, Eggsy knows exactly what they\u2019re going to do for\u00a0a tie-breaker.\nEggsy knows how his father died. Unlike Lancelot, or Harry\u2019s predecessor, he remembers every word of the case file about his father\u2019s death. The insurgent, the grenade, everything. Knows that James and Harry and Merlin all missed it, and that his father had dived on the grenade and saved them all. A noble death, to be sure, but one Eggsy doesn\u2019t intend to let time repeat.\nSo Eggsy talks his way into going on the mission instead of Merlin.\nMerlin, Harry and James missed the insurgent pulling the pin, because they weren\u2019t looking,\u00a0weren\u2019t expecting it. \u00a0How could they have been?\nEggsy is. Eggsy is expecting it. Eggsy sees the grenade, sees him about to ready it.\nSo Eggsy shoots him in the face.\n\"We rather needed him alive,\u201d Harry says, perturbed, looking over at Eggsy as he lifts his black mask to reveal his face. But his voice trails off to nothing as the insurgents hand slumps down, and the grenade rolls out of it and onto the floor, pin still attached, harmless in a way it wouldn\u2019t have been if Eggsy\u2019d waited another 10 seconds.\n\u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d Eggsy says, and throws him a wink, all adrenaline fuelled cheek, as Harry curses under his breath and scowls, because Harry hates missing things.\n\u201cThat was brilliant sir,\u201d Lee says, clearly impressed, and Eggsy turns his attention from a nearly sulking Harry to say breezily, so he doesn\u2019t have to dwell on what once was and could have so easily been again, \u201cI thought it prudent to limit the daring heroics to a minimum.\u201d\nAnd then, with a raised eyebrow at Lee, only half chastising, because even if Eggsy didn\u2019t know that was how his father had died, knowing Lee and his character as he does now would be enough to inform him of this, \u201cSurely having a recruit jump on a live grenade would be bad for moral.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Lee says back, entirely unrepentant - answering the question of where Eggsy got his cheek - and Eggsy smiles back at him, the smile of the utterly relieved, because he\u2019s saved his father and Gaby and he\u2019s still here, they\u2019re all still here.\nHe doesn\u2019t see the frown that creeps onto Harry\u2019s face.\n***************************************\nIt\u2019s Merlin who tells him, once their back to UK HQ that James is to be the next Lancelot because Lee has decided he\u2019s going to resign his candidacy, and it\u2019d be a lie to say Eggsy\u2019s too disappointed at the news. Eggsy knows Lee would have made a fantastic Lancelot, but he also knows in the part of him that wanted to save him for Lee\u2019s Eggsy and Michelle that the man has a better chance of being there for his family if he isn\u2019t a Kingsman.\nThat, and its still a bit freaking weird to be older than his dad, which would make having him a coworker a bit...odd.\nSo when he runs into Lee in the barracks, cleaning out his stuff all Eggsy says is, \u201cI heard the news,\u201d and tries to look as supportive as he can.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a wife and a kid that need me,\u201d Lee says, with a smile that looks a bit strange on his face to Eggsy, as he says, easy enough, \u201cI guess today made me realize that I want them more than I want to be a knight.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to balance this and family,\u201d Eggsy agrees simply, thinking of his own little family and the balancing act they\u2019ve worked out - Gaby begging for boarding school had really helped, for all that he hates having her away no matter how much he knows she loves it.\n\u201cYes, but you and Galahad manage to do it,\u201d Lee says, and then, so smoothly, so slyly it takes Eggsy a second, \u201cdon\u2019t you Eggsy?\u201d\n\u201cWell we...\u201d Eggsy says, still caught on the thought of what they should do with Gaby on the summer hols - Eggsy\u2019s still putting in his vote for Corfu, for all that Harry wants to go to Athens - and then what Lee\u2019s said catches up with him and he just stops.\n\nEggsy.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no way that Lee would have ever heard him called that. Everyone at base calls him Tristan. No one in this time but Harry even knows to call him Eggsy, and Harry is utterly ruthless about informal names at work - Eggsy can\u2019t get Harry to call him that when he blows him at work. Harry\u2019d never have referred to Eggsy by that name in front of Lee.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out before, why you were so familiar to me, but I see it now. It\u2019s all in the eyes,\u201d Lee says, clearly taking Eggsy\u2019s stunned silence as confirmation of his theory, as he continues, a cross between baffled and amazed, \u201cYou\u2019re my son. Somehow, against all logic, you\u2019re my Eggsy.\u201d\nYes, Eggsy thinks, Lee would have made an excellent Kingsman.\n\u201cI was,\u201d Eggsy settles on, because the full truth is too complicated to put into words, \u201cIn a timeline that is hopefully divorced from this one now. Now, your son is home with his mother, waiting for his father to come home and I\u2019m...someone else.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up with me, did you?\u201d Lee continues, still trying to work through it, and doing a pretty good job of it if Eggsy does say so himself, \u201cIn your...timeline Galahad missed the grenade and you weren\u2019t there to correct it and I...he - god this is bizarre - jumped on that grenade, and you lost your father.\u201d\n\u201cI found myself with an opportunity to change that outcome,\u201d Eggsy says, nodding in affirmation, before continuing with a shrug, because it is hardly the noble thing it might seem, given how long it took him to come to that decision, \u201cIt seemed like one worth taking advantage of.\u201d\nBut Lee just smiles at him, and then Eggsy finds himself drawn into a hug that Eggsy can\u2019t help but burrow into, because for all that this isn\u2019t his father he is Lee Unwin, is the man his father was, and Eggsy hasn\u2019t had a hug from Lee Unwin in a very long time.\n\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not your father, but let me say this as the father of Eggsy Unwin,\u201d Lee says, pulling back so that he can say it to Eggsy\u2019s face, pride shinning from those familiar eyes, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\nSo yeah, Eggsy\u2019s crying. He\u2019s man enough to admit it.\nLee Unwin is proud him.\nIt\u2019s good enough.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Eggsy says, drawing away and taking a moment to discretely compose himself which Lee returns, before he asks, politely but with some genuine curiosity, because Eggsy\u2019s\u00a0never really given much thought to what happens after this moment, \u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d\nBecause right now there is a seven year old boy who is going to grow up to look an awful lot like him, and that could end up being...really hard to explain in a few years.\nFreaking time travel.\n\u201cHad a job offer from someone I met in the service, in Chicago,\u201d Lee says, an easy smile on his face, that makes Eggsy think he knows exactly what he\u2019s thinking, \u201cPrivate security, great pay, benefits for the family. I think I\u2019m going to avail myself of that.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck then,\u201d Eggsy says, holding out his hand and Lee takes it and returns the sentiment and as they part ways, and part lives Eggsy finds himself thinking yes, maybe now everything is going to be alright.\nRight up until he gets home and takes one look at Harry\u2019s face as he sits on their bed, so terribly shuttered and closed and somehow hurt.\nTempting fate again, Eggsy thinks.\nEggsy killed an awful lot of people the last time someone put a look like that on Harry\u2019s face.\n\u201cDarling, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eggsy demands, and then, as he\u2019s hit by a terrible thought, half panicked, \u201cHas something happened to Gaby?\u201d\n\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Harry asks quietly, staring up at Eggsy with that terrible look in his eyes, like it\u2019s hurting him even to ask it and Eggsy just stares back at him, like he\u2019s speaking Korean or something, for all the sense what he\u2019s just asked makes.\n\u201cDo I love who?\u201d Eggsy says, so utterly bewildered he\u2019s not even panicked anymore, because what the hell is Harry even on about?\n\u201cLee Unwin,\u201d Harry says steadily, and Eggsy can only get more bug eyed as he finishes, asking again, so terribly composed in a way that Eggsy knows means Harry is really actually fraying at the seams, \u201cDo you love him?\u201d\n\u201cDo I love...\u201d Eggsy stars, and then just has to splutter off, because what the fuck? Is he in love with Lee?\nWhat in the ever loving fuck is Harry smoking?\n\u201cHave you gone off your rocker?!\u201d Eggsy settles on, utterly stupefied that anyone, much less Harry himself couldn\u2019t see how ridiculously, utterly gone on Harry he is to ever even think he\u2019d so much as dream of considering someone else, much less Lee.\nSeriously, what the actual fuck?!\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t insult my intelligence. I saw you in his arms today, and I know that you killed that man to save Lee, not James or I,\u201d Harry says in response, not backing down, eyes shuttered and pained and a stab to Eggsy\u2019s damn heart as he asks, voice breaking on the last word, \u201cSo please, do you love him?\u201d\nIt\u2019s is only the knowledge that it is him that put that look in Harry\u2019s eyes that has him actually stopping to consider what Harry thinks he must have seen, instead of just glazing over it in stunned confusion, because Eggsy would rather stab himself in the face then hurt Harry. And once he starts actually looking, well...\nBecause well yes, alright true, he\u2019s spent more time with Lee than any other candidate, but surely not enough for Harry to think that! Sure, he\u2019d helped with his marksmanship, and brought his dog a few extra toys, and listened to all of Lee\u2019s marine stories because hey, Eggsy\u2019d never got to hear them from his dad and he was hardly about to let that opportunity pass. And yeah, maybe he\u2019d been a little more effusive to Lee in praising his victories, and maybe he\u2019d shown a little favouritism to Lee over James, and yeah, so he had technically killed a man for him...\nOk, so maybe now he sees how Harry could have come to that conclusion.\nFuck.\nCreated the appearance of trying to cheat on his lover with his own father.\nFreaking time travel.\n\u201cHarry, I love you more than life itself,\u201d Eggsy says, trying to will Harry to see the truth of it as he continues, \u201cI\u2019m not cheating on you with Lee. Lee is, he\u2019s just...\u201d Eggsy stops, no idea how to finish that sentence until it\u2019s already out of his mouth, \u201che\u2019s my father.\u201d\nSo, apparently he\u2019s decided to blurt out the ludicrous truth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not...what?\u201d Harry says, blinking back at him, baffled and still clearly a little hurt and Eggsy can\u2019t have that, can\u2019t stand that pain knowing that he was the one that put it there. And so Eggsy decides, like ripping off a bandaid that he\u2019s in it now, and he might as well go for broke.\nEggsy\u2019d give Harry everything, if he could.\nThe least he could give him is the truth.\n\u201cPlease, love, there\u2019s something I need to show you,\u201d Eggsy says, as he makes his way to the safe and opens it, bringing out the glasses he hasn\u2019t touched in a decade and offering them to Harry with a soft entreaty, \u201cTrust me?\u201d\nAnd Harry, confused and still a little hurt, takes them, and does.\nAnd so Eggsy watches Harry watch the video he knows off by heart. Watches him take in Eggsy\u2019s own age as he looks in the mirror, at least a decade younger and then Merlin, easily two decades older than he is now. Watches him call Roxy Lancelot, and interact with his mum\u00a0and Gracie, the family Harry knows he doesn\u2019t have now. Watches him take in the date, timestamped on the video, April 8th, 2018 and then watches him bring those beloved brown eyes up to Eggsy\u2019s own, still utterly confused but trusting.\nAnd that hurt, that terrible, terrible hurt has started to fade away.\nGod, Eggsy loves this man.\nAnd so Eggsy takes the glasses from his hands and holds Harry\u2019s in his own, and tells him a story.\n\u201cI was born Gary Unwin, in the year 1991, to Lee and Michelle Unwin,\u201d Eggsy starts, and once he has the truth just spills from him, so ready to escape from where he\u2019s bottled it up for all those years, \u201cWhen I was seven, my father died in a Kingsman training exercise, and the man who recruited him gave me this medal and told me if I ever needed help, I could call and say \u201coxfords not brogues,\u201d and he\u2019d help me. And one day I did just that, and he got me out of a jail sentence and made me his proposal for the open knighthood.\u201d\nAnd then, with a squeeze of Harry\u2019s hand still curled in his own he says softly, releasing forth his most painful truth, \u201cAnd I fell in love with him, but then he went and got himself killed by some megalomaniacal psychopath trying to commit mass genocide.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s hands white knuckle on his own, but his eyes tell him to continue, and so Eggsy does, keeping his voice low and steady even as the story becomes impossibly more fantastic, \u201cAnd then, by some impossible twist of fate - and aliens - I found myself here, back in a time when that man I loved was alive, and so I stayed there and waited for him.\u201d\n\u201cBut not for Lee,\u201d Eggsy reassures, because he doesn\u2019t want Harry to ever spend another moment thinking that he has ever come second to Eggsy, because Eggsy would let the world burn if it meant saving Harry, \u201cI didn\u2019t stay so I could save him. I stayed because in a world entirely alien to me because you were out there somewhere, and I didn't want to live anywhere that wasn\u2019t true anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI love you so much I changed the whole course of history for you,\u201d Eggsy says gently, heart in his voice to the still silent Harry, and then, softer, and without the joking tone he\u2019d normally utilize in making this point, \u201cSo I hope that answers the question about whether or not I\u2019m in love with someone else.\u201d\nHarry just blinks at him in response, and Eggsy lets him take that moment, lets him process, because this is important, and Eggsy can wait.\nFor Harry, Eggsy\u2019d wait forever.\n\u201cYou...I\u2019m not worth all that,\u201d Harry stutters forth eventually, looking stunned and overwhelmed, and Eggsy loves him enough to not call him on how massive a lie that is, because Harry is worth everything.\n\u201cYou are to me,\u201d Eggsy says simply instead, bringing the hand he still has in his own up to his lips for a soft kiss and staring into Harry\u2019s eyes, to let him see the truth of it, the true depth of feeling that Eggsy has for him.\nToo see that it\u2019s endless.\nEggsy thinks that in the next second they are falling onto each other, all mouths and teeth and\u00a0desperation is probably a good sign that Harry\u2019s got it, at least a little bit.\n***************************************\nLater, much later, after they\u2019ve relearned each other in every way two humans can, Eggsy finds himself still awake, laying in the warmth of Harry\u2019s slumbering body, restless.\nWaiting, Eggsy realizes, thinking back to what The Doctor had told him all those years ago, and although Eggsy has no proof, he knows, as sure as he knows his own name, that this is the moment of truth, so to speak.\nThis is where the universe is weighing him, to see if what he has done is worthy or wanting.\nEggsy feels like he\u2019s sitting on a precipice, just waiting to see which direction he will fall. Will it be into this world, this universe that he\u2019s managed to create where he can stay with Gaby and Harry, or will he have not done enough and he\u2019ll just be erased, will flicker away, a paradox corrected by time?\nEggsy can\u2019t say.\nBe he doesn\u2019t fear, doesn\u2019t worry, because laying in the warmth of Harry\u2019s arms, waiting for the cosmos itself to decide his fate, he knows whatever comes - or does not come - tomorrow it\u2019ll have been worth it, for every second he had with Harry and with Gaby.\nSo Eggsy presses a kiss to Harry\u2019s slumbering head, and curls into him.\nAnd sleeps.\n***************************************\n\u00a0He wakes up.\nThe dawn light is peeking through the curtains, and Harry is a warm weight at his back, and\u00a0Eggsy is awake, and still here.\n\u201cMerlin just called,\u201d Harry whispers into his neck, voice more professional than truly sad as he\u00a0delivers his news, \u201cArthur died of a heart attack last night in his sleep.\u201d\nChecks and balances, Eggsy thinks, of The Doctor and his warning, of how the universe evens out its own slate, of how there would be losses to keep it in the black and form a new universe, one different enough he\u2019d get to stay.\nAnd Eggsy thinks, I did it.\nIt's an acceptable loss, in Eggsy\u2019s book, and a far better death than Chester King deserved.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Eggsy says, brushing a soft kiss to Harry\u2019s forehead, before clambering out of their bed to make his way to the shower, \u201cWe\u2019d better go then.\u201d\nWork to be done, and all that.\n***************************************\nEpilogue\n***************************************\n\u201cHonestly sweetheart,\u201d Eggsy says, fondly bemused, propping the phone between his shoulder\u00a0and his ear as he searches for a file on his desk, before turning his attention back to his panicking daughter on the phone, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019re even worried right now.\u201d\n\u201cBecause she might say no!\u201d His daughter wails into the phone, no sign of her usual calm composure, and Eggsy has to bite down his chuckle, because this is a moment for dad skills and not laughter.\n\u201cSweet, I\u2019d be a very poor spy if I didn\u2019t notice how enamoured our new Kay is with you,\u201d He reassures, because it\u2019s true enough - Roxy had taken one look at Gaby and pretty much swallowed her tongue, \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to say no to being your valentine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my dad, you have to say that,\u201d Gaby says, somewhere between a whine and a sulk, though with an undeniably fond undertone.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Eggsy allows, and then, with a little bit of that good old Unwin cheek, because he just can\u2019t resist, \u201cBut Merlin isn\u2019t, and he\u2019s got a pool up and running for when you two are going finally get on with it.\u201d\n\u201cThat gossipy little bugger,\u201d Gaby hisses, before she says good-naturedly, because his girl knows him, \u201cI take it you\u2019ll share your winnings with me?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you actually ask her out,\u201d Eggsy reminds her, as he begins searching in the drawers for the file he\u2019s looking for, a ridiculous endeavour because Harry is fantastic at many things but filing isn\u2019t one of them.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Gaby sighs, hugely, before psyching herself up with a deep breath, \u201cI am a Kingsman. I have defused literal bombs before. I can do this.\u201d\n\u201cGo get her sweetheart,\u201d Eggsy says, finally letting that chuckle out as he hangs up. And then, when he fishes a picture frame he hasn\u2019t seen a long while out of the draw instead of that elusive file he takes a moment to just look at it, and remain as bemused at its existence as ever.\nBecause the picture is the one that Lee Unwin sent him of his son and his new husband at their wedding, and looking at it he can\u2019t help but shake his head, as he always does, because he needs no more proof that he and the Gary Unwin of this time are different people than the fact that the man staring down lovingly at Lee\u2019s son is none other than Charlie fucking Heskath.\nTo say that Eggsy hadn\u2019t laughed so hard he\u2019d fallen out of his chair when he\u2019d first seen the picture would be a lie.\nThat had been a hard one to explain to Harry.\nAnd yes, Eggsy knows that it isn\u2019t quite the Charlie he\u2019d met - and punched in the face and then kind of blown up - because this Charlie\u2019s parents had lost most of their fortune when Richmond Valentine had been found murdered and his stock prices had plummeted.\nOops.\nHowever, some good that had apparently come out of it was that it resulted in a Charlie that apparently grew up humble and dedicated himself to helping the less fortunate as a doctor in an under serviced intercity Chicago community. And that\u2019s where he\u2019d met Gary Unwin, the young firefighter with a midwestern accent and that\u2019d been that apparently, according to Lee\u2019s note that had accompanied the picture.\nBuried balls deep in his husband, that bloody hair mussed and tangled across his sweaty forehead as Harry bloody well gasps his name, Eggsy\u2019s just decided to be satisfied by the fact that, between the two of them, he clearly has the superior taste in men.\nReally, he thinks, staring down at Harry, his Harry, slumped on his forearms, spent and exhausted and oh so in love with this perfect man. Perfection from his head to his toes, from that impossible hair to his biteable pecs to the ring he wears on his finger that clinks with it\u2019s twin when Eggsy twines their fingers together, this little tangible symbol that calls Harry his.\nNo, Eggsy thinks, impossibly in love, no one could even call it a contest.\nAnd well, like the cherry on top, dinner at The Savoy, a show at in the West End, and then a great deal of ridiculously filthy sex with his fantastically handsome husband to cap off the evening is certainly Eggsy\u2019s idea of a good Valentine\u2019s day.\nAnd, if Gaby\u2019s texts were any indication, he\u2019s pretty sure he also won the pool.\nThat Eggsy goes to sleep that night in a good mood, wrapped in the warmth of a sweaty, sex sated Harry is perhaps an understatement.\nHe\u2019s just so happy.\n***************************************\nIt\u2019s quiet when Eggsy wakes up the next morning.\nNot utterly; the house still makes its ambient creaks, and a horn sounds outside as their neighbours try to shuffle three children into the car and off to school as is their ritual. But still, there is something quiet even about that noise, something that makes the morning feel heavier, more weighted then it probably should and has Eggsy at a higher alert.\n\u201cSomething wrong, darling?\u201d Harry enquires, picking up on Eggsy\u2019s mood, voice utterly groggy, still half asleep and half muddled from where his face is smushed adorably into the pillow. And for all that it\u2019s hardly a serious query, more a gentle platitude than anything else, Eggsy stops for a moment and considers, takes weight of the answer.\nThere\u2019s a crick in his neck and this stiffness in his back, because being 54 means that waking up means a couple new aches and pains. His right arm hurts, because he fractured it a month ago on a mission, and he doesn\u2019t heal the way that he used to 30 years ago. His glasses are now for use and not for show, because otherwise he\u2019d have to play trombone with everything he tries to read, and there is a silvering of his hair at his temples that wasn\u2019t there 2 years ago.\nAnd Eggsy smiles, because now he\u2019s awake, and because now he remembers what he\u2019d forgotten in his waking drowsiness.\nIt\u2019s February 15th, 2015, and Harry - Harry, who looks just like he did when, in another life he promised to come back and never did - is here, in their bed, his husband, and one day older than he\u2019s ever been before.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eggsy says, brimming with nothing but utter happiness and love, snuggling back into the warmth of his husband to whisper into the soft curve of his neck, \u201cEverything\u2019s perfect.\u201d\nAnd it is.\n***************************************\nFIN\n***************************************\n\u00a0"
