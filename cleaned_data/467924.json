    "text": "Derek\u2019s options are limited.\nHis head\u2019s still ringing from the fall; the bones below his right knee are so far gone that they\u2019re not so much healing as starting over; the heavy, drowning feeling in the left side of his chest isn\u2019t going to fade until he can sit upright enough to get the sharp edges of his ribcage aligned. There\u2019s something wrong with his lower back, not enough to keep him from moving but enough to make it agony when he does.\nHis phone isn\u2019t getting reception down here, surrounded by the sides of the concrete shaft and the splintered remains of the elevator cage itself. He could howl for his betas, but he\u2019s got no way of knowing if there are more traps and no way of warning them if there are. It\u2019s optimistic to think his lungs would be up for it, in any case.\nThe only way he\u2019s getting out of here is to heal enough to scale the wall to the first floor. It\u2019s maybe eight feet up \u2013 an easy jump any other time, and right now it might as well be the moon. He doubts he has the time.\nIt\u2019s a small miracle that the hunters aren\u2019t on him yet. He hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d gotten brave enough to set traps in town, but he should have. The Argents hadn\u2019t been subtle about splintering apart like a pipe bomb, and those of them that are left are too busy picking up the pieces to mind the store. The outsiders rushing to fill the vacuum don\u2019t care as much about discretion or collateral damage.\nIt\u2019s why he\u2019d been out here in the first place. The train station is an open secret these days, and can\u2019t be the pack\u2019s only safehouse when things go to hell; a nice, abandoned construction zone seemed like a decent fallback.\nIdiot. They must have had surveillance - the elevator cable hadn\u2019t blown until he\u2019d stepped in to test the electrical hookups \u2013 and there\u2019s no way they won\u2019t have noticed.\nAnd suddenly his time is up. There\u2019s an engine getting closer, and then footsteps running in his direction. He claws his way to his feet and sways there. If he\u2019s going down, he\u2019ll take it standing.\nThe last thing he expects is Stiles\u2019 resigned face staring down at him. \u201cOh,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nThen he ducks back out of view. It isn\u2019t a surprise when his footsteps head rapidly away. It is when they come just as quickly back. Stiles leans over the edge again with his jacket dangling from one hand.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else that\u2019ll reach. We\u2019ve got, like, thirty seconds here, so chop, chop.\u201d\nIt\u2019s stupid, but Derek\u2019s not prepared to have another choice. The understanding that if he takes it, it will be obvious exactly how vulnerable he is right now freezes him in place.\nStiles reads his hesitation and shakes the coat at him. \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody else lining up for the job, okay, so drop the deep interrogation of my motives, Kojak, and grab the damn sleeve.\u201d\nHe does. With help, he even manages to scrabble up onto solid ground without passing out. It\u2019s a near thing, though, and he\u2019s on his knees trying to blink away the dark spots when Stiles\u2019 voice registers again.\n\u201c- and holy Jesus that\u2019s rebar sticking out of\u2026 I am going to be scarred for life and we really, really need to go now.\u201d\nStiles ducks under Derek\u2019s arm and drags him along until Derek gets enough of a stagger going to contribute. By the time they make it past the construction fence, he can hear trucks closing in on the other side of the site. The Jeep is sitting in the shadow of the tree line, and Stiles shoves him into it with a muttered, \u201cCome on, come on.\u201d\nThey\u2019re ten minutes down the road with no headlights behind them before Derek manages to ask, \u201cHow did you know I was there?\u201d\n\u201cThese guys aren\u2019t exactly Einsteins, and they like cheap radios. We figured out their frequencies a while ago. It\u2019s mostly like listening to the All Paint Drying, All the Time station, but they started going nuts about this address tonight. I zip over to find your cranky ass in a sling, and here we are.\u201d He gives Derek the side-eye. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding on my seats, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cIt could be you bleeding on them.\u201d As threats go, it\u2019s not his best, probably because he is still losing blood.\nStiles rolls his eyes. Derek will worry about how little he impresses the kid later.\nIt\u2019s a mark of how out of it he still is that he doesn\u2019t pay attention to where they are until they\u2019re parked. \u201cYour house?\u201d\nStiles comes around to the passenger side before bothering to answer. \u201cI\u2019m guessing the boxcar motel is out for you tonight. If you\u2019ve got other suggestions, I\u2019m open to them. Otherwise\u2026\u201d He opens the car door at Derek\u2019s reluctant nod. \u201cYeah, thought so.\u201d\nThey manage the same awkward three-legged shuffle over to the house, Stiles\u2019 arm tightening around Derek\u2019s waist when they get to the porch stairs.\n\u201cOh my god, I am not thinking about what my hand is currently covered in.\u201d\nNow would be a great time for an irritated growl. Derek\u2019s getting on that as soon as he stops wanting to pass out.\nInside the door, they both pause at the foot of the staircase. Stiles whines low in his throat, like he\u2019s getting the short end of the stick here, and then sighs. \u201cThe shower\u2019s up there, and this is going to be\u2026 yeah. I\u2019d rather hose you down than explain bloodstains on the hardwood.\u201d\nHe at least looks at Derek for confirmation. That\u2019s something. It doesn\u2019t make the climb up any less hellish, but it gives him the illusion of agreeing to it. They\u2019re both panting by the time Stiles shrugs him off onto the edge of the bathtub. Derek focuses on staying upright while Stiles hauls out an impressive first aid kit from under the sink.\n\u00a0\u201cGravity and I were not best buddies in my youth,\u201d Stiles explains, catching his look. \u201cSo, are you ever going to clarify how you wound up needing my personal Lassie skills?\u201d\n\u201cI fell.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 fell? That\u2019s it? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going with? Mr. Toothy Badass himself just tripped and, oops, took a little tumble. Where the latest contestants on Who Wants to Kill a Creature of the Night happened to be watching. Yeah.\u201d\n\u201cI fell really far.\u201d\nStiles blinks at him. \u201cWow. Fire, water, air\u2026 You\u2019re, like, one live burial away from having issues with all the natural elements. Remind me not to be anywhere near you when mudslide season hits.\u201d\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re leaving town?\u201d he asks hopefully.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m going back to avoiding you.\u201d\nStiles runs a pointed glance between them and around the small bathroom. \u201cRight. How\u2019s that working out for you again?\u201d\nDerek just grunts. It\u2019s not worth putting effort into a reply.\n\u201cNo, seriously, is it a werewolf thing? For just three easy installments of $9.95, you too can gain claws, confidence, and the inability to plan worth crap.\u201d\nA new thought hits Derek. \u201cYour dad isn\u2019t home?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, face closing right down. His jaw tightens. \u201cHe\u2019s doing some contract work with a security company on overnights.\u201d\nThe Sheriff had always been fair, at least, given all the things he couldn\u2019t know. Derek hadn\u2019t celebrated when he\u2019d heard about him getting fired.\n\u201cWhen do I need to be out of here in the morning?\u201d\n\u201cJust stay in my room. He won\u2019t look.\u201d Stiles swallows. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly talking much right now.\u201d\nSorry isn\u2019t an option, but Derek manages a nod. Stiles fiddles with a roll of gauze for a while and then drops it on the counter to gesture at Derek. \u201cYou ready to get on with the process that\u2019s going to haunt my nightmares? Seriously, I think I\u2019m going to have to extract things, and that\u2019s just not in my job description. I\u2019m pretty sure all the first aid classes say to leave stuff in, too, but then every day is opposite day with werewolves, so\u2026\u201d\nDerek tunes him out and braces himself for the pain.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe comes to mostly naked, soaking wet on the bottom of the tub. Stiles is standing with his back to him, shirtless and dripping as he finishes turning off the shower overhead. Taking stock, Derek\u2019s lungs are both in working order, and his back has faded down to a persistent ache. His leg\u2019s still out of commission for anything above a shuffle.\nStiles is pale when he hands Derek a towel and helps drag him upright. With distance, the tub looks like a horror movie set, but Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything as they limp down the hall. He steps back once Derek\u2019s on the edge of the bed.\nThe silence is unsettling, coming from him. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got clothes I can borrow, I\u2019ll take the couch,\u201d Derek tries. Even at this speed, he can be gone before anyone else gets through the front door.\nStiles doesn\u2019t play along. He hands over a shirt and sleep pants without comment, and then turns his back like Derek\u2019s got any virtue to preserve. When Derek drags himself toward the door, though, it gets his attention. He lets out a noise of protest and blocks the exit.\nDerek does not have the energy for this. \u201cWhatever breakdown you\u2019re having, do it after I get downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026 Lay down. Sleep, alright?\u201d His eyes flicker over Derek, over the bed. \u201cSome of us aren\u2019t sadistic assholes who get off on watching people suffer, and you\u2026 You\u2019re kind of a walking advertisement to wince right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou once said you\u2019d leave me in the street while I was dying.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, but I was frustrated and kidding. Admittedly, maybe not my best comedic timing, but who would really do that?\u201d\n\u201cMost people,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles stares at him with his mouth open, like it\u2019s a genuine surprise. \u201cJesus,\u201d he finally says.\nAfter a beat of silence, he gestures half-heartedly over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean up and then sleep. Downstairs. Yell if you need something.\u201d\nHe\u2019s out the door long before Derek has any idea what to say.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time he wakes up, he\u2019s mostly back in one piece. With his head clear, it\u2019s obvious how badly wrong this has all gone. There are boundaries that need reinforcement. He only hears one other heartbeat in the house, and he\u2019s going to make an educated guess based on the early morning light that he and Stiles are still alone. He makes it to the bathroom with only a slight limp, and by the time he\u2019s done there are jeans and a t-shirt laid out on the bed. Judging by the fit, they\u2019re Stiles\u2019 dad\u2019s. Derek\u2019s pulling the shirt on when Stiles sighs from the doorway.\nHe\u2019s holding up one of the towels Derek hadn\u2019t had the energy to keep track of last night. \u201cI forgot you were born in a barn.\u201d\nI was born at home, he thinks. Sixteen hours of labor, and Laura had teased him about being antisocial from the womb. His mother had always called him her shy boy.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says instead, smiling with teeth. \u201cBut I was raised by wolves.\u201d\nStiles opens his mouth, then closes it and glares. \u201cImpossibly, you\u2019re actually more terrifying when you tell jokes.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you getting too comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d He flails his hands. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve actively tried to kill and/or maim people I care about, so believe me I am not sizing us up for friendship bracelets here.\u201d\nDerek may as well ask point blank. \u201cWhat is it you thought you\u2019d get out of this, Stiles?\u201d\nHe makes a frustrated noise through his teeth. \u201cWhat I am getting out of this is the satisfaction of a clear conscience, okay? That\u2019s it.\u201d\nHe\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cFine,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI need to get back to the station.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going back to the train? Really? You don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a super obvious target?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d He\u2019d chosen it in the first place for its multiple potential exits, every one echoing like an alarm system to the right ears. The pack can be long gone before anyone will ever catch them by surprise.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ll storm the castle?\u201d\nThey haven\u2019t had the balls to go after an alpha alone until now, and even then only when he was injured. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the numbers.\u201d\n\u201cWhere have you been? You can\u2019t walk down the street around here without tripping over a hunter lately.\u201d He frowns. \u201cThey\u2019re like tribbles. Scary, armed tribbles.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019re all from different factions. Think of them like mafias \u2013 they work in small groups, usually families, and most of them don\u2019t do alliances.\u201d It can\u2019t hurt to share a little information. \u201cIf they\u2019re not loyal to the same big patron family, they\u2019ll be just as happy to fight each other as us.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Stiles stares at the wall for a minute like he\u2019s slotting this into place, and then shrugs. \u201cWell, far be it from me to prevent your untimely demise twice in twenty four hours. Your clothes are in the bag by the back door. Enjoy your subway cave.\u201d\nIt feels awkward, unfinished. Derek heads downstairs and Stiles trails behind him, like he\u2019s seeing him out. He grabs the garbage bag on his way to the door, but there\u2019s a brown paper sack on top of it. He\u2019s checking inside when Stiles speaks up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sandwich, not a grenade.\u201d He fidgets from against the kitchen counter. \u201cScott always gets the munchies after he has to regenerate his spleen or whatever.\u201d\nDerek blinks, but there\u2019s nothing that comes to mind to do other than nod.\nStiles waves lazily. \u201cLater, Splinter. See, that\u2019s funny, because you\u2019re fuzzy and live underground and herd a bunch of teenagers around \u2013\u201c\nDerek snorts as he walks out, but he can\u2019t help closing the door gently behind himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe betas aren\u2019t at the station when he gets back. He didn\u2019t expect them to be.\nThey still come when he calls, still fight when he tells them to. After everything that\u2019s happened, he\u2019s a long way from their blind trust, but he\u2019s still the devil they know. They\u2019re smart and they\u2019re alive. That was always the goal.\nScott doesn\u2019t come when he calls. He does come when asked about half the time, though. Derek\u2019s starting to realize that it\u2019s possible the most they can aim for is sorting out that other half.\nThe tunnels are quiet, and the damp tile walls hold scent well enough that he knows no one\u2019s been here since Isaac three days ago.\nHe needs to get serious about the hunters. They\u2019ve all been following the letter of the code up to this point, but the big families are the only ones that ever enforced it fully. They\u2019re only waiting for an excuse, now, just one toe across the line. If they can drag that toe over, all the better. He has no doubt they\u2019d have had a cover story for the construction site, some way to conveniently explain how he deserved it. It\u2019s just as likely there\u2019d be no one to ask questions in the first place.\nThe pack can handle itself against an open attack from any particular group of hunters. The trick is in keeping it clear to everyone else that the pack aren\u2019t the aggressors, and avoiding getting picked off one at a time in pitched fights. It\u2019s not an easy trick.\nIf they can stay alive long enough, the hunters without larger families already backing them will go for easier targets. One of the big names will take an interest in the territory, and Derek might have a window to prove that his pack is stable and quiet. If he\u2019s lucky, the Argents might even get their shit together and reassert themselves; it\u2019s the last thing he\u2019d ever thought he\u2019d be rooting for, but they\u2019re the devil he knows.\nThat had been his strategy, at least, until he wound up at the wrong end of a six-story fall. Now, he\u2019s not sure they have the choice of being passive. It might be better to hit first and hard and try to keep it quiet.\nHe feels more like himself these days. It\u2019s a shame. He\u2019d enjoyed being someone else for a while there.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles calls him two days later, just before sundown. \u201cYou need to get over here right now. Discreetly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that, Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cThere is a truck sitting across the street with a couple of guys who scream bad news just watching like stalking stalkers and this is so incredibly your fault.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably true.\n\u201cWait by the back door. Your window\u2019s too visible from the street.\u201d\nTwenty minutes later he\u2019s watching around the edge of the curtains in the Stilinskis\u2019 darkened living room as two hunters stake out the front door. It\u2019s too soon after the construction site to be a coincidence.\n\u201cThey showed up right after Dad left for the night, like they knew his schedule. How long do you think they\u2019ve been watching me? Why are they watching me?\u201d He\u2019s switched between pacing and gnawing on a fingernail for the full time Derek\u2019s been here. Occasionally, maybe for variety, he does both at the same time. \u201cI mean, what the hell?\u201d\nThe hunters haven\u2019t made a move to leave the truck. From what Derek can catch of their conversation, they seem to be rock-paper-scissoring for the last Krispy Kr\u00e8me. Derek steps away from the window. \u201cYou helped me. They took that as a declaration.\u201d\nStiles runs his hands roughly over his head. \u201cHow do I un-declare it?\u201d\nDerek keeps silent. Stiles already knows the answer.\nHis bowed head a second later confirms it. \u201cShit.\u201d\nThat about sums it up.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re watching me, they\u2019ll start looking at everybody around me. Scott, Jackson, Lydia\u2026 If they figure out any of them aren\u2019t normal\u2026\u201d Stiles says. If he keeps rubbing the back of his neck like that he\u2019ll draw blood. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n\u201c'We?\u2019\u201d It trips out of him.\nStiles\u2019 face shuts down. \u201cFine, I get it. Me. My problem. Screw you, too.\u201d\nDerek watches him pace for a while before he tries again. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks, head back in his hands.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything. \u00a0We stay away from each other, and they figure out you\u2019re not worth their time. Try not to be around any of the others when they\u2019re feeling stupid.\u201d\nSkepticism is written all over him. \u201cI\u2019m the original advocate of sticking your fingers in your ears and singing 'til the coast is clear, but you really think that\u2019ll work?\u201d\n\u201cI really think I\u2019m getting rid of them soon.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d The hands on his hips are just obnoxious. \u201cLet me know how that works out for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt turns out Derek doesn\u2019t have to let him know anything. Hitting first would have gone better if this group of hunters hadn\u2019t bought out an army surplus store\u2019s worth of electronic alarms for the block surrounding their warehouse hideout. Simple reconnaissance gets switched to a frantic dash with one interrupted laser beam.\nIt\u2019s just becoming clear how utterly screwed the pack\u2019s retreat is \u2013 the hunters have the advantages of both rooftop high ground and home turf \u2013 when Stiles brakes to a screeching halt in front of them at the mouth of an alley. The betas drag each other into the back without hesitation.\n\u201cWhy does this always happen on my nights on radio watch? Danny takes turns. This could happen on his nights. Why does it never happen then?\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes flicker between mirrors, watching for the hunters that he\u2019ll never see coming.\nDerek jumps in and slams the door. \u201cDrive.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Drive,\u2019 he says.\u201d Stiles keeps bitching, but the Jeep accelerates. \u201cDo you have any idea how inconvenient it is having to save your asses on a school night? While ditching a tail, I might add.\u201d\nErica looks up from poking Isaac\u2019s bruises and smirks. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have sent Scott?\u201d\nStiles sighs. \u201cA) That hurts me, right here,\u201d he lays a hand on his chest, \u201cand B) it kind of defeats the purpose of keeping under the radar to send Scott towards the guys making a list and checking it twice. Seriously, you all suck at Clue, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re pretty awesome at Twister,\u201d Isaac says mildly.\n\u201cNot bad at lacrosse, either,\u201d Boyd adds from his spot under Isaac.\nStiles opens his mouth, and then gives in to a nod. \u201cYeah, touch\u00e9.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t argue when Derek tells him to head for the train, and the only sounds for the rest of the drive are Erica\u2019s huffed laughs every time the boys try to find a better way of arranging themselves.\nWhen they get there, Stiles climbs out like he\u2019s staying with them. Derek blocks his way. \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re joking.\u201d He searches Derek\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re not joking.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, what? Twiddle my thumbs waiting for the next time you and the Pipps need a ride away from certain death?\u201d The set of his jaw is furious.\nDerek doesn\u2019t care. He has all the vulnerable spots he needs. The less Stiles is involved, the less of a target he paints on himself, so Derek crosses his arms and waits.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Stiles breathes out angrily, but he gets back in the Jeep. He\u2019s still grumbling about taxi drivers and tips as his lights disappear around a building.\nBoyd clears his throat from the doorway. He doesn\u2019t say anything else, but he doesn\u2019t need to. Derek heads for the stairs and the frustrating decision of what to do next that waits at the bottom of them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis phone rings at two in the morning with Stiles\u2019 number on the display.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d He\u2019s less than pleasant this late. It\u2019s a character flaw.\nHe gets a distant echo in reply. He\u2019s about to hang up and lament how his life turned into being assdialed by teenagers in the dead of night when a voice comes through. It\u2019s not Stiles\u2019 voice.\n\u201cWe have something of yours. If you want it back, you\u2019ll be at your old house in an hour.\u201d\nHis mind races. The best he can do is stall for time. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\nThe voice chuckles. \u201cAwful loud, isn\u2019t he? Real firecracker.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve made a mistake. Nothing of mine seems to be missing.\u201d He smiles to make sure it comes through in his tone.\nThere\u2019s a sound then, father away from the phone. It\u2019s the distinctive whine of electricity charged and released. Derek fucking hates that sound. A half-beat behind it is a choked scream, and that is in Stiles\u2019 voice.\n\u201cNo, still think you have the wrong number,\u201d Derek says pleasantly, and hangs up.\nHe allows himself one long breath with his eyes closed, and then he dials Boyd.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat the hunters have trapped the house is a given. Also obvious: they\u2019re armed, they\u2019re dangerous, and they\u2019ll be expecting Derek to bring his betas along.\nThere\u2019s nothing he can do about any of it. He sends the others to come in separately through the woods and drives up to the front, parking next to where they\u2019ve stashed the Jeep. One of the hunters \u2013 balding, broad shouldered, shotgun in hand \u2013 is waiting in the open door. He escorts Derek into the living room and then backs away to the far wall.\nStiles is sitting upright in a chair in the center of the space, his arms pulled behind him. There\u2019s duct tape over his mouth, blood from his nose trickling down over it, but his eyes are angrier than they are afraid. That\u2019s good.\nThere\u2019s another hunter, taller and leaner than the first, standing beside the chair. He has a revolver aimed at Stiles\u2019 head and an air of satisfied control to him, and that\u2019s less good.\nThe man smirks. \u201cYou\u2019re a little early.\u201d\n\u201cTraffic\u2019s good this time of night,\u201d Derek says.\nThe man hums in amusement. \u201cCould have been here even sooner if you didn\u2019t bring your pack. That was stupid, by the way.\u201d\nFrom the frustrated sound Stiles makes, he seems to agree. Derek ignores him and cocks his head, letting through a smirk of his own. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cOh, we were ready for them.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t let his eyes flicker to the movement at the window across from him. He\u2019s very careful not to react as the balding hunter standing next to it slumps and is caught, lowered to the floor silently by an arm over the sill.\n\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Derek asks, and lets himself shift.\nThe tall hunter turns his gun on Derek, self-preservation instinct kicking in just a little too late. He fires off a shot when a dart hits him in the neck, but his aim\u2019s off and he drops before he can manage another. Isaac slinks out of the shadows of the kitchen doorway. \u00a0\u201cI like these,\u201d he says, twirling the blowgun through his fingers.\nDerek leaves him to his admiration and works on getting Stiles loose. The second the duct tape is off, though, Stiles is talking. \u201cLess fondling your stick, more running. This isn\u2019t all of them.\u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Erica says as she and Boyd come in through the front door. She\u2019s smirking, but there\u2019s a tension about them both that gets Derek\u2019s attention. \u201cThis crew\u2019s down for the count, but they got off a call to somebody.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d He spares a glance for the hunters on the floor, but they don\u2019t have a choice. If there are more of them out there, he can\u2019t take the chance they won\u2019t start an open war over anything further he does here tonight. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nStiles gets upright and staggers gamely for a few steps before Derek throws an arm around his waist and drags him the rest of the way to the cars. \u201cKeys,\u201d he demands, tossing the Camaro\u2019s to Boyd. Stiles doesn\u2019t even whine about handing them over, although he does grumble when Derek doesn\u2019t finesse second gear to his liking.\nBoyd takes the opposite turn when they get to the main road. Derek watches his mirrors all the way to the Stilinskis\u2019, but no one follows them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles walks into the house under his own power. He doesn\u2019t question it when Derek follows, and doesn\u2019t seem concerned his dad will be back any time soon. Derek doesn\u2019t push it.\nUpstairs, Stiles stalls out for a while, blinking at himself in the bathroom mirror. In good light, the bruising looks minimal. There\u2019s still blood under his nose, but it\u2019s dry; when he grabs for a washcloth, Derek notices for the first time that his knuckles are scraped. He lets him wash his face before shoving him lightly aside. Stiles just perches on the edge of the tub without protest.\nThe first aid kit is where he remembers it being. Stiles hisses when the alcohol hits his skin, but turns his hands over obediently when Derek goes for the fingernail cuts on his palms.\nThe room is so quiet that it\u2019s almost startling when Stiles speaks.\n\u201cWhat was on the darts back there?\u201d\nDerek reaches for the antibiotic cream. \u201cJackson gave a donation.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d He watches Derek\u2019s thumb swipe over his knuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 kind of cool, really. Totally the wrong approach, but cool.\u201d\nThat's irritating as a wasp sting. Derek\u2019s planning to relish the deeply screwed look on that last hunter\u2019s face for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t call the cops?\u201d he asks likes it\u2019s obvious.\nDerek glares. \u201cYou never want to call the cops.\u201d\n\u201cPutting aside how you know that\u2026 I never want to call them when they\u2019re my dad, and when the thing they\u2019re up against is a supernatural shitshow. Asshole kidnappers with guns? Totally their turf.\u201d\nThere are about a dozen ways Derek can see that ending badly. Beacon Hills doesn\u2019t have a swat team, there\u2019s no subtle approach to the house by car, and no one fully human could make it on foot without being noticed, not with the hunters expecting attack. Stiles could have been dead in the middle of Derek\u2019s living room before the cops got within sight of the front door. The thought makes him uneasy.\nStiles, meanwhile, has moved on.\n\u201cSo, do you have an actual plan yet for dealing with these guys, or just a general winging-it strategy?\u201d\n\u201cFigure out where the rest of them are hiding, take them out.\u201d It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s better than the alternative of waiting for an ambush.\nStiles is not gratifyingly impressed. He gapes for a minute and then snaps his mouth closed. He looks, of all things, pissed off. \u201cCould you knock it off with the Evil Mastermind life plan? Because, honestly, not to be mean here, but you suck at it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d is somehow what comes out of Derek\u2019s mouth before his brain catches up.\n\u201cYou fake it awesomely, don\u2019t get me wrong. I mean, I bought it, Scott bought it, your little toothy minions bought the hell out of it.\u201d His movements have gone sharp and clipped, either from anger or from the rest of the night catching up with him. \u201cThing is, everything made a whole lot more sense once I figured out you\u2019re scared shitless most of the time.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s shoulders tighten automatically. He doesn\u2019t have the luxury of fear, and less so the luxury of anyone knowing about it.\nStiles reads his body language and his jaw sets a little more firmly, even as his voice levels out. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I just think we\u2019d cut out a lot of unnecessary tension if we could skip directly to the rational, well thought out decision part.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not actually a bad idea, as much as Derek hates to admit it. He stalls for time putting the kit away under the sink. When he\u2019s done, though, that unwavering look is still fixed on him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 It\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Talking about this is uncomfortable, like picking at a scab. \u201cThe pack\u2026 magnifies everything.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d And that fast, Stiles\u2019 mood shifts like a train switching tracks. Resolve becomes fascination at whiplash speed. \u201cOh, crap. It\u2019s a feedback loop.\u201d He bites his lip. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re all feeling, you just keep bouncing it off each other until something spins you out of it.\u201d\nDerek nods cautiously. \u201cClose enough.\u201d\n\u201cSo when you turned everybody, you were freaking out, and then they were freaking out, and then everyone was freaking out,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2026 makes a lot of sense, actually. I\u2019ve been calling it the Magical Douchebag Effect, but this is better. Does it work the other way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf somebody starts thinking happy thoughts, does everybody get mellow?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Derek acknowledges. \u201cIt\u2019s part of why I went after Scott, why I chose Boyd. They\u2019re calmer.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Okay, then. I can work with this.\u201d Stiles\u2019 face goes very somber. Suspiciously so. \u201cDerek, be the change you want to see in the world.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cOr just the pack. I\u2019d settle for the pack.\u201d\nHe\u2019s swaying slightly in place. With the anger gone out of him, it\u2019s suddenly obvious that there\u2019s not much else keeping him upright. Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cEnough. Plot later, Machiavelli.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a surprise to Derek when Stiles\u2019 knees buckle under him the second he stands up. It is a surprise to Stiles, though, going by the sound he makes when Derek catches him with a hand in the center of his chest.\nStiles blinks. \u201cHello, adrenaline crash, my old friend. Also, I think maybe tasering is painful. Who knew?\u201d\nDerek snorts and pushes him vaguely more vertical. \u201cBed.\u201d\nStiles makes a noise of agreement and straightens a little further himself. Derek keeps a hand ready to prevent another faceplant attempt, but they make it all the way down the hall without incident. Stiles does sink onto the edge of his bed, though, like a puppet with its strings cut.\nDerek ducks out to grab an icepack from the freezer in the kitchen \u2013 he\u2019s somehow not shocked that there are plenty in there \u2013 and comes back to find Stiles hasn\u2019t moved. He has a hunch he\u2019ll fall asleep like that if allowed.\nSighing in resignation, he crouches and reaches for one of Stiles\u2019 feet. He\u2019s tossing one sneaker to the side when Stiles says, \u201cThanks. For coming to get me.\u201d\nHis voice is soft, their heads bowed next to each other. This close, Derek can see his eyelashes smudging into the circles under his eyes, maybe there from the hit earlier, maybe just from weariness. There\u2019s something under his tone, in the scent of him, something subtle and layered that Derek doesn\u2019t recognize.\nDerek eases the other shoe off and backs away.\nStiles slumps over onto the bed and curls his legs in with a light moan. \u201cI\u2019m serious about the anger management, though,\u201d he mumbles into his pillow as Derek\u2019s on his way out of the room. \u201cHow do you feel about yoga?\u201d\nDownstairs, Derek locks the door behind him and heads for the trees behind the house. He doubts they\u2019d try anything else tonight, but it can\u2019t be more than a few hours before Stiles\u2019 dad comes home. It\u2019s easy enough to stay until then.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nScott\u2019s waiting for him in the station when he comes in late the next evening. Derek smells him the second he gets to the door.\nThere\u2019s no point in holding off until he gets down the stairs, not when Scott can hear him from the top. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nAs usual, Scott doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cYou should have called me.\u201d\n\u201cTo do what? We handled it.\u201d\nAnd now that Derek\u2019s at floor level, he can feel the anger coming off him in waves. It\u2019s not until Scott raises his head and pins him with his stare, though, that the fear comes through.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, and you should have called me.\u201d\nHe ought to look like the reckless boy Derek first met. He doesn\u2019t. It makes Derek\u2019s voice quieter than he intends when he says, \u201cI knew we could get him out without exposing you. We need every advantage we can get right now.\u201d\n\u201cNext time \u2013\u201c he starts, but Derek doesn\u2019t let him finish.\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\nScott searches his face for a long moment, and then he nods. He heads for one of the tunnels without another word, and Derek chooses to take it as agreement that he\u2019ll keep his head down for now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe owes Stiles, more than once over; he knows it, and he always pays his dues. With the pack safe for the moment, keeping an eye on him from the end of the street when his father\u2019s away seems like the reasonable thing to do. Stiles doesn\u2019t have to know anything about it.\nThat lasts until his phone buzzes. Stiles opens with, \u201cWere all the other good lurking spots in town taken?\u201d\n\u201cJust passing through.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s like a glacial passage, though, right? Because you\u2019ve been doing it for about three hours now.\u201d\nThere's really nothing to say to that.\nStiles laughs under his breath. \u201cJust get in here. I can turn off some lights, make a blanket fort for you to brood in, if that\u2019ll work.\u201d\nWhen Derek tries the back door a few minutes later, it\u2019s unlocked. \u201cThat was stupid,\u201d he calls out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been open for thirty seconds and I figured my new guardian wereshadow had things covered,\u201d Stiles returns, not bothering to look up from the notebook he\u2019s writing in at the dining room table. The whole surface is covered with a scattering of books and papers, and there\u2019s a radio scanner spitting static low and constant from the sideboard.\nDerek rolls his eyes and pulls out a chair. Twenty minutes later, he\u2019s on the brink of gnawing his own leg off to stay awake. Outside, there would at least be the rest of the world to keep him busy; in here, there\u2019s only Stiles\u2019 regular breathing and the white noise of the scanner and the leak under the downstairs bathroom sink and they\u2019re all conspiring to lull him. Inspiration hits when he remembers the bookshelves in the living room from his last time here. He heads for them like a lifeline, and grabs the first book that\u2019s familiar.\n\u201cOh, thank god. I was getting contact boredom just being in the same room,\u201d Stiles says when he gets back. He tilts his head sideways to read the title. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\u201d\nThat\u2019s hardly fair. \u201cIt\u2019s your book.\u201d\nStiles face softens. \u201cNot mine,\u201d he says quietly. His lips twitch, caught somewhere between smiling and not, and then he shakes it off and clears his throat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t criticizing\u2026 Just...\u201d He waves the conversation away.\nDerek settles in again at the table without explaining and the background noise of the house is perfect for this. He has to stop for a moment when he realizes that he still hears Aslan in his father\u2019s voice. When he glances up, Stiles is watching him. He looks away quickly, though, and Derek goes back to reading.\nHe\u2019s a good chunk of the way through the book when Stiles turns around to crank the radio volume up. Someone over the channel is talking about going for a late dinner on Third Street. Derek watches Stiles for a signal that they need to move, but Stiles catches him looking and shakes his head, reaching for his laptop.\nHe types furiously for a bit, tongue held between his teeth. When Derek leans over his shoulder to look, though, there\u2019s a chart and a map with notations that make no sense whatsoever on the screen.\nStiles nods at his questioning grunt. \u201cEvery hunter group gets a Girl Scout cookie name. We keep track of how many of them there are, where they hang out, all that jazz.\u201c He grins. \u201cIf anybody asks, I\u2019m mapping cookie sales in relation to proximity to scouting centers. Trust me, it won\u2019t be the weirdest off-topic topic they\u2019ve seen from me.\u201d\n\u201cThe ones on the radio are the do-si-dos?\u201d He gets the logic, even if the actual words make him feel idiotic.\nStiles bobs his head. \u201cYep. They\u2019re the easiest to keep an eye on. They\u2019re always in pairs, they\u2019re nuttier than a peanut butter cookie, and they seem to have a pickup fetish.\u201d He points at another line on the chart. \u201cThe tagalongs are the paramilitary types, and the thin mints are the ones who slink around in the black jumpsuits like ninja wannabes. Credit where credit\u2019s due, they really are kind of a bitch to track.\u201d\nDerek looks at the map again. Some of it matches up with what the pack\u2019s managed to observe, but some of it\u2019s new information.\nStiles looks back and forth between Derek and the screen. \u201cYou want a copy?\u201d\nThey spend the rest of the night hunched over their own projects, Derek memorizing the map and Stiles working what look like Trigonometry problems. Eventually, Stiles gives up and announces he\u2019s going to bed, and Derek waves him off without looking up.\nThe tiny map notes all blur together after a few hours, and he settles on the couch with the book instead. Somewhere after three in the morning he lets himself doze for a while, confident he\u2019ll hear anyone trying to get in. When Stiles\u2019 father\u2019s SUV turns onto the block, he slips the book back in place on its shelf and ducks quietly away.\nIt\u2019s a sad commentary on his life that he feels more rested than he has in a while.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second night, the door is unlocked and Prince Caspian is already waiting on his side of the table.\nStiles makes it a full hour without starting a conversation. Derek\u2019s grudgingly amused by the fact that he can see it coming a good ten minutes ahead of time just by the abandoned tics Stiles makes in his direction every thirty seconds or so.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Stiles starts, \u201cso we\u2019ve got the bestiary to help us out with the creature feature side of things, but I feel like there needs to be a textbook on hunters, too. And there isn\u2019t. Anywhere.\u201d\nHe gives a suggestive little head tilt in Derek\u2019s direction, eyebrows up and face open like he\u2019s waiting for Derek to run with this. It feels like being called on in class always had. Derek absolutely does not squirm in his seat uncomfortably.\n\u201cYou want me to tutor you in Hunters 101?\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody else volunteering. They\u2019re keeping Allison on the need-to-know schedule, and everything they tell her is going to be pretty heavily written-by-the-victors style. We all need to be on the same page.\u201d\nIt makes sense, at least. It\u2019s still not any easier figuring out where to start. \u201cThere are big families, old names that control it all. They mostly stick to the code and stay out of each others\u2019 way. The newer hunters try to catch someone\u2019s attention until they get brought in under one of the old names. It\u2019s very\u2026 political.\u201d\n\u201cSo our little cupboard of Girl Scout cookies are all newer, trying to make their bones by capping a pack?\u201d\nDerek nods. \u201cThe old families will stay away and play nice, just in case the Argents get their act together again, but unofficially\u2026 Taking us out would be a ticket in with one of them.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re ambitious homicidal jerks. Great. What else?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles flails incredulously. \u201cSeriously? Favorite weapons, standard tactics, what the ever-loving hell is in this code that nobody actually follows\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d If it\u2019s written down anywhere, he\u2019s never seen it. \u201cThey\u2019re not supposed to hunt anyone who hasn\u2019t spilled human blood. There\u2019s more to it, but what the rest is\u2026\u201d He shrugs.\n\u201cBut how can you not know this? It\u2019s your history, right?\u201d\nHis first response is anger. He\u2019s making an effort these days to be more productive, though. \u201cWhat do you know about the War of 1812?\u201d\nStiles looks thrown for all of three seconds. \u201cUs, the Brits, and the National Anthem are pretty much it. Why? Is there a giant werewolf conspiracy at the heart of our country\u2019s founding? Come to think of it, Ben Franklin did look like a fairly fuzzy dude\u2026\u201d\nDerek waits him out until the rabbit trail leads all the way back to the right conversation.\u00a0 Stiles bobs his head to show he\u2019s ready. \u201cWar of 1812. What?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know about it? It\u2019s your history, right?\u201d Derek parrots. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s still a little irritated.\n\u201cTo be fair, the one day we spent on it in fourth grade was in the middle of my Spiderman phase, and we had those little desks with the pocket in the front so you could read things out of Mrs. Jenkin\u2019s view - I made it all the way through to Unlimited before she caught me. Also, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hugely relevant to daily life,\u201d Stiles says, and then his expression clears. \u201cAh. Starting to see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d\n\u201cHunters, the code\u2026 None of it had anything to do with us. We were quiet, we didn\u2019t start trouble\u2026 We thought we were safe.\u201d The last part comes out vicious.\n\u201cThey never taught you how to fight,\u201d Stiles says, like the pieces are coming together. \u201cYou\u2019re learning on the fly.\u201d\n\u201cOur parents taught us how to be people.\u201d On his worst days, he\u2019s still bitter about that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe third night, Stiles walks him into the living room and sits down, looking serious.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he says, fidgeting.\nDerek raises an eyebrow. \u201cLook, if you\u2019d rather get killed, fine, but I\u2019m not coming after you next time.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a depressingly bad lie.\n\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d Pain flickers across his face for a second before he gets back on track. \u201cMy dad, the trained investigator, he\u2019s going to notice some guy lurking around eventually, and he\u2019s definitely going to have issues with it being a guy he arrested a couple of times. The creepy assholes who keep following me need an excuse for us to know each other that does not involve me being a lightening rod for every supernatural being in town. We need a cover story.\u201d\n\u201cSo say we\u2019re friends.\u201d It\u2019s a simple enough lie.\nStiles\u2019 expression says otherwise. \u201cI know you don\u2019t exactly cohabitate with \u2018normal,\u2019 but seriously? Friends who prowl around in abandoned buildings and have slumber parties and oh goddammit that might actually work.\u201d He\u2019s the first person Derek\u2019s ever seen pull off despairing enlightenment. \u201cI hate my life.\u201d\nDerek raises the other eyebrow and waits him out.\nStiles buries his face in his hands. \u201cLove makes you do the wacky.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d When in doubt, it\u2019s the single syllable that serves him best around Stiles.\n\u201cLine from a TV show. Oh god, I\u2019m explaining this to a guy who lives like an Amish man with a leather fetish. Why?\u201d\n\u201cTV\u2026 That\u2019s the magic box with the people inside, right?\u201d Derek deadpans.\nStiles lifts his head, eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cYou just like to screw with us, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nIf Derek\u2019s lips curve up at the corners, nobody can prove it. \u201cBack to your master plan.\u201d\nAnd Stiles snaps into it like a rubber band released. \u201cRight. Look, just\u2026 I am aware of exactly how this sounds, and believe me I would like to strangle myself pre-emptively here, but try not to get your furry panties in a bunch. Here it is: I think I need to date you.\u201d\n\u201cReally.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t make it a question.\n\u201cWell, you\u2026 look like that, and my track record for good decision making hasn\u2019t been great in the public sphere, and nobody really knows you well enough to anticipate your brand of crazy, so\u2026 I think people might buy it? Briefly?\u201d He winces. \u201cAt least people who know us from behind the barriers of disappointed parenthood and creepy stalker binoculars, respectively?\u201d\nThere is so much wrong with this Derek doesn\u2019t know where to start. Unfortunately, all the tailspin between his ears catches on the way down is, \u201cAnd you think your dad will take this well?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d He laughs bitterly. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to chalk it up as another of my recent epic fails as a son, but I also think he\u2019ll want to keep the closest eye humanly possible on both of us, which might also stop the hunters from making a move.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re underage,\u201d Derek tries.\n\u201cDude, you haven\u2019t even bought me dinner yet.\u201d Stiles snorts. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s a level of verisimilitude we don\u2019t need to aim for. You can\u2019t get arrested for something you haven\u2019t done.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t even have to say it. Stiles\u2019 brain visibly catches up with his mouth. \u201c\u2026 and that\u2019s not something I should be saying to a former fugitive of the law. Got it.\u201d And Derek almost thinks he\u2019s given up, until Stiles lets out a slow breath and drops all the humor from his expression. \u201cLook, I\u2019m open to suggestions, but this is all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\nDerek crosses his arms. \u201cThis is a terrible plan.\u201d\n\u201cIt really, really is,\u201d Stiles agrees.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou might as well use the front door this time, Stiles texts him late in the afternoon.\nWhen he gets there, the former Sheriff of Beacon Hills answers his knock.\n\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, I\u2019m not remotely okay with this. You\u2019re here because, out of all the ways he could be inventing trouble right now, you\u2019re easiest to monitor.\u201d\nDerek nods. He\u2019s sure there\u2019ll be more.\nThere is. \u201cGood. Here are the rules: When you\u2019re together, it\u2019s under my roof. I\u2019m not stupid enough to think I can keep you out of the house when I\u2019m not here, and the damage he can do here is minimal. If his grades slip, you\u2019re gone. If he breaks any more laws, you\u2019re gone. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he says, fighting not to be surreally amused.\nStilinksi reads his expression, and then nods sharply. His shoulders relax as he turns and heads for the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing some eggs for dinner before I head out. Join me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a request, but it\u2019s not hostile, either. Derek follows as much for entertainment value as anything else. Stilinski already has the pan heating and the carton out on the counter. He looks ridiculously domestic in jeans, spatula in hand.\n\u201cScrambled okay?\u201d He waits for Derek\u2019s nod before turning back to the stove. \u201cOh, and did you kill Kate Argent?\u201d\nDerek feels himself freeze. The absolute lack of his breathing is obvious, even over the sizzle of the eggs. There\u2019s no way Stilinski doesn\u2019t notice it. \u201cNo.\u201d\nStilinski nods and stirs the pan. \u201cBut you knew she arranged that fire, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a badge anymore, and not many friends left at the department.\u201d He turns to stare straight at Derek\u2019s face. \u201cSo if anything happens to my son because of you, you won\u2019t be going to jail.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the plainest, most sincere threat anyone\u2019s ever made against him. Derek could have this man dead before he hit the floor. His lips twitch involuntarily.\n\u201cSomething funny?\u201d Stilinski asks calmly.\n\u201cYou just reminded me of him,\u201d Derek says, and oddly enough, it\u2019s a compliment.\nStilinski sits back and watches him. Derek lets himself be watched.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stilinski says finally, and reaches for dishes.\nWhen they\u2019re done with the most silently uncomfortable meal Derek\u2019s ever had \u2013 and that is a strangely long list \u2013 Stilinski leaves a covered plate of leftovers in the fridge before he heads out. It\u2019s a telling gesture, as is the way he frowns and flicks his eyes to the staircase as he\u2019s smoothing the plastic wrap in place.\nDerek waits a few minutes after he\u2019s gone to find Stiles in his room. He\u2019s flat on his back on the bed, arms at his sides and eyes on the ceiling.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he says without moving.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Derek says, and ignores the white knuckles of Stiles\u2019 hands.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStilinski\u2019s car is gone the next evening. Derek is just as glad to avoid the awkward parental interaction, although the food had been good. He skips the door altogether and heads for Stiles\u2019 open bedroom window. He\u2019d make a point about that, but honestly, if the hunters made it as far as the roof, a pane of glass wouldn\u2019t do much anyway.\nStiles waves when he climbs over the sill, but doesn\u2019t look away from the computer screen he\u2019s glaring at.\nDerek glances at it. \u201cI thought Lydia\u2019d finished translating the bestiary.\u201d\nStiles nods, still frowning at the text. \u201cYep. And now it\u2019s my pain in the ass to deal with. This would be so much easier if they\u2019d just rhymed everything. You know, like, \u2018Leprechauns ain\u2019t funny, they\u2019ll kill you for their money,\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 memorizing it? All of it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea. It\u2019s slow going, but I figure it\u2019ll be worth it, if only so that when the next big bad shows up I can scream out the right name as it eats me.\u201d\nThe bed looks like the best option for working space, so Derek spreads the hunters map and notes out and settles in to look for patterns. There might be something about the way the tagalongs and the do-si-dos are never in the same part of town at the same time. Maybe they\u2019re particularly hostile with one another.\nHe\u2019s trying to put his finger on why that doesn\u2019t quite feel right when he senses eyes on him. Stiles is all the way turned around in his chair, staring like he\u2019s been doing it for a while, and his expression is somewhere between manic and hopeful. Derek braces himself.\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve been thinking about the whole feedback loop of doom problem, and I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it involve Kumbaya?\u201d Derek asks with healthy skepticism.\n\u201cSee, that! That right there!\u201d His flail takes in most of Derek. \u201cThere are these moments where I kind of almost like you, and I can\u2019t like you because you\u2019re an evil dick. So it\u2019s either get you to stop having those moments or get you to stop being an evil dick, and while the first one is probably easier, the second one is probably better in the long run.\u201d\nHe spreads his arms wide like a ringmaster. \u201cConsider this your Evil Dick Intervention.\u201d\nThis is the problem with Stiles. Violent threats only work about 10% of the time with him and Derek never quite knows what to say the other 90%. Silence only serves as encouragement.\nCase in point: \u201cYou need a hobby,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek\u2019s left eye twitches without warning. Stiles sees it and nods.\n\u201cYeah, hear me out. Every time things go to shit in this town, I almost die. In the interests of not dying, it would help a lot if everyone would just chill the hell out, right?\u201d His wide eyes are full of anticipation.\nDerek\u2019s going to regret letting this play out, he knows he is, but it\u2019s like watching a train crash in slow motion. Stiles keeps going regardless.\n\u201cThe way I see it, it\u2019s not entirely your fault that you\u2019re kind of destructive and terrifying.\u201d He waves off Derek\u2019s glare. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a boatload of issues, I get that, and it\u2019d go better for pretty much everyone if you had some healthy channels to express yourself. You get less cranky, the pack gets less cranky, maybe the hunters get less cranky, maybe we all live to see 30.\u201d\n\u201cThere are diagram of this somewhere, aren\u2019t there?\u201d Derek asks out of sick fascination.\n\u201cExcel is my bitch,\u201d he agrees. \u201cSo what we\u2019re going to do is wean you off bloodshed. Like cigarettes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201d He carries a lighter because it\u2019s practical, not because he has any desire to smell like ashes.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s both surprising, given your otherwise obsessive adoption of the Traditional Badass Code, and commendable. Your body is a temple.\u201d His eyes do a weird skip over Derek then, too quick to parse. \u201cBut I was going more symbolic, there, actually. They don\u2019t make patches for violence withdrawal, so you need another substitute.\u201d\nDerek follows the thread back to the beginning. \u201cA hobby.\u201d\n\u201cA hobby.\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cLike\u2026 macrame, or motorcycle racing, or Monopoly. And those are just the Ms! There is a whole alphabet of fun, non-homicidal activities out there just waiting for you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t have time in your busy schedule between \u2018copious bleeding\u2019 and \u2018perfecting werewolf Blue Steel\u2019?\u201d He takes in Derek\u2019s expression and sighs. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, this could help. What could it hurt, right?\u201d\nWhen Derek\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change, Stiles sighs again and swivels the chair back around. \u201cOption B: Continue Being an Evil Dick it is, then. Don\u2019t think this is over, though.\u201d\nHis attention goes back to the bestiary, and his shoulders hunch in as he squints at something. After a while, he clearly forgets Derek\u2019s there and starts mumbling around a pencil about the horrors of Latin declensions. Eventually even that trails off.\n\u201cMusic,\u201d Derek says into the silence, not entirely sure why.\nStiles hums distracted agreement. \u201cYeah, I can put something on. Requests?\u201d\n\u201cMusic is a hobby.\u201d\nAnother hum, cut short as he whips his head around with a surprised grin. \u201cYes! Yes, it is. You didn\u2019t have to stick with the Ms, but hey. Progress. You want to start with concert tickets?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek grits out. \u201cMusic is what we did.\u201d\nStile waves encouragement and his grin widens. \u201cLike, in your garage? Because that would explain a lot about the leather jackets, honestly\u2026\u201d He trails off, gazing somewhere into the distance.\n\u201cLike at school. My parents signed us up in first grade.\u201d\nStiles blinks once, long and slow. \u201cYou\u2026 were in the band. The school band. Where there are band geeks \u2013 oh my god you were a band geek, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t have to take this. \u201cIt was an orchestra. Music is good for discipline. We played sports, too, when we got old enough to fake it.\u201d\nStiles is not deterred. \u201cLet me guess, you were a drum guy.\u201d His face does something unholy. \u201cOr, no. Flugelhorn. Tell me you picked the flugelhorn.\u201d\nDespite himself, Derek snorts. \u201cThe idea wasn\u2019t to encourage hitting things. Or to scar us for life.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 grin mellows but sticks around. \u201cSo, what was it? What instrument soothed the savage beast?\u201d\nAnd Derek opens his mouth to say it, and finds gravel in his throat where the word should be. It must show on his face, because Stiles\u2019 expression has sobered by the time Derek finally forces it out. \u201cViolin.\u201d\nHe\u2019s still expecting a joke, something about how delicate he isn\u2019t, maybe, but Stiles just sits back. \u201cHuh,\u201d he says eventually, and when Derek checks, he\u2019s looking at Derek\u2019s hands.\nStiles has the rare ability to make Derek uncomfortable with silence.\n\u201cLaura played the cello. When we needed the money and we didn\u2019t think the hunters were close, we\u2019d play for tips.\u201d\n\u201cBet New York was good for that.\u201d It\u2019s not mocking, just conversational.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to explain that New York was just the last stop on the road, that the Hale on his driver\u2019s license had been an act of defiance. \u201cNo,\u201d he says in the end. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe for us to stay in the same place with each other for very long.\u201d\nIt\u2019s cold comfort to know that he\u2019d been right, that they should have stayed together and on the move. Looking back, that was the first battle he should have fought harder.\nStiles tilts his head. \u201cShe took it seriously, looking out for you.\u201d His voice is thoughtful.\nDerek hears the criticism in it anyway. \u201cMaybe if she hadn\u2019t she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\nHe stares at the floor until Stiles goes back to his reading.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow that he\u2019s aware he should be looking, the traps in town are easier to spot. The parking garage basement on the east side suddenly has a working surveillance camera system where there used to be dummies in place; the old rec center, abandoned since the new one opened, has tripwires on the doors; three low-traffic warehouses on the south edge of town are seeing a lot more action, judging by the footprints in the dust. The hunters are smart enough to cover their scent, but there\u2019s not much they can do about dirt.\nHe makes notes on the back of Stiles\u2019 map, adds the betas\u2019 observations when he meets with them, Scott\u2019s when he calls to check in. He\u2019s trying to limit contact between all of them as much as possible for now. There\u2019s no sense advertising anything, not with this kind of scrutiny. If any of the hunters haven\u2019t got the memo identifying Erica, Isaac, Boyd, or Scott, he\u2019s not going to make it any easier.\nIt leaves him with more free time in the average day than he honestly knows what to do with. He trains, he makes plans that he can\u2019t put into play without provoking an attack, he buys a few books on tactical strategy\u2026 When he finds himself making an attempt to straighten up the train car, it\u2019s clear a change of scenery can\u2019t hurt.\nThe empty Stilinski house is tempting from his cramped seat in the Camaro. He makes it through another hour with Small Unit Leadership: A Commonsense Approach propped on the steering wheel before he gives in. The house is still ridiculously easy to break into, and there\u2019s a perfect reading chair in the living room.\nStiles doesn\u2019t even blink when he eventually walks in after practice. He drops his backpack at the doorway and trudges straight past Derek with a grunt.\n\u201cLydia thinks this plan is hilarious. She keeps waiting until we\u2019re surrounded by large crowds of people to ask targeted questions about our sex life. Which, if anyone asks, is non-existent because I am waiting for marriage.\u201d He keels over onto the couch in a dramatic flop. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nDerek feels for him. Really. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d\nStiles lifts his head from the pillow. \u201cI am Lydia Martin\u2019s sassy bi BFF. How is this my life?\u201d He drops back down. \u201cAgain, fuck.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you liked spending time with her?\u201d Derek tries for innocent, but he doesn\u2019t try all that hard.\n\u201cIt is because of you that I am never going to get laid in this lifetime, so you can just stop with the judgments, okay?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes. \u201cWe get clear of the hunters, have a public break-up, and someone takes pity on you in the aftermath. Lydia will get distracted eventually.\u201d\nStiles groans. \u201cHave you met Lydia?\u201d Then he cocks his head. \u201cWait, have you met Lydia? I mean, aside from the odd homicidal quest here and there, have you ever been formally introduced?\u201d\nDerek opens his mouth to answer, but Stiles cuts him off. \u201cJesus, what am I saying? That\u2019s like offering to hook up gunpowder and gasoline; there would be no survivors.\u201d He shudders.\nDerek wonders, idly, which one he is.\n\u201cHell of a lightshow, though,\u201d he says, just to watch Stiles\u2019 wheels spin.\nHe waits until Stiles gets up to head for the kitchen and then stretches out on the couch. Stiles grumbles satisfyingly when he comes back, but relocates to the chair without staging a real protest.\nSmall Unit Leadership is amazingly dry. The third time Derek reads the same page without catching any of it, he has to admit it\u2019s not working. He\u2019s got a choice of leaving his stolen spot unguarded to wake himself up with movement, or to rest his eyes for a while.\nIt\u2019s tempting. The evening light is honey-colored through the curtains, and the house is comfortably warm. He\u2019ll hear if there\u2019s trouble; the last time he slept deeply enough to be a problem, Laura had been in the next room.\nHe lays the book on the coffee table and closes his eyes.\nHe wakes up with the smell of smoke in his head. It\u2019s been a while since he had that one. He listens around the house, just to be sure, but there\u2019s nothing out of place.\nHe hadn\u2019t known what his home smelled like after the fire until he came back to town, but he\u2019d been coming pretty close while asleep for years. From experience, he knows his best method it to replace all of it with the sensory input of whatever place he\u2019s in. Scent is the hardest to convince, so he leaves it for last.\nHe\u2019d curled into himself while he slept, but one of his hands is pressed against the cushion by his head. It\u2019s easier, with the couch under him being leather. Leather is irregular and imperfect, real in a way cotton never is. He lets his fingertips explore the soothing unpredictability of it.\nStiles\u2019 breathing is slow, deep ins and outs through his mouth. It\u2019s the clearest sound in the room, and Derek tilts his head on the pillow to look at him. He\u2019s asleep. His face is tucked into the back of the chair, and his throat is one long, exposed line in the low light through the windows. He\u2019s sprawled gracelessly, shoulders loose and one hand dangling over the edge of the seat, the other on his belly. His fingers jerk, not content to be still. He shouldn\u2019t look comfortable, but somehow he does.\nDerek lies there for a while longer, letting leather and house dust and the sleep-warm scent of another body crowd out the smoke, and then he heads for the kitchen to find dinner.\nHe\u2019s quiet about it, though. There\u2019s no reason not to let Stiles be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not all the time. Stiles stays over at Scott\u2019s occasionally, and his father only works half the week. There\u2019s no reason to be on watch those nights.\nStiles\u2019 dad seems to be thawing a little on Derek, although why remains a mystery. The last few nights he\u2019s even seemed almost relieved to have him there, which is both new and confusing.\nThis time, he waves Derek in on his own way out the door, and Derek watches him stand in the driveway for a long moment before leaving. Derek shrugs off the disquiet and heads upstairs, tracking Stiles by the light and sound spilling out of his open bedroom door.\nHe finds him sitting cross-legged on the floor with papers and textbooks radiating out in all directions. He\u2019s sucking on his lower lip in concentration and one index finger is absently keeping time with the music coming from his computer. It\u2019s a classical piece, intimately familiar despite Derek not having heard it in years. Massanet\u2019s Meditation, although he\u2019s never caught anyone else so inclined to break the rule of down-bow on it.\nDerek sucks in a breath as he realizes why.\nStiles\u2019 head snaps up, and his mouth falls open like he wasn\u2019t expecting him yet. \u201cI found some recordings in the band library at school,\u201d he says faintly, after a moment.\nDerek\u2019s vaguely aware of the way Stiles\u2019 eyes follow him across the room, of the tension that sparks through Stiles like a live wire, but he\u2019s more aware of the music. The recording quality isn\u2019t perfect, but his breath falls in line with the phrasing all the same.\n\u201cYou were good,\u201d Stiles says, surprised and quiet with it.\nDerek listens, and refuses to feel the slip of strings under his fingertips. In a little town in Iowa there\u2019s a safety deposit box under a name that isn\u2019t Hale. His violin is tucked in the back; for a while, he thought he\u2019d go back for it, but he knows better now.\nThe piece ends, and there\u2019s the applause of a small-town audience. The memory of who would have been in the crowd that night makes him close his eyes and try to pick the sound of them out of the rest.\nThey\u2019d had band practice after school on Thursdays, him and Laura. He\u2019s never been sure whether Kate knew that or not when she picked her moment.\nIt\u2019s the last track on the recording. Something current with a low, soft voice comes on after, and the vice around Derek\u2019s chest eases a little. \u201cI\u2019ll burn you a copy,\u201d Stiles says, and then flinches at his own word choice.\nDerek nods, not trusting his speech yet. Eventually, he crouches over the papers spread on the floor in search of something to break the awkwardness. Most of it looks like homework, but next to a Spanish textbook there\u2019s an open folder with a mugshot paperclipped to the cover.\n\u201cOne of the hunters has a record?\u201d It\u2019s rare; the ones that are both sloppy enough to get caught and unconnected enough to have charges stick don\u2019t stay in the business long. This could be good news.\nStiles hums distractedly, but his focus sharpens as soon as he spots what Derek\u2019s looking at. His quick slap to shut the file isn\u2019t subtle. \u201cNo. No, that\u2019s\u2026 something else.\u201d\nThe evasion is infuriating, all the more so for how raw his nerves are at the moment. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted us all on the same page. If there\u2019s more going on here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with wolf stuff, okay?\u201d He looks at the folder, and then up at Derek. It\u2019s another long, held minute before he seems to come to a decision. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my dad\u2019s old cases.\u201d\nDerek cocks his head and lets his expression ask for more.\n\u201cOne of the other deputies when Dad first started here, Sullivan\u2026 He was into some really dirty stuff, had a lot of debts to bad people, and Dad brought him up on charges. He\u2019s out on parole. No big, right, but there was this whole thing where he made some threats against Dad way back, and we had a cruiser on watch for a couple weeks. It was a mess. My mom,\u201d and that specific catch in his voice is starting to be familiar, \u201cshe freaked out once when I went over to Scott\u2019s without telling her. Drove me everywhere for a month.\u201d\nDerek glances away from his face. \u201cYou think he\u2019s coming back?\u201d\n\u201cDad thinks so. He kept a copy of Sullivan\u2019s file \u2013 which, hey, you\u2019re really not supposed to do \u2013 and I found it on his desk yesterday. Put together the rest on my own.\u201d\nIt\u2019s none of his business, but Derek reaches for the file anyway. Stiles doesn\u2019t fight him over it. Sullivan is a nasty piece of work; it shouldn\u2019t still surprise him how vicious even normal people can be.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Stiles keeps his eyes on the floor. \u201cI mean, he might not have told me before, but now\u2026 Now I wonder if it\u2019s more like he\u2019s trying to keep the delinquent kid that got him fired out of the way, you know?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not impossible. Derek\u2019s not a fan of empty white lies. \u201cHe cares about you,\u201d he says instead, because that much is just fact.\nStiles doesn\u2019t look any less miserable. \u201cIt might be easier if he didn\u2019t,\u201d he says quietly.\nDerek doesn\u2019t have anything to say to that. He realizes his hand is going unconsciously for Stiles\u2019 shoulder and checks the movement in surprise. His arm hovers there awkwardly, wavering between following through and backing down.\nAfter a beat, though, Stiles visibly shakes off his mood. He squares his shoulders, and his face settles into determined lines. \u201cOkay, screw this. To the kitchen,\u201d he commands, standing up.\nDerek follows him downstairs out of sheer confusion.\nStiles flips the kitchen light on and heads forward like a man on a mission. \u201cThere will be cookies. Kind of like \u2018There Will Be Blood,\u2019 but with more chocolate chips and less terrifying milkshake analogies.\u201d He\u2019s talking to the inside of the fridge. \u201cSeriously, I couldn\u2019t order a chocolate malt for months. It was awful.\u201d\nDerek laughs under his breath and sets the oven to preheat automatically. When he turns around, Stiles is watching him like he\u2019s done a neat trick.\n\u201cI grew up in a house, you know,\u201d he says tightly.\nStiles\u2019 expression shifts into something harder to identify. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m starting to get that.\u201d\nFor a long moment neither of them moves. Stiles shakes it off first and goes for a cookie sheet. He slaps spoonfuls of dough onto it with enthusiasm, popping the utensil in his mouth as he heads for the oven.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get Salmonella,\u201d Derek warns.\n\u201cHonestly, you think any of us are going to get knocked off by something that mundane?\u201d He holds out the spoon. \u201cLive dangerously.\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes and takes it. It\u2019s childish, but he will not be beaten by a lump of dough. Stiles grins like he can read him loud and clear. Derek would like to say something about having eaten far worse things raw, but that\u2019s just inviting a joke that will require retaliation of the physical kind and he doesn\u2019t feel like following through.\nHe licks the spoon clean just to be annoying and lays it deliberately on the counter. Stiles turns away quickly to check the oven. For a second there\u2019s a hint of something different in the air, but its lost under the smell of the cookies the second Stiles opens the oven door.\nIt hits Derek then, mouth full of melting chocolate and sugar, how much he enjoys this. He goes still as it also registers that it\u2019s the very first time he\u2019s ever thought of Stiles as a threat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the hunters go after Scott on a Friday night, it\u2019s almost a relief.\nStiles\u2019 Biology homework has somehow segued into a discussion of the finer mechanics of werewolf transformation, and Stiles has somehow convinced Derek to shift his fangs repeatedly in the name of science. His jaw is just starting to ache with it when Stiles\u2019 text alert chimes. Stiles takes one look at it and freezes, and Derek goes on alert. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nHe shoves the phone at Derek wordlessly and scrambles for his keys.\n\nat swings w A. GI joes here. \n\nDerek\u2019s moving for the door when Stiles makes a confused sound. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nThere\u2019s really no point in denying it. \u201cHelping.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d He shrugs into a jacket. \u201cLook, buzzcuts, camo? Sounds more like tagalongs than our nutty nighttime audience. We can\u2019t cross the streams, dude. I\u2019ve got a legit reason to be hanging out with Scott that doesn\u2019t involve him secretly having fangs; you don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t know yet, I\u2019m not giving them a hint.\u201d\nAs usual, he\u2019s irritatingly right. \u201cFine. Call if there\u2019s trouble.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear me screaming like a rabid hyena,\u201d Stiles vows, and then he\u2019s out the door.\nThe house is conspicuously quiet.\nHe\u2019s planning to wait on the couch with a book, only he can\u2019t settle. He changes titles three times, gets up to grab a drink from the kitchen, then goes back for a snack. The crawling, uneasy shiver under his skin doesn\u2019t let up. It\u2019s about the time that he realizes he\u2019s pacing the house like a caged animal that he decides to go for a drive instead. The usual pickup is even helpfully gone from its spot in front of the house.\nHe makes it as far as the Camaro before the shiver turns into a twist in his gut and he knows it\u2019s more than just nerves. Scott\u2019s in real trouble. If they\u2019re lucky, Stiles isn\u2019t yet.\nAny hope he\u2019s got for that dies the second he gets close enough to the elementary school to see Stiles\u2019 Jeep in the lot and a familiar pickup blocking it in. There\u2019s nobody in either vehicle, or within eyesight. He parks far enough away and with enough cover that he\u2019ll have a shot at the element of surprise.\nHe\u2019s barely out of the car, though, when Erica melts out of the shadows behind him.\n\u201cYou felt it?\u201d he asks, and she nods. She looks nervous, but under control; the last few months have been good for that, at least.\n\u201cBoyd and Isaac are doing recon,\u201d she says. On cue, they slip around the school building and head straight for Derek. Both of their faces are grim.\nBoyd doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThey\u2019re holed up in one of the kindergarten rooms. At least ten of them, mix of the pickup guys and the army types. They\u2019re armed to the teeth and they definitely know Scott\u2019s one of us. Doesn\u2019t look like anybody\u2019s hurt yet, but they\u2019ve got him chained up way better than Allison or Stiles.\u201d\nShit. \u201cAny idea what they\u2019re waiting for?\u201d\nIsaac nods. \u201cReinforcements, and us.\u201d\nIt makes a twisted kind of sense. Neither group has the numbers to go after an alpha or the full pack on their own terms, but together\u2026 It\u2019s a big enough prize to get over their rivalry, apparently.\nThe how of it doesn\u2019t matter much at the moment. They\u2019re fucked if he doesn\u2019t figure something out before the rest of the hunters join the party. The only plan that\u2019s coming to mind is to go in now, hard. He knows Erica and Isaac and Boyd will follow him; he also knows the chances that all of them will make it back out are low. The chances that any of the three currently tied up and defenseless will are worse.\nThe sound of an approaching engine gives him the sinking realization that they\u2019re out of time, right up until he recognizes it. Nothing the hunters drive could mimic a Porsche.\nJackson and Lydia get out of the front, faces set in tandem resolve. Danny unfolds out of the back. \u201cIt was my night on radio watch,\u201d he says wryly.\nAnd just like that they have a chance.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBetween Isaac\u2019s kanima-venom blowgun and the direct application of Jackson\u2019s claws, most of the hunters go down without a fight. It helps that they\u2019re scattered throughout the school on patrol, and that they\u2019re almost as wary of each other as they are of the pack. That last part gives Derek an idea.\nThere\u2019s one tense moment when it\u2019s down to the last three of them in the room with their hostages, but Lydia\u2019s improvised version of a flash-bang grenade turns out to be extremely effective as a distraction.\nStiles and Allison are both out of their handcuffs before the last hunter has hit the primary-colored carpet squares, apparently having been waiting for their chance. Scott remains shackled in a chair proportioned for a five year old while Allison picks his locks, too.\nThe others start piling paralyzed hunters in the middle of the room, buzzcuts on the left and the rest on the right. Erica comes in with rolls of scavenged duct tape and they get to work propping tied-up and gagged hunters in convincingly hostage-like poses.\nStiles rubs his wrists. \u201cI\u2019m guessing this is not about taking up a career in performance art.\u201d\nDerek snorts. \u201cWe need to hurry.\u201d\nHis team knows exactly what they\u2019re doing, and it only takes a few minutes to finish. Stiles visibly takes it all in - the fact that there are three hunters in camo left untied with unloaded guns, the fact that all of the \u201chostages\u201d have longer hair - and lights up with understanding\n\u201cOh. Oh, I see what you did there.\u201d He rubs his hands together gleefully. \u201cThe classic double cross maneuver.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s phone vibrates with the signal from Danny. \u201cTime to go.\u201d\nThey\u2019re all congregated back at the cars by the time the hunters\u2019 reinforcements arrive at the school. It\u2019s recognizable from the satisfyingly enraged shouting and scattered shots.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to keep them occupied for long,\u201d Allison says, sounding worried.\nDerek lets himself smirk. \u201cWait for it.\u201d\nHe knows the second Stiles hears the sirens. His open mouth, ready to launch his own questions, wavers uncertainly and then curves into a slow, wicked grin.\nNext to him, Scott cocks his head. \u201cYou called the cops?\u201d he asks in shock.\nDerek shrugs. \u201cSomeone told me this is their turf.\u201d\nStiles starts laughing, quietly at first and then so hard his shoulders shake. \u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026 that is beautiful.\u201d He bounces on his toes, and Derek has all of a half second to brace for it when he flings himself into his space. It\u2019s a quick, there-and-gone hug, and then Stiles is ricocheting off to sweep Scott up next. \u201cI love everything right now.\u201d\nAllison meets Derek\u2019s gaze from Scott\u2019s other side. She smiles tentatively, but there\u2019s something thoughtful in her eyes. Derek\u2019s not up for deciphering it tonight. \u201cKeep you heads down for now,\u201d he tells the lot of them, just in case. He gets smirks from Erica and Lydia, half of a salute from Isaac, and a raised eyebrow from the barely-re-clothed Jackson. At least Boyd nods seriously.\nDerek snags a hand in the back of Stiles\u2019 shirt and tugs him toward the Camaro. \u201cI\u2019ll drop you off at home.\u201d\nStiles whines, \u201cBut the Jeep\u2026\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t bother to stop towing him along. \u201cIs parked in and currently surrounded by cops.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wind up explaining this to my dad, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He sounds resigned more than surprised.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Derek says, and shoves him lightly at the passenger door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe follows Stiles into the house mostly out of habit. He doubts there\u2019ll be more trouble tonight, in any case.\nStiles heads straight for the dining room and the radio there. He flips it on and they listen to the police channels for a while in the low light coming from the single lamp. If the reports flying back and forth are right, there\u2019s a good chance most of the hunters in town are in custody.\nThey\u2019re both still keyed-up with unspent tension. It works its way out of Stiles in random motions - a leg bouncing under the table, a hand tapping out syncopations against his thigh. He goes to the fridge three times without taking anything out, and finally plunks a glass of juice down in front of Derek absently.\nDerek sips at it for lack of anything better to do and watches him with a touch of amusement. \u201cI\u2019d tell you to have a drink, but your dad\u2019s still a decent shot.\u201d\nStiles snickers. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t heal. You\u2019re just scared he\u2019ll give you the disappointed eyes when you come over.\u201d\nExcept if the hunters are out of the way, Derek doesn\u2019t need to be here. He goes still as the thought settles in.\nStiles gets it, then, too. \u201cHuh. I guess this concludes our regularly scheduled programming.\u201d He shuffles awkwardly in place. \u201cYay?\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s it. Derek should go now. There\u2019s an uncomfortable, unfinished feel to it, though, and for once he knows why. They aren\u2019t even yet. He stalls for time, rubbing over the rim of the glass in thought. A drop of juice collects on his thumb and he absently licks it off.\nStiles\u2019 breath catches, and when Derek looks up his eyes are locked on Derek\u2019s mouth. There\u2019s a warm, salty-sweet hint in the air around him, strong enough that Derek can finally place it. It\u2019s the third time he\u2019s caught that from Stiles, and this time he\u2019s sure. It\u2019s about Derek, for Derek.\nIt\u2019s an answer to the question at the front of his mind, this honey-on-rock-salt trace that could finally settle their score. He ducks his head and allows a smile, relieved to have an easy solution for a change.\nHe watches Stiles from under his lashes as he stands and stalks around the table, slipping into character, advance as deliberate and smooth as he can make it. Stiles frowns in confusion and takes a step back for every one Derek takes forward.\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, not the kind of favor I thought you\u2019d go after, but I can work with it.\u201d\n\u201cWha- Hey, no, what are you \u2013\u201c Stiles keeps backing away from him but his eyes track Derek\u2019s mouth and he licks his own lips.\nDerek walks him right into the wall and then some, until there\u2019s an inch between their eyes and less between the rest of them.\n\u201cI thought.\u201d Stiles swallows with a dry click. \u201cI thought we agreed you\u2019d stop with the big bad wolf routine.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says, \u201cbut I can be very good.\u201d\nEven in this light, he can see Stiles' pupils blow wider. Derek fits his hands to Stiles' hips and nudges a knee between his legs in reward. Stiles\u2019 head drops back with a soft whine.\nAnd this, this is not the worst thing Derek\u2019s done. Not even the worst he\u2019s done lately. It\u2019s not a hardship to give Stiles this. He rests his nose in the hollow behind Stiles\u2019 ear and takes a hit of the bar soap and clean sweat and faint grass smell of him, still there under the electric rush of sex.\n\u201cMy, what big eyes you have,\u201d he whispers against skin.\n\u201cWait, wait.\u201d The roll of his hips into Derek\u2019s says the opposite. His breath hitches when Derek\u2019s thumb slips under his shirt. \u201cFavor?\u201d\nDerek traces a knuckle down the trail on Stiles' belly and gets a low moan for it. He hides his satisfied grin in one collarbone\u2019s hollow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think my mouth can cover my debts?\u201d\nHe\u2019s focused enough on the flush he can taste scattering ever lower that it takes a moment to realize the muscles under his hands have gone rigid.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. Breathes in, and then stronger, \u201cNo. Stop.\u201d\nWhen Derek pulls back, there\u2019s no give in Stiles\u2019 expression.\n\u201cWhatever it is you think this is supposed to be, whatever it is you think I want, it\u2019s not this. Back off,\u201d he says, and Derek steps away from him.\nStiles wants, Derek can still feel it coming off him like a hook set between his own ribs, but he\u2019s also not lying. He doesn\u2019t want Derek. Every line of his body is screaming not to be touched.\nDerek\u2019s worked hard to be the monster under the bed ever since he realized all the other roles were full, but it never seemed to take with Stiles. That maybe he got there in the end after all hits him like a bucket of cold water now.\nDerek backs across to the door slowly and Stiles watches him from against the wall the whole way.\n\u201cFind me when you figure out what it is you\u2019d rather have,\u201d Derek says finally as he eases outside.\nHe listens until he\u2019s out of range, but Stiles never says a word.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019d planned it out right at the very beginning, how this whole act would end. It needs to be in public, with plenty of witnesses, and the more final, the better.\nIt\u2019s easy enough to keep his end of the deal. Derek shows up in the school parking lot over lunch hour, and Stiles picks up his cues flawlessly. Stiles\u2019 father\u2019s disapproval, their different lives, and Derek\u2019s emotional unavailability all make loud cameos. It\u2019s a little Hollywood, but not bad considering neither of them has ever had a normal breakup to their name.\nThe only hitch comes when someone in their audience makes a crack about Stiles not putting out just loud enough to be heard. The color drains from Stiles\u2019 face, and Derek stumbles off rhythm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you,\u201d Stiles says in the end.\nDerek isn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to believe that. He\u2019s not sure if it would even be better if he could.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe local news covers the showdown at the elementary school and the surviving hunters\u2019 arrests as a bizarre gang war. The unregistered weapons violations alone take up a few pages. He\u2019s not sure who came up with that angle, but it works in the pack\u2019s favor. The Sheriff\u2019s Department takes a special interest in anyone unfamiliar coming through town, and Derek stops catching sight of hunters around every corner. If there are others left, they\u2019re staying under the radar. No new tracks appear around the warehouses downtown, and the tripwires at the old rec center aren\u2019t reset after he disables them.\nThings get quiet. It\u2019s the first time since he became Alpha that there\u2019s been no looming threat. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. He keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop; if there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s learned, it\u2019s to never doubt the world\u2019s supply of crises. More often than not, he winds up prowling around town or the woods like he can walk off the prickle under his skin.\nWhen he comes back to the train station two weeks in and gets hit at the door with the twin scents of Stiles and anxiety, it\u2019s almost comforting. Disaster he can handle.\nStiles is hunched over on one of the old crates on the ground floor, waiting for him. The second he catches Derek\u2019s steps on the stairs, though, he\u2019s on his feet and meeting him at the bottom.\n\u201cYou realize being here cancels out everything we did, right?\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cYeah, not so much giving a damn right now,\u201d Stiles returns. His hand is fidgeting in the cuff of his hoodie sleeve; as Derek gets closer, it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s been biting his nails again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Scott done?\u201d It\u2019s unfair, maybe, given how much he\u2019s grown up in the last year, but there are a limited number of things that can put Stiles in this kind of state, and none of Derek\u2019s pack feel like they\u2019re actively in pain right now. Scott\u2019s the best bet for a slow-burn crisis.\nStiles shakes his head, though. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 He\u2019s fine. They\u2019re all okay, I think.\u201d He licks his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad.\u201d\nThat\u2019s definitely on the list of those limited things. Derek just hadn\u2019t expected to be involved, in that case.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t touched his backup gun since they fired him.\u201d Stiles swallows. \u201cHe\u2019s been carrying it the last two days.\u201d\nDerek nods to show he\u2019s listening.\n\u201cI followed him to work last night,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cand I wasn\u2019t the only one. The guy I told you about, Sullivan - he was there, too, and he\u2026 Look, I know what somebody on the hunt looks like by now, okay? And he\u2019s going to try something.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to stop it.\u201d Derek wishes that were more of a question.\nStiles\u2019 chin comes up. \u201cWith what happened with the Department\u2026\u201d He shakes his head slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody watching his back.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do I fit into this fantastic plan?\u201d\nStiles blinks, like that part was obvious. \u201cI have kind of a long history of getting in over my head when left to my own devices.\u201d\n\u201cScott turned you down?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask him.\u201d That determined set is back in his shoulders.\nDerek\u2019s beginning to see where this is going. \u201cYou don\u2019t want his help?\u201d\n\u201cScott wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt anybody, not on purpose.\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou would.\u201d\nBecause Derek\u2019s always good for something in the end. \u201cYou\u2019re calling in your favor.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sick satisfaction in knowing the world still works the way he knows it does. To his credit, Stiles looks uncomfortable. \u201cIf I have to,\u201d he says with conviction. And then he softens. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather ask a friend for help.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t mean Scott.\nHe doesn\u2019t mean Scott, and he\u2019s dead serious. People don\u2019t ask Derek. They demand or they order or they suggest, if they\u2019re feeling somehow entitled, but they don\u2019t ask. Whatever ground they\u2019re on here, it\u2019s nothing like solid.\nStiles\u2019 right hand is wrapped around the railing of the stairs hard enough to turn his knuckles white. If he were a wolf, he\u2019d be denting it. Derek should not be thinking about that.\n\u201cThis is my dad, Derek. My dad. He can\u2019t\u2026\u201d His mouth is a tight line, and his expression is helpless.\nMy, what big eyes you have, Derek remembers. Nobody\u2019s looked at him like an answer in a long time.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d he says, before he knows he\u2019s going to.\nHe grabs his jacket and heads back upstairs without letting himself analyze it too much. Stiles jogs to keep up with him, but doesn\u2019t complain.\n\u201cI\u2019m not your weapon,\u201d Derek says over the Camaro\u2019s roof, trying to regain some ground.\nStiles shakes his head, though. \u201cNo, I know. With luck, I can get Sullivan on video breaking his parole and he\u2019ll never even know we\u2019re there. I just need some backup.\u201d\nHe slides into the passenger seat and gives Derek directions, and then doesn\u2019t speak again for the next hour.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles\u2019 dad\u2019s overnight gig is apparently an art museum out in the valley. Derek parks at the closed restaurant down the street to get the lay of the land. The museum entrance is well lit and designed perfectly to make a theft difficult; the parking lot is pitch black and designed perfectly to make an ambush easier than hell.\nDerek takes one look at the place and makes an executive decision.\n\u201cStay in the car.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles genuinely blinks at him.\n\u201cWas that too complicated?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cSit. Stay.\u201d\n\u201cLook at you, with your ironic deployment of dog jokes.\u201d The humor doesn\u2019t go near his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d\nDerek growls, but Stiles refuses to be intimidated and short of leaving him in the trunk, there\u2019s not much Derek can do about it. Doesn\u2019t stop him from thinking longingly of the idea as they circle the perimeter and Stiles fails to move with any kind of stealth, but to be fair, Derek gets the impression he\u2019s trying.\nIt\u2019s really obvious, then, when Stiles freezes in place. His heart speeds up, and Derek follows his eye line to a car parked a block down the street. \u201cSullivan\u2019s?\u201d he asks, and Stiles nods.\nThey\u2019re at the back of the building, facing a set of loading docks maybe a hundred feet away. He can see the red lights of surveillance cameras from here; he can also see that the one above the folding door is out. As they get closer, it\u2019s clear the door itself has a good two-foot gap at the bottom, plenty of room for someone to roll under.\n\u201cWho\u2019d you say got your dad this job?\u201d\n\u201cAn old friend from the Depart\u2026 Shit. He\u2019s in on it,\u201d Stiles realizes.\nDerek tilts his head in agreement. He can\u2019t hear anyone waiting inside, and nothing happens when he slips under the door with Stiles behind him. He gets a whiff of gun oil heading into the main museum and follows it. Sullivan\u2019s accomplice must have taken care of the internal cameras, too, because no alarms go off.\nThey\u2019re crossing from a room full of paintings into one with aggressively modern statues when they catch up with Sullivan. He\u2019s waiting by the room\u2019s far exit with a pistol in his hand, posed like the definition of an ambush.\nDerek recognizes his own fury right about the time he crashes into Sullivan\u2019s unsuspecting back. The gun goes spinning off into the dark, and he\u2019s dimly aware of Stiles sprinting after it, but mostly he\u2019s focused on getting a good grip on the spineless asshole writhing out from under him.\nSullivan manages to get a hand free and then suddenly there\u2019s a flare of pain in Derek\u2019s ribs and he\u2019s automatically letting go. They wind up crouched face to face with a few feet between them, and the muted floor lights glint on the blade in Sullivan\u2019s hands. Derek\u2019s all but healed already, but he\u2019d rather not shift if he can avoid it and Sullivan\u2019s not going to go down without a fight.\n\u201cShit shit shit,\u201d Stiles says somewhere off to the left, and then there\u2019s a splintering crash and an alarm that could wake the dead.\nSullivan looks back and forth between Derek and the room\u2019s exit, decides it\u2019s not worth it, and takes off for the loading dock. Derek and Stiles are only a few seconds behind him, but his car is right there. There\u2019s no time to do anything even if they could catch him, not with the cops probably on their way. Derek drags Stiles to the Camaro and gets busy retreating at as sedate a pace as he can manage.\n\u201cSo I think I just destroyed something really expensive and artsy.\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes are wide. \u201cIn my defense, it was also ugly like the mutant spawn of hell.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek says, trying to listen for sirens behind them.\nThey all seem to be headed straight for the museum. At the next red light, Stiles clears his throat.\n\u201cI know where Sullivan\u2019s staying.\u201d At Derek\u2019s look, he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can find out when breaking the law is a relatively minor consideration.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSullivan\u2019s place turns out to be a trailer in the middle of nowhere. There aren\u2019t any lights on and no sign of his car, and Stiles scrambles out of the Camaro before it\u2019s fully stopped moving. He\u2019s halfway across the yard before Derek catches up with him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Derek hisses, keeping his voice low just in case.\n\u201cGetting proof that he\u2019s a parole-violating son of a bitch before he tries again. You got a better plan?\u201d\nDerek really wishes he did. This one feels like a disaster waiting to happen.\nIt\u2019s confirmed when Stiles is reaching for the door handle and Derek suddenly becomes aware that he\u2019s hearing one more heartbeat than he should. Derek holds up a hand and Stiles freezes, but Sullivan\u2019s already walking around the end of the trailer. He\u2019s got the knife out and a mean grin on his face.\n\u201cThought you might be along.\u201d He cocks his head, gesturing between them with the knife. \u201cNow this one I don\u2019t recognize, but you\u2026 You look just like your mom, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nStiles straightens, anger pouring off him in waves. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away with this.\u201d\nSullivan actually laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no proof, kiddo, not a damn thing that will stand up in court. Trust me on that.\u201d He bares his teeth like a shark. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you, too. You think anybody\u2019s going to listen to you when I do put a bullet in Daddy?\u201d\nDerek is momentarily distracted by the thought of how satisfying it would be to break this man\u2019s neck. He only sees it in his peripheral vision when Stiles moves; by the time his head is turned, the gun from the museum is out of the pocket of his hoodie and leveled at Sullivan.\nSullivan\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change, but Derek hears the trip in his heartbeat. \u201cYou going to shoot me with the safety on, kid?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 arm doesn\u2019t waver. He doesn\u2019t even glance at the gun. \u201cYeah, that always works in movies, doesn\u2019t it? Never hurts to be sure, though.\u201d He shifts just slightly and fires over Sullivan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNope, it\u2019s off.\u201d\nThat shakes Sullivan up. It\u2019s obvious that his calm is cracking, but he\u2019s still aiming for slick conviction. \u201cCome on, now. Little junior lawman like you? We both know you don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want,\u201d Stiles says in a flat voice Derek\u2019s never heard from him.\nIt sets something off in Derek\u2019s spine, a little spark of intention that has him shifting into the form that could never be mistaken for human. He stalks forward with a low rumble in his chest.\nStiles just draws himself up straighter in surprise, but Sullivan takes it badly. He gets in one good swing with the knife before Derek grabs his wrist and wrenches until it snaps, and then he flattens himself against the wall and scratches like he can claw through it. He reeks of fear and makes a strangled, high noise when Derek leans into his personal space. It\u2019s immensely rewarding.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he can see Stiles recalibrate on the fly. It\u2019s only a beat before the confidence comes back into his stance. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to do this, but you left me no choice. Meet my friend, Cujo.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s growl kicks up a notch in irritation, but it has the added benefit of making Sullivan piss himself a little. Derek would roll his eyes if it weren\u2019t completely breaking character.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles continues, \u201cCujo here, he\u2019s really protective and surprisingly resourceful. Like a big, hairy velociraptor, only better with doors.\u201d\nDerek obligingly holds one hand in front of Sullivan\u2019s face and flexes his claws.\n\u201cAnd this is the best part: Once he\u2019s got your scent, there\u2019s pretty much nowhere he can\u2019t find you. You ever see that Mythbusters where they try to get away from the bloodhound? Spoiler alert: nothing doing.\u201d There\u2019s a grin in Stiles\u2019 voice now. It\u2019s full of sharp edges, but Derek will take it. \u201cI don\u2019t actually have to spell out what happens when Cujo catches you, right?\u201d\nSullivan is barely daring to breathe. His eyes flicker from Derek\u2019s eyes to Stiles and then back to Derek\u2019s teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cSo here\u2019s how this is going to work,\u201d Stiles says, taking that for an answer. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find religion or head for Mexico or join a circus, I don\u2019t really care, but we never hear from you again. And if anything happens to my dad or me\u2026 well. No one will hear from you again. Okay?\u201d\nSullivan doesn\u2019t move. Stiles grunts. \u201cYou can let up a little there, big guy.\u201d\nAs soon as Derek takes a step back, Sullivan bolts. Derek blocks his way to Stiles, but he heads in the opposite direction. He doesn\u2019t stop running until he gets to his car somewhere far back in the woods, and then tears out with a spin of tires. If they\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll get picked up on a traffic violation.\nShow and tell over, Derek shakes off the change and works his jaw to get the kinks out. When he looks over, Stiles is staring at his feet, scrubbing one hand through his short hair. The gun is still in the other, hanging at his side.\nStiles blows out a long breath. \u201cSo. I think that went well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles spends the first half of the drive back taking the gun apart and rubbing all the pieces with the bottom of his shirt. It\u2019s obviously not a new skill, long fingers confident and comfortable with the motions. He catches Derek watching.\n\u201cCop\u2019s kid,\u201d he reminds him, and doesn\u2019t say anything else until he tells Derek to stop before the next bridge. It\u2019s late enough that there\u2019s no traffic. He crawls out of the car and over the barrier to reach the outer edge, and then drops the gun\u2019s parts into the water. He smells like the night air when he climbs back into the passenger seat, and something else underneath that makes Derek uneasy.\nHe holds off on starting the car.\n\u201cI would have done it.\u201d\nWhen Derek glances over, Stiles is staring at his hands. Palm-up and empty, they\u2019re perfectly steady.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Derek\u2019s not sure what response he\u2019s supposed to give. It\u2019s just the truth.\n\u201cI could have killed him and not even felt bad about it.\u201d The hollow note in his voice is distracting. \u201cI always knew I could do it, if I had to, but I thought\u2026 You\u2019re supposed to feel bad, right?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat does that mean? What does that make me?\u201d Stiles asks, talking more to the dashboard than to Derek, but sounding like the answer is vital.\nThe familiarity of it hits Derek hard, steals the words from him for long enough to let silence fall again. Something else occurs to Stiles then, judging by the way his head snaps upright.\n\u201cOh, Jesus. My dad can\u2019t know\u2026 Whatever else happens, I don\u2019t care, he just can\u2019t ever know, okay?\u201d He links his fingers behind his head, movements sharp and sudden. His neck bows again, and his heart takes off like a horse from the starting gate.\n\u201cStiles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d One hand rubs over his chest, and the look on his face melts into disbelief. His laugh is ragged around the edges. \u201cThis is stupid. God, this is so stupid. People keep dying in front of me and I keep almost dying and this is what I fucking can\u2019t deal with?\u201d\nDerek wants to do him the courtesy of ignoring him right now, but his heartbeat is rabbit-fast in Derek\u2019s ears and the feel of him is raking over every nerve Derek has. He\u2019s like a thunderstorm rising fast, or an earthquake coming on.\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Stiles says, curling over his knees. His breathing hits a hitching rhythm and Derek lays his hand over the frantic rise-fall of Stiles\u2019 back on pure instinct. He gets a low, choked noise in return. He runs his hand up and fits it around the bones of Stiles\u2019 neck and just holds there.\nFor long, suspended minutes nothing changes. Derek squeezes and releases and can\u2019t come up with a single other thing to do or say, and then the tension seeps out from under his palm. He works his thumb in slow circles until Stiles lets out a shuddering sigh and draws an almost normal inhale after. He should take his hand away, then; he doesn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s been long enough that the car\u2019s stopped ticking in the cooler air, and the loudest sound around them is the chirping of the river frogs from under the bridge. When Stiles\u2019 body loosens to a softer curve, Derek finally reaches for the key.\n\u201cIt makes us strong,\u201d he decides at last, miles down the road with nothing beyond the headlights. Stiles rolls against the headrest to face him. \u201cWe do what we have to, and if they\u2019re safe at the end of the day...\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens to us then?\u201d His voice is a soft vibration over the engine.\nDerek hates him slightly for asking. Hates himself more for wondering the same thing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I find out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles\u2019 father\u2019s SUV is in the driveway when they get back. There\u2019s a lamp on in the living room, too.\nStiles stares at the house for a long time. The light is gray this close to dawn, and it gives him a resigned, distant look that Derek doesn\u2019t like. Stiles reaches for the door handle without a word and Derek grabs for his arm.\n\u201cWhat are we going to tell your dad?\u201d\nHe blinks like Derek\u2019s said something unexpected, but some of the blankness melts out of him, at least. \u201cI ran out to the store, I guess. The Jeep broke down and I forgot to charge my phone. You were just driving by.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a questioning note in that last part, and Derek nods to show he\u2019ll go along. It\u2019s a decent story; he doesn\u2019t have any other explanations on hand that won\u2019t get Stiles in just as much trouble and himself possibly arrested.\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Stiles says, and gets out of the car.\nStilinski must see them coming up the driveway. He meets them on the porch, and if Derek couldn\u2019t spot the stark terror around his eyes, he might mistake it for anger.\n\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d His voice is hoarse, and Stiles flinches.\nDerek watches the mask come over him as he opens his mouth. \u201cThe milk smelled funny and we\u2019re out of cereal, so I was going to get some, but the Jeep started making this grinding sound and Derek drove by and saw me but that took, like, hours, and we had to move the Jeep so it wasn\u2019t on the road where \u2013\u201c\nStilinski holds up one hand. \u201cOkay.\u201d His heart rate\u2019s dropping back down, and weariness is settling over his shoulders. \u201cUpstairs. We\u2019ll talk about it after we\u2019ve both gotten some sleep.\u201d\nNow that the bullshitting is out of the way, Stiles deflates at the reprieve. He heads into the house with one last look back at Derek, and a grateful little nod once he\u2019s behind his dad\u2019s back.\n\u201cThought you weren\u2019t seeing each other anymore,\u201d Stilinski says when they\u2019re alone, tone neutral.\nDerek matches it. \u201cWe\u2019re not. I was just in the right place at the right time.\u201d\nHe\u2019s expecting to see relief, maybe even some kind of triumph. Instead, Stilinski just looks more tired. After a moment, he nods and offers his hand to Derek.\n\u201cThanks for getting him home.\u201d His grip is firm, but not challenging. Solid and comfortable, and it occurs to Derek that he likes this man.\nHe returns the nod, his eyes tracking to the stairs without his permission. \u201cHe\u2019s a good \u2013\u201c and he can\u2019t finish it, can\u2019t say kid, because Stiles isn\u2019t. Not like he should be. He\u2019s always refused to be what Derek expects.\nHe realizes he\u2019s been silent too long. Stilinski\u2019s just watching him, though.\n\u201cYeah, he is,\u201d he says quietly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek goes back the next night to check, but there\u2019s no sign of Sullivan at the trailer or near the museum. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s still running like hell. The rest of that night is like a sore tooth that he can\u2019t stop working at, but that much at least was fantastic.\nHe stays away from Stiles. Keeping his distance is the smart thing to do, Derek knows it, and he\u2019s on a new mission to only do the smart things. None of them can afford otherwise. When Derek cares, he makes mistakes.\nHe hadn\u2019t counted on Stiles disrupting the plan, but he\u2019s also somehow completely not shocked to find the train station once again smelling like him. Derek doesn\u2019t see him at first, but there\u2019s a flash of movement from inside the train car and Derek follows it.\nHe\u2019s barely through the folding doors, lips curling involuntarily, when he recognizes his mistake.\nThe man sitting in the train isn\u2019t Stiles. He\u2019s wearing a lacrosse jersey with Stiles\u2019 number on it; under it, though, is tight black clothing. Derek has half a second to comprehend exactly how fucked he is before something small and sharp sinks into his back and his vision tunnels.\nHe makes it one snarling step towards the hunter in front of him, but the man just smiles. \u201cNight night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s shifting forms before he\u2019s fully awake, on his feet before his eyes are open. It doesn\u2019t do him any good. The manacles around his wrists hold, and the chain leading from them to the floor pulls him up short the second he gets upright. At least his hands are in front of him.\nThe same hunter\u2019s waiting calmly a few feet out of reach. He\u2019s taken off the jersey, but the all-black motif and faint air of smug asshole haven\u2019t changed.\n\u201cMorning, sunshine.\u201d He smirks. \u201cWell, middle of the night, actually, but who\u2019s counting.\u201d\nDerek knows where he is at a glance. The old condemned rec center gym spans out around him in all directions. They must have torn up the wood flooring to bolt his restraints into the concrete, but the rest of the place looks undisturbed. He glances at the second floor balcony expecting more hunters, but there\u2019s only a clutter of old weightlifting equipment.\n\u201cWhy not just kill me?\u201d He has a hunch he knows. He\u2019s hoping he\u2019s wrong, though.\nHe\u2019s not. \u201cNow that wouldn\u2019t be very efficient, would it?\u201d The bastard tuts. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to wait right here for the rest of your pack to come charging in.\u201d He holds up Derek\u2019s phone. \u201cI love technology. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t stupid enough to have programmed anyone in under their real names, but he doubts it matters.\n\u201cWith Papa Wolf out of commission, how long do you think it\u2019ll take for us to pick them off?\u201d Derek\u2019s hands jerk unconsciously, and the hunter\u2019s smirk widens. \u201cIt\u2019s a chilly night. Maybe we\u2019ll have a nice, big bonfire right here in this old firetrap.\u201d\nDerek won\u2019t give them the satisfaction of seeing him react further. Hollow victories may be all he gets.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice symmetry to it, don\u2019t you think? Poetic,\u201d the hunter keeps going. \u201cYou could even \u2013\u201c\nAnd then there\u2019s a whistle of air and something white and round bounces off his head. His expression melts into confusion, and he drops like a stone.\nA voice comes out of the darkness to the right. \u201cMore of a limerick guy, myself.\u201d\nDerek knows that voice. Stiles jogs the rest of the way over to his side and grins wildly. \u201cLike, \u2018These hunters, they each have a gun / I wish they were so much more fun...\u2019\u201d He\u2019s got a lacrosse stick in his hand, but he drops it to reach for Derek\u2019s manacles. \u201cLame, I know. Sue me later.\u201d\n\u201cYou hit him with a ball?\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cHey, you don\u2019t schedule your heroic rescues in advance, you take what you can get.\u201d\nSomewhere outside the rear of the building, there\u2019s an explosion, and then a grating reptilian scream. Closer to the front, a scattering of gunshots is followed by Isaac\u2019s roar. He sounds more angry than hurt, at least.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019d be the cavalry. Not subtle, but effective.\u201d Stiles\u2019 fingers brush his wrist around the manacles. \u201cDamn it. They couldn\u2019t just go for handcuffs like normal people?\u201d\nThere are footsteps headed toward them. Whoever\u2019s coming, Derek doesn\u2019t recognize them and they smell like gunpowder. They\u2019re out of time.\n\u201cStiles. Go.\u201d\nStiles grits his teeth and doesn\u2019t answer. He switches from the manacles to the padlock on the chain running to the floor. It snicks open just as a blonde dressed in black walks out of the corridor, pistol first. Two others, both men, trail her out a beat later.\nHer smile is casual. \u201cIt\u2019s almost cute, really. You know what they say about a boy and his dog, Stiles.\u201d\nAbove them, Derek sees Scott start weaving through the exercise equipment. He catches the shape of a longbow out of the corner of his eye, working around the balcony to get a clear shot at the hunters.\nDerek snarls through his fangs to get their attention back on him, but Stiles doesn\u2019t play along. He raises his chin like an idiot. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been introduced.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ve heard all about you. Turns out, radio signals aren\u2019t very secure. Who knew?\u201d she asks flippantly.\nAnd suddenly it all comes together. Why this group never made a move, why they\u2019d never been seen in significant numbers\u2026 They\u2019d just had to hang back and let all the others do their dirty work for them, mapping out the opposition and waiting for their moment to strike. He should have seen this coming.\nThe realization almost distracts him from the flush of anger that washes over Stiles\u2019 face. He knows the instant Stiles opens his mouth that things are about to go sideways.\n\u201cYeah, see, here\u2019s the thing. That whole part where I exhibited some basic human decency and didn\u2019t just leave somebody to die in a fucking elevator shaft? I keep trying to tell everybody: That was not a declaration.\u201d\nAnd then he steps in front of Derek.\n\u201cThis is.\u201d\nThe hollow chill that surrounds every shitty thing in Derek\u2019s life settles in his chest. \u201cStiles.\u201d\nStiles ignores him. He stares the woman down, solid and unblinking. \u201cYou want him, you go through me.\u201d\nThe hunter cocks her head. \u201cFine.\u201d\nDistantly, Derek registers the sound of the shot, the sound of Scott\u2019s scream, the sound of an arrow released. It\u2019s drowned out by Stiles, knocked back a step into Derek and already falling as Derek twists a hand into his shirt.\nIt\u2019s instinct to drag him to the ground, to hunch over him before looking up for the next attack. The other hunters won\u2019t be far behind.\nExcept they will. They\u2019re standing frozen with their guns only half raised, and Derek tracks their line of sight up to where Allison holds steady aim. \u201cPut it down,\u201d she says, and there\u2019s steel in her voice.\nNobody moves. In the silence, the dripping of Jackson\u2019s claws somewhere in the shadows and Stiles\u2019 ragged breathing are suddenly deafening. It\u2019s gone silent outside, too, and his pack feels closer.\nOne of the hunters stares hard at Allison\u2019s face. \u201cYou think there aren\u2019t others? You think you can win this?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll give you three seconds before I drop you next to your boss.\u201d\nAnother beat, and the men ease themselves into a crouch and lay the guns down. By the time they\u2019re fading into the shadows, Derek\u2019s back to human form.\n\u201cBoyd, Jackson: follow them. Erica, pull the arrow and get rid of the body,\u201d he rattles off without looking away from Stiles. The hole in his shirt is so small that Derek\u2019s hand fits over it with room to curl over his ribs, but the ground under him is already staining dark.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this. Take my car,\u201d Allison says, suddenly beside him and handing her keys to Scott, and Derek blocks out the sound Stiles makes when he lifts him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe ride to the hospital seems impossibly long.\nPeople like to pretend that blood smells like copper. It doesn\u2019t; it smells like blood. It feels slick and warm on skin if there\u2019s enough of it flowing continuously. There\u2019s enough of it, in the back of the car.\nThe closer they come to the center of town, the more streetlights there are to see by. They paint Stiles\u2019 skin strange shades of orange, but it\u2019s better then the ashen contrast with Derek\u2019s jacket between lights. They catch in his wide, dark eyes and on his lips where he\u2019s mouthing Derek\u2019s name.\nHe\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s dying, and he\u2019s afraid, and Derek wants to break everything he can get his fingers on because he can\u2019t fix the damage under his hands right now.\n\u201cMy dad,\u201d Stiles murmurs, barely louder than the tires over the road. \u201cWatch him, okay? Please.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t have any more promises to give. He makes it anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d\nAnd Stiles relaxes, goes that little bit heavier against Derek\u2019s hold, and Derek snarls, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\nFrom the driver\u2019s seat, Scott makes a noise that no one would mistake for human, and then the car is slowing and Derek is already springing for the door handle. He turns toward the hospital and Scott\u2019s blocking his way, only the color of his eyes giving away the wolf. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there.\u201d\nDerek moves to slip around him. Scott steps in closer. \u201cIf you want them to let you anywhere near him, you need to go right now.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s the smart play, and a detached part of Derek is even proud of Scott for seeing that. It doesn\u2019t make it any easier to lay Stiles in his arms and watch him go.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe morgue is private. There\u2019s not much traffic, little chance of him getting caught, and it\u2019s quiet enough that he can focus on a specific rhythm two floors away. He cleans himself up as much as he can, finds bolt cutters in a closet for the manacles, and settles in a dark corner, closing his eyes to focus better.\nWhen he opens them again, Allison is watching him from a few feet away. He tenses automatically, but she only folds herself slowly down to sit on the floor.\n\u201cHave they said\u2026\u201d he starts, voice rough to his own ears, but she shakes her head.\n\u201cNo word yet.\u201d\nHe nods, and watches her take a slow look around them. She frowns. \u201cYou get that this is creepy, right?\u201d\nHe avoids that one. \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\n\u201cErica. She said it\u2019s your favorite place to make friends.\u201d The frown gets deeper.\n\u201cInside joke,\u201d Derek says, even though it isn\u2019t. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nWhen she straightens like that, raises her chin just right, he can see the fighter in her. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a better time.\u201d\nShe\u2019s probably not wrong. He nods.\n\u201cWe\u2019re both going to have enemies after this,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be each other.\u201d\nOf all the people he would have expected that from, he hadn\u2019t seen it coming from her. It\u2019s no secret how little she likes him. \u201cYou want an alliance.\u201d\n\u201cBefore\u2026 before Kate,\u201d and he can respect the way she rides through the pain, \u201cthings were okay. Your family lived here, and we left you alone. Nobody got hurt.\u201d\n\u201cYou think we can go back to that?\u201d He doesn\u2019t bother to cover the bitterness.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should. We can do better.\u201d\nDespite himself, he wonders where this is going. He keeps his mouth shut.\n\u201cMy family\u2019s been trying to save the world for a really long time. We\u2019re an army against the darkness out there. We go where we need to and we do what\u2019s right, when we follow the code.\u201d She looks him straight in the eyes. \u201cBut you want to know what I think?\n\u201cI think I don\u2019t care. I think if everybody else wants to tear each other apart, they can go for it. I\u2019m eighteen and I\u2019m in love and I want to wake up tomorrow and not wonder if anyone I care about is going to die. I think you can understand that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not eighteen,\u201d he says. He hasn\u2019t been that young or that innocent for a long time.\nShe smiles faintly. \u201cThat\u2019s not the part I meant.\u201d\nHe swallows, not thinking about a room two floors away. \u201cAnd you think you can stop it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her smile tightens. \u201cBut I think we can. Your pack, Scott, the hunters who\u2019ll follow me\u2026 Jackson, Lydia, Danny. Stiles. We make a decent team.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a nice fantasy. \u201cLet me guess who\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She doesn\u2019t flinch, and her voice doesn\u2019t rise. \u201cWhy did you give them all the bite, Derek? The truth.\u201d\n\u201cPower,\u201d he says easily, and lets his eyes flash.\nShe just stares him down, though, waiting.\nGo to hell is on the tip of his tongue, but somehow stays there. \u201cSurvival,\u201d he grits out, finally.\nShe nods like she already knew. \u201cSo pick the one that means more to you,\u201d she says, and stands up.\nIt hits him, sudden and painful, that it\u2019s not Kate that he sees in her. It\u2019s Laura.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says, and deliberately holds out her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s find you something else to wear.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey pass deputies at various points in the halls. The cover story is apparently that Scott and Stiles were in the woods and happened to be very unlucky; in the grandest possible sense, it\u2019s even true.\nTheir worry makes it easy to feel Boyd somewhere close, Erica and Isaac farther away. Neither of them are fond of hospitals.\nJackson and Lydia are holding hands from adjoined chairs in the waiting room. Whatever they are or aren\u2019t to each other at any given moment, apparently they\u2019re still this. Jackson meets Derek\u2019s eyes and nods. Whether that means the other hunters are gone or dead, Derek doesn\u2019t actually care right now.\nHe\u2019s not prepared for Stiles\u2019 dad to be sitting next to Scott. When he raises his head, his eyes are raw and frightened, and he\u2019s making no effort to hide anything.\n\u201cSir,\u201d Derek says, for lack of anything better. He wishes, suddenly, that he were wearing his own clothes.\nStilinski clears his throat roughly and nods. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strange comfort, being allowed to share this.\nAn hour passes before he has to move again. The vending machines are visible down the hall, and they make as good an excuse as any. He doesn\u2019t comment when Scott stands and follows him.\nThey\u2019re contemplating the relative merits of candy neither of them will probably eat when the rhythm he\u2019s been following for hours now slows, stutters, and Derek holds very still until it picks back up. Beside him, there\u2019s the sound of a long breath, and when he looks Scott is watching him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s still here?\u201d Scott asks softly.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hear him?\u201d\nScott shakes his head. \u201cAllison\u2019s the only one I can pick out of a crowd.\u201d\nMost heartbeats sound alike from a distance. Stiles\u2019 doesn\u2019t, although Derek can\u2019t explain why. He realizes he\u2019s been silent too long when he feels Scott\u2019s eyes drilling into him. Derek knows what\u2019s coming before he opens his mouth.\n\u201cGive him the bite,\u201d Scott says quietly.\nDerek doesn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Scott growls, still keeping his voice low. \u201cBullshit, Derek. You can, and you will, because you are not letting this happen, you can\u2019t\u2026 You can\u2019t\u2026. I know he matters to you, you can fake it all you want but I know, and he did this for you. He\u2019s dying for you, don\u2019t you \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt won\u2019t help!\u201d He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s shouting until the silence settles in after. Down the hall, Stilinski and Mrs. McCall freeze and turn toward him. He focuses on the floor until they go back to talking, and he\u2019s quieter when he tries again. \u201cHow long was it before you started healing the first time?\u201d\nThe understanding rolls through slowly, dragging the fight out of Scott\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt won\u2019t be fast enough, will it?\u201d\nDerek shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing more to say. He buys a cup of coffee and goes back to listening for that specific cadence. Scott follows him back after a while, and this time his posture isn\u2019t warning Derek away.\nThe cup\u2019s long gone cold in his hands by the time a doctor comes out to pull Stiles\u2019 dad aside. The doctor\u2019s too seasoned to give anything away in her own body language, but the wave of relief coming off of Stilinski would be heavy enough to take Derek out at the knees if he were standing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles sleeps for the first two days. He\u2019s high as a kite for the next three, and then they start to wean him down from the good drugs. He\u2019s hurting, but more exhausted than anything; once the effects of blood loss and shock fade, he\u2019ll still have a course of physical therapy to get through. They\u2019re optimistic he\u2019ll be okay in the long run, though.\nDerek knows most of this second-hand. At first, it\u2019s just more practical to come by at night. Stiles\u2019 father is there during the day, and the others drop by in the evenings after school. It makes sense for Derek to take the night shift, slipping in unnoticed between nurse\u2019s rounds.\nIt\u2019s on the sixth night that he gets caught. Stiles shifts in his sleep and whines softly behind his teeth when the pain hits, and Derek goes still in the shadows at the corner of the room.\u00a0\nHe thinks he\u2019s in the clear until Stiles grins.\n\u201cChair\u2019s over by the window,\u201d he says, voice rough with sleep. He doesn\u2019t bother to open his eyes, and he\u2019s out again within a few breaths. There\u2019s no question he knows who\u2019s there with him; Derek can tell just by his tone.\nIt leaves him unsettled, although it\u2019s hours yet before he can put his finger on why.\nHe needs a way to keep Stiles as far from all of this as it\u2019s possible to be in Beacon Hills. Stiles will never do it by choice \u2013 not when everyone he knows is in the firing line \u2013 so Derek can\u2019t give him one. The solution, when it comes to him, is ridiculously simple. It\u2019s even got the added benefit of fulfilling the letter of a promise made.\nStiles won\u2019t forgive him for this. Derek\u2019s paid worse prices for less.\nHe waits until Stiles is scheduled to be released. Stiles\u2019 dad comes back from the hospital pharmacy, and Derek stops him in the empty corridor a few turns down from Stiles\u2019 room. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\nStilinski nods, stepping around him. \u201cJust let me get him settled in at home.\u201d\nHe keeps walking, eyes on the prescriptions in his hand. Underneath the atmospheric disinfectant, Derek can smell the gun oil on him. He\u2019s been armed since Stiles was shot.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Sullivan.\u201d\nStilinski freezes. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asks without turning around.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Sullivan. He had nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you know that, exactly?\u201d Now he does turn, and the air is the shade of still before a bomb goes off.\n\u201cBecause I know that he\u2019s not a threat anymore.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t blink. \u201cAnd because I was there.\u201d\nStilinski\u2019s face hardens. He doesn\u2019t need to ask where.\n\u201cYour son has a habit of picking fights that aren\u2019t his,\u201d Derek says. It\u2019s a struggle, not to look away from the man\u2019s expression. \u201cIf it means anything, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted him anywhere near this one.\u201d\n\u201cThe person who shot Stiles was after you.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I exist,\u201d he says, and it means something that it comes out more resigned than bitter. Maybe just that he\u2019s tired of being angry.\n\u201cThis person\u2026 Where would I find them?\u201d\nDerek gives a shake of his head. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Stilinski doesn\u2019t look like his law-abiding tendencies are going to kick in. Derek keeps going. \u201cThere are others who could still be a problem, though.\u201d\n\u201cOthers. Jesus.\u201d His jaw clenches tighter, and the paper bags in his hand rustle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me everything.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time someone did,\u201d Derek agrees. \u201cI said I\u2019d protect you; I didn\u2019t say how.\u201d\n\u201cProtect me.\u201d Stilinski looks almost amused. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, son, but \u2013\u201c\nDerek lets the change come over his face, eyes and teeth and all. Stilinski doesn\u2019t flinch away or reach for his gun, just stops breathing and stares for a long time. His heartbeat kicks into a new range, though, and the color drains from his face.\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d\nDerek shifts back. \u201cThat\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe keeps his guard up \u2013 no one goes out alone, everyone checks in at least once a day, no one gets directly connected with him if they can help it \u2013 but there\u2019s every indication the hunters are actually gone this time. With Allison\u2019s last name in play again, there\u2019s a chance any others will hesitate to make a move. It might be politics that saves them in the end after all.\nHe\u2019s too cautious to say it aloud, but he thinks they might have weathered this particular disaster.\nThat\u2019s why it comes as such a shock to feel Erica\u2019s agony loud and clear from halfway across town in the middle of an otherwise uneventful Saturday afternoon. She doesn\u2019t answer her phone, and he doesn\u2019t waste time calling the others.\nWhen the feeling leads him to the trees behind Stiles\u2019 house, his racing heart stutters. It\u2019s sheer confusion, though, that stops him in his tracks at the back yard. Erica is definitely there, and she\u2019s not alone. Lydia\u2019s next to her, both of them relaxed and apparently swapping tips for their next Bio exam.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d His voice can\u2019t seem to choose between alarmed or bewildered.\nLydia smiles at him sunnily. \u201cOh, good. You\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek agrees slowly. That much he\u2019s sure of.\n\u201cConveniently, so is Stiles,\u201d Lydia says.\n\u201cFirst window after the garage. You know the way,\u201d Erica continues.\nThey move away from him in synch, light with the confidence of a job well done. Derek decides that irritation is definitely the emotion to go with. \u201cThe idea is to stay away from him.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we know,\u201d Lydia says, and underneath the brightness is a layer of pure fury. \u201cHe\u2019s not up to tracking you down yet, and we\u2019re all sick of watching him be miserable. You clearly weren\u2019t ever going to get over yourself, so we fixed it.\u201d\nHe\u2019s expecting Erica to have the decency to be sheepish, but her arms cross defiantly over her chest. She\u2019s not giving ground, either. The absolute lack of a sudden appearance by the rest of his pack clues him in to how premeditated this must have been.\n\u201cHow did you fake the pain?\u201d he asks at last, grudgingly impressed. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that was possible.\nLydia looks at him like he\u2019s too stupid to live. \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI stabbed her with a barbeque fork until you got close.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t help staring at Erica. \u201cIt\u2019s for a good cause,\u201d she assures him.\nThe slow, terrifying realization comes over him then: They\u2019ve bonded.\nHe sighs and crosses his own arms. \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re bullshit,\u201d Lydia says, nodding. \u201cBut at least go tell him what they are. You can sort it out with him now or wait until he goes looking for you, but if he tears his stitches you\u2019ll only feel like more of an idiot.\u201d\nHe remembers a time when they were all afraid of him. Well, when some of them were afraid of him. He tries to tell himself he feels nostalgic for it as he swings up onto the roof, but even he\u2019s not buying it. Besides, giving Stiles whatever closure he\u2019s looking for here isn\u2019t a terrible idea.\nStiles\u2019 window is open. He\u2019s sitting at his desk with his back to Derek, mountains of paper and books covering all available surface area. His hair is a little longer than Derek\u2019s ever seen it, his shoulders are set in a tired line, and the white strap of a sling stands out against the arch of his neck. Derek stops at the windowsill, cataloguing it all.\n\u201cTelling my dad was a dick move,\u201d Stiles says without raising his head.\nDespite himself, Derek\u2019s lips quirk up at being caught. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he needed to know?\u201d It\u2019s the truth, even if it\u2019s not all of it.\nStiles is silent for a minute. \u201cI thought he could fix it, you know, back at the beginning? But then...\u201d He shrugs with just the good shoulder, and winces anyway. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him try to protect me, not with what was at stake.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s at stake is exactly the problem, Derek thinks. Stiles finally meets his eyes, though, and it\u2019s like he heard anyway.\n\u201cI get what you were trying to do. It\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he says levelly. \u201cI keep trying to tell you, Derek, your plans usually suck.\u201d\nThe smile teasing at the corners of Stiles\u2019 lips is frustrating. Derek can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when he lost control of this conversation, but it\u2019s slipping through his fingers nonetheless. \u201cHe won\u2019t let you be involved with this.\u201d\nThe smile doesn\u2019t fade. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, too. Turns out, though, that he still knows me better than either of us thought.\u201d There\u2019s a note in there, a little rueful, a little awed. \u201cHe gets that I can\u2019t leave this alone. Doesn\u2019t like it, but he gets it. He was a cop for a long time, remember? And we both think I\u2019m safer with backup.\u201d\nHe\u2019d been so sure that he could count on Stilinski to be stronger than Derek in this. \u201cYou\u2019ll get killed.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pull the punch, lets it be stark and honest. \u201cYou want to leave him alone like that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, just as honest. \u201cAlone is the last thing I want anyone to be.\u201d\nAnd just like that, Derek knows he\u2019s going to lose this fight. He can taste it in the panic on the back of his tongue, but he\u2019s never been able to just lie down.\n\u201cMaybe I just wanted you out of the way.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a little late to pretend not to give a damn,\u201d Stiles returns gently, and Derek closes his eyes and goes under.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to do this,\u201d he says eventually.\nThis thing where you get under my skin and then shatter like glass, he means. This thing where you itch and sting and I still can\u2019t find all the pieces to get you out.\nStiles laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my lifeplan to get shot again in the near future. For one thing, Dad\u2019s insurance is going to get suspicious eventually.\u201d He turns woeful eyes on his desk. \u201cFor another, the homework buildup is ridiculous.\u201d\nHe goes back to sorting through the stacks on his desk, apparently content to let Derek have his silent breakdown. Derek leans back against the window frame and tries to decide which direction is up. With his guard lowered, it\u2019s easy to spot the circles under Stiles eyes, the lines of pain that haven\u2019t faded from around his mouth yet. He makes a frustrated noise and shifts the sling\u2019s strap an inch higher, rubbing at the skin exposed.\nOf all things, it\u2019s that sound that finally gets to Derek. He swings the rest of the way into the room and hovers with no real intention other than to be less far away, to be inside instead of out. Closing the space between them unlocks his ribcage a fraction. His finger reaching for the line of bruised skin on Stiles\u2019 neck eases it a little further, but it\u2019s still not enough until he\u2019s bending down to fit his closed mouth to the same place.\nStiles smells like blood just under the surface, and still like soap and sweat and cut grass.\nIt\u2019s terrifying, not hiding this weakness. Derek noses along the arch of his spine and over the hollow where it dives into his skull and is careful not to touch him anywhere else. He keeps his intrusion contained to just this necessity.\nStiles sighs quietly. \u201cYou have the worst timing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not at all what Derek was expecting to hear. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he says against skin, the only thought that comes to mind.\n\u201cLast time, you tried to Pretty Woman us out of being friends,\u201d Stiles corrects him, still gentle.\n\u201cIt was safer.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Stiles says, and tips his head back onto Derek\u2019s shoulder like it\u2019s a bone-deep relief. The weight of him is solid, perfectly settled into the curve of Derek\u2019s collarbone. Derek\u2019s arms curl around him of their own accord, carefully and with the chair still between them.\nA minute later, Stiles hums tiredly, and Derek realizes he\u2019s falling asleep right there. He\u2019s pliant when Derek pulls him to his feet and over to sit on the bed, but easing the sling off brings him back around. He jolts fully alert when Derek sinks to a crouch between his knees.\n\u201cYou had to pick the only time since puberty when I could not be less interested in sex?\u201d His eyes are wide and tragic.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d and Derek can\u2019t keep the grin out of his voice, feels it in the lines around his eyes, too. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d His breath moves Derek\u2019s hair when he talks, their heads bowed close together, and there\u2019s a flash of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to it all. Derek\u2019s fingers are dragging one sock over a boney ankle when he places exactly why this is familiar. The last time they\u2019d been like this, Stiles had smelled like exhaustion and pain and want, too.\nStiles\u2019 good hand comes up to lie cautiously against the back of Derek\u2019s head, though, and abruptly it\u2019s not the same at all. Under all the rest, Stiles smells like the powder softness of contentment, too weary for happiness but open to the possibility. Derek presses his nose to Stiles\u2019 wrist and breathes that in, and long fingers weave through his hair in reward.\nStiles\u2019 palm slips along Derek\u2019s face and tilts his chin up, eyes searching, and then he leans in until his lips are just shy of Derek\u2019s. \u201cCan I?\u201d he whispers.\nIt\u2019s the fact that he asks, that he means it, that catches the yes in Derek\u2019s dry throat. It must be all over his face, though, because Stiles\u2019 eyes crinkle into a grin and he closes the gap.\nDerek has never kissed anyone like this. It\u2019s careful, warm lips moving against his like an exploration of new ground, slightly chapped and real as they find a new angle, try a new pressure. Derek keeps his eyes open, and the reaction when he brushes his tongue against Stiles\u2019 bottom lip is fascinating. Neither of them breathes until Stiles suddenly remembers to, a shaky exhale rushing over Derek\u2019s mouth.\nHe feels it when Stiles leans that little bit too far and reminds himself that he hurts. Derek pulls back enough to rest their foreheads together, and Stiles beams at him. \u201cWe are going to be amazing,\u201d he breathes.\nDerek huffs a laugh and goes back to getting the other sock off. When he\u2019s done, Stiles lies down without protest, curling over on his good side toward the center of the bed, and Derek feels every ounce of his gaze as he crosses to the other side and toes off his own shoes. He stretches out facing the center, too, and there\u2019s a moment where neither of them breaks the silence.\nTrue to form, Stiles finds his words first. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some fucked up gratitude thing, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He leaves out the part where he is both fucked up and grateful. It\u2019s irrelevant.\nStiles groans softly. \u201cGood enough for me. Crash time now.\u201d His eyes are already closing, the words slurring into a yawn. \u201cGuessing that was your game plan, brief diversion into foot fetish territory aside.\u201d\nHe makes one last nudge across the bed that ends with his head tucked under Derek\u2019s chin. Everything about the move is confident of its welcome, but his heart gives him away. Derek strokes a thumb over his hip in answer, and Stiles relaxes into the real heaviness of sleep like a light switched off.\nIt\u2019s still early evening. Derek\u2019s not at all tired, but he has no intention of moving. The sun is lazy on its way down, and the bed is comfortable.\nThey\u2019re not safe. He\u2019s not sure that he believes in safety anymore. At worst, Allison\u2019s plan will fail horribly and leave them all scattered in the wreckage. In this one specific moment, though, he\u2019d rather think that it won\u2019t.\nDownstairs, the sounds of running water and the gas stove ticking to life tell him that Stiles\u2019 dad is starting dinner. In a little while, Derek will wake him and they\u2019ll head down. Derek may have to explain his presence; then again, he may not.\nFor now, he presses his cheek against the top of Stiles\u2019 head and lets himself enjoy this.\nWe are going to be amazing, he tries out, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a lie."
