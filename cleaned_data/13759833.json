Somewhere in my mind the ideas got crossed, then escalated because Sakura should have been treated better in the series. Heck. All the female characters should have been treated better.

    "text": "\nInto the Water\n\nSakura had always loved the water.\nAs a child, she had been fascinated with the way the Nara river sparkled in the midday sun, how the bubbles broke as it splashed against the rocks. She\u2019d play in the river\u2019s edge, jumping up and down and watching the droplets land on the rocks of the shore. Other times, she\u2019d block a stream with rocks or twigs or mud, waiting until the water either broke through or found another way around. She couldn\u2019t stop it. Not for long.\nHer mother came to dislike the rain, because without fail Sakura would play in the puddles and step in the mud until her little dresses were brown and dirty and completely ruined.\nLearning was a distant second-love. The smell of old texts, thoughts and ideas of those she would never get to meet was entrancing. The library was one of her favourite places to hide and read away the day.\nBut she always came back to the water\u2019s edge.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the distraction of the library failed to keep her attention, her parents would find her at the nearest brook, shoes off and giggling. If they weren\u2019t quick enough, she\u2019d jump in and be nearly impossible to pull out.\n\u201dIt\u2019s like father all over again.\u201d Kaoru-oba-san would sigh, bones creaking and grey hair that still had streaks of the dark brown of her youth. \u201cThe rare times we ever saw him, of course. He\u2019d always disappear off to the river near the house. I don\u2019t know how mother put up with him.\u201d\n\u201dYes, mother, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mebuki replied, before turning back to her daughter. \u201cOh- Sakura! Not in your new dress!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t get better when she got to the academy like her parents had hoped.\nShe was picked on for her forehead and the books she\u2019d carry with her to class. Some times she would bring scrolls, the kind that she needed both hands to carry, from the family collection. They had been left by her great-grandfather, half complete with thoughts that trailed off before starting a new train that seemed to go in a different direction before looping back to the original thought. She struggled with the words some times, but it was always a challenge and not a barrier - oh. Now that was an interesting idea for a political system. Similar to how Konoha operated even.\nAnd when the bullying reached a level she couldn\u2019t tolerate, Sakura would run to the small lake near the Academy and swim to the other side. Her teachers would shout at her, but she couldn\u2019t have been bothered to come back until after the break had finished.\nIn the water, she was uncatchable.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201dSometimes an elemental affinity will run deep in a shinobi, to depths not even they are aware of.\u201d Sarutobi offered as an explanation to Iruka when the chunin instructor expressed his frustrations. He hid his amusement at the Chunin's predicament with a long draw on his pipe, exhaling the smoke in a stream.\n\u201dI just wish she wouldn\u2019t spend all her time alone in the lake. Sakura needs to spend time with her peers.\u201d Iruka grumbled, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t catch her when she\u2019s in there either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUchiha Sasuke became her third love in life, distant compared to her first, or even her second at times. Sakura liked him not because he was pretty, which was why Ino liked him, or because he came from a clan, which was why the other girls liked him, but because he was smart.\nTrying to get his attention took almost all of hers. She didn\u2019t have time to read the old scrolls gathering dust in a corner of her bedroom, so she put them away somewhere safe. Ino-chan had explained that spending all her time in the lake made her weird, and her bullies never dared pick on her with Ino around, so she stopped her daily swims, but never managed to pull completely away from the water\u2019s edge at lunch time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe aced her studies, and did well enough with the combat component that she was one of the top kunoichi. Sasuke-kun still never seemed to look at her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe ended up on Team 7 with Sasuke-kun and Naruto, the class idiot. After her first day with Kakashi-sensei and the boys, Sakura was left disheartened with her team. It didn't really improve much from there.\nShe did, however, take heart in the training grounds Team 7 claimed as their own. There was a river close by, and no matter where her training took her on the ground, the water was a constant and reassuring presence in the back of her mind. Sakura always knew where the river ran, if it was swollen with rain water or shrunken with a summer drought, and it kept her grounded in a sea of disappointment. When they performed their daily ritual of waiting for Kakashi-sensei, Sakura would lean on the bridge, watching the water flow underneath and fighting the urge to jump in.\nHer first love was hers though, and she never shared its secrets with her team.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe mission to Wave happened.\nSakura learned that her first love, her friend, could also be an ally in battle. This changed many things in how she thought of the water, and nothing at all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBetween Naruto\u2019s sheer, raw potential, and Sasuke\u2019s newly awaken dojutsu, Kakashi seemed to forget about her. She was given simple exercises, and tried not to think of the favouritism, or her fear from almost dying because she wasn\u2019t strong enough in Wave.\nShe was weak. And it almost got her team killed.\nIt took some digging, and the dust clouds made her cough and sneeze when she pulled the old scrolls out that she had half-forgotten about, and a closer inspection revealed some to be water jutsu. They were mostly theory, about how to train with water, understand its flow and balance, and the familiar hand-writing was its own comfort to a girl who had gotten lost on the path to becoming a Kunoichi.\nPulling out a blank scroll, inspired by someone who came before, she started making her own notes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer chakra control was perfect.\nHer chakra reserves dismal.\nShe almost gave up on her dream of wielding water the way Sasuke-kun used fire, or Naruto used kage-bushin. Especially when, after she asked to learn more about water jutsu, Kakashi just patted her on the head like she was one of his nin-dogs and told her as gently as he could that she did not have the same kind of chakra reserves as the boys. Almost.\nIt turned out that the water loved Sakura as much as she loved it. With the barest amount of chakra she could call on it, feel its presence no matter how deep a river ran underground. It took some experimentation, but she could, with focus and more chakra than she felt comfortable parting with for a single use, create water.\nHer daily swims resumed. She ignored the way her teammates tried to call her out of the river each day as they waited for Kakashi, and dove deeper underwater to feel the current better. Maybe Naruto and Sasuke were stronger than her, that was fine. She\u2019d just have to be uncatchable in her own way.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey weren\u2019t ready for the chunin exams.\nKakashi entered them anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Sandaime Hokage was dead. Sasuke was gone. Naruto and the team that went with him were still in the hospital.\nSakura heard all of this, and ran to her first love, a true love, that welcomed her no matter her faults. The water embraced her as it always did.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTsunade of the Sannin became her teacher, after the writer of the scrolls, and after water.\nNaruto was gone now too. Sakura learnt to set bones, pump blood (so much like water, but not) and close wounds with her shishou during the day. She also learned how to break bones, which arteries to slice to cause an enemy to bleed out faster and how to deliver killing blows. Despite this, Tsunade made it clear that, as a medic, Sakura would not be on the front lines.\nThat knowledge chaffed at her; she needed to be able to keep up with her boys, to watch Naruto's back because he was always running in without thinking and bring the Uchiha home because Sasuke was an idiot. In the evenings she trained with scrolls written by a man she\u2019s never met but knew all the same.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201dOkay, kid.\u201d Tsunade interrupted her once when she was suppose to be taking a break but had instead turned her attention to the lightning jutsu in the scrolls. A year ago, she didn't have the chakra reserves to consider using it. She probably wouldn't ever be able to use it effectively in combat, but it could have uses elsewhere- like being re-purposed into starting a heart. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not one of the medical scrolls I gave you to study.\u201d Her Shishou snatched the scroll from Sakura\u2019s hand before she could respond, \u201cWhat on earth are you looking\u2026\u201d\n\u201dShishou?\u201d Sakura asked in the sudden silence, fingers twitching because the author was just getting to the crux of the problem of combining water and lightning jutsu. It wouldn\u2019t do to fry herself practicing.\nTsunade was quiet for a long time. \u201cWhere did you get this, Sakura?\u201d\n\u201dIt belonged to my great-grandfather.\u201d She frowned, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to learn some of the techniques. After I finish studying what you\u2019ve given me, shishou. Why?\u201d\n\u201dYour great-grandfather, huh?\u201d Tsunade moved slowly, gently rolling up the scroll as if it was as much as treasure for her as it was for Sakura, and handed it back.\n\u201dYou\u2019ve been learning some interesting jutsu,\u201d Tsunade said lightly, \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTsunade stared through the neat little hole a well-placed water bullet had carved through a boulder to the sunlight on the other side. It had taken Sakura a bit of fidgeting with the jutsu make the water bullets something to be feared. She had wanted something requiring finesse to use and her perfect chakra control allowed for the bullets to be compressed to the point they would shear through just about anything.\nHer shishou placed her hands on her hips and then turned to her apprentice lounging in the water, happy as a clam, like she hadn\u2019t just turned the lake into her own personal playground of death minutes before. \u201cYour great-grandfather must have been quite the shinobi.\u201d\nSakura, happy and content because the waters were an old friend and now an ally, blinked slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201dDo you know who he was?\u201d Tsunade continued, her gaze now on the cliffside Sakura had split in half with a blade of water.\n\u201dNo.\u201d Sakura allowed herself to float on the surface, staring at the sky overhead and enjoying the heat of a Konoha summer sun on her face, but the cool of the lake in her hair. \u201cKa-san said that he and my great-grandmother had a bit of a difficult relationship, mostly because he was never home.\u201d She frowned, trying to remember a half-forgotten memory. \u201cI think grandmother may have been a surprise.\u201d\nTsunade was quiet for a long moment. \u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t fall behind in my training, or skip a shift at the hospital, I don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t continue with this project of yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSakura trained until she collapsed. Until her hands shook and her vision blurred. She stayed up late reading scrolls, and woke up early for hospital shifts. Under Tsunade\u2019s careful guidance, Sakura learned to conquer wounds and, sometimes, beat back death. Other times, she learned how to inflict it.\nOccasionally, her shishou would ask questions about her family. Some she could answer. Most she couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNaruto returned, still bright and blinding and- huh. Sakura found her fourth love in the foxy smile of a brother she didn\u2019t know she had.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSakura hated the desert with a burning passion. No matter how she stretched her senses across the sands, water eluded her. It left her grumpy and irritated. The wind though...\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGaara was dead. Then he wasn\u2019t.\nBetween those moments, Sakura had to make a calculation, cold and considerate, before she crushed Sasori\u2019s heart with her bare hand. There was no water in the desert to wipe off the blood and muscle- she left the stain like it was a badge of honour.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was weak once.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201dAre you absolutely sure?\u201d Tsunade tapped a finger against the kitchen table of her apprentice\u2019s home. The rescue mission would be wrapping up soon, and the sannin did not care to explain why she was in Sakura\u2019s home when Sakura returned. Finding a time to approach the family without her apprentice around had turned into a logistical nightmare.\n\u201dQuite, Hokage-sama.\u201d Mebuki replied. \u201cBefore my mother passed, she mentioned how much she would like to return to her childhood home on the border of Fire Country. We didn\u2019t get a chance, of course. She went downhill very quickly.\u201d The chunin sighed, \u201cShe had always wanted to see her father again, or at least know why he never came home. I\u2019m afraid we never found out. After I was born, and my grandmother passed, my mother moved the both of us to Konoha.\u201d\n\u201dAnd your grandfather, he had white hair?\u201d\nMebuki shrugged, \u201cAs far as I know. I never had a chance to meet the man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLightning was interesting, sharp and painful when handled with anything less than respect.\nWind was finicky. Hard to grasp and harder still to hold. But she had always been stubborn.\nEarth was steady, grounding and powerful. Always ready for her call.\nWater though was forever and always her first lover, a friend, and an ally. As long as she had water, Sakura was complete.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey tangled with Sasuke.\nThe outcome left Sakura with a bitter taste in her mouth. He was just so fast. She didn\u2019t even have time to call on the water jutsu she had been trying so hard to learn and master. They trudge home in a thunderstorm they couldn\u2019t manage to shake. Sakura was the only one accepting of the drenched rat look.\nShe spent an entire day at the lake, watching the water sparkle in the sunlight. She built a little dam out of twigs and mud in a stream of water, just to watch the water carve its way though. The stream didn\u2019t break through.\nInstead, it found another path around the barrier.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTsunade concluded the medical component of her apprenticeship, leaving Sakura free to address the fact she was just not fast enough to catch Sasuke. Digging through scrolls, she found one she hadn\u2019t open before, in the pile of complex jutsu or jutsu she simply didn\u2019t have the chakra reserves for.\nShe had misplaced this one, she concluded later, or her younger self had mistakenly assumed she wouldn\u2019t be able to pull off this jutsu. Parts of it were missing and the theory was very advanced, enough that it almost made her head spin, but Sakura learned how to take a human body apart and put it back together in little over two years. Advanced was relative.\nThis jutsu was all about control, not chakra, about seals and time and space and the ways between them. It struck her as familiar, but she couldn\u2019t quite place why.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer interest was perked when Tsunade absently mentioned that there was no medical jutsu for testing an individual nerve without triggering the rest in an area. Sakura turned that thought over and over in her head, before pulling out a blank scroll and calculating how much chakra would be needed to shock a single nerve and hand seals to do it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt could be safely said that Uchiha Sasuke did not see Haruno Sakura coming.\nNeither did the rest of Team Kakashi.\nShe had lost her temper and summoned enough water from nowhere to make a lake, one that everytime Sasuke\u2019s foot touched the surface, water tried to skewer him. His look of complete and utter shock was a victory that would comfort Sakura for the rest of her life.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough, in the end. The Uchiha had taken the first opportunity he could to retreat in the face of Team Kakashi\u2019s attacks.\nNo matter how much Naruto badgered her about how cool that was and asking where she learned it, or the weight of Kakashi\u2019s lone eye on her, Sakura kept silent. She didn\u2019t say a word the whole way home, too busy thinking about how she could trap that Uchiha, or maybe drown him, or at least be able to catch him. She needed to work on that time/space jutsu more diligently.\nHer team left her. They shouldn\u2019t be surprised that she grew strong without them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKakashi tried cornering her when they made it back to Konoha. He tried to be the sensei she needed when she was a genin and offered to teach her the water jutsu she had asked him about all those years ago.\nShe laughed at him and walked away. Kakashi had had his chance, back when she was nothing, and he had chosen the boys. Sakura had to learn without his guidance. She had learn to outgrow him.\nThe water was her teacher now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlack flames covered the land.\nItachi was probably dead considering that Sasuke wasn\u2019t there. It grated in a different way, and Sakura felt her anger bubble to the surface. Sasuke had gotten away again.\nShe felt the presence of a rainstorm on the horizon, and fueled by her anger, a better part of her chakra, and a few hand seals, she called the monsoon close. Rain fell, so thick that she couldn\u2019t see anything directly around her and it was practically like being in a lake.\nThe water comforted her, cleared her mind, and her anger ebbed away with the tide. An instinct she had learned to associate with the water told her there was something in the rain.\nHer team stared at her back as she disappeared into the rainfall, not quite understanding what they had just seen, only to return with a slightly charred lump, the black flames having never stood a chance in the face of Sakura\u2019s fury.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSakura stared.\nUchiha Itachi, mass-murderer, S-class missing-nin and all around dangerous shinobi, stared back. \u201cYou extinguished them.\u201d He repeated, brows slightly furrowed in confusion. Sakura got the impression that surprising him didn\u2019t happen all that often.\nShe nodded slowly, double-checking his chest cavity for any remaining infection. He was bound under what might have been Kakashi\u2019s entire selection of chakra-suppression seals and all his limbs tied with wire, rope, and even more seals. Sakura concluded he was probably still dangerous. \u201cThe black flames? Yes.\u201d\nThe Uchiha was still staring at her, as if he could divine her entire existance if only he stared hard enough. \u201cThat was Amaterasu.\u201d\n\u201dSure.\u201d Sakura agreed. His chest would recover, but all the rushed and botched healings left scars on his lungs and spoke to someone attempting something they had seen but didn\u2019t understand. Stupid Sharingan.\nBlack eyebrows furrowed, slim and pretty and how in the universe was it fair that Uchihas were blessed with such pretty genetics? Hmm. Genetics. Could she make a jutsu that could reveal the presence of kekkei genkai, dormant or active? After a couple of dead fish, she managed to get the her new, more reliable, heart-restarting jutsu to work and she did need another research topic...\n\u201dThe black flames,\u201d The Uchiha continued as if he wasn\u2019t being prepared for transport back to the village for trial, \u201cburn for three days and cannot\u2026 it should not be possible to extinguish them.\u201d\nSakura snorted, because as close as the Uchiha are to fire, she was far closer to water. \u201cWell,\u201d she began as politely as she was able to, \u201cThankfully you didn\u2019t tell me that beforehand.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe felt the Uchiha\u2019s eyes on her the entire trip back to Konoha.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou should learn kenjutsu.\u201d Kakashi told her after the seventh time he tracked her down in as many days. Sakura was not quite sure how he always managed to find her, but it served to reinforce the idea that he had definitely been avoiding her while Naruto was gone.\nShe barely held back her snort, turning it into a cough instead. \u201cOh? Even if I had the time, who would teach me how to use a sword?\u201d\nEven with his mask on, Kakashi somehow managed to look like she kicked his puppy or something. \u201cMah, Sakura-chan, my precious student. I could.\u201d\nAn old pain stung in her heart. She narrowed her eyes and replied with every intent on delivering a killing blow, \u201cDon\u2019t you have Naruto to train?\u201d\nHer former sensei looked up from his book and, maybe, finally, saw her. \u201cYes.\" He said softly in a way Sakura didn't know he could, closing his book, \"But now there is something I can teach you as well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t accept Kakashi\u2019s offer right away. Sakura wasn\u2019t joking when she said that it could only happen if she had the time. As it was, she was finally closing in on that time-space jutsu- it was almost ready for a field test- and she still had training with Tsunade and shifts at the hospital. Then she had a notebook of ideas she wanted to explore, medical jutsu that could save lives if she could figure out how to make them work. She was going to spend a foolish amount of her paycheck on fish in the future, she could just tell.\nBut water was forever in motion, even in the stillest of ponds. It would either find a new path or carve its way through an obstacle.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the end, she was glad she accepted Kakashi\u2019s help. Swordwork joined her repertoire smoothly, a back-up in case she was in a fight where chakra wouldn't help her. For reasons Sakura didn\u2019t fully understand, Tsunade broke into cackles whenever she saw Sakura with a short sword slung over the small of her back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPein attacked Konoha.\nEveryone died.\nOr not, because if there is one thing Tsunade-shishou came by honestly it was her stubbornness and her skills. There were hopes that Tsunade would recover from her coma.\nSakura actually crossed paths with Uchiha Itachi during the fight. She had many questions, so many, like \u2018how did he get out of the prison\u2019 and if he did escape why did he stick around? But he seemed to have been helping with the evacuation and was one of the few shinobi capable of handling a Path on his own, so Sakura settled for glaring at him and landed beside him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know how you got out, but if you are interested in really helping, Tsunade-shishou is that a way.\u201d The Uchiha regarded her before nodding and disappeared after the last civilian made it into the bunker. Sakura didn\u2019t think too much on it- the battle waited for no one.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShizune found her later at the lake, and through the older woman was obviously shaken up by what had taken place, tired and exhausted she managed a smile. She held a bundle close to her chest. \u201cTsunade was going to give this to you, as a gift.\u201d\nThe bundle had some weight to it when Sakura accepted it. Slowly, carefully, she unwrapped a sword from the silk. Intricate seal work covered the hilt, and briefest bit of lightning element chakra was amplified until it felt like she was holding a lightning bolt with one hand. \u201dWow.\u201d\n\u201dIt belonged to Tsunade\u2019s granduncle, the Nidaime.\u201d Shizune continued, watching as Sakura did some practice swings.\n\u201dThe Nidaime, as in the Nidaime Hokage?\u201d Sakura repeated, surprised. \u201cWhy would she give me this- it\u2019s a treasure of Konoha!\u201d\n\u201dShe didn\u2019t say. Only that she thought it would be of use to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe sword added a new element to her water jutsu. One that Sakura practiced with every chance she got because one day her life, and the life of her comrades, might depend on it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Tsunade awoke, Sakura learned that Itachi had taken on a Path and defended the Hokage to such an extent that Tsunade adjusted his sentence from execution to \u2018community service\u2019. In shinobi speak, Itachi was Tsunade\u2019s shiny new gopher in the tower. Sakura knew there was more going on than she was privy to, there had to be, for the Uchiha to be running like he was a loyal shinobi with only seals preventing him from using his Sharingan.\nShe was standing on the lake when the irony hit her: she had brought home a wayward Uchiha like she had promised she would.\nHe was just the wrong one.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe nailed the time/space jutsu and realized why it seemed familiar.\nShe knew what the history books called it, some on the man who made it and much more on the man who made it famous, and it raised a lot of questions about the origin of the scrolls on the shelf in her apartment. About her family and just why Tsunade was so interested in her background. It raised even more questions about the secrets of Hokages- especially after the one time she saw Naruto standing dead center in front of a coloured picture of the Yondaime and holy hell, how did she miss that?\nThere wasn't time to research her family or Naruto's though- war loomed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Fourth Shinobi War began.\nSakura had accepted that she would be kept from the front lines, caring for the wounded, until Tsunade narrowed her hazel eyes and set her loose. \u201cYou\u2019re exempt from the medic-nin laws. Go make sure Naruto doesn\u2019t get himself killed.\u201d\nWith a wolf-like smile, Sakura drew the Nidaime\u2019s blade, and disappeared in a flash of yellow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUsing the Haraishin was a thrill, like the first time she jumped off of a waterfall, confident and sure that the water would catch her. This jutsu was all about control, and not sheer brute strength; something, as a medic-nin, Sakura had in spades.\nShe tore through an army of white Zetsu in a blink of an eye, scattering kunai with a cherry blossom engraved on their hilts as she went, trying to reach her boys.\nSasuke\u2019s expression when she dodged his attacks and managed to hit him into the ground hard enough to shatter the earth made all the nights spent studying instead of sleeping worth it. (That Naruto let out an exuberant shout of, \"Go Sakura-chan! Kick his ass!\" when he saw the devastation just proved Naruto was the best teammate ever.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMadara fell- as would any enemy who had to bear the wrath of Team 7 and the Kages.\nKaguya learned the hard way about the true meaning of Dai-nana-han, and Sakura punched the Goddess hard enough to shake the heavens to protect her teammates and felt more than a little proud of the fact.\nIn the aftermath, Sakura could only watch as Naruto met a parent he had never known. Her brother, not by blood but family all the same, practically bounced- and Minato looked like he was just as excited to meet Naruto as Naruto was meeting him. A glance to the right showed the Uchiha siblings reconciling, she hoped. Itachi was sharing sticks of dango with Sasuke and nothing was on fire, so there was evidence no one was going to die any time soon on that end.\nShe itched to run to the river less than a mile away and jump in.\nInstead she turned to her second love and with a stick in hand she began sketching the base for a new medical jutsu she had been working on- supposing the kekkei genkei were just genetic flukes, how could she track them through their dormant stages? Someone blocked the sunlight she was working in.\nGlaring up, ready to ask them to move like three steps to the right, or left, she didn\u2019t care, Sakura nearly bit her tongue in half.\nThe Nidaime Hokage tilted his head in consideration before frowning slightly and crouching down beside Sakura. He gently grasped the stick she was using to draw in the dirt from her slack hand. Carefully, in a hand writing she had known almost all her life, he added a couple of notations in the top quadrant of the calculations.\nSakura blinked and redid the calculations in her mind. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 hm.\u201d She thought of the intended result and what that little change would do. \u201cThe jutsu would require less chakra to perform, but you risk the jutsu not working at all.\u201d She concluded aloud.\nThe man - re-animated corpse?- nodded, frowning slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He tilted his head like a cat before adding another notation at the bottom. \u201cThat would fix most of that problem.\u201d\n\u201dBut leave a bigger one here-\u201d Sakura snatched the stick back, and circled the offending piece.\n\u201dThat is not as big a problem as you think. See?\u201d The formerly dead Hokage pointed to the running tally Sakura had kept of the yin-yang chakra required for her jutsu. It still balanced. \u201cJutsu creation is an obscure art.\u201d\n\u201dYes it is,\u201d Sakura agreed, eyes drifting back to the familiar handwriting in the middle of her own scribbles. \u201cI was lucky. My family had scrolls left by my great-grandfather on the matter.\u201d\nRed eyes glanced at her. Yes, Sakura could see her grandmother in his face- or at least the nose. \u201cYou wield the Raijin.\u201d\n\u201dYes.\u201d Sakura smiled and stood up, \u201cI am Haruno Sakura, and I am glad I finally get to meet you.\u201d\nThe Nidaime stood up slowly, that famous mind of his working to put the pieces all together. A small smile touched his pale face. White hair. Red eyes. Albino, just like the history books said. \u201cSenju Tobirama.\u201d He replied, amused. \u201cAnd your family?\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t help her smile, no wonder Tsunade allowed her to continue her work with the scrolls. \u201cI am the daughter of Haruno Mebuki, who is the daughter of Kawa Kaoru.\u201d Sakura tilted her head, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to guess that Kaoru-oba-san was your daughter.\u201d\nA soft snort, almost remorseful. \u201cYes. Kaoru-chan is my daughter.\u201d He confirmed quietly. \u201cIs she\u2026?\u201d\nSakura shook her head in the negative. \u201cKaoru-oba-san passed away in her sleep years ago.\u201d Time to change the course- she had had enough of the men in her life sulking or brooding or running away to kill the Snake Sannin. \u201cI heard that you are a master of the water element.\u201d She glanced in the direction of the river she had felt earlier. The itch to swim hadn\u2019t faded.\nWhite brows furrowed slightly, and he turned to face the water over a mile away. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d\n\u201dThe water is my ally.\u201d That and more, but Sakura had a feeling Tobirama understood in a way so many couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll race you there.\u201d She was gone in a flash of yellow, a slightly-less-than-dead Hokage on her heels.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was weak once.\nShe is strong now.\nThe water loved her regardless."
