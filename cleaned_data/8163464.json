    "text": "\nMERLIN\n\nMerlin\u2019s in trouble.\nFirstly, he\u2019s a sorcerer in Camelot, of all places. And as he found out upon his recent arrival, the ban on magic is definitely not taken lightly (unlike sorcerers\u2019 heads). To add to that little problem, he\u2019s just been appointed as Prince Arthur\u2019s manservant, which means that not only does he have to have to scrub floors and muck stables, he has to try to be polite to someone who can otherwise have him thrown in the stocks. And politeness does not come naturally to Merlin. So, yes, he\u2019s definitely in trouble.\nHe doesn\u2019t know just how much trouble he\u2019s in until the day he tries telling Arthur how hideous he looks in that particular shade of red. It\u2019s a perfectly normal thing to tell the prince you\u2019re serving when he asks if he looks all right, thank you very much, and Merlin has previously insinuated a number of insulting things about the prince, so he expects no problems with uttering this one.\nBut instead of an insult, what comes out of Merlin\u2019s mouth is, \u201cYou look very majestic, sire.\u201d\nHe then promptly stumbles and drops the bucket of water he\u2019s carrying. Merlin did not mean to say that. Merlin meant to say the opposite of that, but instead the truth came out. Oh no. No no no.\nArthur snorts at the dropped bucket and growing puddle. He doesn\u2019t seem to think anything is amiss, probably because he already knows that Merlin trips and breaks things and throws things around way more than is normal.\n\"Go fetch a rag and clean that up,\" Arthur says. Merlin scurries to obey; Arthur calls after him, \"And Merlin? Cut the sarcasm.\"\nMerlin wonders, as he attempts to mops at the puddle with a rag, if maybe his tongue had just decided all on its own to be sarcastic? Merlin quite likes that explanation. It sounds much more pleasant than the other option, the one Merlin thought of immediately, which is that Merlin can't lie to Arthur because Arthur is his soulmate.\nMerlin pauses his mopping to bang his head on the stone floor.\nMerlin is a sorcerer who can't lie to the Prince of Camelot. How long can he possibly expect to live?\n*\nMerlin spends the next few days saying very little to Arthur at all, because ignorance is bliss and denial is very healthy for the soul, and all that. But this annoys Arthur and bores Merlin, and besides, ignorance is probably pretty dangerous in this instance. So Merlin decides to test it.\n(After all, a few days after the original incident, he\u2019s almost convinced himself that he was just being sarcastic. Clearly he\u2019s not soulmates with Prince Arthur; that would be ridiculous.)\nSo, as he and Arthur walk down the steps into the courtyard, Merlin says, \"The sky is a beautiful shade of green today.\"\nAt least, he tries to.\nOf course, what actually comes out is blue.\nArthur looks at him like he\u2019s out of his mind. \"Have you been drinking, Merlin?\"\nDrinking. Now that sounds like a great idea.\n*\nGaius notices something is wrong, of course, because he always does.\n\"What have you done now?\" he asks, demonstrating a worrying lack of faith in Merlin that is, sadly, entirely warranted.\n\"I haven't really done anything,\" Merlin says. (He finds he appreciates the ability to lie much more now that he realizes he's taken it for granted all his life.)\nGaius fixes him with a beady gaze and a raised eyebrow.\n\"I can't lie to Arthur,\" Merlin blurts.\n\"Merlin!\" Gaius scolds. \"You must keep hiding your magic from him. I know you feel guilty about lying, but he'd feel even worse about beheading you!\"\n\"No, you don't understand,\" Merlin says. \"I literally can't lie to him. He's my soulmate.\"\nGaius stares at him in horror.\n\"Sorry?\" Merlin says. He\u2019s not quite sure what he\u2019s apologizing for. In fact, he thinks the universe owes him an apology for this whole, awful situation.\n\"You're going to be the death of me,\" Gaius says.\nMerlin supposes that\u2019s likely to be true, but he\u2019s also pretty sure he\u2019ll be the death of himself first.\n*\nThe dragon thinks it\u2019s hilarious.\n*\nMerlin finds he can get around the not lying to Arthur problem by judiciously using a combination of sarcasm and silence. It helps that, when it comes to the magic, it's not like Arthur would ever believe him. He just laughs every time Merlin claims to have been using sorcery to save his life.\n\"Daydreaming this much can't possibly be good for you,\" he\u2019ll say. \"Or for the state of my chambers.\"\nArthur doesn't seem to mind that Merlin and he have this running joke about Merlin being a sorcerer. In fact, he seems to think it\u2019s funny. The only time he got annoyed was the one time Merlin mentioned using sorcery in front of other people.\nIt was only a couple of guards, but they had their hands on their swords almost immediately.\n\"He means nothing by it,\" Arthur had assured them, putting a hand on Merlin's shoulder protectively. \"He's very new here and he has a horrible sense of humour. Too thick to realize magic isn't funny, aren't you, Merlin?\"\n\"No,\" Merlin had said defensively, because he\u2019s very clever, actually, and he knows magic isn't funny. Magic is going to get him beheaded.\n\"Very thick,\" Arthur had said, shaking him slightly. \"I'll get it through his head, don't worry,\" he'd told the guards. \"There's no need to mention this to...anyone.\"\n\"Yes, sire,\" they'd agreed, and Arthur had dragged him off and given him a lecture about how he couldn't talk like that in front of anyone else, especially not nobles and absolutely never in front of the king.\nMerlin had nodded and agreed that it was dangerous, treasonous, and stupid, but he'd only been able to promise to try not to do it in front of other people. Fortunately Arthur has taken it to heart that his manservant is incredibly loose-lipped, and has stopped asking him hard questions like \"Where were you last night?\" anywhere other than the safety of Arthur's chambers.\nMerlin is incredibly grateful to have such a dunce as a soulmate.\n\u00a0\n\nARTHUR\n\nArthur notices from the minute he meets Merlin that there\u2019s something about him. Perhaps several somethings.\nFirst of all, ugly uneducated peasant or no, Merlin\u2019s funny. Arthur first ends up laughing at Merlin\u2019s humour unwillingly, when Merlin\u2019s insulting him in front of his own knights and the townspeople of Camelot. It\u2019s not exactly the best first impression, but when Arthur finds himself forced to keep company with Merlin, Merlin\u2019s humour is something he actually appreciates. It ensures that his company isn\u2019t boring in the slightest. Most people are either too respectful of Arthur\u2019s position to tease him or not clever enough to come up with witty remarks, but Merlin has precisely the opposite of both those problems. Arthur would claim that Merlin\u2019s banter is his favourite thing about him, but that would be a lie, because Merlin\u2019s got even more impressive qualities.\nBecause, ugly peasant or no, Merlin is the bravest person Arthur has ever met. Arthur notices this, too, when they first meet: Merlin stands up to him even though he\u2019s the prince, even though he\u2019s way bigger than Merlin, and even though he\u2019s clearly able to kill Merlin with his bare hands. Arthur notices it again when Merlin hunts monsters with him, and when Merlin drinks poison for him, and many other times between. Arthur\u2019s known hundreds of warriors, some of whom have been hailed as heroes, but none of them have had courage to equal Merlin\u2019s.\nAnd finally, frankly, Merlin\u2019s just\u2026 good. He has faith in people. He acts with kindness and compassion. He genuinely believes in justice and equality. From time to time, mainly when Merlin is disappointed in him, Merlin\u2019s goodness makes Arthur ashamed of himself. But mostly it makes Arthur want to be a better man himself.\nYes\u2026 there\u2019s definitely something about Merlin.\n(Also, not that it\u2019s important, but for an ugly peasant, Merlin has really pretty eyes and gorgeous cheekbones and adorable ears and possibly he isn't actually ugly at all. So. There\u2019s that.)\n*\nRegardless of what exactly the something about Merlin is, it has a very strong and unusual effect on Arthur.\nCase in point, around two months after being blessed/cursed with Merlin\u2019s servitude, Arthur comes back to his chambers earlier - and more quietly - than usual, and receives a rather large shock. Merlin is poking at the embers and slightly damp wood in Arthur\u2019s fireplace, and as Arthur watches, he sighs with frustration and mutters something.\nMerlin\u2019s eyes glow gold, and the fire bursts to life.\nArthur will reflect later that, as the crown prince who is sworn to uphold the laws of Camelot, he should have drawn his sword and run Merlin through immediately. The thought of doing so doesn\u2019t even cross his mind now, however. Instead, he immediately and silently backs out of his own room.\nArthur leans back on the wall just outside his room and takes one deep breath, then another.\nMerlin is a sorcerer. That\u2019s news. Merlin is an incredible fool. That\u2019s not news, though it is a problem.\nOnce the shock passes, Arthur finds himself\u2026 forgiving. He can\u2019t summon any anger. He feels vaguely upset and betrayed to have been lied to, but this is tempered by the fact that Merlin can\u2019t have known he\u2019d be safe in telling Arthur, given that Arthur himself can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not going to turn Merlin in.\nAnd he\u2019s definitely not going to turn him in. Arthur cannot think of an instance in which he has ever disobeyed one of his father\u2019s laws so flagrantly, or with so little cause, but he is absolutely not going to report Merlin\u2019s sorcery. He flinches from the mere idea. The thought of Merlin dying is\u2026 well, it\u2019s unthinkable.\nArthur collects himself with a final steadying breath, and then enters his chambers again, making sure to slam the door loudly this time around.\nIn the time Arthur spent in the hall, Merlin has moved across the room and is tidying Arthur\u2019s clothes. Upon Arthur\u2019s entrance, Merlin turns and his face brightens with a huge smile. He drops what he\u2019s holding, transferring all his attention to Arthur, and starts some inane tale about his day, as if it\u2019s Arthur\u2019s job to listen to Merlin\u2019s stories.\nArthur half-listens to Merlin\u2019s animated tale of his misadventures with the hunting dogs, as he comes to a realization. He\u2019s going to have to protect Merlin, the absolute fool, from the entire world and from his own foolish self. But there\u2019s absolutely nothing Arthur would rather do, and absolutely no one Arthur would rather be stuck with.\nMerlin is annoying and disrespectful and aggravating and brave and beautiful, and, in short, Arthur\u2019s in love with Merlin, something and all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMERLIN\n\nAfter a couple months of living in Camelot and serving Arthur, Merlin\u2019s perspective has changed slightly.\nFirst: he\u2019s willing to admit that the universe might be onto something after all. About Arthur being his soulmate, that is. True, the prince is a huge prat and occasionally a big bully. But he\u2019s also brave, kind, honourable, and frankly gorgeous. Merlin has only known him two months, but he\u2019d lay down his life to protect him, and he\u2019d do anything to earn one of his smiles. So, yes, maybe he\u2019s a little bit in love.\nSecond: Merlin may be in slightly less trouble than previously feared.\nArthur clearly hasn\u2019t found out about the magic yet, as Merlin is still in possession of his head. Merlin would think it was just a matter of time, except that he\u2019s quickly discovered Arthur is the most oblivious person Merlin has ever known. (This is evidenced by the fact that two entire months have passed and Arthur still hasn\u2019t realized they\u2019re soulmates.)\nWith the immediate danger postponed until Arthur gets a clue, which will seemingly take a very long while, Merlin can focus on the positive. Specifically: he\u2019s found the love of his life and he gets to spend every single day with him. It\u2019s kind of great. Sometimes when Merlin wakes up, he just lies there grinning for a few minutes before Gaius yells at him to get out of bed.\nMerlin finds it hilarious that Arthur hasn\u2019t figured out that they\u2019re soulmates. How could Arthur not notice that he can't lie to Merlin? They talk almost constantly. How hasn't Arthur tried to lie to him even once?\nTo be fair, it does make some sense that Arthur would be the last to know. Besides his general lack of observation skills providing a hindrance, it\u2019s also definitely true that Merlin has a lot more to lie about.\nMerlin doesn\u2019t want to outright tell Arthur, though. First of all, there\u2019s no fun in that. Also, Arthur often reacts badly to being told things outright. No matter what it\u2019s about, it\u2019s much better for all involved for Merlin to drop hints and help Arthur figure out what\u2019s going on, and then let him believe he found out on his own.\nSo Merlin hints. He prattles on about soulmates and stories of true love, to no effect.\n(Okay, not no effect, just not the intended effect. Instead, Arthur concludes that Merlin\u2019s an incorrigible romantic and starts teases him by making him lie to random passersby in case they\u2019re his soulmate.\n\u201cTry that woman, Merlin,\u201d Arthur says, gesturing to an old woman across the courtyard from them.\n\u201cTry what?\u201d Merlin asks.\n\u201cGo on, check if you can lie to her,\u201d Arthur says.\n\u201cHer? She\u2019s got to be older than Gaius!\u201d Merlin says.\nArthur shoves him until Merlin crosses the courtyard towards the woman and tells her that grass is blue. She glares at him and says, \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying, laddie, and I\u2019m too good for the likes of you!\u201d and beats him away with her broom. Arthur nearly pisses himself laughing.\nThis event happens to coincide with Merlin\u2019s decision to find new tactics.)\nNext he starts asking questions he thinks Arthur will lie to, but this fails as well because Arthur just refuses to answer. Sometimes he also shoves Merlin for his impertinence in asking, and sometimes he tackles Merlin and they end up play-fighting or wrestling, which is fun and so Merlin keeps prying, though he never succeeds at his main objective.\nMerlin drops all the hints he can think of, but Arthur never reacts - never realizes.\nAnd eventually - after three months living in Camelot, after an entire month of increasingly bold hints about their status as soulmates - Merlin comes to terms with the idea that there is no way Arthur hasn\u2019t noticed by now. He must have realized, right? But - he hasn\u2019t said a thing, hasn\u2019t started treating Merlin any differently, hasn\u2019t reacted to any of Merlin\u2019s hints. He has to know, but he\u2019s not saying anything.\nMerlin stops dropping hints.\nIt\u2019s clear that Arthur\u2019s rejecting him.\nMerlin tries not to take it personally. They\u2019re soulmates; Arthur has to love him back. Sometimes Merlin even sees flashes of that in Arthur\u2019s eyes, or in the way Arthur touches him. He tries to console himself with the notion that Arthur must want him, at least a little.\nMerlin\u2019s pretty sure he knows what the problem is. Arthur is the only heir to the throne of Camelot; Merlin is a peasant and a boy. Arthur needs to marry a princess, someone who will make Camelot stronger and who will be able to bear Arthur\u2019s children. Merlin can\u2019t do that.\nIf Arthur wasn\u2019t the prince, if he didn\u2019t have a duty to Camelot to secure an alliance through marriage and produce heirs, then maybe\u2026\nBut he does have that duty. And he obviously prioritizes that over Merlin. Not that Merlin blames him - he loves that Arthur\u2019s so dedicated to his people - but it still hurts to know that Arthur doesn\u2019t love Merlin enough to fight for him. (Doesn\u2019t even love Merlin enough to offer him an explanation, or any discussion - but Merlin\u2019s not going to challenge that, it\u2019s fine, he can deal with it. As long as Arthur lets him stay.)\nThe only thing that makes it bearable is that Arthur\u2019s letting Merlin stick around. Merlin isn\u2019t sure he can bear living without his soulmate\u2019s love, but he knows he couldn\u2019t deal with Arthur being far away from him, with not being able to protect him and cheer him up and hear his laugh. The only thing that could be worse than sticking around to watch Arthur marry some princess someday would be not being at Arthur\u2019s side when he does. So Merlin suffers through the torture of watching his soulmate but not being allowed to have him, because the other option is so much worse.\n\u00a0\n\nARTHUR\n\nIt\u2019s another couple months after discovering Merlin\u2019s magic that Arthur figures out the \u201csomething\u201d about Merlin is not his magic, or his personality, or whatever. It\u2019s that Merlin is his soulmate.\nIn Arthur\u2019s defense, he just hasn\u2019t bothered lying to Merlin. Lies are things Arthur uses in politics, when trying not to offend a lord by telling him his son resembled his neighbour more than him, or a lady by telling her his truthful opinion on her dress. Lies aren't things he should have to bother with when talking to his servant. He\u2019s the prince, and Merlin isn't allowed to judge him. Telling Merlin things is easy, anyways. So, he hasn\u2019t tried to lie to Merlin enough to notice he can't lie to Merlin, if that makes any sense.\nBut then, as Arthur is putting away his old cloak after he's gotten a new one, Merlin asks him about it. Well, the way Merlin asks about things.\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t where that goes, Arthur, give it here and I\u2019ll put it in the usual storage. Why are you trying to tidy up after yourself, anyways?\u201d\nArthur opens his mouth to give a perfectly reasonable explanation about Merlin\u2019s incompetent cleaning skills and/or mothballs.\n\"I'm putting it away for your Christmas present,\" Arthur says instead, then freezes.\nThat was supposed to be a surprise.\n\"Aww,\" Merlin coos. \"You're getting me a present? Should I get you one too?\"\n\"Maybe not anymore,\" Arthur snaps back.\nHe doesn't mean that, but he could say it. Does that mean he's not -? Or is it because he said maybe?\n\"Merlin,\" Arthur says, slowly.\n\"Arthur,\" Merlin replies in kind, looking at Arthur questioningly.\n\"Your ears are incredibly large,\" Arthur says, and winces, because he just tried to call them tiny. \"You could use the cloak to cover them.\"\n\"Ha, ha.\" Merlin crosses his arms.\nArthur stares at his soulmate. His gorgeous, amazing, wonderful soulmate, whom Arthur is already madly in love with. This means Merlin loves him too. This is the best day of Arthur\u2019s life. He can walk over there and grab Merlin and kiss him right now. There\u2019s nothing stopping him. In fact, why haven\u2019t he and Merlin been kissing already? Like, all of the time?\nDoes Merlin know? No, wait, of course Merlin knows. He probably tried to lie to Arthur a lot when he was first assigned as Arthur\u2019s servant, and kept breaking things and making messes instead of cleaning them up. Why hasn't he said anything? Has he been laughing at Arthur this whole time? Does he think it\u2019s funny that Arthur\u2019s completely oblivious?\n\u201cArthur? Why\u2019re you staring at me? Do I have something on my face, or have you just forgotten how to hold a conversation again?\u201d\nHe does, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s probably snickering into his sleeve all the time; it\u2019s hilarious to him that Arthur hasn\u2019t figured it out yet. Actually, set Merlin aside for a second, Arthur thinks it's ridiculous he hadn't noticed. He'd spent all day, every day for four months with Merlin, and half that time he'd been in love with him, and it had taken him until now to realize Merlin was his soulmate? Arthur feels like the biggest fool in the room, which is saying something considering who's in the room with him.\nHe can't believe he didn't think to try lying to Merlin when he realized he was in love, but it honestly hadn't crossed his mind. He supposes he'd just unconsciously assumed Merlin wasn't, based on the improbability of going months without even trying to lie to Merlin, and the hundreds of love-at-first-sight soulmate stories he's heard all his life. But that's not important. What's important is that Arthur knows now. So what is he going to do about it?\nArthur grins. Yes, swooping over and kissing Merlin right now would be highly enjoyable, but there\u2019s something to be said for delayed gratification, too. Merlin\u2019s been laughing at Arthur for ages, and now Arthur can turn the tables on him. He can keep acting oblivious, and start courting Merlin, and see how long it takes Merlin to crack. This is going to be hilarious.\nArthur can\u2019t wait.\n*\nA few days later, Arthur is at Merlin\u2019s door with a small wrapped gift for him in one hand. Arthur\u2019s got lots of plans for courting Merlin: flowers and candy and picnics and dinners with just the two of them, for a start. And even though he thought this up as a joke to turn the tables on Merlin, he\u2019s also really looking forward to it seriously. It\u2019ll be nice to court Merlin, to treat him like someone precious to Arthur for once, and to make him happy, and \u2026\nArthur decides to stop smiling at nothing outside Merlin\u2019s door, and barges inside.\nMerlin\u2019s back is to him, so Arthur can\u2019t see Merlin\u2019s eyes, but he knows they\u2019re golden, because everything in Merlin\u2019s room is hovering a few inches off the floor. Merlin must hear him, though, because he frantically ends the spell and whirls around.\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Arthur asks, as always.\n\u201cUh, never mind, there was\u2026 a total lack of nothing that was not natural to see here! Nothing that wasn\u2019t illegal definitely didn\u2019t not happen here!\u201d\nArthur cannot, after several moments of trying, figure out what Merlin is saying, although that\u2019s not an unusual occurrence for him. Merlin is weird. But this reminds him of something that makes his heart sink into his boots: Merlin has lied to him.\nMerlin has pretended not to be a sorcerer for months. He must\u2019ve told Arthur countless lies - successful lies - in that time. Merlin can lie to him.\n\nMerlin can lie to him.\n\nArthur shoves the present down deep into his pocket. He mutters an excuse to Merlin about forgetting what he was doing here. Halfway through Merlin\u2019s teasing reply, he turns and stumbles back out the door. He nearly trips down the stairs in his haste to get away, and maybe because his vision is a little blurry from tears.\nMerlin can lie to him.\nMerlin is Arthur\u2019s soulmate. But Arthur isn\u2019t Merlin\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\nMERLIN\n\nArthur\u2019s been acting weird for a couple weeks when Lancelot shows up.\nLancelot is brave and noble and handsome and wonderful, but the thing is, he\u2019s not Arthur. He isn\u2019t a great big blond prat and apparently, in Merlin\u2019s eyes, that\u2019s a bad thing, so when Lancelot asks him out, Merlin blushes and turns him down as gently as possible.\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered, really I am,\u201d Merlin stammers out. \u201cYou\u2019re great! You\u2019re really great. But, there\u2019s someone else. I mean, there\u2019s the someone else, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh! Oh, congratulations!\u201d Lancelot says. He then takes in the sour look on Merlin\u2019s face and adds, \u201cOr not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Merlin says. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but\u2026 he\u2019s it, for me.\u201d\nLancelot wishes him luck and is exactly as chivalrous about it as you\u2019d expect him to be. Anyways, there isn\u2019t time for it to be awkward before Lancelot leaves again, as quickly as he\u2019d come.\nAnd it turns out that the fact that Merlin didn\u2019t ever technically sleep with Lancelot doesn\u2019t stop him from bringing it up with Arthur the next time Arthur\u2019s being a huge prat. It\u2019s not very mature, of course, but who ever said Merlin was mature? And is Merlin really expected to hold on to civility when Arthur\u2019s shoving Merlin\u2019s lack of lover in his face, like it\u2019s not entirely Arthur\u2019s fault Merlin doesn\u2019t have anyone?\nIt happens during a night at an inn with Arthur\u2019s knights, who are competing for the serving girl\u2019s favour. Arthur leans over to Merlin and teases, \u201cNot even trying? Have you given up because you know you don\u2019t stand a chance?\u201d\nOn one hand, it\u2019s the same sort of insulting mockery Arthur hassles Merlin with continuously about absolutely everything else. If they weren\u2019t soulmates, Merlin would expect and accept this subject of teasing from Arthur as well.\nBut Arthur is his soulmate, and he\u2019s rejected Merlin, and Arthur can\u2019t seriously think it\u2019s okay to tease Merlin about not being good enough.\nSo Merlin snaps back - hoping this wounds Arthur at least a little, that he experiences at least a fraction of the agony Merlin would in his shoes - \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m highly attractive to many people. Lancelot, for one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Arthur says, and yes, he winces. It makes Merlin feel simultaneously victorious and awful.\n\u201cYou slept with Lancelot?\u201d Arthur asks.\nMerlin doesn\u2019t feel awful enough to outright deny it, though. \u201cA gentleman never kisses and tells.\u201d\nArthur gives a very fake-sounding chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re no gentleman, Merlin, spill.\u201d\nMerlin crosses his arms over his chest and keeps his lips firmly shut.\nIf he tells, he\u2019ll lose Arthur\u2019s jealousy - the only proof he has that Arthur cares at all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nARTHUR\n\nArthur draws his sword and viciously attacks the practice dummies set up on the training grounds.\nHe\u2019s in a quandary.\nIt\u2019s all Lancelot\u2019s fault. Arthur hates Lancelot.\nNo, that isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s not all Lancelot\u2019s fault. If Arthur hadn\u2019t brought it up, he\u2019d still be blissfully ignorant. If only he hadn\u2019t thought, I should tease Merlin about girls; it\u2019s weird if I don\u2019t, then he wouldn\u2019t have had to listen to Merlin talking about sleeping with Lancelot.\nAnd he shouldn\u2019t hate Lancelot. Lancelot saved Merlin\u2019s life. He also saved Arthur and Camelot. Arthur shouldn\u2019t detest someone just because his manservant likes them better than he likes Arthur.\n\u2026Arthur hates Lancelot.\nArthur brutally stabs a practice dummy; straw rains down onto the ground.\nThe thing is, even though Arthur feels like he\u2019s being stabbed every time Merlin mentions his admiration of and attraction to Lancelot.\nEven though Arthur has made himself sick thinking about Lancelot and Merlin sharing Merlin\u2019s tiny room with its single, tiny bed.\nEven though Arthur may have cried himself to sleep last night.\nThere is one, very small, piece of goodness to come out of this whole debacle with the gryphon and the gorgeous warrior: Arthur now knows Merlin likes men.\nAnd Lancelot is gone. Which is of course unfortunate, because he was a strong warrior and a valiant knight, but Arthur isn\u2019t going to ignore the positive implications. Specifically: for the moment, Merlin\u2019s heart is free.\nArthur knows that he isn\u2019t Merlin\u2019s soulmate, and Arthur will, inevitably, always love Merlin more than Merlin loves him. But what if he could have some small amount of happiness with Merlin anyways? He could court Merlin, and even if it doesn\u2019t last, maybe it would be better to have a small taste of what it could be like, than to never have anything at all.\nOn the other hand, what if it ruined everything? If asking to court Merlin changed their relationship forever and destroyed their friendship? Arthur has managed to live without courting Merlin so far, and he thinks he could bear it if friendship was all he was ever allowed; but he isn\u2019t so sure he could live with less than that.\nArthur gives a low yell and hurls his sword into the dirt at his feet. He stares at the small army of practice dummies he has decimated. Suddenly he is exhausted, and sad, and defeated.\nThe worst part of having problems with your soulmate, Arthur thinks, is that you can\u2019t go cry on the shoulder of the one person that always makes you feel better.\n\u00a0\n\nMERLIN\n\nBeing rejected by his soulmate isn\u2019t exactly a pleasant experience. Merlin can\u2019t bring himself to date anyone else, and his constant solitude (and celibacy) earns him mockery from some and concern from others. Some days he mopes around, wondering what the point is when his life is doomed to never include a partner to share it with. The bards\u2019 stories about soulmates are probably not just there to taunt Merlin, but it feels like it. And some days Merlin can\u2019t keep his bitterness from invading his attitude and he\u2019s going to ruin even his friendship with Arthur at this rate.\nAnd yet, Merlin swears he would never complain about any of this ever again, if only the damn Princess Deidre would go away.\nThe rumours of her and Arthur\u2019s impending betrothal have been flying for days, and it\u2019s making Merlin miserable. Even worse, Arthur isn\u2019t miserable. Usually he frowns and objects when Uther brings up the inevitability of Arthur\u2019s strategically arranged marriage, but he isn\u2019t doing much frowning at the princess.\nThey go riding together (Arthur compliments her seat) and on picnics together (Arthur smiles when she politely thanks Merlin for carrying the food and blankets). Arthur gives her flowers and makes her laugh when they sit beside each other at dinner.\nMerlin has never hated anyone this much in his entire life.\nIt\u2019s not that he thought he had a chance. He wasn\u2019t that naive. If he had a bloody chance Arthur would\u2019ve mentioned it by now.\nBut, okay, maybe a little part of him did wonder if Arthur\u2019s objection to arranged marriages had to do with his soulmate being right here. Maybe that part of him had thought he had a chance.\n*\nMerlin had thought he couldn\u2019t feel worse, until he and Arthur talk, and he discovers that not only does he not have a chance, he apparently isn\u2019t even a consideration.\nArthur opens the conversation out of the blue. Merlin is just minding his own business, mending Arthur\u2019s shirt (and regretting being snappish with Gwen), when Arthur ambushes him with, \u201cPrincess Deirdre is very beautiful.\u201d\nMerlin jabs the needle through his finger. \u201cIf you say so, sire,\u201d he mutters, sucking on his injury before the blood can stain Arthur\u2019s shirt.\n\u201cShe\u2019s kind, intelligent, a good rider - far better than you,\u201d Arthur says.\n\u201cRight, well, that\u2019s not hard.\u201d Merlin somehow manages to choke out the self-effacing joke despite the needle of pain stabbing his heart. How can Arthur compare Merlin to someone else, and think Merlin is the one who falls short? Merlin is his soulmate, his destiny, how can he -\n\u201cI think she\u2019ll make a very good queen.\u201d\nMerlin gapes at him. Actually, he gapes at Arthur\u2019s back, which is turned to him as Arthur stares out the window, because Arthur isn\u2019t even bothering to look at Merlin for this horrible conversation. It\u2019s not that something interesting is happening outside - all is quiet and it\u2019s dark as pitch out there, clouds covering the full moon, so Arthur can\u2019t be seeing anything but blackness. It\u2019s just that Merlin apparently isn\u2019t worth his attention.\nMerlin closes his mouth before Arthur turns around and demands what Merlin\u2019s problem is. He knows Arthur will get cranky if he doesn\u2019t respond, so he manages a halfhearted, \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, I obviously don\u2019t love her now,\u201d Arthur says. And then he stops Merlin\u2019s heart with, \u201cBut maybe, someday\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Merlin repeats, the sound practically punched from him.\nArthur finally turns away from the window. \u201cCan you say anything else?\u201d he asks, crankily.\nMerlin blinks back his tears and snaps, \u201cI can say clotpole.\u201d\nArthur smirks. \u201cCongratulations. Anyways. I suppose marrying the princess won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d\n\u201cReally now,\u201d Merlin says.\nApparently some of his bitterness seeps through - how did that happen! like maybe he has too much to contain or something! - because Arthur scowls and demands, \u201cJust what is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I always thought you cared a little about marrying someone you loved?\u201d Merlin says, because he is a fool, an absolute fool, and likes to poke bears and sleeping dragons.\nArthur\u2019s eyes turn steely and cold. \u201cDid I ask for your opinion, Merlin? No. And frankly, your opinion on who I should marry is completely irrelevant.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nARTHUR\n\nA week later, Uther tells Arthur that the treaty is going to be possible without a marriage, and that Arthur would be better off marrying a richer princess anyways. Arthur is perhaps a little rude in receiving this news, because his manservant hasn\u2019t been speaking to him in a week and he discovered partway through this meeting that his shirt has a huge and only half-mended hole in it. Uther doesn\u2019t notice, though, as he thanks Arthur for his cooperation and praises him on his dedication to his duty.\nAfterwards, Arthur goes back to his quarters to change his shirt. Merlin is there, cleaning his armour in total silence.\nArthur\u2019s been trying to keep up their conversations, no matter how one-sided they\u2019ve been lately, and Uther\u2019s news is good in that it gives him a new topic. As Merlin brings him a new shirt without actually looking at him, Arthur tells him about it.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve just been to see my father,\u201d he says. \u201cApparently I\u2019m not to be asked to marry Deidre after all. Her father asked for help from some of Camelot\u2019s knights, you see, and Father thinks that having some of our knights move to his lands will be almost as solid a link between us as a marriage.\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s eyes actually flick towards Arthur. Encouraged, Arthur goes on, \u201cSo nothing\u2019s to come of it, although I suppose it wasn\u2019t a total waste of time to court Deidre. At least I know now that it won\u2019t be so horrible to marry a princess - might actually be quite nice.\u201d\nApparently that was the wrong thing to say, as Arthur now has two ripped shirts.\n*\nArthur endures another entire week of Merlin being respectful and subservient and just generally giving Arthur the cold shoulder before he cracks.\n\u201cBy your leave, highness,\u201d Merlin says as he goes to leave for the night.\n\u201cMerlin, wait,\u201d Arthur says to his back. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, all right? I don\u2019t know exactly why you\u2019re mad, but I know I\u2019m, well, a bit of a clotpole sometimes, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the right - but will you just forgive me and be my friend again? Please?\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s shoulders are stiff, and there\u2019s a few moments of silence. Arthur waits. Then Merlin blows out a huge breath of air, shoulders relaxing, and turns around. His eyes are bright and wet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a huge clotpole. The absolute biggest,\u201d Merlin says.\nIt\u2019s the first time Merlin\u2019s insulted him in days, which makes it the most beautiful thing Arthur\u2019s ever heard.\n\u201cTry not to make me regret apologizing already,\u201d Arthur says, and throws a pillow at him.\nMerlin goes, and Arthur\u2019s chest feels lighter knowing they\u2019re back to normal, even if normal is nothing near what Arthur actually wants.\n\u00a0\n\nMERLIN\n\nMerlin has given up all hope of living with his soulmate by the time he and Arthur get captured by enemy soldiers just outside Camelot\u2019s border. (What were they doing in hostile territory outside the border? you may ask. It has absolutely nothing to do with Merlin running away from a bear, thank you very much.)\nFortunately, their cell isn\u2019t closely guarded, and they quickly liberate themselves into the relative freedom of the maze-like castle they were stashed in. Unfortunately, there\u2019s about twenty guards and soldiers between them and the way out - and they don\u2019t even have any weapons.\n\u201cI\u2019ll distract them,\u201d Merlin hisses. \u201cYou run.\u201d\nMerlin is about to jump out at the guards without waiting for agreement - Arthur can\u2019t argue with the logic that the crown prince\u2019s life is more important than a servant\u2019s, after all - but he\u2019s quickly yanked back by a strong grip on the back of his neckerchief.\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you sacrifice yourself for me,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cThere must be another way out.\u201d\n\u201cMust there?\u201d Merlin says sarcastically. \u201cEvery second we waste arguing about it means we\u2019re that much closer to both of us being caught.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cThen you run, and I\u2019ll distract them.\u201d\nMerlin laughs humourlessly. \u201cArthur, even if you weren\u2019t the prince of Camelot, I would never let you do that. I\u2019m not living without you. I can\u2019t bear living without my soulmate, but you were planning to anyways. So just leave me and go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Arthur says. He\u2019s staring at Merlin in shock, his grip on Merlin\u2019s neckerchief loosening like he\u2019s forgotten all about the enemy guards that Merlin wants to throw himself at. \u201cWhat - I\u2019m not - but you can lie to me!\u201d\nArthur didn\u2019t know? \u201cWait, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d Merlin demands. \u201cTest it, right now, tell me you\u2019re a dancing bear.\u201d\n\u201cI know I can\u2019t lie to you,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cBut you can, to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen have I ever lied to you?\u201d\nArthur stares pointedly at him and says, in an imitation of Merlin that for some reason involves a very high-pitched voice, \u201cNo, Arthur, I\u2019m not a sorcerer! It\u2019s just that I have very good luck and trees have very weak branches!\u201d\nWhat.\nMerlin was ready to have a conversation about how he and Arthur are utterly doomed soulmates. He\u2019s been preparing for this conversation for a while now. He\u2019s pictured having it in various different situations, from yelling it in front of the court to whispering it under the covers of Arthur\u2019s bed. He\u2019s more than ready.\nHe is not ready to have a conversation about how he\u2019s a sorcerer and Arthur apparently knows.\nHe steps back. \u201cOh gods,\u201d he says, and then puts the sorcerer thing aside for a minute - because what else is he supposed to do with it - and addresses the other issue at hand. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find what I said was, \u2018yes Arthur I\u2019m the most powerful sorcerer you\u2019ll ever meet,\u2019 and then I relied you being too much of an enormous clotpole to believe me.\u201d\nArthur takes a minute to think about this, then he whispers, \u201cOh.\u201d\nMerlin takes that minute to think as well, about what must have been going through Arthur\u2019s mind, if he thought Merlin could lie to him. When he realizes, he wants to wrap Arthur up in a big hug and never let go. \u201cYou thought I didn\u2019t love you?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur admits. \u201cAnd...so did you?\u201d\nMerlin shrugs slightly. \u201cI thought you loved me, just\u2026 not enough.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always said you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cI guess now we have proof.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a prat,\u201d Merlin says.\nThey beam at each other.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cHow\u2019s this for a plan: you knock all those men out with magic, and then we run away and make out?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Merlin says.\n\u00a0\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nIt always seems, during their life-or-death experiences, that life won\u2019t go back to normal afterwards. It seems impossible to go on as usual after, for example, Arthur nearly sacrifices his life for Merlin\u2019s, or gives one of his grand speeches about equality. Still, somehow Merlin always ends up back to polishing armour and fetching meals, with only a new scar or two to show for their adventures, and this time is no different.\n\u201cMerlin, once you\u2019re done staring at absolutely nothing, how would you like to polish my armour?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, sire,\u201d Merlin says. He stretches out a hand and his eyes flash gold, and the armour starts polishing itself. He smiles cheerfully at Arthur, and then flops back onto Arthur\u2019s bed.\nWell, maybe this time is a little different.\nArthur smiles back as he reclines in his chair. It\u2019s not a very restful smile; it\u2019s almost predatory. \u201cYou know what I find amusing, Merlin?\u201d\n\u201cI imagine you find many small things amusing, such as poop jokes and children\u2019s clowns,\u201d Merlin says.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Arthur says, ignoring Merlin\u2019s hilarious witticisms. \u201cYou really would love to polish my armour. You like to pretend you\u2019re being sarcastic, but you forget that I know now that everything you say to me is completely true.\u201d\nMerlin blushes and tries to redirect with, \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d\nArthur cannot be distracted. He goads, \u201cI know I\u2019m your favourite person. You liiiike me.\u201d\nMerlin retorts brilliantly, \u201cI do not.\u201d\nExcept, of course, he obviously doesn\u2019t say that, because it is the opposite of true. Instead what comes out is, \u201cI like you a lot.\u201d\nArthur grins in delight. \u201cI bet you think I\u2019m handsome.\u201d\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Merlin says, because it is: \u201cIt is ridiculous how adorable you are. I mean, you\u2019re easily the most handsome man in Camelot, but you\u2019re just so cute.\u201d\n\u201cI am a warrior,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cI have been trained to kill from birth, I am not cute.\u201d\nMerlin sits up, realizing he has the upper hand. \u201cBut Arthur, I can\u2019t lie to you, and I think you\u2019re adorable. You\u2019re the absolute cutest. You\u2019re like, so beautiful and cuddly and I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the adorable one!\u201d Arthur argues. \u201cWith your ears and your \u2026 everything. You\u2019re the cute one!\u201d\nMerlin stares at him, and Arthur stares back. Finally Merlin breaks and starts giggling.\nIf all he and Arthur have to fight about is who\u2019s cuter, Merlin thinks they\u2019ll be okay."
