    "text": "\u201cAnd you add in another section of hair to the right side, bring the whole thing into the middle\u2014just like your normal, three-strand braid\u2014and switch hands because we\u2019re moving to the left side now. And add in another section of hair from the left, bring the whole thing to the center. And repeat. Over and over and over, all the way down.\u201d\nThe camera focused in on the long, nimble fingers braiding the little girl\u2019s blonde hair, creating an even, tight, straight French braid down the back of her head. It was hypnotizing.\n\u201cAnd then when you\u2019ve got all of her hair in the braid,\u201d Mr. S continued, \u201cjust start braiding it like you would a normal, three-strand braid all the way down to the bottom. Then tie it off with a hair tie, and you\u2019re done! Go you!\u201d\nMr. S was in his late twenties or early thirties, with brown eyes, devil-may-care brown hair that never had a strand out of place, a stupidly bright smile, and long, graceful fingers.\nHis young daughter, Little S, was seated on the counter of the bathroom as her father braided her hair. You could see her own bright grin and matching brown eyes in the mirror. She held up a polk-adotted blue ribbon, waving it back and forth until Mr. S took it from her.\n\u201cAnd\u2014just because Little S loves her bows\u2014I\u2019m going to tie her a nice big blue one at the very end,\u201d Mr. S added, tying the ribbon into a perfectly balanced bow with his stupidly magic fingers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it! The French braid. Be sure to check out our channel for other basic braiding videos, or for some more advanced stuff if you\u2019re feeling up to the challenge. Thanks for watching Daddy Do\u2019s!\u201d\nThe video ended, and squares of other YouTube videos popped up on the now-black screen.\nDerek stared down at his own daughter\u2019s hair in despair.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHe could braid.\nOr, well, he\u2019d thought he could braid. He\u2019d learned to do a three-strand braid with strips of leather in Cub Scouts, and it transferred to hair easily enough, so that was that. Braiding. But then Lydia had started kindergarten and all he\u2019d been hearing for the last month was, \u201cI want princess hair. The other girls have princess hair, and I want princess hair, too, because I\u2019m a princess! Aren\u2019t I a princess, Daddy?\u201d\nSo Derek found himself plunged into a world of hair-braiding. And Jesus Christ, who knew there were so many different types of braids? French, Dutch, lace, waterfall, fishbone, English, rope, twists\u2026 And then you could do them in all manner of patterns and directions across the scalp.\nThen he\u2019d found Daddy Do\u2019s.\nDaddy Do\u2019s was a YouTube channel made by a cute guy under the pseudonym Mr. S, and his daughter Little S, with over a hundred videos on \u201chairstyles made easy, so even we dads can do them.\u201d His videos ranged from simple how-to-French-braid to elaborate wedding hairstyles that Derek had no hope of ever creating (but he\u2019d still watched the videos, ostensibly for Lydia but actually because Mr. S had ridiculous, hypnotizing, magical fingers).\nMostly, he stuck to the \u201ccheat hairstyles\u201d, which were designed for people like Derek who could not master anything more complicated than a ponytail or a simple braid.\nUnfortunately, Lydia was no longer satisfied with that. \u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Derek was going to learn to French braid if it killed him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOw, ow, ow, ow, OW!\u201d Lydia screeched. She tried to yank her head away, but Derek\u2019s fingers were hopeless tangled in the fine red strands and it only made her shriek in pain and then burst into tears.\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Derek muttered, frantically trying to finger-comb the rat\u2019s nest out.\n\u201cI\u2019m never gonna have princess hair!\u201d Lydia wailed, scrambling off the couch and down the hallway, tiny feet pounding on the hardwood floor. Seconds later, her door slammed shut.\n\u201cCrap,\u201d said Derek, and then went to find the Daddy Do\u2019s video on detangling children\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\nLaura knew how to French braid, but was sadly thousands of miles across the country in California, giving lectures on safe, sane, consensual BDSM practices (\u201cThe only good part of Fifty Shades of Grey is the part where it got me a job,\u201d was one of her favorite opening lines).\n\u201cShe won\u2019t let me try again,\u201d Derek informed Laura. \u201cShe says she\u2019s been traumatized, and requires at least a week to recover from my blundering attempts at princess hair.\u201d\n\u201cIn those words?\u201d\n\u201cIn those words.\u201d\n\u201cChrist,\u201d said Laura. \u201cYou really need to get her IQ tested.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Derek said impatiently, because he\u2019d heard the same thing from Lydia\u2019s teacher just last night at parent-teacher conferences. \u201cLook, I just\u2014do you have any advice? Friends in New York?\u201d\n\u201cWho could\u2026 teach you to French braid?\u201d Laura asked slowly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d Derek said, sighing. \u201cI even\u2014there\u2019s this YouTube video, I\u2019ve watched it probably a thousand times. I know intellectually how to do it, I just can\u2019t figure out how to hold the damn hair. It keeps getting tangled instead of braided.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think maybe you\u2019re making this out to be a bit of a bigger deal than it really is?\u201d Laura suggested tentatively.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d a parenting thing, he almost said, but Derek caught himself at the last minute. At last update the fertility treatments had been oh-for-twenty for Laura.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Laura asked.\n\u201cSchool pictures are coming up,\u201d Derek finally said, which was also true.\nLaura snorted. \u201cDerek, I know we haven\u2019t been in school for a while, but I\u2019m pretty sure they still photograph your face, not the back of your head.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek replied.\n\"Uh-huh. I really don\u2019t know what you want me to tell you, little brother. I can\u2019t Apparate over to New York, braid Lydia\u2019s hair, and then Disapparate in time for On the RACK: Is It Stretching Ethics to Its Limits?\u201d\nDerek rolled his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe people actually hire you.\u201d\n\u201cShut your face, my titles are the best.\u201d\nWhich reminded him.\n\"Speaking of titles,\u201d he said, \u201cdid Mom tell you Uncle Wilbur\u2019s decided to pass his retirement years by writing a book?\u201d\nLaura groaned \u201cOh, God. Yes. We\u2019re going to have to read it, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. Can\u2019t someone just, like, tell him that there is no need for another eight hundred page book about the planes of World War I?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe attempted to corral Lydia into another French braiding trial, but she flat-out refused. Derek tried not take it personally, and kept a wide berth from the cabinet with the photo albums, where Kate\u2019s face was waiting to remind him of all his failures.\n\u00a0\nIt was t-minus five days to picture day when Derek got home late from work\u2014he\u2019d been at a bike factory an hour out of the city, and they\u2019d had a string of EPA violations so long Derek had had to use notebook paper to finish listing them\u2014and was immediately accosted by his daughter.\n\u201cDADDDYYYYYY!\u201d Lydia squealed, leaping at him and climbing up his body like he was her own personal jungle-gym. \u201cDaddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!\u201d\nBoyd, the babysitter, smirked languidly from the couch.\nDerek scrambled to get a hold on her before she accidentally kicked him in the nuts.\n\u201cGuess what?\u201d she demanded, levering herself up so her face was inches from his own. \u201cGuess what, guess what, guess what? Little S, from Daddy Do\u2019s, she\u2019s in my class. Her name\u2019s Erica Stilinski and her daddy is Mr. S because he\u2019s Mr. Stilinski, get it? And she had the best princess hair ever today, she had a heart in her hair made out of braids and pink lace. Pink lace, Daddy.\u201d\nDerek had watched the tutorial for that hairstyle. At least five times. Mr. S had kept up a spirited debate with his daughter throughout the video on whether Batman or Spiderman would win in a fight.\nBut, wait.\nLittle S was in Lydia\u2019s class?\n\u201cIs she new?\u201d Derek asked, frowning.\nLydia gave him an impatient look. \u201cDuh. She moved here from Michigan. She said sometimes it snowed so much that she and her daddy would have to use a snowmobile to get to school, but I think she\u2019s lying.\u201d\nDerek swallowed. \u201cDepends on which half of Michigan they\u2019re from.\u201d\nMr. S\u2014Mr. Stilinski, apparently\u2014had moved here, to the suburbs of Albany. He probably lived within twenty miles of Derek\u2019s apartment.\nGod, that was\u2026 weird.\n\u201cMr. Hale?\u201d Boyd said, having dragged himself off the couch and slung his backpack over his shoulder.\n\"Right,\u201d said Derek, letting Lydia down and taking out his wallet. \u201cIt was, what, two hours? What did I pay you last time?\u201d\nWhy had Mr. Stilinski moved here?\n\u201cTwenty,\u201d Boyd replied.\nDaddy Do\u2019s uploaded a new video every Saturday night, and Derek had just watched the latest one yesterday. There had been no signs of Mr. Stilinski and his family picking up and moving across the country in it\u2014no boxes or bins, all clutter and homeliness and\u2014\n\u201cActually,\u201d said Boyd, \u201cI just remembered. It was thirty.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Derek vaguely, and pulled out an extra ten.\nChrist, he\u2019d probably run into their family at Whole Foods or Target or something. Would it be weird to say something? Would Mr. Stilinki\u2019s wife think it was weird?\nThe door shut behind Boyd.\nWhat was his wife even li\u2014\n\u201cYou paid him twenty last time,\u201d Lydia piped up helpfully.\nDerek blinked. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nCrap, he had.\nHe glared half-heartedly at his daughter. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say something because\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cMistakes are just another way of learning,\u201d she said, wide-eyed and serious.\nDerek groaned and toed off his shoes, moving into the kitchen to stare mournfully into his alcohol-free fridge.\n\u201cIs Boyd gonna watch me tomorrow? Lydia asked, following him.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll pick you up from Latchkey like normal,\u201d Derek said. He glanced back at her. \u201cI thought you liked Boyd?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Lydia said innocently.\nDerek frowned harder.\nLydia skipped away, humming.\n\u00a0\nDerek spent all night convincing himself not to rewatch the entirety of the Daddy Do\u2019s channel.\n\u00a0\nHe discovered what, exactly, the fruit of his loins had been up to when he went to pick her up from Latchkey the following day.\nUsually when he came to pick up Lydia, she had everything ready to go and only had to pull on her coat before they could leave. Today, though, she seemed to have taken every single item out of her backpack\u2014and papers out of their folders, eraser caps off of their pencils\u2014and waited for Derek to arrive before starting to put it all back in.\n\u201cLydia, we have to get home and start dinner,\u201d Derek reminded her.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lydia said sweetly, carefully slotting the next piece of paper into the pocket of her folder.\nDerek held in a sigh. \u201cLydia.\u201d\n\"If you\u2019re going to do something, then you should do it right, Daddy,\u201d Lydia informed him, smoothing down another piece of paper.\nDerek resisted the urge to beat his head against the wall.\nTwo minutes later, the door to the gym opened and Mr. Stilinski strode in, flushed and windswept, grinning hugely.\nDerek froze.\nLydia shoved all of her papers into her folder, slammed it shut, and swept everything into her backpack in less than five seconds. She zipped it up, hooked it over her shoulders, and skipped over to where Mr. Stilinski was kneeling to give Little S\u2014Erica a bear hug. Her blonde hair was done up in two little worm buns with purple ribbons around them.\nDerek\u2019s stomach flipped. His chest felt funny.\nHe raced after his daughter.\n\u201cHi Mr. S!\u201d Lydia said pertly, in a voice that made her actually sound her age instead how she usually spoke. \u201cMy name\u2019s Lydia, and this is my daddy. His name is Derek Andrew Hale and he watches all of your videos a lot, but he still can\u2019t braid.\u201d\n\u201cLydia,\u201d Derek said, ears burning, as he came to a stop behind her.\nMr. Stilinski raised his eyebrows and looked up at Derek, expression somewhere between amused and bewildered, before focusing on Lydia again.\n\u201cHi, Lydia,\u201d he said holding out a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\nLydia shook his hand solemnly. Then she looked up at Derek and announced, \u201cI have to pee!\u201d\nShe ran off, hair streaming behind her because Derek had overslept this morning and hadn\u2019t even had time to put it in a simple braid. Crap. He should have done it while she ate her cereal, because what Lydia had said wasn\u2019t true. He could braid. A little.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Stilinski, and Derek suddenly realized that he was still there.\n\u201cUh,\u201d said Derek. He resisted the urge to rub the back of his neck. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d\nMr. Stilinski grinned, getting to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m famous or anything, but this definitely isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been recognized. Though it\u2019s usually by women\u2014which is weird, since I meant for Daddy Do\u2019s to be for, y\u2019know, dads, but maybe they\u2019re just embarrassed? Which I\u2019ve always thought was dumb, because a) there is nothing emasculating about braiding hair, and two, if you\u2019re more worried about your image than making your daughter happy\u2014\u201d\nErica tugged subtly on Mr. Stilinski\u2019s hand, and he cut himself off.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cUh. Sorry. I ramble when I\u2019m ner\u2014uh, yeah. Anyway. I\u2019m Stiles?\u201d\nIt was said like a question, so when Stiles held out a hand, Derek didn\u2019t immediately register it. By the time he processed the fact that Stiles wanted to shake hands, Stiles was letting out an awkward laugh and lowering his hand.\n\"No!\u201d said Derek, quickly grabbing Stiles\u2019 hand and shaking it, probably too hard. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not\u2014worried about my image.\u201d\n\u201cI can see why,\u201d Stiles said, and then went wide-eyed. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek said instantly.\nHe realized, abruptly, that he was still holding Stiles\u2019 hand, and dropped it.\n\"So, um,\u201d said Stiles, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his coat, \u201cis it just you and Lydia? Or is her mother also not hairishly-inclined?\u201d He winced. \u201cSorry, that, uh, sounded better in my head.\u201d\n\u201cJust us,\u201d Derek said, heart pounding.\nKate? What Kate?\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d said Stiles, face breaking into another huge grin. Videos had not done it justice. \u201cAs a fellow single father, I\u2019ve definitely got to help you out, then.\u201d\nSingle father?\n\"But\u2014\u201d Derek started, but realized too late that it would be weird to ask about the woman who was sometimes in his videos. What if she was Stiles\u2019 ex-wife? What if that was why Stiles had moved here?\nCrap.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 have to,\u201d Stiles said slowly, looking a bit crestfallen despite his obvious efforts not to.\n\u201cNo\u2014I mean, yes!\u201d Derek said hastily. \u201cYes, I\u2019d like you to help me out.\u201d\nAnother blinding smile. \u201cAwesome! Do you\u2014here, let me get my phone, we can work something out. Do you have texting? I\u2019m a huge fan of texting. Here, just\u2014\u201d\nHe held out his phone, and Derek awkwardly fumbled it before getting the keypad sorted out.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles said, when Derek handed the phone back.\n\u201cI have texting,\u201d Derek told him. \u201cSo\u2014that\u2019s fine. If you do that.\u201d\nLike magic, Lydia appeared at his side again, practically bouncing on the balls of her feet.\n\u201cThe bathrooms are in the other direction,\u201d said Erica.\nLydia gave her a filthy look.\n\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Derek said hastily, placing a hand on Lydia\u2019s back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll text you!\u201d Stiles promised, wiggling his cell phone.\nDerek tried to smile, but it felt like all of the muscles in his face had gone offline, so he thought it probably came out as something of a grimace. There was a weird buzzing throughout his body as he guided Lydia toward the doors to sign her out, like he was hooked up to a live wire. Halfway there, he tripped over absolutely nothing and almost knocked her over.\nHis ears burned.\nLydia waited until Derek was unlocking the car to speak up.\n\u201cYou like him,\u201d she said accusingly.\nDerek almost dropped the keys. Luckily, he recovered.\n\u201cI do like him,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHe seems like a nice guy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you like like him,\u201d Lydia informed him, climbing into the backseat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say that until you\u2019re at least eleven,\u201d Derek muttered, sliding into the driver\u2019s seat and turning the ignition.\n\u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\u201cSeatbelt?\u201d Derek asked, checking her in the rearview mirror even as Lydia replied with a longsuffering affirmation.\nA glance at the car\u2019s dashboard clock revealed that there was now no time to make dinner before Girl Scouts, which meant that Derek would have to fall back on the bag of oven-ready chicken nuggets in the freezer.\nHe eyed his daughter in the rearview mirror suspiciously.\nShe\u2019d probably planned that, too.\n\u00a0\n\nHey! It\u2019s Stiles!\n\nDerek waited an hour before he replied, then spent another twenty minutes trying to figure out what to say. He ended up sending a simple, Okay, and then cursed himself and sent another one that read, Are you going to pick Erica up tomorrow at the same time?\nYep! I\u2019ll see you then, and we can talk about getting together? Stiles texted back, almost instantly.\nYes, Derek replied, and then cursed himself some more.\n\u00a0\nThe following day, Derek made sure to arrive at Latchkey exactly on time, and sure enough Stiles was there. And no, his stomach did not flip at the sound of Stiles\u2019 laughter when he walked into the gym.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles said, waving him over to where he was sitting with Erica and Lydia on the bleachers.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Derek replied.\n\u201cWe\u2019re discussing Halloween costumes,\u201d Stiles told him.\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Derek asked, turning to Lydia. \u201cDid you make up your mind yet?\u201d\n\u201cA fairy princess demon witch,\u201d Lydia replied. \u201cWith nunchucks.\u201d\nCrap.\n\u201cNot a ladybug?\u201d Derek asked hopefully, because it had been her other choice. It was also the one that didn\u2019t require Derek to be dragged to seven different costume shops in order to acquire all the necessary props.\n\"Nope,\u201d Lydia said happily.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be Merida from the Brave movie,\u201d Erica informed him eagerly. \u201cI can even shoot real arrows, \u2018cause Aunt Allison got me my own bow before we came here.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, she did, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\nDerek knew the feeling.\nLaura had gotten Lydia some sort of child\u2019s science kit for Christmas, which mostly seemed to consist of different ways to make the world\u2019s least carpet-friendly slime. There were now strategically-placed rugs throughout the living room.\n\u201cSo I was thinking,\u201d Stiles said, as Lydia and Erica devolved into a discussion on their favorite parts of Brave. \u201cPicture day is on Friday, right? Erica brought home a three-inch stack of papers on Monday and I\u2019ve only worked through the first inch, but I think I remember the principal\u2019s secretary saying something while I was filling out paperwork last week? But I could be wrong, last week is kind of a blur of boxes and sweat and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on Friday,\u201d Derek confirmed.\nStiles let out a breath, looking relieved. \u201cThanks, man. Rambling is, like, my worst enemy. I\u2019ve got Erica trained up\u2014right, you saw her do it yesterday\u2014but just, like, jump in and interrupt if I ever get going.\u201d\n\u201cUh. Okay,\u201d Derek said, and then mentally kicked himself for sounding like a monosyllabic idiot. \u201cSo, picture day?\u201d\n\"Yeah!\u201d Stiles said, lighting up again. \u201cRight, so, I was thinking that we should maybe try to get together tonight? It\u2019s Wednesday, so that way if you\u2019re still struggling, we can try again tomorrow night too. Unless you\u2019re busy tonight, which I totally understand, or if you don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTonight is good,\u201d Derek said quickly.\u00a0\nStiles beamed. \u201cOh man, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve known me forever. Ramble averted, two for two.\u201d\nThat was definitely a stomach flip.\n\u201cI hate to put you on the spot or something, but our place is kind of a hot mess right now because we\u2019ve unpacked like three boxes and there was a mix-up with our utilities and we\u2019ve been showering at the neighbor\u2019s all week\u2014\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes went wide and he quickly changed tracks. \u201cUh. But. Anyway. Would you mind horribly if went to your place?\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Derek, and then remembered the strategically placed rugs, the Lydia-sized pink handprints painted on the leather couch, and the bleach stains on the front door.\nWhatever. At least they had running water.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you pretending to not know how to braid just so Mr. Stilinski has to come over?\u201d Lydia asked suspiciously, when they were in the car to go home.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said incredulously. \u201cWhere do you even get these ideas?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Lydia agreed, looking at him with eyes far too critical for a six-year-old. \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough at planning things to be doing that.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek replied faintly. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStiles called just as Derek was pulling the green beans off of the steamer.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said as soon as Derek picked up. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek said, abandoning the green beans in the sudden rush of nerves\u2014then remembering that they were done, and hastily pulling them up again. Crap. \u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t acted like this since he was sixteen.\n\"Great,\u201d said Stiles, and Derek suddenly realized that he sounded a little\u2026 tense. \u201cUm. Okay. I didn\u2019t want to do this in front of Erica, and I\u2019m sorry for springing this on you right now, but\u2014\u201d\nDerek felt a low, terrible swoop of dread in his stomach, and steeled himself for rejection.\n\u201cErica has epilepsy,\u201d Stiles said.\nDerek blinked.\nRelief flooded him for approximately five seconds, and then he realized what Stiles had said beyond the level of not cancelling, and immediately felt horrible.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d He fumbled for something to say and dumped the green beans into a bowl. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I know,\u201d Stiles said immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s not why I told you. It\u2019s just that there are some things that she isn\u2019t allowed to do or eat, and I wanted you to be prepared. Talking to Lydia about it would probably be a good idea, too.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Derek said instantly, moving away from the sink over to his laptop. \u201cWhat does she need?\u201d\n\u201cSo, uh, I don\u2019t know how much you know about epilepsy, but the first thing to know is that the whole flashing lights thing is super rare as a seizure trigger. There\u2019s, like, a whole list of things that can set people off. Erica\u2019s mostly triggered by sleep deprivation, hyperventilation, and if she eats anything with Red Dye 40, we think\u2014she was only diagnosed a year ago, so it\u2019s still kind of new.\u201d\nDerek tapped keys frantically with one hand, using abbreviations left, right and center.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little\u2026 overzealous when it comes to treatments,\u201d Stiles said, with a small, self-deprecating laugh that made Derek do something crazy like hug him until he stopped feeling like he should ever do that again. \u201cSo we cover all the bases. That means she\u2019s on a ketogenic diet\u2014no carbs, and nothing too high in table sugars. String cheese, most fruits as long as it\u2019s in small portions, seeds and nuts are all good, and she had a small dinner so we don\u2019t have to stress about calories tonight. No caffeine. Erica gets an hour of screen-time a week, to be used at her discretion, and she hasn\u2019t used any this week so that should be okay. Nothing too active, though, because if she gets out of breath\u2014\u201d\nDerek dutifully took notes until Stiles finally finished.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Derek said when Stiles went quiet, staring at the messy list on his computer. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible. That you do all that. I\u2014can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\nStiles blew out a breath. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not easy. But, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think of it as an achievement or anything. I hate it when people are like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re so strong\u2019 and shit like that, because\u2014she\u2019s my kid. It\u2019s not about being strong, it\u2019s just what I have to do. You know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles said, and there was that stupid, self-deprecating laugh again. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said quickly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that\u2014they thought Lydia had Down Syndrome. She tested positive in utero. Kate\u2014her mother\u2014wanted an abortion, but I didn\u2019t. We broke up over it. She didn\u2019t end up\u2026\u201d He trailed off and swallowed. \u201cShe\u2019s not a part of Lydia\u2019s life. Either of our lives.\u201d\nStiles was quiet.\n\u201cSorry, I know it\u2019s not the same\u2014\u201d Derek started, suddenly feeling like an ass, when Stiles cut him off.\n\u201cNo! No, no,\u201d Stiles said hastily. \u201cI was just processing. I\u2019m sorry about her mom flaking on you. That must have been rough.\u201d\nDerek shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re better off without her.\u201d\nHe wondered what had happened to Erica\u2019s mother. Was she the woman in the videos? Did she live here in Albany? Was Stiles still in love with her?\nBut Stiles offered no information. Instead he just said, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\"Daddy, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d Lydia announced, walking into the kitchen. She narrowed her eyes at Derek. \u201cWho\u2019s on the phone?\u201d\nDerek ignored her, because they\u2019d had the conversation about Lydia interrupting him on the phone at least a thousand times already.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Derek promised. \u201cOver dinner. Which she\u2019s now demanding.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well then,\u201d Stiles laughed. \u201cFar be it from me to get between a child and their dinner. Thanks so much, Derek, I really appreciate this. I\u2019ll see you soon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Derek, and then listened to Stiles hang up before he hit END.\n\u201cYou like him,\u201d Lydia declared, hands on her hips.\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Derek replied, handing her the bowl of beans. \u201cPut this on the table, and then get the silverware, okay? We have some things to talk about before Mr. Stilinski and Erica get here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nWhat are Lydia\u2019s feelings on Barbie dolls?\n\nMostly that she doesn\u2019t have enough, Derek replied, and felt inordinately proud of himself for a whole minute for being witty before he began to wonder if that made Lydia sound too much like a brat.\n\u00a0\nThe evening was not a complete disaster.\nStiles and Erica arrived, and there was no visible judgment passed on the bleach-stained door, or on the pink handprints Derek hadn\u2019t quite managed to cover up with pillows. Lydia did not throw any temper tantrums, and played agreeably on the floor of the living room with Erica\u2014though Derek did notice that she kept an eye on Erica\u2019s mermaid Barbie all night. He really, really hoped that this was because she wanted one too, not because she wanted to tack \u2018mermaid\u2019 on to the end of her already ridiculous Halloween costume.\nThere were no seizures or snack mishaps, and luckily, unlike the neighbor boy Jackson who was the same age as Lydia, Erica did not have a propensity for falling in toilets (don\u2019t ask). Stiles had even brought some string thing for Derek to learn on, so he wouldn\u2019t have to abuse Lydia\u2019s scalp any more than necessary.\n(Lydia was initially disappointed about that; in preparation for Stiles\u2019 visit, she had laid out on the coffee table what was quite possibly every single hair-related item they had in the apartment, including Derek\u2019s razor and multiple bottles of Strawberry Smoothie L\u2019Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo. She quickly got over it when she saw Erica\u2019s mermaid Barbie, though.)\nSo it was all going well, with no imminent disasters on the horizon, until they actually sat down to do the braiding bit\u2014which was when it became readily apparent that Derek had not thought through this idea at all.\n\u00a0\nThe string thing was a square of white fabric about a foot wide, with rows of red and yellow strings affixed to it in two columns that were an inch apart. Stiles swore it was an unpatented miracle worker.\n\u201cI made this to teach my friend Scott how to French braid,\u201d he told Derek, as Derek tried to decide whether to keep holding it or set it on his lap. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of sickeningly in love with his wife and wanted to learn as some kind of present to her? I really don\u2019t understand it because Allison knows perfectly well how to braid her own hair, but whatever. I don\u2019t even ask with them, anymore.\u201d\n\u201cAllison, as in bow-and-arrow Allison?\u201d Derek asked.\n\u201cNone other,\u201d Stiles confirmed. \u201cYou might have seen her\u2014I use her as a model for my more adult hairstyles on my channel. I mean, probably not. You seem like you\u2019re kind of stuck on the whole basic braiding thing, so there wouldn\u2019t be much point in watching more complicated hairstyles, right? It\u2019s not like\u2014anyway. Uh. Yeah.\u201d\nDerek didn\u2019t know how to tell Stiles that actually, he\u2019d probably watched every video on his channel at least three times without sounding like a creeper.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Stiles, with a look like he was sizing Derek up. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 get started?\u201d\nDerek nodded.\nAnd it was fine for the first minute or so, where Derek began muddling through the strings by himself. He\u2019d practically memorized the audio from Stiles\u2019 video tutorial. But then\u2014\nThen\u2014\n\u201cOh, no, no, no,\u201d said Stiles, reaching over and grabbing Derek\u2019s hands.\n\nGrabbing Derek\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThis is where you\u2019re going wrong,\u201d Stiles told him, wrapping his hands around Derek\u2019s. \u201cHere. You want to take the red bunch here, and hold it like this, between\u2014yeah, like that. And then you\u2019re free to add hair\u2014or, well, string\u2014from the right side, see?\u201d\nDerek nodding, trying very, very hard to look at the string and not at the hands that were covering his own.\nJesus, those fingers.\nThey were exactly as warm and soft as he\u2019d imagined they\u2019d be. Long. God, so long. Pale, contrasting with Derek\u2019s more olive-toned skin beautifully. And though Stiles wasn\u2019t gripping him very hard, the pressure and the heat and the weight of Stiles\u2019 hands on his own felt incredible, intimate, made him wonder about the way that they might feel\u2014\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles asked. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s ears flamed, and his stomach twisted with sudden shame.\nShit.\nHere was Stiles, the single father of a child with a disability, possibly recently divorced, going out of his way to help Derek be a better dad, and what was Derek doing? Sitting here like an asshole and objectifying him. Fantasizing about his hands.\n(But, Jesus, those hands, seriously\u2014)\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek said, inhaling and using guilt to make himself focus on actually braiding. He valiantly attempted to figure out where Stiles had been pushing his fingers moments ago. \u201cSo, uh\u2014like\u2026 this\u2026?\u201d\nHe twisted the bundles of strings in his hands awkwardly, right over left, and that was weird. Bad. His hands felt wrong, without a trace of the surety that they had when doing a normal, three-stranded braid.\nHe glanced at Stiles, feeling like an idiot.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said Stiles, and Derek barely noticed the hands sliding away from his own as a brilliant smile lit up Stiles\u2019 entire face. Warmth pooled in his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019ve totally got this,\u201d Stiles said encouragingly. \u201cDo it again.\u201d\nDerek had no idea what he\u2019d just done.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he said, and pulled the next section of strings between random fingers.\n\u201cOther one,\u201d Stiles hinted.\nOther what?\u201d\nDerek moved the new chunk of strings to two new fingers.\n\u201cYeah, ah\u2026 Here,\u201d said Stiles, pressing his body right up against Derek\u2019s to get the right angle as he grabbed Derek\u2019s hands again. \u201cLet\u2019s go through a few stitches together, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said faintly.\nHe really, really hadn\u2019t thought this through.\nAnd then Stiles was literally manhandling his fingers, pressing and pulling and tugging, and Derek focused on keeping his breathing even. Stiles\u2019 fingers were like magic, working Derek\u2019s to create a perfect French braid down the piece of fabric. And the weight of his body against Derek\u2019s\u2014\n\u201cSo how did you learn to do this?\u201d Derek blurted out.\n\u201cWhat, braid hair?\u201d Stiles asked.\nDerek nodded. \u201cYeah. Did you\u2014do you do this for a living?\u201d\nStiles grinned. \u201cNo. That would have been awesome\u2014playing with hair and having someone stuck in a chair, forced to listen to me talk for hours on end? Sign me up, yo. But, no, I work for a company contracted by the Navy. In an office. Nothing dangerous or anything. Basically, it\u2019s my job to sit around and plan out hypothetical responses to crises the Navy think might happen.\u201d\n\u201cSo where did braiding come from?\u201d Derek asked, while privately wondering exactly how smart you had to be to land that sort of job.\nNow Stiles looked sheepish. \u201cHonestly? YouTube. Erica was practically bald until she was three, so when she finally lost the dandelion look I decided to learn braiding to celebrate, and\u2026 yeah. Here we are. Plus, once you\u2019ve got the basics down, it\u2019s pretty easy to just start inventing. Pinterest is a treasure trove of inspiration. Plus, my mom had a little side business doing prom hair when I was little, so I have a lot of her old magazines and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t go to her to learn?\u201d Derek asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cNo, she actually died when I was a teenager,\u201d Stiles said, making a face.\nDerek\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Stiles interrupted, flapping a hand at him dismissively. \u201cI\u2019ve had, like, more than a decade to get used to it. I mean, not used to it, because you really don\u2019t ever get used to it, but you know. S\u2019cool. What about you, huh? Mom, aunts, sisters\u2026 you too embarrassed to ask them for help?\u201d\n\"They don\u2019t live around here,\u201d Derek replied. \u201cBut Laura\u2014my sister\u2014has been getting a real kick out it. Every time I call her, she asks for an update on my \u2018hairy situation\u2019.\u201d\nStiles laughed. \u201cYeah, well, next time, maybe you can tell her that you\u2019ve got the hairy situation completely untangled, so she can get out of your hair about it already?\u201d\nDerek groaned. \u201cYou two should never, ever meet.\u201d\n\u201cWould it be punfortunate?\u201d Stiles asked, smirking.\n\u201cYou are officially banned from speaking,\u201d Derek replied. \u201cEspecially to Laura.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever, man. Everyone loves puns. Don\u2019t even try to front with me. Now let\u2019s see you braid those strings again.\u201d\nDerek stared at the perfectly-done French braid that Stiles had somehow manipulated out of Derek\u2019s fingers, and slowly, with great reluctance, began to undo it.\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the night, Derek had graduated from the string thing to actual hair. He finally ended up with an uneven, lumpy French braid that was missing a chunk on the right side, braided all the way down to the bottom of Lydia\u2019s hair with bits sticking out, and tied off with a fuzzy pink hair tie.\nDerek wanted to rip it out and never look at it again.\nLydia nearly dropped the mirror she was holding when she lined it up with the bathroom mirror to get a look at her hair.\n\u201cI HAVE PRINCESS HAIR!\u201d she shrieked, and practically leapt at Derek, crushing him in a hug with her tiny, bony limbs. \u201cYou\u2019re the best daddy ever.\u201d\n\u201cYou look beautiful, Lydia,\u201d Stiles told her, grinning widely.\nDerek stared at him incredulously.\n\u201cCan we take a picture? You have to take a picture, Daddy,\u201d Lydia instructed, wriggling out of Derek\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019m gonna wear my tiara and my princess dress and my wand, and you can put it on your Facebook so Aunt Laura and Grandma and Grandpa can see, and I can be a real princess for Halloween now, and\u2026\u201d\nHer voice disappeared down the hall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hideous,\u201d Derek said to Stiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Stiles corrected, looking like he absolutely, completely believed it.\nDerek\u2019s stomach flip-flopped, and he was fairly certain his ears were burning. Again.\n\u00a0\nThey decided that since Derek had the basics down, Erica had a doctor\u2019s appointment right after school and Lydia had dance class the following evening, that Derek would just practice on his own from there on out.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d Stiles told Derek confidently, as Erica finished putting her Barbies back into her Dora the Explorer satchel.\nDerek looked at Lydia\u2019s crooked braid that was literally falling apart with every step she took, and then looked back at Stiles doubtfully.\n\u201cI have faith in you,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI\u2019ll even leave you the Stringamajig.\u201d\nDerek blinked. \u201cThe what?\u201d\n\"The Stringamajig\u2014it\u2019s what I call the string thing. It\u2019s like thingamajig, but with string, get it?\u201d Stiles beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\nNever, ever, ever meeting Laura.\n\u00a0\n\nLydia\u2019s \u2018princess hair\u2019. She cried when I made her take it out for her bath.\n\nLaura Hale, BenandTalia Hale and 5 others like this.\nLaura Hale Derek! I\u2019m so proud! I take it you finally found someone to help you?\nBenandTalia Hale wow she\u2019s getting so big derek!!! so beautiful. when are you coming home? we miss you!!\nIsaac Lahey Not bad, bro. Is this from last night, with the dude you have a crush on?\nLaura Hale WHAT CRUSH. DEREK.\nDerek Hale Nothing. Isaac\u2019s making things up.\nIsaac Lahey That\u2019s just what Lydia told me when I dropped her and Jackson off at school this morning\u2026\nLaura Hale I\u2019m calling tomorrow night, Derek, and you\u2019d better answer.\n\u00a0\nThe following day, Derek picked Lydia up from Latchkey and found himself looking around for Stiles before he remembered that he\u2019d picked Erica up right after school for her doctor\u2019s appointment. He wondered just how much school Erica missed for her epilepsy. It had to be hard for her and for Stiles, especially since it sounded like Erica saw doctors pretty often.\n\u201cDaddy!\u201d Lydia called, skipping over to him and abandoning her clapping game with Jackson.\nJackson burst into tears.\nLydia was happily oblivious.\n\u201cDaddy, Daddy, guess what?\u201d she demanded, grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the gym. \u201cErica doesn\u2019t have a mommy either. I asked.\u201d\nDerek stopped walking. \u201cYou what?\u201d\n\u201cI asked,\u201d Lydia repeated obviously. She turned around and tugged on his hand impatiently. \u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLydia, you can\u2019t ask people questions like that,\u201d Derek groaned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a bad question, Daddy,\u201d Lydia informed him, rather righteously.\n\u201cYes, there is,\u201d Derek told her. \u201cQuestions like that are rude.\u201d\nLydia glared. \u201cShe answered.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t ask people questions like that, Lydia. It\u2019s not nice. Do you understand?\u201d\nLydia looked like she would rather stomp her foot and say no, but instead she replied with a somewhat mutinous, \u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Derek said, and started walking again.\nIt was quiet as he signed her out and walked down the hallway.\n\"Erica says her daddy bought her,\u201d Lydia piped up, as Derek pushed open the door to the parking lot. \u201cShe says he saved money for lots of years, and then he bought her, and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t have a mommy.\u201d\nDerek sighed. \u201cSomehow, I think Erica\u2019s missing a few details.\u201d\n\u201cErica says she thinks her daddy likes you, too,\u201d Lydia added pointedly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Lydia,\u201d Derek said firmly.\n\u201cShe says\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLydia,\u201d Derek interrupted.\nLydia huffed, but went quiet.\n\u00a0\nLaura called him, but Derek silenced his phone and texted back, in Lydia\u2019s dance class, call you back later.\nHe didn\u2019t.\nHe was busy braiding and rebraiding Lydia\u2019s hair, trying to get it to look even half as good as the ones that Stiles seemed to do without any effort at all. After Lydia sat through the entirety of The Little Mermaid, though, her patience was tried and Derek was forced to stop for the night.\nIt was fine, he told himself. It wasn\u2019t like they were going to photograph the back of her head tomorrow.\nStiles would see it, though.\n\u00a0\nLydia waited until after her bedtime story, kiss on the forehead, smoothing of the covers, and the flipping off of her bedroom light, to speak up.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d she said.\nDerek turned around and saw that she had sat back up in bed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou really like Mr. S, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\nDerek sighed, and held in a groan.\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he said, because there was really no denying that he had a massive crush on the man at this point. Especially to Lydia. Lydia was to lies as sharks were to blood in the water.\n\u201cI like him, too,\u201d Lydia said, very serious. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t like him just because you think I need a mommy.\u201d\nDerek blinked, feeling like he\u2019d been punched in the chest.\n\u201cI\u2014Lydia, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you like him \u2018cause he makes you happy?\u201d Lydia asked.\nDerek inhaled. \u201cYes. Yes, that\u2019s why I like him.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lydia said, and laid back down to go to sleep. \u201cNight, Daddy.\u201d\n\u201cGood night,\u201d Derek answered, automatically. \u201cDon\u2019t let the bed bugs bite.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if they bite, bite \u2018em back,\u201d Lydia mumbled in reply, already drifting off.\n\u00a0\nPicture day dawned\u2026 grey and wet. Derek had numerous text messages on his phone from Laura, informing him that she was expecting a phone call tonight, and there would be trouble if he ignored her for a second time.\nHe spent nearly thirty minutes fussing over Lydia\u2019s hair, going so far as to stand behind her as she ate her breakfast, trying one last time to get her braid to be as perfect as possible. Lydia did a lot of eye-rolling, convinced that every braid that Derek did was perfect and there was no need to start over again, but patiently endured it.\nThe end result was decent. It was nowhere near as good as Stiles\u2019, and Derek knew that he\u2019d done one or two that had been better last night, but they couldn\u2019t delay any longer or they\u2019d be late.\nAt the drop-off line at school, Lydia waited until Jackson had already run inside to unbuckle herself. She scrambled to her knees and tumbled forward, wrapping skinny arms around Derek\u2019s neck.\n\u201cThank you for the princess hair, Daddy,\u201d she said, and planted a wet kiss on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Derek with a bemused grin, turning around to watch her put on her backpack and pull the hood of her raincoat up.\n\u201cLove you,\u201d Lydia said, hand on the door.\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d Derek replied, as she threw open the door and sprinted for the school. \u201cAnd don\u2019t make Jackson cry today!\u201d\n\u00a0\nDerek arrived at Latchkey ten minutes late, dripping wet and out of breath because he\u2019d been worried that Stiles would have left with Erica before he got there. Luckily, that was not the case, and Stiles was listening to Lydia rant about something when Derek walked in the door.\n\"Daddy!\u201d Lydia said shrilly, turning to face him. \u201cLook what stupid Jackson did!\u201d\nShe thrust the hem of her dress forward, displaying a large pink stain.\nDerek suspected that Lydia had not, then, made it through the day without making Jackson cry. Oh, good.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call people stupid, Lydia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice. Was it an accident?\u201d\nLydia folded her arms over her chest. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say sorry?\u201d\n\u201cOnly \u2018cause I made him.\u201d\nDerek held in a sigh.\n\u201cI was just telling Lydia that I\u2019m sure that the stain will come out in the wash,\u201d Stiles put in, rising to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some pretty awesome stain-remover at home, if you need it.\u201d\n\"We\u2019ve got some, too,\u201d Derek assured him. \u201cBut thanks. And thanks for staying with her\u2014I was running late at work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no problem. What is it you do, anyway?\u201d Stiles asked.\n\u201cNothing really exciting,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI inspect companies for EPA violations.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Stiles, looking impressed. \u201cYou are\u2026 not the kind of person I pictured doing that type of thing.\u201d\n\u201cPhysically intimidating was literally written in the job requirements,\u201d Derek told him. \u201cApparently, we\u2019re less likely to be bribed that way.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cHas anyone ever tried to bribe you?\u201d\nDerek grinned. \u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cWell. Solid theory, then,\u201d Stiles said, eyebrows raised.\nDerek nodded, and looked down to find Lydia missing. He panicked for the half a second it took for him to look to the left, and find that she was playing some sort of clapping game with Jackson and Erica. He also noted with some relief that Erica\u2019s hair was not done in any fancy, overly-complicated style, but simple pigtails with ribbons.\n\u201cLydia\u2019s hair looks really great,\u201d Stiles commented, drawing Derek\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cYou did an awesome job.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Derek, casual-like.\nCool. Suave.\nThat was Derek.\n\u201cOh, and before I forgot,\u201d Stiles said, \u201cI, uh, I wanted to clarify. Erica told me that she and Lydia were talking about their mothers yesterday, and apparently Erica took my explanation of her birth a little\u2026 capitalistically?\u201d\nOh.\n\u201cLydia mentioned it,\u201d Derek said, even more casually, like he wasn\u2019t desperate to hear about Erica\u2019s mother.\nStiles laughed, looking a little embarrassed. \u201cI guess I just wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t think I stole her or something. You know? Anyway. What happened was I sort of did buy her. Or, well, I paid an arm and a leg to have a surrogate carry her for me. I\u2019d always wanted to be a dad, and the chances of a young, single, mostly-gay dude who lived alone acquiring a kid are, like, slim to none\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek said, only half registering his words. His brain was still stuck on single and mostly-gay.\nStiles broke off, looking relieved. \u201cRight. Anyway. Trying to explain all of that to a five-year-old is a complete nightmare, and I apologize for whatever butchered version Lydia came home with yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Derek said, staring at Stiles.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles said, blushing slightly. \u201cI know it\u2019s a really obnoxious story to tell to parents who aren\u2019t single parents by choice.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, eyes widening. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t\u2014just\u2014it\u2019s only you and Erica, then?\u201d\nStiles grinned. \u201cYep, it\u2019s just us. Well, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of help from my dad, and Scott and Allison, but they\u2019re all back in Michigan. We moved here because there\u2019s a really great epilepsy center, with lots of trials and pediatric experts and stuff. Kind of sucks, losing the support system, and I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about Daddy Do\u2019s since Scott was my cameraman. I guess we could go to a stationary camera for a while? Get a tripod or something? We\u2019ve got a backlog filmed, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI could do it,\u201d Derek blurted out.\nStiles shook his head. \u201cOh, no, I wasn\u2019t saying that so that you\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I want to,\u201d Derek said, heart hammering. \u201cI do. I want to help.\u201d\nStiles stared at Derek with a hesitant smile on his face. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Derek. \u201cJust call. Text. Whatever. Whenever. Not whenever, actually, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sunday nights are bad, but other than that, whenever.\u201d\nHis ears were burning again. He just knew it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014awesome,\u201d Stiles said, face breaking out in another blinding smile. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014yeah. Thank you! So much.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Derek, grinning stupidly right back.\n\u201cWould you\u2026 um. Well, we usually film Saturday mornings. You could\u2014I mean, you and Lydia, obviously\u2014you guys could stay for lunch?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek said immediately. \u201cSaturdays are great. We don\u2019t do anything. That sounds great.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles said, slightly wide-eyed, still beaming. \u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said, with a terrible, distant feeling that his face was much the same way. \u201cI\u2019ll. Text you.\u201d\nStiles nodded.\n\u201cTime to go!\u201d Lydia announced, magically appearing at Derek\u2019s side with Erica in tow. She grabbed Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cBye, Erica, bye, Mr. S!\u201d\n\u201cBye, Lydia!\u201d Stiles called, as Lydia all but dragged Derek away.\nDerek let himself be led away, every inch of his skin tingling, his head buzzing. He signed Lydia out practically on autopilot.\n\u201cI knew you liked him,\u201d Lydia said, as they walked down the hallway. \u201cI told you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Derek agreed.\n\u201cYou should listen to me more often,\u201d Lydia informed him, tossing her braid over her shoulder.\nDerek grinned, slowed so that he was a step behind her, and grabbed her around the middle to lift her up and flip her upside down. Ignoring her shrieking laughter, he grabbed an ankle in each hand, and proceeded to let her dangle all the way out to the car.\u00a0"
