    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s middle name is known in canon to start with \u2018P\u2019, but no one knows what it is. I chose Philip, partly it\u2019s a fun name and partly because of Saint Philip Neri. St. Philip is known as the patron saint of joy, humor, and Special Forces. Matt most definitely counts as a special force.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, Matt gets pretty active at the end of this story. He should probably be lying completely still and knocked out on pain meds, but he's Matt Effing Murdock and he can do what he wants. He seems pretty good at grinning and bearing it anyway, and Foggy offers a lot of grinning potential. And I feel like Matt knows how to move carefully so that he doesn't hurt himself more (he's had a lot of practice), and Foggy will probably be mother henning him the whole time, no matter how into it he gets. But if that bothers you (which I would totally understand), you can either: pretend the end takes place after a time skip, where Matt's healed; or, pretend Matt has a healing factor. I sort of think he does, sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also also, Matt\u2019s Mark is a tramp stamp. I don\u2019t know why this amused me so much, but it really, really did.</p>",
    "text": "Franklin Philip Nelson is born with a bright smile and the word Devil burned over his heart.\n\u00a0\nHis parents are worried, naturally. They consult with several specialists, who all assure them that Franklin is a happy, healthy baby boy. They consult with several spiritual advisors, who also assure him that Franklin is a happy, healthy baby boy. They check birth records to see if some young couple has chosen an avant-garde name for their baby, but find nothing. They consider the fact that their son might become a Satanist.\n\u00a0\nFinally, Mr. And Mrs. Nelson decide that their son is a happy, healthy baby boy, and that they will love him no matter what.\n\u00a0\nEven if he does become a Satanist.\n\u00a0\nFranklin Philip Nelson does not become a Satanist. In fact, he has very little interest in religion at all. His parents take him to church every week until he is six, just in case he needs some mental reinforcement that God is good, God is great. Franklin hums under his breath and kicks the pews and pays very little attention to the droning voice of the pastor.\u00a0One day Mr. And Mrs. Nelson are called into the principal\u2019s office at Sunnyside School and told that their son punched Jamie Sampson. Franklin explains earnestly that Jamie was bullying Julia, and that he doesn\u2019t like bullies and he\u2019s going to be a professional bully-puncher when he grows up so that girls like Julia won\u2019t cry anymore.\n\u00a0\nMr. and Mrs. Nelson decide that the Devil would be lucky to have someone like Franklin as a soulmate, even if they very much hope He doesn\u2019t exist.\n\u00a0\nFranklin\u2014who at age seven decides that \u201cFoggy\u201d is a much cooler name because he doesn\u2019t get sunburn on foggy days, and that makes them awesome\u2014goes on to become a very normal, agnostic boy. He is a little smarter than his classmates and a little louder, but everyone agrees that he is, over all, a friendly and precocious boy who punches bullies.\n\u00a0\nFoggy does not worry as much as his parents do about his Mark. After all, he is one hundred percent (ish) certain that the Devil, proper noun, does not exist. This means that his soulmate must just be someone who has a weird, kind of cool name.\n\u00a0\nOr maybe they\u2019re really religious or something, which isn\u2019t really Foggy\u2019s thing but as long as they\u2019re not a zealot nutjob, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u00a0Or maybe they\u2019ve got a devilish goatee or something, or they\u2019re a star player for the New Jersey Devils. There are lots of options, and Foggy figures he\u2019ll just sort of roll with it. After all, the \u2018Devil\u2019 is Foggy\u2019s soulmate. They\u2019re meant to be together. Foggy will figure out the details when he gets there.\n\u00a0\nFoggy meets Matt Murdock on the first day of law school. His first thought is \u2018hot\u2019. His second thought is \u2018blind\u2019. His third thought is \u2018wow, hot\u2019. \n\u00a0\nAnd the thing is, Matt\u2019s not just super-hot. He\u2019s also funny and dorky and disarmingly shy sometimes, and he laughs at Foggy\u2019s dumb jokes and gets crinkles around his eyes when he smiles really wide, and they split the blueberry muffins they get from the cafeteria because Matt only likes the bottoms and Foggy only likes the tops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Together, they make a whole, unified muffin. That\u2019s got to be fate.\n\u00a0\nMatt shows no devilish tendencies in their three years as roommates. In fact, much to Foggy\u2019s consternation, the guy\u2019s a saint. He talks earnestly to Foggy about the wonders of justice and fighting for what\u2019s right, and he brings Foggy food when he forgets to eat, and he does their laundry when it\u2019s his turn and uses the expensive detergent that he buys himself (Foggy later realizes that Matt uses the detergent because it is unscented and doesn\u2019t make his nose itch, after which Foggy also buys the expensive detergent and weeps silently over the sad state of his wallet). The only vaguely devilish tendency Matt presents is that he punches bullies, and obviously Foggy\u2019s pretty on board with that.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the whole saint thing, there are three major problems standing in the way of Foggy\u2019s plan to seduce Matt to the dark side and ride off into the sunset with him.\n\u00a0\nOne: Matt is extremely Catholic. Actually, this presents several smaller problems in and of itself, mostly consisting of:\n\u00a0\nOne-A: Catholics tend to be not so much into the gay thing. Sure, Matt seems totally okay with it when Foggy tells him faux-casually that he likes dicks as well as chicks, but there\u2019s a big difference between being cool about the gayness in others and embracing the gayness in yourself.\n\u00a0\nOne-B: Catholics tend to be not so much into the Devil thing. That one seems pretty nonnegotiable.\n\u00a0\nTwo: Matt shows no innate gayness within himself to embrace, even if he wanted to. Matt has game for a dork, and even though he\u2019s blind he always seems to find the pretty girls. Pretty girls, never pretty boys. Foggy floats several comments about the massive hotness of young Harrison Ford and other celebrities old enough for Matt to remember seeing, but Matt just hums absently and asks Foggy to test him on the precursors to the Miranda Rights. And honestly, if Matt\u2019s not impressed by young Harrison Ford, the guy doesn\u2019t have a gay bone in his body.\n\u00a0\nThree, and most importantly: Matt does not have a Mark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt used to bother me.\u201d Matt confides to him one night as they huddle up in a blanket fort between their bunks and pretend they don\u2019t have finals tomorrow. \u201cBut now, I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Foggy agrees faintly, heart dropping to reside somewhere near his slippered feet.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re not supposed to talk about Marks. It\u2019s a rule that no one says and everyone understands. It\u2019s taboo. You only bring it up if you genuinely think that the person you\u2019re talking to is, well, it.\u00a0 The real deal, the yin to your yang, the peanut butter to your jelly.\u00a0But Foggy supposes that rule doesn\u2019t apply to Matt. There are people out there, sure, who are born without Marks. Some of them make themselves miserable over it, and others shrug it off and find something else to make them happy. Matt is clearly of the latter variety, and Foggy\u2019s thrilled that Matt\u2019s not miserable, but. No Mark.\n\u00a0\nMatt doesn\u2019t ask Foggy about his, which might be the reason Foggy tells him. Matt gives him his deepest secret, and asks for nothing in return. Matt\u2019s a freaking saint, and Foggy wants\u2014needs\u2014to give Matt something back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy soulmate might be Satan.\u201d He blurts out. When Matt blinks at him blankly, Foggy explains.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re a devil in the sack?\u201d Matt offers thoughtfully when Foggy's done with the nitty-gritty details, and Foggy laughs until he cries.\n\u00a0\nHe decides, when he wakes up and finds Matt sprawled out on top of him in the blanket fort, drooling on Foggy\u2019s shoulder and muttering something in his sleep about avocados, that he doesn\u2019t give a fuck who the Devil is. He doesn\u2019t give a fuck that Matt doesn\u2019t have a convenient Mark on his skin promising that he\u2019s Foggy\u2019s, just Foggy\u2019s and no one else\u2019s. Matt Murdock is the love of his fucking life, and the world and the Devil can deal with it.\n\u00a0\nMatt grumbles and rolls a little to the left so that he can drool on Foggy\u2019s other shoulder. Foggy wraps an arm around Matt\u2019s waist and goes back to sleep.\n\u00a0\nMatt may not be the Devil, but he\u2019s just about everything else.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFoggy deals.\n\u00a0\nHe meets Marci and has a lot of hot, dirty sex. They both know they\u2019re not each other\u2019s soulmate, and they\u2019re both cool with it. Matt doesn't like Marci very much, Foggy can tell, but he\u2019s painfully polite to her anyway and Marci generally ignores him in favor of dragging Foggy off for more hot, dirty sex. It works.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t cry when Matt comes back to the dorm late, hair mussed and clothes sex-rumpled. He maybe sniffles a little, but he\u2019s got allergies, okay?\n\u00a0\nHe teaches himself Braille, although he doesn\u2019t tell Matt. Foggy doesn\u2019t want to disappoint him, because the only language Foggy\u2019s ever been good at is Punjabi, and trying to learn an entirely new system of writing on top of that without tipping Matt off about Foggy's embarrassing undertaking. \u00a0He tries though. Oh, he tries. He studies every moment that he has to himself, mostly when Matt\u2019s out doing things Foggy doesn\u2019t want to think about and Foggy\u2019s dealing with sudden, severe bouts of mysterious allergies.\n\u00a0\nHe practices Braille more than he practices Punjabi, which is monumentally stupid because he\u2019s not getting credit for Braille. When he steals Matt\u2019s textbook while he\u2019s quizzing him and starts reading off the statistics without pause, Matt tackles him and whispers \u2018thank you, thank you, thank you\u2019 into his hair until Foggy\u2019s love-struck jelly in his arms. Totally worth it, Foggy thinks when he barely scrapes a pass in his Punjabi class and slips from magna cum laude into just plain cum laude.\n\u00a0\nThey graduate. Foggy almost sells his soul to Landman and Zack before Matt comes to him, looking shaky but determined, and says he\u2019s leaving the company. Foggy follows, of course Foggy follows. There was never any question.\n\u00a0\nThey get their own crummy office, and they\u2019re poor as dirt and happy as clams. Karen shows up, and she\u2019s such a nice person that Foggy only feels a little sick when it turns out she has the hots for Matt. Everyone has the hots for Matt, he reminds himself, and just because Karen is badass and pretty and wonderful does not mean that Matt\u2019s automatically going to fall in love with her. Karen\u2019s got a cute little wristband hiding a Mark on her left arm, and that means that she\u2019s not meant for Matt, not at all. Right?\n\u00a0\nMatt, as far as Foggy knows, does not fall in love with Karen. He appears to like her as much as Foggy does, but he never blushes or stutters around her, and when they go out together Matt tucks his hand into Foggy\u2019s elbow every time and lets Foggy lead him.\n\u00a0\nEvery time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bombs go off. Hell\u2019s Kitchen burns.\n\u00a0\nFoggy wakes up sometime during the night and feels someone watching him in his hospital bed. Probably that should be freaky as hell, but he recognizes the prickle on his skin and the quiet rustle of clothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt?\u201d He whispers, voice sleep-rough, and after a moment Matt shuffles sheepishly forward. The hospital room is pretty dark, so all Foggy can see is the shadowy idea of Matt\u2019s face. He supposes that darkness doesn\u2019t matter very much to Matt Murdock.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKaren said you were hurt.\u201d Matt says quietly. His voice sounds kind of weird, like he\u2019s talking through water\u2014thick and slow and not quite right. Foggy blinks a little, trying to will the sleep from his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMm, yeah, a little.\u201d Foggy nods, head heavy. He shakes it once or twice to clear his thoughts, and gradually remembers the details leading to his arrival here at the hospital. Matt, complete radio silence, Foggy sure that he\u2019d wandered off and fallen down a manhole. \u201cTried to call.\u201d He tells Matt pointedly. \u201cThought you might be hurt too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Matt says, voice even odder. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201c He stops, and Foggy hears him take a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I took so long. I should have been here sooner.\u201d He sounds so completely ashamed that Foggy only stays a tiny bit mad.\n\u00a0\nThere are no chairs around, the nurses taking them to discourage visitors off-hours, but they obviously hadn\u2019t planned for Matt. No one expects the Murdock Inquisition. Matt does an awkward, unsure little shift like he\u2019s not quite sure where his feet should go. He looks awful, Foggy thinks. Hair all over the place, pale as a ghost and more than a little shell-shocked. He\u2019s not wearing his glasses, and his hazel eyes are shadow-rimmed and wild. Foggy takes pity on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mere, Matt.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy pats the bed next to him, inviting Matt to take a seat so that he can be more comfortable. Matt shuffles forward, but instead of settling on the edge of the bed like Foggy had expected, Matt gingerly climbs into the bed next to Foggy, wraps his arms around him, and buries his face in Foggy\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay there, buddy?\u201d Foggy asks cautiously, because this does not seem to be classic Matt behavior. Matt\u2019s face is nestled the exact same place it was in the blanket fort, years ago. It\u2019s like his body remembers where to go.\n\u00a0\nMatt doesn\u2019t say anything, just takes a long shuddering breath and refuses to move.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Matt?\u201d Matt shudders again. \u201cCome on, Matty. We\u2019re all okay. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got the calls.\u201d Matt tells him, choked. \u201cI checked my phone\u2014finally, ha, should have checked sooner\u2014and there are a dozen messages, all you and Karen sounding terrified. And then Karen starts talking about you being in the hospital, being hurt, but she doesn\u2019t say how and it was hours ago, Foggy. For all I knew, you could have been dead and I wouldn\u2019t have known because I didn\u2019t check my phone.\u201d \n\u00a0\nHis breath brushes over the sensitive column of Foggy\u2019s throat and Foggy suddenly remembers why cuddling Matt is not so good for his mental health. No one should be able to hit all of Foggy\u2019s hot buttons with a hug, even a horizontal one. He always feels incredibly guilty, because Matt\u2019s just looking for some simple comfort, and Foggy\u2019s messy feelings are not what Matt needs, now or ever.\n\u00a0\nFortunately, Foggy\u2019s very good at hiding the messy feelings. He\u2019s had a lot of practice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not dead.\u201d Foggy points out, wrapping his arms around Matt and jostling him lightly. \u201cI\u2019m good, and Karen\u2019s good, and Elena\u2019s good, and you\u2014you are okay, right? You said you were fine, but you would totally lie about something like that.\u201d Matt exhales slowly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA few bumps and bruises.\u201d He admits softly. \u201cBut nothing that needs a hospital.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d Foggy says, and then because he\u2019s a soppy idiot he reaches up with one hand and strokes Matt\u2019s hair. It\u2019s something he wants to do a lot, when Matt looks like the world\u2019s weighing heavy on his shoulders and one wrong move could shatter him. Usually Foggy can talk himself out of it, but he\u2019s exhausted and in pain and feels like the world is collapsing around him. He needs this.\n\u00a0\nMatt doesn\u2019t protest. In fact, he hums and leans into the touch a little, sighing.\n\u00a0\nFoggy looks down. Matt resting on Foggy\u2019s shoulder so he can only see half of his face, but the half he sees doesn\u2019t look good. There are dark circles under his eyes and a scratch over his eyebrow. His jaw is unshaven and his lips are cracked, and he looks nothing like the Matt Murdock who teases Foggy about his softball skills and argues over the last eggroll. He's pretty clearly had a rough night, possibly even worse than Foggy's.\n\u00a0\nFoggy keeps stroking Matt\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\nFoggy doesn\u2019t know how long they lie there together. He closes his eyes and listens to Matt\u2019s breathing, slow and steady, but catching a little now and then like Matt is purposefully trying to keep it slow and steady and sometimes he messes up. He wonders if Matt\u2019s listening to his breathing too. Feeling ridiculous, he stops and starts until his inhales and exhales match Matt\u2019s so they\u2019re breathing together. Matt\u2019s fingers clench a little in Foggy\u2019s hospital gown, so he thinks Matt notices.\n\u00a0\nAfter a minute of silence and shared breaths, Matt\u2019s hand relaxes and then slips up just an inch or two so that it\u2019s resting over Foggy\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is where it is, right?\u201d Matt asks softly, and Foggy doesn\u2019t bother pretending that he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt shifts, sitting up just enough so that he can rest on an elbow. He has his face tilted down like he\u2019s looking at the Mark. His expression is indecipherable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never talk about it.\u201d Matt says quietly. \u201cNot since that first time.\u201d Foggy shrugs uncomfortably.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t come up much.\u201d He points out. Matt makes a small sound of vague agreement. He remains silent for another moment or two, but Foggy knows that look and he brushes a hand across Matt\u2019s shoulder encouragingly. Matt sighs softly before whispering,\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was just thinking. I\u2019m here, I can listen to your\u2026voice, and make sure you\u2019re okay. And somewhere out there, there\u2019s someone who can\u2019t. Someone who almost lost you, and they don\u2019t even know it.\u201d He exhales deeply, shaking his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that bother you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy is not entirely sure how to phrase this without either lying or giving the messy feelings game away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d Foggy starts carefully. \u201cBut, you said it yourself. I don\u2019t even know this person. I might never know them.\u201d He taps Matt\u2019s forehead gently. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m usually too busy keeping you out of trouble to worry about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt doesn\u2019t smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to cause you trouble.\u201d He murmurs, and he sounds so incredibly guilty that Foggy frowns and flicks his forehead again, harder. Matt yelps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi, I like trouble, Murdock.\u201d He chides. \u201cTrouble is the spice of life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought that was variety.\u201d Matt muses absently, and Foggy nods sagely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you provide a variety of troubles, each one more fun than the last.\u201d When Matt continues looking like he\u2019s a funeral, Foggy sighs and brushes a strand of hair from Matt\u2019s forehead. \u201cMatt, don\u2019t worry about it. I know you\u2019ve got my back when it counts.\u201d Matt shakes his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201d Matt whispers, tortured. \u201cI didn\u2019t answer the phone, and you were in trouble.\u201d He smiles a little mirthlessly. \u201cYour soulmate wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Foggy snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a homing beacon, Matt, or a distress call. My \u2018soulmate\u2019 would have been as clueless as you were.\u201d Foggy doesn\u2019t like using the word \u2018soulmate\u2019 to describe the Mark\u2014it makes his skin itch. He knows who his soulmate is, and it\u2019s not a Devil who can\u2019t even be bothered to show up. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the one who came. A little late, but you got here in the end.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt doesn\u2019t answer, just keeps tracing delicate patterns over the fabric of Foggy\u2019s hospital gown. It doesn\u2019t hurt, exactly, but when Matt\u2019s fingers brush over the Mark on Foggy\u2019s chest, it feels\u2026 warm. Almost too warm, but in a good way. Like hot chocolate that burns your tongue a little but also warms you to the bones.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s never happened before, and it\u2019s the tiniest bit alarming. Foggy doesn\u2019t tell Matt to stop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll be like?\u201d Matt asks, hushed, and Foggy tenses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt\u2026\u201d He warns lowly, and Matt bites his lip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy doesn\u2019t want to do this, but Matt\u2019s asking in that fragile little way he does when he really wants something but is sure that he won\u2019t get it. Foggy sighs. He can do this. He just has to be as general as possible.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I could pick?\u201d He prefaces carefully. \u201cSmart. Really smart, maybe smarter than me but not snobby about it. Funny\u2014and they\u2019d have to think that I was funny too, which is a tall order. Uh, caring, I guess. Generous. Loyal. A nice smile. Kind eyes. A warm laugh\u2026\u201d He\u2019s getting too specific. He might as well be saying \u2018hey, a cane and a law degree would be pretty cool too\u2019. \u201cOh, and they\u2019d have to love you as much as I do. That is a must.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe means to say it in a friend way, doesn\u2019t even think about it, but as soon as it\u2019s out Matt goes very still above him, hand pressing heavy against Foggy\u2019s chest. His face is unreadable again, although the way his mouth is slanting down makes Foggy think Matt\u2019s not thinking happy thoughts.\n\u00a0\nNot good, not good. Did he sound too besotted? Did Matt put the \u2018love\u2019 thing together with Foggy\u2019s stupidly specific guidelines for a soulmate, and now he\u2019s going to tell Foggy that it\u2019s hopeless and he\u2019s sorry and Matt actually\u00a0will\u00a0be sorry, not faking it, and that\u2019s the worst part of all because then they\u2019ll both be miserable and\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t like them?\u201d Matt asks, voice whisper-soft and weighted with something Foggy can\u2019t decipher. Matt licks his lips and taps once on Foggy\u2019s chest, right above the mark. \u201cWhat if I hated them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nYou don\u2019t hate anybody, Foggy wants to say. You\u2019re Saint Matthew, lover of all humanity. He wants to laugh it off and stop talking about this before everything goes wrong, but he doesn\u2019t want to lie to Matt either. And he thinks Matt needs to hear this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t like them, then they wouldn\u2019t be my soulmate.\u201d Foggy tells him simply. \u201cYou\u2019re more important than a dumb tattoo, Matt.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt blinks and swallows hard. After a moment, he leans down and tucks himself back into Foggy\u2019s side, hiding his face.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s breathing is a little ragged. It reminds Foggy of the times he had his mysterious allergy attacks in law school, so he strokes a gentle hand down Matt\u2019s back. Matt\u2019s breath hitches.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Foggy asks him gently, and Matt nods after a moment, hand fisting in Foggy\u2019s hospital gown.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Matt whispers, voice hot and moist against Foggy\u2019s throat. He exhales shakily. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy wakes up the next morning to Matt drooling on his shoulder (again) and a nurse giggling in the hallway. He turns his head to blink blearily at her, and she raises a finger to her lips and smiles before giving him a thumbs-up. Foggy rolls his eyes and grins, and she giggles again before ducking away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMm.\u201d Matt mumbles, shifting a little and running a hand up and down Foggy\u2019s side. \u201cYou awake?\u201d Foggy shakes his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. Go back to sleep, Matt.\u201d He says, ruffling Matt\u2019s hair, and Matt hums and pats Foggy\u2019s hip sleepily.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy wakes up again a few hours later, only to find Matt holding two Styrofoam cups filled with awful hospital coffee and smiling like a loon. Foggy makes appreciative noises as he pretends to drink the awful coffee, and Matt sits on the edge of his bed and does the same.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good morning.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe should get breakfast.\u201d Matt says a few days later on the phone, instead of hello.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, sure.\u201d Foggy says, eying his half-eaten bagel. He can do two breakfasts as long as one of them is with Matt. \u201cI can grab coffee too, if you want\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll come get you. We can go together.\u201d Matt interrupts him quickly. \u201cAnd do you think you could read over the papers we got from Brett while you wait? I know we're missing something. We just need to look a little harder. So, if you'd just look over them again while you wait? Be thorough, okay? No multitasking, no distractions. This is for a client.\"\n\u00a0\nFoggy frowns at the phone. They\u2019ve gone over those papers front to back at least three times, including last night. There's nothing there to help Elena. Still, it\u2019s Matt, so he pulls off Hail Mary passes like this all the time. It's worth a shot, at least.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He agrees, grimacing at the thick stack of papers barely contained within a bulging and battered manilla folder. Thirty pages of dry legal jargon, geez. Foggy's a lawyer,\u00a0and even he finds this part mind-numbing.\u00a0Even speed-reading, that\u2019ll take him until Matt gets there. \u201cYou\u2019re buying, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Matt agrees eagerly, and gives a hasty goodbye. Foggy sighs and opens the folder, pushing the rest of his bagel to the side. Might as well work up an appetite.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s kind of twitchy when he gets there. He seems wound a little too tight, like he\u2019s about to take a deposition that he\u2019s not sure will go well.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYet again: nada.\u201d Foggy informs him tiredly as Matt steps in the door, and Matt gives him a vague smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, really? Sorry for the extra work then. I just wanted to be sure.\" They were already pretty sure last night. Either Matt's desperate enough about this case to retrace his steps, or else he's got something on his mind that's scrambling his brain. After glancing again at Matt's antsy smile, Foggy's betting on the second one. He files away his suspicions for later, too hungry and tired to bother interrogating Matt immediately. It's amazing how much energy reading\u00a0can take out of you if the material is dense enough.\u00a0\"Do you want Nirvana?\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s Foggy\u2019s favorite bakery, but it\u2019s so expensive that he almost never goes there. Matt must feel really guilty about making Foggy read all those papers again, to be willing to pay for it. Score! Definitely interrogate Matt later, after yummy yet expensive snacks are bought and eaten.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDefinitely Nirvana.\u201d Foggy approves, offering Matt his arm even though Matt got up here just fine on his own. Matt slips his hand over Foggy\u2019s elbow and smiles at him a little more confidently, letting Foggy lead him out even though he probably knows the way better than Foggy does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Matt says at one point, and \u201cDo you think\u2026\u201d at another, and \u201cI was wondering\u2026\u201d at yet another. He does this the whole way to the bakery, frowning to himself and stopping as soon as he starts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething you want to talk about, Matt?\u201d Foggy asks him gently, a little amused but also a little worried. \u201cBecause that usually involves using your words to form complete sentences.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt gives him a small, pained smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He apologizes, and tries again. \u201cYou didn't check the news yet, did you?\u201d He says, seemingly out of nowhere. Foggy blinks at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no? I usually check it after breakfast and, well\u2014\u201c He gestures at the line in front of them for the counter. \u201cNo breakfast. Why, was there something important?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Just some things about the bombings.\u201d Matt says, gingerly. He\u2019s always careful about talking about the bombings with Foggy, like he thinks Foggy\u2019s going to burst into tears at the traumatic memories. It\u2019s sweet, but a little exasperating. \u201cYou know, people speculating, guessing\u2014conspiracy theories, really. No real evidence.\u201d He adds hastily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Foggy points out, pulling Matt a step forward in the line. \u201cPeople are going nuts over this. What, did they figure something out?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Matt says slowly. \u201cNo, mostly they\u2019re just pasting new labels on it. But, most people keep coming back to the same person. The masked man from the video.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, him.\u201d Foggy snorts, rolling his eyes. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re eating him up with a spoon. I don\u2019t get why.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s guilty?\u201d Matt asks quickly, sounding interested. Foggy shrugs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe might be. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s running around beating people up and wearing a mask, so he\u2019s already breaking the law. He\u2019s on camera at the scene of the crime, escaping arrest and assaulting officers. He walked away suspiciously unscathed from pointblank range of a detonating bomb. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s the bomber\u2014probable, even. But\u2026\u201d He hesitates. Matt squeezes Foggy\u2019s elbow gently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut?\u201d He urges. Foggy huffs, running a frustrated hand through his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t think he is.\u201d He says bluntly. \u201cAnd for some reason I trust your judgment.\"\u00a0Matt remains silent for a moment, eyes down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think he deserves a fair trial.\u201d Matt acknowledges quietly. \u201cA chance to explain himself. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd let me guess, you\u2019d want to be his legal counsel.\u201d Foggy sighs, rubbing at his temples where a headache is brewing. Matt\u2019s lip quirk minutely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would speak on his behalf, yes.\u201d He agrees serenely, and Foggy shakes his head in dismay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt, you cannot keep taking on all these lost causes.\u201d He begs. \u201cNot everyone is as good as you think they are.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd not everyone is as bad as you think they are.\u201d Matt shoots back immediately, looking surprisingly stung. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t just good and bad, black and white. It\u2019s all shades of gray. I\u2019m not just good and bad, Foggy.\u201d He adds, low and urgent. \u201cDo you understand that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy scoffs, but when Matt tugs hard on his arm, he relents.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I understand that.\u201d He admits, before smiling ruefully. \u201cBut you\u2019re more good than bad, Matt, always have been. Sometimes I wonder if you understand that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt swallows, throat working.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI try to be.\u201d He allows, whispering. \u201cI just want to you consider that maybe the masked man has some good in him too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy watches Matt for a moment. The man\u2019s lips are thin with determination, but his eyes are nervous, darting around Foggy\u2019s face like he\u2019s searching for something there. Foggy isn\u2019t sure that Matt could find it, even if he had the chance to look.\n\u00a0\nHe thinks Matt\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s something dangerous about the man in the mask, something that sets off alarm bells in the back of Foggy\u2019s mind and makes his heart skip a beat when he sees the man on that video. Foggy thinks that Matt\u2019s wrong, and when Matt finds that out, he\u2019s going to be devastated. Despite what he says, Matt always looks for the best in people. Sometimes it works out\u2014he gave Karen a chance and Foggy\u2019s grateful for it every day\u2014but Matt can\u2019t always be right. He\u2019s going to be wrong this time, and\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d Foggy promises.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s going to be wrong this time, and Foggy\u2019s going to have to pick up the pieces.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Matt breathes, and he sounds like he\u2019s just won a particularly hard case, happy but a little haggard. No one should be haggard before noon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Foggy waves him off, uncomfortable with the gratitude. \u201cWhy are you so invested in this, anyway?\u201d He asks Matt, exasperated. \u201cThe guy hasn\u2019t even been caught yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s still and silent for a moment. His fingers tighten a fraction on Foggy\u2019s arm and he opens his mouth\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cNext!\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy looks towards the register to see that even though they haven\u2019t moved, the line in front of them has. The boy behind the register is giving them an impatient look, and Foggy\u2019s guessing this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s called.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Foggy exclaims, flustered and hurrying forward. \u201cUh, three muffins. Two blueberry and, huh. Maybe a banana-nut for Karen? No, chocolate. Two blueberry and a chocolate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy rolls his eyes but reaches into the display case. A minute later Foggy\u2019s out on the street, paper bag tucked in one elbow and Matt tucked in the other.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, you were about to say something?\u201d He asks Matt. \u201cAbout the maybe-bomber?\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\nMatt smiles, but it looks a little forced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI forgot.\u201d He murmurs, and says nothing more on the matter.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s sitting on Matt\u2019s desk and splitting the blueberry muffins down the middle, Solomon-style, when Karen slaps the newspaper down on the desk and exclaims,\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a Devil, he\u2019s an angel!\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy chokes on air and drops the muffin. Wheezing, he manages to splutter at her,\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s a Devil?\u201d He manages to stop coughing, but he finds he can\u2019t quite get his breath back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Man in the Mask!\u201d Karen explains impatiently. \u201cThey\u2019re all saying he\u2019s behind the bombings, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a good person\u2014he saved my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDevil?\u201d Foggy repeats faintly, brain stuck. \u201cThey\u2019re calling him the Devil?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it horrible?\u201d Karen asks, misinterpreting his shock. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have any proof, except that video. Those things are easy to doctor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDevil, Foggy thinks, dazed.\u00a0He looks towards Matt, who is looking towards Karen with a look of open-mouthed, dawning horror. He knew about it, then, but didn\u2019t want Foggy to know. As though he can feel Foggy\u2019s gaze on him, he turns slowly towards him, eyes wide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMuffin.\u201d Foggy murmurs, eyes never leaving Matt\u2019s face. \u201cHere. Muffin. Chocolate.\u201d He grabs at the bag and holds it out for Karen to take.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, wow, thanks!\u201d Karen enthuses. She digs into the bag and takes a bite. \u201cThese are great. Where did you get them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy forgets to answer, and Matt still looks frozen solid. Foggy sees Karen look back and forth between them out of the corner of his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d She says, slowly. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go get some coffee to wash this delicious muffin down. I\u2019ll just slip out and be back\u2026not too soon.\u201d She backs carefully out of the room, and a moment later he hears the office door shut.\n\u00a0\nThe second they\u2019re alone, he rounds on Matt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou knew.\u201d He hisses. \u201cThat\u2019s what you were pussyfooting around this morning, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Matt gives a shallow, tentative nod. \u201cWhat the hell? Why didn\u2019t you just come out and tell me instead of spinning out ridiculous hypotheticals?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I knew you\u2019d react like this!\u201d Matt snaps back with surprising vehemence. \u201cActually, you\u2019d have been even worse, because before this morning you were completely convinced that the masked man was a monster!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor all I know, he still is a monster!\u201d Foggy retorts sharply, and Matt flinches as though he\u2019s been burned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d give him a chance.\u201d Matt murmurs unhappily, and Foggy sighs harshly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I meant it. I\u2019ll give him a chance in a court of law. But as a soulmate?\u201d He shakes his head, frustrated. \u201cNo, you know what? I don\u2019t even need to consider it, because there is no way that this lunatic is my soulmate!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Matt tells him quietly. Foggy snorts, and Matt leans forward, intent. \u201cFoggy, just\u2026think. What if he is? Do you really want to just give up on him before you even try?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Foggy demands angrily. \u201cWhy are you suddenly so sure that this guy is my soulmate? We\u2019ve met tons of other people who could qualify, and you never pushed like this. Why this man, this\u2026 this criminal?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt licks his lips and doesn\u2019t answer for a moment. When he does, it\u2019s a small and pale thing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust\u2026 I have a feeling.\u201d He offers weakly, but what\u2019s even worse is he sounds like he actually believes it. Foggy clenches his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you should fall into his arms or anything, god no. Just, I don\u2019t want you to torture yourself whenever you hear about this man in the news, wondering.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to torture myself!\u201d Foggy assures him, laughing sharply. \u201cI\u2019m not going to think about it at all, beyond indulging in the fleeting fantasy of them catching this guy and chucking him in jail.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s innocent until proven guilty.\u201d Matt reminds him archly, and Foggy huffs, throwing up his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine, so we assume he\u2019s innocent. Him beating up half a dozen cops on video is just an illusion created by Chitauri technology. Some cat-stroking comic book kingpin is framing him for kicks. So what?\u201d He smiles mirthlessly. \u201cYou want me to buy him some flowers and sweep him off his feet? Matt, I don\u2019t even know this man. Even if he\u2019s not a criminal, he could still be a dick.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut he might not be.\u201d Matt points out. \u201cIf he really is the Devil your Mark signifies, then you\u2019d probably even like him. You\u2019d have to, right?\u201d Matt posits uncertainly. Foggy sighs, shaking his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not some kind of voodoo love spell, Matt.\u201d Foggy tells him, softening a little when Matt\u2019s brow furrows, distressed. \u201cCome on, you know that. Marks don\u2019t match sometimes, or they do and it just\u2026 doesn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s not a slam dunk for happily ever after.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut it means there\u2019s a chance.\u201d Matt whispers, gaze turned downward. \u201cYou could live happily ever after.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m happy right now, Matt.\u201d Foggy reminds him, annoyed. \u201cWell, not right at this moment, but generally, yeah. I don\u2019t need a soulmate to be happy. You have to understand that, more than anyone.\u201d He nods towards Matt, remembering Matt\u2019s confession of an Unmarked body. Matt's jaw tightens.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d He grits out. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m not\u2026 denying something that\u2019s a part of me, just because I\u2019m stubborn.\u201d\u00a0Foggy recoils.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He whispers, breathless with anger. \u201cA few days ago, you seemed pretty damn thrilled when I was \u2018denying a part of me\u2019. What\u2019s with the change of heart?\u201d Matt runs a hand through his hair, looking frustrated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d actually find him!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Foggy snaps back. \u201cAll I found is a mention of a man in a mask, who I know nothing about and who might be a mass murderer. The only evidence that he might be my soulmate is a few trite headlines!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s attractive, don\u2019t you? Physically, at least?\u201d Matt pushes, bizarrely intent. \u201cI heard your heartbeat\u2026 spiked in the hospital when you saw the video footage on the news. Karen told me she saw it on the monitors.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKaren is a backstabbing gossip.\u201d Foggy mutters to himself. Louder, he admits, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Matt. I saw him for maybe a second, and the footage was blurry. And yeah, okay, he had a great body even in pixel form, but so do a lot of people. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re meant to be together.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut not a lot of people who you find attractive are being publicly dubbed Devils.\u201d Matt presses. \u201cCome on, Foggy. It\u2019s something. You can\u2019t say it\u2019s not something.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy stares up at the ceiling for a moment, rolling his tongue along the roof of his mouth and gathering his thoughts. Finally, he sighs and looks back down at Matt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt, I told you that I would never pick someone who you didn\u2019t like, remember? Are you seriously telling me that you like this guy? That, what, you\u2019ll hit it off and be his best man at our wedding?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that. I don\u2019t know him.\u201d Matt reassures him quickly. \u201cBut, what if I meet him, and I do? That\u2019s three things, Foggy, three pieces of evidence. That\u2019s starting to look like a pretty good case.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou just said you don\u2019t know him!\u201d Foggy exclaims, maddened. \u201cThere\u2019s no point worrying about this when neither of us has ever met him, and most likely neither of us ever will!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that? With having your soulmate right there, in the same city with you, and doing nothing?\u201d Foggy just glares mutinously, jaw tight. After a moment of taut silence, Matt slumps, looking defeated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026 I want you to be as happy as you can be. And everyone says\u2026\u201d He stops, swallowing audibly.\n\u00a0\nEveryone says that finding your soulmate makes you happy, Foggy finishes in his head. Fairy tales and Disney propaganda say that finding your soulmate is the only thing that can make you happy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Matt.\u201d Foggy breathes, heart aching. He shakes his head. \u201cThis makes me happy.\u201d He gestures between the two of them. \u201cYou, and Karen, and this god-awful office with no air conditioning and a possible roach problem. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all I need.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if you do meet him?\u201d Matt presses quietly. Foggy sighs, tired of fighting and tired of this conversation. He knows what Matt wants to hear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I meet him, Matt, I will bring him straight to your place so you can vet him. Hell, I\u2019ll bring him to the office\u2014you and Karen can vet him together.\u201d He rubs his face, exhausted. \u201cAnd if, if you like him, and he turns out not to be a mass-murdering criminal bomber, and he asks me very nicely, I will maybe let him buy me dinner. I will order the most expensive item on the menu, and we will not go Dutch, and if I am not halfway in love with him by the end of the night, that will be all I let him do, ever.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cFinal offer, Mr. Murdock.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a fair contract. There is the unavoidable loophole that Foggy cannot possibly fall even halfway in love with the masked man, because he\u2019s already completely in love with Matt and there\u2019s no room left for anyone else. But Matt doesn\u2019t need to know that.\n\u00a0\nFoggy\u2019s a lawyer and he\u2019s conditioned not to feel guilty about using loopholes.\n\u00a0\nMatt smiles at him tentatively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the deal, Mr. Nelson.\u201d He says shyly, and they shake hands. Foggy holds on just a second too long and then lets go just a little too quickly to make up for it, clearing his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t have champagne, but we have muffins. Toast?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey tap the two halves of the blueberry muffin together like they\u2019re crystal flutes, faces straight.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Karen slips cautiously back into the office, three coffees in a cardboard caddie, they\u2019re both giggling and making doilies out of the muffin wrappers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are you better at this than me?\u201d Foggy asks, looking between his crippled, holey wrapper and Matt\u2019s intricate mandala. Matt smirks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have an eye for art.\u201d He avers snobbishly, and a moment later they dissolve back into giggles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIdiots.\u201d Karen mutters, but it\u2019s fond.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s pretty chill about the soulmate thing after their initial conversation. Foggy sometimes catches him frowning pensively at Foggy when the Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen pops up in the news, but he never confronts Foggy directly about it again.\n\u00a0\nUntil Foggy finds him bleeding out on the floor of his apartment, still clutching his mask in one hand. That\u2019s pretty direct.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus.\u201d He mutters after Hottie McBurner Phone has sewn Matt up and they\u2019ve gotten him ensconced in bed. Foggy\u2019s had to change, because his clothes were covered in Matt\u2019s blood. Foggy thinks darkly that he\u2019s going to burn them\u2014he can\u2019t ever look at them again without feeling sick. The pajamas itch on his skin when he realizes he\u2019s wearing the Columbia T-shirt that he left over here from his last bro-sleepover, the shirt that Matt bought him for graduation (his favorite, he wears it when he\u2019s sick or sad and needs something soft and comforting), but he refuses to change again because that would be admitting it matters. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a stupid shirt.\n\u00a0\nFoggy desperately wants to go down the entirety of Matt's hidden and very impressive liquor cache, but he has to stay awake and watch Matt for signs of a worsening condition, so he\u2019s stuck here sober and scared out of his mind.\n\u00a0\nHe looks down at Matt, who looks more terrible than Foggy feels. He\u2019s currently rocking a mummy chic look, and what little skin isn\u2019t covered is pallid from blood loss. His eyes are darting back and forth under his eyelids, and when he starts muttering under his breath and clenching the sheets in his hands, Foggy swallows down his own anger and fear and sits down on the bed next to him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt, come on. You\u2019ve got to wake up. We can\u2019t both be having nightmares tonight, okay?\u201d He gives a little hiccuping laugh. \u201cI hate you so much right now, but I still need you to wake up and be okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe reaches out to put a hand on Matt\u2019s cheek. His fingers manage just to brush the skin before Matt\u2019s awake, eyes wild and hand crushing Foggy\u2019s wrist hard enough that Foggy\u2019s worried it\u2019ll shatter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt!\u201d He yelps, shocked and in pain, and Matt lets go like he\u2019s been burned and scrambles away towards the headboard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFoggy?\u201d He whispers hoarsely, and when Foggy nods soundlessly he shudders and buries his face in his knees. \u201cNo, no, no. This can\u2019t be happening.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled about it either.\u201d Foggy gasps out shakily, flexing his injured wrist to make sure it\u2019s not broken. \u201cBut it looks like we don\u2019t get a choice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hurt you.\u201d Matt\u2019s saying into his knees, horrified. \u201cOh god, I hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy wants to say something scathing about how Matt\u2019s done that a lot tonight, or complain that his wrist might be sprained thanks to Matt, or maybe just give a succinct \u2018yeah, asshole\u2019 and leave it at that. He opens his mouth to do so, and then realizes that Matt is, in fact, hyperventilating.\n\u00a0\nDamn it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt, whoa, calm down.\u201d Matt\u2019s breathing gets faster, and Claire mentioned some seriously freaky talents but nothing about not needing oxygen. Foggy climbs up into the bed and touches Matt\u2019s knees briefly before tangling a hand in his hair and tugging gently. \u201cCome on, Matt.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt lets his hair be pulled without lashing out again. When Foggy gets a good look at his face, Foggy kind of wants to have a panic attack too. Matt looks like he\u2019s scared out of his mind, and he knows nothing\u2019s going to stop it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, Matty. Breathe with me, okay?\u201d Foggy orders, presses their foreheads together. He grabs Matt\u2019s hand, placing it over his own heart, hoping that the rhythm of the heartbeat will help, like a metronome. Matt doesn\u2019t try to break his wrist again, thank god. \u201cIn and out. In and out.\u201d It\u2019s not helping. Matt doesn\u2019t even seem to hear him. Foggy searches his mind frantically for something else.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s a martyr, Foggy remembers thinking. Matt\u2019s a saint. Matt\u2019s a hero. Matt needs to save people, but he doesn\u2019t want to be saved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRemember the hospital, when I made my breathing like yours?\u201d Foggy whispers desperately, cupping Matt\u2019s cheeks with his hands and pressing them closer together. \u201cI need you to do that for me now, okay? I need you to help me breathe, Matt, because I\u2019m not doing so good on my own. I need you.\u201d His voice cracks pathetically. \u201cHelp me breathe, Matt.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment or two he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s working, but then Matt\u2019s breathing slows just a little bit, and then a little more. It takes him maybe three minutes to get back to an acceptable rate, and another two for him to speak.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d Matt begs, and he sounds so small and lost that Foggy himself can\u2019t breathe for a moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d He whispers fiercely. \u201cYou owe me a hell of a story.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMatt explains about his accident, and his world on fire\u2014\u201cIt sounds like infrared, Matt, and maybe echolocation. There\u2019s no need to be dramatic.\u201d\u2014and his nocturnal\u2026 extracurricular activities.\n\u00a0\nFoggy\u2019s dazed by the end, and more than a bit hurt that Matt\u2019s kept all this from him. More than once he tries to get up, get away from it all just for a moment. Matt won\u2019t let him. He keeps their hands clasped together the whole time and every time Foggy tenses, gets ready to stand, he squeezes Foggy\u2019s fingers gently and shakes his head. Just a little more, his eyes plead. Just a little longer.\n\u00a0\nFoggy squeezes back and listens just a little longer.\n\u00a0\nEventually Matt finally seems to run out of secrets to tell, or maybe he just runs out of breath instead.\n\u00a0\nFoggy stares at the ceiling for a while, trying to convince himself that Matt\u2019s still Matt, even if he\u2019s not quite Matt anymore. He\u2019s almost managed it when Matt squeezes his hand again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d Matt says, and he sounds almost as scared as when he woke up and couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Foggy replies warily. He might as well get it over with. One more secret is just a drop in the ocean at this point.\n\u00a0\nMatt pushes himself up slowly. Foggy thinks he might be going to stand, but Matt doesn\u2019t let go of his hand or pull away. Instead, he kneels next to Foggy on the bed and reaches out, tentatively. He taps one finger against Foggy\u2019s wrist in an achingly familiar motion\u2014it\u2019s the one Foggy uses to ask if Matt\u2019s okay with extra contact when he\u2019s leading him. More touching.\n\u00a0\nFoggy swallows, and nods. He doesn\u2019t have to narrate for Matt anymore, he realizes, but he does it anyway in a hoarse whisper.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt smiles unsteadily and runs his hand up Foggy\u2019s arm, over his shoulder. Foggy makes an embarrassing little sound when Matt slowly lets the tips of his fingers slip under the collar of Foggy\u2019s shirt. Matt pauses, tapping gently at Foggy\u2019s collarbone.\n\u00a0\nMore touching?\n\u00a0\nFoggy nods, although he can\u2019t quite get the breath to say yes this time.\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s fingers slip further down until they\u2019re resting over Foggy\u2019s heart. Then, deliberately, he traces the word there perfectly, every loop and line.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can see it.\u201d Foggy whispers, stunned. \u201cHow can you see it?\u201d Matt licks his lips, nervous.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it with anyone else.\u201d He confesses quickly. \u201cYours is the only one I can see. It\u2019s got to be body heat, I think. The rest of you is red and yellow and orange, but the Mark\u2026 it burns white.\u201d He smiles, pained, and traces the word again. \u201cI used to hate it so much. It looked like a brand on your skin and every time I saw it, it reminded me. Hands off. Not yours, never yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd now you know that means that I am yours.\u201d Foggy says slowly, watching him carefully. Matt\u2019s smile flashes wide and fierce for a moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d He murmurs hoarsely, tracing the Mark again, and again. He can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cYou have no idea. I must have read that headline a hundred times before I called you. They called me a Devil, and I was so happy I cried.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Foggy accuses quietly, betrayed. \u201cYou knew, and you never told me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Matt whispers, voice thick with regret. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came to see you that morning. It\u2019s why I told you to read ninety pages of nothing\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to read the news. I wanted to tell you myself, to hear your heartbeat when you understood.\u201d Matt pauses, swallowing. The want on his face is so sharp it hurts. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t. I was scared, and after you told me what you thought of me\u2014the other me\u2014I was terrified. What if you said no? What if you hated me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy nods slowly, the pieces clicking into place.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you were so desperate for me to give the Devil a chance.\u201d He laughs quietly. \u201cJesus, Matt. I was so mad at you for that. You know why?\u201d Matt shakes his head, guarded. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t care about the Devil. I didn\u2019t want him.\u201d Matt flinches, face pale. Foggy brushes his thumb over the delicate ridge of Matt's cheekbone, smiling softly. \u201cI just wanted you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Matt breathes, eyes wide. \u201cYou wanted\u2014want?\u201d He gestures to himself messily. Foggy nods, smile widening.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery, very much.\u201d Matt blinks down at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d He sounds disbelieving, completely blindsided. \u201cThis?\u201d He gestures to himself again. Foggy rolls his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Matt. That.\u201d He waves a hand lazily, mimicking Matt\u2019s gesture. \u201cFor a long time, actually. Pretty much as soon as I met you. For a while, I was sort of hoping that your middle name was Lucifer.\u201d He snorts. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s Michael. A freaking archangel, Matt. Do you know how frustrating that was?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry?\u201d Matt offers hesitantly. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I sort of wish my middle name had been Lucifer too. It would have made things a lot easier.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt certainly would have.\u201d Foggy tells him primly, but he only manages a moment without smiling. \u201cSo, Matthew Michael Murdock, devil o\u2019 mine. Soulmate.\u201d He adds, a little dizzily, tasting how it feels on his tongue. For once it doesn\u2019t taste bitter in his mouth, because it doesn\u2019t mean some stranger to resent for never being there, it means Matt. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMatt shudders, eyes slipping shut for a moment. When he opens them, his eyes are so dilated they\u2019re almost black.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I just\u2014?\u201d He asks, rather nonsensically. He shakes his head like he\u2019s trying to clear it. \u201cI just need to\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for a response, leaning down and pressing a light, gentle kiss over the Mark. It sparks under Foggy\u2019s skin, the hot chocolate heat of before coming back tenfold, just this side of painful\u2014too much, and Foggy gasps from it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo that again.\u201d He begs, voice faint and dazed. Matt smiles and does so, lingering longer this time, dragging his lips just a little upwards before pulling back. Foggy shivers. \u201cAgain.\u201d Matt does. \u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2026 intense.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Matt asks lowly. He\u2019s grinning lazily up at Foggy, so pleased and loose that he looks almost drugged. \u201cGood?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d Foggy agrees quickly, breathlessly. \u201cGreat. Perfect. Wow. Matt.\u201d He can\u2019t seem to form a completely sentence, but he thinks he gets his point across. When Matt blushes at the praise, previously smug smile turning a little bashful, Foggy has to yank him up for a kiss.\n\u00a0\nMatt hums happily, tilting his head and leaning into it. Matt kisses wet and slow, and the whole time he keeps his hand pressed against Foggy\u2019s Mark and sends steady jolts of pleasure down his spine. And Foggy can barely handle it, it\u2019s perfect and more than he\u2019s ever dreamed of, and he presses his hand against Matt\u2019s chest so that he can feel it too\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t touch you back.\u201d He whispers against Matt\u2019s mouth, shattered. Matt pulls back, smile confused but still content.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHm?\u201d He asks, absently. \u201cYou\u2019re touching me right now.\u201d Foggy shakes his head. He feels suddenly, bitterly cold.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Matt. I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t touch you back.\u201d He pushes gently against Matt\u2019s chest again, over his heart where there\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s nothing.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s nothing anywhere. Matt told him so himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Matt murmurs weakly, and then his fingers clench in the fabric of Foggy\u2019s T-shirt and panic blooms on his face. \u201cOh. No, Foggy. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Foggy swallows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt means I\u2019m yours.\u201d He says, voice small. \u201cI\u2019m yours, and you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d Mine.\n\u00a0\nIt was different, when he thought that Matt didn\u2019t match him either. It would have been the two of them against the world, fighting the Fates. But now he\u2019s trapped. He\u2019s just as much of a slave to his Mark as he\u2019d always feared. He\u2019s stuck, and Matt\u2019s\u2026 not.\n\u00a0\nMatt makes a low, wounded sound.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. I\u2026\u201d He shakes his head, devastated. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t have the Mark to prove it. I should. I should have it over every inch of my skin, because I\u2019m yours, Foggy. Completely.\u201d Foggy can\u2019t answer. Matt leans forward, eyes darting helplessly over Foggy\u2019s face. What does he see? Red, yellow, orange. White. Not mine. Never mine. \u201cPlease, Foggy. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy\u2019s Mark thrums under his skin like a live-wire where Matt\u2019s touching it. It feels like it matters.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt\u2026\u201d Foggy starts quietly, and then finds he can\u2019t think of anything to say. There\u2019s nothing that can make this better. Matt blinks rapidly, throat working, and then he leans forward and buries his face against Foggy\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake. They made a mistake, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He takes a shuddery, breath, and Foggy feels warm drops of wetness sliding down the hollow of his throat. Crying. Matt\u2019s crying. \u201cPlease. I love you.\u201d \n\u00a0\nMatt, heavy on top of him. Wetness soaking through the shoulder of Foggy\u2019s shirt. It sparks a memory, one years old and care-worn in his mind. Avocados and blanket forts and an epiphany he promised to never forget.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMatt Murdock is the love of his fucking life, and the world and the Devil can deal with it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh. Foggy gasps and lurches back into motion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d He whispers, running a tender hand through Matt\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t matter. I love you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt gives a single, broken sob.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d He pulls back, and his cheeks are wet and his eyes are red, and he looks nothing like the Matt who smiled lazily at Foggy and kissed his Mark just minutes before. \u201cI should have one. You should be there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Foggy tells him, shaking his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need one. You love me. I know that\u2014I don\u2019t need a Mark to remind me.\u201d Matt looks unconvinced, and Foggy smiles at him and wipes a tear away as it falls. \u201cHey. You\u2019re it for me, Murdock. You don\u2019t get to chicken out just because you don\u2019t have some silly scribble on your skin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not chickening out.\u201d Matt protests weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me too. I just wish\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy is well aware of Matt\u2019s ability to guilt himself sick. He\u2019s going to have to nip this one in the bud.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he drawls casually, \u201cIf you really want a mark that badly, I can make you one.\u201d Matt makes a puzzled sound. Foggy taps his fingers gently against Matt\u2019s chest, and then against his collarbone, and then against his neck. \u201cA lot of them, actually. They take some upkeep, but I think that\u2019s part of the fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt gapes down at him for a second, shocked. Foggy grins back up at him unrepentantly. After a moment of stunned silence, Matt snorts, and then chuckles, and then laughs loud and wet and only a little too desperate.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are horrible at flirting.\u201d He informs Foggy, and Foggy shrugs easily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who fell in love with me. I guess you\u2019re into bad flirting.\u201d It makes him giddy to say it. Matt\u2019s in love with him. Matt\u2019s in love with him. Years and years of wanting this, and suddenly he gets all of it and more.\u00a0Matt smiles down at him timidly. He\u2019s still crying. Matt\u2019s an ugly crier\u2014his face gets blotchy and his nose gets red and his eyes tend to water for a while afterward like his body\u2019s not quite sure if he\u2019s done or not.\n\u00a0\nFoggy thinks that Matt\u2019s probably the most beautiful thing he\u2019s ever seen, blotchy and red and leaky and all.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am very\u00a0into bad flirting.\u201d Matt admits unashamedly, and Foggy laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI promise once you get past the flirting part, my skills are much more impressive.\u201d He gestures broadly outwards with his hands. \u201cLike, mind? Blown.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt\u2019s smile widens and he leans down until their lips just barely brush.\n\u00a0\n\u201cProve it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFoggy has to say, he\u2019s done some of his best work tonight. He\u2019d had to work around Matt\u2019s injuries, and he\u2019d also had to pin Matt down at more than one point when Matt got a little too enthusiastic and almost pulled his stitches. Still, the end result?\n\u00a0\nPretty impressive.\n\u00a0\nHe licks lazily at Matt\u2019s shoulder, sparing a moment or two to suck on a bite mark that\u2019s not quite dark enough yet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVampire.\u201d Matt mumbles fondly, and Foggy grins against the mark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I do seem to remember sucking you dry earlier tonight, yes. Twice.\u201d He agrees mildly. Matt snorts scathingly, and it\u2019s so completely unattractive that Foggy only wants to kiss him a little bit. Maybe more than a little. Maybe more than a lot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d Matt mutters, and then rolls over to tuck himself into Foggy\u2019s side without even bothering to open his eyes. Foggy mourns the loss of the bite mark for a brief moment before turning his attention instead to the delicate shell of Matt\u2019s ear. When Matt swats at him faux-irritably, Foggy catches his hand and kisses the palm, and then presses another quick kiss to the top of Matt's head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you.\u201d Foggy tells him softly, because it\u2019s been almost five minutes since he said it last and that is clearly far too long. He can just catch the corner of Matt\u2019s shy smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d Matt whispers back, and he sounds just as dopily besotted as he did when he said it back five minutes ago. \u201cNow go to sleep. I am not going to be the one to explain to Karen why we\u2019re stumbling into the office looking like zombies later.\u201d Foggy flicks his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. We\u2019re calling in sick.\u201d He snickers. \u201cLovesick. It\u2019s contagious.\u201d Matt groans, and Foggy kisses the top of his head again. \u201cOkay, okay. We are calling in sick, though. In fact, I don\u2019t think you should leave the bed at all today. To recover, of course. Maybe try to sweat it out.\u201d He can't help himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBad flirting.\u201d Matt mutters to himself woefully. \u201cI\u2019ve shackled myself to a lifetime of bad flirting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd exceptionally good everything else.\u201d Foggy points out, and Matt hums agreeably. \u201cAlright, sleep. Love you.\u201d He adds, because he can\u2019t not say it now that he has the chance.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you.\u201d Matt replies easily, already sounding halfway to dreaming.\n\u00a0\nFoggy watches him for a minute or two. Matt\u2019s lovely like this, hair mussed and kiss-bruised in bed. His lips are still red and fresh-bitten, and they\u2019re curved upwards in a dreamy little smile. He\u2019s still a bit too ragged around the edges, too many too-white bandages wrapped around his skin, but time will take care of that.\u00a0Foggy smiles and runs a hand down the plane of Matt\u2019s back, careful over the bandages and lingering over the rest. Matt\u2019s got little goose bumps raised near the dimples of his back. and Foggy rubs at them to warm Matt\u2019s skin while he reaches for the blankets.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got them just past Matt\u2019s hips when he realizes that they\u2019re not goose bumps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt.\u201d Foggy murmurs, shaking him gently awake. Matt grumbles and squints at him. \u201cTurn over, I need to see your back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Matt grouses, but he turns over without further prompting. Foggy carefully draws his fingers over the skin again, and when he finds what he\u2019s looking for he can\u2019t keep a tiny sob of laughter from bubbling up and out of him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMatt, you have a Mark.\u201d Foggy tells him giddily, and Matt rolls over again to face him, grumpy face softening with affection.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know. I have two dozen of them, the last time I counted.\u201d He agrees contentedly, poking a particularly large one on his neck. \u201cSo do you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I mean, you have a Mark. Capital \u2018M\u2019.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatt goes very still, and then sits up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke about that.\u201d He murmurs, voice thin and frail, hunching in a little on himself. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I wouldn\u2019t joke about that, ever.\u201d Foggy promises him, sitting up too so he can reach Matt more easily. \u201cNo, Matt, you\u2019ve got one. Right here.\u201d He runs a finger over Matt\u2019s back, over the word, savoring the feel of it under his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder we didn\u2019t see it before, because you can\u2019t see it, not unless you know how to look. Matt, it\u2019s in Braille.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFoggy can\u2019t stop grinning. He feels like it\u2019s going to split his face in half. He laughs again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBraille.\" He repeats to Matt incredulously. \"Jesus, Matty, you can't do anything the easy way. You are so lucky I flunked Punjabi for this. Here, hold on.\u201d He sits up, scrambling onto the other side of Matt so that he can get a closer look. From maybe an inch away, he can just barely see them. They\u2019re the same color as the rest of Matt\u2019s skin, and as small as freckles. \u201cWow, it\u2019s practically invisible. But it\u2019s there, no doubt about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Matt says flatly. \u201cI would have felt it. I would have known.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot if you already 'knew' it wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Foggy points out quietly. When Matt shakes his head, looking sick, Foggy takes his hand. \u201cNo, here. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He gently tugs Matt\u2019s hand behind his back, guiding him. \u201cYou start here, and then you just run along to the side here\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe lets go and climbs back around so he can face Matt again, allowing Matt to feel along the raised bumps. Foggy focuses on Matt\u2019s face instead. He watches as Matt\u2019s lips part and his eyes widen. He watches Matt finish reading the word, and then go back and start again, and there are tears building in Matt\u2019s eyes and a trembling little smile tugging at his mouth, small but filled to the brim with joy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s your name.\u201d Matt whispers, stretching back awkwardly so that he can press his whole hand over it at once. Foggy beams and reaches over, letting his fingers brush against Matt\u2019s as he rubs his thumb over the first letter, the bold little bumps of an \u2018F\u2019 with a great deal of attitude and camouflage skill. \u201cFoggy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Foggy agrees faintly, entranced. \u201cGod, Matt, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s there.\u201d Matt retorts breathlessly, like that\u2019s even better than perfect. In a way, it is.\u201cYou\u2019re there.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Sure am. Signed for the package and everything.\" Foggy concurs, teasing gently. Matt ignores him, running his fingers along his back again, shuddering, and ghosting his index finger along the bottom of Foggy's Mark at the same time. It's the lightest touch, barely even there, but Foggy's touching Matt's Mark too and somehow that makes it a million times everything, exploding\u00a0from fireworks to supernova.\u00a0Foggy whimpers, hips canting forwards helplessly.\n\u00a0\n\"Well,\" Matt murmurs, repeating the motion slowly, experimentally. Shudder. Whimper. \"This should be fun.\"\n\u00a0\nHe gives a sudden, savage grin and crushes their mouths together. Foggy makes a little sound that parts his lips, surprised by the strength of the kiss. Matt uses the opportunity to lick into his mouth, presses his hand against Foggy\u2019s Mark until it\u2019s thrumming white-hot under his fingers and under Foggy\u2019s skin. Matt\u2019s been quick to catch on to exactly how sweet that spot is for Foggy, and has been abusing it ruthlessly all night. This time, Foggy gets to return the favor.\n\u00a0\nMatt gives hitching little moans when Foggy strokes lightly across his name as a whole, and then slowly, purposefully over each letter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, that\u2019s good.\u201d Matt pulls back just long enough to hiss, and then he\u2019s biting hard at Foggy\u2019s lower lip until Foggy gasps and lets him back in. Matt doesn\u2019t stop there, pushing hard directly against the Mark until Foggy\u2019s down onto the bed and Matt\u2019s straddling him, smirking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s try that again, shall we?\u201d Matt muses, voice low and dark with promise. \u201cEyes on me. Hands on me. Mouth on me.\" He leans down to whisper into Foggy\u2019s ear, hot and sweet. \u201cGo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile having sex with Matt is generally pretty damn perfect, having sex with Matt when Matt\u2019s happy, horny and holding him down is... Is. There are no words.\n\u00a0\nAfterwards, the weak morning sunlight catches in Matt\u2019s hair and highlights the red that\u2019s usually too dark to see. His skin is glowing with a thin sheen of sweat, and he\u2019s stretching his arms above his head and arching his spine languidly, lithe as a panther. When he catches Foggy looking, Matt grins down at him, crooked mouth and wicked eyes.\n\u00a0\nDevil, Foggy thinks, sharp and sure.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDevil in the sack.\u201d Foggy murmurs thoughtfully, remembering Matt's suggestion from years ago. Matt gives a startled, delighted laugh\u2014he remembers too\u2014and Foggy shrugs, smiling. \u201cWell, at least it's not false advertisement.\u201d He yanks Matt back down for a kiss.\n\u00a0\nThe universe must have planned a million things out just for this one moment. So many little things all working together and making one work of art. A man with the Devil inside of him. An accident and a message crafted in Braille instead of bold colors and elegant script. Choosing Columbia over NYU on a hunch. Two roommates, one cramped dorm room and the friendship of a lifetime. Avocados. Tiny dots crafting a secret masterpiece on pale skin. Braille.\n\u00a0\nThe Devil really is in the details."
