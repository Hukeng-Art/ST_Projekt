Blinking into the darkness, Midoriya spots his phone on the nightstand, the screen flashing in time to the vibrations of the device. He knows it\u2019s ridiculously late in the night, but it could be an emergency.\nWith tear-filled eyes, Midoriya snags the device off his table and squashes the receive button with his thumb, bringing the device to his left ear.\n\u201cHello?\u201d His voice is thick with sleep.\nThere\u2019s an uninterrupted static on the other end of the phone before a voice, familiar but not intimate like Iida\u2019s or Ocha\u2019s inquires, \u201cIs this Midoriya Izuku?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s brain is still muddled with sleep, but he blinks rapidly, trying to awaken himself just a little. \u201cYes,\u201d he answers, clearing his throat.\n\u201cHi,\u201d the voice says breathlessly. Midoriya can hear a smile in the person\u2019s tone, and it makes his own lips tug at the corners in a small, cute grin.\n\u201cHello.\u201d He pulls the device away and looks at the caller-id, flinching when the screen brightness blinds him painfully. When the name registers in his brain, he makes a very embarrassing noise and brings the phone back to his ear immediately.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sniffle. \u201cYes?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s heart is pounding. His palms are sweating, making it difficult to hold the damn phone, and his mouth is suddenly drier than the damn Sahara.\nHe\u2019s dreamed about calling Todoroki so many times, dreamed about hearing his voice and just talking to him for hours, but he didn\u2019t dare bring it up in conversation. He didn\u2019t see them as close enough, and besides, Todoroki seemed to be busy all the time. What they had was pretty incredible already, so Midoriya didn\u2019t want to risk it.\nBut for Todoroki to be calling him? That hadn\u2019t occurred even in his wildest dreams.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he whispers, cupping the phone reverently.\nTodorki chuckles, a smooth, warm, almost rusty sound. \u201cHello. It\u2019s nice to put a voice to the face and the freckles and the butt.\u201d\nMidoriya feels himself blush crimson, and he buries his face in his pillow, muffling his screams.\n\u201cTodoroki, please don\u2019t,\u201d he begs, nearly in tears again. \u201cBy the way, are you drunk?\u201d\nHis speech isn\u2019t too impaired, nor is he slurring his words, but Midoriya\u2019s watched enough of his interviews to know what his normal talking sounds like, and this isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s lazy, almost playful, and the s\u2019s are dragged just the slightest bit.\n\u201cNot drunk,\u201d Todoroki disagrees. \u201cNot drunk, but tipsy probably.\u201d\nMidoriya giggles.\n\u201cIf you say so. Where are you?\u201d\n\u201cHome.\u201d He drags the O in a way that makes Midoriya melt. He sounds just the way he does on screen, but better, so much better. Warm, like sun on a patch of grass, and smoother than the finest silk. Midoriya could listen to him speak forever.\n\u201cSo, what can I do for you?\u201d\nTodoroki hums. \u201cWell,\u201d he starts, \u201cI have a thought I need an opinion on. Unbiased.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cAm I unlovable?\u201d\nMidoriya freezes, the playful atmosphere vanishing in a moment. Todoroki sounds jovial, but Midoriya can sense pain, even when it\u2019s masked so well. His heart clenches at the implication of the question, and a part of him is unsure about how to proceed. He doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing and upset the man in any way.\n\u201cWhere is this question coming from?\u201d\nTodoroki scoffs. \u201cEverywhere. I mean, I, I\u2019ve always been repeatedly reminded of the fact that I was a mistake, unlike my sisters. My parents had me by mistake. Mom always told me she loved me but dad, dad just, he couldn\u2019t stand me, you know?\u201d\nMidoriya sits up gingerly, scratching the back of his head with blunt nails.\n\u201cTodoroki, mistake or not, you\u2019re alive this very minute, are you not? You\u2019re self-sufficient and successful, and you\u2019re leading your own life, a very good one. I\u2019ve texted you for about two months now, and every day you make it abundantly clear that you\u2019re a human being with great character and personality. And I\u2019m not just saying this as a fan, I\u2019m-\u201c Midoriya sucks in a shaky breath \u201c-I\u2019m saying this as your friend.\u201d\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that Todoroki and his father are on bad, probably horrendous terms. His father is in the film-making business as well, and he\u2019s quite popular, specializing in the more violent-action type films. But his behavior towards his son, his blatant disregard for him as an actual human being, makes him a controversial being all around. Midoriya respects his talent and skill, but not the man himself.\nHis little speech is met by more silence, but it\u2019s oddly comfortable. Todoroki\u2019s breathing is deep and steady, and Midoriya almost assumes the man\u2019s asleep when he makes a tiny sound, a soft hum.\n\u201cThank you, Midoriya.\u201d\nMidoriya smiles, falling back on the bed, head dangling off the edge. \u201cAnytime, Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you up to?\u201d\n\u201cWell-\u201c\n\u201cWait, what time is it?\u201d Midoriya hears some shuffling and then a muffled gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s so late, you must\u2019ve been sleeping! I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll hang up im-\u201c\nMidoriya waves his free hand around in a sort of panic. \u201cIt\u2019s ok! It\u2019s ok, I don\u2019t mind. If you\u2019d like, maybe we could talk some more?\u201d\nTodoroki grumbles,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Midoriya smiles. \u201cNow, tell me something- when actors get accidental boners while filming, what do they do with it?\u201d\nProbably not the best question to ask- in fact, Midoriya wants the earth to open up right about now and swallow him whole but then a burst of laugh, short and loud and so very sweet, resonates in his skull. It\u2019s from the phone jammed between his ear and shoulder, and it leaves Midoriya breathless, leaves him craving more.\n\u201cNot the most subtle, are you?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s face is home to all the blood in his body at this point, and he\u2019s so glad he isn\u2019t standing in front of the man. \u201cShhh you,\u201d he mutters, turning in bed and burying his face in his sheets.\nTodoroki laughs again, \u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d\nMidoriya whimpers. \u201cPlease don\u2019t expose me so shamelessly.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d Todoroki declares, and Midoriya suddenly wants to see him because he\u2019s sure, he\u2019s so sure the man is smiling right now, probably with crinkles around his eyes and Midoriya wants to see it because he put it there. He\u2019s still sleepy, but there\u2019s a different kind of contentment that settles within his ribcage, right under his thudding heart.\n\u201cI do think you\u2019re amazing,\u201d he whispers softly, a wave of courage washing over him. \u201cI think you\u2019re talented and smart, you\u2019re sweet and funny, and I just. I\u2019m glad I know you.\u201d\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t say a word, but his even breathing and the soft whoosh of air that leaves him with every exhale tells Midoriya all he needs to know.\n\u201cGoodnight, Shouto,\u201d he says, before switching the phone off.\nIt\u2019s been a long, long night.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTodo [7:03]\nhello, did I call you last night by any chance?\nIzuku [7:34]\nyou did, and we even had a nice, long chat xD\nTodo [7:47]\nit upsets me that I don\u2019t remember a word of our first conversation\nIzuku [7:51]\nspeaking of which, is it alright if we talk again? Just wanted to, uh, say somethings\nTodo [8:24]\nim busy right now, ill text you when im free\nIzuku [8:56]\nok\nTodo [6:35]\nI\u2019m done filming and im free for a bit\nIzuku [6:52]\ncan I call?\nTodo [6:56]\nsure\n\n&lt;incoming call.....&gt;\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s voice is crisp, cold and business like. Midoriya doesn\u2019t really like it, but he can understand the man\u2019s apprehension. If he doesn\u2019t remember last night, he\u2019s probably anxious about what he might\u2019ve said, so while Midoriya feels disappointed, he doesn\u2019t let it get to him.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he breathes, a smile breaking out on his face. Cold or not, talking to Todoroki still feels like a dream come true. \u201cHow was filming?\u201d\n\u201cExhausting,\u201d Todoroki sighs, and Midoriya hears a door shut in the back. \u201cHold on.\u201d He hears muffled voices in the background before Todoroki says, \u201cOk, go ahead.\u201d\nMidoriya inhales sharply, \u201cI wanted to talk about last night.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Todoroki agrees tentatively.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Midoriya says, \u201cit\u2019s nothing bad per se. I just, well, you got me a little worried.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally drink like that,\u201d Todoroki grumbles, and Midoriya giggles into the back of his palm.\n\u201cThe drinking part is fine, it\u2019s the things you said that got me worried.\u201d Moving to a more private part of his department, Midoriya sinks to the ground and stares at his knees. \u201cYou spoke about your dad.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice becomes positively frigid, making Midoriya shiver. He somehow manages to hold his ground.\n\u201cYou spoke about mistakes and the like. Listen, irrespective of whether you\u2019re drunk or not, I want you to be able to confide in me. Maybe I can present you with a truly unbiased opinion. I know two months isn\u2019t a lot, but I feel like I know you. Just, all I\u2019m saying is that you can trust me. With anything.\u201d\nNo one speaks for a while, till Todoroki exhales noisily. \u201cThank you, really.\u201d He sounds sincere, to the extent where Midoriya\u2019s shoulders slump and a smile, small and intimate, curves his lips.\n\u201cGrowing up, my dad was never around.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s telling Todoroki this, but once he starts, he can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cMom pretty much raised me by herself. Dad would come back sometimes, but never for long enough. I love him, but only because he\u2019s my biological father. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I only have one true parent.\nYour blood doesn\u2019t define you. And besides, it\u2019s the family you make of your friends that truly matters. Being bound by blood is one thing, but choosing to be with someone is a whole different ball game.\u201d\nThe silence is shorter this time. \u201cHonestly? I\u2019m pretty lucky. Momo and Kaminari and pretty much everyone has been like family for the longest time. Plus, mother and I have been talking more lately.\u201d\nMidoriya grins wide enough for his cheeks to ache. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s also you,\u201d Todoroki adds softly, almost shyly. Midoriya\u2019s cheeks practically burst into flames at the proclamation, and he doesn\u2019t think he can speak coherently even if he tried.\n\u201cTo-to-todorokiii! You can\u2019t just say that!\u201d\nTodoroki laughs again, full and just so warm, and somehow, all is right with the world.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouto [12:09]\nI told him about dad\nMomo [12:13]\nREALLY???\nShouto [12:16]\nyeah\nMomo [12:18]\nfuck\nMomo [12:21]\nyoure getting serious\nShouto [12:27]\nhelp me\nMomo [12:33]\nsorry kiddo\nMomo [12:39]\nyoure on your own\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku [10:15]\nyoure a cardiologist\nOcha [10:28]\nand youre stating the obvious\nIzuku [10:31]\nmy point is\nIzuku [10:33]\nif my heartrate picks up exponentially at the mention of a person\nIzuku [10:36]\nand if said person texts or calls, I feel elated and the heartbeat seems to become inconsistent\nIzuku [10:37]\nwhat could be the possible prognosis?\nOcha [10:40]\neither an anxiety attack or love\nOcha [10:41]\ntake your pick\nIzuku [10:43]\nfml\nOcha [10:48]\nwanna get drunk?\nIzuku [10:53]\nseriously, theres nothing else u can think of to distract me?\nOcha [10:56]\nis that a no?\nIzuku [11:21]\nopen the door, im outside.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouto [6:18]\nhello midoriya\nMido [6:24]\nwhats up?\nShouto [6:30]\n&lt;image attached&gt;\n &lt;image attached&gt;\n &lt;image attached&gt;\nMido [6:36]\nthe third one for sure\nShouto [6:37]\nMomo says she loves you\nMido [6:40]\n&gt;///////////&lt;\nMido [6:43]\ntell her I said I love her back \u2665(\u02c6\u2323\u02c6\u0505)\nShouto [6:48]\n\u2026.. id rather not\nMido [6:55]\nhuh?\nShouto [7:13]\nnevermind, I have to go.

There\u2019s no way he isn\u2019t, not with every thing that\u2019s happened.\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\nTodoroki sounds so worried, and it\u2019s bloody endearing as hell. Midoriya smiles tiredly, leaning into the door of the ambulance. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he reassures, wincing when the cold metal bites into his skin. \u201cJust a little banged up and bruised, but ok.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Todoroki swears, making Midoriya\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. Todoroki almost never swears, so he must be really scared to be reacting this way. \u201cI was so worried! I heard about the hostage situation and briefly caught a glimpse of you running into the building and then nothing. I was so scared, fuck.\u201d\nMidoriya chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m ok, I swear. It\u2019s my job afterall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I get the feeling you get into more trouble than most?\u201d Todoroki asks dryly.\nMidoriya shrugs. \u201cBeats me.\u201d When Uraraka taps his shoulder, he glances up and nods. \u201cListen, I gotta go, get done with my checkups and all you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah no, please go ahead.\u201d Todoroki sighs. \u201cText me later?\u201d\nMidoriya rests his head on Uraraka\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku [11:34]\nthank you for the flowers, they were beautiful &lt;3\nTodo-dodo &lt;3 [11:37]\nyoure welcome, are you feeling better?\nIzuku [11:40]\ndefinitely!\nIzuku [11:41]\n&lt;image attached&gt;\nIzuku [11:43]\nthe kids in the same hospital wing made me a flower crown out of the bouquet!\nTodo-dodo &lt;3 [11:50]\nit looks wonderful on you.\nIzuku [11:53]\n&gt;//////////////&lt;\nIzuku [11:57]\nI really don\u2019t have blood to spare, don\u2019t do this to me\nTodo-dodo &lt;3 [12:01]\njust when I thought I was making progress with you -.-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nOcha [5:42]\nhow does your head feel ?\nIzuku [5:44]\nits fine, im ok ocha, I promise\nOcha [5:48]\nI believe u\nOcha [5:49]\nbut katsuki will kill me if I don\u2019t follow up every few days\nIzuku [5:51]\nthat tsundere &lt;3\nOcha [5:55]\nhahaha (\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u30ce\nIzuku [6:04]\nOcha?\nOcha [6:18]\nhmmm?\nIzuku [6:21]\nim falling in love with him\nOcha [6:27]\nI know\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku [8:21]\nim back for duty tomorrow\nKacchan [8:30]\nabout time asshole\nIzuku [8:32]\nI missed u too &lt;3\nKacchan [8:36]\nI really hate u\nIzuku [8:41]\nit\u2019s a fine line u know\nKacchan [8:45]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nKacchan [8:46]\njust don\u2019t die on my watch fucker\nIzuku [8:49]\nwouldn't dream of it\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n&lt;missed call: ocha (11)&gt;\n\nOcha [3:04]\nMIDORIYA IZUKU\nOcha [3:05]\nWATCH THE TALK NETWORK\nOcha [3:07]\nRIGHT NOW\nOcha [3:09]\nRIGHT THIS BLOODY INSTANT\nIzuku [7:21]\nsorry I just switched my phone on\nIzuku [7:23]\nwhats up/\nOcha [7:44]\n&lt;link attached&gt;\nOcha [7:47]\nIts pretty self explanatory\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n&lt;incoming \u2013 Mido &gt;\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s been expecting this call, quite anxiously too, but he hadn\u2019t expected the panting.\nHe clears his throat, \u201cMidoriya?\u201d\n\u201cD-\u201c Midoriya coughs a little before trying again \u201c-did you just..\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Todoroki prompts.\n\u201cI might be in over my head,\u201d Midoriya says deliriously, \u201cbut did you just ask me out? On national television?\u201d\nTodoroki smiles shakily, biting his lip to avoid any embarrassing noises that seem determined to slip past his lips. Inhaling deeply, Todoroki tries to calm himself down as much as possible.\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\nIt hadn\u2019t been anything grand; it wasn\u2019t really planned either. When the host, Mr Yamada, had inquired about his lovelife, Todoroki had remembered the shooting and spilled some of the beans, confessing that the person he liked had gotten in grave danger and that he wished to take them out for a cup of coffee soon. Mr Yamada had whistled at that, and Todoroki had blushed profusely, unable to contain himself.\n\u201cIt isnt a joke?\u201d Midoriya whispers, and Todoroki swallows thickly. Should he lie and say yes?\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answers before he can make up his mind. He\u2019s never been a good liar anyway.\nMidoriya stays silent for a beat too long, so Todoroki speaks to fill the silence. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer me right away Midoriya. We\u2019ve known each other for over half a year now, but I know it\u2019s so abrupt, so-\u201c\n\u201cYou can\u2019t break my heart.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s mouth goes dry and he feels his face flush. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI absolutely will not forgive you if you do. Got it?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice is shaking.\nTodoroki nods. \u201cGot it.\u201d\nMidoriya sniffles. \u201cOk, so, I\u2019m still at work. Can we, uh, make plans when I get back home?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Todoroki smiles. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry, this is a good thing right?\u201d\n\u201cThe best,\u201d Izuku agrees, laughing. \u201cOk then, bye Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cShouto.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nTodoroki feels his cheeks warm. \u201cCall me Shouto.\u201d\nMidoriya makes a small whining noise. \u201cFine,\u201d he concedes. \u201cOnly if you call me Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cDone. Bye Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cB-bye, Shouto.\u201d\nTodoroki hangs up with a flushed face and a thundering heart.\nIzuku [8:21]\nI see buildings I can jump off of\nShouto [8:22]\nOH COME ON\u00a0"
