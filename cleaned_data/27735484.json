    "text": "\n1\n\nThe first time it happens, Andrew assumes Neil is just fucking around.\nNeil\u2019s chin is propped in his hands while he studies a drink menu with the kind of intensity that tells Andrew he is just past tipsy. Andrew stands with his back to the bar, surveying the technicolor silhouettes of the crowd, because Neil will not stand with his back to the club without someone watching his six.\n\u201cMemorized that yet,\u201d Andrew says, because Neil has been deliberating for nearly ten minutes. Sober Neil will drink whatever is poured for him, neat, no questions. Drunk Neil is more amenable to beverages that stain his tongue bright colors and make his lips taste like sour Skittles.\nNeil gives Andrew a sarcastic smile and shifts his weight to press their shoulders together. Andrew allows it. Part of the job description for babysitting Drunk Neil.\nAndrew sips his one and only drink for the night \u2014 ritual, more than alcohol, to deaden the buzz under his skin that inevitably arises when surrounded by so many half-lit faces and loose, wandering bodies. The whiskey is a slow smolder down his throat, and Andrew turns back in time to catch Neil watching his swallow with interest. Andrew allows himself a moment to enjoy Neil's attention before he nudges Neil and jerks his chin at the menu. \u201cOrder.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d Neil returns to his task with the closest thing to a pout that Andrew has ever seen on his face.\nNeil is full of new expressions while drunk. Some more annoying than others, but all as close to unguarded as Neil Josten ever gets. Right there and only for Andrew to memorize. It almost makes being sober \u2014 which Andrew must be, for Neil to allow himself to drink in any public setting, ever \u2014 worth it. That, and the knowledge that Neil now owes him one. Andrew mulls over the ways he could spend his favor while continuing to scan the club.\nHe is on particular lookout for a couple of people he caught making interested eyes at Neil tonight. Andrew expected it; Neil finally caved and allowed Allison to cut his hair this week, so his startling blue eyes are back on full display. The azure shirt Andrew picked out probably does not hurt, either.\nThe redhead down the bar who keeps flicking shy glances in Neil\u2019s direction certainly does not seem to think so. Andrew intercepts one of her sidelong looks and fixes her with a cyanide stare until she blushes and averts her eyes.\nAndrew is not jealous. Neil still does not swing for anyone but him. That is not arrogance; it is a conclusion based on thorough assessment of all available evidence. But Neil \u2014 when outside the familiar territory of an Exy court \u2014 shrinks from strangers\u2019 attention like a vampire from sunlight. Andrew is not about to let some ill-conceived flirt ruin his good mood.\n\u201cAny day now, Neil,\u201d Andrew says, itching to get back to their booth, where he might be less tempted to order a second drink.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d Andrew swirls what remains of his spirit around the bottom of the glass. \u201cJust ask Roland to make something you\u2019ll like.\u201d\nNeil pulls a face, and Andrew feels the corner of his mouth twitch, despite himself. Hardly anyone is immune to Roland\u2019s stupid, cocky swagger, but Neil is aggressively one of them. It remains unclear to Andrew whether Neil dislikes Roland on the principle that Roland is the closest thing Andrew has to an ex, or whether Neil has not forgiven the handcuff incident. Either way, Andrew takes great pleasure in observing Neil\u2019s pettiness and Roland\u2019s futile attempts to win his favor.\nAs though summoned by the sheer power of Neil\u2019s legendary bad luck, Roland is the next available bartender at their end of the counter. He greets Neil with a broad grin and a, \u201cPick your poison yet?\u201d\nNeil takes one last, lingering glance at the menu before shoving it across the counter in defeat. \u201cMake me something good.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, a little bespoke bartending.\u201d Roland cracks his knuckles. \u201cAny preferences?\u201d\n\u201cStrong,\u201d Andrew says, because this is the last time tonight he stands at the bar for fifteen minutes straight. Neil stretches Andrew\u2019s patience beyond almost anyone else, but Andrew\u2019s temper is only so elastic.\nRoland grins. \u201cOn it. What about you?\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s eyes snag on a nearby flock of sorority sisters as they down a round of vodka shots in sync. He imagines that heat, like swallowing a lit match, burning behind his own sternum. Saliva fills his mouth, but he bites the inside of his cheek. He made a deal. He downs the rest of his drink and places his empty glass before Roland. \u201cA Coke.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\nRoland frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAndrew swipes his glass across the counter, making Roland lunge to keep it from sliding off. He of all people should remember how Andrew feels about repeating himself.\n\u201cOkay, okay, got it. Coke for you,\u201d Roland says, and prepares Andrew a glass of soda. \u201cThis is a first. You sick or something?\u201d\nAndrew considers telling him yes and coughing in his face. But Roland is more pleasantly useful to Andrew when they are on good terms, so Andrew says, \u201cDesignated driver.\u201d\nRoland affects an irritating expression of elaborate surprise. His eyes bounce from Andrew to Neil and back again, smile creeping back onto his face. \u201cWow, look at you, blondie,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a good boyfriend.\u201d\nAndrew is about to tell Roland exactly where he can shove his patronizing attitude, but Neil cuts in with, \u201cDon\u2019t call him that.\u201d\nRoland blinks. Andrew blinks.\n\u201c\u2026Blondie?\u201d Roland says.\n\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Neil says. \u201cI\u2019m not his boyfriend.\u201d\nIf Andrew were the kind of person to indulge in facial expressions, he might be wearing one a lot like Roland\u2019s right now: eyebrows raised, lips parted in silent surprise. As it is, Andrew inhales sharply at the hard kick of his heart, but the sound is swallowed by the noise of the club. When Roland\u2019s eyes cut back over to him, Andrew\u2019s face is studiously blank.\n\u201cOh, I thought \u2014 shit, man, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Roland tries on a sheepish smile under Neil\u2019s narrowed gaze. \u201cI keep putting my foot in my mouth around you, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Neil says, without forgiveness.\nAfter an awkward pause, Roland says, \u201cRight, uh, about that drink,\u201d and quickly fucks off to make Neil\u2019s cocktail, affording Andrew a moment to figure out what the hell just happened.\nTechnically, Neil is not Andrew\u2019s boyfriend. They have never applied a label to this\u2026 thing between them, and Andrew has always been comfortable in that liminal space. \"Boyfriend\"\u00a0would be an awkward fit for him and Neil \u2014 too loose in some ways, too constrictive in others.\nYet, Neil is not not Andrew\u2019s boyfriend, either. And Neil is the one always waxing on about how \u201cit\u2019s always yes with you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d His sharp rebuke now means something, and Andrew takes it like a knife between the ribs. The knife twists when Neil turns back to Andrew, appearing nothing but happy and relaxed, as though what he said was neither surprising nor important.\nThis is what you get, sneers a quiet, watchful voice from the back of Andrew\u2019s mind.\nAndrew chokes off that inner voice and focuses on maintaining his placid expression. But Neil must spot a hairline fracture in Andrew\u2019s composure, because his brow pinches. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d\nYou tell me.\nTo investigate, Andrew brushes the backs of his fingers against Neil\u2019s under the bar. \u201cYes or no?\u201d\nNeil\u2019s expression shifts from perplexed to pleased, and he nods. Andrew links their hands together and swipes his thumb across the familiar texture of scar tissue along Neil\u2019s knuckles. The ridges of knife slices and unnatural plastic smoothness of burns. A hand that could not be mistaken for anyone else\u2019s in the dark.\nNeil\u2019s exhale brushes Andrew\u2019s neck as Neil shuffles closer, tipping his forehead to rest against Andrew\u2019s temple. It is more openly affectionate than Sober Neil would typically be, but by all other accounts entirely normal, except \u2014\n\u201cWhat was that,\u201d Andrew says, in his most carefully indifferent voice.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Neil says, pulling back to look Andrew in the eye.\n\u201cWith Roland.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Neil sneers. \u201cToo harsh?\u201d\nAs if he does not know that the only thing Andrew enjoys more than being rude to people who annoy him is watching Neil be rude to people who annoy him.\n\u201cNeil,\u201d Andrew says, a traitorous strain sneaking into his voice, because \"not his boyfriend\"\u00a0is rattling around, horribly loud inside Andrew\u2019s head.\nNeil\u2019s smirk twists into something more rueful, sending another jolt through Andrew\u2019s stomach. Andrew grits his teeth, but then Neil says, \u201cI hate when he acts like he knows you,\u201d completely snapping the tight coil of tension inside Andrew.\n\u201c...What.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Wow, look at Andrew, being a good boyfriend,\u2019\u201d Neil says in a mocking tone that sounds nothing like Roland, making clumsy air quotes with his free hand. \u201cAs if you could only possibly do something nice out of some sense of obligation.\u201d Neil snorts. \u201cHe can go fuck himself.\u201d\nAndrew stares at Neil. At his curled lip. At the tight draw of his shoulders. At the surly side-eye he aims down the bar. Andrew processes the fact that \"not his boyfriend\" was a middle finger to Roland, not to Andrew.\nHe rewinds the interaction in his mind and replays it in slow motion, viewed from this new angle. Neil\u2019s inflection, his expression. \"Not his boyfriend.\" To fuck with Roland.\nAndrew hates himself for the rush of cold relief that floods his stomach.\nRoland reappears behind the counter to present a supremely unimpressed Neil with his custom drink. \u201cA Roland Shoemaker original,\u201d he says proudly.\n\u201cDoes it have a name?\u201d Neil says, as if he could name even five standard mixed drinks off the top of his head.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Roland says. \u201cOne-of-a-kind. You could call it the Neil Josten.\u201d He gives Neil a flattering wink.\nNeil does not look flattered.\nRoland sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly Fireball. You\u2019ll like it, I promise.\u201d\nNeil takes a dubious sniff and then sips his beverage. He wrinkles his nose. Andrew takes that to mean the drink is stiff, as requested.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Roland says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Neil says, and takes a longer sip.\nRoland looks ready to hang that two-star review on his home refrigerator.\n\u201cBut is it better than any of the house cocktails?\u201d Neil muses, aiming a sly look at Andrew. \u201cMaybe I should have another look at the menu \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI will gut you,\u201d Andrew promises.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Neil says, with obnoxious confidence. \u201cThen Jack would be promoted to starting striker. Imagine how unbearable he\u2019d be then.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect excuse to gut him, too.\u201d\n\u201cKevin wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\u201cFuck Kevin.\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Neil says, with something horrifyingly close to genuine intrigue.\nAndrew plants a hand on Neil\u2019s cheek to turn his face away. \u201cGo sit down.\u201d\nNeil peels Andrew\u2019s hand off with a laugh. \u201cI have to pay for my drink,\u201d he says, and fumbles for the wad of bills he carries at all times. Despite his newly minted status as a Real Person, Neil Josten still refuses to register for a credit card or use the savings account Wymack forced him to set up in May.\n\u201cI said sit,\u201d Andrew says, smacking Neil\u2019s hand away from his pocket and shoving him in the direction of their booth.\nNeil, for once in his goddamn life, does as he is told.\nAndrew wipes a hand down his face and turns back to the bar, regretting for the twelfth time tonight his agreement not to drink. \u201cYou can put that on Nicky\u2019s tab,\u201d Andrew tells Roland, who is watching Neil\u2019s retreating form with a keen eye. Andrew considers slashing Roland\u2019s tires on their way out.\n\u201cIs that really not official yet?\u201d Roland says, waving a forefinger between Neil\u2019s back and Andrew\u2019s chest.\n\u201cIs that really any of your business?\u201d\n\u201cIt could be,\u201d Roland says archly.\nDefinitely slashing his tires.\n\u201cNot if you want to live to see twenty-five,\u201d Andrew says, but Roland just smiles.\nThe problem with spending time around other people, Andrew has found, is that those who can tolerate Andrew\u2019s company for longer than five minutes tend to build up the kind of emotional scar tissue that makes cutting remarks less effective.\nAndrew decides that he is ignoring Roland, effective immediately, and imagines the satisfying sink-punch of a blade puncturing rubber all the way back to their booth.\nThe only Fox left at the table with Neil is Aaron, who slides out with a scowl as soon as Andrew slides in. Andrew bids him a middle finger\u2019s farewell, which Neil mimics. Roland\u2019s signature Neil Josten drink is already half-empty on the table in front of its namesake. Andrew can smell the other half on Neil\u2019s breath. Especially when Neil leans in to practically shout over the music, \u201cYes or no?\u201d\nAndrew makes a mental note to put ASL on their languages-to-learn list after Russian and nods. Despite Neil\u2019s utter lack of context clues, Andrew knows what he wants. As expected, Neil\u2019s hand finds Andrew\u2019s under the table again and he scoots closer to lay his head on Andrew\u2019s shoulder. After a moment, Andrew rests his cheek in Neil\u2019s hair and feels Neil unwind against him. Soft and settled and for once taking no pains to scout the club for threats.\nNeil only ever drops his guard this far while drunk \u2014 which is entirely the point. Neil told Andrew as much, the morning after he allowed Nicky to get him really, thoroughly trashed for the first time, while curled up in a miserable ball against the toilet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow would you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause how anticlimactic would it be,\u201d Andrew said, \u201cif this were how you died. Think about it.\u201d\n\n\nNeil did. At least, Andrew assumed Neil was thinking, until it turned out he was really just working himself up to puke again. \n\n\nWhen he was finished, Andrew wiped Neil\u2019s mouth with a paper towel before Neil could wipe it on the sleeve of Andrew\u2019s stolen hoodie.\n\n\u201cGive me a truth,\u201d Andrew said, because it was his turn in their game of swapping honesties. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d For all Neil drank, these days, he did not get drunk. \n\nThere was a long pause, during which Andrew wondered whether the next thing out of Neil\u2019s mouth would be an answer or more vomit. \n\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what it would be like,\u201d Neil said at length, \u201cto not be able to worry about watching my back or looking for exits or \u2014 or anything, for once. And I knew I could, because you would be there. I\u2019m always safe with you.\u201d \n\nIt was right up there with \u201cnot if it means losing you\u201d and \u201cI want to go back for you.\u201d The kind of thing Andrew knew by the way Neil curled into him in bed or sought out Andrew\u2019s eyes in a crowd, but was still unsettling to hear aloud. Nothing had prepared Andrew for the intoxicating power and awful helplessness of being Neil\u2019s \u2014 whatever Andrew was, to Neil. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it,\u201d was all Andrew could say.\n\n\n\u201cI never will,\u201d Neil said.\n\nAnd fuck, if Andrew doesn\u2019t know he will never get used to it, either \u2014 the easy way he can hook his ankle around Neil\u2019s and feel Neil hide a smile in his shoulder. Comfortable closeness is still such a foreign sensation that Andrew cannot quite settle into it.\nAt the same time, this feels like the only natural order of things: Neil and Andrew alone together, backs to the wall, Neil trusting Andrew to guard against the world. Here, it is easier to see \"not his boyfriend\" as the casual fuck-you to Roland that it was. Easier for Andrew to believe that Neil covets the nameless thing between them just as much as he does.\nBy the time Neil does the honors of slashing Roland\u2019s tires on the way out of Eden\u2019s Twilight, Andrew has all but put the incident behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2\n\nThe second time it happens, Andrew again assumes Neil is fucking around.\nAndrew maintains that this is a valid go-to assumption, where Neil Josten is concerned, as Neil does a great many things just to be difficult. Clog toilets with expensive attire, for instance. Shit talk Exy stars with notoriously rabid fans on national television. Politely suggest, again on national television, that the Exy-founding idol of said rabid fans should resign from coaching in shame.\nAnd that is just off the top of Andrew\u2019s head.\nConservatively, ten percent of everything Neil has ever done was fueled only by pure, high-octane spite. And when it comes to Aaron, that figure is something more like ninety percent.\nIt happens like this.\nAndrew and Neil are watching Exy, because Neil stole the remote and Andrew is not in the mood to wrest it back. Andrew sits on the couch, Neil on the floor, cheek pillowed on Andrew\u2019s knee.\nThis has become their default position when they are both having bad days \u2014 a compromise between Neil\u2019s need for closeness and Andrew\u2019s need for space. Some days, Andrew combs a hand through Neil\u2019s hair. Today, though, the thought of someone else\u2019s hair tangled between Andrew\u2019s fingers is unbearable. Ever since Andrew woke at five a.m. in a rigid, sweaty tremble, his whole body has felt as hypersensitive as the sticky skin of his forearms when he peels off his armbands at night.\nAndrew has gotten better, he thinks, at not making a bad day worse by hating himself for having the bad day in the first place. But returning from errands to find Neil in the suite's common room, pale and twitchy, and rejecting Neil\u2019s request for a hand, a hug, anything \u2014 Andrew did hate himself a little for that. And then hated Neil for putting him in that position. And then agreed to watch TV because the mindless distraction might halt his mental spiral before it drilled too deep.\nAndrew actively hates both himself and Neil all over again when he glances down and catches Neil picking at his scars. If Neil were in his usual spot at Andrew\u2019s side, Andrew could smack Neil\u2019s hands apart. As they are, Andrew can only nudge Neil\u2019s head with his knee. \u201cStop.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose,\u201d Neil snaps, shoving his hands under his thighs and glaring off to the side.\nAndrew knows he isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the problem.\nAndrew has not figured out whether this is a new anxious tic, or an old one exacerbated by Neil\u2019s new expanses of exposed scar tissue. But Neil scratches and bites at the marks Lola left on him like they're still scabs, as though he could peel the scars off to uncover smooth skin underneath. It is a disgusting habit, and Andrew is tired of donating all his Band-Aids and Neosporin to Neil\u2019s fraying nerves.\nAnother day, Andrew would hold Neil\u2019s hands still with his own.\nIt is good to remind himself that there will be other days.\nNeil turns his face into Andrew\u2019s knee and hooks a hand around Andrew\u2019s ankle. Neil is not having a panic attack, exactly, but he is a master of the silent implosion. It is only a matter of time before he is back to picking at himself. Andrew considers purchasing a pair of gloves to make Neil wear, like a dog in a cone, or investing in a set of fidget spinners. For now, though \u2014\n\u201cMove,\u201d Andrew says, jostling Neil with his knee again to make him sit up.\nNeil leans forward to let Andrew off the couch, looking confused and a little hurt, like he thinks Andrew is about to leave him alone. Idiot.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\nAndrew does not answer, because he wants Neil to sit still until he gets back, and anticipation is one of the few ways to hold Neil\u2019s attention. Predictably, Neil cranes his neck to watch Andrew disappear into Aaron and Nicky\u2019s room, where Andrew retrieves the Rubik\u2019s cube from the junk drawer in Aaron\u2019s beside table. Back in the sitting room, Andrew chucks the Rubik\u2019s cube at Neil, who plucks it from the air with irritating ease.\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Neil,\u201d Andrew sighs, reclaiming his place on the couch. \u201cI refuse to believe that you grew up so far off the grid that you don't even know what a Rubik\u2019s cube is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m watching the game,\u201d Neil says, and tosses the Rubik\u2019s cube into Andrew\u2019s lap. \u201cYou do it.\u201d\n\u201cYou were giving yourself new scar tissue,\u201d Andrew corrects, dropping the Rubik\u2019s cube to the floor beside Neil, \u201cand I already know how.\u201d\n\u201cReally.\u201d\nAndrew knows when he is being baited, but he also knows the quickest way to end this conversation. He holds out his hand, and Neil places the Rubik\u2019s cube in his waiting palm. Andrew turns the toy over to assess its current state and starts twisting panels.\nHe looked up a YouTube tutorial on how to solve the puzzle the same afternoon Aaron brought it home, to piss him off. Andrew has never forgotten the solution, and Aaron has never figured it out \u2014 or that Andrew cheated. If they didn\u2019t share the same face, Andrew would swear he and Aaron were not related.\nA few minutes later, Andrew holds the solved puzzle up long enough to commit Neil\u2019s expression of surprised admiration to his mental library of favorite Neil faces. Then he mixes the Rubik\u2019s cube up again and drops it into Neil\u2019s lap. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you give me for it?\u201d Neil says, forever difficult.\nAndrew sighs. He considers. \u201cOne movie night.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\nAndrew looks at him seriously.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching \u201880s rom-coms this week,\u201d Neil warns.\nAndrew is aware. Nicky spent their last drive back from Columbia explaining in great detail the film curriculum he planned for their summer movie nights to improve Neil\u2019s nearly nonexistent knowledge of popular culture.\nAndrew has not, actually, detested the few team movie nights he has attended under duress. If he must spend time with the Foxes, two hours during which they are all focused on something else and no one tries to talk to Andrew is practically ideal. But Neil still labors under the impression that Andrew loathes them, which makes them valuable bargaining chips.\n\u201cWhat are you watching next?\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s called The Breakfast Club?\u201d Neil looks dubious. Then he hitches on a smirk. \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s Ten Things I Hate About You. That sounds more on-brand for you.\u201d\nThe slang sounds as clunky as a Russian phrase coming from Neil, who is clearly spending too much time around Allison. Andrew plants a hand on the side of Neil\u2019s smirking face to turn it away. He feels Neil snicker under his palm.\n\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cTo The Breakfast Club,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cAnd show some damn respect. That is a classic.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d\nAndrew has lived with Nicky for over three years. He has seen all of them. Not entirely against his will, but Andrew will take his fondness for the colorful theater of Clueless to his grave.\n\u201cYou see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, and the most convenient definitions,\u201d Andrew deadpans, and watches the reference sail right over Neil\u2019s head. \u201cYes, Neil. Do we have a deal?\u201d\nNeil responds by turning back around to face the TV and setting into the puzzle. Andrew rests a hand on the top of Neil\u2019s head for as long a moment as he can bear before swiping the remote off the floor and switching the channel to Antiques Roadshow.\nIt is a rerun of a 2001 episode Andrew knows well. The roadshow client nods politely as the appraiser explains the history of his Navajo blanket. In a few minutes, he will learn the blanket is worth half a million dollars.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you like this show,\u201d Neil says. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be able to use any of this information.\u201d\nBee would probably have a few things to say about why Andrew derives pleasure from a show about overlooked and abandoned secondhand items getting appraised for small fortunes. But not everything is about trauma.\n\u201cSome people like knowing things for the sake of knowing them, Neil.\u201d\n\u201cI know things.\u201d\n\u201cThings that are not about Exy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nYeah, Neil knows things. Things like how long it takes to bleed out from gunshot wounds to different parts of the body. Not things like the odd historical facts Andrew collects and neatly arranges on the shelves of his memory like Bee\u2019s glass knick-knacks.\n\u201cWell, if you shut up and listen, you might learn a few new things,\u201d Andrew says, and turns up the volume.\nNeil shuts up, but Andrew doubts he is listening. Andrew can see him chewing his cheek and making one rookie mistake after another, screwing the Rubik\u2019s cube up worse than Andrew originally scrambled it. Neil occasionally emits soft grumbles of frustration, but otherwise works quietly. He does not pick at his scars.\nAndrew cruises through six Antiques Roadshow reruns and Neil succeeds in piecing together the green side of the Rubik\u2019s cube before Nicky and Aaron upset the fragile peace of the living room.\n\u201cHoney, we\u2019re home,\u201d Nicky sing-songs as he bangs open the door.\nNeil flinches badly enough to drop the Rubik\u2019s cube. Andrew puts a hand on the back of his neck and glares at Nicky, who is too busy kicking off shoes and dropping bags to notice.\n\u201cAre you watching that antiques show?\u201d Aaron says, raising an eyebrow far too judgmentally for all the hours of reality TV bullshit he binges with Katelyn.\n\u201cTrying to,\u201d Andrew says pointedly.\n\u201cBut\u2026 there\u2019s an Exy game on,\u201d Nicky says. He leans around the couch to peer at Neil, as if checking it really is him on the floor.\n\u201cNeil is busy,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cIs that my Rubik\u2019s cube?\u201d Aaron says.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Neil says absently, working on the red side now, at the expense of completely fucking up the green. \u201cAndrew found it.\u201d\nAaron snatches the Rubik\u2019s cube out of Neil\u2019s hands.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYou messed up all my progress,\u201d Aaron snaps.\n\u201cWhat progress,\u201d Andrew says.\nAaron rounds on him. \u201cYou can\u2019t just steal my shit and give it to your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing I\u2019m not his boyfriend, then,\u201d Neil sneers, and yanks the Rubik\u2019s cube out of Aaron\u2019s hand.\nAndrew knows \u2014 he knows this is Neil\u2019s knee-jerk response to contradict anything out of Aaron\u2019s mouth. A throwaway comment that should have no effect on Andrew. But that logic does not preempt the bolt of electric tension that shoots through Andrew\u2019s limbs, undoing all the work of his progressive muscle relaxation exercises today.\nFucking \u2014 fuck.\nAndrew inhales, exhales. It is a bad day. This response is not proportional. Andrew opens and closes his fists. He is capable of controlling his reaction. If there is one thing Andrew is good at, it is packing undesired emotions into boxes and putting them away, in a back corner of his brain, to unpack with Bee later or ignore entirely. But it is easier to do alone.\nAndrew extricates himself from the couch while Neil and Aaron continue to bicker over the goddamn Rubik\u2019s cube and allows the door to slam on Nicky\u2019s call after him.\nUp on the roof, the air is heavy with humidity. A low ceiling of black clouds threatens thunder. The concrete beneath Andrew\u2019s bare feet is damp from the afternoon shower, so Andrew removes his sweatshirt to make a seat for himself before sitting at the roof\u2019s edge. He lights a cigarette and looks down at the slick pavement below, gleaming like a blade in the streetlamp light.\nThree cigarettes later, just as it starts to rain, Andrew hears the door open behind him. No footsteps follow.\nAndrew considers telling Neil no. He is not particularly keen on company, even \u2014 or perhaps especially \u2014 Neil\u2019s. But he is calm enough now that Neil\u2019s presence will not actively pose a problem, and Neil is wading through the end of his own bad day. Better to keep him here, where Andrew can see him, than to wonder whether Neil is off finding or making trouble on his own.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew says, just loud enough for Neil to hear him over the soft applause of rain against the roof.\nMoments later, Neil is beside Andrew, just plopping down on the wet cement like a goddamn \u2014 whatever. Honestly? Whatever. Andrew cannot summon the energy for indignation over Neil\u2019s utter inattention to the most basic of bodily comforts.\nNeil hooks his hands over the edge of the roof and kicks his feet restlessly, throwing Andrew sideways glances. He is clearly not certain of his place here, despite Andrew\u2019s yes. Andrew sighs and offers Neil a cigarette. Neil accepts the peace offering and cups a hand over the end to protect the flame of Andrew\u2019s lighter from the drizzle as he lights it. Andrew takes the opportunity to inspect the dark hollows beneath Neil\u2019s eyes, thrown into sharper contrast by the small orange glow of the flame.\nNeil has been off for a few days. Eating and sleeping even less than usual. Clinging to Andrew\u2019s sleeves and sticking his hands in Andrew\u2019s sweatshirt pockets, the way he only does when he is too anxiously itchy for comfort to wait for a yes-or-no on skin contact. Something brought all this to a head this afternoon, although Andrew does not know what. His mental calendar of Neil\u2019s past traumas is blank for today.\nAndrew does not ask. The rest of the team is constantly wheedling Neil to talk about it on days like this, but Andrew knows better. He knows how hard Neil works to stay grounded as Neil on days like this. Pestering him with questions about Nathaniel Wesninski will not help.\nSo Andrew sits and smokes and waits. His shirt is nearly soaked through by the time Neil says, \u201cSorry we interrupted your show.\u201d\nAndrew contemplates setting the record straight on what made him leave, but decides against it. Neil did not mean anything by his comment, and Andrew should not have thought anything of it. Tomorrow, Andrew will think nothing of it. Probably. This is merely the side effect of a bad day. It means nothing and it does not matter.\nThings that do matter: Neil\u2019s hunched shoulders, the restless knock of his heels against the side of the building, and the new red scratches across the back of his hands. Andrew does not feel guilty about leaving Neil alone inside; he did what had to be done. But he is with Neil now.\n\u201cForget it,\u201d Andrew says, replacing the stub of Neil\u2019s first cigarette with a second. \u201cIf you must talk, talk about something else.\u201d\nHe watches how Neil\u2019s cheeks hollow on the inhale, how he arches his neck to breathe smoke into the sky. After the exhale, Neil keeps his head tilted back, apparently unbothered by the rain hitting his face. He looks contemplative, and Andrew wonders whether Neil will tell him what is wrong with today.\nInstead, Neil says, \u201cThis is my favorite kind of weather.\u201d\nAndrew wipes a raindrop out of his eye. \u201cYou have shit taste in weather,\u201d he says.\nNeil blows an amused exhale through his nose. \u201cNot this, exactly,\u201d he says, waving his cigarette carelessly through the drizzle. He points to the distance, where the first flashes of lightning are pummeling through the fat, purple clouds. \u201cSummer thunderstorms.\u201d\nThis information does not seem to beg a response, so Andrew does not give it one.\n\u201cWhen I was little, I used to be afraid of lightning,\u201d Neil says, which does get Andrew\u2019s full attention. Not the words, but the tone. Neil\u2019s childhood left him precious little to feel nostalgic about, but Neil\u2019s voice now sounds almost wistful.\nAndrew hmms to indicate that Neil should continue.\n\u201cMy mom told me that lightning wasn\u2019t scary, it was cool, because it was created by superheroes fighting up in the sky.\u201d\nIt is the first quasi-normal thing Neil has ever told Andrew about his mother. To be frank, Andrew is shocked that Mary Hatford did not simply try to beat the fear of thunderstorms out of Neil, the way she tried to beat so much else out of him.\nAndrew has vivid, viscerally satisfying daydreams about giving Neil\u2019s mother the same sendoff he gave his own.\n\u201cSounds like you were an especially gullible child,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cHard to imagine, given your current borderline-psychotic levels of paranoia.\u201d\nNeil grins. \u201cGive me a break. I was like, five.\u201d\nAndrew thinks about all the childish naivet\u00e9 he had dispelled by the tender age of five, and cannot suppress a sneer. \u201cMommy\u2019s little lie worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nNeil does not see the ugly expression on Andrew\u2019s face. He is staring out at the dark campus, distant and considering. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d He shrugs and shoves his damp hair out of his face, all traces of reverie gone. \u201cMaybe I just learned there were more important things to be afraid of.\u201d\nNeil rubs his hand absently against the shoulder marked with the outline of a hot iron. Andrew knows the scar well. He has dragged his lips over it and felt Neil\u2019s shuddery breath beneath him.\nAndrew\u2019s life is not short on horrors. He does not need Neil\u2019s compounding his own. But he would be lying if he said it did not help, sometimes, to be reminded that he and Neil are fucked up in equal if opposite ways.\n\u201cNightmare?\u201d Andrew guesses, inclining his head toward Neil\u2019s shoulder.\nNeil shakes his head. \u201cGuy in front of me in the lunch line smelled like the detergent my mom used for laundry that day.\u201d He snorts. \u201cHow stupid is that?\u201d\nAndrew, who knows well what it is like to get yanked back in time by the scent of a very specific cleaning solution, says, \u201cIt is not stupid.\u201d\nThe self-deprecating smile slides off Neil\u2019s face. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey smoke in silence for several minutes before Neil says, \u201cWhat about you? Nightmare?\u201d\nNeil must know that it was. He knows what it means to wake up alone, with Andrew back in his own bed. But Andrew recognizes the question for its invitation, if Andrew wants to talk.\nAndrew does not want to talk. But he does nod, to at least nominally answer Neil\u2019s question. This is how it works. Truths for truths.\nThe rain continues apace. \u201cWant to go for a drive?\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\nThe answer Andrew expects is \u201cwherever.\u201d The answer he gets is, \u201cThe dollar store.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cAaron took his Rubik\u2019s cube back and locked himself in his room.\u201d\nAndrew is surrounded by children.\n\u201cAre you telling me that at \u2014 \u201d Andrew checks his phone. \u201c \u2014 nine-thirty on a Sunday night, we need to find a Dollar General to buy you a new Rubik\u2019s cube.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cAt nine-thirty,\u201d Andrew repeats, \u201con a Sunday night.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll run to the store myself if you don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Neil says.\nAndrew might let him, if he did not know Neil means \u201crun\u201d literally. He sighs. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says, stubs out his cigarette, and stands. Neil follows. \u201cYou really can hyper-fixate on anything, can\u2019t you? Junkie.\u201d\nNeil scrunches up his face. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the Rubik\u2019s cube.\u201d To Andrew\u2019s arched eyebrow, \u201cBeyond shoving it in Aaron\u2019s face when I solve it, I mean. But you can\u2019t call some eighties teen movie \u2018a classic\u2019 and then expect me to watch it without you.\u201d\nA complicated tangle of emotion knots up in Andrew\u2019s chest as he looks at Neil \u2014 the only person who might respect the sanctity of a deal as much as Andrew does. He is struck with the urge to yank Neil in by his shirt for a bruising kiss. Andrew does not do this, because they are not kissing-in-the-rain kinds of people, and today is not a kissing kind of day. But he imagines it.\n\u201cStaring,\u201d Neil says, smug.\nAndrew reaches out to dig his thumb into the dimple on Neil\u2019s left cheek. \u201cOne hundred and thirteen.\u201d\nNeil grins wider, the way he always does when Andrew is being a dick. Not the way Roland would smile, like he thought Andrew was being a tease, or playing hard to get. Neil smiles like he takes comfort in the consistency of Andrew\u2019s attitude. It is a strange acceptance that, like most things about Neil, Andrew did not ask for and does not know how to handle \u2014 yet wants to hold as long as he can. One careless \"not his boyfriend\"\u00a0is nothing in the face of that ridiculous smile.\nAndrew is not in the business of hoping for much, but when Neil looks like this, Andrew can almost believe that, for once, he might be allowed to keep a good thing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3\n\nAndrew should have known that no optimistic thought would go unpunished.\nOnce is an anomaly, twice a coincidence, thrice a pattern. And the third time, there is no ambiguity about whether Neil is fucking around.\nThe funny thing \u2014 well, not funny, but the thing that would definitely have sent Andrew into a fit of manic laughter, if he were still on his meds \u2014 is that the blow lands right after the most ostensibly together thing Andrew and Neil have ever done.\nFor the Fourth of July long weekend, they finally make good on Neil\u2019s desire to go someplace for the sake of going, doubling Neil\u2019s specified three-hour radius on a trip to Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens. A sufficiently long and touristy journey that by the time they return, Neil will no longer be able to say he has never been on a summer vacation.\nThe night before they leave, Neil is about his usual business of keeping Andrew awake after the lights are out. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Neil murmurs into the dark. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cEcstatic,\u201d Andrew deadpans, even though there is a not-unpleasant tug behind his sternum that could be construed as excitement. Andrew has a lot of these kinds of feelings around Neil: small buds of emotion, like new leaves poking through a bed of ash. Andrew tries not to examine them too carefully without Bee\u2019s expertise on hand.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Neil says, which should be the end of that \u2014 except that Neil\u2019s slow, uncertain tone tells Andrew it is not. Andrew is lying flat on his back, eyes closed, but he can feel Neil\u2019s gaze burning into the side of his face.\nAndrew waits what he considers to be a very generous ten seconds for Neil to say what he needs to say. When Neil does not, Andrew succumbs to a sigh and turns on his side.\nNeil is, as usual, curled up in as close to a fetal position as he can get with Andrew taking up half his bed. Andrew watches Neil twist the strings of his hoodie \u2014 Andrew\u2019s hoodie \u2014 between his fingers. After a space, Neil says, \u201cThree days is a long time.\u201d\nThis is an absurd statement, coming from someone who spent most of his childhood on one extended road trip from hell. But Andrew keeps his mouth shut, because it is clear where Neil is headed with this, and the sooner he gets there the sooner Andrew sleeps.\nNeil pulls the sleeves of Andrew\u2019s sweatshirt down over his knuckles. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not gonna get sick of me?\u201d He\u2019s smirking, but his posture is bowstring tight.\nIt is not the first time that Neil has said something to this effect. For someone who has fought so long and so hard to survive, Neil sure has a lot of second, third, and fourth thoughts about whether he is worth keeping around \u2014 in any other capacity than being a world-class striker, that is.\nIf Andrew were someone else, he would say that Neil is the only person in the world whose company he would even consider subjecting himself to for seventy-two hours straight. But, being only himself, all Andrew can do is lay his hand out on the mattress between them, palm up. Neil\u2019s grip is immediate and desperately tight. Andrew brings Neil\u2019s knuckles up to his lips. \u201cI cannot possibly get any sicker of you than I already am,\u201d he promises.\nIt is enough to coax a genuine smile out of Neil. It is also, more importantly, true. For all Neil\u2019s irritating and sometimes infuriating qualities, Andrew\u2019s \u2014 ugh \u2014 feelings about Neil have only trended toward more intrigued and more attached ever since the day they met, defying all explanation and Andrew\u2019s best efforts to the contrary.\nOf course, there are moments on their holiday weekend that put that trend to the test. Prime among them is Neil\u2019s insistence on wearing a fanny pack.\nAndrew understands that indulging in frivolous tourism is all part of the exotic, normal-person experience that Neil is seeking. Which is why Andrew is prepared to suffer through three sweaty days surrounded by noisy children and high-strung parents, slogging through long lines and conversations with employees who refuse to break character. All this, Andrew will abide for the sake of giving Neil Josten one goddamn pleasant memory that does not involve Exy.\nWhat Andrew cannot abide is Neil becoming the kind of normal person who wears a fanny pack.\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing it ironically,\u201d Neil says as he buckles the bright orange atrocity around his waist. \u201cAm I using that word right?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Andrew says.\nNeil wears the fanny pack anyway, using it to tote his flip phone and a cheap digital camera he bought for the trip. Despite Nicky\u2019s continued lobbying for Neil to buy a smartphone, Neil refuses on the grounds that \u201ciPhones spy on people.\u201d And while Andrew finds most of Neil\u2019s holdover habits from pre-Fox life somewhere on the spectrum from unnecessary to unhealthy, this is one point where he will concede that Neil is probably on to something.\nColonial Williamsburg is, essentially, pleasant. Neil leaves with a snow globe, a pack of Stroopwafels, and a horrific sunburn. Busch Gardens has bigger crowds, which is decidedly less pleasant. Neil handles crowds poorly, especially since Binghamton. He hugs close to Andrew\u2019s shoulder whenever they pass particularly large packs of people. As they stand in line for Neil\u2019s first roller coaster, which Andrew will not be riding, Neil practically tries to hide behind Andrew while side-eyeing a nearby knot of loud school kids.\n\u201cRelax, Neil,\u201d Andrew says, already tired of this hovering, because it is only ten in the morning and already over ninety degrees and Andrew needs space to breathe. \u201cNone of those fifth graders is going to shank you for the front seat.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Neil says darkly. \u201cThe last fifth grader I met was Riko Moriyama.\u201d\nThere are too many absurd premises in that statement for Andrew to unpack and sort out now, especially when he can feel the midmorning sun burning the back of his neck and the beginnings of a headache stabbing his right eye. \u201cYou trust me to protect you from the fucking yakuza, but not a pack of school children?\u201d Andrew says.\nNeil, either completely missing or completely ignoring Andrew\u2019s deep sarcasm, looks slightly mollified.\nAndrew spends the day eating ice cream and watching Neil chase adrenaline highs on increasingly tall rides. He spends the evening eating Neil\u2019s Stroopwafels and watching Neil flip through his photos. Neil is an astonishingly horrible photographer. Most of his photos \u2014 of rides, random strangers, the fucking sky \u2014 are crooked or blurry or both. Neither Andrew nor Neil is in any of them.\nAndrew wonders whether Neil is doing that on purpose \u2014 leaving the camera devoid of any clues about its owner, in case it gets lost or stolen \u2014 or whether Neil truly does not understand the purpose of vacation photos. Maybe, to him, snapping over-saturated shots of the parking lot is more about the normal-person theater of taking photos than actually documenting shared memories.\nUltimately, it does not matter to Andrew either way. What are eidetic memories for.\nThe queen-size bed crammed into their tiny motel room is nice. The sheets are scratchy and the pillows are flat, but there is much more space to be together without being on top of each other than in a twin bed. This is especially important when their tiny motel room AC turns out to be broken.\n(This was Andrew\u2019s fault for trusting Neil to make their reservations; apparently, despite the small fortune stashed under his bed at home, it did not occur to Neil to book anything nicer than a Super 8. Having witnessed the horror that is Neil\u2019s wardrobe, Andrew should have guessed that life on the run left Neil frugal to a fault in all ways, but. Lessons learned.)\nBy midnight, Andrew and Neil have shifted from sitting shoulder-to-shoulder against the headboard to lying face-to-face, and are locked in a silent game of chicken over who is going to turn out the light. Andrew suspects this means they will fall asleep with it on, but he does not mind. Sleeping with the light on is a gone but not forgotten childhood habit.\nNeil doesn\u2019t look as though he particularly minds, either. He is blinking heavily, and his hand is more lying atop Andrew\u2019s than actually holding it. With the fucked-up side of his face buried in his pillow and his shower-damp hair falling into his face, Neil looks young \u2014 much younger in this loose, happy, relaxed state than he did when Andrew found him last year. Loose, happy, relaxed, in spite of everything that has happened since last year.\nLoose, happy, relaxed here with Andrew.\n\u201cGive me a truth,\u201d Neil says. \u201cDid you have fun this weekend?\u201d\nAs usual, the simple yes-or-no question has no simple yes-or-no answer. Andrew does not experience fun the way he thinks most people do \u2014 the way sheer delight brought a savage grin to Neil\u2019s face as he ran from ride to ride across the park today. All Andrew\u2019s most recent recollections of that kind of pleasure were episodes of medication-induced glee. He could go his whole life without feeling like that again.\nWhat Andrew did feel this weekend was the security of having Neil with him, somewhere safe. Relief that Neil does seem humanly capable of finding some kind of happiness beyond the confines of an Exy court. Satisfaction that Andrew was the one to give him that. Contentment to lie in a mediocre motel bed and watch Neil fall asleep.\nAll that, Andrew thinks, amounts to a \u201cYes.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s fingers lace into Andrew\u2019s, his face overtaken by a smile that gives Andrew an unnamed emotion that seems too big for his body.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Neil says. \u201cCoulda done without the crowds, though.\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d Andrew says, with particular care to keep his voice level, because the big feeling refuses to recede. \u201cThis is brand new information.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s smile wanes. \u201cSorry. Was I too much?\u201d\nYou are always too much. \u201cNo,\u201d Andrew says, and raises his free hand to Neil\u2019s cheek. After Neil\u2019s nod of assent, Andrew cups the side of his face and uses his thumb to smooth back the hair at Neil\u2019s temple.\nNeil\u2019s eyes slip shut. He clutches Andrew\u2019s hand tighter and scoots closer until their foreheads touch. Andrew slides his hand to the back of Neil\u2019s neck and squeezes to wring a soft, happy noise out of Neil.\nNeil is ridiculously easy to please with small affections. Andrew did not need the revelation of Neil\u2019s entire tragic backstory in Baltimore to know that Neil had rarely, if ever, been handled with care. And it is insane that the first person permitted to touch Neil like this should be Andrew. But here Andrew is, being trusted to protect Neil \u2014 not by standing between Neil and something else, but just by being close and careful. Andrew wants to earn that trust, the way Neil has slowly been earning Andrew\u2019s.\nWanting, in Andrew\u2019s experience, is a dangerous, often painful, almost always unrewarding thing. Wanting Neil was one of the worst ideas Andrew ever had. But as Neil tucks his head under Andrew\u2019s chin and allows Andrew to bury his nose in Neil\u2019s hair, Andrew is starting to think he might just get away with it.\nThe other shoe drops when they return to campus on Monday night.\nThe rest of the Foxes, save the freshmen, have apparently spent the Fourth drinking, throwing a rained-out barbecue in Andrew\u2019s living room, and drinking some more. There is an Exy game playing in the background of their loud conversations, but only Kevin is paying the least bit of attention.\nNicky and Matt hail their arrival with happy whoops that make Neil flinch. Andrew returns their greetings with a dead stare and nudges Neil toward the open spot beside Renee before Nicky can navigate the minefield of paper plates and beer cans on the floor to cage Neil into a hug.\n\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Renee says with a gentle smile as Neil sinks onto the couch. \u201cGood weekend?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Neil says. \u201cI took a bunch of photos. Wanna see?\u201d\nAndrew suspects this is more of Neil going through the motions of normal post-vacation behavior, but he does not comment, because (1) why interrupt the blue-moon rarity of Neil volunteering information about his life, and (2) Renee is the probably only person in the world who would not judge Neil\u2019s abysmal photography skills.\nAndrew carries Neil\u2019s bag and his own into their room and deposits them by the bed. He is considering simply shutting his door and trying to fall asleep despite the noise when Nicky\u2019s voice catches his attention.\n\u201cHey, Neil. Now that you\u2019re back, settle a bet for us, would you?\u201d\nSomething about Nicky\u2019s coy tone kindles Andrew's suspicion. He returns to the doorway and leans against it, arms crossed.\nNeil, cheap camera on his lap and wary expression on his face, has the entire room\u2019s attention. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhen did you and Andrew get together?\u201d Nicky says. \u201cNot just hooking up, but like, together together.\u201d\nAndrew feels the whole room lean forward. Everyone must have something in the pool on this one. Everyone who can, anyway. And even though Andrew is not among them, he finds himself curious about Neil\u2019s answer.\nAs far as Andrew is concerned, he could not have made it more official with Neil than performing the grand romantic gesture of shattering Riko Moriyama\u2019s wrist on live television. He might as well have proposed to Neil on ESPN, for fuck\u2019s sake. The whole affair would have been horribly embarrassing, if it had not been so satisfying or so necessary.\nBut Neil was the one who called \u201cnot nothing\u201d weeks before Andrew stopped arguing against it, so his date might be slightly \u2014\n\u201cWe\u2019re not together.\u201d\nNicky scoffs. \u201cC\u2019mon, if I wanted a bullshit answer, I would\u2019ve asked him.\u201d He jerks his chin in Andrew\u2019s direction, but Andrew does not react. Cannot react. He might be permanently calcified in this exact position against the doorframe.\n\u201cI\u2019m not bullshitting you,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Nicky says, stretching out the word with disbelief. \u201cJust two bros, chilling in a one-bed motel room, zero feet apart \u2018cause they\u2019re not gay.\u201d\nNeil makes the same face Matt does whenever the cousins start speaking German. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nNicky looks to Matt for support. Matt shrugs and says, \u201cDunno why you\u2019re looking at me. I\u2019ve never pried an honest answer out of that kid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d Neil says, tone inching toward anger.\n\u201cSure you are, babe,\u201d Allison says.\n\u201cI am,\u201d Neil says, definitely angry now.\nThe Foxes obviously don\u2019t believe him. But Neil \u2014 Neil obviously believes every word he\u2019s saying.\nAndrew can hardly breathe around the noxious feeling simmering under his skin, roiling in his chest, rising like bile in his throat. He needs to get out. He needs to get out now.\nBut he can\u2019t. Not without drawing attention. He can already feel Renee\u2019s eyes on him. Andrew hates her for that. Hates Nicky for his question. Hates Neil for his answer. Hates all of them for being in his fucking home right now, forcing Andrew to contain all this ugliness neatly inside himself.\nIt is Neil, ironically, who gives Andrew his out.\n\u201cThink whatever you want, I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d he grumbles, and shrugs out from under the hand that Renee tries to lay on his shoulder as he heads for the door \u2014 without looking at Andrew. \u201cI\u2019m going to the court.\u201d\nKevin, despite his current BAC, perks up like a dog who\u2019s heard the word \u201cwalk.\u201d But he only makes it to a brief standing position before swaying back onto the couch. By the time he figures out what he wants to shout at Neil about practicing footwork, the suite door has already slammed shut.\n\u201c\u2026Too far?\u201d Matt asks the oddly quiet room left in Neil\u2019s wake.\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and gambling,\u201d Nicky says, despite the somewhat guilty look he aims at the door. \u201cI want my two hundred. Erik\u2019s birthday is coming up.\u201d\nMatt raises an eyebrow at Andrew. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to be any more forthcoming on this?\u201d\nNo, Andrew doesn\u2019t suppose he is. But he swallows a retort, because if Andrew opens his mouth right now, he\u2019ll \u2014 what? Yell? Be sick? Cry?\nAndrew has not cried since Cass. Funny how this betrayal feels so much like that. Funny how Andrew always expected it, but somehow also didn\u2019t.\nWithout answering Matt or looking at anyone else, Andrew exits the suite as if to follow Neil. But instead of taking the elevator down to catch him in the lobby, Andrew takes the stairs up to the roof, where he strides straight to the edge and leans forward just enough to send a cascade of adrenaline through his stomach. He stumbles back with a knifelike inhale and, sufficiently shocked back to clarity, sinks to his knees to breathe through the aftermath.\nHe hasn\u2019t needed to do that in a while. But it works like a charm \u2014 like screaming into a pillow, stepping under a cold shower, or opening a seam along his wrist \u2014 to relieve some of the toxicity inside him, if only temporarily. Once Andrew gets a cigarette lit in his shaking hands, he lies back on the roof and waits for nicotine calm to permeate his body.\nThe door opens. Andrew closes his eyes and is about to tell Neil no when Renee\u2019s voice says, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\nAndrew opens his eyes and tips his head back to study Renee\u2019s upside-down outline in the doorway. He always suspected Renee knew about the roof and was just allowing Andrew to keep it for himself.\nWhen Andrew does not immediately tell her to fuck off, Renee comes to lie beside him.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be babysitting?\u201d Andrew says, privately relieved that he has his voice back.\n\u201cAaron has mostly sobered up,\u201d Renee says pleasantly. \u201cI trust he will not allow anyone to do anything too foolish in my absence.\u201d In his peripheral vision, Andrew sees Renee turn her head to look at him. \u201cBut I can go back downstairs, if you like.\u201d\nAndrew knows she will. Renee never pushes. Not like Neil, with his fucking \u201cI\u2019m not a pipe dream\u201d and \u201cI want to come back for you.\u201d Like any of that ever mattered, when \u201cwe\u2019re not together.\u201d\n\u201cYou can stay,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Renee crosses one ankle over the other, pillows her head on one hand, and ushers in a silence.\nAndrew knows it won\u2019t last. But Renee grants him the span of two cigarettes, and Andrew is well on his way back to numbness, before she says, \u201cWould you like to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cDo I ever?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, and politely leaves the \u201cbut sometimes you do anyway\u201d unsaid.\nThe thing about apathy is that it takes work. Andrew has put a lot of goddamn time and care into feeling as little as possible. Survival skills take practice. But sometimes, especially when it comes to a feeling as untenable as the one Andrew is trying to wrangle now, affecting apathy is too exhausting. And sometimes \u2014 sometimes \u2014 talking to Renee helps. She usually ends up doing most of the talking anyway.\n\u201cNeil,\u201d Andrew says, and inhales smoke to suffocate a vengeful upsurge of the bad feeling.\n\u201cHis answer to Nicky\u2019s question.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou were surprised,\u201d Renee guesses.\nAndrew clenches and unclenches a fist. \u201cI should not have been.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nAndrew tries not to let the question irritate him into leaving. He sighs, sits up, and stamps out his cigarette on the concrete between them. For all their similar history, \u201cThere are some things I cannot make you understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Renee says again. It is the kind of gentle antagonism that Andrew usually only has to endure in sessions with Bee, and it strains Andrew\u2019s brittle patience.\n\u201cBecause you were eventually chosen.\u201d\nRenee does not react to the venom of Andrew\u2019s accusation. She looks thoughtful for a moment. \u201cHave you considered the possibility that Neil has chosen you, but he believes you have not chosen him?\u201d\nAndrew does not have the words to answer that. Even if he did, he is not sure he would trust himself to speak.\n\u201cWhat I mean is,\u201d Renee says, \u201chave you and Neil ever explicitly discussed the nature of your relationship? Have you told him what you want?\u201d\n\u201cNeil knows what I want,\u201d Andrew snaps. This is not Andrew\u2019s fault.\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nBecause Neil always knows. He is as fluent in Andrew\u2019s micro-expressions as he is in German and French. He understands which head tilts mean \u201cgo on\u201d and which ones mean \u201cshut up.\u201d Without ever asking, he has learned what it means to see Andrew wearing double layers of long sleeves, or taking multiple showers in the same day, and knows to hand Andrew the keys to the Maserati.\nThat has always been the most terrifying thing about Neil \u2014 his patience to wait, watch, listen, learn. The prospect that if Neil were given enough time, there would be no part of Andrew that was just Andrew\u2019s anymore.\n\u201cHe has to know,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cDoes he?\u201d Renee says. \u201cHave you ever known Neil to assume that he is wanted?\u201d\nNo, but Andrew has not said \u201cthis is nothing\u201d since before Baltimore. Even then, it was obvious that Neil did not buy it. Neil has a state-of-the-art bullshit detector. (Not, as Neil likes to claim, because he was raised by criminals, but by virtue of being such a relentless bullshitter himself.) Of course Neil saw through Andrew\u2019s guise of disinterest, even in the spring.\nSince then, there have been movies in bed. Midnight drives to nowhere. Literal long walks on the fucking beach. Neil cannot possibly believe that he and Andrew are just fuck buddies \u2014 not least because the vast majority of their non-platonic interactions would, to Andrew\u2019s chagrin, qualify as cuddling.\nAndrew could fuck somebody and honestly call it nothing. He could not regularly coax Neil down from panic attacks, share Neil\u2019s clothing just because it is lying around, or promise to guard Neil\u2019s life with his own and have it mean nothing. That is not sentimentality. That is just logic. And not even Neil, for all his social ineptitudes, could be blind to it.\n\u201cHe has to know,\u201d Andrew repeats.\nRenee, endlessly agreeable, nods and leaves it alone.\nThey stay on the roof for nearly an hour, but by the time Andrew returns to the suite, Neil is still not back. The rest of the remaining Foxes are passed out across furniture and the floor.\nAndrew contemplates what to do about Neil as the hot water of his shower bites into his back. He thought he was prepared for this inevitable loss. But Andrew realizes now that he only ever braced for the possibilities of Neil leaving or being taken away. He was not ready to navigate a weird middle ground where Neil stayed and appeared to want Andrew, but not as much \u2014 not enough for how Andrew wanted him. This is completely unexpected territory. Andrew needs time and space to plot his next move.\nHe gets neither. Andrew has just changed into sleepwear and climbed into his bed when Neil returns from the court, shirtless and sweaty from the jog home \u2014 looking better than he has any right to, when Andrew is so angry at him.\nSeriously, fuck everything about today.\n\u201cYou are a mess,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cWhat else is new,\u201d Neil quips.\n\u201cYou walking around half-naked, apparently,\u201d Andrew says, staunchly ignoring the tug of desire low in his belly.\nNeil has the decency to look abashed. \u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s still almost ninety degrees out there, and campus was dead, so.\u201d He rubs the back of his neck, looking doubtful now. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone saw, but \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI am sure that if anyone did, they were more shocked by the sight of a man jogging at midnight than the appearance of your bare torso,\u201d Andrew says. Which is not strictly true, because Neil\u2019s bare torso is a pretty shocking sight to behold, and Andrew has seen some pretty shocking shit in his life. But even amid his bitterness and anger, Andrew has zero tolerance for the goddamn self-loathing look that Neil gets whenever he talks about his body.\n\u201cGo shower, junkie,\u201d Andrew says, to spare both of them the further torture of dwelling on Neil\u2019s shirtlessness.\nNeil goes, and comes back ten minutes later wearing a pair of offensively orange sweatpants and one of Andrew\u2019s t-shirts. Andrew averts his eyes before he can have an emotion about it. He hears Neil crawl into his own bed and wriggle around to get settled before he says, \u201cYes or no?\u201d\nAndrew cuts his eyes over to Neil, looking soft and sleepy, and Andrew is tempted. It requires every iota of his self-control to say, \u201cNo.\u201d\nNormally, this is where Neil would shrug and wish Andrew good night, because he knows how to take a no. Neil always knows.\nNow, though, Neil\u2019s smile slips, and his brow furrows. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nHe does not preface it with \u201cgive me a truth,\u201d so technically, Andrew is not beholden to honesty \u2014 if he is beholden to anything with Neil, anymore. If he ever was, beyond his original oath to keep Neil alive.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew lies.\n\u201cLiar,\u201d Neil says, because he knows better, and right now Andrew isn\u2019t sure which one of them he resents more for letting that happen.\n\u201cTakes one to know one,\u201d Andrew says, because maybe by falling back on the childish retorts he used to keep Neil at arm\u2019s length last year, he can reclaim some of that safe distance.\n\u201cYup,\u201d Neil says, and waits. When Andrew says nothing, Neil says, quieter, \u201cIs it about us?\u201d\nSince there seems no point denying it now, Andrew lies back and looks at the ceiling. \u201cYes.\u201d\nNeil goes very, very quiet now, and Andrew finds himself holding his breath to hear if Neil is breathing. At length, Neil says, \u201cAbout what Nicky said.\u201d\nIn a manner of speaking. \u201cYes.\u201d\nNeil is eerily still for another several seconds, then sits up. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cIf you\u2019re mad about that, take it up with Nicky. I haven\u2019t been going around telling people we\u2019re together. I wouldn\u2019t do that to you, and you should know better than to think I would.\u201d\nAndrew stares at the vicious loyalty on Neil\u2019s face. He knows that expression well. He committed it to memory, the first time Neil snapped at Allison to quit calling Andrew a monster. And again when Jack wondered aloud how Andrew stayed on the team when he made so little effort. And again when another thoughtless freshman asked about Aaron\u2019s trial.\nThis is Neil\u2019s protective face. Neil believes he is guarding Andrew from people thinking they are together. Guarding Andrew\u2019s say in the matter, as though Neil doesn\u2019t have one at all.\nAndrew hates when Renee is right, especially about things Andrew should have figured out for himself. Because it was right there, if Andrew had only been looking: In the way Neil said \u201cit\u2019s fine if you hate me\u201d right before their first kiss. In Neil subjecting himself to torture to keep his father\u2019s men away from the Foxes. In the fretful twitching of Neil\u2019s hands as he knelt on a grimy hotel room floor and asked for Andrew\u2019s permission to stay, like he did not know that the entire time he was missing, Andrew felt as though something soft and sensitive and vital had been gouged out of him.\nSuddenly, Andrew needs Neil close. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says, and extends an arm when Neil hesitates. Neil slides out of his bed and into Andrew\u2019s, leaving the usual space between them. Andrew presses a hand to his own chest to demonstrate his intent, ignoring his wildly thumping heart, and says, \u201cYes or no?\u201d\nNeil nods once, quick and jerky, and crawls into Andrew\u2019s arms. Andrew rolls onto his back to pull Neil on top of him and tucks the comforter around Neil\u2019s shoulders. Neil\u2019s head rests against Andrew\u2019s chest and his fingers curl into Andrew\u2019s shirt. Andrew keeps one arm looped around Neil\u2019s waist and tangles the fingers of his other hand into Neil\u2019s hair. Neil gives a full-body shudder and presses closer.\nAndrew never imagined that someone else\u2019s weight on top of him could be tolerable, let alone comfortable. But with Neil, it is\u00a0 \u2014 nice. The layers of clothing help. But mostly, it is the fact that with Neil, Andrew is holding on, rather than being held down.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone anything,\u201d Neil mutters against Andrew\u2019s collarbone, quiet but defiant.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Andrew says. He should have known, because Neil is not used to being chosen, either. Neil is used to caring about things that will never care about him back: A mother who treated him as nothing more than an object to hoard. A sport that will cost him his life if he fails to perform. Andrew, who told him point-blank that he was nothing and they were nothing.\nSure, Neil knew better than \u201cthis is nothing,\u201d but he never made any assumptions about what the something was. And it was Andrew's mistake for assuming otherwise, when he knows that Neil Josten is as good as vapor \u2014 flighty and elusive and always taking up exactly as much space as he is allowed.\n\u201cTruth,\u201d Neil demands, shifting to prop his chin on Andrew\u2019s sternum to look him in the eye. \u201cAre we okay?\u201d\nNo, Andrew is beginning to see exactly how not okay they are. But Andrew considers himself something of an expert in the field of solving Neil Josten-related problems. \u201cWe will be,\u201d he says. \u201cNow sleep, junkie.\u201d Andrew needs time and silence to think.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4\n\nAndrew knows how someone like Nicky would recommend solving his problem. Not because Andrew has ever sought Nicky\u2019s counsel a day in his life, but because he has been on the receiving end of so much unsolicited advice from his cousin over the years that Nicky\u2019s obnoxiously encouraging voice enters Andrew\u2019s mind, unbidden: \u201cJust ask him out!\u201d\nThat plan, based on the false premise that Andrew is capable of asking for things, is so absurd that Andrew is annoyed that Nicky would even hypothetically suggest it.\nWith Neil, Andrew has never had to ask. Andrew demands his share of yes-or-no\u2019s, but primarily for things Neil is practically guaranteed to give: To make out with Neil in the back of the Maserati. To run his hands over Neil\u2019s slick skin in the shower. To loop an arm around Neil\u2019s waist and press his nose against the soft skin behind Neil\u2019s ear in bed.\nAndrew will never stop asking. But, Neil being the touch-hungry wreck that he is, these things are basically gimmes.\nFor the big things \u2014 the moments when Andrew has not been able to easily guess Neil\u2019s response in advance \u2014 Andrew has never had to ask. He has merely had to broadcast his intentions clearly and wait for Neil to catch on. (Andrew still cannot believe he ever had to be as clear as \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t blow you,\u201d but Neil can be slow on the uptake.)\nAndrew decides to employ the same strategy here. And what clearer way to signal \u201cwe are dating\u201d than to take Neil on a date.\nThey have never been on a date. Like using the word \"boyfriend,\" going on a date has always seemed... unnaturally normal for the likes of them. Besides, listening to someone recount most of his life story to FBI agents renders small talk over appetizers somewhat superfluous, if you ask Andrew.\nBut if this is what it takes to get it through Neil\u2019s thick fucking skull that he and Andrew are together, then this is what Andrew will do.\n\u201cI want to go someplace,\u201d Andrew tells Neil, the Saturday afternoon after they return from Virginia. Andrew is smoking out the bedroom window while Neil works on his new five-by-five Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\u201cGo someplace?\u201d Neil says, twisting one side of the Rubik\u2019s cube, considering, and twisting it back. \u201cWhere? And why?\u201d\nNeil thinks it\u2019s cute to throw Andrew\u2019s own words back in his face. It is not.\n\u201cOut. For dinner.\u201d\nNeil checks the time on his shitty flip phone. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\u201cNo, dumbass. At dinnertime.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, where?\u201d\n\u201cWherever you want.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\nNeil never does \u2014 not for team lunches, not for Nicky\u2019s newly reinstated family dinners, not for late-night takeout with Andrew on the couch. But Neil eats the most when they order from Rasika, and kissing Neil after he\u2019s put away a cartoon of pork vindaloo is like kissing fire, so Andrew says, \u201cIndian.\u201d\nDespite his claimed indifference, Neil looks pleased. \u201cSeven?\u201d\n\u201cSeven,\u201d Andrew agrees.\n\u201cCool,\u201d Neil says. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s stomach flips. \u201cYes,\u201d he says significantly, \u201cit is.\u201d\n\u201cCool,\u201d Neil says, with no indication he has caught Andrew\u2019s meaning.\nAndrew sighs and stands.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cShopping.\u201d\nNormally, Andrew would send Nicky on an errand like this, but Andrew does not care to explain Neil\u2019s sudden need for new clothing.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you own nothing close to dress-casual.\u201d\n\u201cSince when do we need to dress for curbside pickup?\u201d\n\u201cSince we\u2019re not taking it to go.\u201d\nNeil looks surprised. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cProblem?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Neil rakes a hand through his hair. \u201cI just haven\u2019t been to a restaurant nicer than Sweetie\u2019s in\u2026\u201d\nNeil\u2019s expression goes darkly distant in a way that Andrew has come to associate with Nathaniel Wesninski. Andrew nudges Neil\u2019s hands to remind him of the Rubik\u2019s cube.\nNeil flips one side of the puzzle back and forth absently. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d\n\u201cAn hour. Maybe two.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go for a run now, then.\u201d\n\u201cNeil.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Neil says. Like the real-feel outside is not nearly 105 right now.\nAndrew pinches the bridge of his nose, debates whether this is a debate worth having, and decides not. \u201cTake a fucking water bottle.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cAnd stay on Perimeter Road.\u201d Neil is prone to nearly giving himself heat stroke by running further than intended. At least if he is running in a circle, there is only so far he can get from air conditioning.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Neil says, even though he will almost certainly forget as soon as he is outside. Neil seems to enter some sort of meditative state when he runs.\n(He doesn\u2019t even listen to anything. And people call Andrew a psychopath.)\n\u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d Andrew says. That is really all he is asking for, here.\nNeil rolls his eyes. \u201cI promise not to die before you get back.\u201d\nThat promise does not mean much, coming from someone who has actively courted death on so many occasions, but Andrew lets it go.\nNeil does not die before Andrew gets back. He does look good in the clothes Andrew brings.\nLeft to his own devices, Neil still dresses like a vagabond. But he has at least stopped protesting whenever Andrew shoves a new shopping bag into his hands. He trusts Andrew to choose things that will cover most of his scars, which is Neil\u2019s only real stipulation when it comes to his attire.\nBut Andrew can tell Neil likes wearing what he picks out. At Eden\u2019s Twilight, Neil\u2019s posture is a little more relaxed. Shoulders pulled a little further back. A little less like he is trying to disappear.\nNeil adopts the same casual, more confident stance now as he eyes his new blazer in the bedroom mirror, which Andrew recently rehung on a hook too short for Neil to make eye contact with his reflection. (This was not as big a favor as Neil made it out to be, since the lost inches have inconvenienced only Kevin. Win-win.)\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Neil says, and Andrew has to look away from his intensely grateful expression.\nAndrew is starting to hate \u201cthank you\u201d from Neil as much as he hates \u201cplease\u201d from anyone else.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\u201cYou made a reservation?\u201d\n\u201cThat is what civilized people do,\u201d Andrew says. Civilized people. Normal people. Who do this very normal thing that he and Neil are about to do. Andrew tugs at the stiff collar of his shirt. The things he does for Neil fucking Josten.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d Neil says on the elevator ride downstairs.\n\u201cAstute,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\u201cImpulse.\u201d\nNeil, of all people, cannot argue with that.\nIn the parking lot, Andrew opens the passenger door for Neil. Neil looks from the open door to Andrew. \u201cAm I driving?\u201d\nAndrew will never forgive himself for getting involved with someone so oblivious. \u201cNo. Get in.\u201d\nNeil gets in.\nThey listen to a Russian language CD on the drive, because Neil cues it up out of habit and Andrew cannot think of a good reason to turn it off. It gives him time to think, anyway.\nAndrew feels none of the nervousness or excitement he supposes other people feel on first dates. Maybe he would, if he and Neil were two very different people undertaking this rite of passage under very different circumstances. Maybe he would, if Andrew were at all convinced Neil had a fucking clue what was going on.\nAndrew makes his next attempt to clarify matters on their way into the restaurant, letting his pinky catch on Neil\u2019s to request his hand. Neil gives it without hesitation, but his expression is bemused. They do not hold hands in public \u2014 or even much around Fox Tower, because Nicky is a sentimental dipshit without the survival instincts to control his cooing. Andrew responds to Neil\u2019s raised eyebrows with a challenging eyebrow of his own. Neil grins and squeezes Andrew\u2019s hand twice in quick succession.\nAnother perk of calling the restaurant ahead: specifically requesting that one table set into the bay window beside the door. When a corner booth that allows both of them to sit with their backs to the wall is not an option, a nearby exit is the next best thing.\nAs the waitress pours their water, Neil eyes the tablecloth, the candle, the small arrangement of succulents on the windowsill. \u201cThis is weird,\u201d he says as soon as the waitress leaves.\n\u201cBad weird?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Neil plucks at the cuffs of his crisp new shirt. \u201cJust weird. I feel like a dog wearing glasses.\u201d\nThat is, Andrew thinks, exactly what this feels like. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cThe winter banquet is way fancier.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s for Exy.\u201d\n\u201cAlways about Exy, with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought it up.\u201d\n\u201cTell me something good,\u201d Andrew says, to preempt further Exy-related conversation.\nThis is a new part of their bartering system. Neil undoubtedly has many more deep, dark secrets than he revealed to the FBI, but Andrew is not interested in trading for them. At least, not right now. He knows enough. He also knows that Neil will reveal the most important things of his own accord, in the car on a bad day, or in the dark after a nightmare.\nThe shiny new facts about Neil that Andrew collects now are the memories that would not otherwise come up in conversation. Neil lived dozens of lives between Baltimore and Millport, and Andrew knows that not every moment of that eight-year period was spent in a car chase. Andrew wants to know what else Neil was doing the rest of the time.\nThis summer, Andrew has met several of Neil\u2019s past selves. He knows Victor\u2019s favorite gelato shop in Milan. John\u2019s running route along the Charles River. Daniel\u2019s fondness for the cramped third-floor room he and his mother rented in the saltbox house on the coast of Maine. These trivial facts simultaneously make Neil seem more tangible and more elusive than ever.\nAndrew waits to see what Neil will offer up tonight, as Neil\u2019s eyes pan thoughtfully around the restaurant, across the table, out the window, and finally come to rest on the succulents. Something about their delicate geometry must jog his memory, because Neil says, \u201cHave I told you about the bonsai artist who rented the apartment below ours in Raleigh?\u201d\nHe has not. And so Neil describes for Andrew the jungle of miniaturized trees crammed into Mr. Kimura\u2019s tiny apartment, which Neil explored while cat-sitting.\n\u201cYour mother,\u201d Andrew says dubiously, \u201clet you enter a stranger\u2019s apartment alone.\u201d\n\u201cOnly while he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Neil says. \u201cI think she hoped it would make me shut up about adopting a cat of our own.\u201d\n\u201cNeil,\u201d Andrew says, exasperated at the sheer incongruence of him \u2014 how he manages to be the most thoughtless overthinker Andrew has ever met. \u201cNot even you could have thought that was a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Neil admits. \u201cBut it would\u2019ve been nice to have a friend.\u201d\nThat does something strange and unwelcome to Andrew\u2019s stomach, and he is grateful for the waitress\u2019s interruption to take their orders.\nOnce they are alone again, Neil knocks Andrew\u2019s ankle with his own. \u201cYour turn. Good thing, go.\u201d\n\u201cPick a number,\u201d Andrew says. For all his perfect recall, Andrew has more difficulty pulling up good memories on demand. Specificity helps. Neil knows which numbers to avoid.\n\u201cSeven,\u201d Neil says.\nAndrew opens his mental file on Home No. 7 and flips through: A gravel road and bunk beds. Basketball hoop over the garage and his foster brother\u2019s sour body odor. Breakfast for dinner and shouting downstairs after lights out. Andrew was almost relieved when they sent him away for \u2014\n\u201cCamp,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cWhat kind of camp?\u201d\n\u201cBoy Scouts.\u201d\nNeil is shocked and delighted. \u201cYou were a Boy Scout?\u201d\n\u201cBriefly.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\u201cWhen have I ever.\u201d\nNeil slumps back in his seat, acclimating to this new information. \u201cAll right, what was so great about Boy Scout camp?\u201d\nThe best thing about being at Boy Scout camp was not being somewhere else. It was fine, Andrew supposed, learning celestial navigation and fire-starting and other so-called survival skills. Not that any of those ever mattered, where Andrew\u2019s own survival was concerned. Where the real danger was Andrew\u2019s desire to unzip himself from his own filthy skin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to use knives,\u201d Andrew says, surprising himself with the memory. He has not thought about that in a long time.\n\u201cFor hunting?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory. In practice, mostly wood-carving.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you whittle.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nAndrew shrugs. There was an inflection point, when knives became weapons rather than instruments, and that is all they have ever been since.\n\u201cBut you remember how,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\u201cCould you teach me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m running out of Rubik\u2019s cubes.\u201d\nSo Neil thinks. He hasn\u2019t seen the Rubik\u2019s tetrahedron Andrew is waiting to drop on him as soon as he finishes the five-by-five.\n\u201cAnd it would be fun,\u201d Neil adds.\n\u201cWould it.\u201d Andrew cannot fathom what he might have done to give Neil the impression he would make a good, let alone fun teacher.\n\u201cMore fun than lessons with Lola,\u201d Neil says.\nThe joke lands incorrectly. Painfully.\n\u201cMore fun than lessons with the predatory pseudo-aunt who tortured you,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d\nNeil winces. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d\nAndrew knows he didn\u2019t. And of all the things Andrew does not want to do on their first date, fighting with Neil and thinking about Lola Malcolm are both high on the list. Andrew sighs. \u201cWhat would you teach me in return for whittling?\u201d\nA smart-aleck smile spreads across Neil\u2019s face. \u201cWell, there are a few Raven drills \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cNeil.\u201d The door is right there. Andrew will leave.\nNeil keeps grinning, immensely pleased with himself. \u201cOkay, okay. Um. I could teach you some French.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I want to learn French,\u201d Andrew says, \u201cwhen Kevin knows French.\u201d That was the whole point of Russian.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to tell Kevin that you know French,\u201d Neil says, his smile gone devious now.\nOnly the arrival of their food prevents Andrew from grabbing Neil by his fancy new collar and dragging him across the table for a kiss.\nThe evening is shockingly normal, by first date standards. Exchanging childhood stories, check. Swapping hobbies, done. Future plans, made. By the time they are waiting for the check, Andrew is almost ready to chalk the night up as a win.\nThat\u2019s when the girl approaches \u2014 a short brunette with a PSU sweater that Andrew recognizes from the tutoring center. She looks wary, which Andrew approves of, but eager, which he does not. She offers a tentative smile to Andrew\u2019s blank stare before directing her attention to Neil.\nNeil must have seen her coming the second Andrew did, but he does not acknowledge the stranger until she is standing over their table, unavoidable. Neil\u2019s foot finds Andrew\u2019s under the table.\nAnd here is another incongruence of Neil Josten: how he gives no ground to reporters or FBI agents, yet shrinks from fellow students like they might throw heavy, perhaps sharp objects at him. After a few days of being assaulted with congratulations over championships, Neil holed up in Fox Tower and refused to leave for anything but exams until the rest of the student body was gone for the summer.\n\u201cHi,\u201d the girl says, dialing her smile up to full brightness for Neil, whose foot digs painfully into Andrew\u2019s. Andrew kicks it off and presses his own foot over Neil\u2019s.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Neil says.\nAndrew says nothing, but the girl is not looking at him anyway.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Neil Josten, right?\u201d she says.\nNeil frowns. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Marta.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nMarta blinks, wrong-footed, but forges on. \u201cCongratulations on spring championships.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou had an amazing season.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cHigh bar to set for yourself, freshman year.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean to imply you had,\u201d Marta says, eyes going wide. \u201cOnly that you play really well for a freshman.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Neil says, clearly not sure whether to feel complimented or insulted.\nAndrew heard about some girl\u2019s ill-fated attempt to flirt with Neil last winter, but he has never gotten to witness the glorious catastrophe of it in-person. It would be amusing, if the interruption were not so unwelcome.\n\u201cYour switch to backliner in the second half of the final match was incredible,\u201d Marta says, a little desperately now \u2014 and finally Neil shows some slight interest in the conversation.\n\u201cThat was Andrew\u2019s idea,\u201d he says, on the verge of a smile.\nWhich finally gets Marta to acknowledge Andrew. \u201cThat was really clever,\u201d she says. \u201cUsing Neil\u2019s speed as a weapon for defense.\u201d\n\u201cDo you play?\u201d Neil says, his mildly interested tone souring what was left of Andrew\u2019s mildly good mood.\nMarta blushes and runs a hand through her hair. \u201cNo. Actually, my friend had to coach me on what to say before I came over.\u201d She laughs, light and gently self-deprecating.\nNeil, who would not recognize flirtation if it cracked him in the ribs with an Exy racquet, looks baffled. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nMarta\u2019s blush deepens. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to make a fool of myself.\u201d She tucks her hair behind her ears. \u201cMy brothers played little league, but your final was the first match I\u2019d seen in a while.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Neil says, and Andrew watches him mentally file Marta away among the majority of PSU that never gave a damn about their small, scrappy Exy team until it defeated the Ravens.\n\u201cMaybe you could teach me about it sometime,\u201d Marta says. \u201cOver drinks? We were going to go over to Blackjack after dinner, if you want to join.\u201d\nAndrew stiffens. Neil\u2019s eyes cut over to him briefly before returning to Marta. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in the middle of something,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYou could meet us there,\u201d Marta suggests.\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Neil says. \u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\u201cSome other time, then? We could meet for coffee or \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cHe said no,\u201d Andrew says, and startles when Neil\u2019s fingers catch his own. Andrew looks down and realizes he had been reaching for his armband. He and Neil stare at each other for a moment, until Marta claps her hands over her mouth.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says, staring at their linked fingers and turning redder than ever. \u201cI am so sorry. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n\u201cRealize what?\u201d Neil says.\nAndrew could kill him.\nMarta, looking like she regrets every life choice that ever led her to this table, says, \u201cThat you\u2019re together?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not together,\u201d Neil says.\nEven though Andrew expected them, the words still hit like ice water. He pulls his hand out of Neil\u2019s and crosses his arms.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Marta says slowly. \u201cSo, just to clarify, you\u2019re not going out with him, but you don\u2019t want to go out with me, either.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Neil says, looking immensely relieved that they are all finally on the same page.\nAndrew is definitely going to kill him.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Marta echoes. \u201cWell. Um. This has been more humiliating than I could have possibly imagined, so I\u2019m just going to...\u201d She turns on her heel for a hasty retreat without finishing her sentence.\nNeil watches her go with a perturbed expression, leaving Andrew to collect the bill from their waitress. Andrew pays it in cash so they can leave immediately.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Neil says on the way back to the car. He gestures to Andrew\u2019s armbands. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t some guy at Eden\u2019s Twilight trying to stick his hands down my pants.\u201d\nAndrew knows the difference. That is why Marta, unlike the handsy clubber, is going home with all her fingers intact. Andrew also knows better than to ignore someone ignoring a \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cI can look out for myself,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cI have yet to see any evidence of that.\u201d\nNeil smirks. \u201cBecause you\u2019re always looking out for me.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Andrew says.\nNeil goes quiet for a suspiciously long moment. When Andrew looks over, he catches Neil wearing a contented smile. It is so different from the sharp grin of satisfaction he wears after pulling off a play on the court. Smaller and softer in a way that does not quite fit his face. The sight of it touches Andrew like a feather-light brush against his skin \u2014 a sensation that demands to be scratched or slapped away.\n\u201cShut up with that look,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cYou like it.\u201d\n\u201cI hate it.\u201d At the very least, Andrew should not be forced to look at it right after watching someone else ask Neil out and Neil hitting him with another \u201cwe\u2019re not together.\u201d\n\u201cJust like you hate the rest of me,\u201d Neil says, apparently set on being annoying.\n\u201cJust like I hate the rest of you,\u201d Andrew confirms.\nNeil\u2019s smile widens.\n\u201cYou are impossible.\u201d Andrew clicks the unlock button on his key fob as they turn down the street where the Maserati is parked. \u201cThat girl has no idea the bullet she just dodged.\u201d\nNeil snorts. \u201cRight? Can you imagine what it would be like to date me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Neil,\u201d Andrew sighs. \u201cWhat would that be like.\u201d\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d Neil says, with sky-is-blue certainty. \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would ask me out.\u201d\n\u201cMust be your pretty face,\u201d Andrew says, which is closer to a real compliment than he means to give.\nNeil scoffs. \u201cSure.\u201d\nAndrew stops in front of the car to study Neil. \u201cYou disagree?\u201d\nNeil cocks his head to the side, like he\u2019s unsure whether Andrew is messing with him. \u201cUh, yeah? Despite my best efforts, I have actually looked in a mirror.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nNeil gives a stiff, defensive shrug. \u201cI guess I was probably fine to look at before.\u201d\n\u201cBefore Lola.\u201d\nNeil shrugs again and rubs a hand over the mottled skin of his cheek. \"I know the scars can\u2019t be pleasant to look at.\u201d\nNeil is right. They are not pleasant to look at. Neil\u2019s scars are a constant reminder of the gutting realization that Neil was taken. A constant invitation to imagine Neil, alone and scared and in pain.\nNeil\u2019s scars are fucking awful, but for none of the cosmetic reasons that Neil apparently imagines. It is not a lie when Andrew says, \u201cYou look fine.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Neil says. His wan smirk is so not Neil that Andrew wants to slap it off his face.\n\u201cAsk for a truth, if you don\u2019t believe me.\"\nNeil hesitates. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might think I look fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean.\u201d\n\u201cI mean you were the only one who saw my face right after Lola melted half of it off,\u201d Neil says, and Andrew violently shoves down the memory of soft tissue peeling back with bandages, exposing the delicate ooze. \u201cOf course this looks better than that,\u201d Neil says, with a flippant gesture at his face, \u201cno matter how ugly it \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Andrew says, chest tight with the furious, coiled need to do something. \u201cJust \u2014 shut up. Yes or no?\u201d\nNeil barely has time for a startled nod before Andrew shoves his back up against the Maserati.\nTheir first kiss was rough. Vicious. It was Andrew flashing poison-bright colors in a warning that Neil, of course, completely ignored. They have not kissed quite like that since. They do not often kiss with anger. They do kiss with urgency. Andrew kisses Neil urgently now, swallowing the soft \u201cmph\u201d that Neil makes on impact.\nAndrew holds Neil\u2019s face tightly between his hands, tracing his thumb along the periphery of scar tissue where Neil regains sensation. Neil emits a small, needy noise, his hands grasping at the hem of Andrew\u2019s jacket. Andrew takes Neil\u2019s wrist to guide his hand to Andrew\u2019s hip. \u201cOnly here,\u201d he murmurs into Neil\u2019s mouth. Neil gives a quick nod. Andrew bites at his bottom lip to elicit another pretty noise and a shiver before covering Neil\u2019s mouth with his own again.\nKissing Neil has always been a fluorescent thrill. But the touch is more electric, every nerve in Andrew\u2019s body aglow, when he kisses Neil to tell Neil something. Andrew cups the left side of Neil\u2019s face in one hand and wraps the other around the nape of Neil\u2019s neck. He tangles his fingers in Neil\u2019s hair and tightens his grip, savoring Neil\u2019s soft gasp and willing him to understand.\nWhen Andrew pulls back, hot and humming, he shifts his hands to press his thumbs under the juncture of Neil\u2019s jaw, against his pulse. A heavy thump beneath the pads of Andrew\u2019s fingers \u2014 irrefutable evidence that Neil Josten is right here, real and alive, in Andrew\u2019s hands. With kiss-swollen lips and flushed cheeks, breathing heavily and blinking at Andrew with that ridiculously open expression that overthrows Andrew every time.\nIf there were ever a moment for Andrew to force the words out \u2014 explain to Neil exactly what he is to Andrew, how real and alive it makes Andrew feel to hold Neil\u2019s heartbeat in his hands \u2014 this would be it. Standing in this dim side street that smells like damp fast-food and stale cigarettes, close enough to feel Neil\u2019s exhales and practically high on potential energy.\nBut the right words, if they exist, are somewhere unknown, deep inside Andrew, unreachable. Instead, Andrew says, \u201cNever say shit like that about yourself ever again.\u201d\nThe post-kiss glaze in Neil\u2019s eyes has cleared, and he stares at Andrew longer than Andrew would normally allow, before leaning in for one more quick kiss. \u201cOkay,\u201d Neil says, and steps around Andrew to get in the passenger side.\nFor tonight, Andrew will let that be enough.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\nIn the wake of the disastrous sort-of-date, Andrew allows himself one week to regroup before plotting his next move. In that time, Neil manages to get sick.\nAndrew\u2019s first thought is, who gets sick in the middle of July.\nThe second is, of course Neil would get sick in the middle of July, because Neil has never met a norm he did not immediately tell to go fuck itself.\nAnd the third is, it is actually more surprising that Neil has gone this long without getting sick. Even during the summer, Neil\u2019s meal and sleep schedules are absolute garbage. He hangs back after practice most days to work one-on-one with various freshmen and keeps up his night practices with Kevin \u2014 usually with another freshman in tow.\nFriday night, Neil brings Aisha to the court to teach her a few backliner drills of his own invention, while Kevin supervises and Andrew pretends not to watch from the stands. Neil keeps interrupting himself mid-sentence to cough, and he is not quite as quick on his feet as usual when he demonstrates a series of complicated footwork for Aisha. The freshman appears mildly concerned, but not enough to dare suggest they take a break. Kevin and Neil, meanwhile, appear to notice nothing.\nAnd why should they, Andrew thinks, after all the Raven practices they have both endured black and blue. But, like most problems that go unnoticed by Neil and Kevin\u2019s single shared brain cell, this one is obvious to anyone with a modicum of self-preservation.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting sick,\u201d Andrew says, after he is awoken on Saturday morning by Neil having a tremendous coughing fit over the side of the bed.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Neil says, and Andrew considers shoving him the rest of the way off. \u201cProbably just allergies.\u201d\n\u201cSince when do you have allergies.\u201d\nNeil, a coward, does not respond.\n\u201cYou are sick,\u201d Andrew says on Saturday night, flicking one of Neil\u2019s many used tissues at him across the table.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Neil says, through thick congestion.\nFine, Andrew thinks. Let him suffer.\n\u201cAre you done pretending that you\u2019re not sick,\u201d Andrew says, when he picks Neil up from the side of the road on Sunday afternoon.\nAndrew\u2019s aimless drive off campus was interrupted by a phone call from Nicky, reporting that a few soccer players had seen someone sitting on the curb on their way back to Fox Tower and assumed it was \u201cthat crazy striker who\u2019s always running.\u201d\nMaybe if Andrew tells Neil that his insane exercise routine has rendered him recognizable to strangers \u2014 even while sitting with his head between his knees, christ, Neil \u2014 then he will exercise some self-control.\n\u201c\u2019m not sick,\u201d Neil says, sliding into the passenger seat and slumping back with his eyes shut. \u201cJust got dizzy for a second.\u201d\nAndrew lightly smacks Neil\u2019s cheek to make him open his eyes and drink from a water bottle. While Neil is distracted, Andrew holds one hand against his forehead, but it is impossible to tell whether Neil\u2019s temperature is a consequence of fever or sitting outside in hundred-degree heat.\nAndrew pulls a shirt from the bag of Exy gear in his backseat to wipe Neil\u2019s sweat off his hand. \u201cYou should have called.\u201d\nNeil drains the entire water bottle and wipes his mouth on the sweat-drenched collar of his shirt. Andrew pushes his own spare shirt into Neil\u2019s hand. Neil wipes his face with it. \u201cDidn't want to bother you,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYou always bother me.\u201d\nNeil smiles weakly and accepts the second bottle of water that Andrew drops in his lap. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was fine.\u201d\nLast summer, Andrew would have mistaken that for a lie \u2014 or at the very least, false bravado. But Andrew knows now that after outrunning armed pursuers on a broken ankle, jogging with a summer cold is Neil\u2019s definition of fine. Neil could suffer any illness or injury and keep going because he has always had to, and he has no clue how to stop now that he can.\n\u201cOne thirty-six,\u201d Andrew intones. But it is possible that Neil, once again leaned back with his eyes closed, is already asleep.\nWhen they cross the threshold of the suite ten minutes later, Andrew nudges Neil toward the couch. \u201cSit.\u201d\nThe sound of Andrew\u2019s voice summons a fretful Nicky out of his bedroom. \u201cNeil,\u201d he says, making a beeline for Neil with outstretched hands \u2014 but stopping up short when Neil, still groggy from his brief nap in the car, flinches. Hurt flashes briefly across Nicky\u2019s face, but he masks it quickly with concern. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Neil says, drawing his shoulders up against the attention.\n\u201cHe almost fainted,\u201d Andrew says, which earns a gasp from Nicky and a glare from Neil, which Andrew ignores. If Neil does not want to worry people, he should not go around almost fainting. \u201cI said sit.\u201d\n\u201cI need to shower,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYou need to eat.\u201d\n\u201cI ate before running.\u201d\n\u201cReally. When.\u201d\nNeil is silent, either struggling to remember the honest answer or making up a lie.\n\u201cNeil,\u201d Nicky says again, with cloying pity.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Neil says, a sentiment immediately undercut by a wet, raspy hacking fit.\nWhen Neil emerges from his elbow, Andrew says, \u201cIf you\u2019re not sitting on the couch when I come back with soup, I\u2019ll tell Boyd you\u2019re sick.\u201d Andrew usually finds the upperclassmen\u2019s self-appointed roles as Neil\u2019s overbearing older siblings tiresome, but they can be useful. \u201cYou want another one of those around?\u201d Andrew adds, pointing at Nicky\u2019s literal hand-wringing.\nNeil glares, but he sits.\nAndrew turns to Nicky. \u201cMake sure he stays.\u201d\n\u201cOn it!\u201d Nicky says with a grin, flinging himself onto the couch beside Neil and crossing his ankles over Neil\u2019s lap.\nNicky keeps Neil trapped there until he has suffered through an entire bowl of chicken noodle soup, grumbling intermittently about how very fine he is while Andrew and Nicky ignore him. Andrew has an Exy game cued up when Neil returns from his shower to lure him back to the couch, but Andrew gets to change the channel back to Animal Planet less than five minutes later when Neil passes out, head tipped back and breathing loudly through his mouth.\nNicky lifts a hand toward Neil\u2019s shoulder, but stops at Andrew\u2019s sharp, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get a stiff neck, if he sleeps like that,\u201d Nicky says.\n\u201cAnd you are going to get a black eye, if you wake him up.\u201d\n\u201cGod, you guys are the same person.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you.\u201d\nIn truth, Andrew is more likely to hit Nicky than Neil is, if he wakes Neil up. Neil is more prone to fear than violence when he wakes up somewhere unexpected.\nAndrew digs a blanket out from behind his beanbag chair and throws it at Nicky. \u201cTell Aaron and Kevin to be quiet when they get home.\u201d\nNicky obediently drapes the blanket over Neil and texts the others while Andrew returns Neil\u2019s bowl to the kitchen sink and retrieves a thermometer from the medicine cabinet.\nNeil sleeps straight through three hour-long wildlife documentaries, during which Aaron and Kevin collect Nicky for dinner and Andrew takes Nicky\u2019s spot on the couch. In the middle of a special on lion pride dynamics, Andrew finally feels Neil stir \u2014 first with a few small twitches and soft noises, then with a violent jerk as he sits bolt upright.\n\u201cNeil.\u201d\nNeil whips his head around at the sound of Andrew\u2019s voice. His wild eyes land on Andrew\u2019s face, and Andrew sees the moment that recognition enters them. Neil\u2019s shoulders drop and he unclenches his fists from the blanket on his lap. He releases a shaky exhale and slumps back, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes. \u201cWhat time\u2019sit?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost eight.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Neil says from behind his hands, voice rough with sleep and a likely sore throat. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to sleep that long.\u201d\n\u201cSick people need sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d\nSometimes, Andrew regrets commenting on Neil\u2019s idiocy so often, because the words seem to have lost some of their punch when he says, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\nNeil, apparently with no defense against the truth, says nothing. He tips his head forward to massage the back of his neck.\n\u201cGo lie down,\u201d Andrew says.\nNeil scoffs. \u201cI just slept for three hours.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, sick people need sleep.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not sick.\u201d\nAndrew holds out the thermometer. \u201cProve it.\u201d\nNeil raises an eyebrow. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t have a fever, you\u2019ll leave me alone?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d says Andrew, who can practically feel the fever radiating off Neil.\nNeil sticks the thermometer under his tongue with a defiant \u201cjust you wait\u201d expression.\nAndrew waits to be proven right. He is, ten seconds later, by the thermometer\u2019s readout of 101.7.\n\u201cThat\u2019s like, barely a fever,\u201d Neil says, scowling down at the thermometer screen.\n\u201cFor someone who knows how to suture wounds and reset bones, you sure do lack a fundamental understanding of human health,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Neil grumbles. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel that sick.\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s irritation flares. Neil has so many vastly complicated problems, tangled up in mafia politics and the federal investigations thereof. A head cold? Not fucking complicated. If only all of Neil\u2019s problems had solutions as simple as orange juice and Advil.\n\u201cFine, don\u2019t rest,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cNever get better. See how useful you are to the Foxes when you can\u2019t run a full practice without passing out.\u201d\nNeil flinches, and Andrew might have regretted saying that, if it were not so effective. He watches Neil chew his lip and roll the fabric of the blanket between agitated fingers, not meeting Andrew\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Neil says at length. \u201cI\u2019ll go to bed. But I\u2019m not going to be able to fall asleep again.\u201d\n\u201cCount backward from a million for all I care,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cJust do it lying down.\u201d\nNeil goes.\nLike most arguments with Neil, the satisfaction of winning this one is short-lived. Andrew is on his way back from a CVS run for cold medicine and Kleenex when his phone rings.\n\u201cNeil is at the court,\u201d Nicky says.\nIt is fortunate that Andrew is sitting at a red light, as he has to close his eyes to contain his anger. \u201cYou let him go?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Nicky says. \u201cNo, I swear. He was gone when we got home. We assumed he was with you, but Mica just texted. Apparently, Neil made him drive them to the court early for night practice. Mica thinks there\u2019s something wrong with Neil.\u201d\nAndrew pulls an illegal U-turn at the light to head back toward the court. \u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cAlso, Kevin wanted me to make sure to tell you that he didn\u2019t put Neil up to \u2014 \u201d\nAndrew hangs up. Kevin is as much at fault for getting Neil hooked on night practices as Andrew is for his imprudent \u201csee how useful you are\u201d comment.\nOutside the Foxhole Court, Andrew parks beside Mica\u2019s unassuming Honda. If Neil drafted the new goalkeeper for tonight\u2019s practice, that means he is more interested in taking shots than teaching.\n\u201cSee how useful you are.\u201d Andrew should have known a comment like that would drive Neil here.\u00a0\nAndrew grabs his bag from the backseat and goes inside.\nHe enters the stands near the Home goal, where Mica is busy deflecting balls fired by Neil from the first-court line. Neil\u2019s shots are sloppy, and Mica bats away nearly a quarter of them \u2014 probably the freshman\u2019s first indication that something was wrong. Whatever Renee claims about the kid having promise, Andrew can count the number of shots Mica has blocked from Neil during normal practices on one hand.\nAndrew watches as Neil takes two dozen stationary shots, apparently not up to the task of a running start. Nor does Neil chase after any of the rebounds from Mica\u2019s saves, as he usually does to keep the round going as long as possible. Neil stumbles back from almost every swing, and his trembling hand drops the thirtieth ball back into the bucket a couple of times before he successfully loads it into his racquet. Yet Neil continues his merciless barrage on the goal.\nNeil Josten is ravenous for Exy. That feral hunger was what first caught Andrew\u2019s interest. For Andrew, aspiration was such an old, impossible ache that the hollowness barely registered anymore. But here was Neil Nobody Josten, a ruin of ambition. Neil did not want Exy the way Kevin did \u2014 like Exy was a stolen family heirloom he was entitled to reclaim. Neil needed Exy like a starving man needed a meal \u2014 a desire so strong that even Andrew thought he could feel the pangs of wanting again. He knows it had a similar effect on the rest of the Foxes. There is no other explanation for their astronomical rise this season.\nAndrew does not believe there is anything unique about Exy. In some alternate universe, Neil is kicking ass on a roller derby track or hockey rink. Andrew imagines that Neil\u2019s obsession would still be a team sport, given how terrified Neil is of his own potential for violence, and how much comfort he takes in the sanctioned aggression of the court. But all Neil ever needed to survive was an impossibility to chase, and Exy happened to be the one right in front of him.\nSometimes, it is fascinating to watch Neil manufacture almost religious meaning from an activity so inherently, cyclically pointless. Other times \u2014 right now, for instance \u2014 it is just exhausting.\nWhen Neil has emptied the entire bucket of balls at his feet, he leans heavily on his racquet to catch his breath. There are huge sweat patches beneath his armpits, and his inhales rattle. Neil, usually so preternaturally aware of his surroundings, does not seem to have noticed Andrew\u2019s arrival.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go again,\u201d Neil tells Mica, dragging a forearm across his forehead.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mica clutches his racquet to his chest with both hands. \u201cMaybe you should\u2014 \u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should watch the upper-left corner,\u201d Neil says, using his racquet to round up the balls closest to his feet, \u201cso I don\u2019t land another twelve shots there next time.\u201d\nAndrew retreats to the locker room to put on his padding.\nAndrew has never cared about Exy. He could not love the sport any more than Neil could love I-95 or Route 66 or any of the other roads he took away from his father. Until Neil, Exy was just the thing Andrew rode from hour to hour, day to day, away from the bad things behind him.\nWith Neil, though, Exy is also a useful language to speak when Andrew cannot find the right words, or Neil will not listen.\nAfter tightening his gloves and lodging his helmet under his arm, Andrew returns to the court, where Neil and Mica have nearly finished collecting the balls. Andrew lets the court door slam behind him to get their attention.\n\u201cAndrew,\u201d Mica says, looking, for the first time ever, relieved to see Andrew coming.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Andrew says \u2014 the most succinct of all the choice words he has for the moron who drove Neil here when he looks like this.\nNeil is downright sallow under the fluorescent lights. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he says, eying Andrew\u2019s protective gear warily.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Andrew says, jabbing Neil\u2019s chest with his racquet.\nNeil sways dangerously for a second before catching himself and batting Andrew\u2019s racquet away irritably. \u201cWhat I do every night. Practice.\u201d\n\u201cPractice,\u201d Andrew scoffs. \u201cIs that what you call landing thirty-five of fifty shots on a freshman? I\u2019d call that an embarrassment.\u201d\nIn Andrew\u2019s peripheral vision, Mica takes a step back.\nNeil\u2019s irritation evolves into anger. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m having an off night.\u201d\n\u201cGee. Wonder why that might be.\u201d\nNeil rolls his eyes. \u201cDid you seriously come all the way down here just to lecture me?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I came to make a deal.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s eyes widen marginally, then narrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf you can get a single ball in that bucket past me,\u201d Andrew says, \u201cI\u2019ll shut up about you being sick.\u201d\nNeil is incredulous. \u201cA single point. Are you serious?\u201d\n\u201cDeadly.\u201d\nNeil looks simultaneously suspicious and offended. \u201cI\u2019m not the same dumb kid who threw his arm out last summer,\u201d he says coolly.\nNo, he is not. But he still has not stopped leaning on his racquet for support.\n\u201cYes or no, Neil?\u201d\nAndrew can read the answer in the set of Neil\u2019s jaw before he opens his mouth.\n\u201cGet in the goal.\u201d\nMica does not have to be told to scram. In front of the Home goal, Andrew rolls out his neck and shakes out his arms before putting on his helmet and planting his feet in a ready position. While Andrew is confident that he can close out a goal against a feverish, exhausted Neil, it is true that Neil\u2019s power and precision have both improved orders of magnitude over the last year. Shutting him out, even in this state, will require effort.\nNeil stands on the first-court line with a ball in his racquet, waiting for Andrew to signal readiness. \u201cAny day now, Neil,\u201d Andrew drawls, just to ruffle him.\nNeil\u2019s first shot goes wide left, and Andrew savors the crack it makes against his racquet before it flies to the other side of the court. \u201cYou can do better than that,\u201d Andrew says, as he sends the second ball Neil hurls at him straight back over Neil\u2019s head.\nNeil rains shots down on Andrew with reckless vengeance, and Andrew slams ball after ball away from the goal as hard as he can. Normally, Andrew aims for Neil\u2019s ankles to make him dance a little, but Neil is unsteady on his feet as he is. Even from this distance, among the squeak of sneakers and clatter of Andrew's racquet, Andrew can hear Neil\u2019s labored breathing.\nAndrew deflects a dozen shots, then another dozen. Neil fumbles the twenty-eighth ball so badly he has to stumble after it before loading it into his racquet and lobbing it at Andrew, who knocks it aside with ease. Neil does not stop. He never knows how to stop.\n\u201cTypical of a jock,\u201d Andrew had thought, during that first practice. Andrew had seen and smashed Exy balls into the knees of plenty like him before. But Andrew had misunderstood. It was not ego that drove Neil, but pure id \u2014 a raw, lizard-brain desperation that was much harder to beat out of a person than dumb jock pride.\nSo much has changed since then. And yet this faceoff ends exactly the same, with Neil crumpled on the court floor.\nNeil has just slipped ball thirty-four into the net of his racquet when he suddenly clutches his forehead. Andrew watches as Neil lists sideways and his legs give out under him.\nAndrew is across the court and on his knees in front of Neil in seconds, yanking off his helmet and gloves. He rests a grounding hand on the back of Neil\u2019s neck and uses the other to push the sweaty hair out of his eyes. \u201cEasy,\u201d he murmurs, barely audible over Neil\u2019s rasping breath. \u201cEasy, Neil.\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s head snaps up at the sound of the court door opening. Mica rushes forward with a bottle of water in his outstretched hand. Andrew takes it and holds it in front of Neil\u2019s face until his eyes focus. \u201cDrink.\u201d\nNeil takes the bottle in shaking hands and closes his eyes while he sips. Andrew drops the hand on Neil\u2019s neck to his back to rub gentle circles between his shoulder blades.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t made an ass of yourself like this since our first practice,\u201d Andrew says.\nIn between gulps of water, Neil gives a wet scoff. \u201cOnly because I\u2019m sick.\u201d\n\u201cSo he finally admits it.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\nAndrew hums mildly, more content to indulge Neil\u2019s temper now that he has won. Andrew glances up to catch Mica watching the rhythmic motion of Andrew\u2019s hand on Neil\u2019s back.\n\u201cYou can go now,\u201d Andrew says.\nMica jumps and blushes. \u201cRight! Uh, I\u2019ll just.\u201d He jabs a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cFeel better, Neil.\u201d\nNeil, busy chugging water, lifts a hand in feeble farewell.\nOnce they are alone, Andrew smooths the hair back at Neil\u2019s temple and cups his cheek in one hand. \u201cYou are a mess.\u201d\nNeil makes a cyclic gesture with his free hand to fill in his part of the call-and-response while he drinks. When he has emptied the bottle and caught his breath, Neil tips his head forward to rest on Andrew\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d he says.\nAndrew shifts to sit down, so that Neil can rest more completely on his chest, practically in Andrew\u2019s lap. \u201cIs this\u00a0okay?\u201d\nThe sweaty, overheated bundle in Andrew\u2019s lap nods and tucks his sweaty, overheated face into Andrew\u2019s neck. At this rate they are both going to have to shower. \u201cCan we stay here for a minute?\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying here until you can walk back to the car,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cFair.\u201d Neil settles himself more deeply in Andrew\u2019s arms and sighs.\nSilence falls. Andrew wonders whether Neil has fallen asleep on top of him, until Neil murmurs, \u201cI hate this.\u201d\nAndrew waits for an elaboration.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d Neil says. \u201cThis is nothing. I\u2019ve driven a getaway car after getting shot \u2014 twice.\u201d\nFrom someone else, it would sound like a brag. (God knows Neil has such a number and variety of near-death experiences to his name that he might as well have been collecting them like Boy Scout badges.) But in Neil\u2019s tired voice, it is just a statement of fact. The precedent that Neil\u2019s life has set for him, as to what qualifies as fine.\n\u201cYou know the difference between you getting sick and you getting shot?\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t life-threatening?\u201d Neil guesses, which is true \u2014 but not a real answer, in Neil\u2019s sarcastic, self-loathing voice, so Andrew pinches his side for it.\n\u201cAfter you got shot, you didn\u2019t stick your finger in the bullet wound to fuck it up with infection,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cYou stitched it up and waited for it to heal.\u201d\nAndrew can feel Neil chewing the inside of his cheek against his shoulder.\n\u201cRefusing to rest when you are ill is irresponsible. Doing things that actively make your condition worse is idiotic,\u201d Andrew continues. \u201cYou cannot make your problems go away by ignoring them.\u201d\n\u201cDid Bee tell you that,\u201d Neil says dryly.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew says, well past his patience for Neil acting like therapy is no better than palm-reading.\nNeil balls his fingers into fists and tucks them under his chin. Andrew sighs and rests his cheek on the top of Neil\u2019s head for the satisfaction of feeling Neil curl tighter against him.\n\u201cGetting sick wasn\u2019t really\u2026 an option, when we were running,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cGetting sick is not a choice,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cAnd you are not running anymore.\u201d\n\u201cNo...\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nNeil blows out a breath that tickles Andrew\u2019s neck. \u201cBut being able to power through bodily harm is too useful a skill to lose.\u201d\n\u201cIgnoring your health is not a skill,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cIt is a coping mechanism that you developed when your only responsibility was outrunning hitmen. You have new responsibilities now.\u201d To the Moriyamas. To the Foxes. To me.\nNeil considers. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be better about the whole.\u201d He makes a vague flapping gesture. \u201cHealth. Thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo reassuring.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Neil says, with a huff that could be frustration or amusement or both. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say. No one else has ever cared this much.\u201d\n\u201cWho said I care.\u201d\n\u201cYou cared enough to practice,\u201d Neil says, definitely amused now. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Kevin.\u201d\n\u201cThis was not practice,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThis was proving a point.\u201d\n\u201cBy practicing.\u201d\n\u201cBy kicking your ass until you were literally incapable of argument.\u201d\n\u201cSo that you could lecture me about self-care,\u201d Neil says, lifting his head from Andrew\u2019s shoulder to give him a checkmate grin. \u201cBecause you care.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have gotten the same lecture from Nicky,\u201d Andrew says.\nNeil rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nAndrew arches an eyebrow.\n\u201cNicky wants to take care of me,\u201d Neil says, nose wrinkled at the thought of Nicky\u2019s particularly claustrophobic brand of affection. \u201cYou \u2014 make me want to take care of myself.\u201d\nAndrew would rather Neil\u2019s face were still pressed against his neck, so he could process that statement in private. But Neil has only two settings: horribly abstruse and horribly direct. And right now he is staring at Andrew with the unsettlingly open expression that only Neil has ever turned on Andrew. The one that makes Andrew think he might be worth a damn.\nMe too, Andrew thinks. Say it. You make me want that, too.\nBefore he can force the thought into words, Neil says, \u201cThank you. For caring, even when I\u2019m being a dick about it. I\u2019m still not used to having \u2014 \u201d Andrew inhales \u201c \u2014 friends.\u201d\nAndrew exhales. It is not as direct as \u201cwe are not together,\u201d but the privacy of the moment seems to give this statement more weight than the others. Andrew waits for the flash of shock-betrayal-anger he has come to expect after Neil\u2019s casual rejections, but this time it does not arrive. Andrew is just very, very tired.\nHe tilts his head back and syncs his breaths to the lazy twirl of a ceiling fan among the rafters above the court. Again, he thinks, this is the moment. Here is your opening. Say it.\nAndrew\u2019s stomach tightens, the way it would every summer afternoon when he was nine, and he climbed to the top of the high dive at the neighborhood pool to force himself to jump.\nConfronting the not nothing between them should not feel like the threat of free-fall. Not after all the intimate, ugly parts they have revealed to one another. Not after Neil has allowed Andrew to trace scars he has never let anyone see, and Andrew has let Neil touch him in places he has never voluntarily felt anyone else\u2019s hands. Not after sharing kisses and the same pillow and a couple life-threatening experiences.\nSaying what is the clearest truth that Andrew has ever known should not be this difficult.\nSay it.\n\u201cI would not do this for anyone else,\u201d Andrew says, which is both less and more than he means to give away.\nNeil swallows, wearing what Andrew has come to think of as his \u201cthank you, you were amazing\u201d face. After a moment, Neil puts his hand on Andrew\u2019s shoulder and tilts his head \u2014 a nonverbal yes-or-no that is more sign language than body language, at this point.\nAndrew\u2019s yes is a kiss dropped onto Neil\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting me sick,\u201d Andrew says in response to Neil\u2019s pout. \u201cConsider that your motivation to get better.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d\nNeil shrugs, unrepentant.\nAndrew shifts to relieve some of their weight from his fallen-asleep left buttock. \u201cWhere are we, re: you standing up,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI can,\u201d Neil says, nosing at Andrew\u2019s cheek. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to stay for a few more minutes,\u201d Neil says, tucking his face back under Andrew\u2019s chin. \u201cIs that all right?\u201d\nAndrew tightens his arms around Neil. \u201cFor you? Anything,\u201d he says, aiming for sarcastic, but not quite hitting the mark.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n+1\n\nAndrew is going to say something.\nAs much he loathes the prospect, it cannot possibly be any worse than continuing the tedious dance that he and Neil have been locked in for weeks. Renee was right. Gestures and intimations are not enough. Andrew has to say something.\nThe first time he tries, they are sitting on the roof at dusk. Andrew rubs his eyes and looks up from the Russian phrasebook that he is barely able to read by the fading light of the purple sky. Beside him, Neil is absolutely mangling the block of wood from which he is supposed to be chiseling a chess pawn. Beside Neil\u2019s knee is the pawn Andrew carved earlier \u2014 example and challenge all in one. Neil\u2019s brow and lips are pinched with the aggressive attention he turns on all his problems, and as Andrew watches him, a strangely warm, buoyant sensation wells up inside his chest.\nWithout really meaning to, Andrew says, \u201cHey.\u201d\nNeil looks up. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, and for once, Andrew wishes Neil would look at him with anything less than complete, undivided attention, because Andrew has no idea what to say next.\n\u201cStop telling people we are not together when we obviously are\u201d would be most direct. But Andrew is not going to tell Neil what they are. Whatever Neil says about \u201cit\u2019s always a yes with you,\u201d Andrew stands by \u201cuntil it\u2019s a no.\u201d Andrew will respect the possibility, however minor, that Neil wants something different.\nWhich requires formulating a question. Andrew considers cashing in for a truth. But \u201cWhat are we?\u201d would be a useless thing to ask, since Andrew already knows that whatever Neil thinks is the correct answer, is too close to platonic. \u201cWhat do you want us to be?\u201d might work, if Andrew did not half-expect Neil to say something like \u201cwhatever you want us to be.\u201d\nSeriously, fuck Andrew\u2019s big mouth for opening before he had a goddamn plan. Now he is left staring at Neil, paralyzed by indecision, while Neil stares back, expectant but not impatient, like he is totally content just to sit here and have Andrew\u2019s attention, which is \u2014 distracting. Andrew can\u2019t think like this.\n\u201cStaring,\u201d Andrew mutters, and flicks Neil on the forehead.\nNeil pleasantly bats Andrew\u2019s hand away and returns to his wood block.\nOf course, as soon as Neil looks away, Andrew realizes what he should have said was, \u201cI want to be together, yes or no?\u201d\nSo easy, so simple. So manageable.\nBut the moment has passed.\nNext time, Andrew thinks. Next time, he will ask.\nThere are a lot of next times: Like in the kitchen the following afternoon, while Neil is sitting on the counter with Andrew standing between his legs, and Neil uses his shoulder to scratch an itch on his nose to avoid unhooking his arms from around Andrew\u2019s neck. Or at practice a few days later, when Neil cracks a perfectly aimed ball off the back of Kevin\u2019s helmet to interrupt his lecture about Andrew slacking off.\n\u201cI want to be together, yes or no?\u201d\nAndrew could say it. He has mentally rehearsed it enough times. But none of these moments, when the question has presented itself in Andrew\u2019s mind, has seemed right. The question is important. The circumstances should match.\nAndrew is not, to be clear, asking for circumstances as dire as those surrounding Neil\u2019s \u201cthank you, you were amazing.\u201d But Andrew refuses to raise a question so important over something as banal as Neil requesting Tabasco sauce for Andrew\u2019s mashed potatoes while Andrew is washing his hands in the restaurant bathroom. (Shut up, Nicky, it\u2019s delicious.)\nRealistically, Andrew knows that the actual right moment was after their last match against the Ravens, when Andrew stopped actively arguing against Neil\u2019s insistence that there was something between them. Which means that if Andrew is going to uphold his personal policy of No Regrets, he is going to need a runner-up moment that is almost as good.\nAt first, it seems like Andrew might have time to wait for his moment to arrive. July folds into August, and life at Palmetto continues apace. Practices happen. Evenings slide away on the roof with Neil. Non-athletes start to arrive on campus, and Andrew\u2019s books for the new semester start to arrive in the mail. Neil has not hit Andrew with a \u201cwe are not together\u201d in weeks and Andrew\u2019s life is all, essentially, fine.\nThis grace period abruptly ends one evening over a family dinner \u2014 which Andrew has conceded to attending on a weekly basis, because resistance causes Nicky to spend more than a dinner\u2019s worth of time pestering Andrew to come.\nTonight, Nicky and Aaron are discussing the team\u2019s new wagers on whether Mica will ask Renee to the fall banquet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy to bet against him,\u201d Aaron tells Nicky. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen his face whenever Wymack sends Renee to work one-on-one with him in goal.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just overjoyed that Wymack isn\u2019t sending Andrew instead,\u201d Nicky says, throwing Andrew a wink. Andrew throws a piece of broccoli at him. \u201cHey! Manners. Who raised you?\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d Andrew retorts \u2014 and then, because Nicky looks so touched he might cry, quickly says, \u201cYou idiots are betting on the wrong thing. Renee is not going to let the baby freshman embarrass himself. The real question is who she will ask to the banquet before he can ask her.\u201d\nAaron and Nicky consider this. Kevin, as usual, is spending the meal watching Exy on his phone under the table.\n\u201cAllison?\u201d Aaron suggests.\n\u201cYou obviously don\u2019t follow Allison on Instagram,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cShe\u2019s probably already asked that football player she\u2019s been hanging out with all summer.\u201d\n\u201cMoreau, then,\u201d Aaron says.\n\u201cYou obviously don\u2019t follow Jeremy Knox on Instagram,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t take Jean himself, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s letting Jean farther than arm\u2019s length away with the Ravens in the same room.\u201d\nAaron scratches his jaw. \u201cWhat other single people do we know?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe someone from her church?\u201d Nicky says.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she just take Andrew?\u201d Neil says.\nAndrew\u2019s brain record-scratches. So does everyone else\u2019s, judging by the way all eyes turn on Neil. Even Kevin glances up from his phone to look at Neil like, \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would she go with Andrew?\u201d Nicky says, slow and confused.\n\u201cBecause she always goes with Andrew,\u201d Neil says, equally slow and confused.\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Nicky says, \u201cuntil you.\u201d\nNeil frowns. \u201cI only took her last year because Andrew was at Easthaven.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I meant,\u201d Nicky says, and Andrew can already see exactly how this exchange is going to play out \u2014 the horrible inevitability of it, like an impending car crash. \u201cAndrew\u2019s obviously going to go to the banquet with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would he go with me?\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re his boyfriend?\u201d Nicky says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not his \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cEveryone shut up.\u201d He forces himself to uncurl his fingers from around his table knife and drops it onto his plate with a clatter. Fuck. He was going to do this on his own terms. He had a plan.\nWell. When has anything in Andrew\u2019s life ever gone according to plan.\n\u201cEveryone get out. Not you,\u201d Andrew adds, planting a hand on Neil\u2019s shoulder to prevent him rising from his chair.\n\u201cOr you could leave,\u201d Aaron says sourly.\n\u201cNo, no, we\u2019ll go,\u201d Nicky says, eying the knife inches from Andrew\u2019s hand. He stands up hastily, tugging on Aaron\u2019s sleeve. \u201cLet\u2019s give these two some privacy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not done eating,\u201d Aaron grouches.\nNicky steals Aaron\u2019s plate and carries it to the door. \u201cProblem solved. Kevin?\u201d\nKevin leaves his plate but takes his phone.\n\u201cDrama queens,\u201d Aaron mutters, shoving his chair back loudly and snatching his plate back from Nicky on their way out.\nThe door closes.\nThere is a silence, during which Andrew attempts to collect his thoughts and Neil watches him guardedly.\n\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re mad at me?\u201d Neil says after a space.\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you,\u201d Andrew snaps, because he isn\u2019t angry at Neil, exactly. He knew to expect this of Neil. Andrew is angry because he had an idea of how this was going to go, and a fight about the fucking fall banquet was not part of the script.\nNeil raises a skeptical eyebrow.\nAndrew unclenches his jaw, unclenches his fists, and turns in his chair to face Neil directly. \u201cI am not going to the fall banquet with Renee,\u201d he bites out.\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Neil says. \u201cNo one is making you. It was just an idea.\u201d\nAndrew inhales deeply through his nose. \u201cI am not going to the fall banquet with Renee, because I\u2019m going with you. If you want.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s expression is temporarily frozen in surprise, until the corner of his mouth quirks up, sending an intense swoop through Andrew\u2019s stomach. \u201cReally?\u201d he says.\n\u201cYes, Neil,\u201d Andrew says, trying for exasperation and finding it difficult, on account of all the swooping. \u201cYes or no?\u201d\n\u201cYes, obviously.\u201d For the first time ever, Neil looks pleased at the prospect of an Exy banquet. He reaches for Andrew\u2019s hand with raised eyebrows. Andrew gives it to him. Neil laces their fingers together. \u201cOf course I want to go with you.\u201d\nAndrew cannot think of any response that does not give away far more than he has already, except a terse, \u201cGood.\u201d\nNeil must read something more on Andrew\u2019s face, though, because his smile slants into a smirk and he says, \u201cYou should have just said so.\u201d\nIt rankles.\n\u201cYou should not have assumed I would go with Renee,\u201d Andrew says coolly.\nNeil looks guilty. \u201cSorry. I just thought since you always go together \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cThis clearly changes things,\u201d Andrew says, furiously ignoring the irony of the situation as he waves a finger between their chests.\nNeil\u2019s lips part around a silent \u201coh,\u201d before he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize this factored into it.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think the fact that we were dating would factor into whether I go on dates with other people,\u201d Andrew snipes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re \u2014 \u201d Neil swallows, gaping at Andrew. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2014 what?\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s fingers tighten around Neil\u2019s. No. He is asking, not telling.\nHe makes himself take a fucking breath and say, \u201cI want us to be together. Yes or no?\u201d\nNeil blinks at him slowly. \u201cYou want us to be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTogether. Dating. Boyfriends,\u201d Andrew says, impatient for an answer to relieve the terrible anticipation that has strung his whole body taut. \u201cYes or no?\u201d\nNeil seems to struggle to make his voice work for another long second, before he gets out an emphatic, \u201cYes \u2014 Andrew, yes,\u201d and his face splits into a wide grin that sets off firecrackers inside Andrew. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d\nAndrew nods.\nHe expects something hurried, hungry. But Neil\u2019s lips are slow and gentle against Andrew\u2019s, in the rare kind of careful kiss that leaves Andrew feeling \u2014 unfurled.\nWhen Neil draws back, he does not go far. He rests his forehead against Andrew\u2019s, and inhales Andrew\u2019s uneven exhale. Andrew grounds himself with the sensation of Neil\u2019s hair between his fingers, because the strong wind of exhilaration running through his body could just about carry him away.\n\u201cGive me a truth,\u201d Neil murmurs. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d\nAndrew\u2019s fingers tighten marginally in Neil\u2019s hair. \u201cChanged.\u201d\nNeil pulls back just far enough to look Andrew in the eye. \u201cWhat changed your mind about wanting to be together,\u201d he explains. \u201cDating. Boyfriends.\u201d\nAndrew runs his thumb once, twice, three times across the soft skin just behind Neil\u2019s ear. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Neil echoes. \u201cYou always wanted \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNeil processes this. \u201cWhat changed your mind about telling me?\u201d\nAndrew has hardly told Neil anything now. He has not told Neil how settling it is to walk into a room and orient himself relative to Neil. How sharing the court with Neil is like standing beside a bonfire after being cold for a very, very long time. How Andrew\u2019s neural circuitry lights up like a pinball machine when he has Neil soft and happy and pliant beneath him, in a way that Neil never is anywhere else.\nHow Andrew was so certain for so long that he would eventually crush this thing between them, or it would crush him \u2014 but now, he is not so sure.\nHow there are so many truer truths for Andrew to give Neil than \u201cdating\u201d or \u201cboyfriends,\u201d but he needs these placeholders to keep Neil here, until Andrew can tell him the other things. How Andrew, against all reason and past precedent, wants to tell Neil the other things.\n\u201cI thought I could make it obvious,\u201d Andrew says, lifting their hands sardonically \u2014 because Andrew may be ready to tell Neil the other things someday, but today is not that day. And because this conversation is already so far afield of Andrew\u2019s comfort zone that it seems necessary to bring them back toward familiar territory. \u201cBut clearly, I overestimated your ability to put two-and-two together.\u201d\nAndrew expects the fond eye roll that is Neil\u2019s response to most of Andrew\u2019s insults. What he gets instead is Neil pulling his hand out of Andrew\u2019s and sitting back in his chair, arms folded and gaze sharp enough to pare Andrew down to the bone.\n\u201cWhat made you think that after everything, I would make any assumptions about what you want?\u201d Neil says, and Andrew \u2014\nAndrew has no good response.\nBecause on the one hand, Neil makes a fair point. Neil told Andrew in the spring that he would never cross a line without invitation, and he never has. The night they returned from Virginia was a stark reminder of Neil\u2019s stubborn refusal to imagine them as anything more than exactly what Andrew said.\nOn the other, Neil\u2019s unrelenting commitment to Andrew\u2019s consent is still so unexpected that Andrew does not know how to plan for it. For weeks, Andrew was operating under the assumption that, given enough circumstantial evidence, Neil would eventually draw his own conclusions about what Andrew wanted, absolving Andrew of any need to confess.\nOn some level, Andrew always counted on the idea that, eventually, Neil would reach his limit for waiting for Andrew\u2019s permission for everything. To believe otherwise would be \u2014 well. A pipedream.\nYet here Neil sits, again, waiting for Andrew\u2019s answer.\n\u201cYou are impossible,\u201d Andrew marvels \u2014 simultaneously settled and unsettled by this further confirmation that none of Andrew\u2019s long-held rules of engagement apply with Neil. Andrew leans forward in his chair and says, \u201cThis was never nothing.\u201d\nNeil probably has a right to feel smug \u2014 vindicated, even. But his expression remains serious as he says, \u201cSay that again.\u201d\n\u201cYou know how I feel about repeating myself,\u201d Andrew says, because saying it even once set off some kind of riot in his stomach.\n\u201cYou know how I need things spelled out for me,\u201d Neil says.\nWell, Andrew thinks. Some things bear repeating, for Neil.\nAndrew hooks a hand around the back of Neil\u2019s neck and takes a moment to memorize the solemn intent in Neil\u2019s shocking blue eyes. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, \u201cwas never nothing.\u201d And underscores the point with a gentle tug to invite Neil to close the space between them.\nAndrew did not anticipate how much better a kiss could be with the sweet, crystalline certainty that Neil wants this just as much, and in the same way that Andrew does \u2014 and that Neil knows exactly how much Andrew wants it, too.\nFor a long time, Andrew thought of his attachment to Neil as an unstable equilibrium, as inevitably short-lived as a knife\u2019s edge balance. But the way he and Neil come together, Neil\u2019s lips on Andrew\u2019s, Neil\u2019s hair between his fingers, Neil\u2019s warmth so close it could be Andrew\u2019s own \u2014 this is starting to feel like the inevitability.\n\u201cSo, boyfriend, huh,\u201d Neil says, breathless, when they break apart.\nAndrew drops one last ghost of a kiss on the corner of Neil\u2019s mouth. \u201cIs that a question, or an observation.\u201d\n\u201cBoth?\u201d Neil says. \u201cDo you \u2014 \u201d His throat clicks on a swallow. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d The cautious hope in Neil\u2019s voice sinks a sharp hook behind Andrew\u2019s heart and yanks.\nAndrew tests out the word \u201cboyfriend\u201d in his mind and is surprised at how\u2026 fine it is. Like Neil laying on Andrew\u2019s chest in bed \u2014 holding on, rather than behind held down.\n\u201cIt is the truth,\u201d Andrew says. At least, it is the closest a single word can get.\n\u201cAnd we both know how you feel about truths,\u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew agrees, and Neil cracks a smile. Ah, there is some of the self-satisfaction Andrew expected earlier.\n\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Neil says, and Andrew will never, ever tell Neil how much more he likes the word coming out of Neil\u2019s mouth, or Neil will never shut up about it. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, if I start calling you my boyfriend, people are going to know,\u201d Neil says, eyes dancing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to know you care,\u201d Neil says, looking positively smug about it. \u201cAbout me. More than other people.\u201d\n\u201cI care about very few people,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThat\u2019s not that impressive.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Romantic.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cShould we be? More romantic,\u201d Neil adds, in response to Andrew\u2019s quirked eyebrow. \u201cLike, should we try \u2014 going on a date? Or something?\u201d\n\u201cWow. Romantic.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Neil quips. \u201cSeriously.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously? Do you want to go on a date?\u201d\n\u201cI asked you first.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s my turn to claim a truth,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cPay up.\u201d\nNeil huffs, but he does not actually look bothered. \u201cI think\u2026 I think, yeah, that could be nice,\u201d he says, just this side of shy. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cHow about a candlelit dinner at your favorite restaurant. Rasika, Saturday at seven?\u201d\nNeil raises his eyebrows. \u201cWow, you really had that one on the tip of your \u2014 Wait.\u201d\nIt is deeply satisfying to watch shocked realization bloom across Neil\u2019s face.\n\u201cDid we \u2014 \u201d Neil says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cBut that was like, a month ago,\u201d Neil says, expression caught between wonder and horror.\n\u201cLike I said, your deductive reasoning skills leave a lot to be desired.\u201d\nNeil considers this. Slowly, his smirk returns full-force. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to convince me that we\u2019re dating for a month.\u201d\nAndrew refuses to answer that, but his silence sort of speaks for itself.\n\u201cYou must really like me,\u201d Neil says, delighted in his accusation.\n\u201cSmug is not a good look on you,\u201d Andrew says.\n\u201cYou like it,\u201d Neil teases.\nAndrew almost \u2014 almost \u2014 tells Neil that he hates it. But just for the shock value, he says, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\nNeil\u2019s jaw drop is well worth the admission.\nAndrew dons a smirk of his own as he hooks a finger in the collar of Neil\u2019s shirt to pull him closer. \u201cYes or no?\u201d he says, and at Neil\u2019s nod, Andrew closes the space between them."
