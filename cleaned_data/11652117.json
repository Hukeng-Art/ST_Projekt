NEXT CHAPTEr, however, will contain much much more spice so dont jump ship just yet!!</p>\n<p>again thank you so very much for all the comments. even if i don't reply, i genuinely read each one multiple times and it brings a huge smile to my face !</p>\n<p><i>Next chapter:</i> Shouto unwillingly shares with the class, Bakugou is angry, and popcorn is...sexy?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>See you Space Cowboy...</i>\n</p>\n<p>FOR REFERENCE: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EkLnFYXsNe8\" rel=\"nofollow\">watch like 20 secs of this</a>. this happens in the middle of every episode lol</p>\n<p>it just occurred to me that i made a huge misstep not making the chapter summary for the mcDonalds chapter \"yeah can i get a fuckin uhhhhhhhh- Borger\" bc that shit cracks me up.</p>\n<p>also, sorry about the tardiness once agin. But rest assured knowing that I'm busy as FUCK, its honestly horrible but what can yo do lmao. hopefully y'all enjoy this chapter, i had a hell of a time writing it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://screaming-l0rd-byr0n.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my beta</a> is a huge help, as always~</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>deadass that \"fullmetal alchemist.\" \"fullmetal alchemist\" (slightly different tone) is one of my fav fandom memes so if nothing else, i cracked myself tf up thinking about it. </p>\n<p>again i apologize for the delay! and this chapter is so self-indulgent, i cry. it's about time i label this a crack fic tbh. but enough about me....</p>\n<p>Just FYI the next chapter has some of my very fav bits!! so get ready kiddos ;)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for all comments/kudos/etc! they really do mean a ton, I read each and every one!</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the encouraging comments!!

Hope this wasn't too disappointing after that dreadfully long wait! Once again, I really appreciated the comments, so thank you :D</p>\n<p>(also if you were wondering why Midoriya just didnt take the elevator down to his room the answer is shhhhhhhh)</p>\n<p><i>Next chapter</i>: Todoroki reaches Absolute Zero of embarrassment, so much so that I as the author want to perish while writing it. Poor kid.</p>\n<p>*Roblox voice* Ooef!!</p>\n<p>I do have my reasons for taking so long with this, but who gives a shit lmao. All that matters is that it's finally out! I hope this is somewhat remotely satisfying, part of the reason I never updated was fear of providing a solid ending. I really wanna deliver for y'all!</p>\n<p>Also, I just realized this has been a pretty smut-free fic (which is fucking unbelievable just given my history of fic writing lol), so if you don't like that sort of thing, skip from \"<i>Hell, with Todoroki's luck</i>... to \"<i>Are you alright? I'm pretty sure I smell smoke!</i>\".</p>\n<p>that's all for now, thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>dude idk why but posting the official Wiki descriptions craacked me tf up.</p>\n<p>i'm sorry i made it so obnoxiously obvious that Bakugou is my favorite character to write, he's just such a loser I can't resist including him a lot lmao</p>\n<p>OH WOW! I have a lot to say, feel free to skip it all!</p>\n<p>Firstly, thank you so much for each and every comment. I mean that sincerely; the comments and overall response were literally the only motivation that actually got me to finish this sonuvabitch. I would feel super discouraged and like a piece of shit because of subpar writing, but then I'd think about all the times I'd cry over abandoned fics, and I didnt wanna do that to y'all so it helped me get off my ass and finish it! So thank you SO MUCH, I genuinely mean it. </p>\n<p>Also, it's highly possible that I didn't really round out themes and motifs that i set up early, just because I wrote this ending almost a year after writing all the other stuff aha. (I'm the worst). That being said, I'm willing to write a headass epilogue-thingy that involves more of the other characters, because i feel like I didn't really include them enough but didn't wanna bog down the pacing. also, i feel like i should have more of midoriya reacting to the truth quirk lol. Idk, y'all tell me what you think! I adore constructive criticism in general.</p>\n<p>That should be about it! It means so much that y'all stuck with me for nearly a year. I have a Kiribaku fic in the works that I can't wait to post, so be on the lookout if that pairing tickles your pickle.</p>\n<p>&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/i-d-k-man\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumble</a>. Do u?? ;)</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\nBright sunlight made Todoroki squint as he stepped through the hospital\u2019s automatic doors. \u00a0\nIt was a beautiful day - surprisingly cool for June - with a pleasant breeze tossing Todoroki\u2019s bangs. \u00a0Even the hospital had seemed cheerful, his mother smiling softly as Todoroki opened her window, then laughing behind her hand as the wind caught the curtain and smacked her son in the face. \u00a0\nShe had been laughing more and more lately, each giggle (and occasional snort) threading one more stitch across the fractures of the past between them. \u00a0After all, Todoroki had heard that broken bones grow back stronger.\nClosing his eyes leisurely, Todoroki basked in the sunlight.\nA short buzz in Todoroki\u2019s pocket interrupted his musings, and he pulled his phone out. \u00a0Midoriya Izuku, the screen read. Speaking of broken bones...\nAs Todoroki typed in his passcode, another buzz rattled the phone, also courtesy of Midoriya Izuku. \u00a0A perfectly suitable contact name, intentionally dull so as not to raise any suspicion. \u00a0Kirishima had more than provided a cautionary tale last year, when Ashido had discovered that his contact name for Bakugou was \u201cBakuuuBabe\u201d, accompanied by a rather unfortunate string of emojis (the water droplets especially stood out). \u00a0For nearly a month, a chorus of \u201cBakuuu!\u201ds chimed whenever Bakugou entered a room or hallway, like some occult ritual. \u00a0\nA couple charred streaks remained on the hallway floors to this day. \u00a0Needless to say, Todoroki wasn\u2019t about to go putting Midoriya\u2019s contact as \u2018light of my life\u2019, \u2018reason green is my favorite color\u2019, or any of those other intrusive thoughts that spun right \u2018round like a record through Todoroki\u2019s head whenever he was around the boy. \u00a0 Midoriya Izuku\u00a0was proper, professional.\n(Midoriya Izuku\u00a0somehow still managed to send a pleasant chill up Todoroki\u2019s spine.)\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; hey man, u still wanna join us or should we just go ahead and start ?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki glanced at the time, 10:37. \u00a0Ah, he was running late. \u00a0The unofficial little \u201cMen of Class 1-A Weekend Workout Squad\u201d (or \u201cSwole Team 6,\u201d as Kirishima called it) usually started an hour or so before lunch.\n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt;  Count me in, if nobody minds waiting. \u00a0I should be back on campus in half an hour. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; great !!\u00a0 Midoriya replied almost immediately. \u00a0see u there, Freezer Burn :)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2018Freezer Burn\u2019, huh? \u00a0That was a new one.\nIt really was a beautiful day, so Todoroki let the butterflies flit freely within him as he basked in the sun at the train stop. \u00a0He liked when Midoriya called him nicknames. \u00a0Or called him his real name. \u00a0Or looked Todoroki\u2019s way in general. \u00a0It didn't take much, with Midoriya.\nThe breeze smelled like roses.\nA couple minutes passed, and the train pulled into the station, rumbling to a halt. \u00a0The doors slid open, revealing an angry couple, screeching hysterically. \u00a0The warmth of the sun dissipated as Todoroki boarded and found a seat, as far from the racket as possible. \u00a0He sighed - the peace had been nice while it lasted.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even try giving me that bullshit again, Subaru!\u201d \u00a0some lady was yelling, her eyes cocooned in black eyeliner and long nails glittering in the fluorescent light. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at her, it\u2019s like a dog drooling over a piece of meat. \u00a0Or its own vomit. \u00a0You\u2019re disgusting, Subaru, a fucking disgrace!\u201d\nA man - presumably Subaru - threw his arms up in frustration. \u00a0\u201cFor the last time, Mitsubishi, I told you that she\u2019s just a friend. \u00a0I\u2019d hang out with any of my friends at 3 am, that\u2019s no big deal! \u00a0In fact, I\u2019d love to go out late with you, but you insist on sleeping before midnight, like some senior citizen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so I love sleeping. \u00a0Sue me!\u201d \u00a0Mitsubishi was really fuming now - it reminded Todoroki of someone, but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it. \u00a0\u201cAt least I do it alone. \u00a0Unlike you, you fuck!\u201d\nBakugou!\u00a0 The answer clicked in Todoroki\u2019s head. \u00a0That\u2019s who Mitsubishi reminded him of. \u00a0It must be the homicide in her eyes.\n\u201cT-that\u2019s ridi- I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say-!\u201d \u00a0Subaru stammered. \u00a0\u201cMitsubishi, I would never.\u201d\nA wicked smile uncoiled across glossy red lips. \u00a0\u201cIs that so? \u00a0Then why don\u2019t we make ourselves 100% certain?\u201d\nDread eclipsed Subaru\u2019s face, and he began backpedaling both literally and figuratively, retreating into Todoroki\u2019s personal space. \u00a0Great. \u00a0\u201cN-now, there\u2019s no need for extremes, babe. \u00a0Have I mentioned how sexy you look in that lipstick color? \u00a0Why would I ever even look at another girl when I have you!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d Mitsubishi menaced, eyes positively sparking with ill-intent as she stretched out a hand towards her (soon to be ex, in Todoroki\u2019s opinion) boyfriend. \u00a0Her expression was downright murderous - had Bakugou mentioned having an aunt in the area?\nAny musings surrounding Mitsubishi and possible relation to Bakugou were dispelled as Todoroki felt his phone vibrating on his knee. \u00a0Midoriya Izuku. \u00a0Ahhh. \u00a0Todoroki put the phone up to his ear. \u00a0\u201cHello, Midor--\u201d\nThree things then happened in quick succession:\n1) \u00a0The train cabin shuddered suddenly without warning. \u00a0\n2) \u00a0Mitsubishi, caught off guard, lost her balance, desperately grabbing Todoroki\u2019s shoulder in order to stay upright.\n3) \u00a0A violent bolt of nausea crackled through Todoroki, and his head swam painfully.\nThankfully, the train returned to its original course as quickly as it had left it. \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s stomach smoothly unwound, the nausea disappearing completely. \u00a0He breathed heavily, eyebrows knit in confusion as he rubbed his shoulder where Mitsubishi had speared him with her nails. \u00a0\u00a0What the hell was that about? \u00a0Had he eaten something bad?\nA loud gasp tore Todoroki from his thoughts. \u00a0Mitsubishi looked downright horrified, her hands slapping over her mouth. \u00a0\u201cOh shit, shit, shit! \u00a0Fuck, do you feel sick at- hey, wait.\u201d \u00a0Her heavily outlined eyes popped even wider, if possible. \u00a0\u201cAre you that Todoroki kid, from U.A.?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki replied, curiously quickly. \u00a0He normally tried to avoid drawing attention in public.\n\u201cOh, I see you all over Twitter! \u00a0You were so cool in the sports festival last year - I was totally rooting for you, by the way.\u201d \u00a0Mitsubishi beamed widely, a small blotch of lipstick disrupting the glare of her white teeth. \u00a0Todoroki nodded weakly. \u00a0To think, just a minute ago he had been calling her a relative of Bakugou. \u00a0\nStill smiling unnaturally wide, Mitsubishi beat a hasty retreat. \u00a0Subaru, for his part, looked even more horrified than before. \u00a0He opened his mouth, but Mitsubishi sent him another Bakugou glare, yanking her thumb and pointer across her lips harshly in the universal \u2018zip your lips\u2019 gesture. \u00a0\nTodoroki frowned. \u00a0What was that about? \u00a0And wait, what was up with that whole nausea thing?\nHe opened his mouth to inquire as such, but Midoriya chose that moment to conduct his own questioning. \u00a0\u201cTodoroki? \u00a0Are you there? \u00a0You stopped replying!\u201d\nThe warm crackle of Midoriya\u2019s voice, as always, quickly monopolized all of Todoroki\u2019s brainpower, and soon enough, all thoughts of Mitsubishi and possible food poisoning had vanished.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. \u00a0Sorry, the train got a little bumpy for a second\u2026\u201d\nTodoroki exited the train station as carefree as he had entered it. \u00a0It really was a beautiful day. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAn hour later, Todoroki walked into the men\u2019s locker room, a small duffel bag and water bottle in tow.\n\u201cHey, bro!\u201d \u00a0Kirishima looked up from where he was tying his shoes, grinning. \u00a0\u201cGlad you decided to come!\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki replied a bit awkwardly, unsure of what to say. \u00a0Kirishima always greeted him like it was Todoroki\u2019s first time working out with them, while in reality he attended nearly every week. \u00a0Todoroki had actually been one of the founding members of the group (along with Midoriya and Iida), despite actually preferring to exercise alone. \u00a0\nWorking out in groups was great, is all. \u00a0Very important for both mind and body, building camaraderie. \u00a0And if Todoroki had had an ulterior motive for forming Swole Team 6, then nobody had to know. \u00a0\n\u201cTook you fucking long enough to get here, asshole,\u201d Bakugou grumbled with a scowl, and in retrospect, Mitsubishi\u2019s harshest expressions seemed downright welcoming.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya, the ulterior motive himself, beamed. \u00a0\u201cTaking the train can be such a pain.\u201d\nTodoroki only allowed his mind to dwell on gooey thoughts concerning green hair and bright eyes for a moment before he forcibly ejected them. \u00a0\u201cThanks for waiting. \u00a0So, what are we doing today?\u201d\nIida raised his hand and sprung upright. \u00a0\u201cI would like to present an idea! \u00a0Last night, I had a dream about Mr. Aizawa, and--\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c--Wow, how scandalous of our very own class president! \u00a0I never knew you liked older men, Iida,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari interrupted, waggling his eyebrows. \u00a0\nIida glared at Kaminari sternly, adjusting his glasses. \u00a0\u201cNot that kind of dream. \u00a0Which should go without saying.\u201d \u00a0Another pointed glare. \u00a0\u201cIn it, I forgot to turn in a large assignment, and Mr. Aizawa erased my quirk forever as punishment.\u201d \u00a0Iida shuddered. \u00a0\u201cIt was an unpleasant dream. \u00a0However, I began thinking about my abilities without my quirk, and I realized I\u2019d like to work on my hand to hand combat skills without quirks.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami nodded. \u00a0\u201cWe should always be prepared for scenarios where our quirks are disabled. \u00a0Darkness surely lurks behind every corner.\u201d \u00a0\nThe entire locker room chimed in agreement, collectively ignoring Tokoyami\u2019s comment. \u00a0Kaminari pulled a die from his pocket. \u00a0\u201cWe can use this to pair up.\u201d\n\u201cWhy..are you carrying around dice?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Midoriya asked.\n\u201cI use them to do magic tricks,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari winked. \u00a0\u201cThe ladies love them.\u201d\nTodoroki wasn\u2019t so sure. \u00a0\nAfter a couple minutes, the group had split up. \u00a0Todoroki ended up paired with Midoriya - of course he did. \u00a0Why would the universe ever cut him a break, especially when his self-control was already on the wobbly side, crippled by changing in the same room as Midoriya? \u00a0Sparring with his crush was a double-edged sword if ever one was forged, and there was no way he\u2019d escape without any nicks.\n\u201cHey, partner,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya jogged over to Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cThis will be great training, don't you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think. Yes, I do,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki babbled, a little thrown off by Midoriya\u2019s radiance, then wanted to die when he realized what he'd said. \u00a0God, there was no way he'd survive this, at this rate. \u00a0The sword was already unsheathed. \u00a0\u00a0\nYet, impossibly, with 15 minutes past, Todoroki had managed to avoid any overtly self-incriminating actions. \u00a0The sparring session couldn't make up its mind between rapture and torture. \u00a0\nA pro: \u00a0Midoriya unconsciously licking his lips in concentration.\nA con: \u00a0Todoroki taking a hit every time Midoriya unconsciously licked his lips in concentration.\nPro: \u00a0getting to ogle Midoriya\u2019s neck when he tossed his head back to drink water.\nCon: \u00a0resisting the urge to kiss Midoriya\u2019s neck when he tossed his head back to drink water.\nPro: \u00a0falling on top of Midoriya on more than one occasion, their bodies pressed close. \u00a0\nCon: \u00a0desperately reciting mathematical formulas in his head to avoid a more, ahem, prominent reaction when Todoroki fell on top of Midoriya, their bodies pressed close.\nPro: \u00a0practicing hand-to-hand combat technique, one of Todoroki\u2019s rustier skills.\nCon: \u00a0Todoroki was not focusing on his hand-to-hand combat technique, one of his rustier skills.\nStars twinkled in Todoroki\u2019s skull as Midoriya landed a particularly nasty right hook - Aoyama would have been delighted. \u00a0\n\u201cC-crap, Todoroki, I didn\u2019t mean to hit you that hard!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s eyebrows were knit in concern. \u00a0\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki lied - or at least tried to. \u00a0Somehow, the word wouldn\u2019t come out. \u00a0Todoroki frowned. \u00a0\u201cNo\u201d, he said, more firmly. \u00a0Still, nothing came out but a raspy exhale. \u00a0\nSomething akin to panic began rising in Todoroki. \u00a0Had the punch screwed with his vocal chords? \u00a0There was no way, right? \u00a0He was just overreacting.\nMidoriya, meanwhile, was wringing his hands anxiously. \u00a0\u201cT-todoroki? \u00a0Oh my god. \u00a0Please don\u2019t tell me I gave you a concussion. \u00a0Do you feel alright?\u201d\nCrap, he hadn\u2019t meant to worry Midoriya. \u00a0Todoroki took a deep breath, forcibly calming himself. \u00a0Just say \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u00a0He took one last deep exhale, focused, and\u2026\nAn empty huff croaked out of Todoroki as agony suddenly cracked through his skull, and nausea slammed his body like a door in Paranormal Activity. \u00a0Holy fuck, was he having an aneurysm? \u00a0Todoroki groaned as a fresh wave of pain bowled him over, his head on the verge of imploding. \u00a0\nMidoriya appeared to be panicking, grabbing Todoroki\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0Todoroki yelped again, his side splitting. \u00a0Fucking hell, he could hardly even see Midoriya through this haze in his head. \u00a0His stomach tweaked in all the wrong ways. \u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Todoroki shouted desperately, completely involuntarily. \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s eyes, all watery, widened in confusion at his outburst. \u00a0\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel \u2018alright\u2019.\u201d\nAnd just like that, all traces of pain vanished. \u00a0What the hell?! \u00a0\n\u201cTodoroki? \u00a0S-shouto?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s voice and eyes wobbled in unison. \u00a0\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki whispered, with complete ease. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Unease settled in Todoroki\u2019s bones. \u00a0He had absolutely no idea what was happening to him. \u00a0\nAbsently, Todoroki caught a vague scent of smoke, and a breeze tickled his side. \u00a0Shit, he must have partially singed through his shirt because of the pain.\n\u201cDo you feel stable?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya implored, hands tightening their grip on Todoroki\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki replied again, perfectly fine. \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, thank heavens,\u201d Midoriya sobbed, wrapping Todoroki in a desperate hug. \u00a0Todoroki could feel the boy\u2019s heart pounding through his charred shirt, which was, well\u2026 If Todoroki didn\u2019t feel so freaked out, he certainly would\u2019ve ascended to Cloud 9 by now. \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Todoroki!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya squeezed him even tighter, hands balling up against Todoroki\u2019s back. \u00a0\u201cY-you just normally dodge punches, and I banked on that and put too much force into it, and then you started grabbing your head and smoking and curling up and oh my god it was so terrifying, and I\u2019m so sorry, and I would never ever hit you that hard on purpose, you know that right?!\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki nodded, Midoriya\u2019s soft hair tickling his chin. \u00a0He focused on the warm, solid body pressed up against his and melted into the embrace, pulse relaxing. \u00a0Whatever the hell that episode had been, it was over now. \u00a0\nExcept-- the beginnings of a headache began unfurling in Todoroki\u2019s temples and he stiffened. \u00a0As soon as he opened his mouth to suck in a nervous breath, however, he found himself murmuring \u201cOf course I know that, Izuku\u201d into Midoriya\u2019s hair. \u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s burgeoning headache dissipated as his confusion returned in full force. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t meant to say that, even though it was true. \u00a0And wait, had he just called Midoriya \u2018Izuku\u2019?\nA slight flush rose in Todoroki. \u00a0He really hadn\u2019t meant to say that. \u00a0What was happening to him?! \u00a0Maybe I do have a concussion... \u00a0 \u00a0\nTodoroki broke the hug, taking a few tentative steps back. \u00a0He still didn\u2019t entirely trust his body to not belly flop into a swimming pool of agony at any moment.\nSpecks of ash from Todoroki\u2019s shirt stuck to Midoriya\u2019s own. \u00a0The boy picked at them absently. \u00a0\u201cYou, uh, did you just call me \u2018Izuku\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cAh, um, yes.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki flushed further. \u00a0\u201cI wasn't thinking. \u00a0I'm sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s hands waved in protest. \u00a0\u201cIt's..nice. \u00a0You should call me Izuku all the time.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki breathed, quite eloquently. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI said,\u201d \u00a0oh man, apparently it was now Midoriya\u2019s turn to glow bright red, \u00a0\u201cthat you should call me Izuku. \u00a0If you want.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki replied, lamely. \u201cI do want to. And call me Shouto. -only if you want to. \u00a0Too.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you say, Shouto,\u201d Midoriya grinned, and began gathering his things. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done enough for today. I'll see you at lunch!\u201d\n\u201cYeah. See you.\u201d \u00a0\nMidoriya looked expectant. \u00a0Oh. \u00a0\u201c...Izuku.\u201d\nThe name melted pleasantly in Todoroki\u2019s mouth, like cotton candy, and Midoriya bounced on his heels.\n\u201cAnd just so you know-\u201d\nTodoroki paused with his water bottle halfway to his face, glancing at Midoriya.\n\u201cJust so you know,\u201d Midoriya repeated, eyes flickering down. \u00a0\u201cYou should, uh, put on another shirt before lunch. Yeah. Bye!\u201d\nMidoriya left, and Todoroki looked down at his tattered top, only half remaining.\nThe walk back to the locker room was occupied by Todoroki berating himself for allowing himself to think that Midoriya\u2019s cheeks had glowed ever-so-brighter with his parting comment.\nIf wishes were fishes, Todoroki could open a goddamn aquarium.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBack in the locker room, Todoroki mindlessly slipped on a fresh shirt, as if his brain had subconsciously labeled Midoriya\u2019s suggestion as its top priority. \u00a0\nIt wasn't far fetched. \u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s stomach surged softly as his mind replayed his inexplicable agony earlier, and a cold sweat broke out over his skin.\nToo freaked out to shower just yet, Todoroki collapsed onto a sink in the locker room, knuckles white as they clenched the porcelain. \u00a0What\u2019s wrong with me? \u00a0How can the headaches appear and disappear so quickly?\nMismatched eyes found themselves in the mirror, and Todoroki stared intensely at the glass, imploring his own reflection for answers.\n\n Does the pain only activate with questions, like some strange cousin of Shinsou\u2019s quirk? \u00a0But the pain only happened twice, and Midoriya definitely asked more than two questions. \n\nUnfortunately, Todoroki\u2019s reflection seemed just as confused as he was, and offered no solutions. \u00a0The glass fogged as Todoroki sighed in frustration.\n\n Is it even the work of a quirk in the first place? \u00a0I could just be getting random headaches... \u00a0Midoriya did hit me pretty hard. \n\n\u201cChecking yourself out, Todoroki?\u201d \u00a0Kirishima\u2019s grinning face joined Todoroki\u2019s in the mirror, creating a pretty decent rendition of the comedy/tragedy mask. \u00a0Todoroki stiffened - he hadn\u2019t heard his classmate enter and wasn\u2019t quite in the mood for conversation. \u00a0\n\u201cI, I wasn\u2019t checking myself out.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki felt the strange urge to clarify. \u00a0Thankfully, no tendrils of pain began unfurling in his head. \u00a0So it's not question-based?\n\u201cSure you weren\u2019t,\u201d \u00a0Kirishima grinned even wider. \u00a0\u201cBesides, I\u2019m pretty sure that the entire rest of the class has got that covered. \u00a0Hell, more like the entire rest of the country.\u201d\nWell that was...generous. \u00a0\u201cThanks?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Pretty Boy.\u201d \u00a0Kirishima crowded closer to Todoroki in the mirror, eyes scanning Todoroki\u2019s reflection. \u00a0\u201cDamn dude, speaking of that iconic face, what the hell happened to your jaw? \u00a0That\u2019s shaping up to be quite the bruise.\u201d\nAh, Kirishima was right - only then did Todoroki notice the throbbing along his jawline. \u00a0\u201cI accidentally let my guard down during my spar with Midoriya. \u00a0It was a stupid mistake.\u201d\nKirishima clapped an arm around Todoroki\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself there, everybody loves a guy with some battle scars. \u00a0It shows moxie. \u00a0Besides, I know exactly what you're talking about.\u201d \u00a0Kirishima winked.\nTodoroki simply nodded, a bit lost. \u00a0\n\u201cSo tell me, Hot Stuff - or should it be Cold Stuff? \u00a0I\u2019m gonna go with Lukewarm Stuff. \u00a0So tell me, Lukewarm Stuff, just what did Midoriya do to cost you that bruise?\u201d \u00a0He winked again. \u00a0Kirishima seemed to like winking. \u00a0\u201cMy bet is he got hot and took his shirt off.\u201d \u00a0\nSpeaking of getting hot, the air in the room suddenly felt quite oven-like, and Todoroki desperately battled three scrapbooks\u2019 worth of mental images. \u00a0Midoriya did tend to shed clothing when warm, a fact that reflected quite poorly on Todoroki\u2019s faint, gay heart. \u00a0\nTodoroki gripped the sink even tighter, refusing to encourage Kirishima with an answer. \u00a0\nKirishima bulldozed on, encouraged. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man, there's no shame here. \u00a0I of all people understand the deadly combo of shirtlessness and sweat. \u00a0It\u2019ll really get ya. \u00a0For a while I\u2019d nearly turn Katsuki down if he asked to spar because I knew I'd end up staring and leave with a game of connect-the-bruises across my body.\u201d \u00a0Kirishima hummed. \u00a0\u201cPlus, he's just really freaking good at hand-to-hand.\u201d\nTodoroki didn\u2019t even have a chance to become flustered before that terrifying, now-familiar flutter of nausea laced through his gut. \u00a0His jaw throbbed as he grit his teeth in apprehension.\nKirishima seemed to notice his unease. \u00a0\u201cWoah, dude, I\u2019m sorry if I went a little too far there. \u00a0I really am!\u201d \u00a0The nausea grew, becoming just this side of excruciating. \u00a0\u201cIn my own dumbass way, I was just trying to let you know that I\u2019ve been in your situation and I\u2019d be more than happy to-\u201d\n\u201cHis pants were tight!\u201d \u00a0Todoroki spit out, feeling the nausea recede. \u00a0\u201cMidoriya was wearing these ridiculous pants that started clinging everywhere when he sweat, and\u2026\u201d \u00a0\nA palm swung up to stop Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cSay no more. \u00a0We\u2019re more than on the same wavelength. \u00a0Katsuki likes to wear these thin tank tops that really fuck me up.\u201d \u00a0Kirishima sighed fondly. \u00a0\u201cIn a good way.\u201d\nThe mirror, helpfully, supplied Todoroki with knowledge of just how lost he looked, and Kirishima blessedly took mercy.\n\u201cI'm oversharing, aren't I?\u201d \u00a0He scratched his neck sheepishly. \u00a0\nFlatly: \u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat's my bad. \u00a0Again, I just want you to know that I've been there, and I get it. \u00a0I know you like Midoriya for way more than that sort of thing, don't worry. \u00a0Mind above the gutter, yeah?\u201d\nTodoroki opened his mouth to demand how Kirshima had figured him out, to deflect, to agree - practically anything except what actually came out. \u00a0\u201cNot all of the time, no. \u00a0I fantasize about Midoriya quite regularly, sometimes even in my dreams.\u201d \u00a0\nOh god, oh hell no. \u00a0Why did he keep saying stuff like this, stuff that was way too...personal? \u00a0And true, disgustingly true. \u00a0Kirishima, bless him, just laughed awkwardly.\nTodoroki turned red and away from Kirishima, snatching up his things. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m. \u00a0I'll be in my room. \u00a0Alright bye.\u201d\nKirishima didn't even protest.\nOutside of the locker room, Todoroki collapsed against the wall, clutching his water bottle to his heaving chest.\nJust what - to reiterate - the actual fuck was going on?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt took two flights of stairs for Todoroki\u2019s own post-workout stench to pierce through the cloud of mild panic surrounding his brain.\nIt took the next flight of stairs for Todoroki to decide that he didn't give a single shit, and that his one and only goal at this point was to retreat to safety of his room so he could think.\nOn the fourth flight of stairs, Todoroki finished the last of his water, throat clogged like a BP pipeline as embarrassment over his incident with Midoriya resurfaced. \u00a0He screwed the cap of his bottle back on clumsily. \u00a0Just focus on getting back. \u00a0\nOnly the fifth flight of stairs remained between Todoroki and victory when it was cruelly yanked out from under him, in the form of three chattering figures entering the stairwell.\n\u201c- only has a shelf life of like a week, but he still ate the whole pack! \u00a0Oh, hey, Todoroki!\u201d \u00a0Ashido greeted enthusiastically.\nRight behind Ashido, Uraraka waved with a friendly smile. \u00a0Tokoyami, somewhat unexpectedly, rounded out the trio, nodding cooly at Todoroki.\n\u201cWhat incident has befallen your face, Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201c...Hello, Tokoyami. \u00a0And I got punched during training today. \u00a0Nothing exciting.\u201d \u00a0The girls oooo\u2019ed sympathetically. \u00a0 Please just let me go, Todoroki prayed, eyes flickering nervously over the trio. \u00a0\n\u201cSo, Uraraka and I were having a debate, and we need your opinion.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s eyebrow twitched, ever so slightly.\nIf Ashido noticed, she didn\u2019t care. \u00a0\u201cUraraka \u00a0here thinks - very sadly, in my opinion - that a Frosty is better than a McFlurry, and I need you to be the voice of reason here.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves here\u2026\u201d \u00a0Uraraka countered, before Todoroki could even respond. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the way that you just  assumed  \u00a0Todoroki would choose the McFlurry, and how you  insinuated \u00a0that it was the \u2018reasonable\u2019 answer.\u201d \u00a0Her voice raised with genuine conviction. \u00a0\u201cNeed I remind you that a Frosty is only 99 yen?! \u00a0Hell, you couldn\u2019t find a better deal than that if you -\u201d \u00a0\nThe doorway to the fifth floor taunted Todoroki as he tuned the conversation out; just mere meters away. \u00a0He even tried inching towards it, until Ashido grasped his forearm with surprising strength.\n\u201cPlease, Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0her eyes blazed. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re like, one of the smartest dudes in class. \u00a0Set the record straight, once and for all.\u201d\nAshido\u2019s grip tightened. \u00a0Todoroki frowned slightly. \u00a0\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just ask Tokoyami?\u201d \u00a0\nBoth girls scoffed in unison. \u00a0\u201cAs if! \u00a0That weirdo gets salads at fast food restaurants.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy grease,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami stated, arms folded primly.\n\u201cSee what we\u2019re dealing with! \u00a0You gotta help us, Todoroki. \u00a0Which is better, the McFlurry or Frosty?\u201d\nTodoroki opened his mouth, fully intent on just picking one at random and retreating upstairs, but what came out instead was: \u00a0\u201cI have never had either.\u201d\nTwin gasps echoed up the stairs. \u00a0Even Tokoyami appeared shocked. \u00a0\u201cTodoroki, what kind of depraved life have you been leading?\u201d\n\u201cA lonely one,\u201d \u00a0he blurted truthfully, yet again.\u00a0 What is wrong with me? \u00a0 He really needed time to think, not -\n\u201cTodoroki, I vow to save you from your tragic depravity!\u201d \u00a0Ashido declared passionately, clasping his hand. \u00a0\n- not this, this  tomfoolery. \u00a0Todoroki shook off Ashido\u2019s grip. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I must decline. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n \u2018busy\u2019.  \u00a0 Nope, the word refused to exit his mouth. \u00a0  \u2018tired\u2019\u00a0  \u00a0and  \u2018sick\u2019\u00a0 \u00a0met a similar fate. \u00a0Todoroki startled as his left temple throbbed.\n\u201c...sweaty,\u201d \u00a0he finished quickly, lamely. \u00a0\u201cI, um, still need to shower.\u201d\n\u201cWe just learned that you\u2019ve never had a McFlurry  or\u00a0 Frosty, and your mind is on showering?\u201d \u00a0Uraraka looked affronted.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, that\u2019s just too bad.\u201d \u00a0Uraraka crossed her arms resolutely. \u00a0\u201cBecause you\u2019re gonna come join us on our fast food run, right now, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d\n\u201cBesides instantly freeze all of us in place,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami muttered. \u00a0Uraraka glared at him.\n\u201cNo,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki added more firmness to his voice. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d really rather not, right now. \u00a0Besides, if I don't shower I'll gross people out.\u201d\nAshido scoffed. \u00a0\u201cAs if  you could gross people out. \u00a0Besides, body odor is practically celebrated at fast food restaurants.\u201d \u00a0She put her hands on her hips. \u00a0\u201cHave you even had lunch today?\u201d\n\u201c...No.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry, then?\u201d\nOf course, Todoroki\u2019s stomach took that precise moment to grumble loudly. \u00a0He sighed. \u00a0\u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u00a0Damn traitorous organs.\n\u201cBetrayal often comes from those closest to us, perhaps even from ourselves.\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami noted, sagely. \u00a0\nAshido blinked. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to go, then let\u2019s get on with it,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki interjected. \u00a0Seeing no way out, he had no choice but to embrace his plight and adapt. \u00a0Now, his goal was expediency. \u00a0\nUraraka and Ashido cheered, grabbing Todoroki\u2019s hands and dragging him down the stairs. \u00a0Tokoyami followed, murmuring something to himself about knives and backs.\n Just stay calm, Shouto. \u00a0It\u2019ll all turn out fine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlessedly, their destination was a mere five minute walk from campus, no trains required. \u00a0Todoroki felt relieved, especially considering the obnoxious passengers that morning. \u00a0And his captors had at least had the decency to let him drop off his bag in the men's community bathroom. \u00a0The sun warmed Todoroki's back pleasantly as he walked, and he inhaled deeply.\nIt was still a beautiful day, if nothing else. \u00a0\nUraraka traced his line of vision, landing on the feathery clouds. \u00a0She smiled. \u00a0\u201cDo you like the summertime, Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d \u00a0The sun broke from behind its cloudy gate, and Todoroki had to redirect his gaze to the road. \u00a0\u201cA lot of people complain about the heat, but I can just keep myself comfortable with my quirk.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so awesome! \u00a0And so unfair!\u201d \u00a0Ashido pouted. \u00a0\nTodoroki shrugged.\n\u201cThe only thing that makes life unfair is the delusion that it should be fair.\u201d\nAshido rolled her eyes. \u00a0\u201cShut up, Tokoyami, you have a freaking invincible shadow bird living inside of you.\u201d \u00a0\nDespite himself, Todoroki found a smile pushing at the corner of his lips.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGolden arches cast an imposing shadow on the foursome, shimmering in the sunlight.\n\u201cOh, I understand now,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki muttered, mostly to himself. \u00a0\u201cThe \u2018Mc\u2019 in McFlurry is a reference to McDonalds.\u201d\nUraraka eyed him warily. \u00a0\u201cI mean, yeah... How has someone as smart as you never put that together?\u201d\nTodoroki hummed. \u00a0\u201cProbably because I\u2019ve never been to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d \u00a0\nThe synchronized shriek literally scared birds from their roosts on a telephone wire, wings flapping wildly. \u00a0A flight-type quirk suddenly seemed very appealing to Todoroki.\n\u201cI said, I\u2019ve never been to McDona-\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, we got that.\u201d \u00a0Uraraka threw her hands up. \u00a0\u201cHow not, though?! \u00a0Were you raised under a rock?\u201d\n\u201cNo. \u00a0I was raised in my home.\u201d\nUraraka simply gaped at him. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat a mad banquet of darkness,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami supplied.\n\u201cHey, now, we need to look at this as an opportunity!\u201d \u00a0Ashido threw her arms over Uraraka\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s shoulders convivially. \u00a0\u201cWe get to be the ones to see Mr. Blue Blood here pop his fast food cherry.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki cringed at the comparison, shaking off Ashido\u2019s embrace. \u00a0\u201cUraraka, Tokoyami, we have truly been blessed on this day.\"\n\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d \u00a0Uraraka smiled. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go, then! \u00a0We should make Todoroki eat a McRib.\u201d\n Blessed, huh? \u00a0Todoroki braced himself as they approached the restaurant, the vast unknown lying just behind smudged glass doors. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first thing to hit Todoroki was the smell, a pungent mix of delight and horror. \u00a0He could practically taste the grease in the air. \u00a0\n\u201cSo, Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0Ashido nudged his side. \u00a0\u201cFirst impressions?\u201d\nMismatched eyes scanned the spectacle before him. \u00a0\u201cThe space is somewhat\u2026 cluttered, yet also efficient. \u00a0The smell is also quite thick.\u201d\n\u201cAhh, that\u2019s the golden aroma of their \u2018World Famous Fries\u2019.\u201d \u00a0Uraraka clasped her chest. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re heavenly.\u201d\nA bold claim, certainly. \u00a0Todoroki turned his attention to the menu boards. \u00a0And was promptly stunned. \u00a0\u201cHoly hell, everything is so cheap!\"\n\u201cWow, Todoroki, that might be the most emotion I\u2019ve heard in your voice, like, ever,\u201d \u00a0Ashido joked.\nUraraka was delighted. \u00a0\u201cI know, right, Todoroki? \u00a0It\u2019s perfect for a broke high school student like me.\u201d\nTodoroki made a tactical decision not to mention his vast checking account. \u00a0\n\u201cSo, what do you think you\u2019ll get?\u201d\nTodoroki scanned the menu once more. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still deciding.\u201d\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d \u00a0Ashido nodded reassuringly. \u00a0\u201cNobody\u2019s first time should be rushed.\u201d\n\u201cMine was,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami said, and was met with complete silence. \u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ready to order,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki declared, strategically.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUraraka ordered a Big Mac, a \u2018splurge\u2019 in her words, which made Todoroki even more secure in his decision not to draw attention to his finances. \u00a0Ashido took the road less travelled by ordering McNuggets, and Tokoyami remained true to his values by ordering a salad. \u00a0\nTodoroki stepped up to the counter, inexplicably nervous. \u00a0He had faced countless villains, defeated the infamous Hero Killer, even taken two freaking knives to the arm, yet here he was, stumbling over the order he had rehearsed seven times in his head.\n\u201cA, um, quarter pounder with cheese. \u00a0Except, can I take off the onions, mustard, and onions? \u00a0Damn, I meant - ah shit, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to cuss. \u00a0And a small fountain frink -  drink \u00a0- please.\u201d\nTodoroki wanted to die. \u00a0The cashier, a girl about his age with bright green eyes, smiled benevolently. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. \u00a0So, no onion or mustard?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please. \u00a0And no pickle. \u00a0Please.\u201d \u00a0The girl\u2019s nametag read \u2018Suzuki\u2019, decorated with little squiggles.\n\u201cSo demanding,\u201d \u00a0she joked, eyeing Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cBut I can make it happen. \u00a0Has anybody ever told you that you have incredible eyes?\u201d\nBehind him, Uraraka stopped munching on her fries. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki replied. \u00a0\u201cOne of my doctors said heterochromia affects less than .67% of the population, so I was an \u2018incredible\u2019 case.\u201d\nSuzuki giggled, much to Todoroki\u2019s confusion. \u00a0He\u2019d been serious. \u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re quite a standout, huh?\u201d \u00a0She leaned onto her cash register.\n\u201cStatistically, yes.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cMmm,\u201d \u00a0her green eyes flashed, and Todoroki found himself enjoying their color.\u00a0 Old habits.  \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019re the odds of me getting your number, then?\u201d\nTodoroki stared down at his order ticket, #73. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d say 100%. \u00a0Don\u2019t I need to give it to you to get my food?\u201d\nAshido choked on her drink. \u00a0\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d \u00a0Suzuki soldiered on. \u00a0\u201cBut I was more talking about your phone number.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d \u00a0Green eyes occupied Todoroki\u2019s attention again, but this time they didn\u2019t belong to Suzuki. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d, um, prefer not to.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cAw, damn,\u201d \u00a0Suzuki sighed, but good-naturedly. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t say I'm surprised, though. \u00a0Already got a special somebody?\u201d\nA spotlight may as well have been shone on Todoroki. \u00a0No signs of movement were evident behind Todoroki, and he could practically feel Uraraka, Ashido, and Tokoyami\u2019s eyes on the back of his head. \u00a0\nTodoroki may not have any idea what the hell was going on, but he knew questions initiated what the kids called a Bad Time. \u00a0Sure enough, a godforsaken throbbing emerged in Todoroki\u2019s temples, and he stiffened.\n\u201cI, um.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki unconsciously crumbled his order ticket in his fist. \u00a0\u201cThat depends on what you mean by \u2018already got\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cAhh.\u201d \u00a0Suzuki winced sympathetically. \u00a0\u201cYou stuck in the friend zone?\u201d\nCrap, another question. \u00a0And a painful one, at that. \u00a0\u201cIt...seems that way,\u201d Todoroki forced.\n\u201cWell, I think they\u2019re missing the hell out, whoever they are. \u00a0They must be crazy to pass up on a .67 in a hundred guy like you.\u201d\nSuzuki was smiling, and the sincere kindness in her green eyes made Todoroki sigh -  a little close to home. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Crazy\u2019 isn't too far off, actually.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s mad grin at their first sports festival flashed through Todoroki\u2019s head, and fondness traced the fairest hint of a smile on his lips. \u00a0\u201cThanks.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d \u00a0Suzuki winked, and handed him a bag that was practically dripping with grease. \u00a0\u201cTry not to get diabetes too quickly, now.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnexpectedly, Todoroki made it a solid four bites into his burger before the interrogation began.\nThe first introduced Todoroki to the surprisingly delicious taste of the famed Big Mac, and he give himself a split second to surrender himself to the lovely flavor of grease before switching gears to more pressing matters. \u00a0\nBite two was marked by the illumination of a mental lightbulb. \u00a0His inability to make excuses, his adverse reaction to avoiding questions...there was no way it was just coincidence, it  couldn't\u00a0be.\nBy bite three, Todoroki was convinced - as crazy as it sounded - that he was unable to lie. \u00a0He didn't know how, or why, or even if his theory was correct, but the puzzle pieces seemed to point to that, if not a very similar, picture. \u00a0\nA picture where Todoroki was trapped with two talkative classmates and a shadow demon\u2019s host in a fast food chain, unable to dodge questions or rely on trusty old Awkward Silence.\nBite four was quite hard to swallow.\nNow - cue the interrogation. \u00a0\n\u201cSooo, Todoroki\u2026\u201d \u00a0Ashido grinned, dangerously, and Todoroki could already hear the funeral bells. \u00a0\u201cYou like someone, huh?\u201d\nHe forced his bite of burger down. \u00a0\u201cYes. \u00a0And wasn\u2019t the whole point of this trip to make fun of my reaction to fast food or something?\u201d\nYes, change the subject. \u00a0Easy. \u00a0He could do this.\n\u201cOriginally, yeah.\u201d \u00a0Ashido leaned forward. \u00a0\u201cBut now, there are more pressing matters to attend to.\u201d\nDamn, he couldn't do this. \u00a0\n\u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t noticed before?\u201d \u00a0Uraraka rolled her eyes. \u00a0\u201cYou just saw a perfect example of Todoroki\u2019s social prowess, and you think he\u2019d be able to hide a crush?\u201d\nAshido burst out laughing, spewing bits of chicken nuggets. \u00a0\u201cOh my god, your little eye statistics. \u00a0My abs were  aching.\u201d\n\u201cI, too, felt I underwent a satisfactory abdominal workout.\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami -  that traitor \u00a0- pitched in. \u00a0\nTodoroki frowned. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m right here, you know.\u201d\n\u201c...No offense.\u201d \u00a0Uraraka patted his arm.\n\u201cUraraka makes a good point.\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami dapped at the ranch on his beak with a napkin. \u00a0\u201cTodoroki does not interact naturally with people, like oil suspended in a sea of water.\u201d\nThe burger in Todoroki\u2019s hands sagged.\n\u201cThe both of you are right,\u201d \u00a0Ashido nodded. \u00a0\u201cWhich is why we need to help him! \u00a0Todoroki, who do you like?\u201d\nTodoroki panicked, dropping his burger with a wet flop. \u00a0Like hell he was going to tell this peanut gallery!\u00a0 Knowing Ashido, she'd probably take it upon herself to lock Todoroki and Midoriya in a closet until they made out, or something. \u00a0A definite no-go. \u00a0\n\u201cSomeone in our class.\u201d \u00a0Alright, no pain jumpkicked Todoroki\u2019s skull - vague answers seemed to check out.\n\u201cWell, duh.\u201d \u00a0Ashido flapped her hand. \u00a0\u201cDo you even keep up with anybody our age outside of U.A.?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nWow, this quirk was kind of -\n\u201cAny friends from childhood?\u201d\n\u201c...No.\u201d\n-depressing. \u00a0\n\u201cOh, ok!\u201d \u00a0Ashido tried to recover with forced enthusiasm. \u00a0\u201cI'm glad that we get to be your first friends, then! \u00a0You've had fun, I hope?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cOnce I got past the initial awkwardness, yes, I have made several fond memories,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki babbled, then inwardly groaned. \u00a0He was oversharing. \u00a0It must be part of the condition.\nUraraka raised an eyebrow. \u00a0\u201cWhat initial awkwardness?\u201d\n\u201cDuring first year, I had absolutely no idea how to interact with people my age. \u00a0Once, I accidentally called Kouda \u2018Gouda\u2019, like the cheese, and I was too embarrassed to talk to him again for four months. \u00a0That's just one example.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka whispered. \u00a0\u201cHe always asked us if we thought that you were trying to intimidate him.\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki groaned - outwardly, this time. \u00a0\u201cI'm the worst. \u00a0How am I ever supposed to become close with M- er, my crush if I can't even flirt with a random cashier?\u201d\nHe didn't know why he was actively slapping his heart on his sleeve like this - maybe it had to do with his current predisposition towards honesty - but he allowed himself to continue.\n\u201cI'm just, I never have any idea what the hell I\u2019m doing, and they're so, so  incredible, so far out of my league that it\u2019s laughable. \u00a0I don't even know how to begin.\u201d \u00a0\nUraraka patted his shoulder. \u00a0\u201cI can't be sure who you're talking about, Todoroki, but that cashier was right. \u00a0You can't sell yourself short. \u00a0And I don't just mean appearance-wise,\u201d \u00a0she teased.\n\u201cYou'll always have good ole Twitter as a confidence booster,\u201d \u00a0Ashido added, sagely. \u00a0\n\u201cInner beauty is great, but a little mascara never hurt.\u201d\nTodoroki blinked. \u00a0\u201cBut I don't even wear make-up?\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka chimed in, \u00a0\u201cwhat Tokoyami was trying to say is that you're the whole package, Todoroki! \u00a0Whoever it is that you're interested in, you should tell them how you feel!\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d \u00a0Ashido balled a fist in conviction. \u00a0\u201cLove is the spice of life! \u00a0What have you got to lose?\u201d\n\u201cA meaningful friendship, a large chunk of self-confidence, the relative ease of interaction between my crush and I, and a huge amount of sleep.\u201d\n\u201cWell, alright, it sounds pretty dismal when you put it that way. \u00a0But between you and me, Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka leaned over to whisper to Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cIf it\u2019s a certain green-eyed dude with no sense of self-preservation like I think it is, then I wouldn't worry about it at all. \u00a0If I were you.\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s heart bungee jumped into his gut, springing back up into his throat. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0he choked.\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka smirked.\n\u201cAnd I didn't!\u201d \u00a0Ashido protested loudly. \u00a0\u201cSecrets are no fair. \u00a0Right, Tokoyami?\u201d \u00a0She grabbed his shoulders and started whispering obvious gibberish into the side of his head. \u00a0\u201cWait, do you even have ears?\u201d\nTodoroki took in the scene absently, mind still hooked on the fact that Uraraka, one of Midoriya\u2019s closest friends, felt confident that Midoriya, well...Todoroki wasn\u2019t quite sure, actually, but it was definitely good news, no matter how vague. \u00a0Right?\n\u201cSo, Todoroki, how are you gonna confess?\u201d \u00a0Ashido asked, yanking Todoroki\u2019s attention back before he could delve too deep into fantasy over Uraraka\u2019s words. \u00a0\u201cAre you gonna go for a classic approach like a rooftop or just suddenly dip her into a kiss one day?\u201d\nAnd just like that, Todoroki plunged neck deep into fantasy again. \u00a0\u201cI, I.\u201d \u00a0His ears burned. \u00a0\u201cNo, I'm not planning to do either.\u201d\u00a0 \u2018Her\u2019 , Ashido had said, and Todoroki deemed it in his best strategic interest to not correct her. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAww, boo.\u201d \u00a0Ashido gave a thumbs down. \u00a0\u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t even told me who it is, which is a double boo.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not boo Todoroki too harshly now,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka - his beautiful, shining guardian angel - intervened. \u00a0\u201cNot everybody likes to share like Kirishima.\u201d\n\u201cBakuuu~\u201d \u00a0Ashido crooned, and Tokoyami smiled into his salad.\n\u201cExactly. \u00a0So, for the sake of privacy, let\u2019s call Todoroki\u2019s mystery crush by a codename. \u00a0Like Toyota!\u201d\nAnd just like that, the guardian angel lost her wings. \u00a0\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019d rather not talk at all about...Toyota.\u201d\n\u201cThey have excellent crash safety ratings,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami said.\n\u201cThe same can\u2019t be said for Todoroki\u2019s Toyota,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka mumbled, and Todoroki glared at her.\u00a0\n\u201cI think this Toyota talk has been a long time coming, Todoroki.\u201d \u00a0Ashido rested her chin in her hands. \u00a0\u201cI mean, what was your plan? \u00a0Were you just gonna live your life infatuated with someone from the sidelines, staring at them longingly like some really cute outfit in a shop window that you know you\u2019ll never be able to afford so you just cry in bed at night thinking about how great it would have looked on you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat a concise simile,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami sniped.\nTodoroki sighed. \u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0Because that was the truth, wasn't it? \u00a0If he kept going as he was, he and Midoriya\u2019s fates were sealed as parallel rather than intertwined. \u00a0Somehow, admitting it out loud made Todoroki feel rather\u2026\n\u201cLame.\u201d \u00a0Ashido tutted. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s pretty lame, dude. \u00a0No offense.\u201d\n \u201cNone taken,\u201d\u00a0 Todoroki attempted, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out.\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy to help! \u00a0If you want, I can lock you and Toyota in a storage room closet or something until you inevitably start making out.\u201d\nAaand there it was. \u00a0\n\u201cIn my opinion, you should scribe this Toyota a heartfelt letter, spill your very soul onto the ink, and deliver it personally with care so that you may await their response with bated breath.\u201d\nTodoroki relaxed a bit. \u00a0That scenario actually sounded quite pleasant, really. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the advice, Tokoyami.\u201d\nTokoyami nodded. \u00a0\u201cOf course, after receiving your joyous response, you shall then proceed to make out, passionately.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is everyone so adamant that I make out with T...Toyota?!\u201d \u00a0A nearby customer shot Todoroki a concerned look, and he debating sinking under the table. \u00a0\nUraraka laughed as Ashido grinned. \u00a0\u201cAww, Todoroki, you're blushing! \u00a0Thinking about swapping spit with Toyota?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d \u00a0Todoroki croaked, and fuck his voice for cracking, honestly. \u00a0\u201cAnd holding hands, and cuddling, and sparring until we fall on top of each other like always, but this time I\u2019ll actually move forward and, um. \u00a0Nevermind.\u201d\n\u201cSo you  have\u00a0thought about it, after all?\u201d \u00a0Ashido looked triumphant.\n\u201cOf course I've thought about it.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s voice softened. \u00a0\u201cI've thought about it every night for nearly two years.\u201d\nFor a few moments, Todoroki\u2019s only response was the beeping of cash registers and whir of industrial air conditioning.\n\u201cTwo years?\u201d \u00a0\nAnd if Uraraka had sounded incredulous, Todoroki couldn't find it in him to blame her, because it was kind of shocking, really. \u00a0Admitting aloud just how long he'd had feelings for Midoriya made it seem all the longer, all the more real. \u00a0\u201cYeah. \u00a0Pretty long, huh.\u201d\nThe cash registers kept on beeping. \u00a0Todoroki sighed. \u00a0\nThen jumped out of his own skin when Ashido slammed her fist onto her plastic tray, voice raised in conviction. \u00a0\u201cThen that's all the more reason to make a move! \u00a0You\u2019re gonna go back to school, and you're gonna ask Toyota out! \u00a0Now, who are you?\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki Shouto,\u201d \u00a0he whispered, still a little alarmed.\n\u201cNope, you gotta say it like you mean it. \u00a0Now, who are you?!\u201d\n\u201c...Todoroki Shouto!\u201d \u00a0Another customer glared their way, and Todoroki shrank into his seat.\n\u201cDamn straight you are! \u00a0And now that that's settled, the three of us are gonna help you make all your dreams come true. \u00a0Right?\u201d\n\u201cRight!\u201d \u00a0Uraraka giggled. \u00a0Tokoyami inclined his head. \u00a0\nTodoroki felt embarrassed, helpless, and a tap on his shoulder as a girl with navy blue hair suddenly appeared at their table, with impressive stealth. \u00a0\u201cDid you say that you're Todoroki Shouto?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d \u00a0Ashido exclaimed, still in motivation-mode as Todoroki confirmed his identity with a sinking feeling. \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d \u00a0Navy Hair squealed, and retreated to another table, chock-full of prepubescent girls. \u00a0She pointed in their direction, and a dissonant chorus of shrieks followed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d\nUraraka pouted. \u00a0\u201cBut we didn\u2019t even get you a McFlurry-\u201d\n\"Now.\u201d\nWhen the gaggle of girls arrived at Todoroki\u2019s table, their only greeting was three unused ketchup packets.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe walk home was marked by a tempest in Todoroki\u2019s gut, and he wasn't sure how much he could blame on the Big Mac.\nAshido and Tokoyami occupied themselves arguing over the fine line between goth and scene, and Uraraka turned to face Todoroki, brown hair swaying. \u00a0\n\u201cIs it nice to constantly run into hordes of fans?\u201d\n\u201cNo. \u00a0In fact, their ever-increasing presence has put me on edge in public lately, and I get nervous.\u201d\n\u201c...Oh.\u201d\nSilence reigned after that, excepting Ashido and Tokoyami\u2019s heated debate, and Todoroki sighed into the warm air. \u00a0Christ, what a mess this whole impromptu affair had been, from the cashier, to customers likely thinking that Todoroki had a hard-on for his car, to Uraraka telling Todoroki not to worry about liking Midoriya. \u00a0\n Wait. \u00a0Todoroki stopped in his tracks, then zeroed in on the messenger herself, walking with her hands in her pockets. \u00a0\n\u201cUraraka,\u201d \u00a0he called, jogging slightly to catch up. \u00a0\u201cYou remember what you said earlier about me not needing to worry about Midoriya?\u201d\nShe twirled her hair with her pointer finger. \u00a0\u201cAh, yeah, I do.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any way you could explain what you meant?\u201d \u00a0he asked, failing to tamp out an excited edge as his stupid, smitten brain began anticipating her response, jumping to conclusions.\n \u201cYes, of course, Todoroki!\u201d  \u00a0Dream Uraraka beamed. \u00a0\u201cI was just saying that Midoriya is deeply in love with you and wants to date immediately and kiss in the locker room and let you play with his hair!\u201d \nReal Uraraka opened her mouth. \u00a0Todoroki felt his chest flutter. \u00a0\u201cNope,\u201d \u00a0she stated - simply, devastatingly. \u00a0\nTodoroki could practically hear his hopes shattering.\nUraraka must have heard it, too, because she smiled sympathetically. \u00a0\u201cI'm sorry, Todoroki, but I made a promise that I fully intend to keep. \u00a0I\u2019ve already run my mouth too much. \u00a0You\u2019re a smart guy, though. \u00a0I\u2019m 100% sure you\u2019ll be able to work things out on your own.\u201d \u00a0Her smile shifted into an encouraging one.\n\u201cBut-\u201d \u00a0A buzz in Todoroki\u2019s pocket cut him off, and he pulled out his phone.\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya Izuku: \n\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0how\u2019s the face??? \n\n\u00a0\nTodoroki kept his phone close to his chest, inexplicably nervous. \u00a0It buzzed again.\n\u00a0\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0hopefully not too bruised to keep random hordes of girls from attacking \n\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; or maybe thats a good thing ? \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got you all smiley, Todor- oh my god.\u201d \u00a0Ashido peered at the phone cradled against his chest and broke out into a dangerous grin. \u00a0Suddenly, his nerves didn\u2019t seem so inexplicable anymore. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re texting Toyota, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nShit. \u00a0Todoroki may just end up shoved into a closet with Midoriya, yet. \u00a0\u201c..Yeah.\u201d\nBefore Todoroki could even react, Tokoyami appeared out of genuine fucking nowhere beside Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya Izuku,\u201d \u00a0he reported, straightlaced, straightforward, straight to the point. \u00a0\nThe common syllable, of course, being in direct opposition to a certain Todoroki Tidbit that had just been exposed to an incredulous Ashido, her black eyes popping.\n\u201cNo freaking way\u2026\u201d \u00a0She abandoned Uraraka to join Tokoyami beside Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cHoly shit,\u201d \u00a0she whispered, eyes glued to the phone. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been such a fool - I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see it. \u00a0The gym fire makes so much sense now!\u201d\n\u201cThe important thing is that nobody got hurt!\u201d \u00a0Uraraka piped up, across from the three of them.\n\u201cLet\u2019s really not talk about that, please.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Todoroki, there are more important things to attend to. \u00a0Like the fact that the Twitter heartthrob himself bats for the other team. \u00a0I think we should take a moment of silence for all the broken hearts of Todoroki\u2019s fangirls,\u201d \u00a0Ashido stated solemnly.\nTokoyami bowed his head in respect. \u00a0Uraraka missed the entire point by laughing.\nAnd Todoroki just stood helplessly, the conversation completely out of his control.\nThen leapt out of his skin when his phone was swiftly swiped from his hand, Ashido whooping victoriously. \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna text him~\u201d \u00a0she sang, and fear drenched Todoroki\u2019s very core. \u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he pled, desperately.\n\u201cDo,\u201d she retorted, mercilessly. \u00a0\u201cNow which pickup line should I send him: the appendix one or the bandaid one?\u201d\n\u201cI enjoy the appendix one,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami voted, and Todoroki knew it was only a matter of seconds before his most valued friendship lay in shambles.\u00a0 It was pure adrenaline, then, that made him lunge. \u00a0Pure survival instinct that made him grab for the phone, right as Ashido was typing.\nAshido -  damn her \u00a0- dodged, holding the phone behind her back and cackling. \u00a0Todoroki lunged again, seemingly to the right, but then changing to the left at the last moment. \u00a0With a loud smack, he took hold of the top of the phone.\n\u201cThat was a well-executed feint,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami praised.\nThe perpetrator squawked, but maintained her grip. \u00a0Todoroki yanked at the device - Christ, was Uraraka literally on the ground laughing in the background? - yanked with all his might.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d \u00a0Ashido gasped, eyes twinkling a bit too much for her intentions to be merely altruistic.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be helped by talking like Kaminari!\u201d \u00a0\nAshido snorted at that, losing focus just enough for Todoroki to concentrate all his strength into one final tug. \u00a0\nThe phone - he\u2019d gotten it back! \u00a0Todoroki released a huge sigh of relief and stuffed it into his pocket.\nThen stiffened as a muffled, disembodied voice trickled from his pocket.\u00a0 \u201cHello?\u201d \nSwearing under his breath, Todoroki pulled out the godforsaken device. \u00a0A full-screen photo of a smiling Midoriya affronted him, along with the knowledge that he must have accidentally dialed Midoriya up during his struggle with Ashido.\nFucking  hell, couldn\u2019t the universe cut him a single break?!\n\u201cShouto? \u00a0Are you there?\u201d\n\u201cYep!\u201d \u00a0His voice squeaked out on the wrong side of puberty, and Uraraka fell back down onto the street.\n \u201cShouto?\u201d \u00a0 Ashido mouthed, waggling her eyebrows suggestively. \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s cheeks glowed red. \u00a0Of course they\u2019d be able to hear Midoriya talking.\n\u201cOh alright! \u00a0It seemed like you may have called on accident.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. \u00a0That\u2019s because I did.\u201d\n\u201cOh, haha.\u201d\n\u201cHa, yeah.\u201d\nTodoroki stood there awkwardly, toeing at the road. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat inspiring dialogue,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami deadpanned.\n\u201cFor real, dude, this is horrible,\u201d \u00a0Ashido whispered fiercely. \u00a0\u201cSay something funny. \u00a0Flirt!\u201d\nAs if he could  ever pull that off. \u00a0Todoroki consulted the asphalt, mind coming up blank. \u00a0\u201cSo, uh, do you prefer a Frosty or McFlurry?\u201d\nOh god, he instantly regretted that one. \u00a0Uraraka, who had only just stood back up, collapsed against a (rightfully) unimpressed Ashido, shaking violently. \u00a0\n\u201cProbably a Frosty. \u00a0They\u2019re cheaper.\u201d \u00a0From her slump on top of Ashido, Uraraka fist pumped. \u00a0\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually never had either.\u201d\n\u201cOh! \u00a0Haha, that\u2019s too bad. \u00a0To be honest though, I can\u2019t really remember the last time I had either.\u201d\n\u201cAsk him on a date!!\u201d \u00a0Ashido whisper-yelled.\nTokoyami nodded. \u00a0\u201cA perfect tactical opening.\u201d\nBut instead of doing just that, of following perhaps the only sound advice he\u2019d been offered all day, Todoroki glared and covered his free ear. \u00a0He\u2019d had it to hell and back with making a fool of himself publicly.\n\u201cI know, I know, the tragedy must have shocked you into silence,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya joked, and Todoroki felt fuzzy.\n\u201cAh, not quite.\u201d\nMidoriya laughed. \u00a0The fuzziness increased. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s cold.\u201d\nForgetting his audience, Todoroki hummed. \u00a0\u201cMaybe, sometimes cold is a good thing.\u201d\nA muffled cough echoed through the receiver. \u00a0\u201cOf course I like - I mean, cold things are awesome. \u00a0And hot things too! \u00a0Like, uh, I enjoy the winter and summer a lot separately, so if they came together or something it would be amazing. \u00a0Yep.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so in there,\u201d \u00a0Ashido giggled.\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami agreed, and Uraraka flashed the OK gesture with a huge grin. \u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s face blazed even brighter. \u00a0It was high time to end this call before he slipped up again.\n\u201cAlright, well I think I\u2019m going to go now. \u00a0Sorry for bothering you.\u201d\n\u201cYou never bother me, Shouto,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s voice crackled cheerfully, and Ashido awww\u2019ed. \u00a0\u201cSeeya later!\u201d\n\u201cBye, love you.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki hung up calmly.\n...\n...\nThen promptly dropped his phone, swaying violently on his feet. \u00a0\nDark Shadow instantly darted out to catch the phone, and Todoroki would\u2019ve been grateful if it wasn\u2019t for the tiny little fact that his entire world had just ended. \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d \u00a0he whispered distantly. \u00a0\nNearly instantly, his phone buzzed again, and when Todoroki made no move to take it, to react in any way, to continue living, Uraraka grabbed it herself.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d \u00a0he repeated. \u00a0Even Dark Shadow seemed to be cringing in secondhand embarrassment. \u00a0\n\u201cDeku wants to, uh,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka spoke softly, like a paramedic to a victim in shock. \u00a0\u201cHe wants to know if you said that by accident.\u201d \u00a0Then, more to herself. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s probably halfway to actual physical combustion.\u201d\n\u201cOh my  god.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki swayed again, still a little hung up on the most mortifying blunder in his entire life. \u00a0This made the gym fire look like Sunday brunch. \u00a0\u201cI just, I just told Midoriya that I\u2019m in love with him. \u00a0Then hung up.\u201d\n\u201cThe instant hang up was a little cruel. \u00a0Although I guess I have to respect just going for it like that. \u00a0Even if it wasn\u2019t romantic at all. \u00a0Like, at  all.\u201d \nTodoroki faced Ashido with panicked eyes. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say it! \u00a0It, it was just on my mind and it slipped out on its own and\u2026\u201d\n Wait. \u00a0A predilection to say what he was thinking\u2026\n\u201cFuck,\u201d \u00a0he groaned, with real feeling. \u00a0\nMeanwhile, Uraraka\u2019s own phone began buzzing up a storm, and she raised her eyebrows as she scanned the messages. \u00a0\u201cYou really should explain yourself, Todoroki. \u00a0Before cardiac arrest comes into play.\u201d\nShit, she was right. \u00a0Numbly, he took back his phone and opened his text window with Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0hey did i hear u wrong or did u just say \u2018love u\u2019 hahahahahah \n\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0thats pretty funny dude, A+ joke, 10/10, top of the line there buddy \n\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0it was just like by habit right?? \u00a0Right????? \n\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0once i called all might Dad ahahahancxknvkvnxd can u believe it?? \u00a0hes not actually my dad !!1! \u00a0crazy! \n\nThen, curiously, a message of all blank spaces.\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0I\u2019m sorry about those prior messages, Shouto! \u00a0I\u2019d appreciate it greatly if you disregarded them :) \u00a0Thank you! \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need to change schools,\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Todoroki croaked, shriveling inside. \u00a0Why, oh why hadn\u2019t he just stuck with the appendix pickup line?\n\u201cBefore you do that, though, could you please text Deku back?\u201d \u00a0Uraraka glanced at her phone. \u00a0\u201cThank god I paid for unlimited messages...\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I say?! \u00a0\u2018Oh hey Midoriya, it\u2019s Todoroki. \u00a0I know I just accidentally admitted that I\u2019m in love with you, but have you done the homework for Monday?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIs an unfortunate Freudian slip really the manner in which you want to reveal your feelings?\u201d \u00a0Tokoyami raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d \u00a0Todoroki scrambled to find the words. \u00a0\u201cMidoriya - he deserves the world. \u00a0Or at least a goddamn bouquet. \u00a0Anything but this.\u201d\n\u201cThen brush this off as an accident - as it genuinely was - move on, and focus on crafting a confession you deem worthy of Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my closet offer still stands, by the way,\u201d \u00a0Ashido added, effectively squelching the composure Todoroki had gained from Tokoyami\u2019s words. \u00a0\nDrawing a deep breath, he unlocked his phone. \u00a0There was no need in prolonging the inevitable. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt;&lt; \u00a0 I\u2019m sorry for not replying until now \n\n &lt;&lt;&lt; \u00a0I didn\u2019t intend to say... what I said \n\n\n &lt;&lt;&lt; \u00a0like you guessed, it was an accident, and quite an embarrassing one \n\n\n &lt;&lt;&lt; \u00a0I apologize for any confusion.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoddamn, Todoroki, you\u2019re texting a friend, not drafting a business email.\u201d\nTodoroki ignored Ashido and opened Midoriya\u2019s near-instant reply.\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0 oh haha thats what i thought! \n\n &gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0dont worry about it dude, no big deal :D \n\n\u00a0\nTodoroki shoved his phone back into his pocket, and began making his unsteady way back towards campus. \u00a0\nUraraka\u2019s phone buzzed the entire way. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwenty minutes later, Todoroki sped through his long-awaited shower, that disastrous \u201clove you\u201d\u00a0 looping endlessly through his mind. \u00a0He shampooed with much more vigor than necessary.\nTwenty five minutes later, Todoroki received a text from Uraraka.\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \u00a0 your ass is lucky that i also upgraded to unlimited minutes \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThirty minutes later, Kouda was surprised to discover the men\u2019s bathing facility practically dripping with steam, and a thick slush of ice coating the bottom of one of the showers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to stop thinking about the phone call.\nSo not easy, in fact, that after his body more or less shutting down in what Todoroki retroactively dubbed a \u2018panic-nap\u2019, he spent the better part of an hour wallowing in a pool of self-reproach.\u00a0 His dorm alternated between a freezer and sauna as he laid with his face buried in his pillow.\n\u201cOh my  god  ,\u201d \u00a0he groaned for the eighteenth time. \u00a0His pillow offered no response but to slightly dampen from saliva. \u00a0A pillow not entirely already un-moist, by the way, largely thanks to the panic-nap. \u00a0I'm so disgusting. \u00a0 \nTodoroki executed a perfect swan dive even deeper into self-reproach.\nBut as inviting as the water may be, and no matter how much Todoroki may have wanted to swan dive off a more lofty and non-metaphorical surface, he had to focus on the task at hand.\nJust what in the name of all things good and pure was happening to him?\nTodoroki glared at his ceiling harshly as he racked his brains for some explanation,  any  explanation for his extended Honesty Hour. \u00a0\nCould it really be the work of a quirk, or was it somehow physiological? \u00a0Was it possible he\u2019d actually gotten a concussion when Midoriya hit him, and his psyche had brought on some weird self-afflicted psychosomatic condition? \u00a0That was  really  far fetched.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nA quirk, then? \u00a0Much more probable, Todoroki thought. \u00a0Again, questions definitely seemed involved, but the damage extended beyond just queries. \u00a0Not quite like Shinsou\u2019s quirk at all. \u00a0And how the hell had he ended up under the influence of such a quirk? \u00a0Todoroki balled fists into the hem of his tank top in frustration. \u00a0\n Come on, Shouto, think!  \u00a0Todoroki screwed his eyes shut in concentration. \u00a0Maybe he should retrace his steps for the day?\nAlright. \u00a0So, he had left campus around 8:00 to head to the hospital. \u00a0Nothing abnormal there.\nNext, he had splurged on fried rice from a street vendor across from the hospital. \u00a0Todoroki frowned. \u00a0Could that be it, some weird contamination in the food, or the ill will of the vendor? \u00a0That didn\u2019t seem very likely. \u00a0Ah, well, he\u2019d keep going for now. \u00a0\nAfter that, the hospital. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t noticed anything odd there, either, only coming into contact with his mother and the receptionist. \u00a0\nFinally, the train ride back. \u00a0Oh yeah, that couple had been arguing. \u00a0What had the woman said..?\nA knock shattered Todoroki\u2019s concentration, and he groaned inwardly. \u00a0\u201cWho is it?\u201d he called, trying his best to keep the edge of irritation from his voice. \u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya!\u201d \u00a0the muffled voice replied. \u00a0\u201cI, um, wanted to check and see how you\u2019re doing!\u201d\nPanic struck a chord in Todoroki.\n \u201cLove you.\u201d  \u00a0The phone slipping from his hand. \u00a0Dark Shadow wincing. \u00a0Uraraka\u2019s unlimited messages - oh god, the images were looping again like a goddamn clip show. \u00a0\nPanic struck a whole goddamn concerto in Todoroki. \u00a0\nA second knock - much more timid - echoed from the door. \u00a0\u201cDo you want- should I leave you alone?\u201d\nAnd fucking hell, goddammit, screw Midoriya for that tinge of hurt coloring his question, the way his concern for Todoroki was so blatant.\nThe way that Todoroki found himself calling out, \u201cNo, you shouldn't,\u201d and reaching for the door to swing it open. \u00a0\nIt was beyond a shadow of a doubt that at this point, any and all interaction with Midoriya was a definite recipe for disaster. \u00a0The clear best plan of action was to have a quick little chat with Midoriya to assure him everything was A-Ok,\u00a0peachy keen!,  and to get him to stop worrying about Todoroki. \u00a0To stop looking up at Todoroki with those huge green eyes, to stop calling Todoroki by his first name to make him feel better, to stop hugging Todoroki, the boy\u2019s warmth seeping into Todoroki\u2019s skin. \u00a0\n...Dammit. \u00a0\nNonetheless, the plan remained intact.\nResolute, Todoroki flung open the door. \u00a0Get rid of Midoriya quickly - easy.\nTodoroki was not prepared for the sight that greeted him. \u00a0\u2018Easy\u2019 began passing the baton to \u2018hard\u2019, in more ways than one. \u00a0\nThere stood Midoriya, with that gorgeous smile of his firing on all cylinders, apparently fresh from a shower - honestly, why did the Universe choose  now  of all times to grant Todoroki this gift? \u00a0He needed to focus. \u00a0\nMidoriya smelled fucking  incredible, and his dark hair clung to the back of his neck.\n\u2018Focus\u2019? \u00a0Ha, good joke, Todoroki. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice cracked slightly - was this the 'Todoroki Charm' Ashido had mentioned? \u00a0He noted that the material of Midoriya\u2019s t-shirt fell on the thin end of the spectrum, and that such criminal indecency should definitely be against dorm dress codes. \u00a0Much too distracting. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo, uh,\u201d Midoriya fiddled with the hem of his immoral shirt. \u00a0\u201cUraraka told me you got McDonald\u2019s with her and Ashido and Tokoyami. \u00a0Sounds fun.\u201d\nTodoroki opted for a mere nod, strategically avoiding speech. \u00a0The elephant in the room was stomping all over his composure as it was - no need to bring dubious vocal chords into the equation. \u00a0\nMidoriya seemed similarly accosted by the pachyderm, squirming where he stood. \u00a0\u201cIs that, were they gonna make you try a McFlurry?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cOh. \u00a0That's totally something they would do.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nSilence. \u00a0Awkwardness practically dripped from the ceiling. \u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s brows knit. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d never had fast food before! \u00a0If I had, I totally would\u2019ve taken you out.\u201d\nThe door knob squealed as Todoroki tightened his grip, and Midoriya\u2019s eyes popped. \u00a0\u201cN-not like,  take you out  take you out, you know? \u00a0Just, like, us going out to eat together! \u00a0Crap, that still sounds-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I know what you meant.\u201d\u00a0 Todoroki more than knew better. \u00a0He ushered Midoriya in - they may as well walk on the eggshells fully inside of the room.\n\u201cHaha, yeah.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya tugged at his shirt again, flashing a bit of collarbone. \u00a0Todoroki bit the inside of his cheek and looked away. \u00a0\u201cWell, uh, did you enjoy it? \u00a0The fast food, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cYes, actually. \u00a0In fact, I was enjoying myself much more than I expected until I. \u00a0I.\u201d \u00a0\nShit. \u00a0With a parting victorious trumpet, the elephant vanished, clogging the atmosphere with awkwardness in its wake. \u00a0\n\u201c...I said, the. \u00a0Thing.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki finished - completely unnecessarily, he might add, because Midoriya was already trying his damndest to bore a hole into Todoroki\u2019s floor with the strength of eyesight alone.\n\u201cAh,\u201d \u00a0he said, for absolutely no good reason at all. \u00a0Was it just Todoroki, or was his breathing disgustingly loud?\n\u201cD-don't worry about it, really!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya exclaimed suddenly, too loud, tearing his eyes from the floor. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure tons of people have done that at some point or another and, and I know it was a c-complete accident and you didn't really mean it hahah of course it was a huge accident - nothing else -, and it's really not a big deal and also you still might be a little dinged up from earlier today and oh! \u00a0That reminds me.\u201d\nHow Midoriya managed to get that out all in one breath was truly beyond Todoroki, but he found himself rather unable to ponder logistics as Midoriya grabbed Todoroki\u2019s forearm and led him to his bed, pushing down gently on Todoroki\u2019s shoulders so that he sat.\nThe atmosphere clogged further. \u00a0\n\u201cI wanna check you for concussion symptoms! \u00a0Nothing fancy, obviously, but Recovery Girl is out of town and you probably wouldn't see a nurse anyways - don't give me that look, I know what you're like - so the least I can do is make sure that I didn't screw up too bad and hurt you for real.\u201d\nA self-deprecating smile wobbled across Midoriya\u2019s face, and that was really quite unacceptable, so Todoroki forced his best attempt at an encouraging smile.\n\u201cThat's a great idea, Izuku.\u201d\nThe air must have been thick for Midoriya, too, because he coughed suddenly before clearing his throat. \u00a0\u201cI, hah, well, I guess that answers the first question. \u00a0You know who I am.\u201d\n\u201cHow could I forgot,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki murmured, because his brain apparently had checked out for shore leave this morning, and Midoriya coughed again.\n\u201cS-so the next question is, is it before or after lunch right now?\u201d\n\u201cAfter.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect. \u00a0What city are we in?\u201d\n\u201cMusutafu.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect! \u00a0Who in our class single-handedly inspired a subconscious boycott of all grape products?\u201d\n\u201cMineta.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya laughed. \u00a0\u201cHave you ever thought about going on Jeopardy?\u201d\n\u201cI don't know what that is.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't know what - nevermind, we\u2019ll tackle that later. \u00a0When is your birthday?\u201d\n\u201cJanuary 11.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya nodded, and Todoroki\u2019s chest pattered dangerously at the knowledge that Midoriya knew his birthday. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat year are you?\u201d\n\u201cThird.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh. \u00a0How many times has Kaminari managed to fail at basic laundry and shrunk his uniform?\u201d\n\u201cIf I remember correctly, seven,\u201d Todoroki responded, willfully suppressing the urge to admit that he'd done the exact same thing four times. \u00a0\n\u201cWait, how did you even know that?\u201d\n\u201cYaoyorozu complained to me because Kaminari kept asking her to create replacements.\u201d\n\u201cAhh.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya grinned. \u00a0\u201cYou know way more than I do. \u00a0Not that that's surprising. \u00a0Now, what day is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe most embarrassing day of my life.\u201d\nThe Todoroki Charm was really outdoing itself today, huh.\n\u201cOh.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s voice came out too high. \u00a0\u201cI more meant like the day of the week.\u201d\n\u201c...Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cC-correct!\u201d\nMidoriya coughed yet again. \u00a0Todoroki's chest shriveled. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWell, um, I guess that\u2019s about it for the questions.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya sat down next to Todoroki, the mattress dipping. \u00a0\u201cCan I - is it alright if I touch you?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki breathed, more reflexively than anything, the greater part of his brain struggling to keep Midoriya\u2019s question firmly within context.\nMidoriya scooted closer and brushed his fingertips against Todoroki\u2019s temples, gently - too gently. \u00a0Todoroki sucked in a breath and kept it there, balled up safely in the back of his throat.\n\u201cS-so, I\u2019m gonna go over the areas that are typically sensitive, and if the contact is ever painful, tell me when. \u00a0Sound good?\u201d \u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s breath ghosted over Todoroki\u2019s face, threatening to leave a blush in its wake. \u00a0Todoroki slid his eyes shut - his only measure of defense. \u00a0\u201cSounds great.\u201d\nSo Midoriya began his ministrations, his touch gliding over Todoroki\u2019s skin in a manner dangerously close to Caress territory. \u00a0God, another  \u201clove you\u201d  was taking a battering ram to Todoroki\u2019s carefully sealed lips.\nSunlight from the window painted the inside of Todoroi\u2019s eyelids a muted red. \u00a0He breathed through his nose.\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s, huh.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya spoke suddenly, still gently rubbing at Todoroki\u2019s temples.\nTodoroki didn\u2019t have a good response, so he didn\u2019t give any.\n\u201cYou guys, uh. \u00a0It sounded like a fun group. \u00a0I mean, obviously Uraraka\u2019s great, and Tokoyami always, er, offers an interesting perspective, to say the least. \u00a0Uraraka has a theory that he owns every MCR album. \u00a0She also thinks the moon landing was faked, so I don\u2019t know how much I trust her conspiracies.\u201d\nEven with his eyes closed, Todoroki could spot the fondness in Midoriya\u2019s words. \u00a0He schooled his expression into one of complete indifference. \u00a0No traces of a certain emotion that shall not be named, no sir.\n\u201cAshido, too,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya continued, voice quieter. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s always fun.\u201d\nThe Emotion pressed against Todoroki\u2019s insides like a balloon fit to burst.\n\u201cI feel like class wouldn't be half as fun without her. \u00a0We can thank her for the whole \u2018Bakuu\u2019 thing, you know.\u201d \u00a0Gnarled hands stilled. \u00a0\u201cAnd, um. \u00a0She\u2019s really pretty too, huh?\u201d\nJealousy, goddammit - it was jealousy that nearly drew a deep wrinkle between Todoroki\u2019s brows, his eyes now more screwed shut than pleasantly lidded.\nBut no. \u00a0No. \u00a0So what, Midoriya found girls pretty? \u00a0So what, if his heart felt recently shanked? \u00a0Get over yourself, Shouto. \u00a0It's not like this was news, not by a long shot. \u00a0He had obviously read too far into Uraraka\u2019s vague comment. \u00a0Stupid; typical.\n\u201cShe is,\u201d \u00a0he answered. \u00a0While it was a subject he had never spared much thought toward, the girl really did have a nice smile, in an objective sort of way. \u00a0And Todoroki was a sucker for huge smiles. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s always very cheerful, too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya said, and speaking of \u2018cheerful\u2019, the boy sounded decidedly not so. \u00a0Midoriya began probing Todoroki\u2019s skull again. \u00a0The air between them grew stale.\nTodoroki must have screwed up somehow. \u00a0Was Midoriya somehow able to sense his jealousy? \u00a0God, leave it to Todoroki to botch a social interaction so badly.\nMidoriya paused. \u00a0\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d\nHe must have sighed. \u00a0Or grimaced. \u00a0Or both. \u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\nIn response, Midoriya kept silently stroking.\nHis breath resumed its puffing across Todoroki\u2019s cheeks, the bridge of his nose. \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s eyelids relaxed. \u00a0\nMoving further back along Todoroki\u2019s head, Midoriya gently carded bicolored bangs to the side, tugging softly at the strands of hair. \u00a0 The Caress territorial borders crumbled further.\nAnd Todoroki, Todoroki\u2019s heart jettisoned right into his throat. \u00a0\u201cWe should go to McDonald\u2019s sometime!\u201d\nAnd what the fuck, honestly, because Todoroki definitely hadn\u2019t expected his mouth to say that, nor his heart to confirm that he meant it, nor - least of all - Midoriya to burst into a peal of laughter, his breath bursting merrily across Todoroki\u2019s face. \u00a0\nIt was then that Todoroki made the fatal mistake of opening his eyes, of subjecting himself to an unobstructed, unprotected, unwarned viewing of the loveliest of smiles, Midoriya\u2019s eyes crinkling at the corners. \u00a0And fuck, his fingers were still buried in Todoroki\u2019s bangs, and his nose was lightly dusted in pink, his freckles standing out proudly, and Todoroki  really should've kept his eyes closed.\n\u201cI'd like that,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya said, lips moving hypnotically around the words, lips that were filling every inch of Todoroki\u2019s attention, lips that were quite pink and rather soft-looking. \u00a0\n\u201cOh no, did I press too hard?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s smile dropped in concern.\nChrist, Todoroki really had to work on containing his wistful sighs. \u00a0And containing himself, in general. \u00a0This situation was simply a friend looking out for another friend - probably more guilt-inspired than anything else - and nothing more. \u00a0Period. \u00a0\u201cNo. \u00a0Just fine.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case, I think you check out! \u00a0At least according to Web MD\u2019s test. \u00a0Of course, the most important information is from you. \u00a0How do  you feel - any better?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I do. \u00a0I slept for a bit, which seemed to help. \u00a0I was really freaked out during that workout, though.\u201d\n\u201cMe too! \u00a0It was really scary - I was so worried about you! \u00a0And I still feel horrible about decking you. \u00a0I\u2019m really really sorry!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya bit his lip, and Todoroki tried not to stare. \u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s good that you slept! \u00a0I, for one, love sleeping.\u201d\nSome puzzle piece clicked into place in the back of Todoroki\u2019s mind at Midoriya\u2019s statement. \u00a0Something that he  should've been thinking about this whole time, instead of constantly one-upping how much of a fool he could make of himself. \u00a0Something about loving sleep... Wait, hadn\u2019t that Mitsubishi lady said the same thing? \u00a0And then, after that...\n\u201cDamn, I really am the worst,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya lamented, eyeing Todoroki\u2019s various bruises from their spar. \u00a0\u201cYour jaw is gonna look like a grapefruit. \u00a0I don\u2019t remember leaving this one, though.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya pointed to light scratch marks decorating Todoroki\u2019s bare shoulder. \u00a0\nThat couple\u2019s argument... the pure dread on Subaru\u2019s face... the jab of Mitsubishi\u2019s nails into Todoroki\u2019s shoulder... Mitsubishi\u2019s dismay afterwards... and finally, Todoroki\u2019s inability to dodge questions or make excuses.\n\n \u201cFuck, did it activate?\u201d \n\nThe revelation sucker punched Todoroki right in the gut. \u00a0\nIt was the work of a quirk, after all! \u00a0 Mitsubishi\u2019s  quirk, to be specific\u2026 \u00a0A quirk that Todoroki had literally no information on. \u00a0The weight of Midoriya\u2019s presence struck Todoroki once more, a bowling ball of trepidation.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Todoroki whispered, with real feeling. \u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s nose scrunched in confusion, but then he just laughed. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Fuck\u2019 is right. \u00a0You\u2019ve been through a lot today. \u00a0I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re feeling better!\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki forced a weak nod, his mind racing. \u00a0How long does the quirk last? \u00a0Would Mr. Aizawa be able to erase it, or does it only work if he looks at the original quirk owner? \u00a0What kind of -\n\u201cHey, Shouto,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya said, fidgeting with his shirt further, triggering klaxons in Todoroki\u2019s turbulent thoughts.\u00a0 Distracting! \nTodoroki straightened, then downright startled as Midoriya began tracing the scratches on Todoroki\u2019s shoulder lightly, green eyes trained on the tatami mats. \u00a0\u201cI just... You know that I consider you a good friend, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki croaked, the klaxons screeching at maximum capacity as every single neuron in his brain zeroed in on the sensation of Midoriya\u2019s fingers on his skin once more. \u00a0\n\u201cWell, as my good friend, I, um,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya clasped his other hand to his chest, catching Todoroki\u2019s gaze. \u00a0\u201cI j-just really, really care about you, okay? \u00a0And seeing you in so much pain today, I- I- it was really horrible. \u00a0So if I can do anything to cheer you up, or if you ever need me for anything, please, just let me know!\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki nodded distantly, a little bit completely lost in the green of Midoriya\u2019s eyes. \u00a0\n\u201cI, um, that\u2019s all I wanted to say!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya removed his fingers from Todoroki\u2019s shoulder, leaving the skin feeling barren. \u00a0\u201cSorry for being so melodramatic.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t apologize. \u00a0It...means a lot. \u00a0Izuku.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki smiled, then wore a hint of a smirk. \u00a0\u201cBesides, we both know that Aoyama is the real drama queen of the class, not you. \u00a0So don\u2019t even try challenging his throne.\u201d\nMidoriya laughed, scratching the back of his head, his bicep flexing in a way that could only be described as  unfair.\u00a0 A droplet from his damp hair wound down the boy\u2019s neck, continuing on to his collarbone and finally disappearing under the collar of Midoriya\u2019s shirt. \u00a0Had Todoroki mentioned how this was unfair? \u00a0\nGod, he wanted to kiss that boy so bad. \u00a0But he  couldn\u2019t,\u00a0couldn\u2019t betray Midoriya like that. \u00a0Midoriya, who exemplified everything it meant to be a hero, who thought Ashido was pretty, who had just called Todoroki his \u2018good friend\u2019, for God\u2019s sake. \u00a0Todoroki  couldn\u2019t  make Midoriya uncomfortable with his own feelings, couldn\u2019t saddle Midoriya with the awkwardness and guilt that would result from him inevitably turning Todoroki down. \u00a0Todoroki  had to resist.\nBut damn, that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. \u00a0Especially when Midoriya\u2019s tan skin was so easily within reach, and when that droplet was probably still making its merry way downward, from Midoriya\u2019s chest to his stomach to his... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat was the nail in the coffin. \u00a0Todoroki felt a flush rise to his face.  Please don\u2019t let Midoriya notice.\nMidoriya noticed. \u00a0\u201cUh, Shouto, why are you glaring at me like that?\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201d \u00a0Todoroki began to lie, until a now-identified tweak of nausea hit him. \u00a0\u201cI--\u201d \u00a0Todoroki grit his teeth, and glared daggers into the wall behind Midoriya. \u00a0Could he somehow resist it? \u00a0Mind over matter, right? \u00a0\nThe inside of Todoroki\u2019s skull promptly impersonated a firecracker. \u00a0Shit.\u00a0 He had to answer Midoriya and expose himself for the creep he was, all in one fell swoop. \u00a0Todoroki grimaced. \u00a0Goodbye, friendship.\u00a0 It had been absolutely divine while it lasted. \u00a0\u201cBecause you\u2019re very attractive.\u201d\nThree seconds passed. \u00a0Then Midoriya\u2019s face flushed the brightest red Todoroki had ever seen. \u00a0\u201cI, I, I,\u201d he stammered, and Todoroki legitimately contemplated throwing himself out the window. \u00a0He could definitely survive it.\nMidoriya bit his lip again ( unfair! ), stood, and took a shaky step back towards the door, hand scrambling blindly for the handle. \u00a0\u201cT-thank you, Shouto. \u00a0That\u2019s very kind of - thank you! \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I, uh, I think I\u2019m going to leave now.\u201d\nMidoriya swung around and grabbed the door handle. \u00a0Todoroki absently noted that Midoriya\u2019s blush reached the back of his neck.\n\n I want to die.\n\nBefore he left, though, Midoriya paused, still facing the door. \u00a0\u201cJust, uh. \u00a0You should know, Shouto, that uh. \u00a0You\u2019re v-very. \u00a0Like, right now you have that huge bruise, b-but your face it\u2019s, is still very nice also. \u00a0Even with a thousand bruises you, you\u2019d still, um. \u00a0Really very nice.\u201d \u00a0His neck flared even brighter. \u00a0\u201cOh my god I can\u2019t believe I ju - goodbye.\u201d\nThe door clicked shut.\nTodoroki shut down. \u00a0\nAnd simply sat there, quite unable to even begin deciphering Midoriya\u2019s words. \u00a0If there was even anything to decipher in the first place - Midoriya tended to ramble senselessly when nervous. \u00a0\nOh god, he had made Midoriya  nervous.\u00a0 Some \u2018good friend\u2019 he was, hitting so creepily on the guy who had just sacrificed his own free time to help Todoroki that Midoriya had resorted to his go-to anxious tick. \u00a0\nWas it possible to stay curled up in the fetal position on his bed forever?\n....\nFive minutes later, no less than six exasperated texts from Uraraka blinked cheerfully across Todoroki\u2019s home screen. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy this point, Todoroki had more or less perfected what he called the \u201cshag approach\u201d - that is, forcefully sweeping all traumatic and/or paradigm-shifting events under a mental rug until an appropriate time.\nWhy shag? \u00a0Because Todorki\u2019s mental image of a rug happened to be just that. \u00a0It definitely wasn\u2019t related to a more British flavor of shag, no sir. \u00a0No matter how attractive Todoroki may find Midoriya\u2019s spoken English.\nAaand he was back to the fifth shag approach of the last couple minutes, forcing his eyes to focus on his notebook. \u00a0\nFour literal flow charts were scribbled on the paper. \u00a0After much deliberation, Todoroki had decided that his best course of option was to visit Aizawa. \u00a0It seemed unlikely that the man would be able to erase the quirk without the presence of Mitsubishi herself, but it was worth a shot. \u00a0\nMind made up, Todoroki stepped into the hallway cautiously, still wary of his stomach spontaneously cartwheeling at any moment. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know the specifics of this truth quirk by any means. \u00a0\nAs he rounded the corner of the hallway, he saw Asui heading towards the stairs, also. \u00a0Damn. \u00a0He\u2019d been hoping to avoid another McDonald\u2019s situation at all costs.\nShe paused at the door, holding it open for Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cHello, Todoroki! \u00a0Goodness, what happened to your jaw?\u201d\nHe reflexively reached up to trace it. \u00a0\u201cMidoriya and I were training this morning and he accidentally socked it a little too hard.\u201d\nAsui nodded sympathetically. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. \u00a0Are you feeling alright?\u201d\nTodoroki flinched. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m...anxious.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cAnxious?\u201d \u00a0Asui closed the door softly, effectively trapping Todoroki in the hallway. \u00a0Wonderful!  \u00a0\u201cIs there some big test coming up that I\u2019ve somehow forgotten about?\u201d\nDespite his situation, Todoroki let out an amused huff. \u00a0\u201cNo. \u00a0Or at least if there is, then I\u2019m in the same boat as you.\u201d\n\u201cA sinking boat,\u201d \u00a0Asui joked, blinking owlishly. \u00a0\u201cIf it\u2019s not school, then what has you anxious? \u00a0If you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d\nAt this point, it didn\u2019t really matter whether Todoroki minded or not. \u00a0He sighed. \u00a0He really hadn\u2019t wanted news of his dilemma to get out, especially so soon. \u00a0\u201cI think that I\u2019m under the influence of a, um, frustrating quirk.\u201d\nAsui\u2019s eyes widened. \u00a0Please don\u2019t ask what type of quirk,\u00a0Todoroki plead inwardly.\n\u201cWhat type of quirk?\u201d \u00a0Asui asked.\nTodoroki winced. \u00a0\u201cA truth telling quirk.\u201d \u00a0\nA shocked ribbit echoed in the hallway. \u00a0\u201cA truth telling quirk, Todoroki? \u00a0That really is frustrating. \u00a0How in the world did you manage to end up with that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki replied without thinking, and was surprised to discover that it apparently passed the quirk\u2019s requirements. \u00a0\n\u201cI see,\u201d \u00a0Asui nodded. \u00a0\u201cI can stop asking about it, if you\u2019d like.\u201d \u00a0\nBefore he immediately took Asui up on her offer, Todoroki forced himself to weigh his options. \u00a0At this point, if Asui had already found out the most sensitive information regarding his predicament, then it didn\u2019t necessarily make sense to push her away now. \u00a0Maybe she could become an ally in time of crisis? \u00a0Teamwork was an important skill in becoming a successful hero, after all. \u00a0\nClosing his eyes briefly, Todoroki committed to his change of plans. \u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. \u00a0Just don\u2019t tell anybody, please?\u201d\nAsui smiled warmly, her pointer finger resting on her chin. \u00a0\u201cOf course not, Todoroki. \u00a0One\u2019s privacy is a very precious thing. \u00a0So, is there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\u201cI was actually on my way to find Mr. Aizawa to see if he could somehow erase the effects. \u00a0Do you have any idea where he\u2019d be?\u201d\nAsui\u2019s smile sharpened in amusement. \u00a0\u201cMy best bet is his house, unfortunately. \u00a0Did you forget that it\u2019s the weekend, Todoroki?\u201d\nThere went his best plan of action. \u00a0Christ, he had been so preoccupied that he somehow managed to miss such a simple fact. \u00a0All those flow charts, in vain. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki answered, necessarily. \u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d \u00a0\nAsui rubbed her chin contemplatively. \u00a0\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d try to avoid people as much as possible. \u00a0We both saw how easily I was able to figure out your situation. \u00a0If you just want to hole up in your room until the quirk\u2019s effects fade, I\u2019d be happy to bring you dinner so you don\u2019t have to go to the cafeteria.\u201d\nThe taste of salted fries sprung to Todoroki\u2019s lips, and he shuddered in retrospective embarrassment. \u00a0\n An ally.\u00a0 Todoroki wanted to hug Asui, or maybe give her 5000 yen. \u00a0\u201cThat would be a  huge  help,\u201d he enthused, with genuine gratitude. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really going to owe you after this, Asui.\u201d\nAsui flapped her broad hand dismissively. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Todoroki. \u00a0I know that you would do the same for me. \u00a0I am curious, though, how exactly does this quirk of yours work?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only working on speculation at this point, but as far as I can figure, I\u2019m only compelled to tell the truth if somebody asks me a direct question. \u00a0If I try lying or simply not answering, I get a nasty headache and stomachache.\u201d\nAnother ribbit filled the hall. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s some quirk! \u00a0I suppose it could be worse, though,\u201d Asui mused. \u00a0\u201cAt least you\u2019re not walking around blabbing out whatever thought pops into your head.\u201d\nWow. \u00a0Even the thought made Todoroki queasy.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad it'll never come to that. \n\u201cYou\u2019re right. \u00a0As things stand now, though, I agree that isolation is the best form of prevention. \u00a0Thanks for the help, Asui.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Todoroki. \u00a0I\u2019ll bring dinner up around 6:30.\u201d \u00a0Asui paused on her way out of the door, catching Todoroki\u2019s eye over her shoulder. \u00a0\u201cAnd please, call me Tsuyu.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThree hours into his self-quarantine, Todoroki began to realize just how much he enjoyed meals with his classmates. \u00a0He could imagine it now: Iida tidying the napkins in the dispenser, Kaminari unironically laughing at the cow puns on the milk cartons, Mineta \u2018accidentally\u2019 spilling juice on some poor girl\u2019s blouse and offering to help her clean it up. \u00a0\nThe faux memories (excluding the last one) triggered a muted clech in Todoroki\u2019s chest. \u00a0In just a few months, he was going to graduate. \u00a0No more sticky cafeteria seats, coffee-filled smiles of camaraderie during last minute study sessions, or the same old blazer and tie every morning. \u00a0No more Midoriya...\nHow had it never occurred to Todoroki that he would soon step out this dorm room and no longer be able to call it his own? \u00a0The realization made him want to stay quarantined in this little tatami galaxy forever. \u00a0\nMidoriya had been the one to first invite Todoroki to eat lunch with his friends. \u00a0Unsurprisingly, Midoriya\u2019s usual table eventually evolved into the focal point of Class 1-A during meals, students crowding the wobbly tables excitedly and chattering through mouthfuls of udon. \u00a0Midoriya had that effect, really - a magnetic pull that tugged at anyone who ventured near the boy. \u00a0\nTodoroki had given in easily to the attraction, following the electromagnetic thrum all the way back to a rickety cafeteria seat, right next to Midoriya. \u00a0Ever since that first shared lunch, with Midoriya going out of his way to include Todoroki in the conversation, the thrum had intensified and intensified until it became a piece of Todoroki\u2019s very makeup, as steady as his heartbeat. \u00a0\nWho would act as that magnetic pole after graduation, drawing Todoroki deeper within its allure with each passing day? \u00a0Who would ask Todoroki his opinion on pro hero costumes, or persuade Todoroki into a Disney marathon to \u2018save his childhood\u2019? \u00a0Who would give Todoroki his rice pudding every lunch, just because he knew it was Todoroki\u2019s favorite?\nWho would Todoroki think about late at night, as starlight twinkled on his tatami mats?\nWell, that answer would probably remain the same long after graduation. \u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s phone buzzed, blue light glaring harshly across his face.\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya Izuku: \n\n\n &gt;&gt; r u coming to dinner soon??? \u00a0i saved ur seat :D ! \n\n\u00a0\nMidoriya must have employed the shag approach, too. \u00a0That, or he was politely letting the the two of them pretend like nothing had ever happened for the sake of preserving their friendship. \u00a0Essentially, giving Todoroki a get out of jail free card. \u00a0 How characteristically thoughtful of the boy.\nTodoroki turned off his phone and buried his face in his pillow. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe clock read 6:47 when Asui returned with dinner. \u00a0And if she noticed a slight puffiness in Todoroki\u2019s eyes, then she didn't mention it.\n\u201cI hope you like cold soba. \u00a0Midoriya said that you do.\u201d \u00a0Asui presented a covered tray. \u00a0\u201cHe also said that he hopes you feel better soon. \u00a0Bakugou then suggested you try an IcyHot Patch to \u2018dull the pain and relax it away\u2019.\u201d\nTodoroki took the tray. \u00a0\u201cDid he really say that?\u201d\nAsui nodded, with a ribbit. \u00a0\u201cIt is Bakugou, after all.\u201d\nTodoroki couldn\u2019t help it - he snorted, then laughed outright, setting the tray on his desk to avoid spilling it. \u00a0Hell, the quip wasn't even that funny, but still he laughed, purging his mind of the clinging melancholy, and Asui quickly followed suit, croaking in amusement. \u00a0His stomach tweaked again, but this time, no quirks were involved. \u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki grinned - a rare thing - knowing full well how ridiculous he looked. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, but I\u2019m going to miss having Bakugou around next year.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cMe too,\u201d \u00a0Asui\u2019s expression softened. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to miss all of the class.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s jovial mood deflated a bit. \u00a0\u201cYeah. \u00a0We\u2019ve been through a lot together.\u201d\nAsui nodded again, peering intently at Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cThis may not be my place to say, Todoroki, but I think that you should contemplate how little time we have left here, with all of our classmates.\u201d \u00a0Her gaze pinned Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that there will always be time, or another opportunity, until suddenly you find yourself face to face with a closed door.\u201d\nTodoroki frowned, lost. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d\nAsui tapped her pointer fingers together. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saying, if there was someone special to me within my grasp, I would consider making sure that my feelings reach them while they still can. \u00a0Moments, when lost, can\u2019t be found again.\u201d\nTodoroki flushed. \u00a0Not this again. \u00a0Did everyone in the whole damn class know about his feelings? \u00a0\u201cWhat in - what exactly are you talking about?\u201d\nAsui\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t falter. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you about him directly, because I really do believe in privacy, but I just felt the need to say something. \u00a0At dinner, his care for you was so clearly evident, and...\u201d \u00a0Asui paused. \u00a0\u201cI apologize, Todoroki, I\u2019m overstepping my boundaries.\u201d\nAh, damn. \u00a0An ally, huh? \n\u201cWhat makes you think that Midoriya is \u2018within my grasp\u2019?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki asked, putting himself out on a limb. \u00a0He hoped she\u2019d read between the lines.\nShe did. \u00a0\u201cI was able to accurately read your own feelings, wasn\u2019t I? \u00a0And if you\u2019re a bank vault, then Midoriya is like an open air fruit stand, emotionally. \u00a0He wears his heart so openly on his sleeve that I fear for its safety. \u00a0Midoriya so clearly wants the best for you, and would put himself in harm\u2019s way to ensure that in a heartbeat. \u00a0His feelings for you run deep.\u201d\nThe words chipped at the proverbial lock on Todoroki\u2019s heart, but failed to breach it completely. \u00a0It had had two years to strengthen itself, after all. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not so sure, Asu-- Tsuyu. \u00a0Midoriya is like that with everybody. \u00a0He\u2019s just amazing no matter the relationship. \u00a0Besides, none of those things are necessarily romantic.\u201d\n\u201cLove is more than just flowers and chocolates, Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0Asui asserted, and Todoroki short-circuited a bit at the \u2018L\u2019 word. \u00a0\u201cBut I understand what you\u2019re saying. \u00a0Unfortunately for your argument, though, I have proof for that, too.\u201d\nDespite knowing better, Todoroki\u2019s heart beat a little louder. \u00a0\u201cProof?\u201d\n\u201cProof. \u00a0Let\u2019s see, where to start?\u201d \u00a0Asui tapped her chin. \u00a0\u201cHow about the fact that Midoriya gives you his rice pudding everyday at lunch?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nThe tips of Todoroki\u2019s ears flushed, just a little. \u00a0\u201cHe simply knows that I like it. \u00a0He\u2019s a very generous guy.\u201d\n\u201cMmhhm. Speaking of things that you like, it was interesting how Midoriya knew all of your favorite foods today at dinner.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely platonic! \u00a0I\u2019m sure he knows Iida\u2019s, also. \u00a0Or even Bakugou\u2019s.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki shuddered slightly. \u00a0\nA dangerous smirk spread across Asui\u2019s face. \u00a0\u201cAlright, then. \u00a0Remember the second year winter formal? \u00a0When I went to bring Ochako some punch, I overheard him whisper to her \u2018It\u2019s so unfair, Todoroki looks even hotter in a suit. \u00a0That shouldn\u2019t be legal!\u2019. \u00a0And that\u2019s an exact quote.\u201d \u00a0Asui let out an amused ribbit. \u00a0\u201cI remember it so clearly because Ochako and I laughed about it for a good five minutes. \u00a0Supportively, of course.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s flush spread to cover the entirety of his ears. \u00a0\u201cT-that\u2019s still not--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d \u00a0Asui interrupted, clearly enjoying Todoroki\u2019s distress. \u00a0\u201cOnce, during first year, he showed me a photo on his phone of a cute frog umbrella that he saw in a shop window. \u00a0I accidentally scrolled over to the last picture, and it was a screenshot of you from the sports festival, with your shirt half burnt off. \u00a0He turned bright red and starting blabbering about how it was to \u2018study the effects of your fire\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201d \u00a0Todoroki choked, some distant part of himself wishing that  he  had a photo of Midoriya shirtless. \u00a0\u201cMaybe he  was  actually studying my quirk?\u201d \u00a0\nA deadpan stare was the only answer Asui graced Todoroki with. \u00a0The lock around Todoroki\u2019s heart rattled precariously, yet still held firm. \u00a0Reality, in all of its cruel reason, wasted no time in clipping the wings of Todoroki\u2019s flights of fancy. \u00a0\n\u201cThere, there  has  to be some other explanation,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki insisted. \u00a0The teen wasn\u2019t ignorant of his own physical...appeals, especially with the existence of the internet. \u00a0\u201cMaybe he just thinks I\u2019m handsome, but that\u2019s all. \u00a0You can easily find someone attractive but not necessarily like them!\u201d\nEven it was just the pesky influence of teenage hormones (which Todoroki was all too familiar with), the notion of Midoriya thinking that way of Todoroki did funny things to the teen\u2019s stomach. \u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stretch, Todoroki. \u00a0In my opinion, the most likely explanation is the one that you will have the hardest time accepting - and heaven knows why you're so convinced otherwise. \u00a0Midoriya almost definitely has had, and still has, romantic feelings for you.\u201d\nFirst Uraraka, now Asui. \u00a0Christ, this conversation was getting to be a little too much for Todoroki\u2019s poor heart. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s just, that  can\u2019t  be it,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki mumbled, mostly to himself. \u00a0\u201cMidoriya is so,  so...well, he\u2019s Midoriya! \u00a0There\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever think of me like that, especially when he\u2019s so much closer to - to, like, Uraraka. \u00a0Uraraka is  gorgeous , and funny, and kind, and actually adds to a conversation, unlike me.\u201d\nAsui laced her fingers together patiently, and Todoroki felt like a child throwing a tantrum. \u00a0\u201cAre you really worried about Ochako as competition? \u00a0Because I wouldn\u2019t, if I were you.\u201d\nHe groaned in frustration. \u00a0\u201cNot  Uraraka,\u00a0necessarily. \u00a0I just meant that Midoriya could do so much better than me, so there\u2019s no way he\u2019d like me as more than a friend. \u00a0Every time I've accidentally let something slip he just seemed creeped out and unsure how to let me down.\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki, I'm sure that's not the case. \u00a0This is almost certainly a classic case of misinterpretation, on both ends. \u00a0You have many admirable qualities that I'm confident Midoriya has noticed. \u00a0And you should really go search your hashtag on Twitter sometime,\u201d Asui ribbed, not unkindly, and Todoroki wondered if she and Ashido had had a little chat during dinner. \u00a0\u201cMidoriya certainly does. \u00a0I can\u2019t imagine how he handled that week when #ShoutosThroat trended.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me of that evil hashtag,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki groaned. \u00a0He really should\u2019ve known better than to eat that popsicle in public. \u00a0If nothing else, \u2018Fellate Gate\u2019 had taught Todoroki lots of...creative new slang.\nWas...was it possible Midoriya had actually looked through that hashtag? \u00a0Todoroki knew it had mostly been a big joke, but still. \u00a0According to Ashido and Kaminari\u2019s highly unnecessary commentary at the time, some of the pictures floating around had been genuinely suggestive, so the thought of Midoriya scrolling through them - perhaps late at night - and fixating on Todoroki\u2019s lips, and wondering how those lips would taste, well.\nWith the advance of Todoroki\u2019s blush to his neck, he decided that it was high time to end the conversation. \u00a0\u201cWell, Tsuyu, thank you very much for the food. \u00a0I genuinely appreciate it.\u201d\nAsui put her hands up in a placating gesture, with a ribbit. \u00a0\u201cI get it, I\u2019ll stop teasing you and leave.\u201d \u00a0Her expression turned serious. \u00a0\u201cI do mean what I said about seizing opportunities, Todoroki. \u00a0Even if Midoriya rejected your feelings - which he absolutely wouldn\u2019t - at least you wouldn\u2019t graduate and leave this place with that \u2018what if\u2019 clouding your future. \u00a0Confess to him, Todoroki, before it\u2019s too late. \u00a0Please - at least think about it. \u00a0And enjoy your soba!\u201d \u00a0\nAsui turned towards the door, bowtie hairstyle swishing with the movement. \u00a0Bits and pieces of their conversation flickered through Todoroki\u2019s head like a film reel, and he felt his chest bubble.\u00a0\nBefore he even registered his own thoughts, Todoroki called Asui\u2019s name. \u00a0She shot him a look over her shoulder, tongue lolling. \u00a0\n\u201cDid,\u201d \u00a0For fuck\u2019s sake, he was going to sound like a damn middle-schooler. \u00a0\u201cDid Midoriya really say I looked hot in a suit?\u201d\nAsui\u2019s lips quirked. \u00a0\u201cNot just \u2018hot\u2019, Todoroki. \u00a0\u2018Even hotter\u2019. \u00a0Let me know if I can help you more with that rogue quirk!\u201d \u00a0With that, Asui was gone.\nTodoroki reached for his meal and began chewing on the food robotically as his mind raced at warp speed.\nAnd speaking of \u2018even hotter\u2019, it wasn\u2019t long until Todoroki\u2019s dorm room thermostat read 87 degrees farenheit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus christ, why the fuck is it so hot up on your hall?\u201d \u00a0A voice demanded from somewhere down the hallway, outside of Todoroki\u2019s door.\u00a0 Kaminari? \u00a0 Todoroki sat up on his bed.\n\u201cIs it Todoroki\u2019s quirk?\u201d \u00a0another voice asked. \u00a0It sounded like Ojirou, this time. \u00a0\n\u201cMore than likely,\u201d \u00a0a third voice - Sero\u2019s - responded. \u00a0Typical - Todoroki had noticed the three hang out a lot. \u00a0\u201cSee Kaminari, Ojirou was able to figure it out on his own. \u00a0Why couldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I was too busy sweating my ass off!\u201d \u00a0Kaminari griped. \u00a0\u201cIs it always hotter than the ninth circle of hell up here?!\u201d\n\u201cThe ninth circle is actually ice,\u201d \u00a0Ojirou corrected. \u00a0\n\u201cBut we\u2019re very proud of you for trying that reference, anyways,\u201d \u00a0Sero added.\n\u201cFuck you guys. \u00a0Maybe if y\u2019all didn\u2019t read so much, you could actually get a date for once.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was the last time you went on a date, Kaminari?\u201d\n\u201c...Dating isn\u2019t everything, you kno-\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of ice,\u201d \u00a0Ojirou interrupted, \u00a0\u201cshouldn\u2019t Todoroki make it cold up here instead of warm?\u201d\n\u201cHe does, sometimes. \u00a0I actually sleep really well when that happens.\u201d \u00a0Sero hummed. \u00a0\u201cI think different stimuli lead to different temperature reactions.\u201d\n\u201cPlease never use \u2018stimuli\u2019 in a normal sentence again.\u201d \u00a0Ojirou sounded genuinely disgusted. \u00a0Todoroki was inclined to agree.\n\u201cSounds kinky,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari said, and Todoroki could practically hear the shit-eating grin, even through the walls. \u00a0\u201cNothing wrong with that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not too far off\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh god, you think he\u2019s been jacking it?!\u201d\nTodoroki nearly fell off his bed. \u00a0There was no reason that anything that came from Kaminari\u2019s mouth should still be able to shock Todoroki, but goddamn, it did. \u00a0It must come with the quirk.\n\u201cHe is a 17 year old dude,\u201d \u00a0Ojirou pointed out.\n\u201cHe always seems so much older, though.\u201d \u00a0Sero mused. \u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we found out that he plays golf on the weekends at his beachfront timeshare. \u00a0And calls stores to ask questions that could easily be looked up online.\u201d\nTodoroki thought that they were being a little unfair. \u00a0He happened to suck at golf.\n\u201cGoddammit, this lock is so shitty,\u201d \u00a0Sero groused, fruitless jiggling sounds revealing the source of his annoyance. \u00a0Todoroki could relate; he\u2019d frozen his own lock out of frustration more times than he\u2019d like to admit. \u00a0\n\u201cNah man, Todoroki may seem all aloof at first, but that just means you\u2019re not looking hard enough.\u201d \u00a0Kaminari declared, woefully back on subject. \u00a0\u201cLike remember that one day that Midoriya accidentally tore off his P.E. uniform during training and Todoroki set half the gym ablaze?\u201d\nOh god, did Todoroki remember. \u00a0Instead of giving him a proper lecture, Aizawa had just sighed and shook his head somberly - bloodshot eyes puffy and watery from the smoke - which was somehow worse. \u00a0\u00a0\nSero needed to hurry up with that goddamn key.\nOjirou scoffed. \u00a0\u201cWell that\u2019s because it was  Midoriya. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t count when it involves the guy he\u2019s head over heels for.\u201d\nIt was truly a miracle that Todoroki remained safely on his bed. \u00a0They know too?!  \u00a0Todoroki couldn\u2019t suppress a quiet groan. \u00a0Does the whole fucking class know? \n\u201cNo, Midoriya  definitely  counts, when it comes to Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari was definitely grinning again. \u00a0\u201cEspecially because we were just debating whether or not he polishes his icicle.\u201d\nTodoroki actively cringed as Sero and Ojirou loudly reacted in disgust. \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, if you ever say something like that again, I\u2019m going to tell Todoroki your disgusting words, and we\u2019ll see how well your little sparks hold up against his \u2018icicles\u2019,\u201d \u00a0Sero threatened.\n\u201cWait, how do we even know that he isn\u2019t in his room right now?\u201d \u00a0Ojirou sounded nervous. \u00a0\u201cHurry up with that damn lock.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, sorry,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari bulldozed on, completely ignoring Ojirou and his (highly valid) concern. \u00a0\u201cBut you guys know that I\u2019m right. \u00a0I guarantee you that if we brought Midoriya up here in some kinky bunny get-up or something, we could fry an egg on the hallway carpet.\u201d\nThe worst part - the worst part was that they weren\u2019t wrong.\n\u201cKaminari, do you want to explain why you\u2019re so fixated on the thought of Todoroki getting turned on?\u201d \u00a0Ojirou laughed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scientific! \u00a0Call it an academic quirk analysis - I\u2019m practically doing extra credit.\u201d \u00a0Kaminari paused. \u00a0\u201cAnd he\u2019s a total dime.\u201d\nOjirou and Sero snorted, and Todoroki wished that he could say that Kaminari\u2019s comment had fully restored the pride damaged by the prior conversation. \u00a0(It hadn\u2019t).\n\u201cBelieve it or not, Kaminari actually may have figured something out.\u201d \u00a0Sero continued, over Kaminari\u2019s protests. \u00a0\u201cThe few times Midoriya has visited Todoroki when I was also in my room, the floor did seem to get a bit steamier. \u00a0...And no, not like that, Kaminari.\u201d\n\u201cAwww,\u201d \u00a0Ojirou exhaled. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s actually really really sweet, Sero.\u201d\n\u201cI know, right? \u00a0Who knew that the strongest guy in class was actually a huge softie?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya does seem to have that effect on people. \u00a0Poor Todoroki never even had a chance.\u201d\n\u201cGot it!\u201d \u00a0Sero crooned triumphantly, the lock clicking open.\n\u201cWell  I  think it\u2019s fucking gay as hell.\u201d \u00a0Kaminari scoffed.\n\u201cUm, Kaminari, aren\u2019t you bi?\u201d \u00a0The door to Sero\u2019s room creaked open.\n\u201cYeah. \u00a0What\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201c...Nevermind.\u201d \u00a0The door slammed shut, sealing the voices away.\nTodoroki collapsed spread-eagle on his bed, not quite absorbing what had just happened. \u00a0This - on top of Kirishima, Asui, those godforsaken Golden Arches - was more than enough \u2018stimulation\u2019 (as Sero would say) for one day.\nUnbidden, Todoroki\u2019s mind leapt to Kaminari\u2019s words, to the mental image of Midoriya in \u2018some kinky bunny get-up\u2019. \u00a0\nWhen his blush spread all the way to his neck, he activated his ice side. \u00a0He didn\u2019t need those three jokers next door getting any more (disturbingly accurate) ideas. \u00a0\n...The rabbit ears would look so cute, nestled in fluffy green curls....\nDamn. \u00a0\u2018Fucking gay as hell\u2019 wasn\u2019t too far off.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Fire alarms screeching, an exhausted sigh, charred remains of clothing as icicles drip steadily from the ceiling. \u00a0An egg sizzles on the hallway floor - sunny side up - and hysterical laughter carries through the smoke as the screeching intensifies and- \n\nA timid knock interrupted Todoroki\u2019s nightmare, and relief came so blessedly that he could kiss his savior. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d been sleeping - stress must have oh-so-graciously taken over his body again. \u00a0\nWhen Todoroki cautiously opened the door, a cup of rice pudding was shoved into his face, and his prior resolution reaffirmed itself tenfold. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cY-You never got yours at lunch today, and you didn\u2019t show up to dinner or reply to my texts, so I thought I\u2019d bring it to you myself,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya explained hurriedly, the cup wobbling slightly.\nSo they still weren\u2019t going to talk about it, huh? \u00a0Todoroki supposed he couldn't complain, not really. \u00a0Not when every conversation was a minefield, or when every little thing he let slip from his lips ended up driving more awkwardness between the two of them. \u00a0And yet...\nTodoroki took the cup. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cI, um, missed you at dinner. \u00a0Kaminari\u2019s horrible new pickup line wasn\u2019t as funny without your appalled reaction. \u00a0The outrage really boosts the humor.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki said distantly, inwardly scrutinizing Midoriya. \u00a0Yet\u2026 Asui\u2019s \u2018proof\u2019 looped in his mind. \u00a0Was it possible that the boy really...liked him? \u00a0Could Midoriya conceivably get nervous around him, like Todoroki was now? \u00a0\nOr could Todoroki be completely reading too far into Midoriya\u2019s nervous personality, wishing so desperately for signs that he conjured them out of thin air? \u00a0Signs, however, flashing with neon fervor, at least according to Asui and Uraraka.\n\n \u2018Midoriya almost definitely has romantic feelings for you.\u2019 \n\nAhem.\nDesperate to maintain his composure, Todoroki focused on cooling his room temperature dessert.\n\u201cDid you just self-refrigerate the pudding?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s mind was racing. \u00a0 \u2018Romantic feelings\u2019, huh. \nMaybe, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to test the waters, so to speak. \u00a0Definitely nothing Kaminari-esque, like those horrible pickup lines Midoriya had mentioned, but something subtle. \u00a0If there was ever a time where words flowed easily, it was now. \u00a0\nMidoriya glanced at his hands. \u00a0\u201cAh, your quirk really is amazing. \u00a0I wish mine had more practical applications. \u00a0I guess I could help with demolition or something.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s more Bakugou\u2019s specialty. \u00a0Maybe you could help people move really heavy furniture,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki joked, then cringed inwardly at his own miserable attempt at flirting. \u00a0\nThis plan had clearly been a mistake. \u00a0Todoroki could never speak to Midoriya again, and the world was crumbling.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the future I\u2019m writing 12 page essays on the dangers of vigilantism for, huh. \u00a0Good to know.\u201d\nOh, god, was Midoriya flirting back? \u00a0There was no way Todoroki\u2019s subpar banter had actually worked. \u00a0But, but, the boy was carefully avoiding eye contact, looking off to the side, and fuck, it just might have worked after all. \u00a0\nAnd just like that, the world was fixed.\n\u201cYou know what else is good to know?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki asked, allowing his lips to curl around the words amorously, emboldened.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya seemed to hold his breath. \u00a0\nAnd Todoroki\u2019s mind came up... blank. \u00a0Nothing clever, nothing coy, so instead he settled for: \u00a0\u201cThe current state of the stock market.\u201d\nLet it never be said that Todoroki Shouto didn\u2019t have a way with words.\nIf Midoriya had been holding his breath before, he now breathed easier than a cotton undershirt. \u00a0\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\nThe atmosphere between them was static, and Todoroki felt like banging his head into the door. \u00a0A blessing in disguise really, that failure - flirting while under a respective truth serum hardly ranked in Todoroki\u2019s top ten best ideas. \u00a0Something about this quirk just made squelching his impulses ever more difficult than usual. \u00a0So instead, he settled for returning his attention to safety of the pudding, absently licking some of the desert from the back of the lid. \u00a0\n\u201cD-do you like it?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya squeaked, eyes trained on Todoroki\u2019s mouth and looking curiously tense. \u00a0Shit, I must be grossing him out. \u00a0Todoroki quickly crushed the foil into a makeshift spoon.\nTodoroki almost sassed Midoriya with  \u2018no, I just eat yours every day because I hate it\u2019,\u00a0but the truth quirk (another incognito blessing), limited him to a safely platonic \u201cI do like it.\u201d \u00a0\nMidoriya nodded in satisfaction, but made no move to exit. \u00a0The atmosphere had regained its typical energy (at least on Todoroki\u2019s end), yet he found himself at a loss on how to proceed.\n\u201cEr, is there anything else you need?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki licked another stray dollop of pudding from the corner of his mouth. \u00a0\nIt took a couple moments for Midoriya to reply, snapping to attention with a slight flush. \u00a0\u201cOh! \u00a0Yes, actually. \u00a0I know you aren\u2019t feeling so great, but some of us were planning to continue our FMA binge, and I thought it might be a good way to keep your mind off things and cheer you up!\u201d\nTodoroki blanched. \u00a0A few weeks ago, after genuine distress at the knowledge that Todoroki had never heard of some anime called \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist\u2019, Midoriya had determined that Todoroki must watch all 64 episodes with him. \u00a0Somehow, the news spread, and multiple students had begun joining in on \u2018FMA Saturday\u2019. \u00a0\nNeedless to say, a room full of people was the last thing Todoroki needed. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good idea....Izuku,\u201d \u00a0he appended, hoping the gesture of closeness would convince Midoriya to let him stay quarantined. \u00a0\n\u201cAw, come on, Shouto!\u201d \u00a0Fighting fire with fire, I see. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll be good to relax after a stressful day! \u00a0Is there anything I could do to convince you?\u201d\nIt was impressive, really, how quickly Todoroki\u2019s mind plummeted into the gutter, how quickly the bunny costume made its mental encore. \u00a0The teen\u2019s face flushed.\nDamn, even Mineta would swoon at some of the images flitting around Todoroki\u2019s stupid, stupid head. \u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki croaked, fighting a daydream of aggressively making out on one of the longue sofas. \u00a0Then winced as imaginary Midoriya beat the shit out of imaginary Todoroki with his quirk and dragged him into the lounge. \u00a0Held his sister hostage at gunpoint, threatened to kiss Bakugou right in front of Todoroki. \u00a0\nThe parameters presented by \u2018anything\u2019 were hardly exclusive.\n\u201cGood!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya beamed. \u00a0\u201cThen lemme know, so we can go watch Hawkeye be badass.\u201d\n\u201cI, um. \u00a0Just ask nicely,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki supplied lamely, inching his way into red alert. \u00a0This was not good. \u00a0Really  not good. \u00a0His stupid hormonal ass had just bought himself a one way ticket to the lion\u2019s den. \u00a0There was no way Todoroki could make it out of FMA Saturday unscathed. \u00a0\n\u201cAlrighty, then - Shouto, would you  please  grant me the honor of accompanying me to the lounge?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya dropped into a facetious bow.\n\u201cYes,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki muttered, defeated. \u00a0He was beginning to really hate that word. \u00a0\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya gave a thumbs up. \u00a0\u201cThis will definitely take your mind off of things, Shouto. \u00a0Yaoyorozu is making popcorn!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki kept his face carefully blank as Midoriya led him to the lounge, inward dread growing with each step. \u00a0Maybe nobody showed up tonight? \nEleven people had showed up that night. \u00a0Ashido, Uraraka, Asui, Yaoyorozu, Jirou, Kaminari, Hagakura, Aoyama, Iida, Kirishima, and Bakugou were all strewn about the sofas, chatting amicably (excluding the latter). \u00a0The show was already queued up, and Yaoyorozu had indeed followed up on her promise of popcorn. \u00a0At least Todoroki would have something to snack on as his life inevitably fell apart in front of his helpless eyes.\n\u201cHey, Todoroki!\u201d \u00a0Uraraka waved cheerfully, prompting a chorus of greetings (excluding Bakugou, yet again). \u00a0At least he\u2019s consistent. \n\u201cTodoroki!\u201d \u00a0Iida exclaimed, arm telescoping to point at the bruise adorning Todoroki\u2019s jaw. \u00a0\u201cWhat happened to your jaw?\u201d\n\u201cYeah dude, yikes.\u201d \u00a0Jirou winced. \u00a0\u201cThat sucker is as purple as Mineta\u2019s balls.\u201d\n\u201cMon dieu!\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya got in a solid punch during training this morning,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki explained unwillingly, absolutely refusing to touch the Mineta comment and feeling like the king of assholes when he saw Midoriya cringe next to him. \u00a0The guy obviously already felt way too guilty about it.  \u00a0Fuck this quirk. \nYaoyorozi hummed, munching on popcorn. \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t you just ice it with your quirk?\u201d\n\u201cI...yes, actually,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki admitted, a little abashed. \u00a0He really did have a lot on his mind if he had forgotten something so simple. \u00a0\nYaoyorozu smiled sympathetically. \u00a0\u201cHave some popcorn.\u201d\nIt was salty.\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d \u00a0Asui whispered fervently, sidling up next to him when he found a seat on the sofa. \u00a0Midoriya sat down on his other side.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t make up any excuses because of the quirk,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki mumbled, into her ear. \u00a0Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Midoriya glance at them with an expression that he couldn't quite decipher.\n\u201cI see,\u201d \u00a0Asui nodded. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s hope for the best. \u00a0Apparently a really good episode is coming up, so maybe people won\u2019t be very talkative.\u201d\nWith the start of a J-Pop intro, the room quieted down.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Todoroki finished his handful of popcorn, he sucked the grease off of his fingers methodically. \u00a0He hated the feeling of grubby hands. \u00a0That was more Mineta\u2019s thing.\nTo his right, Midoriya choked, and whipped his head around to stare at the TV when Todoroki turned to ask if he was alright.\n\u201cKernel went down the wrong pipe,\u201d \u00a0the boy explained, still avoiding eye contact.\nThe fluffy green tips of the boy\u2019s hair caught an ethereal glow in the blue light cast by the television. \u00a0Vaguely, Todoroki could catch the fruity scent of Midoriya\u2019s shampoo. \u00a0Their thighs were pressed together snuggly.\nSomething threatened to burst in Todoroki\u2019s chest, so he followed Midoriya\u2019s lead and turned back to the show.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRed light bathed the lounge as the Fire Alchemist unleashed his power onscreen.\n\u201cWoah, Todoroki,\u201d Jirou grinned. \u00a0\u201cYou never told me you were in Fullmetal Alchemist!\u201d\nThe students all giggled, except for Bakugou, whose head snapped up angrily.\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean, fucking \u2018Todoroki\u2019?! \u00a0I\u2019m  the one with the explosion powers, not that pretty boy Candy Cane asshole!\u201d\n\u201cAww, Todoroki, Bakugou thinks you\u2019re pretty!\u201d \u00a0Uraraka cooed.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fucking mean it like that, he looks like Elmo fucked a Yeti and had a secret love chi-\u201d\nAnother fiery explosion lit the screen.\nKaminari whistled. \u00a0\u201cDamn, Todoroki, you\u2019ve really got some power!\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up, you Energizer Bunny piece of shit!!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThree episodes in, Todoroki\u2019s eyes were glued to the screen, and Midoriya, in turn, glued himself to Todoroki\u2019s side, eyes suspiciously damp.\nBecause there, on screen, stood Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, gun locked and loaded as she stared down the enemy.\n\u201cHold me, Bakugou,\u201d \u00a0Kirishima mumbled. \u00a0Bakugou didn\u2019t even protest.\nGunshots echoed from the television. \u00a0Across the room, Aoyama blew his nose loudly into his seventh tissue. \u00a0Midoriya squeezed Todoroki\u2019s arm tighter. \u00a0\n\u201cHoly  fuck,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJirou crossed herself solemnly as Lust died. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe Mineta is fucking dead.\u201d\nTwelve pairs of lips shushed her in unison.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat,\u201d \u00a0Bakugou started, speaking over the ending theme, \u201cwas fucking incredible.\u201d\nFor once, Todoroki agreed.\n\u201cWell, do we want to watch another episode?\u201d \u00a0Yaoyorozu inquired, reaching for the remote.\n\u201cI vote yes,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka asserted. \u00a0\u201cWe should watch one of the happy OVAs to recover from that last episode.\u201d\nWhen nobody protested, Yaoyorozu busied herself setting up the DVD, and Todoroki\u2019s attention slowly drifted back down to reality. \u00a0\nMidoriya nudged Todoroki\u2019s ribs, looking smug. \u00a0\u201cI told you it was a good show, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki turned to say, but the statement came out a tad breathy when he realized just how close Midoriya was. \u00a0The boy was still latched onto his arm, presumably forgetting to remove himself after the intensity of the episode, and Todoroki found that he could count every one of Midoriya\u2019s freckles. \u00a0\nHe proceeded to do so.\n\u201cHonestly, you kinda owe me for introducing it to you,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya teased. \u00a0There it was again, the almost-flirting. \u00a0Could it somehow be flirting?!\nMidoriya popped a kernel into his mouth, licking the salt from his lips absently, effectively jamming all of Todoroki\u2019s powers of cognition. \u00a0So before he could even think about what he was saying.\n\u201cSeems fair to me,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s heart pounded furiously. \u00a0He allowed his voice to deepen, tasting the words before he spoke. \u00a0\u201cIs there anything in particular you\u2019d like?\u201d\nMidoriya flushed, the red in his cheeks contrasting against his freckles in a way that was really quite lovely. \u00a0\u201cY-you, are you--\u201d\nA loud burst of music jolted the room, and Yaoyorozu grinned sheepishly as she grabbed the remote and lowered the volume. \u00a0\u201cSorry about that, guys!\u201d\nChrist, alright, how had Todoroki somehow forgotten that he and Midoriya were in a room surrounded by eleven other people? \u00a0He quickly tore his eyes from Midoriya and focused pointedly on the screen, just barely suppressing a blush with all of his willpower. \u00a0\nThe couch shifted as Todoroki felt Midoriya put some distance between their bodies. \u00a0Todoroki already missed the warmth. \u00a0\nAsui nudged him. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Completely platonic\u2019, you said?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d \u00a0he hissed, finally losing the battle of wills as his face flooded with heat. \u00a0Then: \u00a0\u201cAnd yes, I did say that.\u201d \u00a0 Goddamn stupid quirk. \n\u201cI\u2019m quite excited to see this OVA,\u201d \u00a0Iida was declaring. \u00a0\u201cIzumi Curtis is certainly an intriguing character, and I look forward to learning more about her.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely one of my favorites,\u201d \u00a0Uraraka agreed. \u00a0\n\u201cI like the characters from Xing,\u201d \u00a0Asui added, tongue hanging lazily. \u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, finally,\u201d \u00a0Ashido blurted. \u00a0\u201cWe all need to take a moment to appreciate how hot Ling is. \u00a0He definitely needs more screen time. \u00a0I mean, the Elrics are cool and all, but at least give the side characters a chance! \u00a0And the foreign ones are always the coolest. \u00a0Also, Ling\u2019s ponytail totally kicks Ed\u2019s ponytail\u2019s ass.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk that way about the Elrics,\u201d \u00a0Ochako hissed, voice strangely menacing. \u00a0\u201cThey have the greatest television brotherhood of all time, and I absolutely will not tolerate any bad-mouthing.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, Ed\u2019s hair is iconic,\u201d \u00a0Kaminari added. \u00a0\u201cIt just goes to show that blonde hair is the sexiest.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more!\u201d \u00a0Aoyama tossed his own locks in an clearly-practised movement. \u00a0\nA headphone jack smacked Kaminari, courtesy of Jirou. \u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that, Kaminari. \u00a0After all, our very own Bakugou is blonde.\u201d\nSaid blonde erupted. \u00a0U.A. had really done right by investing in flame retardant furniture. \u00a0\u201cJust what are you implying, Headphone Jackass?!\u201d\n\u201c-I like Scar!\u201d \u00a0Kirishima interrupted strategically. \u00a0\u201cHis motivations are very manly.\u201d\n\u201cIs nobody going to bring up Winry?\u201d \u00a0Yaoyorozu looked slightly offended. \u00a0\u201cI find her mechanical skills very inspiring.\u201d\n\u201cA lovely maiden, with eyes that sparkle comme la salet\u00e9~\u201d \u00a0Aoyama sighed wistfully. \u00a0\n\u201cYet another blonde\u2026\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cJust give it up, Kaminari.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, Todoroki?\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki startled slightly. \u00a0He\u2019d been mostly tuning out the conversation, but Midoriya\u2019s voice cut right to the center of his attention. \u00a0Old habits died hard, and whatnot. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat about what?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki countered precariously, silently begging every god out there for a benign question. \u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite character?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya repeated, and Todoroki sighed inwardly in relief. \u00a0This was workable -\n\u201cNah, not \u2018favorite\u2019. \u00a0That topic is already stale.\u201d \u00a0Hagakure giggled. \u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s your pick for hottest character?\u201d\nAh, not quite as tame, but still harmless. \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s mind jumped to the Fire Alchemist. \u00a0He had always had a thing for guys with messy hair. \u00a0\n\u201cRoy Mustang,\u201d Todoroki answered, letting the truth slip easily from his lips, for once. \u00a0\nThose present began voicing either their consent or disagreement. \u00a0\u201cOf course Todoroki would choose the fire dude.\u201d \u00a0\u201cRoy is so uptight though!\u201d \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t try and tell me that a man in uniform isn\u2019t hot.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe uptight ones are always the best in bed though...\u201d \u00a0\u201cMina!!\u201d\nFrom his perch on the arm of the sofa, Bakugou scoffed, apparently still a little testy from Jirou\u2019s jab. \u00a0\u201cReally, Todoroki? \u00a0Colonel Mustang? \u00a0What are you, gay?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki replied automatically.\nAnd promptly froze, the entire room quickly following suit. \u00a0\n\u201cFullmetal Alchemist,\u201d the TV declared triumphantly. \u00a0Kaminari coughed. \u00a0Nobody else moved a muscle. \u00a0This was hell.\n\u201cFullmetal Alchemist!\u201d the TV repeated, the narrator laughing slightly. \u00a0How fitting. \u00a0Asui silently gave his leg a comforting pat.\n Fuck.\u00a0 Honestly, Todoroki genuinely didn\u2019t mind his class knowing his sexuality. \u00a0He had never avoided revealing it, per se - he more had always just assumed that they would figure it out on their own at some point or something. \u00a0But  this,\u00a0with 12 pairs of eyes trained solely on him,  this  was distressing. \u00a0\nThe window was looking ridiculously enticing right about now. \u00a0If he escaped, he could surely get a job and change his name, then-\nIncredibly, it was Bakugou who broke the silence. \u00a0\u201cSo Icy Hot is gay - big deal. \u00a0Doesn\u2019t make him any less of a fuckwad.\u201d\nTodoroki had never been happier to be called a fuckwad. \u00a0Fitting for his quirk, Bakugou\u2019s comment effectively broke the ice, and the room suddenly became much, much too loud. \u00a0\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not a \u2018big deal\u2019!\u201d \u00a0Iida exclaimed earnestly, hands swiveling to point at Todoroki. \u00a0\n\u201cWait, you mean you didn\u2019t already know?\u201d \u00a0Kaminari snorted. \u00a0\u201cPlease - Todoroki basically left rainbow trails wherever he walked, like some sort of gay snail.\u201d\nWith that flattering comparison, Kaminari ruffled Todoroki\u2019s hair in a \u2018show of gay/bi solidarity\u2019, his electricity rendering Todoroki\u2019s hair reminiscent of a Furby. \u00a0Ashido declared yet another moment of silence for the fangirls. \u00a0She seemed to be fond of that joke. \u00a0\nWell, Todoroki supposed it could have gone worse. \u00a0Coming out, that is. \u00a0Not that he had ever really planned to, though. \u00a0Todoroki fancied himself a pretty private guy, so any kind of public sharing like this wasn\u2019t really his style. \u00a0\n\u201cDespite his less than poetic analogy, I agree with Kaminari,\u201d \u00a0Yaoyorozu mused. \u00a0\u201cTo be honest, I just assumed that you were keeping it private on purpose. \u00a0If you don\u2019t mind me asking, Todoroki, how come you never said anything?\u201d\nTodoroki shrugged. \u00a0\u201cIt never came up.\u201d \u00a0The room blinked simultaneously.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t - ah, nevermind.\u201d \u00a0Yaoyorozu sighed. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just happy that you felt comfortable telling us all!\u201d\n\u201cThis is awesome,\u201d Kirishima exclaimed. \u00a0\u201cNow I can finally be your wingman! \u00a0Not to brag, but I\u2019ve literally never failed in sparking the sweet, sweet flame of romance at a friend\u2019s behest.\u201d\nJirou smirked. \u00a0\u201cI doubt Todoroki needs a wingman, especially  you,\u00a0Nokia Boy. \u00a0Have you ever seen the things people tweet about him? \u00a0Have you somehow forgotten Fellate Gate? \u00a0You\u2019d probably hurt his chances, if anything.\u201d\nKirishima gasped indignantly. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m about to hurt more than just Todoroki\u2019s chances.\u201d\nA pillow flew across the room and smacked Kirishima in the face. \u00a0\u201cOh, it\u2019s  on,\u201d\u00a0Jirou challenged, brandishing another pillow in her left hand.\n\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s not resort to violence,\u201d \u00a0Aoyama said nervously. \u00a0\u201cFighting between friends is unseemly, oui?\u201d\nWith the whack of another pillow across Aoyama\u2019s meticulously swept locks, all talk of peace swiftly became obsolete. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make you pay for that, mon cheri. \u00a0This lovely coiffure does not style itself.\u201d\nWith the room firmly settled back into comfortable chaos, Todoroki found the smallest of smiles gracing his lips as he leaned back into the couch to avoid the line of pillow fire. \u00a0Asui looked confused (\u201cHow were there people that didn\u2019t already know?\u201d), but then patted his leg one last time. \u00a0He was going to miss moments like these, when he graduated. \u00a0\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw Bakugou peering at him. \u00a0Todoroki returned the look for a few seconds, and something seemed to pass between them, until Bakugou rolled his eyes and went to aid Kirishima in his battle against Jirou and Aoyama.\nTodoroki then noticed the weight missing to the right of him. \u00a0Midoriya was gone; he hadn\u2019t said so much as a word about Todoroki\u2019s unintentional confession. \u00a0Could it be that Midoriya had a problem...?\nNo way. \u00a0Todoroki shook his head, clearing the ridiculous thoughts. \u00a0This was Midoriya he was talking about. \u00a0That guy was as far from intolerant as they come. \u00a0And apparently...found Todoroki attractive. \u00a0Todoroki coughed. \u00a0 Then where the hell did he go? \nOh. \u00a0Midoriya was currently huddled halfway down the hallway with Uraraka, their conversation inaudible from Todoroki\u2019s position. \u00a0He appeared to be whispering frantically, his arms gesticulating as he spoke. \u00a0Uraraka laughed and put a hand on her hip, smirking through her reply. \u00a0\nTodoroki really wished he could\u2019ve heard what she said, because Midoriya promptly began resembling a tomato, visibly stuttering as he shook Uraraka\u2019s shoulders. \u00a0Uraraka smiled again as she spoke, patting Midoriya\u2019s hand where it rested on one of her shoulders. \u00a0Midoriya returned the favor, albeit his smile a bit more wobbly, and he gave Uraraka a quick hug.\nWhy hadn\u2019t lip reading been part of hero training?? \u00a0Even though he knew it was childish, Todoroki felt jealousy simmering in the pit of his gut. \u00a0He envied that closeness with Midoriya,  craved it.  \u00a0  He  wanted to be the one whispering with Midoriya in the corner, heads bowed together as their breaths intermingled with laughter. \u00a0\nMidoriya looked up and caught Todoroki staring, quickly repeating his imitation of a tomato. \u00a0Out of the corner of his eye, Todoroki saw Uraraka smirk again and lightly shove Midoriya in his direction. \u00a0\n\u201cSooo, Todoroki,\u201d \u00a0Jirou flopped into the Midoriya\u2019s old space, bits of down feathers stuck in her hair. \u00a0\u201cAs a fellow rainbow-trailing snail, I\u2019d like to welcome you to the club with some friendly, motherly advice.\u201d \u00a0She paused dramatically. \u00a0\u201cNever forget to use lube.\u201d\nTodoroki choked on his own spit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFive more wildly inappropriate comments from Jirou and six more disturbingly apt snail comparisons from Kaminari, Todoroki decided it was high time to call it a night.\nHe really should've known better than to think he'd be able to retreat safely.\n\u201cShouto, wait!\u201d\nMidoriya caught Todoroki in the stairwell, just past the landing between the fourth and fifth floor. \u00a0The stairwell really hadn\u2019t been kind to Todoroki, today.\nHe bypassed Todoroki to stop one step beyond him, effectively blocking any exit. \u00a0\u201cI, I need to talk to you,\u201d \u00a0the boy blurted, shoulders tensed. \u00a0\nTodoroki crossed his arms and leaned against the wall. The handrail dug into his abdomen. \u00a0\u201cThen let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\u201cW-well, I just. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but I kind of bailed on you right after your uh, announcement, and I didn\u2019t want you getting the wrong idea.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya bounced on his toes, hair wobbling with the movement. \u00a0\u201cFor the record, I was really happy to hear it.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s heart leapt into his throat.  Happy? \n\u201cCrap, that came out weird,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya rushed, turning red. \u00a0\u201cI just meant that I was happy for  you,\u00a0yeah.\u201d \u00a0He paused. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know if you meant to come out quite like that, but I bet it\u2019s nice to have it out in the open.\u201d\n Oh. \u00a0The handrail dug even deeper into Todoroki\u2019s side, and he shrugged. \u00a0\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly  avoiding  telling people. \u00a0I suppose it just never came up directly.\u201d\n\u201cGotcha. \u00a0Dang, I wish I ha-- I bet a lot of people will be very interested to hear the news. \u00a0Ashido was right about all your fangirls.\u201d\nTodoroki let out a  pffft. \u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to assume that Ashido was being Ashido and exaggerating.\u201d\nMidoriya looked genuinely stunned. \u00a0\u201cI- Shouto, have you ever actually looked through Twitter? \u00a0Or, I don\u2019t know, at a mirror?\u201d\nIt was Todoroki\u2019s turn to sputter. \u00a0\u201cNo, not really? \u00a0Twitter, I mean. \u00a0I look at mirrors often. \u00a0My bathroom has one.\u201d \u00a0The Todoroki Charm was really firing on all cylinders, huh. \u00a0\u00a0\nMidoriya gaped again, and whipped out his phone, jabbing at the blue bird icon. \u00a0It didn\u2019t even take 15 seconds for his expression to morph from determined to very, very flustered.\n\u201cS-see!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya shoved the phone into Todoroki\u2019s hands. \u00a0\u201cLook at what they say about you! \u00a0And that was literally the second tweet under your hashtag.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s brow furrowed as he squinted at the screen. \u00a0The first tweet linked a photo of him collapsing a crumbling building with his ice in order to detain a criminal.\n\u00a0\n&gt;  @im_a_little_tea_thot \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   #shoutotodoroki out here destroying walls and\u00a0   all I wanna know is When will he destroy MY walls???? \n\u00a0\n...Oh. \u00a0\u201cAt least they\u2019re being forthright with their feelings.\u201d\nMidoriya groaned in despair. \u00a0\u201cJust keep scrolling.\u201d\n\u00a0\n&gt;  @whatgoesup_mustcumdown \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   real talk here, id fuck #shoutotodoroki\u00a0   harder than the japanese school system fucks students\u2019 mental health \n\u00a0\n&gt;  @nipl \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Discussion topic: does #shoutotodoroki have pubes like a\u00a0   sideways flag of Indonesia? \u00a0#dothecurtainsmatchthedrapes ?? \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ^^^ @[thx_4_the_memeories] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@nipl \u00a0if i ever got close enough to find\u00a0out, my mind (and mouth) would be on a different type of pole than a flag pole. \n\u00a0\nTodoroki coughed. \u00a0\u201c Very  forthright.\u201d\nAnother photo link led to a picture of Todoroki in his hero outfit, his bangs slightly tousled as he stared somewhere off camera.\n\u00a0\n&gt;  @fuck_a_duck \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   #shoutotodoroki   \u00a0   jfc have u ever seen a more beautiful\u00a0   boy??1? \u00a0im,,,,, \n\u00a0\nTodoroki paused in his scrolling. \u00a0\u201cWait, Izuku, why does this one have a red heart?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya yelped, snatching back the phone and stuffing it back into his pocket. \u00a0\u201cYou, I bet you hit \u2018like\u2019 by accident, yeah. \u00a0That happens all the time. \u00a0It\u2019s really annoying,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya laughed nervously. \u00a0\u201cB-but you get my point, right?? \u00a0And this doesn\u2019t even  touch  some of the tweets during F-Fellate Gate!\u201d \u00a0He blushed even brighter.\nHoly shit, Midoriya had looked at those tweets. \u00a0And holier shit, that knowledge was somehow...kind of hot? \u00a0\u201cYes, I understand your point. \u00a0But why exactly did you make it?\u201d\n\u201cTo prove Ashido\u2019s point! \u00a0And to show that a ton of guys are going to be absolutely thrilled when the internet inevitably finds out that you\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d \u00a0A vague, kinda-sorta turned on feeling buzzed in Todoroki\u2019s veins, clouding his judgement. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care much about the internet, though. \u00a0I\u2019m more interested in my classmates.\u201d\nThe statement hung heavily, and the air seemed to buzz in tandem with Todoroki\u2019s blood.\n\u201cI-interested?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya squeaked.\n\u201cVery.\u201d \u00a0If Todoroki\u2019s judgement had been cloudy before, it was altogether overcast now.\nMidoriya swallowed visibly, and Todoroki stared shamelessly at the boy\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. \u00a0\u201cHey, Shouto,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya began, voice all breathy. \u00a0\u201cDid you know that I also like guys?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nOh, wow. \u00a0They were, um. \u00a0Thanks to the stairs, Midoriya was perfectly at eye level, for once, and Todoroki was kinda glad that he normally wasn\u2019t, because having the boy\u2019s lips and freckles so near and accessible and goddamn alluring was bad for Todoroki\u2019s sanity.\n\u201cI had heard that,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki whispered hoarsely.\u00a0 \u2018Confess to him, Todoroki,\u2019\u00a0 the ghost of Asui egged him on.\u00a0 \u2018Before it\u2019s too late.\u2019\u00a0 \u201cI had...hoped.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes grew impossibly wide, and this close, Todoroki was struck by the profundity of their hue. \u00a0\u201cD-does that mean tha--\u201d\nThe fourth floor stairwell door flung open, the crash ringing harshly in Todoroki\u2019s ears. \u00a0Two sets of footsteps echoed, their sources hidden by the bend in the staircase.\n\u201cYou bastard, what is your fucking deal with slamming doors?! \u00a0People are gonna hear that shit.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s unmistakeable voice was the coldest of cold showers, mercilessly incinerating any butterflies in Todoroki\u2019s stomach. \u00a0\n\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d \u00a0Kirishima\u2019s voice replied, his grin audible. \u00a0\u201cI guess I\u2019ve just got \u2018slamming\u2019 on my mind. \u00a0Did I mention how much I love that tank top on you?\u201d\n\u201cSo are you saying that I should keep it on, you Chia Pet?\u201d\n\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s not jump to conclusions,\u201d \u00a0Kirishima purred, and good lord, speaking of showers, Todoroki felt a strong need for a cleansing one now. \u00a0\nGlancing over, Todoroki discovered that Midoriya seemed to feel similarly horrified, and the boy tugged on Todoroki\u2019s sleeve in a clear plea to get the fuck out of here. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll just jump you instead,\u201d \u00a0Kirishima continued, sounding satisfied by his own wordplay. \u00a0Midoriya dragged Todoroki towards the fifth floor desperately.\n\u201cThen how about you fucking get on with it and stop fucking blithering on,\u201d \u00a0Bakugou growled.\n\u201cDamn, \u2018blithering on\u2019? \u00a0Have I ever told you how much a wide vocabulary turns me on, Katsuki?\u201d\n\u201cHow fucking serendipitous for you, then.\u201d\n\u201cBabe!\u201d\nScuffs echoed up the stairwell, followed by an unmistakably wet sound and - oh god - a lewd moan that sounded suspiciously Bakugou-esque. \u00a0Todoroki could practically hear his bank account sinking into future counseling.\n\u201cOh yeah, baby, don\u2019t hold back~\u201d \u00a0\nMidoriya finally finished fumbling with the door handle, and the pair dashed to safety as if running from a homicidal villain. \u00a0The rustle of fabric hitting the floor served as a parting goodbye.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya collapsed against the hallway wall, curling up into a cocoon of despair. \u00a0\u201cKacchan...\u201d \u00a0Midoriya covered his eyes with his forearm. \u00a0\u201cKacchan is making out right now.\u201d\n\u201cOr having sex,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki supplied unhelpfully, and Midoriya groaned from under his arm. \u00a0\u201c...Sorry.\u201d\nThe boy looked dead inside. \u00a0Todoroki found himself sympathizing - it must be weird, putting it lightly, to hear your childhood bully sucking face only a few meters away from you.\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s with Kirishima,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki offered, taking a stab at cheering the boy up. \u00a0\u201cIf you ask me, he\u2019s a great influence on Bakugou. \u00a0His attitude, I mean - not in a kinky way.\u201d\nMidoriya removed his forearm from his face to fix Todoroki with a lifeless glare. \u00a0Todoroki took that as his cue to shut up\n\u201cI heard Kacchan moan.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya sunk further into himself. \u00a0\u201cOh my god. \u00a0I heard Kacchan moan!\u201d\n\u201cMore than once,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki nodded, at a complete loss. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u00a0\nWhat the hell should he do? \u00a0One moment he had been this close to kissing Midoriya, and the next, the boy was curled up like a traumatized roly poly. \u00a0As the memory looped in his head, Todoroki bristled. \u00a0\nHe should be the one making out right now, not goddamn Bakugou. \u00a0And Midoriya should be the one moaning, and shedding clothing, and looking up at Todoroki with those big green eyes as Todoroki leaned forward and kissed the shit out of that boy...\nFuck. \u00a0He suddenly needed a shower again, and for decidedly different reasons.\nMidoriya sighed and stood up listlessly. \u00a0\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can go back to my room for a bit, unless I want to have my childhood crumble before my eyes again.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically, we didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki said. \u00a0Midoriya glared again, and this time there was more bite to it. \u00a0Todoroki counted it as progress.\n\u201cGeez, somebody sure is mouthing off tonight.\u201d\nTodoroki grinned slightly, and before he could stop himself: \u00a0\u201cIs it Bakugou?\u201d\nThree seconds passed - four. \u00a0Silence. \u00a0Regret swamped Todoroki. \u00a0Had he taken the joke too far? \u00a0Midoriya had been pretty clearly upset by the incident and-\nMidoriya burst out laughing, his breaths coming out in gasps. \u00a0\u201cWhat?? \u00a0S-shouto, ahahah, that doesn\u2019t even make, hahah, sense! \u00a0Mouthing, mouthing off on what, ahah? \u00a0Kirishima??\u201d \u00a0Midoriya grabbed his stomach, throwing his head back against the wall as tears began beading in his eyes. \u00a0A snort escaped Midoriya.\nAnd heavens, did Todoroki want to kiss him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYes, probably Kirishima.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki forced his heart into a lower gear. \u00a0\u201cI, um. \u00a0You can hang out in my room until the, er, storm passes, so to speak. \u00a0If you want to avoid anything potentially scarring.\u201d\nMidoriya straightened, wiping his eyes. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that. \u00a0I think my childhood has taken enough critical hits as is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMake yourself at home,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki said, as Midoriya took him up on the offer and collapsed onto his bed. \u00a0The image did funny things to Todoroki\u2019s stomach, and he swallowed thickly. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go wash my face.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya nodded as Todoroki shut the bathroom door behind him. \u00a0\nSafely retreated, Todoroki forced himself to breathe evenly as he turned on the sink. \u00a0He dragged soapy hands down his face, rubbing his temples with more vigor than necessary.\nThis was not a good idea,\u00a0 Todoroki consulted his reflection, a bead of water running along his busted jaw. \u00a0Hell, it hadn\u2019t even been five minutes, but signs of the boy\u00a0were already surrounding Todoroki, smothering him, from the his strawberry scent to his quiet humming to the Midoriya-sized crater forming on Todoroki\u2019s bed. \u00a0\nThe door creaked open. \u00a0\u201cSorry, I think there\u2019s something in my eye.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya joined him at the sink, pulling at his bottom lid.\nTodoroki backed away, carefully, and toweled off his face.\u00a0 Composure. \u00a0Remain composed.\nMidoriya let out a small sound of triumph, blinking rapidly. \u00a0\u201cThank god.\u201d \u00a0He paused. \u00a0\u201cOh hey, this is that mirror of yours that I\u2019ve heard so much about.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya smiled. \u00a0\u201cI trust it does its job well?\u201d\n\u201cIf by \u2018well\u2019 you mean \u2018revealing my terrible bed head every morning\u2019, then yes.\u201d\n\u201cB-bed head?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya faltered, eyes unfocusing. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s, wow, um. \u00a0That\u2019s funny.\u201d\nTodoroki simply shrugged, and leaned back against the bathroom wall. \u00a0\nMidoriya blinked and straightened. \u00a0\u201cAha, just because your hair normally looks so well put-together! \u00a0Mine is hopeless. \u00a0No matter what I try, it always looks like a just woke up from one of my biweekly hospital naps.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate - you were only hospitalized once last month,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki deadpanned. \u00a0\u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t worry about your hair. \u00a0At least it isn\u2019t candy cane themed.\u201d\n\u201cBut people like candy canes! \u00a0There are much worse things than candy canes. \u00a0For example, bird\u2019s nests,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya pulled on his bangs.\n\u201cI happen to like bird\u2019s nests.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s cheeks brightened, and he promptly broke their eye contact. \u00a0Todoroki followed his gaze. \u00a0His bathroom floor grout had never enjoyed such intense scrutiny.\nSuddenly, Midoriya groaned and whipped around to face Todoroki. \u00a0\u201cI, when you say things like that, like that you \u2018like bird\u2019s nests\u2019, or that you're i-interested in your classmates-- why,\u201d \u00a0his cheeks burned brighter. \u00a0\u201cWhy do you say them?\u201d\nThat was an odd question. \u00a0Todoroki shrugged again. \u00a0\u201cBecause they\u2019re true.\u201d\nMidoriya chewed on his lip. \u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s brow knit in mild confusion. \u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d \u00a0Then, more softly. \u00a0\u201cI am always genuine when I\u2019m around you Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I - I see,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s voice, strangely, had gained a slight wobble. \u00a0His eyes darted back towards the grout. \u00a0\u201cWell, uh, I think it may be best if I leave now.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s brow furrowed deeper. \u00a0Had he fucked something up?\nUpon another glance, the line between Midoriya\u2019s brows was markedly unstable, so yes, Todoroki had fucked something up. \u00a0Typical.\nHe didn\u2019t want Midoriya to leave like this, all sad and gloomy and decidedly non-Midoriya-esque. \u00a0\n\u201cYou should stay.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s head whipped back up.\u00a0 One of these days he\u2019s gonna develop neck problems.\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBesides the fact that we want to avoid the second erosion of your \u2018childhood\u2019, I,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki took a deep breath \u00a0\u201cwant you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya breathed. \u00a0\u201cThen alright!\u201d\nAh, that was more like it, with the thousand watt smile fully operational once more. \u00a0That smile that made Todoroki do stupid, stupid things, like say:\n\u201cYou might as well just sleep over, if you want.\u201d\n1,000 watts quickly became 10,000, and Todoroki swore he could nearly taste Midoriya\u2019s excitement in the air. \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a one-on-one sleepover,\u201d \u00a0he was babbling. \u00a0\u201cI had some with Kacchan when I was a kid, but now that Kirishima ruined that period of my life forever, I need to make some new memories.\u201d\nOverwhelmed, Todoroki fell back to his customary nod. \u00a0He had made a terrible mistake, and he knew it. \u00a0A goddamn sleepover, while presumably still under the truth quirk. \u00a0Some A+ strategizing, really.\u00a0 Oh well, the only course of action now is to avoid other mistakes at all costs.\n\u201cAh, crap,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya looked down at himself. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have any clothes to sleep in.\u201d\n\u201cYou can use some of mine,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki said, making another mistake.\n\u201cAwesome, thanks!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya gave what might have been the cutest thumbs up of all time, and Todoroki realized that it was high time for a Time Out.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d he declared, firmly guiding Midoriya out of the bathroom.\n\u201cWait, but haven\u2019t you already taken one today?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0The bathroom door clicked shut. \u00a0\u201cFeel free to wear anything you can find.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe water pressure was harsh, pelting Todoroki\u2019s skull. \u00a0Good.\u00a0 Maybe the water could beat some sense into his head.\n Just like Izuku beat the shit out of my face. \u00a0Todoroki flinched as the stream hit his bruise. \u00a0Damn, that kid was strong. Todoroki sighed. So strong...\nHe didn\u2019t even bother reaching for the shampoo or conditioner, or the bunny loofah he\u2019d won during last year\u2019s Secret Santa. \u00a0Getting clean wasn\u2019t really the point, now was it?\nThe point was to...well, scheme to redact his sleepover promise, he supposed. \u00a0Or at least formulate a game plan to avoid making even more of an ass of himself while Midoriya was over.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki questioned out loud, his voice all soggy in the humidity. \u00a0It hardly helped boost his confidence as he\u2019d hoped.\nBecause a whole hell of a lot could happen, and he knew it. \u00a0An adorable, sleepy Midoriya in the same room as a scarily forthright Todoroki? \u00a0Lord have mercy. He could already imagine it: his fluffy green hair even messier than usual from his pillow, his nose scrunching up as he yawned, sleepily scratching at his stomach and flashing a hint of abs that would most definitely wreak havoc on Todoroki\u2019s circadium rhythm.\nHell, with Todoroki\u2019s luck, he could imagine himself getting up to pee in the middle of the night and tripping over Midoriya, then landing on top of him like some cheap, contrived scene from an ecchi. \u00a0Assuming Midoriya would be sleeping on the floor next to his bed, that is. And if not...\nOh  god,\u00a0if they shared his bed. \u00a0Todoroki swallowed, not even registering the water hitting his face anymore. \u00a0Those things were not wide, especially for two adolescent guys. They\u2019d practically be breathing in each other\u2019s faces.\nTodoroki squirmed underneath the water stream. \u00a0Or-or what if...Midoriya faced the other way, back towards Todoroki and arching slightly as he got comfortable. \u00a0His back arching in a way that made Midoriya\u2019s body threaten to invade Todoroki\u2019s personal space, leaving mere centimeters between Todoroki\u2019s hips and Midoroya\u2019s, Midoriya\u2019s\u2026\nWith a start, Todoroki opened his eyes, only to wince as they were hit by some spray. \u00a0\nAnd then winced again when he realized the path his right hand had drifted down. \u00a0\n(Hint: the same path as a healthy proportion of his blood.)\n\u201cNo, Shouto, not now,\u201d he whispered aloud, but yet again the words proved hardly convincing. \u00a0Not when there were images of messy green hair filling Todoroki\u2019s vision as the boy laid next to him. \u00a0Midoriya would be a very careful little spoon; if he happened to shift up against Todoroki, surely it was on accident.\n Oops, Midoriya would shoot a coy grin over his shoulder as he moved against Todoroki, ass pressing right up against Todoroki\u2019s hard dick. \u00a0Mm, maybe not accidental after all.\nThere was no point in fighting it now, right? \u00a0Todoroki wrapped his hand around his cock.\u00a0 Right.\nWith an offhand comment about his shorts being \u201cannoying\u201d, Midoriya would kick them off, leaving himself deliciously near-naked, his perky butt peeking out from underneath a too-large pajama shirt.\nAnd  oh,  what if that shirt was Todoroki\u2019s own, what if it was his own shirt that Todoroki snuck a hand under, greedy fingers reaching for a hard nipple as Midoriya\u2019s perfect, adorable ass grinded up on Todoroki, whose own cock was straining against his boxers and leaving a damp spot of pre-cum on the fabric.\nMidoriya, ever-vigilant, would pause in his grinding to shoot a sympathetic glance Todoroki\u2019s way.\u00a0 Surely that can\u2019t be comfortable\u2026 he\u2019d muse, pushing Todoroki onto his back, only to promptly straddle him. \u00a0\nKissing down Todoroki\u2019s writhing abdomen, Midoriya would stop at the elastic waistband, fingers hooking slightly underneath it.\u00a0 Definitely uncomfortable, Midoriya would decide, and without a second thought, tear the boxers down. \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s hard cock would spring free, bobbing in front of Midoriya\u2019s grinning mouth. \u00a0\nMidoriya would give an experimental lick, right on the head. \u00a0Todoroki moaned. \u201cPlease, more\u2026\u201d he whispered.\u00a0\n\u201cShouto?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya would say, lips teasing at the tip of his cock. \u201cAre you alright? I\u2019m pretty sure I smell smoke!\u201d\nReality suplexed Todoroki harshly, his eyes popping open.\u00a0 He lurched fully upright, head spinning, and oh god he was near smoking wasn\u2019t he, so, addled brain free of the cruel mistress of Rationality, he lunged with his unoccupied hand and turned the shower dial all the way towards C.\nThen promptly yelped, because Jesus  fuck that was cold, especially for someone who didn\u2019t normally need to endure extreme temperatures, and poor poor Todoroki Junior was not happy, losing blood more quickly than a shanking victim. \u00a0Since when did the dorm showers respond so quickly to instructions, anyways?!\nAnd fuck, now his head was starting to pound, Midoriya had asked a question\u2014\u201cI\u2019m alright now! \u00a0I was just uh\u2026 lost in thought.\u201d\nThoughts of deflowering the same boy who was standing just mere meters away, sure, but thoughts indeed, and Midoriya seemed satisfied by the reply. \u00a0It was high time to get out of this shower.\nToweling off and throwing his clothes on rather haphazardly, Todoroki threw open the bathroom door, only to spot his friend--yes,  friend-- situated adorably on his bed, criss cross style. \u00a0A real 10/10, A+ Midoriya.\nOut of the frying pan and into the fire, huh. \u00a0\n\u201cHey, Shouto.\u201d \u00a0Midoriya smiled. \u00a0\u201cI went ahead and changed into some of your pajamas, if that\u2019s ok!\u201d\nSo he had. \u00a0\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Todoroki forced out, rather occupied noticing the way that the too-large t shirt dipped beneath Midoriya\u2019s strong collarbone. \u00a0Todoroki Junior twitched; apparently he wasn\u2019t gonna let that polar bear plunge keep him down for long.\u00a0 If nothing else, let it never be said that Todoroki lacked resilience.\nCatching himself staring, Todoroki tore his eyes from his good, platonic friend and sat down opposite of him, painfully aware of every creak the bed squealed out.\u00a0 Why was Todoroki cursed to ooze awkwardness with every action?\u00a0 For a mere twin bed, that thing sure could generate an ungodly amount of sound.\u00a0 Maybe he should\u2019ve thought about that particular impracticality to stave off his little foray into fantasy while in the shower. \u00a0Yeah, the sarcastic part of his brain replied, it really would've calmed him down to think\u00a0about how much his puny little bed would creak while he passionately rocked into Midoriya.\nHe definitely\u00a0should\u2019ve\u00a0thought about it then, and not now. \u00a0Todoroki Junior helpfully introduced the concept of Midoriya producing sounds of his own, making Todoroki Sr. swallow, and Jesus Christ, speaking of noisy acts, Todoroki was pretty sure that singular swallow had breached a hundred decibels. \u00a0\nWhy did he have to be the most awkward human being on the planet?!\n\u201cSo,\u201d Midoriya began, and Todoroki absolutely did not nearly jump out of his skin with the sudden word. \u00a0\u201cWhat do you wanna do now?\u201d\nTodoroki leaned back on his arms, looking up at the ceiling in contemplation. \u00a0Just be chill.  \u00a0\u201cTo be completely honest, I really want to do you.\u201d\nIt took all of 5 seconds for Midoriya to turn completely red, and for Todoroki\u2019s soul to vacate his body. \u00a0\u201cW-w-w-w-wha,\u201d Midoriya sputtered, well on his way to a Guinness world record for longest consecutive stutter, until Todoroki graciously interrupted.\n\u201cYeah, when I said I was lost in thought earlier, I was actually jerking off thinking about us sleeping in the same bed,\u201d he blurted, before he could even think, react, throw himself out the window. \u00a0\u201cNot just sleeping, obviously, but I feel really bad for thinking about that stuff because you\u2019re still my best friend even though you\u2019re super hot and have an amazing ass and sometimes I catch myself staring and remember that one time I set the gym on fire? \u00a0That\u2019s because you were\u2014\u201c\nTodoroki slapped a hand over his mouth as hard as he could manage, knocking his teeth painfully. \u00a0What the hell was going on?! This wasn\u2019t part of the quirk, he hadn\u2019t bargained for this, Midoriya looked like he\u2019d been punched in the gut, Todoroki had never been more embarrassed - holy hell\u00a0Midoriya\u2019s expression - and an excruciating cramp seized Todoroki\u2019s sides. \u00a0\nTodoroki gasped in pain, parting his mouth just enough for disaster to strike.\u00a0 \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t even touch one night when I had a dream - \u201d Todoroki\u2019s heart stopped.\u00a0 He knew this dream. \u201c - where you were wearing a uniform skirt - \u201d\u00a0\u00a0No no no no, stop!\u00a0 \u201c - and a blouse, but let me tell you, the blouse didn\u2019t last long - \u201d\nA resounding thwack cut Todoroki off, and he felt dizzy from just how hard he\u2019d slammed the pillow against his face. \u00a0His words, blessedly, were effectively muffled, at least for the time being. \u00a0\u00a0\nHe needed to find a way around this, and fast, because no way in fuck was Todoroki going to finally reveal his feelings for Midoriya like, like this, this coerced word vomit. \u00a0\nNot like Midoriya hadn\u2019t definitely put two and two together by now, but Todoroki wanted to profess an \u2018official\u2019 confession, with flowery words and flowery bouquets, with sweet, heartfelt sentiments. \u00a0Todoroki may not be a modern Casanova, but he could do better than this, and Midoriya definitely deserved the best Todoroki had to offer,\u00a0more\u00a0than the best. \u00a0Not -\n\u201c - I get turned on when you kick ass in fights - \u201d \u00a0Todoroki increased the pressure of the pillow, feeling lightheaded. \u00a0\n\u201cS-shouto?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya looked legitimately frightened. \u00a0\u201cSomething is definitely wrong, we, we need to get Recovery Girl or someth -crap, she\u2019s travelling. \u00a0B-but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m gonna fix this for you, Shouto. \u00a0Shouto?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s face blurred, and Todoroki swayed. \u00a0Oh yeah, breathing was a thing. Or wasn\u2019t, now, with this pillow, and his stomach was convulsing and lungs aching and head swimming and Midoriya was reaching out to touch him, oh no.\nSo Todoroki fled, hit Eject without a parachute and booked it to the door, flinging it open with the last bits of oxygen floating in his blood. \u00a0\n\u201cW-wait!\u201d \u00a0Midoriya called from back in the room, but Todoroki kept running, skidding to a halt before the door to the stairwell.\u00a0\u00a0No other choice; maybe it\u2019ll stop Midoriya, also.\nWith his throbbing mind made up, Todoroki dashed inside, throwing the door shut behind him as he raced down the stairs. \u00a0\nHalfway down, he removed the pillow from his face, gasping violently as he finally rounded the final corner and set his sights on the next flight of stairs and then--\n\nThwump!\n\nTodoroki\u2019s (slobbery) pillow flew into the great unknown as the teen found himself tumbling rather painfully onto the ground, his vision swimming. \u00a0Jesus, his jaw hurt, and what the hell had even happened in the first place, had Midoriya followed him?, and why was his pillow across the room when all he wanted to do was nap or perish or\u2014\n\u201cShut the fuck up about your shitty pillow and get the hell off of me!\u201d \u00a0A voice screamed in Todoroki\u2019s ear--which was a great help for his headache, really--and Todoroki suddenly registered the  very warm body underneath him.\nAs well as the sparking of an explosion-in-the-works dangerously close to Todoroki\u2019s face.\n\u201cB-Bakugou?! \u00a0What in the hell, I thought you were with Kirishima, you know,\u00a0making out, which to be honest I was kinda jealous of because I-\u201d\nThe sparks grew hotter, and Todoroki\u2019s oxygen-deprived brain finally registered the actual likelihood of death.\n\u201cF-fuck, cool it with the explosions, one scar is more than enough.\u201d\n\u201cThen move your ass!\u201d \u00a0Christ, they really were close--practically laying on top of each other. \u00a0Like that contrived ecchi scenario he\u2019d thought of earlier, but with the worst possible plot twist.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear about your weird fucking ecchi fantasies, just get the fucking fuck away!\u201d \u00a0Bakugou grabbed Todoroki by the shoulders and began pushing them apart, until Todoroki\u2019s knee followed perhaps the most disastrous route since the passage of the  Titanic and feather-light, ever so lightly, brushed against\u2026\n\u201cOh my god you have a boner.\u201d\nA beat. \u00a0\u201cHoly shit you\u2019re huge!\u201d\nIt took no less than three seconds for Bakugou\u2019s face to fill with a truly brilliant red and for his face to perform a violent jig between pride and mortal embarrassment, expression morphing to and fro. \u00a0\u201cH-hell yeah it\u2019s big, and y-you, Kirishima just left to take a piss for a second, alright, this isn\u2019t because of you, got it, you fucking, fucking stop sign bitch!\u201d\n\u201cOh my god I\u2019m laying on top of you while you have a boner and I\u2019m gonna need so much therapy and I\u2014\u201c\nBakugou seized Todoroki\u2019s collar, yanking them nose to nose. \u00a0\u201cIf you so much as blab a single fucking  syllable about this,\u201d \u00a0he growled, \u201cI will personally escort your innards to--\u201d\n\u201cSh-shouto? \u00a0Kacchan?\u201d\nTwo heads whipped around and beheld a very wobbly Midoriya, whose legs looked well on their way to mutiny.\n\u201cDeku?!\"\u00a0\u00a0Bakugou roared, just as Todoroki yelled a desperate \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like, Izuku! \u00a0Even if Bakugou does have a boner. A  big one.\u201d\n\u201cOh you are fucking  dead.\u201d \u00a0Bakugou seethed, rolling over so that he was on top and cocking his fist threateningly. \u00a0Yet somehow the threat didn\u2019t land very well, as Bakugou hunched over him awkwardly, making sure to hold his hips up as far as possible from Todoroki\u2019s body.\n\u201cA...boner?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya whispered distantly, legs finally waving a white flag as he more collapsed than sat on the stairs behind him.\nSparks began crackling over Bakugou\u2019s fist. \u00a0\u201cHalf and Half is about to become nothing and...nothing.\u201d\n\u201cNot your best work,\u201d \u00a0Todoroki\u2019s stupid, stupid mouth supplied, and Bakugou\u2019s face glew impossibly brighter.\n\u201cI must be dreaming,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya muttered in the background. \u00a0\u201cPlease tell me this is a dream. I never would\u2019ve, I didn\u2019t ever expect...you can do so much better, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d \u00a0Bakugou turned to shoot a glare at Midoriya, buying Todoroki precious seconds before death. \u00a0\n\u201cIzuku, please, it\u2019s really not what it looks like, even though it looks like I was grinding on your childhood bully in the stairwell and okay I just noticed this but he also doesn\u2019t have shirt on. \u00a0But mine is on. Super on. Unless you want me to take it off. Then it\u2019ll be super off.\u201d\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d \u00a0Midoriya groaned, burying his face in his hands.\n\u201cI know it looks bad, Izuku, but when you just consider how stupidly in love with you I am it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to do anything with Bakugou, or anyone else for that matter. \u00a0You\u2019re the only person I dream about, think about so much it feels like I hardly think about anything else, the only person I wanna kiss so bad it hurts. You\u2019re the only one I want to wake up next to in twenty years, to see your beautiful smile light up our home every single day.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki took a deep breath. \u201cAlso you fight good.\u201d\nAnd just like that, he\u2019d done it. \u00a0Said everything\u2014with horrifying ineloquence, but said it nonetheless. \u00a0Said the words that had been so mercilessly restrained within his heart for years, the same heart that was rattling against his ribcage so vigorously that it seemed it might escape.\nAnd Midoriya, oh, he was simply stunning, his gorgeous green eyes widening as a scarred hand clasped at his chest, as the moment slowed and stretched into infinity. \u00a0\nA moment Todoroki could never forget. \u00a0Just him, Midoriya, and-\n\u201cFuck this, man.\u201d\n-Bakugou, who rolled the pair over and all but blasted Todoroki off of him. \u00a0The world pixelated suddenly as Todoroki felt himself whoosh backwards until he felt strong arms steady him, belonging to none other than\u2026\nMidoriya.\u00a0 Todoroki\u2019s entire world sighed in content. \u00a0He turned to face the smaller boy. \u201cIzuku, you\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met, and I want to go get ice cream and watch movies and shitty anime with you, and you\u2019re so strong, holy fuck, I love you, I want you to pick me up and\u2014\u201c\n\u201cFucking gays, need to get a goddamned room,\u201d Bakugou scoffed as he stood, dusted himself off, then beat the hastiest retreat this side of France, not even bothering to collect his discarded tank top as he beelined for the exit.\nThe door slammed with a sharp clank. \u00a0The remaining pair, rooted in place, froze.\u00a0 Todoroki's blood went cold for a split second, then returned to normal.\u00a0\u00a0Huh?\nSilence again.\nUntil Midoriya coughed, wringing his hands. \u00a0\u201cHey Shouto, I\u2026\u201d\nHe cut himself off, and Todoroki took a step forward, shortening the distance between them to about a meter. Midoriya gulped, then visibly gathered himself, straightening. \u00a0\u201cShouto, I\u2019m willing to forget all about this if you want to.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s brows furrowed, his confusion heightened by something else that was... off, that he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on. \u00a0\nBut Midoriya continued before he could voice his concerns. \u00a0\u201cObviously, you got hit by some sort of quirk, or illness, or hell, maybe I really did give you a concussion, but the important thing is that, is that,\u201d Midoriya bit his lip, looking down, \u201cy-you clearly aren\u2019t acting like yourself and I-I, the last thing I want is for things to be awkward with us because some f-freak accident made you come up with all that random stuff.\u201d \u00a0\nHe sucked in a ragged breath, the line between his eyebrows wobbling dangerously. \u00a0\u201cQuirks make people do the c-craziest things, a-act completely irrationally, ya know. \u00a0Y-yeah.\u201d Midoriya trailed off. \u201cEven though it seems like it\u2019s run its course anyways\u2026\u201d\nOf course, that was it! \u00a0The godforsaken quirk had finally run out. \u00a0The 12 hours must have passed! How else could this oppressive silence exist with Midoriya toeing at the ground and Todoroki desperately trying to fit right words together?\nBecause holy shit, he couldn\u2019t let  this  happen, of all things. \u00a0A blatant rejection?\u00a0 Fine. \u00a0It\u2019d suck, but at least Todoroki\u2019s intentions would be clear. \u00a0But this?\u00a0 With Midoriya about five seconds from crying, all because Todoroki was too idiotic to mitigate his own situation and ride it out in solitude? \u00a0Or, at the very least, to fix the mess he\u2019d put himself in?\nNo fucking way.\nSo he closed the gap, grabbed Midoriya by the shoulders and stared right into his watery eyes. \u00a0\u201cI, uh, Midoriya. I-Izuku. I need you to know that, that\u2026\u201d Midoriya\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat I don\u2019t have a concussion.\u201d\nMidoriya blinked once, twice. \u00a0A third time. Then closed his eyes briefly. \u00a0\u201cSure, Shouto.\u201d He opened his eyes again. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s just talk about this later after you\u2019ve had a full night of sleep, what do you say?\u201d\nOh god, no. \u00a0In a Shyamalan-level plot twist, Todoroki found himself missing the quirk\u2019s affliction. \u00a0At least then he could effectively articulate what was on his mind, word-vomit notwithstanding.\nMidoriya sighed, and moved to remove Todoroki\u2019s hands from his shoulders. \u00a0For a brief second, scarred hands covered his own, and something in Todoroki snapped.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since first year!\u201d \u00a0He blurted. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not some lie, or hypnosis, or b-brain damage, or whatever the hell else.\u00a0 I've been acting like a complete idiot all day because I got hit with a quirk that made me tell the truth.\u00a0 B-but that's how you can know that it's really me.\u00a0 Me, Todoroki Shouto, the same Todoroki Shouto that\u2019s known you for three years now!\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s mouth fell open, the puzzle pieces clearly falling together in his mind, and Todoroki may or may not have been shaking, but he forged onward, the words practically tumbling out of his mouth. \u00a0\u201cThe same Todoroki Shouto that\u2019s so happy to call you my best friend. The same Todoroki Shouto that you broke so many fingers to save during first year. \u00a0The same Todoroki Shouto that burnt cookies with you that one time and set off the fire alarm. Then Bakugou yelled at us, even though he\u2019s literally the last person qualified to complain about smoke. \u00a0Besides me.\u201d\nTodoroki took a deep breath. \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s mouth had nearly closed, his face tilting up to stare at Todoroki with such intensity that he felt himself begin to blush.\u00a0\u00a0Well, no use in stopping now.\nTaking Midoriya\u2019s hands in his own, Todoroki pulled him closer. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the same Todoroki Shouto that asks you for help with English every week.\u201d \u00a0He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been fluent since middle school. I\u2019m the same Shouto that was too wimpy to ask you to dance at last year's winter formal, that\u2019s dreamt of kissing you too many times to count.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the same Midoriya Izuku that helped me experience true friendship for the first time in my life, the same Midoriya Izuku that inspires everyone I know to work harder, to become the most they can be.\u201d \u00a0Todoroki squeezed Midoriya\u2019s hands. \u201cThe same Midoriya Izuku that I once burnt a shirt off to try and impress. The same Izuku who I love so much that I can\u2019t believe it took me a goddamn quirk to make me confess.\u201d \u00a0\nOh Christ, he was shaking pretty badly, wasn\u2019t he, and that was to say nothing of his voice cracking all over the place. \u00a0Not to mention his sweaty hands, which of course Midoriya could feel. Geez, he probably seemed so lame, especially with that pathetic excuse of a confession, now poor Midoriya was gonna have to walk on eggshells around him because he had completely ruined their dynamic and crossed all of the lines and\u2014\n\u201cDid you actually burn off a shirt to try and show off your abs? \u00a0I mean, I\u2019m assuming it was your abs...\u201d\nAand cue the record scratch.\n\u201cEh?\u201d \u00a0Todoroki went even deeper scarlet. \u00a0\u201cI, well. What happened was- well, I kinda got carried away during that whole monologue and, um, not everything I said is super important, aha, I\u2014\"\n\u201cJust answer the question, Shouto.\u201d \u00a0Oh god, Midoriya was grinning, and it was so fucking adorable.\nHow could Todoroki say no to that smile? \u00a0\u201cYeah. Uraraka convinced me it was a good idea.\u201d \u00a0\nTodoroki felt many things as Midoriya burst out laughing. \u00a0Firstly, he felt embarrassed, to go ahead and round out the motif of the day. \u00a0Secondly, he felt delightfully dazed; for a laughing Midoriya a lovely sight did make. \u00a0\nThirdly, he felt a sudden, wet pressure on his lips. \u00a0Then hands in his hair.\u00a0 Then warm breath on his neck as Midoriya pulled back. \u00a0\u201cYou should thank her, then.\u201d\u00a0 Green hair tickled Todoroki\u2019s neck as Midoriya nuzzled against his chest. \u00a0\u201cBecause it totally worked.\u00a0 Also, you better fess up about that uniform skirt dream of yours, mister.\u201d\n\"Yes, sir.\"\u00a0 Todoroki grinned into Midoriya\u2019s hair, tightening his arms around Midoriya\u2019s back.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNow what were we up to?\u201d \u00a0Midoriya\u2019s muffled voice mused. \u00a0\nTodoroki wasted no time in reminding him, grabbing Midoriya\u2019s chin and planting a kiss on those perfect, perfect lips.\nThen another. \u00a0And another. And about 10 more for good measure. \u00a0Todoroki kissed the  shit out of that boy.\nTodoroki felt scarred hands ball up in his t-shirt, the reverberation of Midoriya\u2019s satisfied hums curled up in the back of his throat, and his own heart pounding so loudly it\u2019d put a 21 gun salute to shame. \u00a0\nTodoroki also felt the draft from the stairwell air conditioning tickle the back of his neck, and certainly did not feel the seconds turn into minutes as he continued to lay an all-out onslaught of kisses on Midoriya.\nBut most of all, Todoroki felt complete. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
