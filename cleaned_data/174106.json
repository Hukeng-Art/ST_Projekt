    "text": "An exuberant knock rattled the door to Spock\u2019s quarters. Spock took his time in shutting off his PADD and stood to straighten his uniform.\n\u201cCome.\u201d\nThe door whizzed open; in the entryway stood a tall man in science blues, his lips curled in a smirk. He swaggered into the room as if he knew Spock \u2013 which, to be clear, he did not.\n\u201cCommander,\u201d he said with a slight nod. \u201cBones sent me to detain you for a physical. Apparently you\u2019ve been dodging the draft.\u201d\nSpock could only deduce that \u2018Bones\u2019 was Dr. McCoy. He had difficulty, however, recognizing the bright blue eyes before him. That in itself was unusual, as this crewman had quite... extraordinary features. Spock blandly inspected the medical officer and betrayed none of his initial curiosity. This was not difficult as his trepidation at being corralled for a physical was most prominent in his mind.\n\u201cI will report to sickbay when I have the spare time, Ensig \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNurse,\u201d he corrected firmly. \u201cNurse Kirk. You can call me Jim, though. Everyone else does.\u201d\n\u201cNurse Kirk,\u201d Spock amended with a narrowed look. He did not appreciate being interrupted. \u201cMy physical should be considered low priority. As First Officer of this vessel, I have duties that are of far more import than an unnecessary trip to sickbay.\u201d\nKirk\u2019s gaze never wavered from his face. \u201cNothing is more important than your health, Commander.\u201d\nSpock folded his arms across his chest. \u201cI am in perfect health.\u201d\nKirk rolled his eyes. \u201cMantra of the Vulcans, if you ask me. You know, wishing it so doesn\u2019t actually make it so.\u201d\n\u201cI did not insinuate anything of the sort.\u201d\nThe nurse mirrored Spock\u2019s stance and took several deliberate steps closer. Spock recognised this as an intimidation tactic and refused to be moved. Kirk searched Spock\u2019s face in silence for three-point-seven seconds, before a slow smile illuminated his features.\n\u201cMr. Spock,\u201d Kirk drawled in a deceptively warm tone. \u201cAre you aware that ear infections are the number one health concern in modern day Vulcans? That \u2013 despite your exceptional ability for physical self-awareness \u2013 it's virtually impossible to detect the early onset of otitis media until it becomes extremely uncomfortable? Were you also aware that should such a trivial infection go undiagnosed, it could lead to mastoiditis? And that, Commander, can lead to deafness, blood poisoning, meningitis \u2013 and in extreme cases \u2013 brain damage. Now, either submit to a twenty minute physical, or potentially risk deafness and a subsequent drop in your work proficiency.\u201d\nKirk looked up and flashed a flawlessly white smile, which Spock assumed some people would consider charming. Of course, Spock was beyond such labels. And he was far too perturbed with the situation to take notice of the wrinkles splaying from the corners of the nurse\u2019s eyes.\nNurse Kirk cocked his head to the side at Spock\u2019s prevailing silence. \u201cCome with me, Commander.\u201d\nSpock could only fully comprehend that he had complied when he found himself inside a private examination room. He sat on the bed in his undergarments and mutely watched Nurse Kirk snap on a pair of latex gloves. His hands looked particularly large in them; Kirk\u2019s fingertips strained against the material until it was nearly clear.\nKirk noticed him watching and grinned. \u201cThis\u2019ll dull any transference between us. You might receive some residual emotion from me, but I promise to only think happy, kinky thoughts, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI would prefer your thoughts remain on the task at hand,\u201d Spock replied tightly.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re my task at hand, Mr. Spock.\u201d Kirk practically purred his name, and Spock noted with displeasure that his flesh prickled in response. \u201dHence the happy, kinky thoughts - Oh!\u201d he exclaimed, hovering a hand down Spock\u2019s arm, without making physical contact. \u201cYou must be freezing with your nearly-naked self sitting here. Hold on.\u201d\nKirk buzzed around the room and grabbed a tall, floor-length lamp from the corner. He brought it over and flicked a switch. Immediately, Spock was bathed in warming light. No Human doctor or nurse had ever thought to utilise a heating lamp during Spock\u2019s physicals. The medical facility was often set at a lower temperature from the rest of the ship and consequently warded off Spock\u2019s Vulcan physiology. Of course Spock could adjust his internal body temperature, but Kirk\u2019s gesture in itself was logical.\n\u201cYou appear to \u2013\u201d Spock nearly stuttered when Nurse Kirk proceeded into the examination without another word. Spock allowed his right eyelid to be pulled up as he stared directly into a light. \u201cBe well-versed in Vulcan \u2013\u201c\n\u201cLook up.\u201d\n\u201cAnatomy.\u201d\n\u201cLook down. I am.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you gain \u2013\u201c\n\u201cLook to the right, please.\u201d\n\u201cSuch knowledge?\u201d\n\u201cVesht Ah\u2019rak. To the left.\u201d\nSpock restrained a shiver. Past Vulcan.\n\u201cDid you receive medical training there?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. Close your inner eyelid for me.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it you are aware of my \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWould you please close it, Mr. Spock? Thanks.\u201d\nMerely \u2018not really\u2019 in reply? Spock frowned faintly and remained silent and meditative as Nurse Kirk inspected his other eye, as well as his throat and ears. It was highly unusual to come across a Human with an extensive knowledge of Vulcan biology. Fascinating.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re all clear there,\u201d Kirk announced as he turned away to grab a particularly complex medical tricorder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got fantastic eyes, though. Inner eyelid aside, they\u2019re completely Human. You\u2019ve got tear ducts and everything. Awesome genetic anomaly you\u2019ve got goin\u2019.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s face stiffened. \u201cI am aware of my deficient anatomy, Nurse Kirk.\u201d\nKirk returned to his place in front of Spock, standing between his knees. His brow furrowed slightly and his smile was slow and slightly befuddled. \u201cSpock, you have beautiful eyes. I understand that a good majority of Vulcans are closet ethnocentrics, but fuck \u2018em if they can\u2019t accept a unique and special being like yourself.\u201d\nHe sounded like Spock\u2019s mother, despite the additional vulgarity. Spock parted his lips to speak, but resolved that he could not formulate a proper reply to such a speech. Nurse Kirk did not appear to take offense, as he began to run the tricorder along his body, stopping every three to five seconds to check a reading.\n\u201cOkay, cool. Could you lay down for me, Mr. Spock?\u201d\nSpock complied, his thoughts still attempting to piece together the growing puzzle of Jim Kirk. Unfortunately, Spock found himself rather disconcerted by the physical contact of the moment. Fingertips hindered by thin, cool latex pressed firmly here and brushed there, and counted each individual rib with a drag of thumb.\nRather than unravelling the curiosity of this nurse who reverently spoke of Vulcan in the decimated planet\u2019s native tongue, Spock found himself cataloguing other intriguing factors. Namely, the scar on Kirk\u2019s chin \u2013 his thick, pale lashes and the freckle beside his nose.\nHe had not realised he had said, \u201cYou do not exude emotion through touch like an average Human,\u201d until Kirk paused, hand on Spock\u2019s heart, and rose both eyebrows in a lofty look.\n\u201cI\u2019m not average,\u201d he replied with simple aplomb. He gently prodded a spot beneath Spock\u2019s heart. \u201cThis uncomfortable?\u201d\n\u201cNegative,\u201d Spock murmured, although his heart had done a curious flip in his side.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kirk said with an easy smile and a brusque tone. \u201cYou\u2019re done. You can get dressed.\u201d He patted Spock\u2019s thigh once and then shifted to pick up a PADD. Intent on making notes in what Spock assumed was his medical records, Kirk chatted while Spock dressed.\n\u201cTaking into account the inevitable curiosities of your genetic construction, you\u2019re basically in the peak of health. Blood pressure\u2019s on the low spectrum for a Vulcan, but that\u2019s to be expected. I expect you\u2019ve noticed before that your healing rate is below average for a Vulcan as well,\u201d Kirk added, looking up as Spock slipped on his tunic. Spock banked the inevitable self-deprecation he experienced upon hearing he was different and did not reply.\nThat languid, knowing smile crossed Kirk\u2019s expression once more. He continued on with his previous commentary. \u201cWhich is fine. You\u2019re still super-humanly bad-ass. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t run into needlessly dangerous situations or else you and me will become fast friends.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot promise you that.\u201d\nKirk chuckled and made another note on his PADD. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect you to.\u201d\nSpock squared his shoulders, looked Nurse Kirk in the eye and nodded. \u201cGoodbye, Nurse Kirk.\u201d\nOnce more, those crinkles in the corners of his eyes appeared. \u201cBye, Commander.\u201d\n***\nA calming vision of tranquil blue irises and dishevelled sandy hair wavered and blurred in Spock\u2019s line of vision.\n\u201cHi,\u201d a warm, familiar voice said quietly. \u201cNot exactly the way I\u2019d hoped to see you again.\u201d\nPain tore at his side and Spock\u2019s eyes rolled up in his head. Faintly, he heard Dr. McCoy barking orders at his attendants. Then there was silence.\nThe next memory that enveloped him was that of blissful weightlessness \u2013 then seeping discomfort \u2013 and finally, the harsh fluorescent glare of artificial light pressing against his gritty eyelids. Each stage of consciousness dragged on for an indeterminable span of time, and when he awoke, well \u2013 he was surprised to find he awoke at all. Spock eyes fluttered open and for a moment the world was portrayed through a disorienting fisheye lens.\n\u201cMr. Spock?\u201d\nSpock squinted and focused on the voice.\n\u201cIdiot. You\u2019re lucky I was here, y\u2019know. Bones was totally clueless about your fuckin\u2019 healing trance. Everyone thought you were flat-lining. I was gonna slap you awake then and there, just to prove a point.\u201d\nSpock wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. \u201cIt \u2013\u201d His voice was hoarse from disuse. His internal chronometer told him he had been in meditation for two days, three hours, and seventeen minutes. \u201cIt was a light trance. Implementing physical force to rouse me would have been unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d Kirk snapped. \u201cDuhsu.\u201d\nSpock wondered if it was the pain medication in his system that caused his lips to twitch. \u201cI am not a fool.\u201d\n\u201cOnly fools step in front of Klingon fire.\u201d There\u2019s a sigh and a shifting beside him. \u201cI\u2019ve got shit to do, now. Glad you\u2019re feeling better, Commander.\u201d\nThen it was quiet. And for the first time in his life Spock realised he was not fond of the silence.\n***\nSpock had definitively concluded that there were too many fair-haired men on the Enterprise. On nine occasions in the past month he had experienced that same arrhythmic heart palpitation at the distant flash of dark blonde hair. When he came to realise it was not the person whom he had initially assumed, his mood was soured for the entirety of the day.\nNaturally, he would not purposely injure himself for the sake of visiting sickbay. Absolutely not. But he did not argue on the three occasions in which he was sent to the facility after a mission gone awry.\nNever on any of these occasions did he see Jim Kirk. In the end he would be uncomfortably mended by a muttering McCoy, or overly-handled by Nurse Chapel\u2019s insistent hands. This also left him with a wrathful disposition for the remainder of his day.\nIt was all highly illogical and increasingly detrimental to his mental discipline.\nFor example, it was sheer lunacy that Spock was currently indescribably pleased to have broken his arm. He serenely allowed Nurse Kirk to adjust his injured limb beneath the regenerator, where bare, capable hands shifted at his elbow, his wrist, his shoulder.\n\u201cWere you taught Vulcan at Starfleet Academy?\u201d Spock asked. He only realised he had wished to know this fact until after he had spoken. \u201cYour accent is not like that of Standard-speaking students.\u201d\nSpock caught Kirk\u2019s amused glance and held the eye contact.\n\u201cThanks. That\u2019s quite a compliment coming from a Vulcan.\u201d\nSpock brows drew together. \u201cYou did not answer my query.\u201d\nKirk hummed under his breath and nodded. With one final check on the regenerator, he wiped his hands on his hips and shrugged. \u201cI lived on Vulcan for a while.\u201d\nTaken aback, Spock could only blink at the nurse. \u201cWhat length of stay constitutes as \u2018a while\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cNine years from when I was ten? Give or take \u2013 maybe a little more.\u201d Someone called for Kirk\u2019s attention, and he threw a glance over his shoulder. When he looked back, his smile was slightly apologetic. \u201cI gotta go. See ya around, Commander.\u201d\nOnce again, Spock was abandoned. He stared at the retreating back of a man who continued to make less and less sense.\n***\n\u201cBased on the time period in which you resided on Vulcan, it should have been possible that we crossed paths in the past.\u201d\nKirk breathed a soft laugh through his nose. His face was so close to Spock\u2019s temple that he could feel the cool gust of air against his skin. Kirk continued his delicate ministrations on repairing Spock\u2019s ear. Phaser fire had nicked the tip and required a dermal regenerator the size of a stylus.\n\u201cI doubt that. You grew up in Shi\u2019kahr, right? I was in Dahhanakahr. Close, but not close enough that we\u2019d have had a chance to meet. Although I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have liked me if had you met me at the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Despite your generally informal and occasionally crude demeanour, you are an adequate individual.\u201d\nSpock tucked away the ping of pleasure he experienced in his chest when Kirk chuckled.\n\u201cI was a dick of a kid \u2013 asshole of a teen. When my mom deemed my life on Earth unsuitable and dangerous, she decided to throw me into a totally foreign culture and continued to whisk herself across the galaxy. Apparently the logic behind it was that Vulcan was closer to her Starbase, and Vulcan learning institutions would be more challenging for me.\u201d\n\u201cWere they?\u201d\nKirk\u2019s thumb slid against his earlobe and Spock finally felt a brand of emotion imprint into his flesh. Amusement \u2013 bemusement \u2013 melancholy.\n\u201cGuess so,\u201d he replied shortly. \u201cI don\u2019t regret my time there, at least.\u201d Kirk quieted, and Spock could feel the intensity of his gaze upon his neck. \u201cI was there, y\u2019know. Evacuating kids and doctors from the children\u2019s hospital I was volunteering at.\u201d\n\u201cAs was I,\u201d Spock murmured. He recalled the last time he would ever reach out for his mother, with the knowledge of the inevitable in her dark eyes. The smell of her perfume lingering on the transporter pad; a ghost of a memory engraved on his heart.\nA cool hand cupped the back of Spock\u2019s neck \u2013 affection \u2013 and Kirk\u2019s hushed voice in his ear \u2013 compassion. \u201cS'ti th'laktra.\u201d\nI grieve with thee.\nSpock shut his eyes, and thanked him. \u201cShaya tonat.\u201d\nThey were silent for the remainder of time. The rhythmic thrum of connection from the steadying hand at Spock\u2019s nape felt more intimate than any moment he could recall from his past. Then Kirk\u2019s fingers were slipping from his skin, and gone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re finished.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nKirk smiled and Spock could only helplessly stare back.\n\u201cVulcans don\u2019t give thanks. Just stop injuring yourself.\u201d\nHow else would I see you?\n\u201cI shall endeavour to do so.\u201d\nKirk rolled his eyes. He patted Spock\u2019s uniform-clad wrist. \u201cSure you will. Now get back to your post, Commander.\u201d\n\u201cAye, sir.\u201d\n***\nHis shin seared as if it had been shattered into pieces. And to some extent, it had. Spock stared down at the fibula that jut through the skin of his shin and bit back another wave of nausea.\nTheir captors had known that he, as a Vulcan, would not perish from a break such as this; but it would hinder him from attempting to rouse a plan of escape. Spock\u2019s body went into a short convulsion as he watched the cell floor stain green.\n\u201cSpock \u2013 Spock! You need to look at me.\u201d\n\u201cJim?\u201d Yes, Nurse Kirk. He had come on the mission; filling in Doctor McCoy\u2019s spot while the CMO devised an antidote for the mysterious affliction that plagued his crewmembers.\nWarm hands on his face \u2013 warm? Spock was cool. Possibly cold. He swallowed the thick lump of bile in his throat and followed that firm voice to its owner. \u201cJim.\u201d\n\u201cSpock, listen to me very carefully.\u201d Kirk\u2019s eyes were steady and earnest. His fingertips dug lightly into Spock\u2019s scalp. \u201cThey took my medical supplies. I\u2019ve staunched the bleeding from the knee, but there\u2019s nothing I can do for the pain.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Spock gasped, knocking his head back against the well and looking to the dank ceiling. \u201cSomehow I had an inkling of that.\u201d\nKirk\u2019s laugh was more of a hoarse cough. \u201cShut up, Mr. Spock.\u201d\nSoothing hands caressed his mind-meld points; a gentle pressure. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to do something, and you\u2019re just gonna have to trust me.\u201d Spock did not have the will to nod or shake his head and Nurse Kirk continued on without pause. \u201cYou need to let down your shields for me, Spock. You need to let me in.\u201d\nSpock lurched forward, his eyes snapping to Kirk\u2019s.\n\u201cStop that \u2013 don\u2019t move. You need to do what I say. I\u2019m just a Human, I can\u2019t meld with you, or even look into you. But I can help \u2013 let me help.\u201d\nMuch to Spock\u2019s distant dismay, his breathing grew laboured and shallow. Pain seized his body, radiating from the marrow, to his hands and eyes and hair follicles. Kirk snapped his fingers before his face, and Spock\u2019s blurring gaze darted around, following the movement.\n\u201cLet me in, Spock!\u201d\nFinger pads pressed and implored his temples and jawline.\nSpock let go, and Kirk was there as if he always had been; enveloping him like a blanket.\nHis voice was quick-fire in Spock\u2019s ear. \u201cRemember enok-ka-fi, Spock. Enok-ka-fi. Pain is only in the mind. It\u2019s neurons and brain waves and signals to a corporeal body that you have complete control over. Pain is conjecture. Don\u2019t forget. Conquer it, Spock. Come on, ashal-veh.\u201d\nDarling?\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Spock murmured, before the pain abetted and he promptly lost consciousness.\nWhen he regained his senses, it was with a familiar scent in the air. Sickbay. And a strange sound \u2013 snoring. Kirk was folded awkwardly in a chair, his legs hanging over the arm.\nSpock warily shifted in the bio-bed. A sharp sting shot up his leg, but nothing unbearable. A jingle from one of the monitors announced his improving health, and Nurse Kirk\u2019s eyes snapped open as if he had not been sleeping at all. His face was bruised with fatigue.\n\u201cHey Commander,\u201d he slurred, offering a slow smile. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cAs if I have recently broken my fibula.\u201d\nKirk dragged a hand through his hair and snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot funnier when you\u2019re injured, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cI do not see how that is possible.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you just let your guard down,\u201d Kirk supplied; but his grin faltered. Plausibly, he was reliving the same moment Spock was.\n\u201cI would have endured considerably higher amounts of pain had it not been for your expertise.\u201d\nKirk shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. You perform the task adequately. However, you disregarded a risk in pursuing close contact with my mind during such a... chaotic moment. I could have psychically incapacitated you by accident.\u201d\nAnother shrug as Kirk got to his feet, his joints cracking. \u201cNecessary risks.\u201d\nSpock wished to inquire how long Nurse Kirk had remained at his bedside. Instead, he said nothing.\nKirk laid a hand atop the blanket, resting upon Spock\u2019s uninjured knee. He squeezed lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back, Mr. Spock.\u201d\nHis cheeks warmed. \u201cI did not go anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d\n***\nOne month, eight days, four hours and twelve minutes had elapsed since Spock had last encountered Nurse Kirk. He was unsure when he had begun defining the quality of his life by the length of time he spent in the man\u2019s company. Nonetheless, it was an alarming discovery.\nThe past weeks had involved a series of peaceful, diplomatic missions that in no way required Spock to visit sickbay. And although no one would question his presence there (perhaps McCoy, but he could be ignored), Spock knew he would feel as if he were neglecting his duties as First Officer by pursuing a member of their staff for personal gain.\nSpock had meditated extensively on the conundrum of his growing attachment to Jim Kirk. His sleep cycle had suffered for it. And perhaps when Captain Pike mentioned he looked a bit wan, Spock had suggested rather hastily that he see a doctor. Just to be prudent over his health, of course. Pike had appeared bewildered but had nodded his assent and waved him off.\nUnfortunately, it was Dr. McCoy who took note of his presence.\n\u201cWhy\u2019re you lurkin\u2019 around my sickbay, Spock?\u201d the doctor demanded with narrowed eyes.\nSpock paused and chose his words with care. \u201cCaptain Pike suggested I report for an examination. Please direct me to Nurse Kirk.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not available.\u201d McCoy\u2019s eyes darted towards his office and back to Spock. \u201cNothin\u2019 that I can\u2019t help you with, I\u2019m sure. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cI would prefer to speak with Nurse Kirk on the matter,\u201d Spock enunciated slowly. His gaze locked on McCoy\u2019s door as he spoke. \u201cAlthough your expertise cannot be rivalled in Starfleet, Nurse Kirk\u2019s knowledge of Vulcan ailments makes him the ideal primary consultant for my needs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dandy speech you\u2019ve prepared, but I just don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d Dr. McCoy groused. \u201cEither tell me what\u2019s eatin\u2019 ya, or get outta my sickbay. You\u2019re not seein\u2019 Jim.\u201d\nSpock stamped down on the growing anxiety writhing in his stomach and managed to appear utterly bored of the conversation. \u201cIs there a particular reason Nurse Kirk is not at his station?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I reckon that ain\u2019t any of your business,\u201d he drawled. \u201cDoctor-patient confidentiality and all.\u201d\n\u201cAs First Officer of this ship it is, as you say, my business.\u201d\n\u201cHow, exactly?\u201d\nSpock clenched his jaw. \u201cDoctor McCoy, you will either elaborate upon Nurse Kirk\u2019s whereabouts or you will stand by as I utilise my override code to enter your office. You may choose either option, as I have no preference.\u201d\nFor a tense eleven-point-two seconds, they stared at each other. Spock did not blink. Eventually, Dr. McCoy approached him too closely and hissed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect someone like you to know this, because it\u2019s not like you give a flyin\u2019 fuck about the little people down here \u2013 but it happens to be Jim\u2019s birthday today.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s eyebrows rose in silent question, and McCoy sneered. \u201cSmart guy like you never made the connection? The first Narada incident with the U.S.S. Kelvin ring any bells? The man who sacrificed himself to save the entire crew, including his wife and son?\u201d\n\u201cKirk,\u201d Spock murmured with growing realisation. \u201cGeorge Kirk. His father \u2013\u201c\n\u201cDied today, so many years ago,\u201d McCoy finished. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure even a machine like you can get why I ain\u2019t letting anyone near him. Kid\u2019s a mess.\u201d\nSpock calmly inspected McCoy and made a demonstration of straightening his back and nodding stiffly. \u201cI understand, Doctor. I do not require your medical services at this junction.\u201d\nThe doctor flashed him a look of suspicion, but merely grunted, \u201cGood,\u201d and stalked away.\nThe moment McCoy was out of his sight, Spock headed directly to the office door. His fingertips briefly hovered over the keypad. What could he say to Jim? Spock, too, had lost a parent. But their circumstances spanned across widely different spectrums. McCoy had been correct in saying that Kirk should be of no concern to Spock. Yet he was, and that was the only conclusion Spock could focus on.\nInhaling a single, bracing breath, Spock keyed in the code and slipped into the room. The spacious office was cloaked in shadow and indirect light from a dim lamp in the corner. He could smell disinfectant and bourbon and \u2013 Jim.\nSlouched on the sofa in an awkward sitting position was Nurse Kirk. His chin was tilted up, his head resting on the back of the couch. Wedged between his splayed thighs was a half-empty bottle of amber alcohol. Kirk was snoring softly from his nose - a slight wheeze.\nAs Spock took in the prone form before him, the tension in his body began to melt away. If it had simply been Kirk\u2019s thoughtful bedside manner and sharp intelligence that had drawn him in, then it would not be so relaxing to exist in the nurse\u2019s company while he was simply resting.\nIn that moment, Spock had come to understand that there was more to his affinity for Kirk than he initially assumed. The man was unconscious, and yet he still held sway over Spock. Even in slumber, Spock felt quieted by his presence.\nGripping the bourbon bottle by the neck, Spock carefully removed it from between Kirk\u2019s legs. He placed it on Dr. McCoy\u2019s desk and turned to study the man who did not fit in any mould Spock could devise. Kirk consistently demonstrated vitality and vigour in his speech and tactile gestures. Asleep \u2013 or, was it unconscious? \u2013 his face and body were still.\nSpock had never encountered the opportunity to stop and examine him. He found it curious; Kirk appeared more youthful and immature when he was awake and loquacious. Asleep, he resembled a mature man. Despite the soft contours of lips and lashes, there was something strong and solemn about the lines of his face. A dependable nature.\nThis was an invasion of both Dr. McCoy and Kirk\u2019s privacy. He should depart.\nSpock frowned and sat down beside Kirk. The seconds ticked by on an antiquated chronometer on Dr. McCoy\u2019s desk. Spock counted three-hundred and forty-seven clicks before he finally leaned back into the cushions, with his shoulder a mere inch from Kirk\u2019s. Swallowing a lump in his throat, Spock braved a look at the face so close to him. Jim\u2019s breath smelled of acrid alcohol, but his scent was reminiscent of the cinnamon and apple tea his mother had once been so fond of. Spock barely averted the urge to simply nuzzle his nose against Kirk\u2019s unshaven jaw.\nFlicking a look from the door, to Kirk, and repeating the gesture once more, Spock found his control shuddering beneath the weight of his desire. No, not merely desire. The emotion Spock experienced was foreign and complex. A protective form of affection, perhaps. Unwarranted, yes; uncomfortable, certainly. And as much as Spock pivoted the feeling in his mind and studied it from all angles, he could ascertain no way to dislodge it from inside his chest.\nWhen Spock pressed a delicate kiss to the birthmark beside Kirk\u2019s ear, it took every remaining ounce of restraint not to lavish attention on each fascinating freckle he had previously noted on Kirk\u2019s face and arms and hands. With a shamefully human groan, Spock sunk back into the couch. He shut his eyes and refused to look at the man beside him. Deep breaths soothed his frayed control. Each inhale brought the calming aroma of Jim; the exhale expelled his nerves. Sinking back into the seat, Spock allowed himself to drift.\nSpock only realised that he had fallen asleep \u2013 although, when had he lain down? \u2013 when his hand nestled in the soft, thick hair of whomever was lying atop him. With the bleary realisation that it was Jim cuddled against him, Spock murmured his consent and floated back into blissful respite.\nNo. Spock shot up from the couch, his body and mind on full alert.\nUnfortunately, his reaction time had been woefully delayed. To be exact, his lag had been twenty-seven minutes in error. Nurse Kirk was no longer sleeping on the couch, or on him. He was no longer in the room at all. To the end of his days, Spock would swear that his heart ceased to beat.\nHe had no idea how to proceed. This was a deeply regrettable situation. It had not been his intention to engage in any intimacy with \u2013 no. That was fallacy. He had desired to encourage the underlying affinity between them. Spock had come to offer his own ineffectual brand of comfort, and in turn, find solace in the knowledge that he could help Kirk, as the nurse had been previously able to aid him.\nInstead, Spock had reacted in a shamefully Human fashion. His baser red-blooded emotions had seeped to the surface and stained his judgement. Now Nurse Kirk would know of Spock\u2019s aberrant regard for him; no doubt he was disturbed by this revelation. There was no other explanation for Kirk\u2019s soundless escape.\nSpock was being avoided and this was for the best. Nurse Kirk should also be avoided at all costs.\nWith that conclusion encasing his heart, Spock stood and brushed himself off. He did not linger in the room that screamed of his transgressions but slipped through the doors and out of sickbay, utterly unnoticed.\n***\nPlains of verdant green skin stretched thin and angry across Spock\u2019s outstretched palms. He could still feel the lingering sizzle of the Horta\u2019s scalding hide embedded past the first sensitive layer of his fingertips. The creature had not been the only one experiencing pain, but Spock had been required to fulfil his duties, regardless of discomfort. It had been his ingenuity and mediation that had settled the problems on Janus VI. If the Horta\u2019s boiling epidermis had seared off a delicate layer of Spock\u2019s hands \u2013 well, he had not joined Starfleet expecting his own safety.\nHunched slightly on his bed, hands turned up and resting on his knees, Spock mused over his subsequent course of action. Sickbay was not an option. Doctor McCoy would be engrossed in the two officers who had been rescued from a collapsed mine, and that left one other qualified medical practitioner. Spock had competently avoided Nurse Kirk for five weeks, four days and seven hours. First-degree burns would not be enough to coax him into meeting Kirk\u2019s deceptively lazy gaze \u2013 not following the mortifying incident of Nurse Kirk\u2019s birthday.\nSpock had an emergency first aid kit in the fresher. He could heal the excess damage and wait until the next day to visit McCoy. It was a reasonable option. That was what Spock told himself.\nThe door buzzed and Spock went ramrod straight. He stood and gripped his hands lightly behind his back. \u201cCome.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s eyes widened minutely as Nurse Kirk swept inside with his med-kit in hand. Kirk scrutinised Spock with a blank professionalism had Spock wordlessly bristling.\nKirk\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cPike sent me.\u201d\n\u201cHe is an attentive captain, but I am confident that my unscathed condition is apparent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make that decision. Have a seat.\u201d\n\u201cI am already in possession of several chairs, thank you.\u201d\nKirk\u2019s eyes did not flicker. Underlying steel lurked beneath his hushed tone. \u201cLet me help, Mr. Spock.\u201d\nSomething pinched uncomfortably in his chest and Spock primly sat at the foot of the bed. He folded his throbbing hands atop his knees and stared drolly at Kirk. \u201cI must admit that I cannot surmise the purpose of your visit, Nurse Kirk. It is plain that I am in adequate con \u2013\u201d\n\u201cStop attempting to bullshit the bullshitter, Commander.\u201d The chill had abated from his voice, but his movements were brisk and clinical as he set the kit on the floor and sat beside Spock. The mattress groaned, and Spock\u2019s body gravitated toward the concave created by Kirk\u2019s solid weight.\n\u201cI have never been accused of subterfuge under any circumstances,\u201d Spock stated, rather aghast.\nKirk shrugged and leaned forward to pop open the container at his feet. \u201cYeah, well, I have that effect on people.\u201d\nSpock felt his Adam\u2019s apple bob, as the creamy skin at the small of Kirk\u2019s back was exposed by the nurse\u2019s movement. He swallowed quietly and concentrated on the disarray of Kirk\u2019s hair instead. \u201cOf what effect do you speak?\u201d\n\u201cPeople are different around me.\u201d He came up with a medical tricorder and began to scan the length of Spock\u2019s torso. \u201cFor better or worse, they\u2019re always different.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a rather illogical theory.\u201d\nThe tricorder glanced past Spock\u2019s hands and Kirk frowned at his readings. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong \u2013 it\u2019s your statement that\u2019s illogical. If my theory is just that \u2013 a proposed explanation whose solution is conjectural \u2013 then there is no such thing as an illogical theory, unless proven as such. And after it\u2019s been debunked, it ceases to be a theory anyway. Show me your hands.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s heart was tumbling as his mind reeled. \u201cMy hands are easily viewable from this position.\u201d\n\u201cSpock.\u201d Kirk\u2019s gaze was steely. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you extremely uncomfortable in about five seconds if you don\u2019t comply with my orders.\u201d\n\u201cI fail to see how you might accomplish such a thing.\u201d\nKirk\u2019s eyebrows jumped and his lips curled. \u201cYou want me to kiss you? I do know how Vulcan hands work, you know.\u201d\nSpock uttered a strangled noise and obediently presented his scorched palms. He could not tell if Kirk was speaking in earnest, but he did not wish to be enlightened.\nWith the revelation of his damaged skin, Spock had expected some form of admonition other than the utter silence that engulfed the room. Every previous instance of injury had conjured an utterance of disapproval or a strict reprimanding, or even a teasing word. In this case, he was met with suffocating quiet.\nSpock pondered if it was Kirk\u2019s time on Vulcan which accounted for the vacancy of the nurse\u2019s expression. His features were still, with eyes dispassionate and dark as twilight. Chapped lips thinned as Jim looked away and discarded his tricorder for a pair of latex gloves. The sharp snap of plastic to wrist was more a slap in the face than Spock had ever received.\nNurse Kirk retrieved a tube of cooling regenerative salve and squeezed a blob onto his fingertips. Eyes downcast and intense on Spock\u2019s injuries, Kirk took one of Spock\u2019s hands in his own.\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be uncomfortable,\u201d Kirk rasped, and lightly slid his slick fingertips down the centre of Spock\u2019s palm.\nThe gel was a blessed oasis in the dry, desert heat of Spock\u2019s skin. Delicate chills echoed up his fingers, and Spock\u2019s eyelids fluttered at the dulling pain and swelling pleasure radiating from the centre of his palm. Spock reflexively angled towards Kirk, giving him free reign to enfold Spock\u2019s hand in both of his. Both of Kirk\u2019s thumbs artfully massaged the chilly salve into sensitive mounds of flesh and up towards his fingers. Small, gentle circles rubbed the length of each digit with diligence and care. Every glide of Nurse Kirk\u2019s fingers against Spock\u2019s sent fissures of bliss rocketing straight to his core.\nSpock bit down on the inside of his cheek, and purposely fisted his other hand. The flash of pain that seized his arm reminded him of his place and self-control. Relief and regret swamped Spock\u2019s stiff frame when Kirk released his hand with a self-satisfied nod.\nFinally, finally he met Spock\u2019s eyes. Kirk\u2019s pupils were dilated, his lips flushed. \u201cYour other hand.\u201d\nThe casual tone of Kirk\u2019s voice had Spock\u2019s spine straightening, and his need to match the nurse\u2019s nonchalance increased. Voiding his face of expression, Spock held out his other hand with an air of disinterest. Unfortunately, as soon as Kirk\u2019s dedicated ministrations recommenced, Spock found his nerves eroding. A barrage of shivers cascaded across his arms and thighs and Spock grappled for some semblance of reason.\n\u201cIt is uncommon that I experience no residual emotion from such close physical contact, despite the barrier of latex.\u201d\nSpock felt his cheeks heat at the unexpected frustration he had detected in his own voice.\nNurse Kirk\u2019s fingers twitched against Spock\u2019s hypersensitive skin. \u201cFrom what I hear, you should be thankful. Apparently my untrained mind had been too dynamic for the close company I kept with Vulcans.\u201d\nSpock focused on Kirk\u2019s words, rather than the rhythmic slide of soothing fingers on flesh. \u201cYour mind cannot be too dynamic, although I am able to understand why a vibrant Human among Vulcans would cause minor upheaval.\u201d Before he could eradicate the thought, Spock wondered just how compelling Jim Kirk\u2019s mind truly was. \u201cHow were you able to cope?\u201d\n\u201cI met with a specialist once a week. He taught me a thing or two about reining myself in \u2013 which I completely ignored until I returned years later, and started volunteering at the children\u2019s hospital through Starfleet. Sometimes there\u2019s no opportunity to slap on gloves, and in that case you can\u2019t let your panic or doubt seep into a distressed kid\u2019s psyche, y\u2019know?\u201d\nSpock nodded silently, and once again felt bereft as Kirk\u2019s hands slipped away from his own. Spock laid his hands upon his thighs, palms up and watched as Nurse Kirk peeled off his gloves and dropped them into his med-kit. He wiped his hands on his trousers and offered Spock his first grin since he had arrived. \u201cSo, uh, that was an awkward make-out session.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Spock suppressed a scowl. There were times when Humans genuinely spoke a separate language from Standard.\nAmusement glittered in Kirk\u2019s eyes. \u201cNever mind. How do your hands feel?\u201d\nSpock flexed his fingers tentatively. His joints were stiff, but the pain had diminished to a dull, thrumming ache. \u201cI am recuperating sufficiently.\u201d\nJim's jaw flexed. \u201cI'm not going to ask you to be more careful. Just... every time you're about to do something ridiculously dangerous, remember that the Enterprise needs you.\u201d\n\u201cI will endeavour to do so.\u201d\nThe only word Spock could recall that fit the following beats of silence was awkward. Kirk leaned forward to pack up his belongings, and Spock edged away from his close proximity to the nurse. Kirk straightened, his lips weighted down. When he didn\u2019t speak, Spock did.\n\u201cI thank you for your \u2013\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to admit that you like me, or what?\u201d\n\u201c\u2013 Help.\u201d\nKirk wore a distinctly stubborn look that Spock recognised with a spark of panic. What could he say? There was nothing that would not paint him as a fool. Under the circumstances, silence was the most logical option.\nNo - Spock was attempting to fool himself. Silence was illogical at this time, but he could not find the words to express his attraction, or his confusion and embarrassment.\nAfter several seconds of unblinking eye contact, Kirk bit off a, \u201cFuck, Spock,\u201d and pinched the bridge of his nose. Kirk dropped his hand listlessly, his expression intent. \u201cVulcan has made me sick and tired of avoiding and repressing every fucking thing. It\u2019s a lot easier to just spit it out than dance around the issue like we were in some Victorian novel.\u201d\nDespite the confident candour to Kirk\u2019s voice, Spock could see the tension around his eyes. Perhaps Spock was not the only person repressing his anxiety.\nJim shifted on the bed, with his brows drawn together. \u201cAre you gonna say anything, Spock? I mean, if I\u2019m wrong and you don\u2019t like me or are in a relationship or something, you can just say so. I may be a nurse, but I\u2019m not delicate, all right?\u201d\n\u201cJim, I - \u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be embarrassed about before,\u201d Jim rattled on. \u201cNo one\u2019s actually ever just, um, stayed with me. Bones always kind of avoids me, but lurks in the outskirts to clean up the chaos I leave behind. But waking up that day,\u201d Jim\u2019s eyes flicked up and away. \u201cWell, it made me forget for a second why I was trying to get obliterated in the first place.\u201d\nSpock could feel his entire face going up in flame. \u201cJim, I \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking that this can\u2019t possibly work, right? I can\u2019t blame you. Every Vulcan I\u2019d ever felt some kind of an attraction for shot me down before I could even prove myself as something more than an obnoxious Human. Thing is, though \u2013 I am an obnoxious Human.\u201d\nJim\u2019s hands were now gesticulating wildly, his movements growing sharp at the edges. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done trying to prove myself otherwise. I don\u2019t like or want to control myself most of the time, and I think with my heart, dick and mind in equal parts. I\u2019m just a guy. But I think I could \u2013 I mean I know we could \u2013\u201d\nSpock silenced Jim with a tentative kiss. He was unsure if he was going about this correctly, but prudence and sensibility had apparently evaporated.\nThe kiss was brief \u2013 more accurately, a brush of Spock\u2019s lips against the corner of Jim\u2019s open mouth. But the way Jim\u2019s breath hitched and his eyes darkened to cobalt had Spock concluding that he had chosen the correct course of action.\n\u201cYou kiss like a Human,\u201d Jim said, looking rather bewildered.\n\u201cIt quieted you, if only for a moment,\u201d Spock replied dryly.\nJim laughed \u2013 a short, breathless lilt as he dragged a hand through his hair,and stared at Spock with a grin. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a little \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to think. I mean, I know you\u2019re not like any other Vulcan I\u2019ve met \u2013 and I love that. But you\u2019re... you\u2019re not like anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cI should hope not,\u201d Spock found himself saying. That was a curious experience. All Spock had strained to attain in his life had revolved around integration into the Vulcan culture. Of course, joining Starfleet had not supported his goal; but it had been the one selfish act in Spock\u2019s lifetime, and worth the consequences.\nNow, sitting beside Jim, Spock did not feel the need to be anyone else but himself. It was novel and invigorating and terrifying.\n\u201cI must apologise for intruding on your privacy on that day,\u201d Spock added, almost as an afterthought.\nJim nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d His hand slipped atop Spock\u2019s knee. Jim leaned in, lashes lowered so Spock could only make out a sliver of electric blue. \u201cIt\u2019s fine \u2013 as long as you stay in my privacy from now on. Then you\u2019ll never have to intrude.\u201d\n\u201cLogical,\u201d Spock murmured, and cool, plush lips slid into place against his. Delicate tremors skipped across his skin. Jim\u2019s tongue tasted the seam of Spock\u2019s lips, softly tracing until Spock could only helplessly open to him. Jim sighed into Spock\u2019s mouth, and the sound went straight to his stomach.\nAnd then one angle was not enough. Spock needed to experiment - felt compelled to taste and sample Jim in every way his lips could offer. Spock\u2019s hands gravitated to Jim\u2019s face; smooth skin around the flushed shell of his ears. The rough scrape of stubble on the sharp jut of his chin. Soft, downy hair at his temples.\nSpock dislodged from Jim\u2019s tongue and whispered against his swollen lips, \u201cJim, let me in. Please.\u201d\nHe had not realised how strongly he desired \u2013 craved, wanted, needed \u2013 to know Jim\u2019s mind. The bare glimpse he had received so many months ago had only incensed his curiosity. Now, it devoured him. More than anything, Spock needed to know Jim Kirk.\nJim\u2019s gaze flickered with doubt. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\nSpock nodded dumbly, his thumb brushing away the uncharacteristic frown pulling at the corner of Jim\u2019s mouth. Jim hummed softy, tilting into Spock\u2019s palm; turning his head just enough to catch Spock\u2019s thumb with the edge of his teeth. The smooth, moist tip of Jim\u2019s tongue flicked at the pad of Spock\u2019s digit, followed by a delicate nip.\nDormant nerves flared beneath Spock\u2019s skin, his every finger feeling singed anew. In that same moment, Jim released his mind and Spock was hurled into the hearth. Caught in the wave of tangled desire and affection that cascaded off Jim\u2019s psyche, Spock tilted his head back and mutely gulped for air. A needy whimper seized Spock\u2019s throat as Jim lapped softly at his thumb.\nThis was not a mind meld, Spock realised as his fingertips dug into Jim\u2019s hairline. This was the unnatural force of Jim, a new element in himself. Jim was consciously projecting his mind, specifically saturating his emotions and painting Spock\u2019s body with them.\nSpock was hardly cognisant of his hands reaching around to fist in the shirt hairs at the nape of Jim\u2019s neck; not until the dull ache of freshly healed wounds protested deep in his joints. Spock found that he did not care in the least. Not with Jim swinging forward and straddling Spock\u2019s lap. Not when Jim\u2019s hips ground against Spock\u2019s erection in a low, lazy roll.\nCoherent thought was carried away when Jim leaned forward and rasped softly in his ear, \u201cWanna fuck you, Spock. Want you to fuck me. You have an idea of just how much now. But I can wait, if you need me to. I can try to stop.\u201d\nSpock\u2019s only reply was a snarl he had never heard from his mouth before, as he latched on to Jim\u2019s neck and sucked a bruise to life. Jim\u2019s cry of surprise only spurred him on. Spock reached for the hem of Jim\u2019s shirt but his fingers were batted away, with Jim murmuring, \u201cYour hands,\u201d and stripping them both of their tunics.\nSpock took a moment in the frenzy to admire Jim\u2019s partially nude form. Muscle rippled smoothly down his arms in bunching slopes and curves. A light curling of hair trailed down a flat stomach, his diaphragm heaving with each shallow breath. Spock spotted a dark freckle on Jim\u2019s chest and his restraint promptly burnt out.\nSilence fractured into what was definitely a giggle from Jim, as Spock picked up his negligible weight and flipped him on to the mattress. Spock coaxed Jim into silence with his mouth, although he could still feel the smile that Spock could not account for.\nThis was not akin to the few kisses he had shared with Nyota; not in the same solar system. There was nothing gentle or serious or poised about this experience.\nTongues lashed and curled against each other; tasting teeth and lips and all the smooth contours in between. An unspoken race ensued to strip each other of clothes and logic and breath. Clumsily explorative strokes and grabs and squeezes ignited fires on the skin and in the blood. The most fascinating aspect of them all was the laughter.\nJim yelped, glee and arousal tangled in the sound, when Spock grazed his teeth down one taut, pink nipple. He laughed in obvious delight when Spock put his strength to use, manoeuvring and tossing Jim around the bed as he saw fit. There was a curve to Jim\u2019s lips before they enthusiastically ravaged Spock\u2019s.\nRolling from Spock\u2019s grip, Jim playfully grappled with Spock until they were both sitting up. Jim situated himself on Spock\u2019s lap, straddling his thighs. Spock sucked in a calming breath when his aching erection grazed Jim\u2019s and rasped against the soft hairs at Jim\u2019s stomach.\nHead bowed, his damp air plastered to his temples, Jim sought out Spock\u2019s right hand by the wrist. Spock settled his free hand on Jim\u2019s waist, his thumb lightly caressing the smooth skin of his side. Jim met Spock\u2019s unsure gaze, his own eyes sparking with mirth. He brought up Spock\u2019s hand between them and placed a delicate kiss on Spock\u2019s pointer finger. Spock\u2019s blood began to simmer, his erection twitching against Jim\u2019s stomach with interest.\nJim\u2019s voice was a low gravel, with a whisper of amusement teasing his tone. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you? I figured you would.\u201d Jim kissed Spock\u2019s middle finger, the tip of his tongue caressing the pad for an instant. \u201cI\u2019d only ever heard rumours about Vulcan erogenous zones, even in med school. But it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure it out once you search for the signs.\u201d\nA kiss to Spock\u2019s ring finger. This time, with an edge of Jim\u2019s teeth catching the tip. Spock\u2019s jaw dropped, his face going hot and his skin boiling. Spock snapped his mouth shut before a whine could escape.\nJim grinned and dragged his bottom lip up the length of Spock\u2019s pinkie, his mouth suckling the end of his digit for a blistering second. Spock couldn\u2019t abort the quivering of his thighs beneath Jim\u2019s legs.\nJim brought Spock\u2019s palm to his lips, where every exhale, every word from his mouth released a burst of fire from his hand to his groin. \u201cThe moment I saw you I wanted to do this.\u201d\nSpock was certain a moan escaped as his other hand dragged down Jim\u2019s hip to stroke his lightly furred thigh.\n\u201cThere was something about the way you glared at me - all sharp lines and straight spine. But your eyes,\u201d Jim paused to stare meaningfully at Spock. A shiver of recognition skittered across Spock\u2019s skin. Jim smiled, but the intensity of his gaze did not fade.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very Human. They tell me that you don\u2019t want straight lines and perfection. You want to be touched.\u201d Jim licked a cool stripe from the thudding pulse at Spock\u2019s wrist to the tip of his middle finger. \u201cYou want to be shaped and bent and broken.\u201d\nJim swirled his tongue around the tips of each finger and decadently suckled each pad with an errant scrape of teeth. Every ministration had Spock\u2019s muscles coiling tighter, like a spring about to snap. Jim swallowed down the length of Spock\u2019s middle finger and came up with a wet pop. Spock\u2019s eyes nearly rolled to the back of his head.\n\u201cWanna know how I know?\u201d Jim gasped, as Spock\u2019s free hand slipped around to trace the dimples above his buttocks. Jim darted his tongue into the dip between his pinkie and ring finger. \u201c\u2019Cause I want it too. How about it, Spock?\u201d\nJim dropped Spock\u2019s hand and draped his muscled arms over Spock's shoulders. Jim scraped his teeth across the pulse at Spock\u2019s neck and then gravitated toward his ear. His breath was moist against the tip. \u201cDo you wanna bend me?\u201d\nSpock\u2019s reply consisted of banding his arms tightly around Jim\u2019s waist, and pulling him in to plunder his mouth. Jim\u2019s body went pliant, while his lips grew increasingly insistent. Spock huffed wetly into Jim\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou speak too often.\u201d\nA silent laugh caressed Spock\u2019s cheek. Jim\u2019s hips jerked, beginning a slow rut against Spock\u2019s aching erection. Bundles of nerves gathered and fizzled and popped between Spock\u2019s thighs, and he was distantly aware that if Jim continued sliding against him with such wanton abandonment that he would not last much longer. Having Jim\u2019s slick, toned body rocking atop his lap was more than Spock had ever imagined possible.\nSpock took him by the waist and chucked him back on the bed, ignoring the distant twinge in his hands. Jim\u2019s uninhibited groan as he was tossed around left Spock drunk and staggered and uncaring, but for one goal. He was engorged to the point of pain and his mind screamed for the solace of Jim\u2019s body. Spock dragged his attention to Jim\u2019s face, and the dark, hungry look he received was all the encouragement he required.\n\u201cDo you have \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIn med-kit.\u201d Jim appeared to be unable to form coherent sentences. Spock hoped he had hid his dazed smile when he turned, and laid on his stomach to reach for the kit. He had the tube of lubrication in his hands when a sharp bite to his posterior sent his thoughts scattering, and hands fumbling.\n\u201cJim,\u201d Spock choked out in alarm. Jim sunk his teeth in again and soothed the afflicted area with his tongue. Spock squeaked, desperately attempting to rein his reaction. He fumbled for the tube he had dropped once more and hastily flipped to meet Jim\u2019s wolfish grin.\n\u201cYou squeaked.\u201d\n\u201cJim.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you forg \u2013\u201d\nSpock slipped in a slick finger up to the first knuckle, and Jim\u2019s eyes crossed. Spock leaned forward, bit down on Jim\u2019s lower lip and pushed in the remainder of the way. The rush of pleasure that circulated between his tightly clamped finger, and the electricity Jim was projecting was utterly staggering. If Spock had any doubts that he was doing this incorrectly, Jim\u2019s emotions blatantly assured him otherwise.\nSpock hypothesis that the slow, deliberate minutes he took opening and spreading Jim would give his body time to recuperate was faulty. When his fingertips grazed Jim\u2019s prostate, Spock\u2019s world went technicolour. His body tightened and trembled in time with the spasm around his sensitive fingers and his erection throbbed anew against Jim\u2019s quivering thigh.\nIt had to be now, or Spock would truly go mad.\nBiting down on the inside of his cheek, Spock settled between Jim\u2019s thighs and made a single, shallow thrust that had Jim\u2019s hands clenching the sheets. It took the remaining scraps of Spock\u2019s sanity not to plunge right in to Jim\u2019s tight, welcoming depths and pound him into the mattress. But illogical as it was, it seemed like Jim had read his mind. With a hiss that trailed off in a deep growl, Jim encircled Spock\u2019s waist with his thighs and impaled himself in one deliberate stroke.\nSpock\u2019s mouth opened in shock, but no sound would render. Jim\u2019s lips were a soft, pink \u2018o\u2019, his damp chest heaving. Spock slapped his palms over the firm mounds of Jim\u2019s rear and lifted him up to drive in once, hard, down to the base.\nJim\u2019s back arched and flew off the bed, his arms flying up to fist in the pillow above his head. His eyes were thickly lashed slits as he looked to Spock. The corner of his lips twitched and he thrust his hips up slowly and invitingly. Spock felt a pressure grow deep and tight in his centre and Jim\u2019s long grinding motions were stretching his resolve very thin.\nThen Jim whispered ashal-veh, almost unintelligibly, and Spock felt his cage crumble. He leaned forward and folded Jim at the waist. Jim\u2019s hands flung up to yank at Spock\u2019s hair and pulled him down for a kiss that was more akin to the slashing of tongue to tongue. Spock pumped into Jim\u2019s slick entrance with increasing urgency, every primal instinct within him howling.\nEach thrust pushed a tiny desperate noise from Jim\u2019s throat; a cry that grew into unabashed moans as the slap of their hips thundered in Spock\u2019s ears like erratic heartbeats. Spock did not know the time, the day, or his full name as he pummelled Jim into the bed. All he could feel was Jim \u2013 Jim hurtling with him over that sharp bright zenith. Spock reached between them and flicked his thumb across the tight cluster of skin below Jim\u2019s head.\nAn explosion rippled through Spock the likes of which he was unable to comprehend. Jim bucked beneath him, nails and fingers branding Spock\u2019s shoulders and back; pulling Spock in a free-fall that he wished would never end. Jim\u2019s spasms and raw, throaty gasps rode Spock dry, until he was nothing more than a shivering mass that collapsed atop Jim.\nCalm was something that seeped in quietly; slowly cooling the skin and soothing the mind. After long moments of nuzzling each other\u2019s necks, Jim\u2019s fingertips glanced over Spock\u2019s ear.\n\u201cNote, Vulcans are denser than the average Human.\u201d\n\u201cAre you attempting to allude to a point, Jim?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re heavy. Get off me, fatty.\u201d\n\u201cI am certainly not overweight,\u201d Spock informed him with no heat. But he rolled off Jim, his arms coming around the man to pull him onto his chest. Jim made an mmm noise and shoved his face against Spock\u2019s armpit. Spock restrained a smile.\nJim\u2019s lips tickled the sensitive flesh of his arm when he spoke. \u201cEr, I forgot about your hands at some point. Sorry. You okay?\u201d\n\u201cI am not in pain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll put more salve on when I can feel my limbs.\u201d\n\u201cI would enjoy that.\u201d\nJim uttered a husky sound of agreement. His muffled voice perked up after a time. \u201cSo, are you gonna admit you like me, or what?\u201d\nSpock kissed Jim\u2019s hair. \u201cI like you, Jim.\u201d\n\u201cI like you too, Spock... Now, about next month\u2019s physical?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d"
