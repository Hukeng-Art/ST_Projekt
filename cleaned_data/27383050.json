    "summary": "<p>A waft of spice hit Ochako\u2019s nostrils and she reeled back in shock. She has faced down countless villains since coming to UA. She has been in battle and in hand to hand combat possibly a hundred times. She faced Overhaul\u2019s minions with support from her peers, but otherwise without outside help. But no villain with a terrifying quirk has ever struck her with more fear than quirkless Melissa shoveling curry made of peppers so deadly it killed an unprepared Pro Hero famous for his spice tolerance on live TV. Deku was still guzzling water directly from the sink, Tokoyami\u2019s quirk was crying in pain as he casually shoveled more into his mouth, and Melissa was handling the spice like a pro.</p>\n<p>Being biologically quirkless came more with an extra pinkie joint in the toes and a stunning lack of vestiges mutations. It came with smaller things, like extra teeth that did virtually nothing, exploding organs, and weird exposed nerves that weren't designed to feel pain.</p>\n<p>Or,</p>\n<p>Five time's Midoriya Izuku struggled with being biologically quirkless and one time it was a gift</p>",

    "text": "\nThere was no way to look at it and come to the same conclusion that Ochako did. Deku was Weird with a capital W. Grade A weirdness. Absolutely feral little man.\u00a0\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t mind of course. The delightful little bundle of energy kept her on her toes and was more than sweet enough to make up for his little oddities. But sometimes there was just something that Ochako couldn\u2019t chalk up or dismiss as her best friend\u2019s ecstatic personality. He was nervous as a tick on a dog but born with such an amazing quirk. With a quirk that powerful, no one should have ever even thought twice about bullying him if they wanted to end up halfway across town and accountable for seven broken bones. (Not necessarily their own, but that isn't something they had to know.) And yet in the few times he brought up his middle school years outside of the hell training he forced himself though, he always mentioned bullies.\n\n\nHe was jumpy in the most odd places. It took weeks of surprise hugs for him to stop jumping out from under her touch, and weeks more for him to stop stiffening. He still flinches when she yells just a bit too loud, stiffens under unexpected touch from Iida or Kirishima. Ochako would have written it off to a slightly rough childhood home but his mom was a soft spoken saint and his father was nowhere to be found.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, her friend was weird. And she adored him for that.\u00a0\n\n\nBut this was the next level.\n\n\n\u201cHow do they fit inside of your shoes?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDeku shrugged, peeling a sweaty sock off and chunking it at her face that she ducked with a bark of laughter before stuffing the offending foot into a slipper. Deku rolled his eyes, but the smile did not disappear from his face. \u201cI wear high tops.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis toes were long. Weirdly long. Green hair, long toes, jumpy demeanor. What else was he hiding? Organs that could explode along with his bones?\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t your toes get crowded?\u201d She laughed.\n\n\n\u201cI actually do have concerns about possible athlete\u2019s foot if your footwear is inadequate-\u201d Iida interrupted, then gasped because he accidentally cut Ochako off. Ochako waved off his apologetic bow. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do work out a lot, and athlete\u2019s foot is a valid concern I haven\u2019t thought of.\u201d Deku admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never had a problem with it before. The only time I ever got it was when me and Kacchan accidentally swapped shoes in middle-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey! Shut your mouth before I shut it for you!\u201d Bakugou exploded from the couch. His threat was neutralized because Aizawa\u2019s cat, Fork, was asleep on his lap. Everyone knows the laws of the universe. One could not get up if a cat fell asleep in your lap until the nap was properly completed.\u00a0 Even Bakugou must follow these rules.\n\n\n\u201cThat is good to hear!\u201d Iida pushed himself to his feet and then grabbed Ochako and Deku by the back of their shirt collars with a yelp from both of them. \u201cNow, we must go study for tomorrow's test! I expect zero distractions from the two of you, queries about feet be damned!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t step on Deku\u2019s weird ass toes on the way up!\u201d Bakugou called cheerfully from under Fork\u2019s hold. Deku flipped him the bird.\n\n\nIn her heart, Ochako was glad that Deku was able to reach such a comfortable relationship with his classmates. He didn\u2019t jump under Iida\u2019s unintentionally rough handling and took Bakugou\u2019s light teasing in a stride.\n\n\nBut that was in her heart. For now she was out for murder. Crimes must be paid in full.\n\n\n\n\nShe picked Fork up from Bakugou\u2019s lap.\u00a0 Fork yowled with indentation, Bakugou exploded in mourning for his lost space heater and her, Iida, and Deku ran up the stairs at top speed, Bakugou cursing them a thousand deaths behind them as Kirishima tried to pspsps Fork onto his lap.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re colorblind?\u201d Kirishima gasped.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJust red green colorblind!\u201d Deku raised his hands in reassurance, which did nothing to calm the entirety of the class and only made the class buzz louder. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to tell some things apart. Like apples.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat about my hair?\u201d Kamimari tugged on his own locks, practically shoving his hair into Deku\u2019s face. \u201cWhat color is my hair to you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can see colors, including yellow.\u201d Deku said. The barest hint of crossness seeped into his voice. \u201cIt just looks dimmer, apparently. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal, guys.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay Midoryia, what color am I?\u201d Mina spun around in front of Midoryia\u2019s desk, her skirt flowing out in her spinning. Deku smiled politely, if a bit forced.\n\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re pink, Mina. Your hero name is literally Pinky.\u201d Deku rolled his eyes, and his smile appeared much more forced. \u201cI can see pink too. It's just not as vivid as you might see pink.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat is true, ribbit.\u201d Tsuyu chimed in. \u201cPlus, if Midoriya has been colorblind his whole life, to him colors are normal. They just may be harder to tell apart. He has no point of reference to know what some colors are supposed to look like. It's not that he doesn\u2019t know what colors are, some just look more similar. Ribbit.\u201d\n\n\nDeku\u2019s face relaxed. \u201cThank you, Asui. That\u2019s exactly how it is for me. I know the concept of green, it just looks similar to red. Sometimes red things are green!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCall me Tsuyu, ribbit.\u201d Tsuyu croaked happily. \u201cIt just bothers me when people use people's differences to entertain themselves.\u201d\n\n\nOchako nodded. She had listened when Tsuyu told her stories of her kindergarten, of how kids would pester her endlessly to do things with her quirk. Swallowing and spitting back up objects, sticking to walls.\n\n\n\u201cIt was all in good faith of course,\u201d She had croaked. In her lap was a small crocheted plushie of a frog, courtesy of her younger sister. \u201cBut it still hurt to be treated like an entertainer when I did not wish to be.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTsuyu sent a pointed glare at Mina, who gasped and raised her hands. \u201cAh, sorry Midoryia! I totally didn\u2019t think of that!\u201d\n\n\nDeku smiled, a much more relaxed and genuine smile then before. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I get it. It is different then what you\u2019re used to.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know, this is why traffic lights are situated so the colors align on all intersections,\u201d Momo pointed out. \u201cColorblindness used to be very common among quirkless individuals. It is just one of society\u2019s leftovers from simpler times.\u201d\n\n\nDeku\u2019s smile tightened. His shoulders shrunk into themselves. Bakugou stiffed, but continued to ignore the conversation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHaha, thats funny. Me. Quirkless.\u201d He said nervousness. \u201cI uh. I\u2019m just colorblind. Not quirkless. Not at all!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou\u2019s head hit the desk with a loud smack.\n\n\nIida frowned. \u201cNobody implied that you are quirkless, Midoryia. In the society of quirks, everyone everywhere has quirks that can both act as abilities or disabilities. Yours just so happens to be colorblindness as a drawback to, if I may be frank, crazy supernatural strength.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget his precious cracker bones!\u201d\n\n\nMomo nodded. \u201cI just thought it was interesting. I didn\u2019t mean any offense!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone taken!\u201d Deku\u2019s voice reached high pitches that even Present Mic might have difficulty reaching. Bakugou whirled around and shoved a small explosion into Deku\u2019s desk, which luckily had been cleared of any important papers.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGod! Do you ever shut up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you alright, Midoriya?\u201d Kirishima asked the next day over breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019ve been rubbing your jaw all morning.\u201d\n\n\nMidoryia\u2019s plate was piled high with untouched white rice, and nothing else.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy wisdom teeth are coming in,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to get them pulled next week but for now they\u2019re just really sore.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis what?\n\n\n\nHe offered no further context and Kirishima seemed too shocked to ask about the removal of \n\nteeth\n\n from Midoriya's \n\nmouth.\n\n\n\nThe following Monday Deku was gone from class, having been picked up by his mother early that morning. By the time class ended and Ochako had used up her allotted after school time training, she just walked into the dorms as Inko was dragging her son with her quirk, twenty feet in the air, with ice packs tied to his face with purple medical tape.\n\n\n\u201cMs Uraraka! Oh, can you get the door for me sweetie?\u201d Inko smiled in lieu of a greeting. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I need my hands empty to keep him afloat.\u201d\n\n\nOchako nodded, and let Inko into the dorms. Deku murmured something about clouds.\n\n\n\u201cI thought your quirk was making small objects float?\u201d Ochako asked, weakly. Small objects like paper clips and All Might figurines, according to Deku. Not full teenage boys with strong ropey muscles, extra bones, and a thick skull.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI am a small object.\u201d Deku said from the ceiling. His voice was slurred and muffled from the two ice packs strapped to his face. Apparently he was lucid enough to understand Ochako. He giggled. \u201cI am verrrry little.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, funny story!\u201d Inko laughed. \u201cI started using my quirk on him when he was a baby, and as he grew my quirk got stronger. It\u2019s amazing what exercising your quirk can do! Carrying a two kilogram newborn used to be my full strength.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTwo kilograms? That\u2019s way too small! Ochako looked at the thick teenager who was now picking at the ice packs on his mouth while mumbling something about a good dentist stealing his teeth. Ochako had seen Deku destroy buildings, had seen his quirk tear apart his very limbs because of the raw power flowing in his veins. In her mind, Deku has always been this powerful engingma of a kid who has always given his all. She cannot imagine Deku being a tiny two kilogram baby. Was he born premature? Would that explain all of his weird little minor health issues? No, prematureness doesn\u2019t give you extra bones or weird long toes. Being born premature doesn\u2019t give you crazy strong super strength that was powerful enough to punch a skyscraper tall robot into oblivion.\u00a0\n\n\nInko turned to Iida. \u201cClass President, can you guide me to Izuku\u2019s room? Once he takes a good nap he will be back to normal, so I\u2019ll just drop him off there for now.\u201d\n\n\nIida pushed his glasses to the bridge of his nose. \u201cOf course, Ms Midoriya!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Inko smiled a familiar smile. Ochako had seen that slightly bashful grin several times on her best friend. Seeing it on his mother's face was delightful!\u00a0\n\n\nInko made several pulling motions with her hands and Deku slowly made his way down from the ceiling. His arms wrapped around his mother\u2019s neck.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHi mom!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHello, sweetie!\u201d Inko laughed as she guided a still floating Deku to the stairs. \u201cAre you ready to take a nap?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFUCK YEAH!\u201d Deku whooped. Sero fell off of the armchair with his shout. Iida jumped so high he hit his head on the doorframe. Inko let out a laugh deep from her belly that Ochako distantly thought sounded like bells.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMom, there\u2019s something in my mouth,\u201d Deku stuck one scarred finger in his mouth, before Inko pulled his hand away with a flick of her finger. \u201cMom. Mom. Mom there\u2019s something in my mouth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gauze, sweetie.\u201d Inko laughed as Iida pressed the button for Deku\u2019s floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s in my mouth?\u201d Deku\u2019s eyes widened with the telltale sign of tears before exploding into a waterfall. \u201cMom! Tell god to stay out of my mouth!\u201d\n\n\nInko soon left after approximately fifteen minutes of reassurance from Aizawa and the rest of class 1A would look after Deku after he woke up. Inko had to go to work and was reluctant to do so, but Mina finally charmed her into leaving when she promised she would hand deliver any pudding to Deku himself. In the meantime, Ochako\u2019s phone was spammed with text messages of random emojis from Deku, most of them miscellaneous heart emojis.\u00a0\n\n\nThe chaos finally died down a few hours after Inko left and the elevator opened to reveal Iida, with a very out of it Deku clinging to his side.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Deku\u2019s awake.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDeku waved as he leaned heavily into Iida, who stopped every once in a while to straighten Deku back up. After a long trek from the elevator to the sofa, Deku finally was plopped into place between Ochako and Tsuyu. Iida smiled apologetically.\n\n\n\u201cHe wanted to watch the news but his phone was left unplugged. It died.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018\u2019Uck yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I got your messages.\u201d Ochako held up her phone, which was just a wall of random emojis and the occasional \u201cI LOBE USO FUKCIN MUCH\u201d text message. Deku sent her a thumbs up before careening into the side of the sofa. Iida picked him up by the shirt collar and threw him onto the couch. \u201cI was the last person he texted before he went under, so I was at the top of his recents list and therefore subject to his innermost thoughts and feelings.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get Inko\u2019s pudding!\u201d Mina sang as she skipped into the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDoes that sound good, Midoriya? Your mom made pudding. Ribbit.\u201d\n\n\nDeku nodded once, before falling into Tsuyu\u2019s lap. She pushed him back up again as Mina handed him a bowl of chocolate pudding.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling, nerd?\u201d Bakugou asked, almost softly if it wasn\u2019t for the disgusted look on his face. \u201cAre the holes in your mouth fixed yet?\u201d\n\n\nDeku opened his mouth in a face splitting grin. A mouthful of blood dripped down his chin and onto his shirt. \u201cYou will die in seven days, Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMIDORIYA, I MUST ASK YOU TO REFRAIN-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cHOLY FUCK GUYS HE\u2019S BLEEDING!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that much blood really okay-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cAll Might\u2019s secret lovechild-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cNooo, the pudding! Midoriya, you\u2019re getting blood in the pudding!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho cares about the pudding! Get the shirt off of him and into the sink before it stains!\u201d\n\n\nSero ripped Deku\u2019s shirt off and ran as fast as he could to the laundry room. Deku\u2019s shirt was immediately replaced by a thick blanket from the back of the couch.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, change of plans,\u201d Iida rubbed his forefinger and thumb between the bridge of his nose. \u201cTodoroki,\u201d He handed Todoroki two thick ice packs that Ochako recognized as the ones that were strapped to Deku\u2019s face a few hours before. \u201cRefreeze these, but not to a block of ice. About negative three degrees celsius, please!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki took the ice packs into his right hand and concentrated. A small curl of frost condensated on the back of his hand. He was probably going slow so he wouldn\u2019t freeze the packs into a block of ice. Last time he tried to cool something too quickly he ended up leaving the hard boiled eggs in an unmeltable block of ice for a week.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAsido, you were in charge of the pudding distribution, correct?\u201d Mina nodded. \u201cThen please go fetch another bowl. Yaoyorozu? If it is no trouble, please make Midoriya another shirt. Bakugou? Leave.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t going anywhere!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLeave before Midoriya tries to-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSEVEN DAYS!\u201d a new waterfall of blood erupted from Deku\u2019s mouth, dripping from his chin.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShit! That\u2019s Jirou\u2019s blanket!\u201d Sero groaned, before ripping the blanket out of Deku\u2019s hands to add it to the laundry. The blanket was dark enough, in Ochako\u2019s opinion, that any bloodstains wouldn\u2019t show anyway, but she supposed washing it was the nicest thing to do in this situation.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re done,\u201d Todoroki calmly said in the face of chaos, holding up the ice packs like the head of medusa. \u201cDo you have medical tape to put them on Midoriya\u2019s face again?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThey turned to Momo. She looked exhausted. She had used a lot of her lipids to make no less than three cannons in training earlier that morning, and was clearly still recovering from it. A simple tee shirt was the last of her strength.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMina? Get another bowl of pudding for Yaomomo, please!\u201d Ochako called into the kitchen. Mina gave a thumbs up. Momo sent a look of exhausted thanks from her spot on the sofa.\n\n\n\u201cWha\u2019 bout Sero?\u201d Deku mumbled. \u201cTape guy.\u201d\n\n\nIida and Ochako stared at each other over Deku\u2019s head. Tsuyu petted Deku\u2019s hair like a cat when he fell into her lap again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow did we not think of that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are idiots.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBakugou stood up from the couch and slammed the door to the laundry room behind him. A girly scream sounded out, and a moment later Bakugou kicked the sliding door open with a handful of tape in his hands. He grabbed the ice packs from Todoroki\u2019s delicate hands and slammed them to both sides of Deku\u2019s face. He looked like an idiot sandwich. Ochako reached out to keep them in place as Bakugou tied the tape around Deku\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cCan I reschedule my death now?\u201d Bakugou let go of Deku\u2019s face. He hit Tsuyu\u2019s shoulder on the way down, and she croaked out a startled \u201cRibbit!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe eight days.\u201d Deku mumbled.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBetter.\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes, grinning.\n\n\n\u201cAre you like, okay?\u201d Ochako spoke over a mouthful of rice. She gestured with her chopsticks to Deku\u2019s entire body. He sent a weak glare in her direction, which did nothing to counteract how pale he looked or how hard he was sweating.\n\n\n\u201cI just have a stomach ache.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt looks like more than a stomach ache,\u201d Iida shot back. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone completely flushed and you hunched over the last lesson.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad stomach ache,\u201d He argued. \u201cIt\u2019s like a jabbing pain instead of like, waves?\u201d He gestures to the side of his torso, trying to hide his gritted teeth behind a pained smile.\u00a0\n\n\nOchako put a hand to Deku\u2019s face, and felt the blood drain out of her face. He was burning up. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are like, on fire,\u201d she so eloquently and dumbfoundly said instead. Iida and Tsuyu both put their hands on Deku\u2019s face as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI would like to take a nap on your forehead please?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a concern. Perhaps we should take you to Recovery Girl after all?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Deku waved off Iida\u2019s hands and tried to unstick Tsuyu\u2019s from his face and proceeded to accidentally rip away part of his eyebrow in the process. \u201cStop touching me. Tsuyu give me back my eyebrow. If I still feel bad after lunch I\u2019ll go, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFineeeee,\u201d Ochako whined. Iida force fed Deku some curry broth with only meek protests from Deku.\n\n\nTurns out they didn\u2019t have to wait until lunch was over.\n\n\nDeku reached across the table to grab his water bottle just as Kanimari and Kirishima were in the middle of an impromptu wrestling match over the last piece of chocolate Mina had brought from home. Kanimari threw Kirishima into their table by accident, knocking Deku and Ochako off their seats.\n\n\nEverything moved much more quickly after that.\n\n\nKirishima let out a sheepish apology right as he elbowed Deku in the stomach and Deku \n\nscreamed.\n\n It was cut off by a gurgle as Deku vomited all over himself and Ochako. Kirihima let out a yelp. \nWithout a second of hesitation, working together like so many times before, Ochako activated her quirk on Deku as Iida leapt over the table, sending a few dishes flying to the floor, scooping Deku up into his arms and racing out of the room at top speed, with Ochako, Kirishima, and Tsuyu close on his heels.\n\n\nRecovery Girl took one look at a vomit-covered Deku and shooed them all out of the room, saying something about appendicitis and surgery.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then they were alone, outside of the nurses office. Waiting. Aizawa would probably come looking for them when they didn\u2019t show for afternoon training. Ochako left at one point to go clean her vomit covered shirt with Tsuyu and came back to Iida and Kirishima shouting.\n\n\n\u201cKirishima, it isn\u2019t your fault at all. In fact, if you didn\u2019t hit Midoriya we might not even noticed the severity of the situation.\u201d Iida pushed his glasses further up on his nose. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut still!\u201d Kirishima protested. \u201cI hurt him! He was already in a lot of pain and I made it worse!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were going to take him to Recovery Girl afterwards anyway,\u201d Ochako cut in. \u201cHe was like, really sick. Honestly you did us a favor, since we didn\u2019t know it was this bad.\u201d\n\n\nKirishima lowered his head. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling bad though.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAizawa eventually found them and dragged them back to class, but didn\u2019t say a word against them.\n\n\nWhen Midoriya was brought back to the dorms later that day, a little pale but with a shaky bright smile upon his face, the air seemed to let out whatever breath it was holding.\n\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d \n\n\n\n\nIt happened in an instant. Deku and Satou were doing basic sparing exercises. Satou had tackled Deku, tossed him over his shoulder like a fireman\u2019s carry, and had slammed him into the ground. Ochako was keeping half an eye on him in case another appendix incident happened but also so she could practice the hand to hand combat moves later. Satou had been extremely careful to make sure Deku hit the mat back first, not the head. He was also carefully avoiding Deku\u2019s lower right torso where the appendix was removed. But now Deku was clutching his elbow and rubbing his forearm vigorously. She stopped in shock. Sero crashed into her and they tumbled to the ground.\n\n\n\u201cWhat gives?\u201d He groaned, before helping her untangle tape from her hair.\n\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Deku.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAw fuck,\u201d Sero sighed. He still had not forgiven Deku for making him fall off his armchair. They quickly shuffled to Deku and Satou\u2019s mat, fully prepared for any emergency involving exploding organs and/or the removal of teeth.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, sorry, you hit my funny bone on the way down. It just takes a minute to stop hurting!\u201d Deku reassured Satou\u2019s growing concern.\n\n\nThis only made Satou\u2019s expression twist into something more worrisome. \u201cFunny bone?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDeku blinked. \u201cYeah. You know, a funny bone? The ulnar nerve?\u201d\n\n\nOchako had \n\nno \n\nidea what he was talking about. Satou shuffled his hands nervously. It was an interesting expression on such a big guy that almost reminded her of Gunhead. \u201cUm. maybe we should just take you to Recovery Girl. This sounds serious. I don\u2019t want you to have nerve damage or something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not serious at all!\u201d Deku waved him off. The aforementioned hand was now being shaken vigorously in an almost stim-like movement. Ochako looked around wildly for Bakugou, hoping that he had some sort of childhood friend explanation for this new strange phenomenon. \u201cIt just happens sometimes. Actually, hold on,\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDeku pulled his phone out of his pocket and began to type with one hand. Aizawa had finally noticed the small gathering of students and their concerned expressions and meangered forward.\n\n\n\u201cProblem child, no phones in class.\u201d He chided with a glare. Bakugou finally noticed what was going on and, to Ochako\u2019s horror, just began laughing as Deku rubbed his arm against his thigh.\n\n\n\u201cJust a second, sir! I\u2019m trying to reassure Satou that I\u2019m fine!\u201d \n\n\n\n\nAizawa\u2019s glare narrowed. \u201cWhat happened.\u201d\n\n\nNot even phrased like a question. Harsh.\n\n\n\n\nDeku laughed awkwardly. \u201cI feel like my hand is being burned, frozen and electrocuted at the same time?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBakugou was now laughing so hard that tears were streaming down his face.\n\n\nIida whirled around at Kamimari and Todoroki, who were paired up for the exercise. \u201cStop using your quirks on Midoriya this instant! It is unbecoming to do low tricks like this, and seeing that you two were not even paired up with him-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not their fault!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing anything!\u201d Kamimari screeched.\u00a0\n\n\nTodoroki blinked like a cat. \u201cI am just sitting here.\u201d\n\n\nThis only caused Bakugou to fall to the floor, chest shaking as he struggled to catch his breath. A small puddle of tears formed on the cement. His laughter was horrible. It sounded like a dog choking on a bone. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ochako realized that this was the first time she had ever seen Bakugou laugh. She prayed she would never have to hear it again.\n\n\nAizawa rubbed his forehead with his pointer finger and thumb. Deku shoved his phone into his hands and Aizawa carefully began to read the page he pulled up.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, this nerve shouldn\u2019t be exposed.\u201d Aizawa pointed out. \u201cIt also shouldn\u2019t even feel pain. It\u2019s just supposed to make two fingers on your hand move.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nDeku vibrated with nervous energy. If he vibrated any faster, he would move faster than the speed of light and be able to walk through walls. \u201cHahahahahahaha. \n\nHa\n\n. Uh, funny story-\u201d\n\n\nBakugou finally regained some composure and forced himself up. Small explosions sparked from his hands as he let out the occasional giggle. \u201cHe fucked up his arms so much that he- \n\nha- \n\nhe has it exposed now. IT\u2019S BEEN- \n\nholy Shit-\n\n It\u2019s been fucked up since we were kids.\u201d Bakugou barely sputtered out before continuing his horrifying laugh.\n\n\nOchako couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She jumped across the mat, releasing her quirk at the last possible second to tackle Deku in a bear hug that almost knocked him over.\n\n\n\u201cWhy does your body hate you?!\u201d She sobbed into his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop crying, you two.\u201d Aizawa looked like he would rather be anywhere but here. \u201cMidoriya, you say it\u2019ll wear off in a few minutes? Go sit down until the pain is \n\ncompletely\n\n gone. Bakugou, stop laughing, you\u2019re scaring Kamimari.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMelissa!\u201d Deku jumped to his feet, knocking his pile of books off of the table as he did so and crashed into his friend with a bone crushing hug. \u201cOh god, it\u2019s been forever!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIzuku! It\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d Melissa grinned. Her american accent was just as thick as Ochako remembered, and was delightful to hear. \u201cI brought a new batch, just like you requested.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Deku fist pumped so wildly he almost elbowed Hagakure in the face. \u201cOh thank goodness. I haven\u2019t been able to buy any since-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cSince the Pro Hero SpiceBomb Incident.\u201d Melissa and Deku said at the same time, before laughing. To anybody listening closely, their laughter would sound just on the wrong end of maninical. To anyone casually onlooking, it just sounded like two friends reunited. Until Melissa whipped out a sealed biohazard bag with a tub of what looked to be ordinary curry.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you have a spare microwave for this? I don\u2019t want to accidentally contaminate anybody else\u2019s food like last time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened last time?\u201d Ochako followed the pair to the kitchen, curiously. Nervously. Anxiously. Melissa, Deku\u2019s cousin, was a strange oddity that she had only met a few times outside of I-Island and any moment with her was entertaining. She reminded Ochako of a much more rational minded Mei Hatsume, and mentally noted to never put the two of them in the same room. The biohazard bag stared at her ominously.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI accidentally caused three quirked kids to get rashes on their faces when they cooked their instant ramen after I heated up my curry without a proper lid.\u201d Melissa answered with her thick american accent and the casual swoop of a hand.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s right! Melissa was quirkless. But that still didn\u2019t explain the biohazard bag. Ochako looked around desperately for an explanation, and got only a shrug from Deku.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m immune.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cImmune to what?\u201d Tokoyami asked from on top of the fridge, causing them all to jump. His eyes widened.\n\n\n\u201cDo not tell me\u2026 Is that the curry of the fruit of the Forbidden? The one said to bring pain to one's eyes just by glancing at it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you mean Carolina Reapers, then yes?\u201d Melissa answered with a bright smile.\u00a0\n\n\nTokoyami awkwardly situated himself off of the fridge, before bowing deeply. \u201cMs Shield, I would be forever in your debt if you allow me a taste. I have not had so much a flake of flavor since the-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cThe Pro Hero SpiceBomb Incident?\u201d They all three said at once. Tokoyami nodded sadly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019ve had ghost peppers before?\u201d Deku asked. \u201cHow? They kill anyone who isn't genetically-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am bird.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes capsaicin not affect you? But that implies that not only does your bird biology affect your taste buds, but also that your body is equipped to deal with the-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are Carolina Reapers?\u201d Ochako carefully inquired. She felt like she was imposing on some sort of sacred ritual. Maybe if she left now, she could keep whatever shred of dignity and preservation she had left. She carefully took a side step away from the biohazard bag.\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Bakugou finally seemed to hear what they were talking about and finally exploded into the kitchen, knocking the table into the ceiling with a stray firecracker palm. \u201cWE AGREED! ITS CHEATING!\u201d\n\n\nDeku crossed his arms. \u201cYou said it was cheating. I never agreed to nothin\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAgain, I have to ask, what are Carolina Reapers?\u201d She asked Tokoyami, since Melissa was vibrating with excitement watching the curry circle in the microwave and Deku was currently being thrown into the kitchen cabinets.\u00a0\n\n\nTokoyami took her hands into his own while Deku and Bakugou exploded. \u201cBeware, Ms Uraraka. Fruit of the Forbidden Spice is not one for the casual. For the fated ghost peppers can kill a man if eaten unprepared.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre you telling me that THIS curry-\u201c Ochako pointed to the bag. Bakugou body slammed Deku into the table and accidentally broke three plates while doing so. \u201cIs made out of peppers so hot it has killed people?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt killed pro Hero SpiceBomb on live TV because he was foolishly unprepared.\u201d Tokoyami nodded.\n\n\nShe shook her head, horrified. Deku threw Bakugou into the refrigerator. \u201cWhy on earth would you even eat that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause me and Izuku are immune!\u201d Melissa sang happily as she unwrapped the fated biohazard bag and stuck the inconspicuous tubberware into the microwave. She didn\u2019t pop the lid. \u201cAnd Tokoyami is a bird, so he shall receive a portion as well!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI shall forever be in your debt, Dear Melissa.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYasee-\u201c Deku began, before Bakugou released another string of explosions in his face. \u201cYou see, ol\u2019 Kacchan here-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cDo NOT \u2018Kacchan\u2019 me you dirty piece of shit cheater-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cCANNOT beat me in a spice off for this very reason.\u201d Deku said proudly. \u201cBecause MY stomach is actually equipped to handle-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cTHE HOTTEST PEPPERS IN THE WORLD!\u201d Deku used Bakugou as a battering ram against the kitchen door. Drywall fell to the floor as Bakugou released another string of explosions with an undignified yell, and Ochako made a mental note to leave an anonymous tip for Cementos to fix later.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMICROWAVE COMPLETE!\u201d\n\n\nTokoyami, Deku, and Melissa ascended on the tubberware like vultures to a carcass. Tokoyami didn\u2019t even use a spoon, and just dug his face in like a bird pecking at the ground. Ochako could only look on, horrified. Bakugou glared at them from the ground.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Deku cried.\n\n\n\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\u201d Melissa fanned her face. \u201cGod, I am dying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder this is a banned substance in 34 countries.\u201d Deku sobbed. \u201cThis is truly the worst experience of my life. What else is in this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStar Anise,\u201d Melissa coughed. \u201cFellow quirkless friend said it helped bring out the spice more because after a few seconds-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cOh noooooo,\u201d Deku fell to the floor. \u201cOh I taste it now. It is somehow worse than before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt requires hot sauce.\u201d Tokoyami remarked. A single tear fell from his eyes. From under his shirt, Dark Shadow screamed in agony.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDirty cheater.\u201d Bakugou scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for cheating.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKacchan, eating spicy food is supposed to be a pleasant experience,\u201d Deku wailed. \u201cI would only wish this fate upon Overhaul himself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPleasant?\u201d Ochako whispered to herself. Her spice tolerance was average. She would never consider spicy food pleasant, even if she ate nothing but.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet you eat it happily without even preparing a cup of water beforehand,\u201d Bakugou spat. Deku was now twisting his body so he could pour water from the sink directly into his open mouth, and at least had the dignity to look guilty.\u00a0\n\n\nA waft of spice hit Ochako\u2019s nostrils and she reeled back in shock. She has faced down countless villains since coming to UA. She has been in battle and in hand to hand combat possibly a hundred times. She faced Overhaul\u2019s minions with support from her peers and classmates, but otherwise without outside help. But no villain with a terrifying quirk has ever struck her with more fear than quirkless Melissa shoveling curry made of peppers so deadly it killed an unprepared Pro Hero famous for his spice tolerance on live TV. Deku was still guzzling water directly from the sink, Tokoyami\u2019s quirk was crying in pain as he casually shoveled more into his mouth, and Melissa was handling the spice like a pro.\n\n\n\u201cHow on earth is this pleasant?\u201d\n"
