He certainly never would have gone to the Bakugou\u2019s if he knew\u2026Or well, maybe he would have, because Midoriya was desperate, and slightly scared. Which was something he hated to admit to, as a pro hero in training, but it was true. </p>\n<p>Or, the one in which Midoriya Hisashi returns and scares Izuku into seeking help from the Bakugou\u2019s. Luckily the Bakusquad are there to help though, and of course tease Katsuki\u2019s for his complete personality shift.</p>",

    "text": "Outside, the rain was flowing in a heavy downpour, the wind billowing so harshly it shook the apartment building. Every sane person had taken shelter from the weather late into the afternoon. The clock read 6 00PM. Bakugou Masaru sat on the living room couch, reading the daily newspaper. He was actively ignoring the sound of teenage boys screaming and some minor explosions coming from upstairs. By now the man considered himself a master of selective hearing. \nBakugou Mitsuki was in the kitchen cooking her son and his three friend\u2019s dinner. Every move she made was done with harsh, erratic movements. She slammed the saucepan onto the kitchen top, threw the wooden spoon against the sides as she stirred, muttered dangerously as she worked. \n\u201cI mean the brat didn\u2019t even tell us they were coming over!\u201d She barked at her husband, who hummed at his wife\u2019s rambling. \u201cHe could have at least mentioned it! Three friends! Then I would have at least known to make dinner!\u201d\nEvery word was said with a shrill growl. \nMasaru merely nodded, thinking over the entrance of his son\u2019s friends. He had known, from the very minute they had knocked on their door, that Katsuki had no idea they were popping by, let alone staying the night at the Bakugou\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOpen the door, damn brat!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already doing that, hag!\u201d Katsuki slammed the door open.\n\u201cBakugou!\u201d A young redheaded boy yelled as his son opened the door.\nKatsuki slammed it shut. \n\u201cKatsuki! Don\u2019t be fucking rude!\u201d\n\u201cShut it, you old hag! It's none of your business.\u201d\nThe two devolved into their usual shouting match. Without a word, Masaru stood from the couch and made his way to the door which was still being knocked on persistently. When he opened it, Masaru was faced with three teenage boys, one with red hair, another yellow, and the other black. \n\u201cGood Afternoon, sir,\u201d the three boys bowed. \nEach carried a bag and pillow, and were dressed in dripping raincoats. \n\u201cGood afternoon boys,\u201d Masaru replied, ignoring the shouting match still going on inside the apartment. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d\n\u201cWe hope you don\u2019t mind sir, but we are here for a sleepover with Bakugou,\u201d the red-haired one said, rubbing the back of his neck with his free hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Bakugou told you all about it, sir!\u201d The yellow haired once chimed in.\n\u201cWhat did you say Dunce-face?\u201d His son bellowed, cutting off the argument with his mother. \n\u201cNot a word, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Masaru said politely, as though his son hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cBut don\u2019t let that stop you. Come on in boys.\u201d \nHe opened the door and the three friends trickled in, taking care to remove their shoes as they entered the threshold. \n\u201cI\u2019m Kirishima Eijiro,\u201d the red-haired boy bowed deeply, his backpack sliding off his shoulder slightly. \n\u201cAh, yes, I believe Katsuki has mentioned you before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t!\u201d his son bellowed. A deep red was settling over his cheeks, and he turned his head to hide the blooming blush.\nHis black-haired friend snickered, before clearing his throat.\n \u201cSero Hanta, sir.\u201d\n\u201cKaminari Denki!\u201d the yellow boy cheered.\n\u201cWonderful to meet you all boys,\u201d Masaru nodded to each. \u201cI saw you all compete at the sports festival. I have to say you all did remarkably well.\u201d\nThey all chimed in with their thanks, decidedly ignoring Katsuki growling behind them. \n\u201cKatsuki, why don\u2019t you give the boy\u2019s a tour of the house. Also, be sure to set up the spare futons so they have something to sleep on tonight.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT? I don\u2019t even want them here!\u201d \n\u201cBrat! That is no way to talk to your guests!\u201d\n\u201cAGH! Whatever HAG!\u201d\nAnd so, the boys had taken off, his son stomping away as his friends snickered behind him. \n\u00a0\nNow, listening to his son threaten his friends upstairs, and his wife banging around in the kitchen, Masaru shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to hear another knock at the Bakugou\u2019s front door. Sure, the fact that his son had three friends wanting to stay over was a shock. He would admit to thinking another would be an anomaly. Still, they were teenagers, and it was customary for them to have big sleepovers. He was sure. \nQuickly folding his newspaper in half, the Bakugou elder made his way to the door, opening it fully to greet whichever friends had come. \n\u201cIzuku?\" \nTo say it had been awhile since Masaru had seen his son\u2019s childhood friend was an understatement. Midoriya Izuku had not been to the Bakugou\u2019s home since before the boys entered middle school. The man knew that was likely because of his son\u2019s behavior, even if neither boy would admit to it, but still, to see the him here was quite a shock. \n\u201cAre you here for the sleepover as well? Come in, come in!\u201d\nThe man was so quick to usher the small, shivering boy in, he didn\u2019t notice the look of confusion cross Midoriya\u2019s face. In fact, if he had of taken the time to properly look, he would have known Izuku Midoriya was decidedly not here for a sleepover.\nMidoriya was soaked. The rain from outside had drenched through the thin clothes he wore, letting the shrill wind cut right straight to his pale skin. This was caused him to shake with thick, full body shudders. The rain concealed but didn\u2019t hide the thick tear stains marring the boy\u2019s face and Masaru knew immediately the shudder of his bottom lip was not from the cold. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Masaru light toned dropped, suddenly serious and stern.\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s lip wobbled further. \u201cI d-didn\u2019t know where else t-to go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nMidoriya head hung as he studied his red, waterlogged sneakers. Water was dripping from his hair. It was soaking into the Bakugou\u2019s white carpet, leaving a dark, muddy stain. He stood there shaking, trying to tell the man in front of him what was wrong, his stuttering breath betraying him. In the end, all he could manage was four whispered words. \n\u201cMy Dad came home.\u201d\nThe kind concerned face Bakugou Masaru expressed completely dropped. His eyes went wide, his mouth pressed thin. In the kitchen, his wife continued ranting about her son\u2019s behavior. \n\u201cMitsuki,\u201d he called out. When she continued monologuing, Masaru raised his voice, letting a firm, sharp shout. \u201cMitsuki!\u201d\nInstantly, his wife stilled. She turned around slowly, a deadly expression on her face, ready to attack her husband for daring to take that tone with her. She paused though, when she saw her Husband at the door. Katsuki\u2019s childhood friend stood shaking and wet in the doorway, his green hair splattered to his face, clothes dripping on her expensive white carpet. She looked to her husband for an explanation, only to find him staring at her with the most serious expression he could muster. \n\u201cMitsuki,\u201d her husband didn\u2019t need to shout to have her attention now. His calm yet serious demeanor sent chills to her spine. \u201cHisashi is back.\u201d\nThe world stopped. For a short, tiny second, Mitsuki, the women who screamed at pro-heroes herself, froze. The moment that second was up however, she was in action. The pots on the oven slammed against each other as Mitsuki threw them off the hotplate and turned off the stove. She grabbed a cloth to wipe her hands and ran towards her husband. \nWithout hesitation, she reached out to Izuku, grabbing the boy and pushing him over to sit on the couch, uncaring of the wet stains he left. She then placed her hands on his cheeks and raised his head so she could make eye contact. \n\u201cIzuku, honey, listen to me. You need to stay here!\u201d\nThe fear in his eyes showed and Mitsuki felt her heart squeeze, like too much blood was flowing through her veins all at once. The young boy opened his mouth to protest. \n\u201cNo! You need to stay here. Masaru and I are going over to your house now. First, I need you to tell me, how long has Hisashi been home?\u201d\nShe was shouting at him, not unkindly, just loud. Urgent. She needed him to answer and fast. \n\u201cHe just got here,\u201d He whimpered. \u201cMum told me to stay in my room, but then I heard shouting and I knew I had to help, but she made me promise not to come out of my room and my door was locked! I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went out the window and ran here!\u201d\nFear rolled in Mitsuki\u2019s stomach like a snake twisting and coiling to prepare for an attack. \n\u201cHoney, you did exactly what you should have,\u201d Mitsuki felt her husband drape her red, designer raincoat over her shoulders. \u201cYou to stay here, Izuku. Promise me you won\u2019t leave!\u201d\nIt was a demand, a tone she often used with her own son with little results. Katsuki would merely roll his eyes and yell back his own demand. This was Izuku however, and the sharp, serious tone had always been much more effective on the quieter boy. With another wobble of his bottom lip, the boy nodded a single, teary eyed nod, and the slightest feeling of relief flooded Mitsuki\u2019s chest. \n\u201cWe need to go,\u201d Her husband moved to open the front door, his raincoat hanging over his arm. \u201cIzuku, we will call you as soon as we can, but for now stay here. I mean it.\u201d\nIn a normal situation, anyone would know the harsh, demanding tone of Masaru\u2019s voice was uncharacteristic for the quiet, mild-mannered man. However, this wasn\u2019t a normal situation. Without another word, the two parents rushed out the door, which left a resounding thud as it was shut behind them. \nMidoriya sat in the living room of the Bakugou\u2019s home, still dripping and shaking from the rain, unmoving apart from the shudders that rushed through his body. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy the hell are you idiots here?\u201d Bakugou scowled. \nHis arms were crossed as he sat on his bed, watching the three idiots that called themselves his friends set up futons on the floor of his room. \n\u201cWe wanted to see what your house looked like!\u201d Kaminari exclaimed, shaking out his sleeping bag. \u201cAnd we were like, what would really annoy Kaachan? A sleepover!\u201d\nKaminari ducked as Bakugou launched a small explosion his way. He grinned as it comfortably missed, sure it was a sign the explosive boy was only kidding. \n\u201cI thought it would be super manly to have a sleepover with our best mate,\u201d Kirishima chimed in. \u201cI know we all stay at the dorms now, but how often do we actually hangout for a sleepover? Never!\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Bakugou grumbled in agreement. \u201cAnd that\u2019s for a reason. I don\u2019t like any of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure you do,\u201d Kirishima responded. \nBakugou ground his teeth, a permanent scowl painted on his face. \n\u201cWhat about you, huh?!\u201d\n\u201cWho, me,\u201d Sero asked, looking around, obviously playing dumb. \u201cAnd miss this train wreck? Not a chance, mi amigo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill all of you.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Kirishima laughed. \u201cGood one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, haven\u2019t heard that before,\u201d Kaminari muttered. \n\u201cTch, whatever. Just shut up and make your beds already. After that you can entertain yourselves. The old hag will have dinner finished soon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thanks Bakubro!\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Kaminari fluffed his pillow. \u201cYou and your Mom are like crazy similar.\u201d\n\u201cYou take that back PIKACHU!\u201d Bakugou exploded. \n\u201cJeez, man, chill,\u201d Sero said, attempting to sound serious. The snicker he let out derailed that effort.\n\u201cYeah, man, I\u2019m just saying. I mean, I can hear her shouting right now, which totally explains why you are the way you are.\u201d\n\u201cWHY DO YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT\u2019S A BAD THING!\u201d\nExplosions sounded. Kaminari held his hands up in surrender and the three finished setting up, each taking turns to snicker at Bakugou\u2019s behavior. Bakugou\u2019s room was what you would expect of a typical teenage, if a little bare due to him mostly living at the dorms. His bed was pushed against the wall opposite the door, and it was lined up to face the small television. There was a small game console beside it, which the boys knew they would be taking advantage of later that night, but overall, nothing too embarrassing they could tease the other boy about. To say Kaminari and Sero were a little disappointed was an understatement. \nAfter a while of lounging around, Kaminari\u2019s stomach started to grumble, which quickly reminded the others that it was almost dinner time. \n\u201cHey, Bakubro, when did your Mom say dinner would be ready?\u201d\n\u201cTch, how would I know? She usually just screams until I come down.\u201d\nThe boys all paused, waiting to hear the shrill shouts of Mrs. Bakugou. Instead, they heard only silence. \n\u201cMaybe we should go and check?\u201d Kaminari\u2019s stomach gave another wail. \nBakugou merely rolled his eyes before standing up. \n\u201cWhatever, extras.\u201d\nMaking their way downstairs to the kitchen, the boys were surprised by how quite the house was. Even Bakugou looked uneasy, his shoulders tenser than usual. When they finally reached the bottom step, Kirishima tried to step into the main room, but was stopped by Bakugou shooting an arm out, pulling him back.\n\u201cBakugou?\u201d\nThe blonde was silent, eyes scanning the space of the room they could see. His friends noticed from his hard eyes and squared jaw; he was squaring up for an attack. Instantly the others were on high alert. Sero raised his arms, getting his tape ready, Kaminari charged up, and Kirishima hardened his skin. None knew why the blonde was on high alert, but they knew by now to trust his gut instinct. Without another word, Bakugou jumped from into room, setting off explosions, screaming.\n\u201cDIE!\u201d\nHe was met with utter silence. \nThe group of boys scanned the deserted room, confused at the absence of the Bakugou parents. Katsuki\u2019s eyes scanned over the kitchen, taking note of the mess his mother had left, something he had never known the woman to make in the past. Just as he was about to scream out for his mother, Kirishima spoke.\n\u201cMidoriya!\u201d\nBakugou whipped his head around, and sure enough, there sitting on his couch, looking utterly pathetic and shaking, was Deku. \n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here shitty nerd!\u201d He bellowed. \u201cNo way in hell are you staying over!\u201d\n\u201cHey man, that\u2019s not very nice,\u201d Kaminari muttered. \n\u201cLike I care! Which one of you idiots invited him here?\u201d He glared at the three boys, who all resoundingly shook their heads. \u201cTch, I bet you invited yourself over, shitty nerd. Get lost Deku!\u201d\nBakugou barely looked at Deku, too furious the other was in his home without his knowledge. \n\u201cUm, Bakugou,\u201d Kirishima whispered.\n\u201cWhat! He isn\u2019t staying!\u201d He said resolutely. \nBakugou turned to give the redhaired boy a stern look, only to see Kirishima\u2019s frowning, his face full of concern and worry. He snapped his head over to follow his friends gaze and found his eyes locked on Deku. \nDeku was wearing a thin blue shirt and black shorts that were completely soaked. His hair was matted to his face and his skin was pale, almost blue from the cold. He sat on the couch shivering violently as droplets of water dripped from his hair and clothes, dampening his skin further. The most concerning thing of all, however, was the way his gaze was locked on the front door, unwavering in its stare. \n\u201cDeku,\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice dropped to a normal level. It made no difference though, and Deku still acted as though he hadn\u2019t heard the other. \nTaking a few steps towards the other, Bakugou tried again. Worry was making his chest ache, like a boulder was crushing it, constricting his airways. Never had he seen the other boy look so defeated, and it pained him to admit, it scared him. His mind immediately went to potential villains attacking the boy. \n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Katsuki would deny his voice trembling over the unfamiliar name. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nMidoriya snapped out of his trance. Ever so slightly, his eyes slipped from the door, and towards his Kacchan. \n\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d Bakugou demanded again. Fear was racing through his veins, causing a cold sweat to break out over his skin. He made note to control his quirk with more care until he had a chance to wipe off the excess sweat. \nFinally, Midoriya looked at him with wide, bloodshot eyes, the sight hitting Bakugou like a blow to the chest. Slowly, the trembling boy opened his mouth to respond. \n\u201cMy D-Dad came back.\u201d\nBakugou rushed forward. His friends threw their arms out to stop him, aware that Midoriya was in no state to fight the clearly furious, red-faced Bakugou, but their attempts were futile. Ignoring the shouts of Kaminari and Sero, Bakugou reached the shivering boy in seconds, a look of thunder across his face. He stood in front of Midoriya, towering over him as he glared at his fragile form. \nThen, Bakugou did something that completely surprised, shocked, and somewhat frightened Kirishima, Kaminari and Sero. \nWith firm hands, he reached up and grabbed Midoriya\u2019s cheeks, rubbing his thumb against the cold, pale skin. Slowly, he raised the others face until green eyes met red. \n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he murmured. \nMidoriya shook his head, and simply closed his eyes. Bakugou knew this was all the answer he would get. Despite the other boy\u2019s annoying ability to mutter incessantly for hours, when things were really troubling him, he could turn scarcely silent. Without asking, Bakugou began scanning Midoriya\u2019s face, twisting his head so he could angle it better and view every inch of skin. When his face was deemed mark free, he shoved the other boys head down, grabbing the collar of his shirt so he could see his neck and back. \n\u201cKacchan, I\u2019m fine,\u201d the whispered words carried across the silent room. \nStill, Bakugou continued checking for injuries. Sides, stomach, arms, back and face again. Anything Midoriya\u2019s father may had access to grab or hit. When he finally deemed Midoriya to be bruise free, he moved his hands again, so they were placed on his plump, pale cheeks once more. \n\u201cTch! You idiot. How can you be fine? Your fucking freezing and your clothes are soaking wet.\u201d \nFinally opening his eyes, Midoriya looked at Bakugou. His pained, vacant expression stabbed at Bakugou\u2019s chest. \n\u201cYou\u2019ll get hypothermia! Get up, we need to get you warm now!\u201d Despite his words, Bakugou made no move to grab Midoriya and haul him up from the couch. He merely moved his hands, until they were under the other boys\u2019 armpits, gently nudging to encourage him to stand. \nThe steadying hands were all Midoriya needed to lift himself up. His stiff joints cried out as he wobbled, before finally he settled against Bakugou, his face falling against the blonde\u2019s neck. \n\u201cCome on, you need to shower,\u201d he murmured against green hair. \nStill, he made no move to force the other boy\u2019s movements. Simply waited, as Midoriya rested against his side. \n\u201cWhat the fuck is happening?\u201d A loud whisper broke Bakugou\u2019s attention. \nHe snapped his gaze up to face three dumbstruck classmates, each with gaping mouths and wide eyes.\n\u201cWhat are you extra\u2019s looking at!\u201d He barked. \nStuttering followed. None of the boys knew what to say, their eyes stuck on Midoriya who was actively cuddling the explosive hothead of 1-A, and Bakugou who was letting it happen. \n\u201cShut up and do something useful. Go make dinner you idiots!\u201d he turned to look at Midoriya. \u201cCome on Deku, we need to get you warm.\u201d\nHe wrapped his arms around the frozen boy and began guiding him to the staircase the others were standing in front of. He glared as they approached, and his friends were quick to jump out of the way. \n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking burn anything!\u201d He shouted over his shoulder. \nIt was only when they heard the slam of the door, and the beginning of the shower, that the trio moved.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Kaminari asked. \n\u00a0\nIn the bathroom, Bakugou made quick work of stripping Deku of his wet clothes. It may have been awkward, if the other boy were acting normally. However, his vacant stare and stiff movements showed that Deku was completely lost in his mind. \n\u201cUnder the water. Now,\u201d he directed, pushing Deku into the shower that was warm but not too hot. \nThe other boy simply went with no complaint. While he stood, unmoving under the stream of water, Bakugou quickly dashed out of the bathroom and into his room. There he grabbed a spare pair of sweats, and the largest, most comfortable jumper he owned. It was an All Might hoodie, and he would never be caught dead wearing it by his friends, but Bakugou knew Deku would appreciate the comfort, which was all he cared about right now. When he rushed back into the bathroom, he wasn\u2019t surprised to find Deku had not moved. \n\u201cOut,\u201d he dumped the clothes on the counter and moved to turn the shower off. \nDeku merely blinked, before stepping out into the open bathroom. Without a word, Bakugou draped a towel over his shoulders. \n\u201cCome on shitty nerd, dry yourself and don\u2019t make this weird,\u201d the words lack their usual heat, but they did get Deku to move. \nSlowly he began to dry himself while the other looked away. Once Bakugou deemed him dry enough, he helped the smaller boy into the clothes he had gathered. Midoriya\u2019s hair was still soaked once he was dressed, and Katsuki took care to sit the other on the edge of the bath, before tipping his head forward so he could run the towel through it, catching droplets of water from dripping onto the dry, warm clothes. When he was finally finished, the towel too damp to be effective, he dropped it to the bathroom floor. Deku\u2019s hair was slowly beginning to return to its fluffy mess, though it was still slightly damp. Katsuki couldn\u2019t stop himself from running his fingers through the tangled mess. He pushed the green locks away from Deku\u2019s forehead, ignoring the hum the other boy let out. \n\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d \nDeku shook his head. \n\u201cShitty Deku,\u201d he murmured, his voice soft. \u201cYou need to eat.\u201d\nMidoriya only nodded, barely comprehending the words. \n\u201cCome on. The idiots should have been able to handle dinner by now.\u201d\nBakugou turned to walk away, reaching for the door handle, but was stopped by the sudden yank at his shirt. When he turned his head to look, he wasn\u2019t surprised to see Deku\u2019s hand curled in his shirt, the boy\u2019s eyes turned to the ground and fixated on the bathroom tiles. \n\u201cCome on, Deku,\u201d He grabbed onto the others wrist, pulling him up but not dislodging the hold on his black t-shirt. \nTogether they walked down the stairs, Deku holding onto his shirt the entire way, the too large hoodie dwarfing the already shorter boy, making him look even smaller. Katsuki kept his hand closed around Deku\u2019s wrist. When they got close to the Kitchen, they could hear murmuring. \n\u201cIt\u2019s weird, right,\u201d Kaminari whispered. \nSero hummed in agreement. \n\u201cGuys, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just personal. They used to be super close right?\u201d Kirishima rubbed the back of his neck. \n\u201cDude, still. If it has Midoriya this freaked out, do you think we need to call in the pro\u2019s? He wasn\u2019t even this scared during the U.S.J break in.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m with Kaminari, this seems serious.\u201d\n\u201cWould you extra\u2019s stop talking about us!\u201d Bakugou barked, announcing their presence. \u201cNo Pro\u2019s!\u201d\nHis loud tone caused Deku to flinch slightly, but he remained silent. Bakugou growled at the guilt that gnawed at his chest. The three boys in the kitchen looked red, and cast their eyes to the ground, stewing in the guilt of being caught talking about their classmates. \n\u201cYou idiots have dinner sorted or what?\u201d\n\u201cTotally Bakubro! We hope it\u2019s as good as your Mom makes.\u201d\nBakugou rolled his eyes and led Deku to the dining table. He lowered himself and the other boy to a kneeling position. The entire time, Deku held on to the back of Bakugou\u2019s shirt, even as the three boys platted up the food, brought it over, and settled themselves down around the table. Kirishima, at least, was trying to keep his eyes averted to save his friend from some embarrassment. Sero and Kaminari however, were actively staring at Midoriya\u2019s hand attached to Bakugou\u2019s shirt. \n\u201cShut up and eat, dammit!\u201d Bakugou began platting up food with his chop sticks, before placing the bowl of rice, meat and vegetables in front of Midoriya. \nThe Greenette simply picked up his chopsticks and began eating as though the blonde hadn\u2019t just served his food to him. Without a word, Kirishima reached over and dropped some meat into Midoriya\u2019s bowl, earning himself a small, miniscule nod from Bakugou. The other two quickly jumped in, placing their own additions to Midoriya\u2019s bowl. He sniffled, looking through his lashes with teary eyes to shoot a grateful look to the group around him. \nThey ate in complete silence, the only noise in the room the sound of chopsticks ticking against the porcelain plates. Despite the concerned and confused looks he received from his friends, Bakugou simply ate with his head down. He could still feel Deku\u2019s hand fisted in the fabric of his shirt. \nWhen everyone had finished, Kirishima jumped up and began clearing the table. Sero was quick to join in helping, using his tape to wrap Kaminari and pull him into the kitchen to help. Bakugou watched for a moment while Midoriya stared vacantly at the now clear table.\n\u201cHow about we go up to my room and watch The All Might Movie?\u201d Bakugou murmured into Midoriya\u2019s ear, his breath tickling the green locks. \nMidoriya nodded. The beginning of a small smile graced his lips. The sight felt like someone had reached in and squeezed Bakugou\u2019s heart. He ground his teeth and bit back a yell of frustration brought on by the stupid feeling. \nTogether they stood up. Bakugou holding Deku\u2019s elbow to keep him balance. \n\u201cOi, extra\u2019s. We are watching a movie upstairs. When you\u2019re done, come up.\u201d\nThe pair received a thumbs up from Kirishima, and quickly made their way upstairs to Bakugou\u2019s room. Inside, the floor was covered in sleeping bags, pillows, and backpacks, every inch of carpet covered by the mess. \n\u201cGo and hop into bed. I\u2019ll set up.\u201d\nDeku made a noise of protest but was quickly silenced by a look. He squeezed Bakugou\u2019s shirt once more, before shuffling with his head down over the mess of sleeping bags to reach the others bed. Without hesitating, he pulled back the plain black covers and settled into the corner, tucking himself against the wall. He watched as Bakugou began rifling through his draws to find the old DVD they had watched together hundreds of times as children. Once he found it, he turned on his TV and got to work setting up his gaming console to play the movie. \n\u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d Kaminari bounced into the room, causing Midoriya to jump slightly. \nWithout pausing, the blonde made his way to sit at the end of the bed. Despite the carefree way he held himself, they all noticed how he lowered himself down on the bed, rather than dropping hazardously as he usually would. He also made sure to keep his distance from Midoriya, to keep from scaring the already fragile looking boy. \n\u201cThe All Might Movie,\u201d Bakugou didn\u2019t look up from the TV.\n\u201cOh, no way! Which one?\u201d\n\u201cThe first one. Duh!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I loved that movie as a kid,\u201d Kirishima entered with less flair than Kaminari, and simply settled on his sleeping back, throwing his hands behind his head in a stretch. \n\u201cI mean who doesn\u2019t love that movie,\u201d Sero sat beside him. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the one where he\u2019s in America right, with his sidekick?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure!\u201d\n\u201cWait which sidekick?\u201d\n\u201cShut up! I\u2019m about to press play.\u201d\n\u201cB-but Kacchan\u2026\u201d\nThe whispered words got the attention of all four boys. Midoriya had tucked himself so tightly into the corner it was hard to make out his small frame. His knees were hugged to his chest, and the hoodie was covering his head, leaving only a small part of his face visible. \nBakugou groaned. His cheeks were tinted red.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, hold on.\u201d \nWithout another word, he stomped to his walk-in closet and disappeared inside. \nWhile they waited for Bakugou, Kaminari leaned over so he was laying on his stomach and poked gently at Midoriya\u2019s leg, hoping to unravel the boy at least slightly. Without a word, Midoriya untucked an arm and reached out to hold Kaminari\u2019s hand. The blonde\u2019s eyes widened, his body stiffening in surprise. Still, he made no move to remove the others hand, and eventually interlocked their fingers together. The visible parts of Midoriya\u2019s face turned red. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear a fucking work from you three extra\u2019s, ok?\u201d Bakugou growled as he emerged from the closet. \nIn his hands he held a withered red, white and blue blanket, and an honest to god All Might plushie. Both were raggedy and worn but were handled with absolute care by Bakugou. His face was bright red. \nKaminari gasped, his eyes widened with delight. He looked absolutely ready to rip into Bakugou and his hidden treasure but stopped when there was a gentle squeeze to his hand.\n\u201cThank you, Kacchan,\u201d the words were whispered again. \nBakugou growled but stomped over and handed the childish items to Midoriya, who quickly let go of Kaminari\u2019s hand to grab the blanket and plushie. He made quick work of spreading out the blanket and tucked the plushie into the crook of his elbow, before once again snatching up Kaminari\u2019s hand. \nBakugou actively ignored the snickers of Kirishima and Sero who were covering their mouths with both hands. There was no way they would ever forget finding out Bakugou had a blanket and teddy in his closet. They knew; this knowledge would come back to haunt the fierce blonde. \nBakugou\u2019s face was still red when he walked over to finally press play on the movie. Just before he could though, he was once again interrupted.\n\u201cOh, what now!\u201d\nBakugou ripped his phone from his back pocket, the buzzing item ringing in his hand. His face changed when he saw the caller. \n\u201cI need to take this. Stay there Deku, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nMidoriya went rigid, and made to sit up, the hoodie slipping to reveal wild, frightened eyes. \n\u201cNo, stay there! Everything is fine, I\u2019m going out into the hallway, Dunce-face and the extras are staying here with you, so stay there and don\u2019t be weird!\u201d\nWithout another word he answered the call and stepped out into the hallway. Silence filled the room. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Midoriya. Whatever is wrong, we will help you,\u201d Kaminari squeezed the hand he was holding again, taking care not to accidentally shock the other. \n\u201cYeah, man, we have your back no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you need us to beat up anyone, we totally will,\u201d Sero nodded. \nMidoriya\u2019s bottom lip wobbled and he ran a hand across his face to wipe away the tears leaking down his cheeks. \n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, you guys.\u201d\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t be, man,\u201d Kirishima was quick to reassure. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but we\u2019re with you no matter what.\u201d\nMidoriya let out a choked sob but managed a strained smile that he directed to all the boys in the room. They waited a few minutes while Bakugou spoke on the phone in the hallway, his words a whispered murmur, too quite to make out. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna head to the bathroom really quick,\u201d Kirishima stood. \u201cWon\u2019t be long. Promise.\u201d\nHis departure didn\u2019t seem to worry Midoriya as much as Bakugou\u2019s did, so he quickly made his way to the hallway and closed the bedroom door behind him. In the hallway, he made no move to head to the bathroom. Instead, he watched his friend talk on the phone, his back to Kirishima. He could tell from the way he stood, shoulder tense, fist clenched, voice a low growl, that whatever was being said was serious. \n\u201cYeah, I got it Hag. We won\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he paused, listening to the response. \u201cYou just look after Auntie Inko. I got Izuku, alright?\u201d\nWith a final few word, Bakugou hung up the call. \n\u201cHey, bro,\u201d Kirishima tried to announce his presence without freaking the other out. \nBakugou\u2019s shoulder drew even tighter, the only indication he was caught by surprise. \n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t mean to intrude or anything. I know it\u2019s not my business,\u201d he rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cBut, do we need to be worried? This all seems really weird and Midoriya isn\u2019t acting like himself. I\u2019m getting a bit freaked out, man.\u201d\nHe kept his voice low so the others in the room wouldn\u2019t hear. Bakugou growled, his teeth grinding together so violently it was almost audible. He looked like he was gearing up to attack, and Kirishima readied in case he had to use his quirk and deflect the other boy\u2019s blasts. But, as immediately as he wound up, the fight left Bakugou with a deep, shuddering exhale. \n\u201cYour right, shitty hair, it is none of your business,\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice lacked its usual fight. \nKirishima nodded, ready to leave it alone. He turned to head back into Bakugou\u2019s room. He was stopped by his friend\u2019s words. \n\u201cHis Dad came back,\u201d Bakugou was staring intently the floor, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched. Kirishima turned and took a few stepped so he was closer to his friend.\n\u201cWhy is that bad?\u201d Kirishima scratched at his hair. \nBakugou scoffed, and looked at his friend with pained, hurt eyes. \n\u201cThe last time he was around, he put Izuku in the fucking hospital. That\u2019s why, shitty hair.\u201d\nKirishima felt like his blood was being replaced with ice, the cold blooming through his chest, and to his limbs. His breath felt like it has left him. \n\u201cFuck.\u201d\nBakugou shook his head.\n\u201cStupid Deku got in between his parents while they were fighting. He was fucking four, quirkless and still trying to play the hero. It only took one hit from his Dad, and he hit the wall and \u2026\u201d \nBakugou took in a deep, shuddering breath. \n\u201cHe was fucking four,\u201d he repeats, his voice cracking on the last word. \u201cAuntie Inko called Mom from the hospital. I don\u2019t even remember much about that day, except that I was being a fucking brat. Refused to get dressed, made it difficult for my parents to get in the car\u2026 I didn\u2019t even notice how serious they were, how freaked out they were. I just remember thinking, no way in hell am I having another playdate with that damn nerd today\u2019.\u201d\nHe shook his head in disgust, his lip grimacing. Kirishima stayed eerily silent, letting his friend speak in a way he usually never would. Open and vulnerable. \n\u201cAnyway, we finally get to the hospital and I think, fucking great Deku\u2019s hurt himself again. Probably tripped or something dumb like usual. Auntie was crying like he was dying but I didn\u2019t think anything of it, you know? She\u2019s always been like that. Then we were in the hospital room\u2026 and there\u2019s fucking Deku hooked up to all these fucking machines and his head is fucking bandaged. Didn\u2019t wake up for three days.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s eyes were alight with a fight he couldn\u2019t act on. His lips trembled like he wanted to yell. He stayed silent. \n\u201cWhat happened to his Dad?\u201d Kirishima wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know, but it was the question that slipped out. \n\u201cSkipped town,\u201d it looked like the words physically pained Bakugou to say. \u201cMom made Auntie get a restraining order. Turns out it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d hit her, but it was the first time he hurt Izuku, so she took it pretty seriously. She probably locked Deku in his room the second she saw his father today. She\u2019s been a bit over-protective of him ever since.\u201d\n\u201cIs she ok now?\u201d Kirishima implored, somewhat alarmed to know the woman could be getting hurt right now as they spoke. \n\u201cYeah, yeah, Mom and Dad got there before he could get violent. Apparently, he left before the police could get there but they doubt he will come here. He\u2019s too scared of Mom to try anything. I bet he\u2019ll slink back to America before he is caught. Fucking coward!\u201d\nSilence filled the hallway as Bakugou finished talking. Kirishima could feel the horror of the story rolling through his stomach, making him regret eating so much for dinner. \n\u201cMan, I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you both.\u201d\n\u201cNot like the asshole hit me! I would have killed him for even trying!\u201d\nKirishima shrugged.\n\u201cStill, you two were friends and you had to see Midoriya hurt like that. It would have sucked, man.\u201d\nBakugou clenched his jaw and looked away. \n\u201cWe should get back in there. Deku is probably freaking out.\u201d\nKirishima nodded and the two made their way into the room without another word. Inside, Kaminari and Sero were talking quietly while Midoriya stared intently at the door. He sat up straight once it opened. His eyes locked on Bakugou. \n\u201cAuntie is fine.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s entire body sagged, his head falling back against the wall with a thud. \n\u201cHitashi left before the police could get there, but they have patrols out looking for him. My bet is he\u2019ll be back in America the second he gets a chance.\u201d\nMidoriya nodded, before bringing his hands to his face. He scrubbed his eyes violently, and he began breathing heavily, his chest heaving in uncontrolled bouts like he was either laughing or crying. No one doubted it was the later. \nIn no time, Bakugou crossed the room and slid onto the bed next to Midoriya. He quickly wrapped an arm over his shoulders and tucked his mouth against the others ear to whisper reassurances. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya gasped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just \u2013 just left her. How could I just leave her?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do that!\u201d\n\u201cBut I-\u201d\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to fucking hear it, Deku. You\u2019re about to go on about how you\u2019re a shit hero that couldn\u2019t protect his Mom, even though she would have locked you in your room and forbid you from leaving it. Rightfully so! Your Dad was a piece of shit that put you in a fucking coma when you were fucking four!\u201d Bakugou felt some guilt saying all that in front of his friends but refused to look away from Midoriya to see their reactions. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that! You are a fucking hero and if you want to argue with me on that, how about I give Eri or that brat that punched you in the dick a call? Let\u2019s see what they have to say, huh?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Midoriya choked out, his throat closing around the words.\nBakugou took a deep breath.\n\u201cYeah, it was different. Tonight, you did everything right, because you didn\u2019t get hurt and neither did your mom. You came and got help like you were fucking meant to. So, don\u2019t fucking start with me, alright nerd?\u201d\nMidoriya shook his head and honest to god pouted. His bottom lip stuck out and shuddered as he fought to control his tears. He averted his eyes from everyone, and hunched over himself, pulling the withered All Might plushie onto his lap to hug. He trembled slightly. There was something about his small frame and pout made him look so much younger than he was. Dare anyone admit it, given how serious the current situation was, but Midoriya looked positively adorable. \nThe sight drew a strangled noise from Kaminari. He tried to hide his face behind his hands to keep the blush from showing and ruining the moment, but it was too late. Bakugou\u2019s attention focused to him, and Kaminari was faced with a glare had become all too familiar with. The \u2018I\u2019m one word away from blowing up and frying your ass\u2019 look. \n\u201cShould we put the movie on?\u201d Sero asked before Bakugou could go off. \nHis own face was slightly pink, and he was shooting worried looks to Midoriya. However, the group knew better than to prod the boy, who only 30 minutes earlier was practically mute. \n\u201cTch, whatever. Dunce-face,\u201d Bakugou kicked Kaminari of the bed. \u201cGo press play and turn off the lights!\u201d\n\u201cSo mean,\u201d Kaminari whined, rubbing his bottom as he stood from his fall. \nHe shuffled over to the tv, quickly surveying the room to check everyone was ready for the movie to start. Sero shot his tape and turned off the lights, while Kirishima punched his pillow into shape. Bakugou was right out cuddling Midoriya to his side, his arm slung around the boy\u2019s shoulders, the other wrapped around stomach, and though Midoriya was still sniffling, there was no denying he was leaning into the touch. Kaminari turned around to start the movie and made his way to his own sleeping back before the opening credits could begin. He sat just as the theme music began. \n\u201cStop pouting, damn Deku,\u201d Bakugou whispered into Midoriya\u2019s ear, his breath tickling his cheek. \u201cJust relax and watch the movie.\u201d\nMidoriya glanced at him out of the corner of the eye. Finally, he unwound leaning fully into Bakugou\u2019s touch, laying his head on his shoulder. He scooted so he was even closer, his legs resting over the others, and wound his hand back into the fabric of Bakugou\u2019s shirt. \nThe adrenaline, panic, and fear that had plagued him throughout the night was finally seeping from his body, and with its departure, Midoriya grew more and more tired. A deep exhaustion was settling in, and he struggled to focus on the bright glare of the television, as it played his favourite movie. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply the smell of caramel soaked into Bakugou\u2019s shirt. \n\u201cThanks, Kacchan,\u201d the murmured words were nearly swallowed by the sound of the movie, but Bakugou could hear them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined the sleepover.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fucking stupid, Deku,\u201d he glanced down at the exhausted boy.\nHe shifted them slightly, so they were laying down, keeping Midoriya\u2019s head tucked into his neck. \n\u201cGo to sleep, damn nerd. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d"
