    "text": "\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start at the beginning?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJames didn\u2019t respond, staring down at his shaking hands. Blood had congealed and dried along the creases of his palms, more blood becoming especially apparent beneath the torn sleeve of his left arm.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDetective Barnes,\u201d the man prompted gently, but James couldn\u2019t bring himself to look up, hypnotized by the rusty-red decorating his skin. \u201cDetective Barnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky startled awake, heart hammering.\n\u00a0\nHis hands were trembling as he fumbled to turn on the light. Dimly, he recalled the techniques he\u2019d been taught in therapy, mumbling, \u201cThirty-seven days,\u201d his eyes flicked to the digital clock, \u201cNineteen hours, twenty-six minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis hands continued to shake. His lips trembled. \u201cThirty-seven days, nineteen hours, twenty-six minutes,\u201d he repeated, voice shaking softly. \u201cThirty-seven...\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe repeated the numbers to himself until the shaking subsided, forcing himself to relax into the mattress. Bucky glanced at the clock and smiled humorlessly. \u201cThirty-seven days, nineteen hours, forty-eight minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomething about numbers was supposed to ground him. Keeping track of time acutely did ground him. The numbers too. Bucky had always been a numbers guy- thinking that way made sense to him in a way that not much else did. Especially now.\n\u00a0\nBucky felt that constricting feeling rising up in his throat again, but he shoved it away, angrily muttering, \u201cThirty-seven days, nineteen hours, forty-nine minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t manage to go back to sleep. Instead, he turned the TV on and pretended to watch a show about weird houses.\n\u00a0\nHe only got out of bed to start the day when the clock changed so that it had been exactly thirty-eight days.\n\u00a0\nIt was thirty-eight days and counting.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky stared at the post-it note on the refrigerator that had been there for eight days, six hours, and eleven minutes.\n\u00a0\n\nWill be sending company. (X) Fury\n\n\u00a0\nCompany had not been sent to the small suburban house, and the note hung over Bucky\u2019s head like a bad omen. First of all, Bucky didn\u2019t need company. He was perfectly capable of defending himself. Secondly, Fury could suck his dick.\n\u00a0\n(Although Bucky was fairly certain the scary FBI agent wasn\u2019t into that sort of thing.)\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced at the mail stacked neatly on the counter, some envelopes addressed to Buchanan Rogers. Bucky had gotten to pick his first name, figuring that no one had called him \u201cBucky\u201d since he told his sister that it was a baby\u2019s name and embarrassed her into calling him James instead. Bucky figured it was safe to use it here. It was something he\u2019d respond to and wouldn\u2019t lead anyone to suspicions regarding his actual identity.\n\u00a0\nEven if it was kind of a weird nickname, Bucky liked it.\n\u00a0\nDuring the eight days (six hours, fifteen- shut up) that he\u2019d been in the house, he\u2019d fallen into a rhythm. He\u2019d pretend to sleep, pretend to watch TV, eat mechanically at the correct times, rinse, and repeat.\n\u00a0\nThe mandatory therapist that he\u2019d seen for the three mandatory sessions had basically only been useful for her numbers thing. Bucky hadn\u2019t opened up enough for her to give him a proper diagnoses, but it went without saying that he was fucked up. Bucky didn\u2019t need a fancy degree to come to that conclusion. And he didn\u2019t need help.\n\u00a0\nIt was even worse after the-\n\u00a0\nAfter the-\n\u00a0\nThe-\n\u00a0\nWell.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThirty-eight days, thirty-eight minutes,\u201d Bucky whispered.\n\u00a0\nThe neighborhood was fine, at least from what Bucky had seen from his limited exposure thus far. His next-door neighbor to the right waved amiably whenever he saw Bucky timidly venture outside to pick up his mail. His neighbors to the left hadn\u2019t yet acknowledged him, but Bucky thought he saw a middle-aged couple with a teenage girl occupying the house.\n\u00a0\nAcross the street were the sweet old ladies who Bucky had only seen once when he was watching the street behind the safety of his window. Next to them (diagonally right from Bucky) was another couple that had left cookies on his doorstep when he\u2019d first moved in. The post-it note attached had a little smiley face and read: from Natasha and Clint AKA your best neighbors. On the other side of the old ladies was some guy who Bucky had only ever seen wearing sunglasses- even at night.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d scope them all out completely eventually. He was just a little reluctant to leave the house for prolonged periods of time at present.\n\u00a0\nBucky hadn\u2019t realized that he was staring vacantly at the floor for what was probably too long until there was a knock at the door. Bucky startled, pulse sky-rocketing for a moment. He ignored his nerves and tiptoed quietly to the door.\n\u00a0\nBucky put a hand on the glock in his belt before he opened the door a crack. Outside stood a tall, nicely-proportioned man. (And by \u201cnicely-proportioned,\u201d Bucky meant \u201ca walking wet-dream.\u201d) The flare of the sun made Bucky squint as he took in the man\u2019s chiseled features, all-American blonde hair, and blue eyes. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked warily.\n\u00a0\nThe man ducked his head sheepishly, averting Bucky\u2019s eyes for a second before meeting them. They were so ridiculously blue that Bucky kind of wanted to ask if he wore colored contacts. \u201cUm. I\u2019m Steve. Steven Rogers. I\u2019m... company.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky narrowed his eyes, knowing that Steve was referencing Fury\u2019s note. It didn\u2019t escape him that Steve shared his assumed last name. \u201cAre you gonna be my cousin?\u201d Bucky asked dully.\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cHusband, actually,\u201d he said easily, holding up his left hand to show a typical golden band.\n\u00a0\nBucky scowled and closed the door.\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause before Steve knocked softly again. \u201cIs this a homophobia thing?\u201d he asked, voice muffled through the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bucky snapped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen can I come in?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky locked the door, knowing the sound was audible.\n\u00a0\nHe heard Steve sigh. \u201cWhy are you being difficult about this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t need help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shook his head, stalking towards the kitchen and crumpling Fury\u2019s post-it note. He uncrumpled it, carefully tore it into tiny squares, and tossed the remains in the recycling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019d look unseemly if one of the neighbors saw me stranded on your porch,\u201d Steve called dryly.\n\u00a0\nBucky shook his head, not deigning to reply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can pick this lock, Buchanan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bucky,\u201d Bucky said without thinking, forgetting about his silent treatment for a second. Then he scowled at the door, as if Steve was responsible.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, Bucky then.\u201d There was a pause. Bucky shuffled uneasily in the foyer. \u201cPlease let me in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky crossed his arms indignantly, even though Steve couldn\u2019t see him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scoffed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my job,\u201d Steve said, a dangerous edge coming into his deep voice. Bucky was surprised and embarrassed to find the sound sending a thrill through his gut.\n\u00a0\nWhen Bucky didn\u2019t say anything to that, there was another stretch of silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI read your file,\u201d Steve finally said, quietly. Bucky straightened, panic and anger and curiosity shooting through him all at once. \u201cI know what they did to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Bucky hissed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to start a fight,\u201d Steve said, sounding annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that I understand.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou understand nothing,\u201d Bucky said darkly.\n\u00a0\nSteve made a noncommittal noise. \u201cI brought bagels and lox\u00a0from your favorite deli.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis caught Bucky\u2019s attention. \u201cSesame?\u201d he asked hesitantly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky cursed himself and his love for that damn deli as he unlocked the door and opened it. Steve looked pleasantly surprised and too smug for the American-wholesome-boy-next-door image he had going for him. Seriously- he was wearing khakis.\n\u00a0\nSteve stood from where he\u2019d been sitting on the porch, grabbing his suitcase and walking inside.\n\u00a0\nBucky immediately closed the door and engaged the four locks. Steve whistled. \u201cNice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBagels,\u201d Bucky demanded.\n\u00a0\nSteve wordlessly handed over a brown bag, stock full of bagels, lox, and cream cheese. Bucky made a pleased noise at the sight and dropped the bag on the table, preparing one of the bagels just the way he liked it- with a heap of lox\u00a0and minimal cream cheese. When he bit down, an almost pornographic moan rose from deep in his throat as his eyes fluttered shut.\n\u00a0\nBucky cracked an eye open to see Steve looking distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cIf you have sex with that bagel, I\u2019m going to request a transfer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky snorted despite himself, causing Steve to grin triumphantly. \u201cJealous?\u201d Bucky taunted after he\u2019d swallowed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery,\u201d Steve said, trying to look as serious as he could.\n\u00a0\nBucky returned his attention to the bagel. It had been so long since he\u2019d last eaten one. The bagels at the grocery store didn\u2019t even belong in the same category as these. These bagels were superior to all other bagels. They were amazing enough that Bucky could almost tolerate Steve\u2019s awkwardly hovering presence.\n\u00a0\nAlmost being the key word.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t just fuckin\u2019 stand there. Sit down. Or make coffee if you wanna be useful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned, the young lines of his face pulling into something nearly unattractive. \u201cI think I prefer to stand,\u201d he said, voice hard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStubborn little shit, are you?\u201d Bucky said dryly before taking another bite.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been said,\u201d Steve agreed mildly.\n\u00a0\nIt was silent as Bucky finished his bagel.\n\u00a0\nThen, Steve addressed the elephant in the room, placing a golden ring on the table in front of Bucky. \u201cCongrats, hubby,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you though,\u201d Bucky grumbled, eying the ring with distrust. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be my cousin or some shit?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t look much like you and having your cousin stay at your house for the foreseeable future seems weird and dysfunctional. It attracts attention.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Steve said, \u201cbut people make snap-judgments.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd being a gay couple doesn\u2019t attract attention,\u201d Bucky said flatly.\n\u00a0\nSteve drew up his shoulders, stance becoming coiled and defensive. \u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot with the gay thing- I\u2019m bi. That part is whatever.\u201d Steve visibly relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m just opposed to the idea of pretending I\u2019m in love someone. Not to mention being comfortable around them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe\u2019ll work at it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wrinkled his nose, glaring at the ring.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook we\u2019ve already thoroughly established a cover this way, and the rings were really expensive, and the agency paid for them. I\u2019d feel bad if you refused to wear it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky, being frugal with money himself, sighed in defeat, reluctantly slipping the ring on.\n\u00a0\nSteve reached into his bag and tossed Bucky a piece of paper that had probably been forged by some FBI people. \u201cHappy marriage,\u201d Steve said. Bucky looked at the certificate and rubbed a hand across his jaw, feeling the stubble there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get that framed probably,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tapered into silence, staring at his watch as the seconds ticked by.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Steve began awkwardly.\n\u00a0\nBucky shoved to his feet, chair legs scraping against the hardwood floor. \u201cWe can talk covers later. I need a minute,\u201d he muttered before stalking off, beating a retreat upstairs and locking himself in his room.\n\u00a0\nBucky slid to a sitting position, tucking in the farthest corner with his knees drawn to his chest. He took his glock out of his waistband and ran his fingers over it, closing his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThirty-eight days, one hour, two minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky watched Steve warily as he unpacked his things.\n\u00a0\nSteve was talking easily about their cover story as he sorted through his things. At the moment, he was stocking a high-tech, well-hidden safe with plenty of guns and ammunition, handling the items like he was more comfortable with them than with human conversation.\n\u00a0\nBucky listened attentively to what was going to be their established history. He thought the story was a little too dull, but he kept his mouth shut.\n\u00a0\nFinally, he blurted, \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be a little more exciting?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked up from his task, lips pursed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a standard boy-meets-boy, they fall in love, they get married, they move to suburbia to live a boring life story. It should be more exciting. Or at least have a cute twist. If we\u2019re gonna have to tell this story a bunch, people are gonna think we\u2019re cute as fuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around when it comes to cuteness, Steve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you... making a joke?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky allowed his lips to quirk slightly, watching bemusedly as Steve\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cBut, for real. We\u2019ve gotta throw in something really cute. People don\u2019t coo at married people for standard stories.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cMaybe boring stories should be exactly what people want, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of imagination? Action! Romance! Adventure! Sex!\u201d Bucky announced, spreading his arms out.\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen in real life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe hell it does. My mom met my dad because she stole my dad\u2019s motorcycle three times. He asked her out by stealing her car.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWere your parents delinquents?\u201d he asked incredulously.\n\u00a0\nBucky held his thumb and forefinger a centimeter apart, making a vague noise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ignored him deliberately. \u201cOkay: new story. We knew each other since we were kids, and I went off to war-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky, this sounds like the start to a Nicholas Sparks-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201c-and you thought I died, and you were super sad and shit because you just realized you were in love with me. But, I miraculously survived this freak accident-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat freak accident?\u201d Steve asked, amused.\n\u00a0\nBucky faltered. \u201cUh- I fell off a train.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA train?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. And got amnesia.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve made a noise in the back of his throat. \u201cNow you\u2019re just being ridiculous.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s lips curved into a smile as he went on. \u201cWhen you saw me again, I didn\u2019t recognize you, and you thought you had seen a ghost. But you figured you had nothing to lose when you approached me, and when you were sure it was me, you kissed me, and all my memories came back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Steve said, trying to stifle a laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou proposed to me while we were trying to take down the bastards who sabotaged the train I fell off in the first place. Like the scene from Pirates of the Caribbean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey were getting married in that scene, not proposing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, but that doesn\u2019t fit with the story.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve giggled. \u201cOh, we\u2019re worrying about realism now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky couldn\u2019t contain a little smile. \u201cOh, shut up. It\u2019s better than what you had.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we compromise?\u201d Steve suggested, still smiling a little.\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey settled on something a little tamer than Bucky\u2019s extravagant idea (\u201cIt could totally be a hit romance movie, Steve, hear me out- a thriller romance movie- Steve, are you listening?\u201d) and a little more exciting than Steve\u2019s lame idea (\u201cIt\u2019s just plausible, Bucky, and it\u2019s uncomplicated... But fine. Not like I care that my idea is better or anything.\u201d)\n\u00a0\nAfter they\u2019d finally agreed on something plausible, Steve dragged Bucky outside to retrieve the mail.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s next-door neighbor to the right was gardening, and straightened with intrigue when he saw them.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019M not a hermit, Stevie,\u201d Bucky grumbled, letting the nickname roll off his tongue naturally.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhile I was gone, you were,\u201d Steve argued happily, approaching the mailbox as Bucky trailed after him, scowling, hands shoved in pockets.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMost of these are addressed to some guy named Bruce Banner,\u201d Steve observed, leafing through the envelopes.\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cYeah, he was the last person to live here. He had to leave kind of abruptly apparently.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned at the envelopes. \u201cDo you think we kicked him out?\u201d he asked quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve pursed his lips, a crease forming between his brows. As Bucky watched Steve with a carefully blank face, the next-door neighbor approached them, removing dirty gardening gloves. \u201cBeautiful day,\u201d the man remarked, tossing a look their way.\n\u00a0\nBucky tried to smile and knew it fell short. \u201cSure is,\u201d he agreed half-heartedly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve officially met. I\u2019m Sam Wilson.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked up, perceptive eyes sweeping over Sam\u2019s form. Bucky realized that Steve wasn\u2019t planning on responding first after an awkward beat. \u201cBuchanan Rogers,\u201d he returned, \u201cBut you can call me Bucky. This is my... husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\nSam looked amused. \u201cNewlyweds?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d Steve asked dryly.\n\u00a0\nSam chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m good at reading people.\u201d He looked at Bucky. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you had a husband. I assumed it was just you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Stevie, here, had to wrap up some things with his work. I moved out here a week early to get us settled,\u201d Bucky said, trying his best not to sound passive-aggressive towards Steve, lest Sam pick something up.\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned at Bucky. \u201cI was only gone a week.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky arched an eyebrow. \u201cEight days, nine hours-\u201c he cut himself off before he blurted the minutes since he\u2019d arrived at the house too. Sam and Steve were already looking at him oddly. Bucky turned his gaze to the ground. \u201cAnyways.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve reached out and clasped Bucky\u2019s shoulder with surprising firmness. The touch was grounding in a really nice way- not that Bucky would ever admit it. \u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d he said softly.\n\u00a0\nBucky bit his lip to keep from saying exactly how long Steve had been here (three hours, sixteen- shut up).\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou two are cute,\u201d Sam said, smiling, albeit a little sadly for whatever reason.\n\u00a0\nBucky flushed, but gave Steve a smug look. Steve rolled his eyes, dropping his hand from Bucky\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHear that, Stevie,\u201d he teased, \u201cWe\u2019re cute.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve coughed, ducking his head and ignoring Bucky. \u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam shrugged, then nodded to the envelopes. \u201cAre you still getting Bruce\u2019s mail?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky and Steve nodded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave a forwarding address,\u201d Bucky said quietly.\n\u00a0\nSam sighed, scratching the back of his head. \u201cNobody knows where he went... Tell you what, the next best thing is Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. They were sort of tight,\u201d Sam said, and Bucky tried not to think about how cryptic that sounded. \u201cI\u2019ll invite him, Natasha and Clint, and you guys over for dinner tomorrow, how\u2019s that sound? You can give Tony the letters and meet the squad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe squad?\u201d Steve echoed.\n\u00a0\nSam smirked. \u201cThe squad,\u201d he agreed.\n\u00a0\nBucky huffed a laugh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that grown-ass men referred to their friend groups as a \u2018squad.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam laughed, and the sound was actually pretty beautiful. Sam was a good-looking guy. If the circumstances were different, Bucky probably would\u2019ve already turned this conversation towards flirting. But the circumstances were how they were: Steve was Bucky\u2019s alleged husband and Bucky was fucked up in the head. \u201cJust getting with the times, dude. I didn\u2019t know that my new neighbor was actually a ninety-five year-old man,\u201d Sam teased.\n\u00a0\nBucky scoffed, shooting a glance at Steve. \u201cHow dare you accuse me of that when we\u2019re standing next to the guy wearing khakis.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my khakis?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam giggled. \u201cDude. You two are both grandpas. This is perfect.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smirked, disrupting the wholesome American vibes yet again. \u201cI think I could change your mind,\u201d he said, dropping his voice low.\n\u00a0\nA shiver went down Bucky\u2019s spine, but he ignored it, instead opting to look at Steve incredulously. \u201cAre you flirting with the hot next-door neighbor in front of me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve snorted while Sam laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bucky. I\u2019m a committed man,\u201d Sam said, raising his hand to show a silver wedding band. \u201cAlthough I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t hit that,\u201d he conceded, eying Steve.\n\u00a0\nSteve blushed, and Bucky nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about me like I\u2019m your property, Buck. At least, not outside closed doors,\u201d Steve said cheekily, and Bucky sputtered.\n\u00a0\nSam held up both hands. \u201cI am going to pretend that I did not hear that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWise man,\u201d Steve said, slinging his arm across Bucky\u2019s waist. Bucky tried not to show his surprise, and ended up leaning into the touch after a pause.\n\u00a0\n(It had sort of been a while since anyone besides doctors and other, less-savory folks had touched Bucky. He was maybe a tiny bit touch-starved. Not that it mattered.)\n\u00a0\nSteve started rubbing these little circles with his thumb across the fabric of Bucky\u2019s shirt. The movement definitely didn\u2019t distract Bucky.\n\u00a0\nSam gave Bucky a smirking, knowing look that told him he wasn\u2019t fooling anyone. Bucky looked at the ground, and Sam started backing away, pointing at them. \u201cTomorrow at seven, lover-boys.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou got it, Sam,\u201d Steve agreed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, so we have a little bit over twenty-four hours to get to know each other.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced at his watch and did some snap calculations. \u201cOver thirty hours.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at Bucky curiously. \u201cYou keep doing that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky bristled. \u201cDoing what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe time thing. Is it just a thing you do or what?\u201d Steve asked, and he sounded genuinely interested.\n\u00a0\nBucky glared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Steve sighed, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky started picking at the hem of his shirt- a comfortable red Henley that Bucky had been wearing for the past three days. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d Bucky asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shot Steve a look. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to know each other, right? Your favorite color, Steve.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smothered a little smile, going to sit on one end of the couch in Bucky\u2019s living room. Bucky hesitated before sitting on the other side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like them all,\u201d Steve said honestly. \u201cToday, I think I\u2019m feeling blue, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat kind of blue?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNavy.\u201d Steve paused, lips curling. \u201cI kind of hate royal blue. It makes me sad to look at.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky was startled into a little laugh. \u201cI thought you said you like all the colors?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve made a face. \u201cHyperbole, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPunk,\u201d Bucky muttered under his breath, rolling his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSteve pretended not to hear. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color, then, smartass?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cRed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike your shirt?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAny red. I dunno. It\u2019s eye-catching.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRed is interesting,\u201d Steve mused. \u201cIt represents both violence and love. Ain\u2019t that weird?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird at all. Don\u2019t those two go hand-in-hand?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly a pessimistic way of looking at things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey. I\u2019m not a pessimist. I\u2019m a realist. Big difference,\u201d Bucky said seriously.\n\u00a0\nSteve broke into a grin. \u201cYou know, every single person I\u2019ve ever called a pessimist has said something along those lines.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, us realists know what\u2019s up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve snorted. \u201cAlright, whatever. You enjoy being sad and disillusioned.\u201d Bucky nodded, pretending to raise a glass. \u201cFavorite movie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u201d Bucky said immediately.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, you were prepared for that one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a Star Trek guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd what would be wrong with that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing. I\u2019m cool with Star Trek. I just don\u2019t want you to be under the impression that it\u2019s better than Star Wars.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, no need to worry. I haven\u2019t seen either,\u201d Steve admitted.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time to be caught up with pop culture.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve, these movie franchises are not new developments,\u201d Bucky said incredulously. \u201cStar Wars and Star Trek are like... historic. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to force me to watch all of them, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Steve asked, resigned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot the prequels. Those are optional,\u201d Bucky mused, already trying to plan a good time for a movie marathon.\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed, leaning back in his seat and looking tired at the thought.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked back to the present. \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about this more later. Your favorite movie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm...\u201d Steve ducked his head, a blush coloring his cheeks. \u201cHow to Train your Dragon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stared at Steve in surprise.\n\u00a0\nSteve was quick to say, \u201cLook, when you have amazing animation, story, score, and characters all rolled into one, I\u2019m a goner. Plus: dragons.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky giggled. \u201cOh my god. You\u2019re not a bodyguard. You\u2019re a fucking dork.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve jutted out his amazing jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not even a bodyguard. I\u2019m an agent.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd a dork.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve lifted a nonplussed shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of worse.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen Bucky stopped giggling, they sat in silence for a moment. \u201cOkay. New question. Favorite food.\u201d Bucky smirked. \u201cI bet it\u2019s apple pie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Although, apple pie is pretty damn amazing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky grinned, opening his mouth to boast in triumph, but Steve cut him off with a look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI happen to be partial to shawarma.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh. Nice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky jerked his thumb in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cBagels from Maria\u2019s Deli.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve tipped his head back to laugh, exposing the tendons of his neck. Bucky tried not to stare, but he was only human. \u201cI should have guessed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThose bagels are too good for this world,\u201d Bucky murmured, gaze going distant.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, god. Do you need a minute alone with the bagels?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that the bagels and I are very happy together.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve was still smiling with his stupidly full lips. Bucky decided he could get used to the expression. \u201cOkay. Favorite memory.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky thought about it for a moment, mood sobering. \u201cMy sister and I always used to do this dumb thing. It started when I was reading Harry Potter in the fifth grade, and Becca wanted to read it too, so I was a ten-year-old dick and told her that Dumbledore dies \u2018cause I thought Becca was being an annoying copycat. It became a thing, and whenever we got annoying, we\u2019d spoil books or TV shows for each other. I hated her so much for it, but it was also totally out of love? I don\u2019t know how to explain it. But there was this one time when Becca and I were home for Christmas, and my ma was being annoying about asking if I\u2019d met anyone special yet. Becca and I knew she\u2019d started watching Breaking Bad and had gotten completely hooked on it. So Becca looked straight at me, smiled, and spoiled the ending for ma.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve was watching, an indecipherable expression on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s hostile.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMa was furious,\u201d Bucky agreed, smiling sadly. \u201cBut she stopped bothering me about being lonely and shit, and Becca was there to look out for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou really love her,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Bucky sighed, staring at his lap. \u201cHow about you? Favorite memory?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA wrinkle appeared between Steve\u2019s eyebrows, and he licked his lips. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting out of this one, Steve,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cI just spilled my guts. Don\u2019t make me feel awkward about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA light blush spread across Steve\u2019s features. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. And I barely know you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to judge you,\u201d Bucky said seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll never do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned, but a gleam had returned to his eyes. \u201cExcept about not having seen Star Wars?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Stark Trek,\u201d Bucky agreed.\n\u00a0\nSteve puffed out a breath. \u201cOkay, well... It\u2019s kind of a long story.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got time- about thirty hours,\u201d Bucky reminded Steve gently.\n\u00a0\nSteve seemed to gather his strength. He turned to Bucky fully, a note of defiance lacing his posture. \u201cWhen I was born, the doctors were certain that I was going to die.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s eyes widened. This was not what he\u2019d been expecting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was premature, had underdeveloped lungs, an undeveloped eardrum, a heart murmur, scoliosis, nutrient deficiencies, and a number of other ailments I won\u2019t bore you with. Anyway, my mother was told that I was halfway dead, and that she had two choices.\u201d Steve paused, biting at his lips absentmindedly. \u201cShe could either try to raise me herself or pretty much sell me to the government.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Bucky breathed.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes flicked towards Bucky and then back downwards. \u201cNow, from what I\u2019ve been told, my mother wasn\u2019t doing very well. My father was out of the picture, her debt was incredible, her paycheck was insignificant, and she\u2019d just been diagnosed with cancer. She knew she could hardly take care of a healthy baby, let alone me. So, she agreed to let the government have me on one condition.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d Bucky asked, absorbed in the story.\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled sadly, finally meeting Bucky\u2019s gaze fully and steadily. \u201cThat if she survived cancer long enough, she\u2019d get to meet me some day. And the government agreed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed, and the sound was bitter. \u201cThe government had some experimental tests. They were trying to create something to help soldiers get stronger without impairing their mental faculties- I don\u2019t know all the details. The tests had side effects that I can\u2019t really legally talk about. But I survived. And so did my mother. I met her when I was twenty-one. Her name is Sarah, and that day was probably the best day of my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Bucky whispered, wanting to reach out to Steve and do something dumb like brush the hair away from his forehead or hold his hand.\n\u00a0\nSteve was quiet for a long time. \u201cWe meet up whenever we can, but I literally belong to the United States government.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t technically exist, you know,\u201d Steve mused, almost to himself. \u201cI was proclaimed a stillbirth.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cIt is what it is. New question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stared at Steve for a moment in confusion. For the life of him, he could not get a good read on this guy. After a moment of consideration, he figured it was best to move on from the solemnity of the conversation. \u201cFavorite animal?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked visibly relieved that Bucky had let him off the hook (for now). \u201cOh, shit. I have no idea... Maybe dogs? I really like dogs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled a little bit. \u201cI see it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky thought about it. \u201cPanthers are hella cool. I\u2019ve liked them since I had to make a poster about them in the third grade.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d Steve said, smirking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try to make a better poster.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve actually rose halfway out of his seat before collapsing back into the couch, looking at Bucky. \u201cYou were joking.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tapped his nose in silent agreement, trying not to laugh at Steve\u2019s swiftness to the challenge.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that in my file?\u201d Bucky asked dryly.\n\u00a0\nSteve lifted a shoulder. \u201cNo. I never got to see your real name or any concrete details- just your background and the incident.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky mulled over this new information for a moment. Steve had only seen the worst of him. It was a wonder that he was even here right now. \u201cMarch 10th.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThat was last month, wasn\u2019t it? How old are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed. \u201cUm. Twenty-eight. Um. When\u2019s your birthday?\u201d he said awkwardly, trying not to think about how he spent his own birthday that year.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked away quickly, and it took Bucky a moment to realize that he was embarrassed. \u201cUm. Don\u2019t laugh, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would I-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s July 4th.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd how could Bucky not? He burst into a fit of giggles, delighted. \u201cOh my god. Are you-? You\u2019re serious! Oh my god. Hey, Steve, I\u2019ve got a question for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve stared at him, resigned. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh say, can you see by the dawn\u2019s early light?\u201d Bucky asked with mock sincerity.\n\u00a0\nSteve blinked, unimpressed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can feel the patriotism, Steve,\u201d Bucky said sarcastically, nudging Steve with his toe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not patriotic,\u201d Steve sighed, looking heavenward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, cruel irony,\u201d Bucky said gleefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is why I never tell anyone my birthday.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who brought up that question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at Bucky tiredly. \u201cIt was a lapse in judgment.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey went on like this, learning dumb and insignificant things about each other. They kept the rest of the conversation light-hearted after Steve\u2019s discomfort with the whole favorite memory thing, and Bucky was kind of glad for it. By the time they\u2019d ordered in take-out and had finished eating, Bucky registered with mild shock that he hadn\u2019t checked the time for six hours.\n\u00a0\n(Well, six hours and fourteen minutes.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit, have we really been talking this whole time?\u201d Steve asked when he noticed Bucky\u2019s surprise.\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded, suddenly feeling shy. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel that long to me either,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you know what they say. Time flies when you\u2019re having fun,\u201d Steve said lightly, smiling in Bucky\u2019s direction.\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t say anything for a minute. Then (because he was apparently a masochist), \u201cYou read my file.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned, all of the lines in his face becoming visible. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not scared.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve considered. \u201cMaybe on your behalf. But scared of you? No. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could snap at any minute,\u201d Bucky continued, not sure why he was pressing this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think we could handle it if you did. They didn\u2019t send me for nothing,\u201d Steve muttered, looking away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat maybe you should be the one who\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey stared at each other, tense.\n\u00a0\nBucky shifted uneasily. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled humorlessly. \u201cI mean that I\u2019m the only one dangerous enough to protect you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA shiver went down Bucky\u2019s spine. Steve\u2019s gaze was intense, and his eyes were hard but curiously devoid of emotion. For the first time since Bucky had met Steve, he was absolutely certain that this man was not what he seemed to be. He wasn\u2019t an all-American boy-next-door. He wasn\u2019t an out-of-touch grandpa who wore khakis unironically. Bucky wasn\u2019t sure what Steve was, and he didn\u2019t know if he wanted to find out.\n\u00a0\nBucky cleared his throat, dropping his gaze and effectively breaking the moment. \u201cUm. The guest room is upstairs. First door on the left. My room is right across the hall, if you need me. I\u2019m- uh- going to turn in early.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve watched him carefully, his face blank. \u201cDon\u2019t freak out if you hear me moving around in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d Bucky said slowly, glancing up with a question in his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled ruefully. He must have seen Bucky\u2019s curiosity because he explained, \u201cI don\u2019t sleep much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded. \u201cWell, welcome to the club,\u201d he muttered under his breath before making a break for his room.\n\u00a0\nBucky knew that this was the time of evening that only grandparents went to bed, but he didn\u2019t really care. He knew he wouldn\u2019t sleep, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay down there with Steve for much longer without saying the Absolute Wrong Thing.\n\u00a0\nSo, Bucky curled into a ball in the center of his bed and pretended to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe story goes like this:\n\u00a0\nJames Barnes was a private detective in Brooklyn, pretending he knew exactly what he was doing with his life.\n\u00a0\nJames wasn\u2019t necessarily swimming in money, but he got by with the cases that came to him. His customers were loyal and willing to pay the price to get information.\n\u00a0\nAs winter churned onwards with gusto, James received a new client named Jasper Sitwell. Sitwell was suspicious that his boss was embezzling funds and perhaps doing something even shadier on the side. He hired James to investigate.\n\u00a0\nWhat James found could hardly be described as \u201csomething shady.\u201d What he gradually uncovered was a criminal organization so deeply rooted in New York City that James could hardly tell who was a part of the organization and who was a victim of the organization.\n\u00a0\nJust as James realized that he was way out of his depth with the case, things went south. James met with Sitwell to discuss his findings so far and apologize for deciding to turn the case over to someone more capable of doing something about it. Sitwell turned on James, claiming that the organization had blackmailed him into trading James for protection. So, Sitwell brought James directly to the leader of the organization, Alexander Pierce.\n\u00a0\nJames was tortured in many creative ways under Pierce\u2019s supervision. The worst of the torture involved a drug that tampered with memory. James lost sense of time and continuously woke up with blood on his hands, not sure whether it belonged to him or someone else.\n\u00a0\nAfter what James learned had been around three months, someone caught him while he was under the influence of the drug (and apparently had been on his way to kill the mayor and his family). James woke up in a questioning room, but his case was quickly referred to the FBI. After pouring over evidence that indicated James\u2019 innocence in any crimes he may have been associated with, the agency determined that the witness protection program would be the best way to keep James safe from the nameless organization, and in return James gave them all the information he had.\n\u00a0\nHe was moved to a suburban neighborhood in upstate New York.\n\u00a0\nAt least here, Bucky could keep track of the time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky stepped out of bed when the clock turned so that it had been exactly thirty-nine days.\n\u00a0\nSteve wasn\u2019t in the kitchen when Bucky slumped to the coffee machine dejectedly. Bucky rested his head on the cold marble of the counter, letting his eyes close as the coffee machine churned in agitation.\n\u00a0\nWhen Steve quietly came back inside from wherever he\u2019d been, he found Bucky staring blankly at broken shards of what had previously been his favorite coffee mug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve asked warily, stepping into the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked slowly and looked up. Steve was a little bit sweaty, wearing workout clothes that looked at least a size too small- not that Bucky was complaining or anything. As Steve stared at him with growing concern, Bucky looked back down at his broken cup for a moment, then back up at Steve. \u201cIt broke,\u201d Bucky said, voice coming out raspy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d Steve asked slowly.\n\u00a0\nBucky shifted, wincing when he stepped on a piece of ceramic. \u201cI dropped it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou dropped it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded. \u201cOn the way to get coffee.\u201d Bucky clenched his fists. \u201cI haven\u2019t had coffee.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019m gonna grab the vacuum cleaner.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t move, looking mournfully between the shards of ceramic and the coffee maker. Steve returned, vacuuming what he could from around Bucky\u2019s feet. When he was finished, Bucky immediately searched for a new mug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait. Buck- you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged, pouring the hot coffee into his new mug.\n\u00a0\nSteve took him by surprise when he grabbed Bucky by the shoulders and steered him to sit down, grabbing his ankle and placing his foot on another chair. Bucky stared at the sole of his foot and- okay, yeah- that was blood.\n\u00a0\nA winkle appeared between Steve\u2019s brows as he cleaned away the blood to make sure the cut was clean. Then, he layered two Snoopy Band-Aids over the cut.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Bucky whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t get used to it. I just didn\u2019t want to see you bleed out,\u201d Steve said teasingly. \u201cLike, for real. You didn\u2019t even notice you got cut.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have a really high pain tolerance,\u201d Bucky told Steve wryly.\n\u00a0\nSteve shot him a troubled look but said nothing. Good, Bucky thought with some morbid satisfaction, he should be uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\nAfter a few minutes of sipping coffee in silence (Steve had gone to pour his own cup), Bucky asked, \u201cDid you go for a run or something?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Yeah. It helps me think less.\u201d Steve lifted a shoulder with a little self-deprecating smile. The movement let his shirt stretch, and for a moment, Bucky was actually worried that the fabric was going to tear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Bucky said awkwardly, trying desperately to find the easy banter from yesterday. Instead of finding that, they tapered off into more silence.\n\u00a0\n(Bucky was trying not to ogle Steve\u2019s chest, but... seriously. Steve\u2019s pecks were so defined and muscular that Bucky almost wanted to buy him a bra. It was just indecent. Why was this happening to him?)\n\u00a0\nAfter stewing in frustration over his lack of social skills, Bucky decided that he didn\u2019t care about finding ease in his \u201crelationship\u201d with Steve and settled more comfortably into the silence. It wasn\u2019t that Bucky saw Steve as something bad entering his life- Steve was literally hired to make sure that Bucky didn\u2019t die or relapse (or worse, the back of his mind reminded him). No, Bucky was just used to handling things alone. Before all this, he was a private detective, and the strongest human relationship in his life (excluding his relationship with his sister) had been with the angry, alcoholic neighbor who he sometimes collaborated with on particularly difficult cases.\n\u00a0\nAnd now Bucky apparently had a husband. A really, really hot husband who was somehow both a complete dork and a terribly dangerous asset.\n\u00a0\nDid Bucky care if they were friendly beyond business? Not particularly. Bucky was a private detective. He was accustomed to bullshitting his way through situations. The truth was that a stable relationship seemed like an exhausting amount of work, and Bucky had more important things to worry about, such as trying not to relapse into a blank-slate assassin.\n\u00a0\nBucky sunk into a gloomy silence, taking almost angry sips from his coffee. He knew he had a good thousand-yard stare going for him, and maybe that was why Steve knocked his knee against Bucky\u2019s still-elevated leg. \u201cHey? You with me?\u201d he said softly.\n\u00a0\nBucky shifted his gaze to Steve, who was watching him seriously and a little bit nervously. Instead of saying anything relevant at all, Bucky said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to hate me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt the dinner thing tonight,\u201d Bucky explained in irritation, \u201cthat Sam invited us to. They\u2019re all going to hate me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve asked, sounding genuinely confused.\n\u00a0\nBucky rolled his eyes. \u201cWhere to begin? Fuck, Steve, you\u2019ve read my fucking file. You know how fucked up I am,\u201d Bucky snapped, voice coming out more bitter than he\u2019d intended.\n\u00a0\nSteve narrowed his eyes. \u201cStop.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe self-deprecation isn\u2019t doing anyone any favors.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my damn therapist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a therapist. You ditched her after the mandatory three sessions,\u201d Steve pointed out.\n\u00a0\nBucky scrambled to his feet. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said, hurt. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about what it\u2019s like in my head.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to lose time,\u201d Steve returned, crossing his arms.\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed roughly. \u201cHave you ever lost time and woken up with blood on your hands?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve didn\u2019t say anything, and Bucky was satisfied, however petty it was. \u201cThey won\u2019t hate you,\u201d Steve said tiredly, rubbing a hand across his face. For the first time, Bucky noticed the dark circles under Steve\u2019s eyes that were as pronounced as bruises. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain charm to just the right amount of grumpiness.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wanted to roll his eyes. He wasn\u2019t the charming type of grumpy, whatever that meant. He was the type of grumpy that lashed out just enough to damage. Exhibit A: current conversation. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve was starting to get frustrated, and Bucky waited anxiously to see what he\u2019d do when finally pushed too far. \u201cIf you never want to establish a connection with your neighbors, be as much of a jerk as you\u2019re being right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Then, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re stuck with me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to pretend to be a fun person to be around.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did fine with that yesterday afternoon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky closed his eyes, recalling the ease of their conversation and how much fun he\u2019d had just talking to Steve. Despair crashed into him, squeezing his heart tightly. Bucky was never going to find that ease- he wasn\u2019t even comfortable with himself, much less another person. Trying to ground himself, he attempted to remember exactly how long it had been since that conversation, but he couldn\u2019t. His throat tightened with panic, and he turned away, eyes searching for the time. Thirty-nine days, forty-three minutes, he thought, lip trembling involuntarily.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Bucky?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ignored the concern in Steve\u2019s voice, wrapping his arms around himself. It had been exactly thirty-nine days and forty-three minutes, and he was going to be fine, and he was free, and he wasn\u2019t about to hurt anyone if he could just get away from Steve and make sure.\n\u00a0\nBucky started to stalk out of the room, shuddering, but Steve grabbed his shoulder. Bucky flinched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked softly.\n\u00a0\nBucky whirled around and exploded, \u201cI can\u2019t remember when we stopped talking!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t- I don\u2019t know when we stopped talking yesterday,\u201d Bucky managed, breath hitching. He was furiously embarrassed immediately after the admission. It was a terribly small thing to be freaking out about, but if Bucky couldn\u2019t keep track of the time, it brought him a terrifying step closer to relapsing.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyebrows drew together, but he seemed to understand what Bucky needed at the moment. \u201cWhen did you get out of bed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c8:13,\u201d Bucky whispered. \u201cThirty-nine days exactly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded as if he understood. \u201cHow long ago did you go to bed?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky pressed his lips together and thought. \u201cFourteen hours and thirty-eight minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long has it been since-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cThirty-nine days and forty-five minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled hesitantly, and Bucky realized that he was still gripping his shoulder, fingers digging into Bucky\u2019s skin. \u201cSee? You\u2019ve been keeping track. You\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky deflated a little bit. \u201cBut-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know you went to bed like five minutes after we stopped talking. So, you\u2019re good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sagged within himself. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m being stupid. This is so stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing about this is stupid,\u201d Steve said gravely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLiar.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cLook, Buck, I fixate on shit like that too. It\u2019s not stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean you obsessively keep track of the time?\u201d Bucky asked bitterly, shaking off Steve\u2019s grip and taking a step back.\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head and was quiet for a moment. \u201cI kind of obsessively clean. Um. I already completely took care of my room and the living room.\u201d Bucky glanced towards the living room and had to do a double take. It looked flawless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bucky said with a sigh. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve was staring at his feet and shifting his weight, looking increasingly uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m going to straighten up the kitchen,\u201d he mumbled, shrinking within himself as if he thought Bucky was going to laugh at him.\n\u00a0\nBucky just nodded tiredly. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to shower.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was eating a bagel for lunch and watching curiously/warily as Steve scrubbed at a scratch in the floorboards.\n\u00a0\nThey hadn\u2019t spoken since Bucky\u2019s freak-out, and the silence was actually kind of nice and companionable. It was different, but nice.\n\u00a0\nSteve broke the silence when he said distractedly, \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed boundaries.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky offered a noncommittal hum around his mouthful of bagel.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith PDA and shit. We should probably discuss that before we go over to Sam\u2019s.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, decent people don\u2019t make out in front of people they\u2019ve just met, so I don\u2019t really see much of an issue,\u201d Bucky said after he swallowed his bite.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d Steve said, sitting back on his heels and looking rather flustered. \u201cAre we gonna be a naturally handsy couple? Shy newlyweds? Annoyingly enamored? The possibilities are kind of overwhelming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWon\u2019t that stuff just come to us naturally?\u201d Bucky asked. \u201cAnd couldn\u2019t it be a combination of some of those things?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Steve said easily, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want one of us to panic if something ends up awkward. I\u2019m here to keep you safe, and if your neighbors think there\u2019s something up, I won\u2019t be doing my job.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wrinkled his nose. \u201cThen what do you want to do? Roleplay? That\u2019s kinky of you, Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve ignored the jibe. \u201cWe could act it out. How long do we have until we have to be at Sam\u2019s?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced at the clock. \u201cSix hours and thirty-four minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could go into town and walk around to just... test things out around other people.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked. \u201cWhile that is a great idea, I don\u2019t know how well I\u2019m gonna do in a place with a lot of other people.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips curled into a humorless smile. \u201cBucky, I\u2019m here to protect in all its forms. Whether it be protecting you from criminal organizations, protecting you from yourself, or protecting other people from you. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky felt himself relax a little bit. \u201cIf I snap, you\u2019ll stop me? Make sure I don\u2019t hurt anybody else?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn my honor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded, getting to his feet. \u201cAlright, then. I could use a few things to liven up the place anyways.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve drove them into town using the unremarkable gray sedan that the agency had left with Bucky.\n\u00a0\nThe nondescript downtown held about four restaurants and ten small stores around a cozy block. Bucky kind of hated how different it was from Brooklyn. Steve parked along the curb and turned to Bucky. \u201cWhat do you want to try first?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged, eyes sweeping the area. \u201cWe could go to that antiques shop and see if they have a record player or something. I didn\u2019t get to bring mine with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI meant which type of couple, but that works too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned, thinking for a moment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just let it happen?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve considered. \u201cFine. But if it backfires into something completely uncoordinated, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re too picky, Stevie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce inside the antiques store, Bucky took note of the people inside. There was a bored teenager running the cash register, a middle-aged mom examining some statues, and an old man looking nostalgically at baseball cards. Bucky hunched his shoulders and let his hair fall in front of his face almost subconsciously.\n\u00a0\nSteve must\u2019ve noticed because he put his hand on the small of Bucky\u2019s back. The light pressure was surprisingly pleasant, and Bucky caught himself leaning into it. \u201cYou good?\u201d Steve whispered, leaning down a little bit.\n\u00a0\nBucky let out a puff of air. \u201cRecord players.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey found a display showcasing three of them, and Bucky immediately started examining the cheapest one while Steve wandered to look at the music they had. They approached the counter with the record player and three albums that Steve had wordlessly chosen and Bucky had wordlessly accepted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d you find everything today?\u201d the teenager asked. Bucky glanced at his nametag: Eli.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Steve said, flashing a smile as Bucky took out his government-issued credit card. Then, he experimentally leaned into Steve\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\nWhich was...\n\u00a0\nSteve was all solid warmth against him, and Bucky couldn\u2019t remember the last time any warmth had thawed through his skin. Steve smiled down at him and shifted to wrap his arm around Bucky\u2019s shoulders.\n\u00a0\nIn conclusion: yes.\n\u00a0\nBucky tried not to show how flustered he was from this small amount of contact, but he probably failed as he signed Buchanan Rogers in a nearly indecipherable script and Eli handed him his stuff. Bucky unplastered himself from Steve\u2019s side and took the record player, happy to have something he wanted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave a great day,\u201d Eli said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Bucky and Steve said at the same time, although Steve sounded a lot more genuine.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was good,\u201d Bucky said as they exited the store.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe casual touching?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky felt his face go hot and prayed Steve wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cUm. Yeah. That was nice.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve bumped their shoulders together. \u201cAlright. We can do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was easy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve snorted, and Bucky smirked, immediately loving that he\u2019d caused that reaction. \u201cWe still have to figure out the verbal half.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve gave him a sideways look. \u201cThere are different kinds of ways to show love through speaking. Have you ever watched Merlin?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cYou had time to watch five seasons of medieval gay wizardry, but you didn\u2019t have time to watch Star Wars?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve blushed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, a note of defiance in his tone.\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed in defeat. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve watched Merlin. Go on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Arthur and Merlin were totally in love, but they showed it through bickering and teasing and shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd have you seen Parks and Rec?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat show has seven seasons. You\u2019re telling me you had time for that too, but no Star Wars?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s always time for Parks and Rec,\u201d Steve argued defensively.\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve seen most of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Leslie and Ben are super supportive and cute, but April and Andy are really weird and adorable, but nobody can argue against the love there. Point is, different couples show love in different ways.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, we have to figure out how we\u2019re going to be,\u201d Steve concluded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019re we gonna do that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve lifted a shoulder. \u201cThis would be easier if we had an objective third-party.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could just ask somebody random if we seem like an authentic couple?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve ran a hand through his hair. \u201cNo, that could backfire and end up compromising us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just wing it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve gave him a look. \u201cNo offense, Buck, but your behavior is kinda unpredictable. We\u2019ve gotta prepare somehow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA crease appeared between Bucky\u2019s brows as he considered the man before him. \u201cWow... You\u2019re kinda bossy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve ducked his head, a blush spreading across his features. \u201cUh-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to respond to that,\u201d Bucky said, playing with the sleeve of his shirt as he watched families meander down the street. \u201cBut, Stevie. I think you\u2019re massively underestimating me. I\u2019m a private detective-\u201c Steve made a hushing noise as a couple walked past, \u201c-and I\u2019ve pretty much bullshitted my way through eighty-eight percent of my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve been honest for twelve percent of your life?\u201d he asked incredulously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, could be worse, you punk. Point is, I can pretend to be charming and in love if I have to.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve leaned back on a lamppost, crossing his arms. \u201cProve it,\u201d he said, tilting his chin upwards.\n\u00a0\nBucky smothered a smirk. \u201cYou sure you wanna go there, Rogers?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re married, Buck. I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky took the cue, sauntering over to the lamppost until there was only a breath of space between their chests. He teasingly slid a hand from Steve\u2019s abdomen up to his pecks. He looked up so that their lips were barely a centimeter part. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he murmured lowly, eyes sparkling.\n\u00a0\nSteve swallowed heavily. \u201cYou can do better than that. More romance, less seduction.\u201d And was it just Bucky\u2019s imagination or did Steve\u2019s voice sound a little husky?\n\u00a0\n\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky whispered, making a tsking noise. He leaned forward, tracing his nose along Steve\u2019s jawline. \u201cDesire is just as authentic as love.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Steve murmured lowly, his hand absentmindedly coming to clutch at the back of Bucky\u2019s shirt.\n\u00a0\nBucky leaned back, taking in the sight of Steve\u2019s flushed face, considering his next move. \u201cThe first time I saw you, my heart stopped beating. I\u2019d never seen anyone so beautiful,\u201d Bucky said, not breaking eye contact as his other hand came to rest on the side of Steve\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed happily, eyes fluttering shut for a moment. \u201cTell me more?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be some sort of pretentious all-American dick, but you turned out to be so much better- so much more. I haven\u2019t even begun to figure it out yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? You plan to try?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smirked. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve stared at him, lips curling into a tiny smile. Bucky stepped away smugly, ignoring the rush of cold that assaulted his limbs as the contact disappeared. \u201cTold you I can bullshit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked away, clearing his throat. \u201cThat you can.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky whacked Steve\u2019s arm playfully. \u201cSee? We\u2019ll be totally fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled at him, but the expression didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky went to buy a picture frame for their marriage certificate before Steve drove them back home and they started getting ready for dinner at Sam\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nBucky started to pace after he\u2019d framed the certificate and set up the record player, but Steve stopped him, grabbing his arm and squeezing lightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky let out a breath he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been holding.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSam warmly welcomed them into his house. \u201cHey, guys! Clint and Natasha are already here. We\u2019re just waiting on Tony, but that\u2019s nothing new. Come on in- I\u2019ll introduce y'all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve and Bucky followed Sam into a spacious open floor area that contained the kitchen and family room. Sam was cooking something that smelled absolutely heavenly, but Bucky pushed that note aside in favor of examining the two people sitting on the couch.\n\u00a0\nThe woman was sitting elegantly in the man\u2019s lap, red hair curling tastefully around her face. Her skin was porcelain-pale, her eyes green and sparkling with intelligence. The man whose lap she was sitting on looked like the term \u201cscruffy\u201d personified. Uneven stubble dotted his face, his blonde hair was a mess, and he looked like he\u2019d had his nose recently broken.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve, Bucky, this is Natasha and Clint.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get our cookies?\u201d Clint asked, straightening a little bit, eyes lighting up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bucky said the same time that Steve said, \u201cCookies?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky gave Steve a sheepish look. \u201cThey dropped cookies on our doorstep, but I ate them all before you got here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTasha, oh my god, they liked my cookies,\u201d Clint whispered excitedly to Natasha.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018your cookies\u2019?\u201d Natasha asked bemusedly. \u201cYou bought them from the bakery.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, they were delicious,\u201d Bucky said. When both Natasha and Clint looked at him at the same time, Bucky tensed and tucked himself into Steve\u2019s side, trying not to visibly shrink under their gazes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Bucky,\u201d Clint said smugly, jabbing Natasha in the ribs.\n\u00a0\nNatasha was studying him curiously. \u201cWhat kind of name is \u2018Bucky\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned, and Steve gave his shoulders a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s a nickname. I mean, my real name is Buchanan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha arched an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018Bucky\u2019 kind of a weird stretch from \u2018Buchanan\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky hunched his shoulders while Sam said, \u201cNat, be nice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s just giving you a hard time, bro,\u201d Clint said.\n\u00a0\nNatasha shrugged, rising gracefully to her feet. \u201cOr am I?\u201d she muttered darkly, but there was a trace of a smile on her lips. She walked over to them and stuck out her hand. \u201cGlad to finally meet you two. And, in case there was any dispute, Clint and I are your best neighbors,\u201d she said as she shook their hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI resent that,\u201d Sam said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find some sort of balance,\u201d Steve said wryly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope,\u201d Clint piped up. \u201cIt\u2019s already decided. Nat and I win indefinitely.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to your nose?\u201d Bucky asked him, unable to quell his curiosity.\n\u00a0\nClint gave a lopsided grin. \u201cI got punched.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was badass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha leaned forward and whispered theatrically, \u201cHe punched himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint frowned. \u201cI distinctly remember the punching, and it was not self-inflicted.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make himself look cool.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNaaaaaaat,\u201d Clint whined.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCliiiiiiiiiint,\u201d Natasha whined back mockingly.\n\u00a0\nBucky was chuckling to himself by the time Clint heaved to his feet and made his way to Natasha with these wide, puppy-dog eyes. \u201cIdiot,\u201d Natasha muttered fondly before punching him lightly on the bicep.\n\u00a0\nBucky heard the front door open loudly and felt Steve stiffen against him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably-\u201c Sam started, but was cut off with a, \u201cTONY STARK IS IN THE BUILDING!\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced up at Steve to find his jaw set, eyes sharp with alertness. Bucky grabbed Steve\u2019s hand and laced their fingers together. Steve glanced down at him, and Bucky murmured, \u201cWe\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded, visibly deflating as the guy who was always wearing sunglasses stepped into the room. Said sunglasses were currently perched delicately on his spiky hair. When Tony saw Steve and Bucky, he stopped in the doorway so that Sam bumped into his back. Not noticing, he offered a rakish grin. \u201cNew neighbors?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, this is Steve and Bucky,\u201d Sam supplied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you know who I am,\u201d Tony said, finally stepping into the room so that Sam had room to walk around him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you always wear sunglasses?\u201d Bucky asked, shifting his weight restlessly.\n\u00a0\nTony gave him a calculating look. \u201cYou been watching me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cSo what if I have?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony beamed. \u201cI like you. Which one is he? Steve or Bucky?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, cool. That\u2019s a weird fucking name-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Natasha grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201c-and it embarrasses me to say it. Got any other nicknames, sweetheart?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shot a helpless glance at Steve. Steve just rolled his eyes and lifted a shoulder, so Bucky turned back to Tony and deadpanned, \u201cThat\u2019s a third date kind of question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony snickered. \u201cOld fashioned, are we?\u201d Before Bucky could say anything, Tony turned to Steve and blinked. \u201cShit. What percentage of your weight is muscle mass?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve glanced down at his admittedly tight shirt. \u201cUm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s like over seventy percent. Hot damn. Buckaroo, you gotta give me a high five for scoring that piece of ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looked at Steve\u2019s blush in amusement before obliging Tony\u2019s high five, but not without a warning, \u201cDon\u2019t objectify my husband.\u201d Tony looked mock offended.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys wanna migrate back to the couches?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know about y'all, but I don\u2019t really want to stand around all night.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter they\u2019d settled into the cushions (Steve\u2019s thigh pressed against Bucky\u2019s and the amount of warmth was borderline ridiculous), a small silence stretched forth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Steve-and-Bucky,\u201d Natasha said, leaning forward to brace her elbows on her knees, \u201chow did you two meet?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smirked and Steve let out a huff that might have passed as a laugh, both prepared with the story they\u2019d worked out. \u201cSteve knocked into me and spilled his coffee all over me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLukewarm coffee,\u201d Steve added hastily.\n\u00a0\nBucky waved a dismissive hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m an angry Brooklynite at heart, so I probably cursed at him enough to scandalize a sailor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI disagree with that,\u201d Steve said. \u201cHe mostly just looked defeated.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn my defense, it was a hard week at work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged, swaying so that their shoulders pressed together. \u201cI barely heard anything Bucky was saying. I was kind of distracted-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201c-by the way my shirt was sticking to my skin,\u201d Bucky finished smugly. \u201cInstead of just apologizing like a normal person, Steve offered to buy me a new outfit and take me out for dinner. I agreed to the dinner but not to the outfit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd the rest is history.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha leaned back, seemingly satisfied. \u201cDumbasses,\u201d was all she said, though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s more romantic than how you and Barton met,\u201d Tony interjected.\n\u00a0\nClint looked highly offended. \u201cWhat the fuck, man? Nat and I have been adorable from the start.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha raised an eyebrow. \u201cClint, you thought I was in the Russian mob.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint frowned. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m still not convinced that you aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha sighed heavily, but her lips started to curl mockingly. \u201cIt really is the only explanation for why I married you. I\u2019m obviously a sleeper agent.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony laughed. \u201cOne day, somebody\u2019s gonna say \u2018Rutabaga\u2019 or some shit, and you\u2019re gonna wake up screaming.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha pointed at Tony in affirmation.\n\u00a0\nClint scowled. \u201cFine. I want a divorce so I can marry Sam instead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam pumped his fist in triumph while Natasha grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got something going on the side?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were gonna tell you, Nat, we swear,\u201d Sam said with faux-solemnity.\n\u00a0\nClint scooted over on the couch so that he was draped over Sam\u2019s lap, dramatically batting his eyelashes. \u201cAt least Sam appreciates my bird obsession.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou and your fuckin\u2019 birds,\u201d Natasha scoffed.\n\u00a0\nClint looked at Steve and Bucky gravely. \u201cThis is what I have to deal with.\u201d Sam stroked a hand through Clint\u2019s hair consolingly, and Clint smirked pointedly in Natasha\u2019s direction. Natasha stuck her tongue out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs much as I love to watch your weird foreplay, I\u2019m sure new-neighbors aren\u2019t enjoying themselves as much as I am,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you, Stark,\u201d Clint whined.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe does have a point, though,\u201d Sam said, shooting an apologetic glance towards Steve and Bucky. \u201cI probably should\u2019ve warned you about how weird the squad is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, smiling faintly. \u201cWeird\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat brings you two to the suburbs anyway?\u201d Tony asked distractedly, examining his cuticles.\n\u00a0\nBucky studiously examined the stitch of his jeans, and there was a pause of hesitation before Steve answered. \u201cWe needed a break from the city for a little while. We\u2019re both sort of trying to figure ourselves out, and we decided a change of pace could be what we need.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI respect that,\u201d Clint said from where he was still lounging across Sam\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what do you guys do for a living?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a freelance illustrator,\u201d Steve answered, and Bucky carefully kept the surprise off his face. He\u2019d expected Steve\u2019s cover to be security work or some shit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Buckeye the Rabbit?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI consult for the government,\u201d Bucky said, glad to fall back on Fury\u2019s careful instruction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShady,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cI like it.\u201d Bucky saluted her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d Steve asked politely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI own a gym where we teach self defense, mixed martial arts, and ballet,\u201d Natasha said.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked in surprise. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou boys want lessons?\u201d she asked, eyes sparkling with mirth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cActually, we both have professional combat training,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\nNatasha shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have nothing to learn, but suit yourselves.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI teach a kindergarteners down at the local elementary school,\u201d Clint said, suddenly looking almost serious.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not expect that,\u201d Bucky admitted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a very misleading individual,\u201d Clint stage-whispered with a wink. \u201cI\u2019m an enigma.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky snorted, ducking his head towards Steve\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a therapist at the VA,\u201d Sam told them, letting his hand wander to rest on Clint\u2019s chest as Clint played with Sam\u2019s fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s awesome,\u201d Bucky said, purposefully ignoring the sudden tension in Steve\u2019s muscles.\n\u00a0\nTony waved a dismissive hand. \u201cSam tries too hard to put up an angelic front, and I am convinced he\u2019s secretly a terrible person.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam just grinned, wiggling his eyebrows. \u201cMaybe I am, Stark. Maybe I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m between things right now,\u201d Tony said, \u201cbut I dabble in robotic engineering. And mechanical engineering. And computer engineering. And-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you like a secret genius?\u201d Bucky blurted out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot so secret, Buckaneer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned at Tony. \u201cYou know, making up even more ridiculous nicknames should make you more embarrassed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m charming. Squad, tell Brooklyn 9-9 that I\u2019m charming.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha sat up straighter. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThings were almost astonishingly comfortable after that. Thanks mostly to Tony, there was never a lapse in conversation, and they mostly told dumb stories about events from the week. By the end of the night, Bucky knew that one of Sam\u2019s clients was getting married in Hawaii, one of the kids at Natasha\u2019s studio had gotten a small part in a Broadway show, one of Tony\u2019s robots (named Dum-E) had started a moderate fire in Tony\u2019s basement, and that Clint had gotten punched because he\u2019d confronted one of his kindergartener\u2019s parents about some suspicious bruising.\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t talk much. Any stories he shared were vague and pointless. But Steve talked even less- the only contributions he made were hilariously timed sarcastic comments that had Clint doubled over in laughter and Tony slapping him delightedly on the back. Bucky wondered absently if Steve wasn\u2019t talking because he was afraid of blowing their cover or if he just didn\u2019t have any good stories.\n\u00a0\nThe thought was too depressing to dwell on for more than a passing instant.\n\u00a0\nBut Sam\u2019s cooking was to die for.\n\u00a0\nBucky may be able to survive without Maria\u2019s bagels every day if he could just charm Sam into cooking for them regularly.\n\u00a0\nWhen he and Steve left for the night, it was with happy smiles and stomachs full of warm food. As they bid everyone farewell, and Sam shut the door behind them, Steve and Bucky turned to each other with matching grins.\n\u00a0\nThey reached out for a high five at the same time, slapping their hands together with a satisfying noise. \u201cThat went so well,\u201d Steve said excitedly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that went so well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you do this often?\u201d Bucky asked happily as they made their way back to their house. \u201cAren\u2019t you a secret agent?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Steve said, shrugging. \u201cThis is only my second undercover gig.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky faltered in surprise. \u201cThen what the hell did you do before?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked a little bit uncomfortable. \u201cThe term they gave me was \u2018terrorism control.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat sounds... ominous.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd super classified,\u201d Steve added, giving Bucky a look as they walked inside their house, \u201cso don\u2019t hope for any details.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cBut why the sudden shift to undercover work?\u201d he asked, unable to quell his curiosity.\n\u00a0\nSteve bit his lip, leaning against the counter as Bucky flipped on the lights. \u201cI think they want me to take over the agency one day, and they want me well-versed in all the areas of specialization.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky paused. \u201cSo you\u2019re like a really big deal, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve made a vague noise. \u201cDepends on who you ask.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m asking you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled sadly. \u201cThen, no. I\u2019m not a big deal.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky debated asking about the whole \u201cdangerous\u201d comment from last night, but he thought better of it. They hardly knew each other, and Steve didn\u2019t owe Bucky anything. Plus, Bucky kind of didn\u2019t want to know yet.\n\u00a0\nSo, he changed the topic instead. \u201cDid you like them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve didn\u2019t seem surprised by the abrupt shift. \u201cYeah. They\u2019re good people.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Sam say he was married?\u201d Bucky wondered aloud. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone else at his house since I\u2019ve gotten here. What do you think is up with that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Steve said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re on a business trip.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you like them?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nudged Bucky with his toe. \u201cDid you like them?\u201d he repeated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Yeah, I did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll be good for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to become a recluse at twenty-eight.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ignored the comment, eyes wandering to rest on the pile of envelopes on the counter. \u201cShit. We forgot to give Tony the letters.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can drop them at his place tomorrow,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI mean, we are neighbors.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright. Sounds like a good plan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey lapsed into silence as Bucky checked in with the time. It had been thirty-nine days, fourteen hours, and twenty minutes. And Bucky was okay. Bucky was fine. And Steve was here to make sure he didn\u2019t hurt anybody.\n\u00a0\nTomorrow would mark forty days, and Bucky wondered if he\u2019d ever move past this- if some day he would be able to look at a clock without searching for a specific moment.\n\u00a0\nBucky wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to know the answer to that either.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky knocked on Tony\u2019s door with no small amount of trepidation.\n\u00a0\nSteve was still on his run or whatever by the time Bucky had dragged himself out of bed. Bucky had stared at the neat stack of envelopes for twelve minutes before thinking, Fuck it, and making his way to Tony\u2019s too-big house.\n\u00a0\nThe door swung open, and Tony barely blinked before he was grabbing Bucky by the shoulders and yanking him inside, muttering, \u201cThank god, I need a test subject.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stiffened at the words, but Tony kept shoving him further into the house until he was standing in front of a blank wall. Tony stood back, looking Bucky over critically. \u201cRelax your stance- feet shoulder width apart, hands at your sides. Okay, great. Now, stand still.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky could only mutely follow Tony\u2019s instructions as the man hastily whirled around. He brought his hand into the air, and a blueish projection appeared. Bucky made a noise of surprise, which Tony either didn\u2019t hear or ignored.\n\u00a0\nTony moved around images with his hands until he seemed to come across a file of sorts that he was looking for. He tapped it, and the projection moved to encase Bucky\u2019s body. \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d he screeched as the light conformed to his body, almost like armor.\n\u00a0\nTony frowned, narrowing his eyes speculatively. \u201cInteresting. Jarvis, fit me with my stuff too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho the fuck are you talking to?\u201d Bucky asked, irritated now.\n\u00a0\nTony continued to ignore him as a disembodied voice said, \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky flinched. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMore projections surrounded Tony\u2019s body in the same sort of armor. Tony finally looked at Bucky and actually saw him, lips lifting into a mischievous smile. \u201cSith or jedi?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve watched Star Wars, right?\u201d Tony asked, almost exasperated. \u201cDo you want to be sith or jedi? Have you ever taken a buzzfeed quiz to figure out which side you\u2019d be on?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean... yeah?\u201d Bucky said, helplessly confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood. Then, which?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSith?\u201d Bucky said hesitantly, even though he liked to think he was most similar to Han Solo.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat makes this so much easier, thank god.\u201d Tony looked at the ceiling. \u201cEngage the simulation, J.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery well, sir,\u201d the disembodied voice said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, but who is-\u201c\n\u00a0\nBucky cut himself off as more projections appeared. He lifted his hand in surprise to see the red lightsaber he was holding.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he murmured.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a wet dream, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tony asked bemusedly. When Bucky looked up, he saw that Tony was holding the projection of a blue lightsaber. His expression turned expectant. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky couldn\u2019t help but grin as he lowered his voice as best as he could. \u201cI have you now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony beamed, raising his lightsaber. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky raised his own lightsaber, and after a slight pause, they moved forward at the same time, slashing their lightsabers towards each other. When they collided, they made the exact noise that Bucky had expected. \u201cThis is insane!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRiiiiight?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey twirled around each other with playful jabs of the lightsabers. Bucky tried to compose himself into actually playing the role of a sith lord. \u201cJoin me, Stark,\u201d he said, pressing forward so that the lightsabers came very close to Tony\u2019s face before Tony managed to deflect the blades. \u201cTogether we can rule the galaxy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony swung around, and Bucky barely blocked the saber. \u201cI\u2019ll never join you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nExperimentally, Bucky backed away and lifted his hand in imitation of the force chokehold. To his utter delight, Tony\u2019s armor lifted him off the ground, and Tony mimed choking as he made these ridiculous gagging noises.\n\u00a0\nBucky approached him, lightsaber at the ready. \u201cWe\u2019re not so different, you and I.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony continued pretending to choke as he spat, \u201cI\u2019m nothing like you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky finally released Tony from the chokehold, and Tony flung out his arm. To Bucky\u2019s shock, he was actually thrown across the room. He landed on his back with an oomf!, and when he looked up, Tony had his lightsaber pointed lethally at Bucky\u2019s throat. He smirked. \u201cJedis always win, dude.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony offered a hand, and Bucky pulled himself to his feet, still smiling. \u201cEh, whatever. The sith has more fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony stuck his tongue out before he shouted at the ceiling, \u201cJ, play the cantina music on loop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSure enough, the song started to resound throughout the house, and Bucky burst into laughter. \u201cThis is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d he declared.\n\u00a0\nTony shrugged, but Bucky could tell he was pleased. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of free time to design meaningless shit like this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not meaningless to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony gave Bucky an odd look, but it passed after a moment. \u201cI forgot you came here of your own free will. What\u2019s up, Buckster? Also, what\u2019s your full name? I need more nickname fodder.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky rolled his eyes, secretly happy at the teasing. \u201cIt\u2019s Buchanan. Buchanan Rogers.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes lit up as he visibly started to make up new nicknames in his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to drop off some letters that were addressed to Bruce Banner. Sam said you might want them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe smile dropped off Tony\u2019s face so quickly than Bucky wondered if it was ever there in the first place. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, sounding like he\u2019d been punched in the throat.\n\u00a0\nBucky reached to where he\u2019d stuffed the envelopes in the pouch of his sweatshirt, handing them to Tony. He watched as Tony ran his fingers over the address. There was definitely a story there.\n\u00a0\nBucky was debating whether or not he wanted to risk asking about it before he saw the change in Tony\u2019s face. Something in his eyes faded and hardened so that it looked almost casual as he tossed to envelops carelessly on a nearby table. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep those around in case he ever comes back,\u201d Tony said with feigned lightness. \u201cThanks, Buchananball.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky gave him an unimpressed look.\n\u00a0\nTony started to grin. \u201cGet it? Like Buchanan and cannonball?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI understood the first time,\u201d Bucky deadpanned.\n\u00a0\nTony actually giggled, and Bucky resisted the urge to sigh in defeat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI should head back home. Steve\u2019s probably back from his run by now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s giggles increased in intensity. \u201cDid you know-\u201c he gasped, \u201c-that Angie thinks he\u2019s hot? An old married lesbian woman thinks your husband is hot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t blame her. You\u2019d have to be blind not to think so,\u201d Bucky said candidly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would totally bang your husband,\u201d Tony added, calming down with extreme effort. \u201cLike, anywhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAaaaaand you ruined the whole thing,\u201d Bucky grumbled sarcastically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Rogers. I\u2019d bang you too,\u201d Tony said, patting Bucky consolingly on the shoulder. \u201cAnd not to discredit your hotness or anything, but how did you manage to score the literal Adonis?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scowled, although there was no heat to it. \u201cFuck you. Steve thinks I\u2019m charming and shit,\u201d he said indignantly.\n\u00a0\nTony nodded. \u201cIn your own way,\u201d he said, considering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe fuck you mean by that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re like a pissy raccoon. It\u2019s kind of adorable.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glared. \u201cI\u2019m not adorable. I\u2019m dangerous.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony just laughed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a Star Wars geek.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re still holding your lightsaber.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky raised the weapon menacingly. \u201cDon\u2019t make me use the force again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that a threat, Darth Rogers?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt sure is, Master Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe music abruptly shifted from the cantina theme to the imperial march. Bucky didn\u2019t bother to stop the pathetic noise of excitement that he made. Tony looked at the ceiling fondly. \u201cThanks, J.\u201d And then they were off again, pretending they knew how to duel with lightsabers and shouting random lines from the movies that made no sense in their context but made them laugh all the same.\n\u00a0\nBucky finally cornered Tony in his kitchen, lightsaber pointed at Tony\u2019s heart and hand raised in threat of the chokehold. \u201cYou fool,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou really thought you stood a chance?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony smirked and suddenly shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a TRAP!\u201d before he somehow navigated himself out of the corner and slashed down with his lightsaber.\n\u00a0\nThe projection went through Bucky\u2019s abdomen, and Bucky suppressed his laughter as he heavily collapsed to his knees, clutching at the handle of Tony\u2019s lightsaber.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d he pretended to gasp, \u201cI am your father.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d Tony shouted theatrically.\n\u00a0\nThey collapsed into laughter, both of them sinking completely to the floor as the simulation faded, making the armor and lightsabers disappear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMan,\u201d Tony breathed, \u201cyou made that so much more fun than anyone else. Nat takes it too seriously and always beats me up. Clint usually falls over himself and stabs himself with the lightsaber. And Sam always worries he\u2019s gonna hurt me. Bro-chanan, we need to do this more often.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank god,\u201d Bucky said, relieved. \u201cThis was awesome, and you\u2019re going to have to explain how it works to me.\u201d Bucky glanced at his watch and felt his stomach twist. \u201cShit. Steve\u2019s probably worried. I didn\u2019t tell him I was coming over here.\u201d He clambered to his feet, worried that Steve was going to go full FBI mode if Bucky didn\u2019t get back to the house soon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAwwwww, he\u2019s overprotective,\u201d Tony crooned, batting his eyelashes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony winked and Bucky snorted.\n\u00a0\nAfter he finally left, Bucky hurried back to the house to find Steve aggressively cleaning the microwave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\nSteve jolted, straightening so fast that Bucky winced in sympathy for his back muscles. He whirled around, looking harried as he mumbled, \u201cSorry. Where were you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky cocked his head. \u201cDropping Bruce Banner\u2019s mail off at Tony\u2019s. We got distracted.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t ask. Bucky didn\u2019t explain, mostly because he knew he\u2019d get annoyed when Steve inevitably didn\u2019t appreciate the awesomeness behind Tony\u2019s simulation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was a little worried,\u201d Steve finally admitted, gesturing self-deprecatingly towards the microwave. \u201cHence the cleaning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Bucky murmured sheepishly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be gone that long.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Steve said earnestly. \u201cI didn\u2019t go into full panic mode, so all is well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow was your run?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled, eyes crinkling happily. \u201cIt was great. This morning I guess Sam was running at the same time, and I totally beat him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looked at him. \u201cStevie, running isn\u2019t a competition.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot with that attitude,\u201d Steve insisted stubbornly. \u201cSam seemed to have fun with it anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure getting passed and laughed at is a perfectly fun time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed softly. \u201cIt was funny,\u201d he insisted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re kind of an asshole,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cShould I be disturbed that this doesn\u2019t surprise me at all?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve just winked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI knew that boy scout aesthetic was just a front.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cI actually would hope that you wouldn\u2019t think of it as a \u2018boy scout\u2019 aesthetic. I have a few admittedly unpleasant things to say about boy scouts.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shook his head. \u201cAre you even real?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re homophobes, Buck,\u201d Steve said, crossing his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s the twenty-first century.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Bucky sighed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd just because-\u201c\n\u00a0\nBucky held up both hands in peace. \u201cWhoa, I\u2019m not trying to argue with you. You don\u2019t have to convince me or anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve let out a breath before ducking his head in embarrassment. \u201cAh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got strong opinions.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Steve said warningly. \u201cDon\u2019t speak too soon.\u201d But his eyes were sparkling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStevie, I will gladly listen to you rant about justice to the boy scouts,\u201d Bucky said, holding up his right hand as if taking an oath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s highly reassuring. I can go off on a lot of tangents.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky walked over to the refrigerator to find that its contents had been depleted to a half-finished beer, a single apple, and a small package of cheese. He groaned, letting his forehead thunk to rest on the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u00a0\nBucky turned around, kicking the refrigerator shut. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go to the grocery store. Or, I mean, I can go by myself or whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can come,\u201d Steve said with a hesitant smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to be strangers the whole time we\u2019re here. That\u2019d be awkward.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried to hide his relief. \u201cOh. That\u2019s- that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s smile brightened. Bucky decided that it was a good look on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrocery store?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded. \u201cGrocery store.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky glared contemptuously at the store-brand bagels.\n\u00a0\nSteve wandered towards him, holding a carton of milk. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what type of milk you like, so I just got 1%,\u201d Steve said, carefully placing it inside their cart. Then he seemed to notice Bucky\u2019s attention towards the bagels. \u201cUm. What are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re taunting me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe- the bagels?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky turned his glare on Steve. \u201cI only have two good ones left, Steve. They\u2019re laughing in my face. They know that as soon as I run out of the ones from Maria\u2019s Deli, I\u2019m going to have to deal with them,\u201d he said, jabbing a finger in the direction of the bagels.\n\u00a0\nSteve was trying not to smile. \u201cBuck, I could always take a day-trip to Brooklyn and grab you more bagels.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me, Steve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would never do that,\u201d Steve said with a faint, almost private, smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky sighed. \u201cHow are you even real? Screw knights in shining armor. I\u2019ll settle for blondes in tacky khakis any day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re not tacky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve bumped their shoulders together. \u201cWhat else do we need?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced at the half-full cart. \u201cEggs, ice cream, cookie dough, some more veggies, and probably some coffee things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably some pasta sauce too,\u201d Steve mused, dropping his chin onto Bucky\u2019s shoulder in a way that looked casual but felt very deliberate.\n\u00a0\nBucky batted him away, tossing a grin at him. \u201cKeep your hands to yourself, Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes as he drew away. \u201cIs this just because you don\u2019t want the bagels to know you\u2019re seeing someone else?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThose bagels can know whatever the hell they want. I\u2019m just trying to keep our focus centered on the mission.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe mission?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bucky said impatiently. \u201cStandard retrieval op.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smothered a laugh, playing along. \u201cPotential hostiles. Extraction imminent.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAffirmative. Time is of the essence.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey finished grocery shopping with remarkable efficiency. If there was a reward for efficient grocery shopping, it would totally go to Steve and Bucky. We make a good team, Bucky thought before he cringed at the dreamy tone of his internal monologue and tried to forget the thought had ever existed.\n\u00a0\nWhen they got back to the house, Steve went into his room to finish making himself at home. Bucky turned on the TV and started watching the show about weird houses that he was vigorously pretending he wasn\u2019t addicted to.\n\u00a0\nThe best part was that while he watched the dumb (thrilling) house show, he got to snack on a bag of cookies.\n\u00a0\nCookies were important to maintain temporary happiness.\n\u00a0\nMission: success.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d a man with an arctic smile asked as he blinked slowly.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Arctic Smile repeated impatiently.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he did not say anything, Arctic Smile hit him so hard that his teeth tore his mouth. He tasted blood. But he shook his head. His mind was a yawning chasm. He could not answer even if Arctic Smile was watching him intently.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYour name?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe shook his head. He did not know he had a sister.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nArctic Smile sat back, triumph flashing through his cold eyes. Then he leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You belong to me now. You are the Soldier. You are a patriot.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Soldier clung to the feeble sense of identity as soon as it was given. \u201cAnd?\u201d the Soldier said, and his voice was raw, as if he had been screaming.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd I have a mission for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nBucky startled awake with a pained gasp.\n\u00a0\nThe icy color Alexander Pierce\u2019s eyes stained his vision as he fumbled for his watch with shaking fingers. Bucky catalogued everything he\u2019d done for the past twenty-four hours. Lightsaber fighting with Tony. Grocery shopping with Steve. Dumb house show. Tentative dinner with Steve. More house show. Sleep.\n\u00a0\nIt had been forty days, seventeen hours, and fifty-four minutes.\n\u00a0\nBucky forced his muscles to tense and relax. When he still felt like his skin was crawling, he climbed out of bed with a sigh and padded quietly downstairs, remembering yesterday\u2019s genius purchase of ice cream.\n\u00a0\nHe stopped in his tracks when he saw Steve sitting on the floor with his back to the wall, positioned so that he could see the front door, the stairs, and the living room at the same time. He was looking at Bucky. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky licked his dry lips. \u201cHi,\u201d he whispered, hoping his voice sounded steady.\n\u00a0\nSteve deliberately turned his attention from Bucky to the gun in his lap. He started to slowly clean it, and Bucky finally allowed his feet to carry him into the kitchen to retrieve the ice cream with quavering movements.\n\u00a0\nBucky hesitantly walked towards Steve, clutching his spoon so tightly that his knuckles had turned white. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled humorlessly, the dark circles under his eyes more pronounced than ever. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe room went quiet, and Bucky gingerly sat down a few feet away from Steve, cradling the carton of ice cream in his lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNightmares?\u201d Steve finally asked.\n\u00a0\nBucky stilled until he found the courage to shoot a glance at Steve. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve huffed out a small breath. An extremely optimistic person could have compared that noise to an approximation of a laugh. But Bucky was not even slightly optimistic, and to him the noise sounded bitter and tired.\n\u00a0\nThey fell into the silence of suburbia at night.\n\u00a0\nSuburbia was haunting in comparison to Brooklyn. The quiet was jarring, the darkness was disorienting, the soft noises of nature were eerie, and the very air reminded Bucky of a hibernating bear. There was something about the atmosphere that was both oppressive and isolating.\n\u00a0\nBucky couldn\u2019t decide if he liked it or not, but the contrast made it even more difficult to relax at night than it would\u2019ve been.\n\u00a0\nBut as Steve cleaned his gun and Bucky ate his ice cream, the stillness felt appropriate.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Steve said quietly, not looking at Bucky, \u201cyou could always talk to me about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky arched an eyebrow. \u201cYeah. Likewise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked up sharply, eyes narrowed so that his expression clearly said, Not happening.\n\u00a0\nBucky tried for a smirk and probably failed. \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve watched Bucky for another moment before he turned back to his gun. \u201cFair enough. I guess I see your point.\u201d He tried for a smile that looked more like a grimace. \u201cBut I do not see your point in choosing that flavor of ice cream.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky gratefully latched onto the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s because you have no taste.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do I have no taste?\u201d Steve asked indignantly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cExhibit A,\u201d Bucky said, gesturing to Steve\u2019s pajama pants.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked down at his dinosaur pjs. \u201cThis was a gift from a friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even the dinosaurs that are the problem,\u201d Bucky said as if Steve had never replied. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that the background is a rainbow gradient.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be ironic.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI assumed that as a fake freelance illustrator-\u201c\n\u00a0\nSteve seemingly choked on his next breath of air and coughed. \u201cErm. I actually do have a portfolio for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stared at him. \u201cFor real?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI went to art school in my free time,\u201d Steve said quietly. \u201cIt was something to make me feel normal. It comes in handy for deep undercover missions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he was supposed to say, so he just went with, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me some of your stuff some time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve made a noncommittal noise, placing his gun on his thigh before he extracted another one that had evidently been wedged between his back and the wall. Bucky tried not to think about the potential dangers of that. \u201cYou got your degree in criminal psychology, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Useful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scoffed. \u201cSure did me a lot of use.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve leveled him with a look. \u201cBuck. You uncovered the criminal underground of New York City after a month of investigation. I\u2019d say that\u2019s very useful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glared, stabbing violently into his ice cream. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m just saying a lot of good came out of your investigation too. We have the upper hand thanks to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey still haven\u2019t caught anyone?\u201d Bucky asked, scared to hear the answer.\n\u00a0\nSteve pursed his lips. \u201cStill only Jasper Sitwell\u2019s body.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell. Can\u2019t get caught if you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve visibly shrank in on himself. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe go back to normal when they arrest Alexander Pierce, right?\u201d Bucky asked, twirling his spoon absently. \u201cYou go back to the agency and I go back home?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf there are no complications.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cComplications,\u201d he echoed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know that we don\u2019t usually do this, right? We usually let people adjust to witness protection independently.\u201d Bucky nodded slowly. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is because of the uncertain danger of the situation. It\u2019s likely that the criminal organization has the resources to find you again. Not only are we protecting you- we\u2019re also protecting everyone who could be hurt if you\u2019re captured again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cComplications,\u201d Bucky repeated numbly, staring at his lap.\n\u00a0\nSteve kept speaking in that clipped, clinical tone. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how far the organization\u2019s reach stretches. We know that they have the drug that impairs your memory. It may not just be Alexander Pierce who needs to be arrested to ensure your safety. There may be other individuals.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s hands were shaking again. Objectively, he knew this was a possibility. But he\u2019d been doing so well. His veins hadn\u2019t burned with need for weeks. The addiction had dwindled from a fervency to an ache. He couldn\u2019t go back- not after the bile and the shudders and the sweat and the delusions had ebbed away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky said, and his voice came out very quietly. \u201cPromise that if they come for me, you\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him steadily. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cI am not going back,\u201d he growled. \u201cI would rather die.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t let either of those things happen,\u201d Steve snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been protecting people my entire life, and I\u2019m not going to stop because of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019ll protect more people if you kill me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to take you back, so I won\u2019t have to even consider that option.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoddammit, Steve!\u201d Bucky shouted, voice hoarse. His fingers were digging into his thigh, and Steve had gone very still. \u201cJust promise me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips were pressed into a firm line, his body coiled tightly, like a predator laying in wait, or like a prisoner about to be sent to the electric chair. \u201cPromise you what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf they come to take me, and if you can\u2019t stop them,\u201d Bucky began with a snarl, \u201cshoot me in the fucking head.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey stared at each other for an indeterminate stretch of time, tense.\n\u00a0\nThen, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky told his hands to stop shaking.\n\u00a0\n(They didn\u2019t listen.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said again. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky let his head drop to hang between his shoulders. He took a deep, shuddering breath. He stared at his ice cream bowl. He\u2019d bent the spoon over the course of the conversation with how hard he\u2019d been clutching it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said softly, and Bucky forced himself not to stiffen when Steve\u2019s hand touched his shoulder. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky slumped forward, and Steve\u2019s hand stayed where it was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you- um- want a hug?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky pushed the bowl out of the way and, unable to speak, crawled towards Steve. Steve opened his arms, and Bucky fell into them. Steve felt solid and warm- Bucky wanted to cry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Steve was murmuring. \u201cI promise I promise I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bucky mumbled against Steve\u2019s chest. His fingers had curled into the fabric of Steve\u2019s shirt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry. Shouldn\u2019t have brought it up after a nightmare.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe worst part was that they weren\u2019t even nightmares- they were memories. Bucky must\u2019ve made a pitiful noise, because Steve made a hushing sound and pulled him closer.\n\u00a0\nSteve started running his hand up and down Bucky\u2019s back. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d he whispered.\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded against him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been hugged since two Christmases ago,\u201d he admitted honestly but immediately regretted it. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that out loud.\n\u00a0\nSteve stilled. \u201cLast hug I had was with my mom.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Bucky asked, suddenly not sure if Steve was just hugging him out of a weird sense of obligation to comfort regardless of his own boundaries. Because Steve seemed like the type of person who\u2019d do that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. This is. Yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky relaxed. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey stayed like that for what was probably too long to be socially acceptable. But fuck that. They were technically married. It didn\u2019t matter if they\u2019d only met roughly three days ago (less than that).\n\u00a0\nBucky was the one to pull back, running a hand through his tangled hair. \u201cHey, Stevie?\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled at him, and Bucky thought he saw a little bit of fondness there, but he was probably imagining things. \u201cYeah, Buck?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen do you want to watch Star Wars?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve was startled into a laugh.\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled, delighting in the reaction, but after a minute the smile faded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, seriously.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him. \u201cDo you want to show me Star Wars right now?\u201d he asked resignedly.\n\u00a0\nBucky clambered to his feet by way of answer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cEpisode V now?\u201d Bucky asked hopefully, making sure he was using his puppy eyes.\n\u00a0\nSteve stood, and his back muscles popped audibly. Bucky cringed. \u201cGimme a little bit of time to let it sink in first.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky pouted. \u201cThat means a lot later.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe we can do one a day?\u201d Steve suggested.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head. \u201cNo, Buck, no, the movie was great. It was. It\u2019s just content-heavy. It\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky eyed Steve skeptically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho was your favorite?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked offended to be even asked. \u201cPrincess Leia. Duh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMine\u2019s Han Solo,\u201d Bucky said, pacified for the moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno. Han and I are both ruggedly attractive men,\u201d Bucky replied with a shrug.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes had that glint of mischief again. \u201cYou\u2019re also both whiny drama queens.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked. \u201cI resent that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve just smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going for a run.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky made a derisive noise. \u201cThat\u2019ll kill you some day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRelax, you jerk. I won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure not to burn the house down in your absence,\u201d Bucky said dryly.\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed heavily, and Bucky had to bite down on a smile.\n\u00a0\nMaybe this wouldn\u2019t be as bad as he\u2019d initially thought.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was leafing through envelopes, leaning against the mailbox, when Clint and Natasha walked up to him, a large dog in tow.\n\u00a0\nClint was waving madly as if they weren\u2019t the only people on the street. \u201cHey! Hey, Bucky! Hey!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt a more normal volume, Natasha said, \u201cBuchanan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi,\u201d Bucky said as they approached, smiling and nodding in the direction of the dog. \u201cYou have a dog.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint frowned. \u201cNo we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky knelt down and scratched the dog\u2019s ears, inspecting the collar with a raised eyebrow. \u201cOh? So who named him Lucky and bought him a collar?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint blinked. \u201cMe?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo it\u2019s your dog.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. He just hangs around. I don\u2019t like to think of it as ownership.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced at Natasha, who looked vaguely bored. \u201cI think you\u2019re in denial,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\nLucky made a dog noise, and Bucky resumed petting him.\n\u00a0\nClint laughed. \u201cYou think this is bad? You should see Nat with her cat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a cat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee?\u201d Clint said, grinning. \u201cHer name is Liho and we love her very much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha lifted a shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s better company than you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLucky and Liho?\u201d Bucky asked bemusedly. \u201cThey get along?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe only thing Liho likes in this world is Nat,\u201d Clint said, rolling up his sleeve to show a scabbed area on his forearm that looked suspiciously like cat claws.\n\u00a0\nNatasha smiled. \u201cThat cat is good for one thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, come on, Tasha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d Natasha said, and her eyes were crinkled with happiness.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never know true fear until you remember Liho is in the room while you\u2019re having sex,\u201d Clint said solemnly to Bucky.\n\u00a0\nBucky cringed. \u201cToo much, Clint.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have a scar on my dick.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky was increasingly alarmed. \u201cPlease do not show me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint smiled widely, reaching for his waistband. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m deaf. Did you just say, \u2018Please show me\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky clapped his hands over his eyes while Natasha laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEh, you couldn\u2019t handle my dick anyway,\u201d Clint said dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019d leave Steve in a heartbeat, and I\u2019m only a home wrecker on workdays and special occasions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky rolled his eyes. \u201cI highly doubt you have anything on Steve\u2019s dick.\u201d (Not that Bucky had spent time thinking about Steve\u2019s dick or anything.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cWant me to get the measuring tape, boys? I\u2019ll watch,\u201d Natasha said, crossing her arms.\n\u00a0\nClint laughed, rocking back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019m always down for my wife watching dick contests.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I disagree,\u201d Natasha mused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Bucky?\u201d Clint said, suddenly looking excited. \u201cDo you think you could talk Steve into coming to my kindergarten class?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm. Why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s an illustrator. It may be cool. It\u2019s important to cultivate artistic development, especially at an early age,\u201d Clint explained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Steve\u2019s ever done something like that before. I can bring it up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint beamed. \u201cCool.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d Natasha cut in. \u201cWhat kind of combat training do you boys have? Just curious.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cUh. Martial arts for the both of us. Mostly self defense based for me and hand-to-hand based for Steve,\u201d Bucky said, glad that this was something he actually knew about Steve from their getting-to-know-you chat.\n\u00a0\nShe nodded consideringly. \u201cCool.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLucky barked, wagging his tale, and Clint\u2019s smile softened. \u201cYeah, okay, you attention whore.\u201d He looked up at Bucky. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d he said, batting his eyelashes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIgnore him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe next time I\u2019ll show you my dick,\u201d Clint added cheerfully.\n\u00a0\nBucky laughed. \u201cYeah, keep dreaming, dollface.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs he and Natasha walked away, Natasha reached out and laced their fingers together, Clint leaning down to whisper, \u201cHe called me dollface.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMore like bitch-face,\u201d Natasha teased. Clint laughed.\n\u00a0\nBucky looked away and headed back inside.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d Bucky announced, flopping dramatically onto the couch next to Steve, purposefully sprawling out in the most ridiculous way possible.\n\u00a0\nSteve ignored him in favor of continuing his sketch. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky sighed, \u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo go find something to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned, flinging his arms and legs out so that he smacked Steve in the chest and kicked his knee. When Steve didn\u2019t even blink, Bucky quieted down, watching the wrinkle between Steve\u2019s eyebrows as the pencil scratched against the paper. Steve paused to bite on the eraser and then continued. \u201cWhat\u2019re you drawing?\u201d Bucky asked.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes flicked up distractedly. \u201cYou.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get your hair right.\u201d He turned the sketchbook so that Bucky could see. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked at the drawing in shock. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? That looks exactly like me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve wrinkled his nose and shook his head, turning the sketchbook back around to rebalance on his knees. \u201cThe eyes aren\u2019t quite right and the hair needs work.\u201d Steve gestured vaguely in his direction. \u201cYour hair is sort of a combination between wavy, straight, and tangled. Very interesting, but hard to capture. And your eyes are too expressive to be as dead as they look here,\u201d Steve explained absentmindedly, barely paying attention to Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow. Somebody did his homework.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck off. I\u2019ve had to stare at you for the past week.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky let Steve work at the sketch for another fifteen minutes before he sighed loudly. \u201cCan we watch more Star Wars?\u201d He wasn\u2019t whining. He wasn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips curled. \u201cFine. Give me ten more minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky made a pleased noise, scrambling to set up the movie. Even though he knew Steve probably wasn\u2019t listening, he started saying, \u201cI\u2019m so excited. The Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest films ever made, in my humble opinion. Definitely the best of the franchise. The characters are amazing, and the plot really thickens, and the story just evolves in such a satisfying way. And, oh my god, the ending. I can\u2019t wait to see what you think. You may actually want to start Episode VI straight afterwards.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky knew he\u2019d been rambling- mostly to himself, if he was being honest. But he looked up to see Steve watching him with a fond smile. Bucky felt his cheeks heat as Steve said, \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a nerd.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet, pal. Wait \u2018til I make you watch Lord of the Rings.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve huffed a laugh, putting his sketchbook aside. \u201cJust start the damn movie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky grinned widely and finished setting up before he joined Steve on the couch, sitting so that they were almost touching. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs the movie played, Bucky realized that he wasn\u2019t wearing socks, and the house was cold enough to warrant discomfort. He frowned to himself, debating the course of action. He could run upstairs to grab a blanket or a pair of socks, but that would mean missing Han\u2019s rescue mission for Luke. Not worth it.\n\u00a0\nBut his toes were freezing.\n\u00a0\nBucky deliberately shifted so that he was sitting with his back against the arm of the couch. He lifted his feet to rest on the cushions and tried to warm his toes with his hands.\n\u00a0\nWhich didn\u2019t really work.\n\u00a0\nHis gaze came to rest on Steve, who always seemed to emanate warmth. The internal struggle that followed was probably melodramatic, but Bucky couldn\u2019t help but agonize over whether or not he should initiate contact.\n\u00a0\nHe blew out a frustrated breath and threw caution to the wind as he shoved his feet under Steve\u2019s thigh. Steve looked at him in surprise, but Bucky just scowled challengingly.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips quirked slightly, and he turned back to the movie. Bucky couldn\u2019t help but take it as a victory.\n\u00a0\nFeet warm and the rebel forces being attacked, Bucky sighed contentedly. He burrowed more comfortably into his position so that he was more slumped against the arm of the couch, feet anchored by Steve\u2019s muscular thigh.\n\u00a0\nJust as Luke was battling Darth Vader in one of the most iconic scenes in cinematographic history, the doorbell rang.\n\u00a0\nBucky and Steve made twin noises of disappointment, Bucky immediately jabbing the PAUSE button so that Steve wouldn\u2019t miss anything. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Bucky grumbled irritably.\n\u00a0\nSteve gave him a careful once-over and got to his feet with Bucky. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scoffed. \u201cRelax. I\u2019m not gonna fall back on murderous tendencies just because someone interrupted what is arguably the best scene in the entire world of cinema.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve did not look convinced. Bucky didn\u2019t really blame him.\n\u00a0\nBucky stomped to the door and threw it open, distinctly annoyed. Tony and Sam stood on the porch. Tony didn\u2019t even wait for acknowledgement before brushing past Bucky and walking inside, calling, \u201cLove what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam offered an apologetic look. \u201cHe was bored and insistent. I brought cookies as a consolation.\u201d He held up a tupperware container.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s eyes zeroed in on the cookies. \u201cDid you make those?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam shrugged. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s a hobby.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky opened the door wider. \u201cAny person with cookies is a person welcome in our home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve clapped Sam on the back as he came inside. \u201cBuck and I were just watching a movie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot a movie,\u201d Bucky declared dramatically. \u201cThe movie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam looked intrigued. \u201cAnd what would that-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK!\u201d Tony shrieked from the other room. Bucky turned to see him storm back into the foyer. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t invite me?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smirked at Tony. \u201cWell, we weren\u2019t only watching the movie,\u201d he said lowly.\n\u00a0\nTony blinked in surprise as Sam guffawed, but the expression quickly morphed into a sneer. \u201cWhy, Rogers. You sly dog.\u201d He turned to Bucky. \u201cPlease tell me you were roleplaying as Han and Leia.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam was grinning toothily, thrusting the cookies in their general direction. \u201cHere, take them. We\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut Saaaaaaaaaaam,\u201d Tony whined. \u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam gave him an unimpressed look. \u201cDude, there are plenty of other things to do. Come on- we can go make fun of that show about spies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony looked around dejectedly. \u201cCan\u2019t even stick around to watch them have super hot couch sex,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI miss Bruce. You guys are no fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam rolled his eyes, looking at Steve and Bucky as Tony stomped towards the door. \u201cFeel free to come over to my place after you finish your movie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve blushed, and Bucky\u2019s eyes tracked the spread of heat down Steve\u2019s neck. How far did that blush extend?\n\u00a0\n(Focus, Barnes.)\n\u00a0\n(*Rogers.)\n\u00a0\n(Shit. Having a new identity was hard.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for the cookies,\u201d Steve said earnestly, resolutely ignoring the innuendo in Sam\u2019s tone, even though he had been the one to insinuate anything in the first place.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo problem, man. I made like eighty,\u201d Sam said.\n\u00a0\nTony huffed. \u201cSam stress-bakes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam slapped Tony on the arm. \u201cAnyways.\u201d He cast Steve and Bucky another look. \u201cHope to see you later.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky said, letting them leave as quickly as they\u2019d entered.\n\u00a0\nBucky turned back to Steve, who was trying not to laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy the hell did you make them think we were having sex with Star Wars as a backdrop?\u201d Bucky asked incredulously.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cWell-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m more offended that anyone would think I\u2019d want to focus on something non-Star Wars related while Episode V was on, even if that thing is sex,\u201d Bucky groused.\n\u00a0\nSteve grinned. \u201cStar Wars trumps sex, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course it does!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head as if to say, Unbelievable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut seriously, why?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cI kinda just wanted to watch the movie with you. Bringing up sex made them leave fast.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried to hide the fact that he was floored that Steve wanted to spend time with him. \u201cI thought you liked them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do. I just want to spend time with you right now. They\u2019re available later.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looked at the floor, smothering a smile. \u201cGood,\u201d he mumbled faintly.\n\u00a0\nThey settled back into their previous position on the couch, Steve not even blinking when Bucky stuck his feet under his leg.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s reaction to the \u201cI am your father\u201d line was epic. His eyes widened in sudden understanding, a grin breaking across his features. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that somewhere before,\u201d he said sarcastically, and Bucky snorted despite himself.\n\u00a0\nBut Steve\u2019s favorite part was the \u201cI love you\u201d/\u201dI know\u201d moment. He actually let out a tragic coo at the scene, pouting adorably.\n\u00a0\nBucky decided he liked watching movies with Steve.\n\u00a0\nWhen the credits started to roll, Bucky was greeted with Steve\u2019s small but genuine smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEpisode VI?\u201d Bucky asked tentatively.\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed. \u201cAfter we hang out with Sam and Tony. But tonight, yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky counted it as a win.\n\u00a0\nBefore they left for Sam\u2019s house, Steve grabbed Bucky by the shoulders and regarded him speculatively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm?\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him in that analytical way for another moment before he refocused on Bucky. \u201cCan I give you a hickey?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s jaw actually dropped. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve colored a little bit, but raised his chin with defiance. \u201cThey think we were just having sex. I think a hickey would be appropriate to sell the idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do I have to be the one with the hickey?\u201d Bucky asked. He couldn\u2019t believe this was an actual conversation he was having.\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned to himself. \u201cYou know how I was experimented on?\u201d Bucky nodded. \u201cI told you there were side effects. I don\u2019t really bruise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bucky said, feeling a little bit dumb.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say yes,\u201d Steve assured him.\n\u00a0\nBut now Bucky was taking it as a challenge. He met Steve\u2019s gaze with determination. \u201cTo hell with it. We\u2019re married and shit. Give me a hickey.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled a little bit. \u201cAlright. Here goes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere goes,\u201d Bucky echoed, tipping his head back to give Steve access to his neck.\n\u00a0\nSteve took a tiny step forward so that there chests were touching before he dipped his head down and pressed his lips to a particularly sensitive spot on Bucky\u2019s neck. Bucky sucked in a sharp breath as Steve sucked the skin into his mouth.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Steve bit down, and a spike of heat went straight to Bucky\u2019s groin. He stifled a groan, hands twitching. Before he could stop himself, he threaded his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair and pulled him in harder. Steve made a humming noise against his neck and worked the skin between his teeth for another moment before easing back, soothing the pleasant sting by licking over the spot.\n\u00a0\nWhen Steve pulled back, he looked too smug for Bucky\u2019s liking. Thanks to Bucky, Steve\u2019s hair was now sticking up badly, and the redness of his lips made him look almost debauched. \u201cWell,\u201d he mused (and yep- his tone was definitely smug), \u201cthat\u2019s a hickey.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried to remember how to use his vocal chords. \u201cThat\u2019s, uh- that\u2019s one way about it,\u201d he agreed weakly.\n\u00a0\nSteve snorted, cocking his head to scrutinize the bruise that Bucky could feel developing. \u201cDo you think one\u2019s enough to convince them?\u201d he asked, absently stroking his thumb over the hickey.\n\u00a0\nBucky tried not to shiver but probably failed. \u201cUm. I dunno.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve thought for a moment. \u201cMaybe one on your collarbone wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think they\u2019re supposed to hurt a little,\u201d Bucky shot back, trying to find his wit as his brain continued to melt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery funny. You want another one?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed heavily. \u201cUh. Sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve leaned down and started sucking another mark into Bucky\u2019s collarbone. Bucky let his eyes flutter shut as he gave into the impulse to tug at the strands of Steve\u2019s hair (in his defense, Steve didn\u2019t seem exactly opposed to the idea the last time Bucky did it). Steve was gripping his shoulder with one hand and letting the other run down his back. Bucky sighed as Steve alternated between biting and sucking until Steve finally pulled away again, and Bucky forced himself back to the present.\n\u00a0\nHe hoped his eyes didn\u2019t look too glazed.\n\u00a0\nJudging by Steve\u2019s self-satisfied smirk, Bucky probably wasn\u2019t succeeding.\n\u00a0\nSteve grabbed Bucky\u2019s hand and tugged him towards the door. \u201cUm. Your hair\u2019s all messed up,\u201d Bucky managed before they stepped outside.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at Bucky mischievously. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered and continued pulling Bucky out of the house.\n\u00a0\nHow was this guy even real?\n\u00a0\nAs Steve knocked on Sam\u2019s door, Bucky let his fingers ghost over the bruise on his collarbone, urging his mind to remove itself from the gutter.\n\u00a0\nWhich proved exceedingly difficult as Steve leaned against Bucky\u2019s side with all his warmth and muscles.\n\u00a0\nBucky bit his lip, suddenly interested in the ground.\n\u00a0\nThis was stupid.\n\u00a0\nWhy did his secret agent fake husband have to be so hot? And adorable? How could someone even be hot and adorable at the same time? Unfair.\n\u00a0\nBefore the whole incident with the memory drug and becoming a tool of the criminal underground, Bucky had been a social guy. He\u2019d been social in the sense that he\u2019d been good at flirting with strangers, good at making acquaintances, and good at interacting with a lot of people at once.\n\u00a0\nHe was antisocial in the sense that his deeper relationships were few and far between. He\u2019d loved his sister and his parents, but they were the only people he\u2019d had for a long, long time.\n\u00a0\nJames had been used to interacting with attractive people and getting them to spend the night.\n\u00a0\nBut Bucky hadn\u2019t bothered to even make small talk with anyone until Steve had shown up. Bucky\u2019s intention had been to get through the witness protection program with his head down as misery quietly ate as his heart. But Steve was completely uprooting that plan with his willingness to interact with the neighbors and his determination to become Bucky\u2019s friend. So in addition Steve\u2019s incredible physique, he was kind and dorky and maybe just as messed up as Bucky.\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t really know what his feelings were doing. He hadn\u2019t developed romantic attraction for anyone since college. He knew Steve was one of the hottest people he\u2019d ever met. But seeing him smile also made Bucky feel a little bit fuzzy on the inside.\n\u00a0\nHe had forced himself not to give the feelings much thought.\n\u00a0\nBut... maybe Bucky had a teeny-tiny crush.\n\u00a0\nJust a smidge of a crush.\n\u00a0\nReally, an insignificant speck of a crush.\n\u00a0\nA fetus of a crush.\n\u00a0\nInconsequential, really.\n\u00a0\nBucky pulled himself out of his thoughts when Tony opened the door. His eyes flicked from Steve\u2019s mussed hair to Bucky\u2019s hickeys, and he broke into a huge grin. \u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he sang delightedly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve said innocently. Bucky glanced at his too-earnest expression and thought, You little shit. His inner monologue sounded startlingly fond.\n\u00a0\nSam wandered towards them. \u201cHey, fellas. Tony\u2019s turning my coffee machine into a robot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA coffee robot,\u201d Tony added, still eying Bucky\u2019s hickeys and twirling a screwdriver absently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat seems highly unnecessary,\u201d Bucky noted, meeting Tony\u2019s gaze. Tony raised his eyebrows questioningly, and Bucky let a slow smirk spread across his features as he deliberately ran a hand down Steve\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\nSteve leaned into the touch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s super important for Sam\u2019s sanity,\u201d Tony argued. \u201cIt\u2019ll be awesome.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam sighed in resignation. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted my fate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony stepped aside with a flourish. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot like this is my house or anything,\u201d Sam grumbled sarcastically as Steve and Bucky stepped into the foyer. \u201cHow was Star Wars?\u201d he asked them with a knowing look to his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEpic,\u201d Steve informed him, reaching over to circle his fingers around Bucky\u2019s wrist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d stress to say it was even orgasmic,\u201d Bucky added, trying to sound coy.\n\u00a0\nTony laughed as Sam shook his head.\n\u00a0\nBucky tried to think about the last time he\u2019d gotten laid. It had definitely been over four months. Jesus.\n\u00a0\nThere was a beeping noise from the kitchen that sounded fairly urgent, and Tony turned and ran, yelling indistinctly about \u201ccoffee\u201d and \u201crobotics\u201d and \u201cloose wire.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam looked at them. \u201cI should probably make sure my kitchen isn\u2019t burning down.\u201d He sounded pretty defeated.\n\u00a0\nThey followed him into the kitchen to see Tony frantically digging through the coffee maker\u2019s circuitry, muttering incoherently to himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Sam asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTotally!\u201d Tony said, sounding vaguely panicked.\n\u00a0\nBucky and Steve exchanged glances.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sam said, unimpressed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Tony declared confidently just as the coffee maker burst into flames.\n\u00a0\nSteve started laughing, and Bucky said, \u201cYou can create a hyper-realistic lightsaber simulation, but you can\u2019t keep a coffee maker from combusting?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony scowled, rushing over to run the machine under water. \u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at Bucky. \u201cLightsaber simulation?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour boy-toy is an amazing sith lord,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony gets bored,\u201d Sam explained. \u201cHe gets bored and creates weird shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey hung out in the kitchen as Tony started to dismantle the blender while still participating avidly in conversation. They eventually migrated to the living room (Tony brought the blender) so they could sit down and chat.\n\u00a0\nIt was good company.\n\u00a0\nSam excused himself for a moment to start working on dinner, and a moment later, Tony distractedly got to his feet, muttering about needing a smaller screwdriver.\n\u00a0\nBucky puffed out a sigh and let his head drop onto Steve\u2019s shoulder. Steve brought a hand up to pat his cheek. \u201cYou okay, soldier?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried not to stiffen at being called soldier again. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. You?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaving fun,\u201d Steve said, sounding slightly surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t really expect this to be fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cBody guarding a reformed assassin?\u201d he asked, dropping his voice to a whisper so that only Steve could hear. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you considered fun before, but I consider that a blast,\u201d he said sarcastically.\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh? Then what did you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve pulled away to face Bucky, giving him a look. \u201cWe can talk about this later. Why don\u2019t you go check on Sam and Tony?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Bucky muttered, getting to his feet and silently approaching the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nWhen he heard hushed voices, he reflexively stopped in his tracks to listen.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...word on him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam sighed. \u201cTony, you know I haven\u2019t found him yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony let out a frustrated noise. \u201cHow can someone disappear so completely?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was an awkward pause. \u201cYou may have to accept the fact that Bruce probably isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, yeah? Just like Riley isn\u2019t coming back?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a tense pause before Sam said quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe he left you because he got sick of you always babying him,\u201d Tony went on harshly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t know the full story,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cMaybe Riley wants to come home. Maybe he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust like Bruce wants to come home?\u201d Tony practically snarled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe Bruce doesn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky came back to himself guiltily. This was obviously an extremely personal conversation. He walked into the kitchen as casually as possible, disregarding the tense atmosphere. \u201cHey, fellas,\u201d Bucky said with false cheer.\n\u00a0\nTony thrust the blender towards Bucky. \u201cI made the blender a robot that is also an alarm system.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony shrugged. \u201cI was bored.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam carefully turned towards the stove so that his back was to them. Bucky kept him in his peripheral as Sam took a few deep breaths, his shoulders knotted with tension. The ony indication that Tony was less than fine was the tight sorrow in his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSteve wandered into the room. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked casually.\n\u00a0\nBucky shot him a look, and Steve raised his eyebrows in question. Bucky tried to communicate an expression that said, Later.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI made a blender robot,\u201d Tony announced again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFabulous.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam turned around, and nobody acknowledged how strained his smile seemed. \u201cAnybody feel like staying for dinner?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI should get going,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of important shit to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam pursed his lips but said nothing.\n\u00a0\nSteve and Bucky ended up staying for dinner, Bucky watching as the tension in Sam\u2019s face finally began to relax and his smiles and laughs came more freely. It was gratifying.\n\u00a0\nBucky felt good about leaving Sam alone by the time the meal was finished, so he and Steve headed back to the house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Steve asked immediately.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned, debating whether or not it was his information to tell. \u201cI overheard Sam and Tony talking...\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him expectantly, and Bucky\u2019s shoulders slumped as he realized that he could trust Steve to keep this between them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you know how the guy who used to live in this house basically dropped off the face of the Earth?\u201d Steve nodded. \u201cWell, Tony and Sam haven\u2019t been able to find him. And- get this- Sam\u2019s husband disappeared too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA crease appeared between Steve\u2019s brows. \u201cThat\u2019s not ominous at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet a hold of yourself. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything crime-related. I\u2019d bet on normal domestic disputes,\u201d Bucky said dismissively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if they were kidnapped, though?\u201d Steve demanded seriously.\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not our place to interfere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve watched him with narrowed eyes. \u201cI\u2019m keeping an eye on this situation,\u201d he said finally.\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve tried for a smile. \u201cReturn of the Jedi?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky visibly lit up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe Soldier stared down at his bloody hands.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe mission had been straightforward. He was to terminate the target and make it look like a suicide. But the target had been stronger than initial reports suggested. There had been a struggle, and the termination had been messier than intended.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Soldier\u2019s hands started to tremble as the fog around his mind wavered.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Soldier- no. James. His name was James.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlexander Pierce gazed at him with displeasure, tapping a needle idly against his fingertips. \u201cMission failure, I take it?\u201d he said wryly.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJames wanted to scream.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe struggled wildly, thrashing his limbs out, as Pierce readied the needle and jabbed it into his forearm.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe fog in his mind returned full-force after a futile moment of resistance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d Arctic Smile asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Soldier said nothing.\n\n\u00a0\nBucky woke up with a muffled scream, biting down hard on his thumb to keep the sound somewhat contained.\n\u00a0\nHe tried to breathe, but his chest was heaving, and he was shaking all over. He had to get out of here- the walls were closing in and the air was turning to lead and-\n\u00a0\nBucky threw himself out of bed and stumbled downstairs, hugging his arms around himself to keep the pieces of his body together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve whispered, rising to his feet from his usual position by the wall. Of course he was there. \u201cBucky, what happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky choked on a sob, shaking his head rapidly. He couldn\u2019t breathe. He had to get out of this house or he was going to explode.\n\u00a0\nSteve approached him slowly, his hands held up peaceably. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked again, voice soft.\n\u00a0\nBucky flung an arm out in warning. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve faltered. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI may-\u201c he managed, \u201cI may hurt- I may kill-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Steve said, taking another step forward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI said stay away!\u201d Bucky shouted, stepping forward to shove Steve\u2019s shoulders.\n\u00a0\nSteve staggered a step backwards, posture changing from vulnerable to militant in a second flat. \u201cStand down, soldier,\u201d he snapped.\n\u00a0\nBucky stilled, his mind whirring to a halt. \u201cDo not call me that,\u201d he growled lowly.\n\u00a0\nSteve blinked, as if only just remembering himself. \u201cI-\u201c he began.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever call me that!\u201d Bucky shoved past Steve and stalked towards the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck- where are you going? What-?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOutside,\u201d Bucky replied gruffly. \u201cLeave me the fuck alone.\u201d And he slammed the door behind him.\n\u00a0\nBucky stood on the porch for a moment, taking deep, shuddering breaths. When he felt slightly more composed, he wandered across the lawn and sat down on the curb dropping his head into his hands.\n\u00a0\nHe felt ashamed.\n\u00a0\nBefore he could sink too deeply in his misery, Bucky heard the crunch of footsteps approaching and looked up.\n\u00a0\nA teenage girl stood before him, hands on her hips. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Kate Bishop, your next-door neighbor,\u201d she informed him before sitting down on the curb next to him without asking.\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced around, bewildered, before he asked in a croaking voice, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate pulled her phone out of her pocket. \u201c5:37.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky took note of her backpack. \u201cYou\u2019re going to school.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate nodded. \u201cYep. And you still haven\u2019t introduced yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scowled. \u201cBuchanan Rogers. Call me Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate nodded again. \u201cAnd your husband\u2019s name is Steve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky agreed, voice cracking pathetically.\n\u00a0\nKate sighed. \u201cSo what brings you to the curb at such a glorious hour?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky lifted a shoulder half-heartedly, looking away. \u201cSteve and I had a fight,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t exactly a lie.\n\u00a0\nKate looked at him with utmost seriousness. \u201cYou can tell me about it. I only have like five friends that I\u2019d be able to spill the details to, and none of them would care. Except maybe Clint.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky rubbed his hands up and down his thighs, trying to get them to stop fucking shaking. \u201cI just had a nightmare, and he didn\u2019t react excellently. He actually kind of set me off again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate frowned speculatively. \u201cWere you a soldier? Do you have PTSD?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrank in on himself. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t know but probably.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should go see a therapist,\u201d Kate went on nonchalantly. \u201cSam has a whole cult of therapist-followers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky snorted at the mental image. Kate beamed victoriously. \u201cI tried therapy. Wasn\u2019t really my thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should try again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed, rubbing a hand across his stubbly jaw. \u201cWhy are you talking to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate shrugged. \u201cMy dad\u2019s kind of a raging bigot. Which is insane because we live on a block with like three gay couples. He\u2019s surrounded by the gay. But anyway, I told him that I may be into girls too, and he\u2019s been kind of a bitch about it. He wakes up at six, so I\u2019ve been leaving the house before then. I don\u2019t actually have to be at school until seven-thirty, but it\u2019s better than my dad right now. I\u2019m a little early today and you looked like shit, so I figured I\u2019d socialize.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cWell, fuck your dad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate smirked. \u201cHe\u2019s a fat asshole.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky giggled a little bit, still jittery with adrenaline and high on nerves. Kate looked at him oddly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, question,\u201d she said, leaning back slightly. \u201cHow do you ask a girl to prom?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cI think I made a poster.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe would hate that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cWhy does everything have to be so complicated? Why can\u2019t you just ask her?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate scrunched up her face. \u201cI dunno. Social constructs have embedded themselves into my brain?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeep it simple. It\u2019s hard to find simple sometimes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKate nudged him. \u201cThanks, Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wrinkled his nose. \u201cOkay, I change my mind. You\u2019re too young. Call me Mr. Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope!\u201d Kate declared cheerfully, bouncing to her feet. She tapped him with her toe and inclined her head in the direction of Bucky\u2019s house with a meaningful look. Bucky turned.\n\u00a0\nSteve was frozen on the bottom step of the porch, a mug clutched tightly in his hand, expression akin to a deer in the headlights.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Kate said, and skipped towards her car.\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed, running his hand through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. C\u2019mere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve hesitated before cautiously approaching Bucky. He stopped a few feet away. \u201cI- uh- I brought you coffee,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u00a0\nBucky made grabby hands, and Steve gave a huff, gingerly lowering himself to sit next to Bucky and handing him the mug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Steve whispered. \u201cI should\u2019ve just left you alone. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky dropped his head onto Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shifted to wrap his arm around Bucky\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI was just scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the future, just pacify me. I can be pretty irrational when I get like that,\u201d Bucky whispered, rubbing his face against Steve\u2019s neck contentedly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you brought me coffee. You\u2019re kind of adorable.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky felt Steve\u2019s skin heat and tried not to smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKate Bishop, our next-door neighbor, talked me down,\u201d Bucky explained. \u201cShe thinks I need a therapist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could always ask Sam for a recommendation,\u201d Steve said seriously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, whenever you are, I\u2019ll stand by you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis was what drove Bucky crazy. How Steve sometimes acted like they were married and in love without anybody else around. It made him feel too happy- too warm.\n\u00a0\nAnd that was dangerous.\n\u00a0\nBucky let out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s what he called me,\u201d he whispered, squeezing his eyes shut, and Steve went still. \u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t remember my name, he called me the Soldier.\u201d His voice wavered, and he had to stop talking.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s arm tightened around his shoulders. \u201cBastard,\u201d he muttered darkly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky managed, voice choked. They were quiet for a long time before Bucky murmured, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even remember everybody I killed. I don\u2019t remember. That\u2019s even worse than the fact that I killed them. That\u2019s so fucked up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve pulled Bucky tighter against his body. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he said fiercely.\n\u00a0\nBucky just shook his head slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Steve added, almost as an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him for what he did to you- for what he did to everyone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought, Stevie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey stayed like that for a long time, pressed together on the curb with Bucky tucked into Steve, clutching the mug of coffee like a lifeline.\n\u00a0\nAnd the oddest thing was that Bucky had never felt safer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLater, Bucky got a text from an unknown number that just contained a picture of him and Steve essentially cuddling on the curb.\n\u00a0\nBUCKY: Who is this\n\u00a0\nUNKNOWN NUMBER: its natasha lol\n\u00a0\nBUCKY: How did you get this picture?????????\n\u00a0\nNATASHA: kate took it and texted it to clint and he texted it to me :P\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed, looking to the heavens. Steve glanced at him, a worried pull to his eyebrows. \u201cKate took a picture of us on the curb this morning, and it\u2019s making its rounds among the neighbors.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky thrust the phone in his face as he approached from where he\u2019d been cleaning the kitchen again. \u201cText it to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky did, and then launched into a rant about invasive neighbors minding their own business. Steve watched him with an affectionate smile until he was finished. \u201cYou like them,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do not,\u201d Bucky lied.\n\u00a0\n(Later, when Bucky peaked over to see what Steve was doing on his phone, he saw that the picture was now his background.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe landline was ringing.\n\u00a0\nThe landline never rang.\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t even know they had a landline.\n\u00a0\nBucky was staring at it in abject horror, frozen in the middle of his trek to get a snack. Steve poked his head over the upstairs landing, paint smeared across his forehead adorably. \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a landline?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve cursed and vaulted himself down the stairs, skidding to a stop in front of the phone with impressive speed. He picked up and said in a clipped tone, \u201cRogers\u2019 residence.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause. The lines on Steve\u2019s face deepened, and Bucky felt his skin start to prickle. He reflexively looked for the clock, needing the security of numbers.\n\u00a0\nIt had been sixty-four days, eight hours, and forty-four minutes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cConfirm. This is Agent One.\u201d Steve rubbed a hand across his jaw. \u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cIs my assistance required?\u201d Another pause. \u201cAnd what of the current mission?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt always hit Bucky like a slap in the face when he remembered that Steve was literally being paid to live here. He looked away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEstimated duration?\u201d A pause. \u201cWhen do you need me?\u201d A pause. \u201cConfirm.\u201d Steve hung up, looking at Bucky. Bucky was suddenly reminded of how tired Steve always looked. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta leave you for a few days. I dunno how long it\u2019s gonna be, but at least five days.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky froze. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis takes priority,\u201d Steve said, not meeting his eyes. \u201cThey need my focus elsewhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed heavily. He hated when Steve was like this. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pack.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stood, body rigid, in the no man\u2019s land between the living room and the kitchen. He clenched and unclenched his fist. The abrupt shift of Steve\u2019s personality was giving him fucking vertigo.\n\u00a0\nHe found himself bracing his weight on the counter, eyes closed, adrenaline crashing. This week was gonna suck shit. Bucky could feel it.\n\u00a0\nSteve made his way downstairs after a while, a bag slung over his shoulder. He shifted awkwardly. \u201cI may call you while I\u2019m out if we\u2019re given any down-time. I want to check in- make sure you haven\u2019t burned the house down.\u201d He was trying for a joking tone, but it fell short.\n\u00a0\nBucky blew out a breath, looking Steve over for a long moment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like you in mission mode,\u201d he confessed quietly.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t like me like that either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt makes you look older,\u201d Bucky added.\n\u00a0\nSteve absently touched his own cheek. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay safe, right?\u201d Bucky whispered. \u201cCome back in one piece?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled humorlessly, his eyes bitter. \u201cI\u2019m kind of indestructible, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. \u201cYou leaving right now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the car.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey made their way outside, and Steve threw his bag into the passenger\u2019s seat. Bucky was about to open his mouth for a potentially pathetic good-bye when he heard someone make a noise. He looked over to see an older, pot-bellied man standing by some shrubs. He was staring at them with disdain, trying to be covert about it. This must have been Kate\u2019s bigoted father.\n\u00a0\nSteve followed his gaze, and when he looked back at Bucky, there was a familiar glint in his eye. Bucky looked at him warily, because that glint meant mischief.\n\u00a0\nSteve sauntered over to him, deliberately drawing attention to his narrow hips. He slid his hands down Bucky\u2019s sides until he tucked them in Bucky\u2019s back pockets. Steve pulled them flush together and murmured, \u201cWe should give him something other than his daughter to bitch about.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Bucky managed, knowing where Steve was going with this. Steve let a slow smirk spread across his features, and Bucky couldn\u2019t help but stare- he was only human. His hands had somehow found themselves resting against the strong muscles of Steve\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\nSteve leaned in, pressing their lips together in a kiss that immediately turned hot and open-mouthed. Bucky let out an admittedly indecent moan, curling his tongue around Steve\u2019s. Steve\u2019s hands tightened their possessive grip on his ass, pulling Bucky impossibly closer.\n\u00a0\nSteve bit down on Bucky\u2019s lip before soothing the spot with his tongue. Bucky broke away for an instant to nip at Steve\u2019s jawline, reaching the sensitive place below his ear. Steve let out a small noise that Bucky definitely wanted to further investigate, but Steve got impatient and dragged him back up.\n\u00a0\nKate\u2019s father was making a choking noise, but Bucky didn\u2019t even register it until he let out a deliberately loud cough. Steve broke away, leaving Bucky thoroughly disoriented, desire thrumming through his veins, as Steve stepped back and turned to Mr. Bishop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sorry, sir. Were we bothering you?\u201d he asked with icy politeness.\n\u00a0\nMr. Bishop sputtered inelegantly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Steve went on snarkily, \u201cthat you wouldn\u2019t want our lives to intrude on yours. I mean, if your wife was leaving for an indefinite amount of time, we would never expect you to kiss her good-bye. Talk about public decency.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoung man-\u201c Mr. Bishop snapped, eyes narrowed, expression haughty.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s brain finally decided to reboot. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he nearly shouted. \u201cWas our public display of affection making you uncomfortable?\u201d Mr. Bishop looked aghast. \u201cWell, you can suck my dick! Except- oh, wait- Steve already did that this morning!\u201d Bucky reached out his hand, and Steve met him for a high five without prompting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the shower,\u201d Steve added, smirking.\n\u00a0\n(Bucky\u2019s brain went a little wonky at the image. What was the point here? He\u2019d had a point in the dick-sucking comment.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is-\u201c Mr. Bishop tried, but he was too angry/flustered. Bucky watched gleefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith all due respect, sir. Fuck you. I\u2019m trying to say good-bye to my husband, and we\u2019d appreciate a moment of privacy,\u201d Bucky cut in.\n\u00a0\nMr. Bishop, still gaping like a fish, turned on heel and stormed into his house.\n\u00a0\nSteve turned to Bucky, trying not to smile. \u201cI was trying to make my point subtlety.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoing in like a runaway train is more fun,\u201d Bucky shot back, not mentioning that he definitely would\u2019ve had more tact if Steve hadn\u2019t just had his tongue in Bucky\u2019s mouth.\n\u00a0\nSteve giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s my usual approach,\u201d he admitted. Then, he reached out for Bucky.\n\u00a0\nBucky stepped into the comforting circle of Steve\u2019s arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019M gonna miss you,\u201d Steve whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll miss you too, you fucking punk,\u201d Bucky grumbled.\n\u00a0\nSteve watched him carefully. \u201cAfter I go, could you check and see if I turned the lights off in my room?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled, albeit a little bit sadly. \u201cI\u2019ll try and call you when I know when I can come home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe called it home, Bucky thought dumbly. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you start to feel unsafe, call Natasha,\u201d Steve said, dropping his voice low. \u201cI trust her capabilities.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I will. You be careful out there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve held the side of Bucky\u2019s face for a moment, locking their eyes for what felt like forever. \u201cYou too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then he turned and climbed into the car.\n\u00a0\nBucky watched him drive away, trying not to feel hollow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he went to make sure the lights were off in Steve\u2019s room (they were), Bucky paused in the doorway, noticing the open sketchbook lying on the bed. Steve never left his sketchbook open, even if he was comfortable showing Bucky his drawings.\n\u00a0\nBucky approached the book cautiously and found a cartoonish drawing of Steve holding out a heart. SORRY I WAS SUCH A DICK, was written carefully in the blank space.\n\u00a0\nBucky sat heavily on Steve\u2019s bed, pressing his hand into his mouth as an onslaught of emotion hit him like a tidal wave.\n\u00a0\nHe clutched Steve\u2019s sketchbook to his chest and cried for exactly seven minutes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky hated everything.\n\u00a0\nThe house was too empty.\n\u00a0\nThe absence of Steve felt downright awful. It was too quiet, reminding Bucky of the first eight days he\u2019d spent at the house, alone and miserable.\n\u00a0\nBucky stood at the fridge, contemplating the bottle of beer. He knew if he started drinking, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop any time soon. Bucky had never really been an alcoholic, but he knew his emotional state was tenuous at best.\n\u00a0\nInstead of grabbing the bottle, Bucky grabbed the newest stack of envelopes addressed to Bruce Banner and headed over to Tony\u2019s house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi,\u201d Bucky grumbled miserably when Tony opened the door.\n\u00a0\nTony raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ran a hand through his hair. \u201cSteve left on a business trip, and he doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s gonna be gone.\u201d He thrust out the envelopes. \u201cMore mail.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony took them, but he kept his eyes on Bucky. \u201cWant to watch while I make a robot suit?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky followed Tony into the house and downstairs to the basement. This was Tony\u2019s lab/workshop area. Tony sat down on a swivel chair and immediately went to work on what was apparently a robot suit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna fly,\u201d Tony explained, examining a blowtorch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey sat in silence for a while, Tony occasionally muttering to himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, is your dad Howard Stark?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony looked up sharply but tried to look dismissive. \u201cWell, he technically disowned me, but yeah, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re out here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony offered a wry smile. \u201cI wanted Stark Industries to shift from the weapons industry to clean energy. Pops wasn\u2019t too keen on the idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re here,\u201d Bucky said slowly, frowning. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony looked confused. \u201cWhat do you mean? I can\u2019t work at Stark Industries because my father would never allow it. What else am I gonna do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet off your ass and make a difference. Be better.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony narrowed his eyes. \u201cLook, Rogers. I know you\u2019re having a shitty day, but that doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to tell me how to live my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky held up his hands defensively. \u201cIt was just a suggestion. You don\u2019t have to take it any other way.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony returned to his project, a line of displeasure between his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting on my ass here,\u201d Tony said abruptly. \u201cI\u2019m doing good things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, could I be doing better things? Probably. But it\u2019s not like I can just go door-to-door and ask people if they want clean energy homes.\u201d Tony waved a screwdriver around. \u201cThat would be insane.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough,\u201d Tony added thoughtfully, \u201cI could advertise. People generally know who I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got people who\u2019d be willing to help me out as long as there\u2019s profit involved. Shit, how do I make a profit? I\u2019m not a business man- I\u2019m a scientist.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony looked at him. \u201cWhat do you even do for the government?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI go over cases to see if there are any discrepancies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of boring reading.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded. \u201cYeah, that doesn\u2019t help me at all.\u201d He looked at Bucky intently. \u201cSee, the only reason I ever had faith in Stark Industries was because they had money. And like, a lot of people use money to get more money, but I wanted to use the money to do something good for once in my life. Howard took that away from me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook, Stark,\u201d Bucky began, leaning forward in his seat. \u201cI grew up pretty fucking poor. The only reason my sister and I could go to college was because we got a shitton of scholarships. Money has always been an issue for us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that you have the ability to get money. Howard didn\u2019t take your dream away from you. He just made it more difficult to achieve. If Becca and I could get through college with barely any cash, you can do your fucking clean energy thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony sighed, running a greasy hand through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smirked. \u201cJust saying.\u201d There was a stretch of silence. \u201cTell me about the clean energy thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI call it the arc reactor,\u201d he announced before launching into a lengthy, technical description that Bucky could barely understand.\n\u00a0\nBut he was trying to listen, and the arc reactor sounded massive. \u201cAny way to make it on a small scale?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\nTony waved a hand. \u201cDuh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWork on that, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d Tony muttered but moved to another table and started laying out materials.\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled to himself and watched Tony work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d a crisp voice with a British accent called.\n\u00a0\nBucky turned to see one of the old ladies that lived across the street. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman gave him a once-over. \u201cSteve was supposed to meet us for tea this morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked. He had no idea that Steve had been friendly with the old ladies. \u201cHe had to leave kind of suddenly. Business trip.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman frowned. \u201cCome inside. Buchanan, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Bucky said, feeling unbelievably small under the woman\u2019s gaze.\n\u00a0\nBucky approached her, and she extended her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Margaret Carter, but please call me Peggy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shook her hand. \u201cThen, you can call me Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe nodded. \u201cI have tea, and I won\u2019t have it go to waste.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looked at her in resignation. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAngie isn\u2019t such a fan of tea,\u201d Peggy explained as Bucky followed her inside. \u201cSteve likes tea.\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cYou have a fine young man to call your husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Peggy said, smirking a little bit in a way that resembled Steve\u2019s smirk a little too much for his liking.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeggy lifted a shoulder as she made her way around the kitchen, and Bucky sat down at the table. \u201cAn old woman is allowed to look. Steve is-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuper hot, yeah. I know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeggy laughed. \u201cI\u2019m glad we have an understanding.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEnglish, are you flirting with the Rogers boy again?\u201d a voice called from the other room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different Rogers today, darling!\u201d Peggy called.\n\u00a0\nThere was a shuffling noise before the other old lady (who Bucky assumed was Angie) came into the room, eyeing Bucky critically. \u201cHe\u2019s here to drink your communist tea?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs if coffee is any better?\u201d Peggy demanded, affronted.\n\u00a0\nAngie rolled her eyes, looking at Bucky. \u201cBrits.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDarling, I thought you liked my accent.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAngie grinned, holding apart her thumb and forefinger. \u201cA smidge.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeggy glanced at Bucky as she passed him the tea. \u201cSee what I have to deal with.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou only have yourself to blame- you\u2019re the one who proposed, remember?\u201d Angie snarked back.\n\u00a0\nPeggy pursed her lips theatrically. \u201cI did?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAngie laughed, sitting down in the chair next to Peggy and dropping her head on Peggy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAngie nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend to like the tea, Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky laughed, while Peggy looked mock-offended.\n\u00a0\nAngie grumbled to herself good-naturedly as she poured herself some coffee. Peggy and Bucky sipped at their tea in silence because Bucky knew that it was definitely too late to tell them he actually preferred coffee.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, how\u2019d you guys get so buddy-buddy with Steve?\u201d Bucky asked curiously. Over the course of the twenty-seven days since Steve had arrived, they\u2019d pretty much spent ninety-five percent of their days together and consequently told each other everything about the other five percent. Or so Bucky had thought.\n\u00a0\nPeggy looked at him. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t much to tell. He just comes over for a cup of tea every few days. Usually right before he goes running.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat explained why Bucky had no idea when these meetings were happening. He was usually still asleep or pretending to be asleep before Steve went running.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe talks about you a lot,\u201d Angie added with a grin.\n\u00a0\nBucky ducked his head shyly. \u201cAw, really?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s your husband, my dear. Don\u2019t sound so shocked,\u201d Peggy chided.\n\u00a0\nBucky twisted the wedding band around his finger. \u201cYeah,\u201d he sighed.\n\u00a0\nAngie and Peggy exchanged a glance in which they seemed to have an entire conversation. \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned. \u201cI mean, he had to leave pretty abruptly, right?\u201d They nodded understandingly. \u201cSo we yelled at each other a little bit, but I think we still left things on good terms. I mean- I just miss him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAww,\u201d Angie crooned.\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed, staring intently at his tea. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend,\u201d he mumbled, hunching his shoulders self-consciously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Peggy said softly.\n\u00a0\nBucky took a sip from his tea, knowing Peggy and Angie were still watching him expectantly.\n\u00a0\nHe licked his lips. \u201cWe should tell each other everything,\u201d he said slowly, trying to take care with keeping his words vague at best. \u201cBut we don\u2019t. There are certain subjects we\u2019ve barely touched upon. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healthy, and I guess it\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d Angie and Peggy said at the same time.\n\u00a0\nBucky cringed at himself. \u201cI- uh- we\u2019ve both been through some shit. I don\u2019t think either of us have ever talked to anybody about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeggy served in World War II,\u201d Angie told him. \u201cShe had PTSD- still does, I think. It took her a long time to tell me anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Peggy affirmed. \u201cTrauma isn\u2019t a light subject, Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to give yourself time to acknowledge whatever shit you\u2019ve been through before you can talk about it with some objectivity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky took another sip of tea. \u201cEveryone thinks I should go see a therapist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTherapy isn\u2019t a bad thing, you know?\u201d Peggy said sternly, a furrow in her brows.\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. \u201cI guess. I just really don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got time,\u201d Angie said. \u201cYou\u2019re young.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeez, I didn\u2019t mean to get so gloomy on you guys. I don\u2019t normally unload like this,\u201d Bucky said, terribly embarrassed. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeggy waved a dismissive hand. \u201cI live for this shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky choked on his tea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs a couple that\u2019s been together since the fifties,\u201d Angie added, \u201cI think you should probably talk to Steve about all this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m always right,\u201d Angie agreed as Peggy rolled her eyes fondly. Angie leaned forward on her elbows. \u201cSo, talk to me. What\u2019s new with you kids and your memes and shit?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky burst into laughter, and Angie looked pleased with herself. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the current meme culture,\u201d he admitted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrandpa,\u201d Angie coughed into her hand. Peggy whacked her on the back of the head.\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled with brightness- it was possibly the most genuine smile he\u2019d had since Steve had left.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was definitely not moping.\n\u00a0\nOn an unrelated note, everything sucked shit and the world hated him and Steve was still gone.\n\u00a0\nIt had been five days, and he hadn\u2019t even contacted him. Bucky checked his phone every two minutes, and he was starting to get jittery with anxiety. What if Steve was hurt? What if he didn\u2019t come back?\n\u00a0\nHe glared at the stupid house show as if it was responsible.\n\u00a0\n(Although, the house they were currently showcasing had a really nice color scheme. Steve would probably appreciate its- goddammit, Barnes, not everything is about motherfucking Steve Rogers.)\n\u00a0\n(\u201cA smidge,\u201d Bucky\u2019s inner monologue argued with a pout.)\n\u00a0\n(Bucky sighed, conceding that his inner monologue probably had a point.)\n\u00a0\nBucky was clicking the home button of his phone again when the phone buzzed. He yelped aloud, scrambling to read the text.\n\u00a0\nNATASHA: i know ur sulking come over 4 coffee\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed. Still no Steve. He scrubbed a hand over his face. It wasn\u2019t even 6:00 yet.\n\u00a0\nBUCKY: Right now?\n\u00a0\nNATASHA: yas\n\u00a0\nBUCKY: You serious?\n\u00a0\nNATASHA: Clint and I do not joke about coffee.\n\u00a0\nThe proper punctuation of the text threw Bucky off enough to get him out the door and over to Clint and Natasha\u2019s porch. Natasha opened the door before he even knocked, dressed in compression shorts and a sports bra, hair tied back in a messy and short ponytail. \u201cRogers,\u201d she said curtly, stepping aside to let him in.\n\u00a0\nBucky shuffled inside. \u201cWhy did you invite me over?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha frowned. \u201cYou seem lonely.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged.\n\u00a0\nFrom the kitchen, they heard a crash, followed by a whiny, \u201cAww, coffee, no.\u201d Another crash resounded, followed by an even whinier, \u201cAww, Liho, nooo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt Bucky\u2019s questioning look, Natasha sighed and said, \u201cClint and the cat probably broke something.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSure enough, as soon as they walked into the kitchen, Clint shouted, \u201cIt was the cat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha stared at him blankly.\n\u00a0\nClint crumpled. \u201cOkay. Maybe it was a little bit me.\u201d He was in the process of trying to shove shards off coffee mug into the trash.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIdiots,\u201d Natasha said, addressing both Clint and a too-innocent looking Liho affectionately.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha scoffed and poured two mugs of coffee, passing one to Bucky. Clint shrugged and started drinking straight from the pot. Bucky started drinking his own coffee gratefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow you holding up, Bucko?\u201d Clint asked, unsuccessfully trying to wrangle a tie. Natasha rolled her eyes and did the knot for him while Clint looked at her like she created the universe itself.\n\u00a0\nBucky scowled deeply in answer to Clint\u2019s question.\n\u00a0\nClint laughed, and Natasha turned to look at him. \u201cWow. You\u2019re angsty without Steve. I like it,\u201d she declared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm. Thanks?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha raised her mug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid Steve tell you how awesome he was with the kindergarteners last week?\u201d Clint asked, continuing to drink straight from the pot.\n\u00a0\nSteve had agreed to talk to Clint\u2019s kindergarteners about being a professional illustrator and had come home absolutely beaming about it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bet he undersold himself. A few kids told me they wanted to be artists after he left,\u201d Clint told Bucky, grinning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know. People are too dismissive when it comes to artists. God knows I could never do what they do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cYou ever seen Steve get into the zone?\u201d Clint and Natasha shook their heads in sync. \u201cHe has this whole extra sense. It\u2019s amazing. And really ridiculously hot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha snorted. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s thoughts drifted slightly. \u201cMmmmmm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSnap out of it, Rogers,\u201d Natasha said, literally snapping her fingers in front of his face. \u201cYou get sex when he comes back. For now, join us in the real world.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ignored the way he was flushing. \u201cWhatever. Like you\u2019ve never drifted while Clint was away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha lifted a noncommittal shoulder. Clint looked offended, and Natasha reached over to pinch his bicep, her expression flickering into a smile as Clint yelped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway. It\u2019s terrible because we don\u2019t know when he\u2019s coming back,\u201d Bucky said, trying not to pout.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s always sexting,\u201d Clint suggested mildly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, he\u2019s super busy,\u201d Bucky grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet over yourself,\u201d Natasha muttered playfully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow. Fuck you,\u201d Bucky shot back melodramatically.\n\u00a0\nClint giggled and lit up as Lucky sleepily padded into the kitchen. \u201cHey, pizza dog.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLucky perked up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo pizza right now,\u201d Clint informed him apologetically, crouching down to give him some proper attention. Lucky essentially preened.\n\u00a0\nNatasha leaned close to Bucky and stage whispered, \u201cHe gives that dog more love than me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear what you just said, but I\u2019m sure it defaced my character in some respect. I advise Bucky not to listen to your lies,\u201d Clint said cheerfully, his voice a little bit too loud for normal conversation.\n\u00a0\nBucky snorted, and Natasha made a face. Clint looked up, and she signed something at him.\n\u00a0\nClint looked affronted. \u201cWhat about last night?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha signed something again, and Clint\u2019s face turned so red that he had to look away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask,\u201d Bucky muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood choice,\u201d Clint said faintly.\n\u00a0\nNatasha lifted a nonchalant shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cToday, the principal is doing her in-class evaluation thing,\u201d Clint explained to Bucky, \u201cso I put on a fucking tie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt physically pains him to wear it,\u201d Natasha added.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have nothing to worry about, though. My kindergarteners are smart and well-rounded,\u201d he bragged.\n\u00a0\nNatasha patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got the tiny munchkin ballerinas today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNat secretly adores small children,\u201d Clint said to Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Natasha said, leaning over to stroke Liho\u2019s fur.\n\u00a0\nClint grinned at Bucky, opening his mouth to say something else, but his grip on the coffee pot slipped, and it crashed to the floor in a mess of glass and coffee.\n\u00a0\nClint pouted. \u201cAw, coffee, no.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt had been ten days, five hours, and three minutes since Steve had left.\n\u00a0\nBucky was watching Pacific Rim in Sam\u2019s living room, trying to give the movie his undivided attention like the movie deserved.\n\u00a0\nHe checked his phone again.\n\u00a0\nNothing.\n\u00a0\nHe sighed, and Sam glanced over knowingly. \u201cMissing your boy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky immediately felt guilty. He knew Sam\u2019s husband had been gone for over a month, and here he was moping about the guy he\u2019d only known for thirty-six days. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u00a0\nSam gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to miss him. Lord knows I miss my husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky froze, not expecting Sam to bring it up.\n\u00a0\nSam smiled humorlessly. \u201cYeah, I know you\u2019ve noticed by now that he hasn\u2019t been around. It\u2019s okay- I mean, not okay, but I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bucky said quietly, sincerely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGot nothing to do with you.\u201d Sam turned his attention back to the movie. \u201cI think Riley and I would\u2019ve been damn good jaeger partners.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. We were pararescue together. Always sort of been able to read each other.\u201d Sam smiled sadly. \u201cOr at least, I thought so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam gave him a look. They fell silent.\n\u00a0\nBucky was reaching for his phone again some time later when it started buzzing. He leapt to his feet, and Sam startled. \u201cSorry,\u201d Bucky whispered, and answered the call from BLOCKED NUMBER. \u201cHello?\u201d he said apprehensively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve breathed.\n\u00a0\nBucky felt himself slump in relief. \u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. I should be there in, like, three hours,\u201d Steve said, voice slightly crackly over the line.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll in one piece?\u201d Bucky asked, trying to keep his tone light.\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed dryly. \u201cYeah, Buck, I\u2019m fine. I heal pretty quick.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank god,\u201d Bucky muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou doing okay? Anything happen while I was gone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bucky began, \u201cThe neighbors proved invasive as ever.\u201d He shot a mock-dirty look at Sam, who smirked and held up his hands defensively. \u201cAnd I had tea with Angie and Peggy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Steve asked in surprise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. They\u2019re sweet old ladies.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Steve said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that Peggy has killed a man with a fork.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Bucky agreed mildly, happiness buzzing through his body. \u201cI\u2019m over at Sam\u2019s now. We\u2019re watching Pacific Rim.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I love that movie. What do you think our jaeger would be called?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s heart pounded. Steve acted like it was implicit that they would be jaeger partners. He gave a watery smile. \u201cI dunno. You\u2019re the creative one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pause. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta ditch this burner phone now. I\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you,\u201d Bucky said softly (married people closed phone calls with love you\u2019s, right?).\n\u00a0\nSteve snorted. \u201cBye, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBye.\u201d The line went dead.\n\u00a0\nBucky turned to Sam, who had both his eyebrows raised. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be home in a few hours. Sorry about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. Warms my heart to see two people in love.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed. He hated lying to Sam.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on. Watch movies with me until he gets back,\u201d Sam prompted, throwing in a cheeky grin that showed off his teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Bucky said, flopping back down on the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, man. Just for that, Princess Bride is next.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was my plan all along,\u201d Bucky informed him theatrically.\n\u00a0\nThey watched movies throughout the afternoon, making snarky comments and just generally having a great time, until Bucky heard the rumbling of an engine just as Home Alone was ending. He peeked out the window, as he had been doing any time he\u2019d heard a car for the past two hours, and broke into a huge grin when he saw it was Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d Sam declared, shoving to his feet as Bucky bolted for the front door.\n\u00a0\nSteve was getting out of the car, and everything about his demeanor suggested exhaustion. A miscellaneous wave of emotion hit Bucky, and he ran the rest of the distance, Steve turning when he heard the movement.\n\u00a0\nWhen Steve saw him, a big but tired smile broke out on his face, and he opened his arms. Bucky fell into them, sinking into the warmth of Steve\u2019s body.\n\u00a0\nSteve tilted his chin upwards and pressed their lips together, kissing him gently and slowly. It was definitely up there in the top five best kisses that Bucky had ever had, leaving him weak in the knees and aching for more as Steve pulled away. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured in Bucky\u2019s ear. \u201cSam was watching.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried not to visibly freeze. Right. This was all fake. Why did it always hurt so much to remember that?\n\u00a0\nBucky ignored his own feelings and jabbed Steve hard in the chest. \u201cI missed you, you punk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I missed you too, you jerk,\u201d Steve returned affectionately, tapping their foreheads together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we go inside?\u201d Bucky asked with a sigh, still plastered to Steve\u2019s chest and not really planning on moving any time soon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold on a second,\u201d Steve said, sounding vaguely bemused. \u201cI brought you something.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky perked up, lifting his head from where it had been resting against Steve\u2019s collarbone. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed, stepping away and turning to the passenger\u2019s seat. Bucky mourned the loss of contact for a moment before Steve returned with a brown paper bag sporting a familiar logo. \u201cYou got me bagels?\u201d Bucky managed, actually tearing up a little bit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaria\u2019s bagels,\u201d Steve confirmed, handing Bucky the bag. \u201cI was in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are the best thing to ever happen to me,\u201d Bucky whispered, looking at the contents of the bag and completely missing Steve\u2019s blush.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Steve,\u201d Sam said from somewhere behind him. \u201cGlad you\u2019re back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Sam. Thanks for looking out for him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, he was pretty hopeless without you,\u201d Sam teased.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas not!\u201d Bucky snapped. \u201cI was very responsible.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd bitchy,\u201d Sam added with a cough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve leaned into Bucky\u2019s side. \u201cYou okay if I steal him?\u201d he asked Sam jokingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam said, sighing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to be around for your reuniting sex.\u201d He added a shudder, and Steve laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you got me bagels,\u201d Bucky muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnything for my best guy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ducked his head, smiling widely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to it,\u201d Sam said pointedly, backing away towards his house and turning away with a meaningful wink.\n\u00a0\nSteve and Bucky walked into the kitchen, Bucky immediately preparing a bagel. \u201cHow was the mission?\u201d he asked, more serious.\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed, leaning heavily against the counter as he watched Bucky. \u201cLong. Dangerous.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve ran a hand through his hair, causing the strands to stick up atrociously. Bucky\u2019s fingers twitched, wanting to smooth it back into place. \u201cYeah. More people died because of me, but that\u2019s nothing new,\u201d he said, trying to keep his tone light.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned around his bite of bagel (delicious as always, thank-you-very-much). \u201cOh?\u201d he said carefully.\n\u00a0\nSteve tensed. \u201cSorry, ignore me. I probably need to shut up for a while- I\u2019m still healing, and that sometimes makes me feel weird. And act weird.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Bucky asked, worry shooting through him.\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just a few gunshot wounds. Should be better in the morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve!\u201d Bucky shouted, dropping his bagel in surprise. Steve jumped, staring at the bagel. \u201cYou were shot?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe looked vaguely confused. \u201cUm. Yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Bucky despaired, picking his bagel up again and shoving a bite that was too big into his mouth.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked around the room, seeming to shrink in on himself. \u201cI\u2019m gonna start straightening up. You didn\u2019t clean at all while I was gone, did you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stared at Steve, not fooled. \u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll start on the upstairs, and work my way down,\u201d Steve announced, pushing himself off the counter. \u201cEat your bagel, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay out of your room,\u201d he went on, heading for the stairs. \u201cI know that\u2019s your space.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t meet Bucky\u2019s eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve ignored him, heading upstairs and gathering various items of equipment to start cleaning.\n\u00a0\nBucky cursed and scarfed down the rest of his bagel. Sure, Steve cleaned when he was stressed, but Bucky could tell that this was something on a much greater scale. Steve was pale and jittery, healing from fucking gunshot wounds, and men had died under his watch on the mission. This could not be good.\n\u00a0\nBut he knew Steve wouldn\u2019t listen to him right now, much in the same way that Bucky wouldn\u2019t be able to listen if somebody told him to stop counting the moments. This, he understood.\n\u00a0\nSo, instead of demanding Steve stop, he followed him from room to room as Steve furiously scrubbed at imaginary stains and reorganized bookshelves. Bucky pretended to read a book as he followed Steve around. Steve was either ignoring him or was too far away to even register his presence.\n\u00a0\nAnd that was fine with Bucky as he followed Steve downstairs, through the rooms that honestly didn\u2019t need to be cleaned.\n\u00a0\nBucky could handle it until they reached the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nSteve scrubbed so hard at the place behind the coffee maker that the marble warped slightly. Bucky walked over to inspect the situation and saw that Steve had an angry gash across his knuckles. He must\u2019ve scraped it against something.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve, you\u2019re bleeding,\u201d Bucky whispered softly.\n\u00a0\nSteve swallowed visibly, not looking up. \u201cIt\u2019ll heal in a minute. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStevie, it\u2019s clean.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head, and Bucky noted with alarm that silent tears had started to streak down his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky whispered again, and reached out.\n\u00a0\nSteve flinched when Bucky laid his hand on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Steve gasped, tears coming harder now. Bucky wrapped his arms tightly around Steve\u2019s torso, pressing his arms into his sides to half-restrain him. Steve dropped his cleaning products and crumpled against him.\n\u00a0\nBucky led them carefully upstairs, Steve still shaking and crying silently. But when Bucky pushed open the door to his own room, Steve froze and refused to move. \u201cSteve, come on. I know you only ever sleep when you pass out, and I know you absolutely need to sleep right now. You know I don\u2019t get much sleep either, and this may just work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve sagged forward and nodded, letting himself be pulled into Bucky\u2019s room. He was startlingly pliant as Bucky carefully pushed him into the bed. Steve struggled to remove his jeans, mumbling a weak, \u201cSorry,\u201d as the fabric stubbornly clung to his thighs. Bucky just shook his head, grabbing the ankles of the jeans and tugging them off.\n\u00a0\nSteve flopped back, and Bucky glanced down at his own sweatpants, deeming himself fit to go to sleep. He crawled under the covers, and Steve immediately curled into him with a shuddering breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere was an explosion,\u201d he whispered hoarsely. Bucky made a hushing noise and ran his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cI should\u2019ve noticed something was wrong. A lot of people were injured. A lot of people died.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed, and it was a bitter, horrible sound. \u201cI was in charge.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve Rogers, you listen to me,\u201d Bucky whispered fiercely, pulling Steve tighter against him. \u201cThere was no way you could\u2019ve done anything, even if you noticed something was up. You are not responsible for these lives- whoever planted the explosion is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Buck,\u201d he murmured brokenly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNone of it is your fault,\u201d Bucky said again, pressing a kiss to the top of Steve\u2019s head absentmindedly. \u201cNot your fault. Not your fault.\u201d Bucky repeated the words until Steve released enough tension to completely collapse on him. His weight increased as sleep gradually took him. Bucky smoothed a finger across one of the dark circles under Steve\u2019s eyes before he settled in more comfortably to try and get some sleep himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky woke with a start as Steve climbed out of bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh- sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d Steve whispered, standing in only his boxers and a T-shirt. Bucky licked his dry lips and kept his eyes above the waist. \u201cJust wanted to go on my run.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Go ahead. I\u2019ll meet you in the kitchen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve scratched the back of his head, shuffling awkwardly. \u201cThanks for last night. I actually managed to sleep for eight hours,\u201d he said, sounding surprised.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked slowly. \u201cEight hours? Fuck, new record.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him sheepishly. \u201cSo, I guess this worked,\u201d he concluded, gesturing towards the bed and trying not to blush.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can keep doing this, then,\u201d Bucky said, trying to keep his voice casual. \u201cBest sleep I\u2019ve had since I was knocked out on my way to kill the mayor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve chuckled dryly. \u201cYou got it.\u201d He started to turn towards the door but paused, seeing something on the wall. Bucky followed his gaze to where he\u2019d taped Steve\u2019s sorry-for-being-a-dick note, and he felt his face heat up. Steve turned towards him. \u201cYou hung up my apology cartoon?\u201d he asked incredulously, a faint smile curling his lips.\n\u00a0\nBucky looked away and shrugged. \u201cYeah, so?\u201d he said challengingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s real nice, Buck. Thanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo on your run,\u201d Bucky said, waving Steve away. \u201cBeat Sam\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed happily and bounded out the room.\n\u00a0\nBucky fell back onto his bed and blew out a long breath, letting his eyes fall shut to try and erase the image of Steve\u2019s muscular legs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky convinced Steve to watch the modern Star Trek movies that had Chris Pine, and they were lounging on the couch in their normal position: Bucky sitting against the arm of the couch with his feet shoved under Steve\u2019s thigh.\n\u00a0\nSteve shifted slightly, and Bucky looked over at him. He stretched a little, and then deliberately moved so that he was now lying sideways on the couch, body squeezed between Bucky and the cushions. Steve slung an arm across Bucky and kept nudging him until Bucky rolled his eyes and settled back so that Steve was basically spooning him on the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy feet,\u201d Bucky complained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe icicles?\u201d Steve asked dryly, before he clamped his legs around Bucky\u2019s feet. \u201cBetter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky hummed in affirmation, snuggling back into Steve\u2019s broad chest.\n\u00a0\nNothing else was said on the matter, and Bucky was stupidly pleased with the whole turn of events.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe new sleeping situation was great.\n\u00a0\nNot perfect, obviously. Bucky still woke up with nightmares and stared into space, counting the seconds, until the clock ticked to 8:13. Steve had nightmares of his own as well, and he almost never fell back asleep after he woke up.\n\u00a0\nBut it was so much better than the situation before: Bucky watching the house show more than closing his eyes while Steve watched the exits and cleaned his guns.\n\u00a0\nBucky decided that cuddling with Steve was an experience akin to reaching nirvana.\n\u00a0\nReasons: warmth, muscles, Steve\u2019s snuffly sleep noises, and the undeniable feeling of safety.\n\u00a0\nAlthough the one con of the situation was that Bucky\u2019s inner monologue wouldn\u2019t stop screeching. It was kind of annoying, but definitely worth it.\n\u00a0\nSteve seemed pretty satisfied with the whole thing too, if the slightly alleviated dark circles and more cheerful mornings were anything to go by.\n\u00a0\n(If Bucky was still asleep when Steve got up for his run, he\u2019d grumble irritably and swat at Steve. Steve would just giggle and run his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair, which was a surefire way of lulling him back to sleep. It was nice.)\n\u00a0\nBucky was still hazy with sleep as Steve disentangled himself from Bucky and climbed out of bed. Bucky mumbled something indistinct, and Steve laughed softly. \u201cWhat was that, Buck?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a hundred days at 8:13,\u201d Bucky informed Steve sleepily.\n\u00a0\nSteve dropped a kiss onto Bucky\u2019s forehead, and Bucky didn\u2019t think Steve was even aware that he\u2019d done it. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled, and let himself drift back to sleep as Steve combed his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\nMaybe this was what home felt like.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was sitting at Sam\u2019s counter while Sam tried a new recipe for some sort of fancy cake. Bucky was here for emotional support and taste testing. Also: gossip.\n\u00a0\n(Something Bucky never thought he would avidly participate in when he was forced to move to suburbia.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony\u2019s finally getting his clean energy thing off the ground. We\u2019ve got a mutual friend, James Rhodes, who I actually think is Tony\u2019s best friend but I\u2019m not sure. Anyway, Rhodey is helping spread the word, and now Tony has a bunch of investors. A lot of them are enemies of Stark Industries, and you can imagine how ecstatic Tony is at that,\u201d Sam chattered as he poked the cake batter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s great for him,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cI may have pushed him a little bit on that. Remember when I was being a dick when Steve was gone for ten days?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam nodded, smirking faintly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t that bad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shook his head. \u201cI literally told Tony to get off his ass. God, I\u2019m such a bad friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNaw, you\u2019re helping him achieve his dreams.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam sniffed the cake and shrugged a little. Bucky played with his wedding ring. \u201cDid you hear that Kate\u2019s going to NYU for college?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam said warmly. \u201cDid you hear her dad isn\u2019t paying for it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you hear Clint and Natasha are helping her pay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam nodded. \u201cI think Kate really wants to work for this on her own, though. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of that kid,\u201d Bucky admitted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSame.\u201d Sam opened the oven and shoved the soon-to-be-cake inside. \u201cSo, how are things with you and Steve?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky couldn\u2019t help bit grin. God, he was so pathetic. Even the mention of Steve made him smile. What the hell. \u201cThings are great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cSo many cuddles.\u201d Every night. And sometimes multiple times throughout the day, depending on their moods (because bad days were definitely a regular occurrence and cuddles were not always appreciated).\n\u00a0\n\u201cGross,\u201d Sam said, wrinkling his nose.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCuddles sustain me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGroooosssss.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky giggled a little bit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, you two are so dumb and in love, and it sickens me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky agreed happily, but he immediately froze. He hadn\u2019t even thought about the whole thing with Steve being an undercover agent in that moment. Bucky\u2019d just blindly agreed to being in love, like a reflexive response.\n\u00a0\nBucky thought about it hard for a long moment: how incredibly fond he felt every time Steve was in the room or any time he was even mentioned, how his heart leapt whenever the casual touching seemed even slightly deliberate, how his body went fuzzy every time Steve smiled or looked at Bucky affectionately.\n\u00a0\nShit.\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned, dropping his head onto the counter. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d Sam asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSam,\u201d Bucky groaned. \u201cI\u2019m in love with my husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe could practically hear Sam\u2019s smile. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with my husband,\u201d Bucky despaired, banging his head lightly on the counter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should ask him out,\u201d Sam deadpanned.\n\u00a0\nBucky lifted his head to look at Sam mournfully. \u201cMan, this sucks.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam rolled his eyes and patted Bucky consolingly on the head. \u201cYou\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky made a truly pitiful noise but didn\u2019t comment further on the subject, and soon Sam was talking about sending some of the vets over to Natasha\u2019s studio to teach them ballet.\n\u00a0\nBucky and Sam finished the entire cake in under ten minutes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he returned home that night, Steve was painting in the living room, clothes rumpled and splattered with paint.\n\u00a0\nOh no.\n\u00a0\nSteve turned, beaming when he saw Bucky.\n\u00a0\nOh no.\n\u00a0\nThere was a streak of blue paint across his cheek.\n\u00a0\nOh dear god no.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow was Sam?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky said, trying not to sound strangled.\n\u00a0\nSteve grinned, gesturing towards his canvas. \u201cI\u2019ve been painting.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI love you, Bucky\u2019s internal monologue screamed. He furiously ignored it. \u201cI can see that. You have a little...\u201d Bucky touched his own cheek.\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, let me get it,\u201d Bucky offered, stepping into the kitchen to wet a paper towel before he walked into Steve\u2019s space and stroked the paper towel down Steve\u2019s cheek slowly. \u201cThere,\u201d he whispered, but his touch lingered.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes were burning into him, and as Bucky let himself give in to eye contact, his breath caught.\n\u00a0\nSteve was staring at him intently, and Bucky could swear he saw heat flashing through his heavy gaze. Steve reached out and loosely circled his fingers around Bucky\u2019s wrist.\n\u00a0\nBucky licked his lips, and Steve\u2019s eyes flicked down and back up.\n\u00a0\nThe fucking doorbell rang.\n\u00a0\nBucky jumped away. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d he declared, voice strained. Steve watched him with a slight frown as Bucky staggered inelegantly for the door, tripping over the rug as he went.\n\u00a0\nSmooth, Barnes, his inner monologue noted.\n\u00a0\nNatasha was at the door with Liho on her shoulder, and Bucky kind of wanted to strangle her. \u201cGame night,\u201d she declared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGame night,\u201d Bucky repeated.\n\u00a0\nNatasha nodded solemnly. \u201cClint and I have Cards Against Humanity, Apples to Apples, Furt, Pictionary, and Monopoly.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing at least one. I highly suggest Furt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe fuck is Furt?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never played it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I have. Loads of times. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStevie!\u201d Bucky called.\n\u00a0\nSteve padded into the foyer. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNat\u2019s forcing us into a game night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds fun,\u201d Steve said agreeably.\n\u00a0\nHe could not have been more wrong.\n\u00a0\nThey ended up playing Monopoly, which was only a good idea for home wreckers.\n\u00a0\nAnd as it turned out, Steve was competitive enough that he treated board games like wartime strategy. Tony was just as stubborn to win, Clint literally could care less about the actual rules of the game, and Natasha only liked playing to embarrass everybody else and kept trying to steal money. Sam and Bucky were the only sane people, and that meant that they were in dead last place. Clint had been named the banker but had been \u201cbanished\u201d to play with Lucky and Liho.\n\u00a0\nThe only reason Steve and Tony didn\u2019t come to blows by the end of the night was because while they were too busy being competitive/stubborn assholes, Natasha gleefully slipped under their radar and won (probably through cheating).\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe should do this again,\u201d Natasha said cheerfully, celebrating her win as she leafed through her paper money, and Steve and Tony glared in shock.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey almost punched each other,\u201d Bucky said incredulously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony piped up, slinging an arm over Steve\u2019s shoulders (which was really awkward since Tony was half a foot shorter). \u201cStevie-kins knows it\u2019s all in good fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve glared sullenly, clearly still not over the game. \u201cI will end you, Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony stepped away and raised his hands. \u201cHey, let\u2019s call it a truce and watch Star Wars.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve still hasn\u2019t seen the prequels,\u201d Bucky said helpfully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe prequels suck,\u201d Clint whined. Apparently he had turned his hearing aids back on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEpisode III is okay,\u201d Sam said with a shrug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo watch Episode III, we must watch Episodes I and II,\u201d Tony announced.\n\u00a0\nBucky leaned against Steve, and felt his husband\u2019s muscles relax. He smiled faintly to himself as Steve rested his chin on top of Bucky\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMovie marathon it is, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey moved to Tony\u2019s house because Clint had lost his DVD for Attack of the Clones, and Tony had more couches.\n\u00a0\nClint, Natasha, and Sam took one couch, and Steve, Bucky, and Tony took the other. Bucky laid down with his head in Steve\u2019s lap and his feet shoved under Tony\u2019s legs because dammit his feet were always cold. Tony didn\u2019t seem to mind, though, and Steve kept playing with his hair, which was some A+ shit.\n\u00a0\nBucky glanced up at Steve during one of the dull parts of The Phantom Menace, and his inner monologue was at it again: I love you I love you I love you I love-\n\n\u00a0\n\nBucky dug his fingernails into his palms. This wasn\u2019t good. This was definitely not good.\n\u00a0\nSteve glanced down at him to catch his gaze and smiled warmly. Bucky wanted to die. Instead, he turned his head and pressed a kiss to Steve\u2019s thigh because they were around their neighbors (friends?) and married people behavior was excusable.\n\u00a0\nSteve moved his hand from Bucky\u2019s hair to lightly stroke his face, and Bucky\u2019s eyes fluttered shut, but Steve moved back to his hair after a moment.\n\u00a0\nThis was going to be a problem.\n\u00a0\nThey climbed into bed that night, and just like any other night, Bucky snuggled onto Steve\u2019s chest, but his heart was hammering.\n\u00a0\nSteve must\u2019ve felt it, because he whispered, \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky nodded and squeezed his eyes shut.\n\u00a0\nBut he didn\u2019t get any sleep that night.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsk for Dr. Malcolm Ducasse,\u201d Sam had said in what Bucky assumed was his therapist voice.\n\u00a0\nSteve had offered to come with him to the appointment, but Bucky begged for him to stay home. This was something he wanted to do by himself.\n\u00a0\nMalcolm greeted Bucky with a sympathetic smile and kind eyes. \u201cMr. Rogers, how are you feeling today?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged. \u201cPretty okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMalcolm nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get started with any questions you have for me before we begin.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky hesitated, shifting on the comfortable couch across from Malcolm\u2019s chair. \u201cI just heard about you from my friend, Sam.\u201d Malcolm nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about therapists. Do you guys have, like, specialties? Like, certain areas of trauma you focus on?\u201d Bucky asked uncertainly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot all therapists do, but mostly, yeah,\u201d Malcolm answered. \u201cI usually am most effective when paired with people recovering from drug addiction, but I\u2019m flexible.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed, hearing his throat click. \u201cI\u2019ve- uh- I\u2019ve sort of experienced a lot of... of bad things?\u201d he said, and the statement came out sounding like a question. He cringed.\n\u00a0\nMalcolm shifted. \u201cOkay. We can discuss what you want to gain with these sessions,\u201d he said gently.\n\u00a0\nBucky ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI want to stop being so scared all the time,\u201d he murmured, not looking at Malcolm.\n\u00a0\nWhen he finally gathered the courage to look up, Malcolm was smiling faintly. \u201cI think we can work at that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky spoke with Sam on the phone on the way back home. \u201cHow was Dr. Ducasse?\u201d Sam asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSurprisingly approachable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Thank you, Sam.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe could hear Sam\u2019s smile. \u201cNo problem, Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Bucky got home, he immediately knew that something was wrong.\n\u00a0\nIt was too quiet- the type of quiet that felt deliberate.\n\u00a0\nBucky reached for a gun that wasn\u2019t there, and closed the front door softly behind him, even though whoever was in the house definitely already knew he was there.\n\u00a0\nHe eyed the safe in the living room, but he didn\u2019t know the combination. The only weapons he could immediately access were knives from the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nBucky took his chance and grabbed four knives on silent feet.\n\u00a0\nBucky heard a noise that sounded suspiciously like a hiss of pain and ran upstairs as quickly as possible.\n\u00a0\nBucky took a steadying breath outside Steve\u2019s closed bedroom door (which was more of a studio than a bedroom nowadays). It had been a hundred and twenty-six days, seven hours, and forty-two minutes. Bucky was free, Bucky was calm, Bucky was ready.\n\u00a0\nHe kicked the door open.\n\u00a0\nA silencer muffled the blast of the gun, and Bucky reflexively ducked behind the door for cover, but the bullet hadn\u2019t been aimed at him.\n\u00a0\nSteve gasped in pain.\n\u00a0\nBucky burst back into the room, throwing his first knife in the direction of the man with the gun. It hit him in the neck, and Bucky turned away before he saw the bloodshed, eyes searching for Steve.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t hard to find.\n\u00a0\nHe was half-collapsed against a man dressed in tactical gear, face streaked with blood. His knee was a mess of exposed tendons and bone and blood, and Bucky swallowed down the urge to vomit. They\u2019d shot Steve in the fucking kneecap. They\u2019d blown out his kneecap.\n\u00a0\nA dozen guns were pointed at Bucky, and three more were pointed at Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJames Barnes,\u201d a man drawled almost lazily. \u201cYou\u2019ve been pretty tricky to find. Scrappy little maggot, you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet go of him,\u201d Bucky growled, jerking his head in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cHe has nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s FBI, right? They\u2019ve been giving us some problems lately,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe should kill him. Or maybe take you both, I dunno. Haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked delirious with pain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbled, and when he opened his mouth, blood dribbled onto his chin. He spat another thick wad of blood on the floor.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s knives were raised, but he wasn\u2019t going to delude himself. Fifteen guys with guns against a guy with knives and a guy with a blown-out kneecap didn\u2019t exactly inspire good odds.\n\u00a0\nBut the guy who\u2019d shot Steve was at his feet, his gun in reach. As quickly as he could, he snatched the gun, and clicked the safety off, pressing the barrel to his own temple.\n\u00a0\nAll of the safeties in the room clicked off in rapid succession.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need me alive,\u201d Bucky said coldly, finger playing with the trigger.\n\u00a0\nThe man bared his teeth. \u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d Bucky said, and put the slightest amount of pressure on the trigger.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s not be hasty!\u201d the man shouted, and Bucky eased off the trigger, pleased. Steve\u2019s breathing had gone ragged. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky jerked his head in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cYou let him go. Alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man rolled his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously expect us to-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou either get two dead men or one live one. Your choice,\u201d Bucky snapped. \u201cIf you lay one more finger on him, I swear to god, I\u2019ll blow my fucking brains out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man growled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want that, do we? You need me because I\u2019m already reactive to the drugs, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, nobody ever accused Detective Barnes of stupidity,\u201d the man said icily. \u201cLet the FBI rat go,\u201d he commanded as if bored.\n\u00a0\nSteve collapsed to the floor. \u201cBucky,\u201d he breathed hoarsely.\n\u00a0\nWith the gun still pressed to his temple, Bucky crouched down and cradled the side of Steve\u2019s face tenderly. \u201cHey, it\u2019s gonna be okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI promised-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cChange of plans,\u201d Bucky whispered, brushing his thumb over Steve\u2019s bottom lip. He closed his eyes briefly before whispering. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes widened, swimming with tears from either pain or emotion. \u201cBuck-\u201c Before he could say anything to break his heart, Bucky slammed the hilt of his knife down on Steve\u2019s head, and Steve crumpled. Bucky brushed a sweaty lock of hair off of Steve\u2019s forehead.\n\u00a0\nBucky sniffled a little bit before straightening.\n\u00a0\nThe man whistled. \u201cRuthless.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to see,\u201d Bucky ground out. \u201cMy condition still stands. Don\u2019t fucking touch him. I want to see all of you leave this house.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man nodded, roughly grabbing Bucky\u2019s arm. \u201cI could probably get away with killing the FBI rat,\u201d he noted mildly, \u201cbut I\u2019m a sucker for doomed romance. Lead the way, boys.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky watched grimly as the men trooped out of the room, he and the leader following at the end of the line.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m Brock Rumlow, by the way,\u201d the man said conversationally. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably get to know each other intimately. I wonder if you\u2019ll remember.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s stomach clenched with anxiety. He closed his eyes for a moment before opening them, making sure everyone was out of his home and into shady black vans before he followed Rumlow into the last van.\n\u00a0\nRumlow held his hand out, and Bucky offered him the gun. He handcuffed Bucky\u2019s wrists to the car door \u201cas a precaution,\u201d and they were off.\n\u00a0\nBucky stared out the window. He\u2019d lasted a hundred and twenty-six days, but he was going back.\n\u00a0\nHe may never be a free man again, but Steve was alive.\n\u00a0\nHe closed his eyes. Steve was alive.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPierce visited him in his cell. \u201cDetective Barnes,\u201d he said with the arctic smile, clasping his hands behind his back, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne hundred and twenty-six days,\u201d Bucky informed him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute- you\u2019ve been keeping count.\u201d Pierce leaned casually against the bulletproof glass that enclosed his cell. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat until you showed up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coy, Detective.\u201d Pierce raised an eyebrow. \u201cI hear you went into witness protection. Buchanan Rogers? I can\u2019t believe you used your middle name. That was an unnecessary risk,\u201d Pierce chided.\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe information you gave the FBI has made things slightly more difficult for the organization, but you know me. I\u2019m resilient.\u201d Pierce\u2019s tone was dry. Bucky wanted to kill him. \u201cAnd- good news- we\u2019ve almost perfected the memory drug.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFound a better name for it yet?\u201d Bucky asked, trying to find his sarcasm.\n\u00a0\nPierce chuckled. \u201cWhy do you care? You\u2019re not going to remember.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tensed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to the doctor we have working on it. He\u2019s quite charming. I think you two will get along. In the meantime, I believe Agent Rumlow and you have some bonding exercises planned.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRumlow stepped into view, rolling his neck and shifting his weight.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRumlow enjoys bringing out the worst in people. He likes taking them to the brink of death slowly. I\u2019m sure his methods will be more effective than our last attempt of conditioning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you need conditioning for?\u201d Bucky asked, trying to keep the waver out of his voice as Rumlow stepped forward. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to wipe my memory anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPierce\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cDetective, you have no idea.\u201d Bucky shivered involuntarily. \u201cHave fun, boys,\u201d Pierce called as he strolled away, whistling.\n\u00a0\nRumlow smirked. \u201cBarnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRumlow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe first punch was like getting hit by a truck.\n\u00a0\nSome indeterminate amount of time later, Bucky lay on the floor, coughing up blood, completely disoriented. Rumlow watched him, bored. \u201cBroken arm, cracked ribs, dislocated jaw, broken nose, bruised trachea, fractured wrist,\u201d somebody listed.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s head lolled to the side to see a man who had the grimy look of a prisoner, his hair dark and greasy, and his skin pale and bruised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTreat the wounds,\u201d Rumlow commanded.\n\u00a0\nThe man stilled. \u201cYou do know I\u2019m only licensed as a field medic, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nRumlow lifted a shoulder. \u201cNot my problem, Wilson.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSame last name as Sam,\u201d Bucky mumbled, numb with pain.\n\u00a0\nThe man froze and looked at Bucky intently. \u201cSam? Sam Wilson? Therapist? Former pararescue? Super attractive?\u201d he demanded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky coughed. His throat felt like it was burning. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man gritted his teeth as he examined Bucky\u2019s ribs. \u201cHe\u2019s my husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re Riley.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRiley nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo talking,\u201d Rumlow barked, and they fell silent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe thinks you left him,\u201d Bucky breathed when Rumlow pulled out his phone and started scrolling.\n\u00a0\nRiley flinched. \u201cI expect he does. But is he okay? Healthy? Eating well?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s okay. And you do know he stress-bakes, right? Of course he\u2019s eating well.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA ghost of a smile touched Riley\u2019s lips. \u201cThat man.\u201d He looked at Bucky. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI moved to the neighborhood.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. How\u2019s everybody else?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine. Kate\u2019s going to NYU.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAtta girl.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Tony just got sponsored by this big company for his clean energy thing, and the CEO personaly visited him for the endorsement, and I think Tony\u2019s in love with her.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRiley\u2019s lips twitched upwards. \u201cMan, I gotta tell-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d Rumlow snapped, leaning forward and pocketing his phone. \u201cYou know what, Wilson. Forget about the injuries. Let him stew in \u2018em for a couple of days. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRiley gritted his teeth and let some guards shove him from the cell. Rumlow crouched down next to Bucky and smoothed a threatening hand through his sweaty hair. \u201cGotta learn to listen, baby,\u201d he murmured lowly. Then, he abruptly stood and strolled from the room. He must\u2019ve clicked a button because the bulletproof glass turned black, and Bucky was submerged into darkness, injuries screaming at him until he passed out from pain.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky had no idea how long Rumlow left him alone in the dark.\n\u00a0\nIt was especially terrible because when he was lucid, there was no way to count the moments. He had lost all sense of time, and his skin crawled with dread every time he woke up.\n\u00a0\nHis various injuries were swollen and probably ugly and infected. The neglect of his aching body could not be good, and Bucky hated every unaccountable second of it.\n\u00a0\nBut it was worth it. Steve was alive, and that was all that mattered. Maybe his kneecap had even reconstructed itself by now. Steve\u2019s healing was incredible like that.\n\u00a0\nThe dark and the silence ate at him until Bucky thought he was going insane.\n\u00a0\nAnd time continued to slip away-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first words Bucky heard since Rumlow left him in darkness were a meek, \u201cHi, I\u2019m here for some blood samples?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky pried his swollen eyes as far open as he could, and was blinded by the brightness. He hissed at the instant headache, but he couldn\u2019t move.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, jeez,\u201d the same voice said, alarmed. \u201cYou look like absolute shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky groaned indistinctly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of doctor, but I\u2019ll see if I can do anything to help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Bucky rasped, and his jaw screamed. Thank god Riley had popped it back into place before he left, or it would be so much worse. \u201cRumlow wants it this way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d the man said. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see if I can be sneaky.\u201d Bucky heard him enter the cell, and he tried to make out the man\u2019s features. He got the vague impression of dark curls and glasses before his eyes slid shut. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Bruce Banner,\u201d Bruce said quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Bucky mumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Bruce said in amusement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI live in your house.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky could feel Bruce\u2019s gaze on him. \u201cSmall world,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cHow\u2019s Tony?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed, and it felt like sandpaper scraping against his throat. \u201cKicking off his clean energy shit. Pretty successful so far. Half in love with Pepper Potts. Misses you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce didn\u2019t reply, but Bucky felt a prick in his forearm, so he assumed he was concentrating on drawing blood. \u201cGood for him,\u201d he finally managed. \u201cThe others?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPretty good. Sam misses Riley.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bruce agreed. \u201cRiley went missing a few weeks before me. Sam was frantic. I can\u2019t imagine how he must feel. You know, Riley almost died in the military.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Bucky said because he couldn\u2019t say anything else.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Sam is fairly overprotective,\u201d Bruce continued. \u201cI hope Riley gets home to him soon. I don\u2019t think Hydra needs him much anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHydra?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the name of the organization. Shady, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happens when they\u2019re done with Riley?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce paused. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Another prick in his forearm. \u201cThey tried the memory drug on him, and it wasn\u2019t receptive. They\u2019ve tried it on others too. None of them were ever as receptive as you, and they\u2019re getting desperate.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI made things as hard for them as I could.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, good job on that,\u201d Bruce said mildly. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m making the drug as effective as possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Bucky muttered.\n\u00a0\nBruce put a fucking Band-Aid over the injection site on his forearm. As if that was the worst of his injuries. The gesture was surprisingly touching, though. \u201cThey\u2019ve got drones on Tony, in my defense. They\u2019ll kill him if I refuse.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you, Hydra,\u201d Bucky slurred, considerably more disoriented than he had been a minute ago.\n\u00a0\nBruce patted him carefully on the cheek. \u201cI snuck you some morphine,\u201d he whispered so that only Bucky could hear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThaaaannnkkkkkssssssss,\u201d Bucky managed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I\u2019m the one responsible for the perfected memory drug.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot your fauuuuult,\u201d Bucky announced. \u201cI forgive you.\u201d He was stumbling over his words, either from pain or from the morphine.\n\u00a0\nBruce patted his cheek again and left the cell.\n\u00a0\nBucky drifted into unconsciousness.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLittle bitch.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky had learned that Rumlow was fond of giving nicknames.\n\u00a0\nAnd not the endearing sort of nicknames either.\n\u00a0\nBucky blacked out for a second, coming to as Rumlow hauled him up by the torn collar of his shirt. \u201cYou like that, you cocksucker?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looked at Rumlow blearily. He knew better than to struggle.\n\u00a0\nRumlow slammed him against the wall hard enough to rattle hit bones (the broken ones howled). \u201cTenacious,\u201d Rumlow commented, grabbing a fistful of Bucky\u2019s hair to yank his head forward before slamming it back into the wall. Bucky cried out. \u201cBut not unbreakable.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky bit down a whimper, even though it wasn\u2019t like he had any pride left. He\u2019d pissed his pants not half an hour ago, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\u00a0\nRumlow traced a nail down his cheek with deceptive lightness. Bucky let the whimper burble past his lips, and Rumlow smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was disturbing- the way Brock talked to him almost like a lover.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well,\u201d Rumlow murmured, and now his nail was digging in to Bucky\u2019s skin hard enough to leave angry scratches. \u201cTake it like the little bitch you are.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat was what Bucky was doing, wasn\u2019t it? It was difficult to feel guilty about it, though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen more of you than your FBI rat has,\u201d Rumlow went on. \u201cDoes that bother you, baby?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky bared his teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want me to talk about him? Shhhhh, it\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t lay a finger on your precious FBI rat.\u201d Rumlow\u2019s hand closed around his throat. \u201cToo pretty for my taste anyways.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Bucky rasped.\n\u00a0\nRumlow sneered, tightening his hold. \u201cAm I striking a nerve?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019d crush you like a bug,\u201d Bucky choked out.\n\u00a0\nAnger flashed through Rumlow\u2019s features before he eased back, smoothing Bucky\u2019s filthy shirt down. Bucky\u2019s senses went on high alert. Rumlow played with the collar of his shirt for a moment before yanking down and tearing the fabric, leaving Bucky bare-chested.\n\u00a0\nThe bruises over his ribs looked worrying, but Rumlow didn\u2019t pay them any attention, instead inspecting Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201cWhich hand do you shoot with?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky clamped his mouth shut.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThrow knives with?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky remained silent.\n\u00a0\nRumlow looked up. \u201cOh, that\u2019s cute. If you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll hurt something you may need. Which arm is more important?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky watched Rumlow for a moment before whispering, \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d Rumlow said, stroking his cheek. He whipped out a wicked-looking knife and turned over Bucky\u2019s left palm. \u201cGood boy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe first gash was shallow but long, extending from Bucky\u2019s wrist to his inner elbow. Bucky\u2019s knees buckled with white-hot pain, and he fell to the floor.\n\u00a0\nRumlow just shifted his stance slightly, carving careful rings of blood around his bicep in a way that looked almost artistic. Bucky\u2019s vision blurred, and he choked on a sob.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, hurts, doesn\u2019t it, baby?\u201d Rumlow crooned. \u201cMaybe next time you won\u2019t talk back to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDimly, Bucky saw Rumlow pull a lighter out of his pocket and flick the flame on, holding it to heat his blade.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t want you to bleed out,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a clean blade, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe pressed the burning flat of the knife to each gash in order to cauterize the wounds.\n\u00a0\nAnd Bucky screamed until his voice gave out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat was probably days later, Bucky woke up in a sterile room with all of his wounds treated.\n\u00a0\nHe looked down at himself in confusion. He even looked clean. He had a fresh change of clothes and could see the natural color of his skin without looking through layers of blood, vomit, piss, and dirt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re prepping you,\u201d Bruce explained, and Bucky jumped, pulse skyrocketing. \u201cSorry- didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d Bruce stepped into view, holding up gloved hands. \u201cThey want you to be ready to assassinate ASAP, and I\u2019m pretty much done.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky swallowed heavily, nodding in resignation. \u201cWhen is it gonna happen?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Bruce said gently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know I\u2019d never blame you for any of this,\u201d Bucky said quietly, trying to sit up without hurting his aching ribs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Detective Barnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, can I ask you a favor?\u201d Bucky said, stomach twisting with nerves.\n\u00a0\nBruce nodded. \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna forget- everything,\u201d he said, wincing when his voice broke. \u201cI just want to talk to someone about what I may never remember. It\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of doctor either, but I can listen as a friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo, Bucky told Bruce about Rebecca Barnes and how he\u2019d probably never see her again. He told him about his private detective business, and how his neighbor sometimes helped him out, even though she was a broken alcoholic who jumped to anger too easily. He told him about moving to suburbia and meeting his invasive neighbors. But most of all, he told him about Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows him,\u201d Bucky confessed quietly. Bruce was working on the drug and listening at the same time. They both ignored the heavily armored guards in the room. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody ever thought there was anything to know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou care about him a lot,\u201d Bruce noted, not sounding distracted despite looking like he was doing eight things at once.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love him,\u201d Bucky said with a shrug. \u201cHe knows. I don\u2019t know how he feels, though.\u201d He looked up at Bruce. \u201cHey, do me a favor? Erm- another favor?\u201d Bruce gave him an amused glance. \u201cIf you ever run into Steve, tell him I still do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will,\u201d Bruce agreed quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope you get back home,\u201d Bucky whispered drowsily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou too, James.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPierce breezed into the room. \u201cEverything set, doctor?\u201d he asked Bruce.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d Bruce said, stepping away and handing Pierce a bottle of fluid. \u201cJust inject into the neck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPierce shot Bucky a look. \u201cDo I have to restrain you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Bucky said, lifting his chin in a last flimsy show of defiance.\n\u00a0\nPierce chuckled dryly and nodded at the guards, who immediately wrestled Bucky back onto the table he\u2019d been sitting on, strapping his arms and legs down.\n\u00a0\nPierce appeared above him, his eyes cold and blue as ever. \u201cI hope to never see you again, Detective.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLikewise,\u201d Bucky gritted out.\n\u00a0\nPierce pushed the needle into Bucky\u2019s neck and pressed down on the plunger.\n\u00a0\nFor a minute, Bucky felt cold.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d Pierce asked.\n\u00a0\nBucky laughed giddily. \u201cNice try, motherfucker. Didn\u2019t work,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGive it a minute,\u201d Bruce said warily.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked and felt the telltale beginnings of fog descending on his mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned in confusion, looking around. \u201cWhen\u2019d I get here?\u201d he asked groggily.\n\u00a0\nPierce sighed. \u201cDr. Banner, please hand me another syringe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d have to highly advise against administering another dose,\u201d Bruce said frantically. Bucky blinked slowly. \u201cThe effects could be fatal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnother,\u201d Pierce snapped. Bucky felt another needle bite into his neck. \u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d he mumbled. \u201cHow\u2019d I get-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cGive it a moment,\u201d a man\u2019s voice cut in, sounding panicked and strained.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky jerked in his restraints. \u201cI got away!\u201d he shouted hoarsely. \u201cI thought I got away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPierce smirked his arctic smile.\n\u00a0\nBucky blinked again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJames scowled. \u201cWhere the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man with the arctic smile looked at him gleefully.\n\u00a0\nJames blinked slowly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJames opened his mouth in confusion. \u201cI- I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe blinked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-\u201c\n\u00a0\nHe blinked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is the last thing you remember?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe said nothing. His mind was a gaping hole.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Arctic Smile pressed.\n\u00a0\nHe shrugged, noting that he was restrained to a table. Huh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you remember Steve?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe furrowed his brows but shook his head after thinking became increasingly difficult.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you remember your sister?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe had a sister?\n\u00a0\nArctic Smile stood, grinning wide. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You are known as the Soldier.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier\u2019s stomach twisted with unease, but he did not know why.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier tracked the target in his crosshairs before he sighed with the trigger. The bullet hit home, and the target collapsed in a burst of red.\n\u00a0\nSomething muffled and distant within him was screaming, but the Soldier paid it no mind.\n\u00a0\nIt was not mission-relevant.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier carefully arranged the unconscious target in the filled bathtub before leaving long, angry gashes on the target\u2019s wrist, careful with his angle.\n\u00a0\nThe suicide was a footnote in tomorrow\u2019s paper.\n\u00a0\nThe irrelevant part of him was screaming again, but it was easy to ignore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier waited until the target was sleeping in bed before climbing silently into the apartment and slitting her throat.\n\u00a0\nThe target died with a smile frozen on her face, stuck in a pleasant dream for the rest of eternity.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier heard the target\u2019s lover screaming before he had reached sufficient distant.\n\u00a0\nThe irrelevant part of him was weeping.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier killed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier forgot.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier killed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier wavered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier was made to forget.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier killed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier was awaiting the prick of the needle, but Arctic Smile was late, and the irrelevant part of him was progressively getting louder and more demanding.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier was laying back pliantly on his usual table. The lights were dark, and he didn\u2019t think that was normal, but the shifting fog in his mind was making it difficult to concentrate. Immediate administration of memory drug required for maximum efficiency.\n\u00a0\nNO! the irrelevant voice roared. The Soldier frowned. This was the loudest it had ever been.\n\u00a0\nThere was a distant sound of a scuffle, but the Soldier wasn\u2019t moving any time soon. This was the meeting place. Arctic Smile and Handler always met him here, right?\n\u00a0\nThe struggle got closer, and the Soldier tensed, although he did not know what to do. Therefore, he continued to lie down and stare blankly at the ceiling.\n\u00a0\nThere was a loud bang, and the door exploded off its hinges. The Soldier\u2019s muscles coiled even more tightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky?\u201d a voice said.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier lifted his head and saw a man with hair like sunshine and a face like a Greek tragedy. \u201cSteve,\u201d he breathed out, the word coming as muscle memory.\n\u00a0\nSteve approached him, the Greek tragedy on his features crescendoing. He grabbed the Soldier\u2019s shoulder, squeezing tightly. \u201cBucky,\u201d he said again.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier sat up, alert and confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Steve demanded. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier frowned. \u201cPrisoners?\u201d he said tentatively. There was something important about prisoners.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Buck, we got \u2018em. We\u2019re taking them in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier shook his head slightly. \u201cNeighbors?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d Steve said, shifting his hand form the Soldier\u2019s shoulder to the back of his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Soldier snapped, shoving Steve away. There was something important about neighbors and prisoners. \u201cTwo,\u201d the Soldier said, staring intently at Steve. \u201cPrisoners. Neighbors.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s heart broke, and it was visible all over his face. \u201cWe found all the prisoners. I don\u2019t know what you want me to say.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier made a noise of frustration. If only he could make sense of his disjointed half-trains of thought. \u201cMissing neighbors,\u201d he finally bit out, somewhat pleased with his communication skills.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you talking about Bruce Banner and Sam\u2019s husband?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier sagged, relieved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ID any of them. I was- ah- kind of preoccupied,\u201d Steve said, sheepish. \u201cBut we liberated all the prisoners. If those two weren\u2019t among them, I\u2019ll keep looking.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier nodded, satisfied. He suddenly remembered that Arctic Smile and Handler were supposed to meet him. He cocked his head curiously. \u201cAre you here for upkeep?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve recoiled as if he\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdministering the memory drug,\u201d the Soldier explained. \u201cNew dose required. Arctic Smile and Handler are late.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Bucky,\u201d Steve murmured brokenly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m getting you out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier stared at Steve blankly. \u201cOut?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve confirmed, voice breaking. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be free again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA pulsing curiosity ricocheted through the Soldier\u2019s bones, and he blurted out, \u201cHey, do you know what day it is?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve pulled the Soldier to his feet. \u201cNovember twelfth. 5:54 in the evening.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier nodded as if this information was relevant. He let Steve half-carry him from the room because he hadn\u2019t noticed how dizzy he was. \u201cInefficient operation,\u201d the Soldier warned, voice slurring slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Buck. I\u2019ll sling you over my shoulder if I have to,\u201d Steve said through gritted teeth.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier must\u2019ve blacked out because he did not recall much of the rest of his escape.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier sat handcuffed to a gray table.\n\u00a0\nA man sat across from him, glaring. The Soldier didn\u2019t think the expression was personal. He sort of assumed it was just his natural face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDetective Barnes. You\u2019ve had quite the year.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier shrugged.\n\u00a0\nThe man stared at him for a long moment until the Soldier shifted with discomfort.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier scowled. \u201cOf course I can,\u201d he snapped but fell silent. He clenched his fists so that his nails bit into his palms. He swallowed heavily, digging through the muddled contents of his brain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDetective-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d the Soldier growled. \u201cI know my fucking name.\u201d He blinked away tears (where did those come from?) and tried desperately to find his name.\n\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier slumped, shaking his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019re James Buchanan Barnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier relaxed slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you tell me when you were born?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier bit down hard on his lip. He took a shaking breath before shaking his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright. You were born on March 10th.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier stared hard at his handcuffs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you tell me your sister\u2019s name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier furiously scrubbed a tear away before shaking his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRebecca Barnes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man stared at him for a long moment.\n\u00a0\nThen he leaned back and raised his voice slightly. \u201cSend in Agent One.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe only door of the room slid open and the man with sunshine hair and a Greek tragedy face stepped inside. The Soldier let all the tension seep from his muscles. \u201cSteve.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man across the table arched an eyebrow. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve glanced at the man. \u201cSir?\u201d he said, hands twitching at his sides.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPermission to approach,\u201d the man said, watching the Soldier warily.\n\u00a0\nSteve crouched to his knees beside the Soldier\u2019s chair and pressed his face into the Soldier\u2019s side. The Soldier wanted to run his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair, but he was cuffed pretty securely to the table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d the Soldier whispered, trying to nudge Steve gently. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve raised his head and laughed bitterly. \u201cHow could you ask me that? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been gone for two and a half months doing god-knows-what.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier tried for a smile, but it was small and sad. \u201cYou\u2019re being evasive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay now,\u201d Steve said, running his hand down the Soldier\u2019s arm almost reverently. \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for now, Agent One,\u201d the man across the table cut in, and Steve abruptly straightened and stepped away, falling into parade rest. \u201cVery interesting. You\u2019re the only concrete detail he remembers,\u201d the man informed Steve.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s face was too blank. The Soldier scowled again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, Detective. Just one more question for now,\u201d the man said and gave his full attention to the Soldier. \u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Soldier stilled. After a silence that stretched on for several uncertain moments, he whispered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Detective Barnes. That will be all,\u201d the man said.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was shivering.\n\u00a0\nHis body ached all over, muscles crying in pain. His head throbbed horrendously. His limbs quaked involuntarily. He was soaked in sweat.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d been like this before.\n\u00a0\nBucky was handcuffed to the wall in the dark of a grimy cell, curled into the fetal position because his exhausted body had just been wracked with yet another seize. His stomach heaved painfully, and he coughed up bile.\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d been like this before.\n\n\u00a0\nHis mind was dripping with haze, but that much he knew. He wondered how many days had passed. He wondered about the minutes, but then his body started to convulse again, and he could not think much else other than, I need it I need it I need it I need-\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe door clicked and creaked open, throwing a sliver of light into the room. Bucky\u2019s chest heaved with exhausted breaths.\n\u00a0\nSteve stepped inside.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s brain cried out in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 \u2018ere,\u201d Bucky coughed out in a truly pathetic voice.\n\u00a0\nSteve settled down to sit next to him. \u201cLooking after your dumb ass,\u201d Steve explained.\n\u00a0\nBucky frowned and spit out some residue bile from his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Steve whispered, reaching over and combing his fingers through Bucky\u2019s disgustingly sweaty hair.\n\u00a0\nBucky leaned into the touch, and the shudders started again. His teeth chattered. \u201cI need-\u201c he croaked. \u201cI need it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d Steve said firmly. \u201cYou can get through this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re making me!\u201d Bucky shouted, voice hoarse and frantic. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to do this again! I\u2019ve done this before! I\u2019ve fucking done this before!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve made a soft hushing noise and pulled Bucky close so that his head was cradled in Steve\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nBucky choked on a desperate sob. \u201cI can\u2019t do it- I can\u2019t. Just give me more. I know you fucking have it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, Buck,\u201d Steve murmured, and to Bucky\u2019s ears his voice sounded thick with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Bucky sobbed, fingers weakly curling into the fabric of Steve\u2019s pants. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this again. I don\u2019t want-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky could no longer find the words to express his rage and exhaustion and need, so he curled in on himself and cried on Steve\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nAfter he\u2019d thrown up for what felt like the millionth time, Steve stroked a hand down the sweat-soaked fabric of his shirt and whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shuddered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky awoke with enough lucidity to be properly disgusted with himself.\n\u00a0\nThe floor was covered in bile (so were his clothes), he had a good layer of dried sweat going for him, and he\u2019d apparently been gouging his skin with his fingernails.\n\u00a0\nIn short: a huge mess.\n\u00a0\nBut he was curled up on Steve\u2019s lap, and Steve was making these groggy noises that indicated that Bucky\u2019s movements had woken him up. Bucky wanted to sigh with relief- at least the guy had gotten some sleep. He doubted Steve had stopped for shuteye since Bucky had been recaptured. He was stupid and noble like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Steve croaked, voice raw like he had spent the majority of the night crying.\n\u00a0\nBucky winced as he rolled over. He\u2019d never felt grosser. \u201cHey yourself,\u201d he rasped out.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cYou did it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Bucky warned, and Steve frowned. \u201cEven when you moved in with me, I was still getting these flashes of need for the drug.\u201d Bucky sighed tiredly. \u201cSo, it may never be properly over.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve brushed Bucky\u2019s disgusting hair out of his face. \u201cBut the worst is over.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf the withdrawal? Yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve sagged with relief. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go through that again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Bucky deadpanned.\n\u00a0\nSteve grimaced. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult that was for you. Especially having to go through it for a second time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky tried for a shrug, but all of his muscles were cramped. He hissed in pain, and Steve squeezed his shoulder hard enough to leave bruises. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what\u2019s worse,\u201d he mumbled, trying for a light tone but failing, \u201cthe vomit or the convulsions.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think the convulsions, but I wasn\u2019t the one going through it,\u201d Steve said softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey both suck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve hummed in agreement.\n\u00a0\nBucky hesitated. \u201cI assume Fury wants to talk to me?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cI- I don\u2019t remember the names, but I think I could probably remember how I killed them. We could just look over the obituaries from the time I was gone,\u201d he suggested, voice shaking.\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve arrested basically all of Hydra,\u201d Steve told him. \u201cWe have enough evidence to put Alexander Pierce away for several lifetimes. We don\u2019t need more assassinations.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky gritted his teeth. \u201cHow much evidence do you have for Brock Rumlow?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA lot,\u201d Steve said darkly.\n\u00a0\nBucky relaxed slightly. \u201cBut-\u201c he protested faintly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost over.\u201d Steve tried for a smile. \u201cYou can- you can go home soon. Be James Buchanan Barnes again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s internal monologue cried out in distress. For once, Bucky vehemently agreed with it. \u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d Bucky said lowly. \u201cYou sayin\u2019 you don\u2019t want me around anymore?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve froze. \u201cI- what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me if I\u2019m coming way out of left field here,\u201d Bucky began nervously, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to go back to any life that\u2019s a life without you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s eyes were wide. He looked hunted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s- uh- that\u2019s a good point,\u201d he whispered, voice shaking. \u201cI didn\u2019t think-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember my dramatic love confession,\u201d Bucky said dryly, \u201cbut it definitely still applies.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI remember,\u201d Steve said quietly. He swallowed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you remember from this past week, but I told you. I love you too.\u201d Bucky\u2019s insides exploded with incredible warmth. This man would be the death of him.\n\u00a0\nThey sat in silence for a while. Steve continued to run his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair as if it wasn\u2019t the grossest thing on the planet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s gaze went far away. \u201cI think I have an idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteve led Bucky to a shower and gave him a fresh change of clothes that consisted of jeans and a sweatshirt. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you know my style,\u201d Bucky teased, hip-checking Steve as he gingerly took the clothes and tried not to get dried vomit all over them.\n\u00a0\nSteve smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside the door for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Steve said, hunching his shoulders.\n\u00a0\nBucky studied him carefully for a moment before nodding. The shower was scalding bliss. He had no idea if he\u2019d been allowed to shower as the Soldier, but he kind of assumed Rumlow was one to just use a hose.\n\u00a0\nBucky stepped into the hallway, skin damp and raw but clean. The sweatshirt was particularly nice because it continued to hide his left arm from Steve. Steve hadn\u2019t seen the scars yet, and Bucky was breathlessly thankful of that fact.\n\u00a0\nSteve reached for Bucky\u2019s hand and linked their fingers together. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey walked down a few hallways that Bucky had difficulty paying attention to because holding Steve\u2019s hand was super nice, and Bucky was trying to savor it.\n\u00a0\nSteve stopped in front of a door marked DIRECTOR FURY and knocked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEnter,\u201d Fury called.\n\u00a0\nThey did, and Steve didn\u2019t let go of his hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgent One. Nice to see you looking more level-headed,\u201d Fury commented, almost bored. \u201cDetective. Nice to see you not covered in puke.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glared at him. Steve ignored the commentary and said, \u201cSir, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to discuss with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis got Fury\u2019s attention. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve nodded and gave Bucky\u2019s hand a squeeze. \u201cI think we both know that this came to an end a while ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFury laced his fingers. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve glared at Fury with such intensity that even Fury looked vaguely uncomfortable. Then, Steve said lowly, \u201cAgent One died in the siege for Hydra.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgent One started dying a long time ago,\u201d Steve continued, steel in his voice. \u201cBut he died when we sieged Hydra. Killed in action.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFury looked shocked, and Bucky was hugely impressed with Steve for being the one to cause that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve Rogers however,\u201d Steve went on, \u201cwould like to continue to live his life in the suburbs of New York.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFury smiled humorlessly, leaning back in his chair. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgent, you could\u2019ve been the best damn director the agency has ever seen,\u201d he said bluntly, and Steve straightened a little bit. \u201cBut I know you would always hate it, and that kind of subjectivity is not what this agency needs.\u201d Fury leaned over and pressed a button. \u201cHill, can you add to the records that Agent One is KIA.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a lengthy pause. Then, a vaguely confused, \u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make it so easy for you,\u201d Fury warned. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be on my radar, Agent. Never forget that we made you. Never forget where you came from.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s grip on Bucky\u2019s hand was tight. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll warn the Barnes household to look out for you as Buchanan Rogers,\u201d Fury told Bucky, \u201cbut it\u2019s your responsibility to achieve contact. You don\u2019t need our protection anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Bucky muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDismissed,\u201d Fury said, and turned his back on them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen was I free?\u201d Bucky asked, staring at his watch and trying not to tremble.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him. \u201cNovember twelfth. 5:54.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cTwelve days, three hours, and forty minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve pulled him close, and Bucky pressed his face into Steve\u2019s neck, breathing him in. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home in a few hours. We\u2019ll be home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve decided to drive, and Bucky sat in the passenger\u2019s seat, examining the gouges he\u2019d left on his skin during withdrawal. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d he eventually asked.\n\u00a0\nSteve gave him a sidelong glance, then reached over and put his hand on Bucky\u2019s knee. Warmth emanated from that point outwards. \u201cTony saw the license plate of one of the vans, and our paper trail led to the major Hydra base of operations.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow quickly did your knee heal?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shrugged. \u201cI dunno. It wasn\u2019t really the most important thing on my mind,\u201d he said wryly, with a deliberate squeeze of Bucky\u2019s knee.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole with no sense of self preservation,\u201d Bucky declared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you love me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky sighed, sinking down in his seat. \u201cI really do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve beamed at him. \u201cDr. Banner and Mr. Wilson were already sent home,\u201d he told Bucky after a while. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, the reunion was pretty heavy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry to miss it,\u201d Bucky mumbled, propping his feet up on the dashboard, just because he could. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been kind to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re your friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky put his hand on top of Steve\u2019s. Steve smiled but didn\u2019t say anything more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they finally got home, the invasive neighbors were waiting on their front lawn. \u201cThey fuck are you guys doing out here?\u201d Bucky squawked. \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha rolled her eyes. \u201cStop motherhenning,\u201d she snapped, but she was the first to grab Bucky in a bone-crushing hug.\n\u00a0\nAnd suddenly Bucky was surrounded by the first people he\u2019d considered his friends in a long time. He sniffled a little bit, melting into the hugs and maybe clinging a bit, but none of them seemed to care.\n\u00a0\nRiley grabbed him in a particularly suffocating embrace and choked out, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was Steve,\u201d Bucky assured him. \u201cIt was all Steve.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam put his arm around Riley\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cNo, Bucky. It was you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly, Tony\u2019s way of greeting him was by shouting, \u201cI knew Buchanan was a made-up name.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEnough of that, Jamie,\u201d Tony shouted, grabbing him tightly. \u201cThe bae hath returned.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce shook his head before giving Bucky a tentative hug. \u201cSo, I may or may not have slightly sabotaged the memory drug,\u201d he told him. \u201cThey wanted me to permanently wipe your memories. I said it wasn\u2019t possible if they still wanted you to be clear-headed, even though I could totally manage that.\u201d He sounded pleased with himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, thanks, man,\u201d Bucky said happily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJames Bae-chanan Bae-rnes,\u201d Tony was saying. He elbowed Bruce. \u201cDoes that work?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not dead,\u201d Clint announced, clapping him on the back. \u201cSick.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTotally,\u201d Bucky said dryly. \u201cNone of you are mad about the whole lying about our identities thing?\u201d Bucky asked, gesturing between him and Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were a little miffed,\u201d Natasha admitted. \u201cBut we got over it pretty quickly. You know, once we realized you\u2019d been captured by the criminal underground.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky felt overwhelmed, and he leaned back into Steve\u2019s chest for comfort. Steve subconsciously wound an arm around Bucky\u2019s waist to keep him there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh wait!\u201d Tony declared. \u201cYou guys are actually married? I kinda assumed that was part of the cover too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, sounding slightly flustered. \u201cIt was part of the cover.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sam cut in, eyes sparkling with mirth and happiness simultaneously, \u201cyou fell in love anyway. Oh, that\u2019s adorable.\u201d He reached out to offer Bucky a high five, and Bucky reluctantly slapped Sam\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you guys all want to hang out tomorrow?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty exhausted.\u201d Bucky nodded in agreement, dropping his weight more heavily on Steve, who didn\u2019t even budge, the bastard.\n\u00a0\nEverybody agreed and dispersed after more hugs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs there still blood in the studio?\u201d Bucky asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it was cleaned,\u201d Steve said, not meeting his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou cleaned it,\u201d Bucky said incredulously.\n\u00a0\nSteve lifted a shoulder. \u201cYeah. I cleaned it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey made their way to the bedroom, and Bucky let his hand ghost over Steve\u2019s apology cartoon before he kicked off his jeans and climbed into bed.\n\u00a0\nSteve wound his arms around Bucky and pulled him close. \u201cGod, I\u2019m never letting you out of my sight again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky said, tracing the contours of Steve\u2019s perfect face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be the clingiest couple ever,\u201d Steve announced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m oddly on board with that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky leaned in to capture Steve\u2019s lips. The kiss was soft and chaste, but it was genuine. No one was watching. This kiss was just because.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Bucky sighed, resting his forehead against Steve\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d Steve breathed, his eyes fluttering shut.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe nightmares are gonna be really bad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Steve whispered, pressing another kiss to Bucky\u2019s lips just because. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be here for cuddles.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCuddles and kisses.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan\u2019t forget kisses.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut they were both exhausted, and they fell asleep in record time, limbs all twisting together.\n\u00a0\nEven if Bucky woke up no less than eight times that night. It was infinitely better than waking up in a cell.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Steve destroyed everyone else in some game that liked to mimic wartime strategy, Bucky and Steve were promptly banned from Clint and Natasha\u2019s household.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy me too?\u201d Bucky protested.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpousal privilege,\u201d Natasha declared, grinning wolfishly.\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t actually feel bad about it because everyone else was leaving around that time too.\n\u00a0\nSteve was still grinning smugly, his hand linked with Bucky\u2019s, as they got home.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI invited my family over for dinner next weekend,\u201d Bucky told him. \u201cYou could invite your mom too if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Buck,\u201d Steve murmured, letting his eyes trail over Bucky\u2019s body in a way that felt so deliberate that Bucky shivered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBed?\u201d Bucky asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBed,\u201d Steve confirmed.\n\u00a0\nSteve undressed Bucky slowly, letting his hands explore the taut muscles of his stomach before pulling his sweatshirt off in one smooth motion.\n\u00a0\nBucky tensed, watching as Steve\u2019s gaze fell on his left arm.\n\u00a0\nSteve made a pained noise and dropped his head to kiss at the rings of scars around his bicep. His lips were sweet and soft against the pain that Rumlow had caused, and Bucky could only issue a shaky but blissful sigh. Steve traced a hand down Bucky\u2019s chest, just feeling, even as he turned Bucky\u2019s wrist over and kissed at the long scar along his forearm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d Steve asked roughly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBrock Rumlow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve growled and pulled Bucky close almost possessively. \u201cI should\u2019ve killed him,\u201d he said darkly.\n\u00a0\nBucky just shook his head and pulled Steve in for a kiss. Their lips were hot against each other, and Bucky quickly traced his tongue long the seam of Steve\u2019s mouth. Steve opened up without hesitation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShirt,\u201d Bucky mumbled distractedly, tugging at said apparel. Steve leaned back and yanked the shirt off, and Bucky scraped his nails over Steve\u2019s abdomen. Goosebumps rose on his skin, and the muscles twitched.\n\u00a0\nBucky dropped to his knees and fumbled with the buckle of Steve\u2019s motherfucking khakis.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck-\u201c Steve gasped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suck your dick,\u201d Bucky explained calmly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking khakis,\u201d Bucky swore, and yanked the pants down until they were around Steve\u2019s ankles. Steve kicked them off the rest of the way, and Bucky pulled Steve\u2019s underwear down.\n\u00a0\nBucky took Steve in hand, leaned forward, and started giving it his all, but as Steve\u2019s thighs started to tremble, and Steve\u2019s hand tightened in his hair, Steve surprisingly pushed at Bucky\u2019s shoulder, and Bucky immediately pulled off. \u201cDon\u2019t want to,\u201d Steve gasped. \u201cNot yet. Want this to last.\u201d He cradled Bucky\u2019s face as if it were delicate. \u201cWhat do you want, Buck?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky ran his hands up Steve\u2019s thighs, thinking. \u201cI want to do everything with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed happily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut right now I think you should fuck me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking hell, Buck,\u201d Steve groaned. \u201cYeah,\u201d he managed. \u201cI can do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky scrambled to get his jeans off, wincing when the fabric caught on his achingly hard dick.\n\u00a0\nBucky lay on his back and Steve settled between his thighs, letting his hands roam over Bucky\u2019s skin. The contact was glorious, and Bucky knew there was no way he\u2019d ever get tired of this.\n\u00a0\nAnd as Steve moved, little breaths shaking, arms trembling, muscles clenching, Bucky knew he\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful. He hiked his legs up on Steve\u2019s back, marveling at this wonderful man. This wonderful man who nobody had ever thought to know, who knew Bucky maybe more than anyone else, who Bucky knew like the back of his hand.\n\u00a0\nThis wonderful man who had saved his life. Bucky kind of wanted to think that to an extent, he\u2019d saved Steve\u2019s life too.\n\u00a0\nMaybe they\u2019d saved each other.\n\u00a0\nSteve reached over to grab Bucky\u2019s hand, and pressed a reverent kiss to his knuckles. Bucky arched on the bed and tipped over the edge. Steve followed after a few more thrusts, and then collapsed heavily onto Bucky\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\nBucky traced the muscles of Steve\u2019s broad back absentmindedly.\n\u00a0\nSteve hummed. \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled faintly to himself. \u201cWow, Steve... that was... really gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, fuck you,\u201d Steve grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUrgh, fine,\u201d Bucky sighed, pretending to sound exasperated. \u201cJust gimme a minute to get interested again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky felt the vibrations of Steve\u2019s soft laugh. Steve fumbled to prop himself up on an elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d he complained.\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled, stroking the side of Steve\u2019s face. \u201cLove you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve fell back down on Bucky\u2019s chest and hummed again. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said idly, \u201cyou\u2019re the only person in the world who\u2019s made me feel like an actual person.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t know what he could say to that, so he pressed a kiss to the top of Steve\u2019s head. \u201cMore of you for me, then,\u201d he finally whispered.\n\u00a0\nSteve traced the rings of scars around his bicep. \u201cDid these hurt?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve kissed him slowly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t get to you sooner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up. You got to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve sighed, clearly not convinced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnybody else would\u2019ve just given up on me,\u201d Bucky said fiercely, grabbing Steve\u2019s face. \u201cAnybody else.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got friends. They\u2019re all incredibly loyal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re your friends too, and that wasn\u2019t the point.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve blew out a breath. \u201cYeah, I know what your point is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky grabbed Steve\u2019s hand and guided it to trace his scars- old and new. \u201cMy body is a map,\u201d Bucky said, and then moved his hand to press against Steve\u2019s chest- against his steadily beating heart. \u201cYour body is a clean slate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve looked at him, and his gaze was so tender that Bucky couldn\u2019t stop his lips from curling slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I love you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTurns out, naked cuddling with Steve proved to be an even more euphoric experience than regular cuddling with Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeeing his family again was a little wonky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you went back to calling yourself Bucky,\u201d Becca exploded, jabbing him in the ribs.\n\u00a0\nBucky winced.\n\u00a0\nWinifred was already crying as she hugged him and held up a bag from Maria\u2019s Deli. \u201cWe brought you bagels,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI won\u2019t have my boy be subjected to that store-bought crap.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, thanks ma,\u201d Bucky said, trying not to tear up himself as he took the bagels and shot Steve an ecstatic look. Steve just rolled his eyes fondly.\n\u00a0\nGeorge, steadfast as ever, just patted him on the shoulder and nodded.\n\u00a0\nGood talk, dad, his internal monologue drawled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd this must be Steve,\u201d Winifred said, clasping her hands with stars in her eyes.\n\u00a0\nSteve shifted, already uncomfortable with the attention. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNone of that. Call me Winifred.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWinifred,\u201d Steve amended, shooting Bucky a slightly panicked look. Winifred crushed Steve in a hug, and Bucky stifled a laugh at the little squeak of surprise Steve made.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJames, he\u2019s so hot,\u201d Becca stage whispered. \u201cLike, so hot. How did you manage that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shrugged helplessly. \u201cI honestly have no idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShow me your wedding ring,\u201d Winifred demanded, turning on Bucky. Knowing when to pick his battles, Bucky sighed and stuck his hand out. Winifred cooed appreciatively. \u201cAre you two ever going to have a ceremony now that you\u2019re actually together?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve and Bucky exchanged an uncertain glance. \u201cUh. We haven\u2019t really discussed it,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell!\u201d Winifred said, clapping her hands together. Steve jumped. \u201cIf you ever decide you want to, I\u2019ll plan the whole thing! Navy blue would go great with Steve\u2019s-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, thanks, mom,\u201d Bucky said, a little bit too loudly. Becca snickered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go eat bagels?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky didn\u2019t miss George giving Steve a stern look before making the I\u2019m Watching You gesture and following them into the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nSteve looked vaguely bewildered as he sat down next to Bucky. Bucky patted him on the thigh. \u201cWe\u2019re loud,\u201d he explained needlessly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve agreed distantly.\n\u00a0\nBucky and Winifred prepared their bagels in the same exact way, while Becca whined loudly as she rummaged through Bucky\u2019s refrigerator. She eventually yanked out the carton of eggs and started making frittatas.\n\u00a0\nThe doorbell rang, and Steve jumped to his feet, pulling on Bucky\u2019s hand. \u201cThat must be Sarah,\u201d he said, unable to hide his excitement.\n\u00a0\nBucky grinned and followed him to the door.\n\u00a0\nA small woman with pale skin and hair like sunshine stood at the door. As soon as she saw Steve, she hauled him down for a hug. \u201cMy sweet boy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, ma,\u201d Steve breathed, sagging into Sarah\u2019s embrace before he pulled back and gestured behind him. \u201cThis is Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky stuck out a hand to shake, but Sarah batted it away and pulled him in for a hug too. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSarah rolled her eyes. \u201cFor trying to keep his sorry ass out of trouble.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMa!\u201d Steve exclaimed, reddening.\n\u00a0\nSarah and Bucky snickered. \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna get along,\u201d Bucky told her cheerfully. Steve tried to put on a sullen face, but he looked too delighted to pull it off.\n\u00a0\nThe Barnes family embraced Sarah warmly as if they\u2019d known her their entire lives. Bucky complained about Becca\u2019s merciless teasing, but Becca was one of his very favorite people in the world, and it was so transparent in the moment that it would be humiliating if he couldn\u2019t see the same sentiment in Becca.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got a job,\u201d Becca announced. \u201cWhile you were busy slumming it here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Bucky snapped. \u201cI\u2019m in a delicate state.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d George said, slapping him on the back of the head.\n\u00a0\nSteve laughed, eyes crinkling from where he sat next to Sarah. Bucky didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever seen Steve look this happy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd did you hear about the Johnsons?\u201d Winifred was saying in glee. \u201cHenry\u2019s getting arrested for embezzlement.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so happy, mom,\u201d Bucky said with an eye roll.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe hate the Johnsons,\u201d Winifred explained to Steve and Sarah.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn that case, we hate the Johnsons too,\u201d Sarah said.\n\u00a0\nWinifred beamed.\n\u00a0\nBucky sat down next to Steve, leaning heavily into his side.\n\u00a0\nThis felt suspiciously like family.\n\u00a0\nSteve started absentmindedly rubbing circles on his left arm, and Bucky had to blink away tears.\n\u00a0\nBecca caught his eye, and they exchanged a watery smile as Winifred ranted about the Johnsons, George rolled his eyes affectionately, and Sarah listened avidly.\n\u00a0\nAnd Steve. Solid and present. Steve dropped a kiss onto the top of his head, and Bucky sighed happily.\n\u00a0\nBecause yeah. Maybe this was his new family, and maybe Bucky was stupidly happy with the whole thing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky was straddling Steve on the couch and attacking his husband\u2019s neck like he had a score to settle.\n\u00a0\nMaking out with Steve: an A+ experience. 10/10 would recommend.\n\u00a0\nSteve moaned a little bit, running his hands down Bucky\u2019s back with his eyes closed.\n\u00a0\nBucky was trying to see how long he could make a hickey stay visible on Steve\u2019s super-healing skin.\n\u00a0\nThe record so far was four and a half minutes.\n\u00a0\nBut this was Bucky\u2019s pride at stake. He could do better than four and a half fucking minutes.\n\u00a0\nSteve gasped as Bucky continued playing with the skin between his teeth, and Bucky savored the noise. It was possible that he savored every noise Steve made.\n\u00a0\nSteve slipped his hands under the front of Bucky\u2019s shirt and felt the muscle there, shifting his hips slightly and- hello there.\n\u00a0\nThe doorbell rang.\n\u00a0\nBucky pulled away with a groan. \u201cWhy does this always happen?\u201d he whined.\n\u00a0\nSteve smirked lazily, reaching a hand up to touch the latest bruise. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed and moved to stand before he froze. \u201cShit. I have a boner. I can\u2019t go to the door with a boner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThink about gross things,\u201d Steve said, looking at the timer on his watch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Bucky asked frantically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Your grandma\u2019s buttcrack.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Steve?\u201d Bucky snapped.\n\u00a0\nSteve rolled his eyes. \u201cI could just suck you off really quickly,\u201d he suggested mildly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot helping,\u201d Bucky hissed.\n\u00a0\nThe doorbell rang again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHelp!\u201d he squeaked.\n\u00a0\nSteve pursed his lips, wracking his brain. \u201cShit. I don\u2019t fucking know. Khakis. Don\u2019t you hate khakis?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky paused. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve lit up. \u201cAlso. Store-bought bagels.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky shuddered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEating store-bought bagels for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare threaten me, Stevie,\u201d Bucky warned, relaxing as his dick finally started to calm the fuck down.\n\u00a0\nThe doorbell rang again, and Bucky felt safe enough to shuffle to the door after one last appraising glance at the hickey that would probably fade in less than five minutes.\n\u00a0\nNatasha stood at the door, looking bored. \u201cGame night,\u201d she declared. Liho was sitting at her feet, watching Bucky almost accusingly.\n\u00a0\nBucky sighed and turned slightly. \u201cStevie, game night!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shuffled into the foyer, running a hand through his disheveled hair. Bucky noted with no small amount of satisfaction that his hickey was still there. \u201cIs there any routine in the random nights you say are game night?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha frowned. \u201cWhy do we need routine?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Steve said. He smiled at Bucky and pressed a kiss to his temple.\n\u00a0\nBucky smiled back.\n\u00a0\nLater, he had an appointment with Dr. Ducasse. They were going to talk about potential job opportunities for Bucky. Later, Steve would wrap Bucky in his arms, and he wouldn\u2019t pretend to ward off nightmares. He\u2019d just be there when they inevitably occurred. Later, Bucky would press Steve into the sheets and whisper, I love you, over and over again.\n\u00a0\nBut for now, maybe all he needed was game night.\n\u00a0\nIt had been thirty-eight days, twenty hours, and sixteen minutes. Bucky was free.\n\u00a0\nAnd maybe this time, it would be for good."
