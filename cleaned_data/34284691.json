    "text": "\"What the hell are you doing?\" said the last voice Damian wanted to hear right now.\nDamian did not jump, but his teeth clacked together savagely as he confirmed the identity of the intruder in the dim light. He frowned, shivering at the damp wind the new opening brought in.\n\"I am sitting in a box. Why are you not with Batman?\" Drake had seemed  excited  to patrol with Father for the night. What was he doing here without him? Unless...Damian craned his neck, trying to see around the fool, but Red Robin appeared to be operating solo.\nDrake scowled mulishly down at him. \"Funny story. When Batman called Nightwing to rendezvous for the mission he came here for the express purpose of helping us with, he said his sidekick had run off on his own an hour ago. Take a wild guess as to who got put on Robin Retrieval duty tonight.\"\n\"You,\" Damian said, a cold lump of dread settling in his stomach.\nDrake grabbed a fistful of shirt and cape and dragged Damian out of his little crate with one hand, either not noticing or not caring about Damian's uncharacteristic reticence. \"Batmobile's around the corner,\" he grumbled. \"I'm taking you home.\"\nDamian weighed his options. This was better than being caught out by a Rogue or a civilian, and he was not expected to return to the field. Drake was the worst in the line of people willing to help him, but given the circumstances...well. Damian was not the sort to mince words. Perhaps he could get back to the Manor without alerting Drake to his compromised condition. It would be an exercise in espionage, he decided.\nHe crawled into the backseat, sitting as far as possible from the driver. This time, Drake did a double-take. \"What, not gonna pitch a fit about who drives?\"\n\"No,\" Damian said through gritted teeth.\nThat earned him almost-concerned glance as the engine started up. \"Did you get hurt tonight?\"\nDamian huddled into the seat despite himself, wishing Drake would just stop  talking  to him. \"I took a punch to the stomach near the Bowery. I have a hangnail on my right thumb. I fell off a bridge, but did not break any bones. I am a little sore, the way one gets from sitting still for too long,\" he reported robotically, each paltry injury twinging as he listed them off obediently.\nEven with his eyes on the road, Damian knew the bitter, judgemental expression Drake would be wearing so well he could probably  paint  it.\"Then why did you run away from Dick?\"\u00a0\n\"I needed to be somewhere else.\" It was, technically, the truth, and appeared to be enough to satisfy the ache in his stomach. \"I would prefer to complete this ride without conversation.\"\nA derisive snort dashed his chances of that happening. \"Don't be like that, Damian,\" he said, tone just this side of snide. \"We never talk. Maybe I want to talk now.\u00a0 How's elementary school these days?\" Damian scoffed. How childish. How plebeian.\nBut when he opened his mouth to respond with a curt  unsatisfactory,  the word wasn't there. Instead, visions of grubby hands swiping at his belongings and patronizing words and glances from adults who could never  begin  to understand him flashed behind his eyes, and he heard his own voice saying, \"I am deeply unhappy. My classmates do not like me. I do not belong there.\" Damian locks his jaw shut forcefully, holding back any further humiliating elaboration.\u00a0\nDrake, taken aback by Damian's sudden candor, was silent for a moment before responding. When he did, his voice sounded completely different. \"Uh, that sucks.\" He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, antsy with an emotion Damian couldn't identify. \"Maybe you could talk to Dick. About that...or something,\" he trailed off, shoulders creeping up to his ears.\u00a0\nDamian did not dignify this feeble consolation with a response, and instead just  existed  around the burning pit in his stomach. No  just give them time  or  I'm sure it's not your fault, of course. There was no one here for whom they would need to be  precious  about his gross inability to relate to his peers.\u00a0\nWhen he glanced back toward the front of the car, Drake's shoulders were still hunched. Maybe this was better. If Red Robin was so discomfited by evidence of Damian having an actual  opinion  on the way others perceive and treat him, this accursed affliction might smother any further attempts at conversation.\nThey drove in silence for the next few minutes. Damian sat like stone and his breaths were as silent as he could make them. Perhaps Drake would simply forget he was here.\nThe Batmobile had just pulled into the hidden entrance of the cave system. It wouldn\u2019t be long now. If he could just get  home\u2014\n\"All right,\" Drake would not be assailed, and seemed determined to initiate some inane conversation with Damian at any cost. \"Do you want to tell me what inspired you to run off by yourself? Or why you were hiding in a fish crate when I found you?\" It sounded as familiar as it did rehearsed, the way they all talked to Damian when he did something they did not understand. Like he was some kind of idiot. \"Either one's fine.\"\n\"I do not want to tell you,\" Damian answered honestly, in easy unison with the lights in his mind.\u00a0\n\"This is serious, Damian. No one even knew you'd taken off. No one had eyes on you, your tracker was on some random street, and Dick couldn't find you at all; you could have died.\" Drake said, as if reading from a script.\n\"Maybe so, yes.\" he acknowledged. \"However, I do not see how this is  your  problem.\"\n\"God, would it kill you to\u2014\" Drake huffed out an aggrieved sigh and changed his approach. Sparks danced on Damian's tongue at the unfinished question. \"It's the middle of the damn night. I know you hate me or whatever, but I\u2019ve been looking for you for  hours, and...\" he trailed off, shaking his head with a snort. \"Look who I'm talking to. Have you ever felt gratitude towards another person in your miserable little life?\"\nSensations and colors and phantom pains buffeted Damian like a storm at sea, he had to hold it back, he had to\u2014 \"I am grateful you did not kill me upon my arrival in Gotham, although at times I fear you still might want to,\" Damian's traitorous mouth replied for him. Only after he finished speaking did the waves crashing behind his eyes subside.\u00a0\nDrake's hands locked tightly around the wheel for a moment before he visibly forced himself to relax and ground out, \"What are you talking about, Damian,\" His tone was tight and sharp, moving away from annoyance and closer to real anger. \"Well, you can rest easy on that one.\" Contempt. \"Between the two of us, the only murderer around here is you, remember?\"\n You don\u2019t frighten me, Damian tried to say, but of course he could not. \"I remember,\" and that should be enough, he shouldn't need to elaborate, but his mind lit up with beforetimes, his mother and Todd and tales of Robins and the looming, distant spectre of a father Damian had never met, and\u2014\"I was sent here to eliminate Grayson, not you. Todd was supposed to kill you, on my mother's orders. When he failed, and later I failed, I erroneously assumed it was only a matter of time.\"\nDrake slammed on the brakes so suddenly that the snap of Damian's seatbelt against his collarbone was likely to leave a bruise. \"What the FUCK,  Damian,  is that  true!?\" \n\"Yes,\" he gasped, and suddenly could not breathe. They hadn't known; not even an inkling. This was going to ruin  everything. The uneasy truce that allowed him space within this family, where Tim pretended not to despise Damian and Damian pretended not to resent him for it, because  it was his fault, was dashed. Destroyed in a moment. And that was Damian's fault, too.\nMore than that. Batman had not known that Damian was sent here to claw his family apart and build a nest from the grisly remains. What would he do to Damian when he found out?\u00a0\nThe door opposite him swung open and Drake was there, staring him down. He looked angry.\u00a0 He looked disgusted. But most of all, he looked grimly victorious. As though he'd finally been proven right.\n\"Don't tell Father,\" Damian whispered, pressing himself back against the car door, fumbling at the child safety lock. They were still approximately 15 miles from the manor, but he'd run farther while injured worse; if Drake could be tricked into pursuing on foot and abandoning the Batmobile, maybe\u2014\n\u00a0\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I tell Bruce?\u201d Drake said, unsettlingly calm. No, not calm. Focused. Like a cat with a mouse in its clutches. Or a detective with a suspect caught in a lie. \"Give me  one  good reason.\"\nIt wasn't a good reason; it wasn't what Damian would have said if he'd had any control. Rather than biting wit or careful manipulation, what came out was the petulant whine of a  child. \"It wasn't on purpose. I didn't know it was wrong.\"\u00a0\nAn expression of scorn crossed Drake's face before it flattened out into that infuriating, calculating mask again. The phrase that never failed to make both Drake  and  Damian furious.  Damian doesn't know any better. Insufferable and dismissive, whether it came from Dick Grayson or their shared father or anyone else.\n\"Of course.\" Tim spat. \"Sure. You come here plotting to murder me and my brother. Oh, but you're  maladjusted, so it doesn't matter. You actively try murder me multiple times, but that\u2019s  fine, because, what, you were feeling  insecure?\"\nDamian was shaking with what he decided  must  be rage, because he hated Drake, he  despised  him, and opened his mouth to say so\u2014\"I was scared of you. I was certain you'd kill me at the first opportunity,\" he heard his voice say, and the air in the car was so still and quiet that he might have been alone. \"It was the logical conclusion. I was next in line. You had the most to gain from my death. Mother warned me about you. You were the craftiest of Father's children. Your paltry attempts to, to get me alone, to make me trust you, it all seemed an obvious trap. I'd only just gotten here.\" The chemicals and lights and fires behind his eyes cast him cold and lonely and desperate to live. Desperate to carve out a place for himself in this inscrutable new world. \"I'd only just met my father. If I was going to die so soon after my escape, I wanted to die fighting, with a blade in my hand. Not stricken down by a viper I failed to see coming.\"\nDrake's expression cracked down the middle. He did not reach out to make physical contact. In fact, Damian noted, Drake had not so much as crowded him throughout this terrible questioning. His expression righted itself into something that wasn't quite angry, wasn't quite sad. At least, Damian thought desperately,\u00a0 it was no longer smug.\n\"Damian\u2026\" Drake began, voice faintly strained, \"I really think Bruce needs to know about this.\"\nAt this last betrayal, following the parade of humiliations, something inside of Damian  snapped.\n \"NO!\"  he shouted. \u201cI will not allow you to\u2014I refuse\u2014You\u2019re just trying to get rid of me and I  will not let you. You  never  liked me. You want me sent away so that you can have all of them to yourself.\u201d his voice was rising steadily in both pitch and volume completely outside of his control. Damian didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou,\u201d he seethed, \u201cwould use outdated intel, either through blackmail or  tattling, to send me back to the League, because you want me gone but you are too much of a coward to kill me  yourself.\u201d\u00a0\nDamian blinked sweat out of his eyes, face red, hands trembling, and took in the painfully familiar expression on Drake\u2019s face. It was exactly the way those so-called educators looked at Damian when he acted too strangely, or said the wrong thing. It was the look they gave him when tactfully suggesting he might benefit from being placed in a more  specialized  class. Seeing that stiff, patronizing pity on the face of Red Robin lit Damian\u2019s veins on fire.\u00a0\n\u201cSTOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!\u201d he screamed. \u201dThere\u2019s\u2014\u201dThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my head, he couldn\u2019t say. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not a child. \u201cI\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t care what you think of me. He couldn\u2019t get the words out. Sick and stressed, Damian floundered, \u201cI do not find myself challenged by my current educational coursework,\u201d he finished lamely. \u201cI\u2019m not...stupid.\u201d\u00a0 Then, humiliatingly, he sniffled.\nDamian waited for Drake to start in, to lord this pathetic little display over him. But the seconds ticked by into steady silence. Why hadn\u2019t he said something? Anything? Damian cracked his eyelids to see him standing there, loose-limbed and as not-angry with Damian as he\u2019d ever been.\n\u00a0When their eyes met, he cocked his head at Damian in a way that was  almost  friendly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. You tired?\u201d\u00a0\nNot trusting his words to obey him, Damian nodded, and found he  was.\n\u201cMe too. Wanna go home?\u201d\nDamian nodded again, closing his eyes. \u201cI would rather die than go back to the league.\" The admission slipped out before he could bite his tongue.\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll go to the manor. It\u2019s closer anyway.\u201d Drake moved back to the front seat and restarted the ignition. He tossed a package of fruit snacks from the glovebox into the backseat, and they landed in Damian\u2019s lap. He cradled the treat with both hands, but did not eat. He was almost home. The miserable interrogation was over. Whatever retribution he faced for running off, whatever Drake decided to do with the information he\u2019d gained, none of it was as important as getting home, escaping to a distant dusty corner of the tower, and waiting for this  whatever it was  to get out of his system.\nEverything else could come later.\nBut of course Drake, with his damnable inability to read a room, had apparently decided that Damian must  be in a mood for opening up. \"Something I\u2019ve been wondering...Why are you so scared of the League? I thought Ra\u2019s was your grandfather. You're his chosen heir, right?\" He tossed the carefully inoffensive question over his shoulder as he shifted gears.\u00a0\n\u201cGrandfather is not looking for a successor in the usual sense.\u201d\u2014and that should have been enough, but the images weren\u2019t  stopping. It wasn't something he wanted to even  think  about, let alone tell  Drake. Damian bit into his lips in an effort to keep them closed, blood dribbling down his chin, eyes squeezed shut, body trembling with the force of  no, no, no  \u2014And Drake, damn him, made a wordless, inquisitive sound, and Damian couldn't stop the words. \"He wants to  shell  me, crack me open and scrape me out and crawl inside and live in my skin, like a worm, like a parasite, and I don't know if I will be dead when he does it or if I will be forced to watch him pilot my living corpse through every single desecration, I don't want to say it, I don't want to say it I don't want to say it  STOP MAKING ME SAY IT \u2014\" Damian latched onto his bare forearm with his teeth as a macabre makeshift gag, hoping to ride out the nauseating horrors dancing behind his eyes.\nDrake threw the car back into park and dove into the backseat, shouting his name. Tugging his arm from his mouth, telling him to breathe, checking his pulse and shining a small light in his eyes and all the while Damian just  shook, unable to even hear the secrets he was blabbering.\nWhen his breathing evened out, Drake swam into focus, looking at Damian with that keen inquisitive gaze that never failed to set his teeth on edge.\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize these symptoms at all,\u201d Tim began, \"but you've definitely been hit with something.\" It wasn\u2019t a question, so Damian didn\u2019t have to answer. Then, with a sick sort of understanding, Drake said, \"Robin. Report?\"\n\"Code Tango-Six-Seven-One. I am unable to lie and forced to answer when prompted.\u201d Damian answered miserably. Helplessly. \u201cIt happened at the docks after I fell. I did not recognize the individual, nor did I see their face.\u201d\nTim paled and swung himself into the front seat, gunning it towards the cave at top speed. Damian was grateful; he didn't want to see Drake\u2019s expression. He listened and felt the rumble of the engine beneath him, and waited for the first  real  question. For the actual interrogation to begin.\u00a0\nThe one he got surprised him.\n\"Fuck, Damian. Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\n\u201cI do not trust you.\u201d Damian said, hollow. \u201cI believed you would use it against me.\u201d He slumped in the backseat, pressing his cheek against the cool window.\u00a0\nThe rest of the trip back to the cave was blessedly silent.\u00a0\nThe Batmobile eventually rumbled to a stop, but Damian didn't move. All he wanted to do was sleep, and the prospect of walking to his room, or even crawling out of the vehicle, suddenly felt too monumentous a task to even contemplate. The cluster of  something  was still roiling and sparking between his ears, making his head throb and his stomach churn.\nThe door he was propped up against was thrown open, but he was too sluggish to process it until he was already tipping backwards\u2014\n\u2014Directly into a pair of warm, waiting arms. He hadn't realized how cold he'd been until he was scooped up and held firmly to a body that felt like a furnace in comparison to his own. He noticed\u00a0 belatedly that he was shivering.\n\"\u2014mian. Damian. Whether or not you can hear me would be a good thing to know right now\u2014\" Damian wiggled his nose in annoyance and the chatter trailed off with a sigh.\nHe felt himself being carried through the cave and laid down on a cot. Warm hands removed his cape, gloves, boots,\u00a0 and armor (without  permission) and a cool, wet cloth was laid across his eyes.\nDrake crossed the room, fiddling with something tiny and metal, based on the noises he made. Damian strained to hear more clearly--\nThe pounding behind his eyes and roilling in his stomach reached an abrupt and alarming zenith.\nThe cloth was dislodged as he rolled half off the cot, convinced he was about to lose his dinner. Drake noticed him with a shout and ran to his side just as Damian rasped, \"I'm not sure Father likes me very much because I'm not adopted,\" and was so thoroughly horrified with himself that he might have gone ahead and thrown up anyway. Except.\nWith the confession, the buzz-thrum eased its vice-like grip slightly, and a new kind of horror struck him.\u00a0\n\"It wants you talking,\" Drake verbalized.\n\"I cannot control what I confess,\" Damian whispered. \"I do not want to...I do not like this. This isn't fair.\"\nDrake responded, \"I don't think Bruce really sees me as family.\"\nDamian snapped his head around to stare. \"What? I don't understand.\"\nDrake met his gaze evenly. \"You're right. This isn't fair. I'm trying to make it fair.\" With that, he retrieved the items he had discarded and, with Damian's permission, took a blood sample. \"I'm going to go test this.\"\nDamian would have preferred to just die in peace, honestly, but Drake continued his damnable chatter as he prepared and began the various tests.\u00a0\n\"You become unwell if you resist,\" he said thoughtfully, \"and if you can't control it...but I might be able to.\" He snapped his fingers with a grin. \"Robin, I respectfully request your permission to ask you some questions.\"\nAny glaring he might have done was hindered by the fact that he couldn't lift his head enough to actually look up. As it was, the nausea was already sweeping back. \"Watch yourself,\" he growled.\nDrake was already trotting across the cave. \"Damian, how many pets do you have?\"\nDamian answered truthfully, but the bubbling in his stomach did not recede even as much as it had moments before. He shook his head miserably.\u00a0\nNevertheless, Drake continued to pry, asking innocuous questions as he drew a second blood sample, as his earlier tests around the room began to ping negatives.\u00a0\nDamian answered everything, obediently and truthfully, but it was not helping. If anything, his condition was steadily worsening, a theory confirmed by the nervous glances Drake kept sending the medical monitor behind his head.\nIt happened again when Drake took a break to tend to the still-weeping teeth marks in Damian's arm; that strange, diseased  something  inside of him reached a boiling point and the words bubbled out of him without his consent. \"I envy you. Father treats you like an equal. It feels like he will never see me as anything but a troublesome child to be dealt with, a nuisance to be  handled.\" The fuzzing around his eyes eased substantially more than last time, but did nothing to help against the hot swell of humiliation.\n\"You know, I envy you, too. Bruce treats you like a son.\" Tim rejoined, tone level, not pausing in his task. Not looking at Damian. \"Sometimes, it feels like he doesn't see me as one of his real kids. Or if I am, I'm the easy one. I'm the one he doesn't have to worry about.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt feels selfish to resent it.\"\n\"He respects you! He trusts you!\" Damian hissed, furious. \"I'd give anything for that!\"\n\"He loves you. He worries about you.\" Tim said, voice oddly thick.\u00a0\nAnd then his head snapped up, and those eyes were  boring  into Damian again.\n\"That\u2019s strange.\u201dHe said slowly. \u201cWhy are so many of your truths about me?\" He abandoned Damian's arm and went over to check on test results, shaking his head. \"You said something strange too, earlier. the wording. You, under a truth spell, said  confess. Why? Does it have to be something I don't know? Or\u2014\" Tim, who had been a flurry of nervous, efficient motion since they had arrived, suddenly stood stock still. \"Secrets. It wants your secrets.\" His expression curdled along with Damian\u2019s stomach. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill Gotham havoc. It was intended for an interrogation.\u201d The flash of stark fury was already gone from his face, so fast Damian couldn't be sure if it had been there at all. Tim was back in detective mode. \"Now, if this is specifically about secrets. Does the level of secrecy affect you? Or maybe the scope\u2014\"\n\"I believe so,\" Damian muttered, dizzy.\n\"We're lucky. Because Damian, you know some pretty big secrets.\" Tim looked at him and, bafflingly, grinned. \"What is Batman's real name?\"\n\"Bruce Wayne,\" Damian rasped, and everything  stopped.\u00a0\nHe sat up in his cot. He took a deep breath and it didn't hurt. His head was clear. \"Theory confirmed,\" he said wonderingly to Tim, who whooped, and inexplicably swept Damian into a quick but desperate hug that barely lasted a second.\u00a0\nThe feeling came creeping back soon enough, but it was simple enough to simply run through the extended league roster, starting from the top and meandering all the way down to vigilantes in other universes.\u00a0\nThey couldn\u2019t keep this up forever, though. They were both exhausted,and the time between questions was getting closer to seconds than minutes. None of the tests seemed to reveal anything. Tim had resorted to hanging any number and combination of magical medallions around Damian\u2019s neck, hoping it was some sort of spell.\n\"It\u2019s definitely not chemical. I'm running tests,\"\u2014Damian's breath hitched minutely\u2014\"What's the dumbest thing you've ever seen Jason do?\"\nThe memory lit up the insides of his eyelids, and Damian answered, \"I saw him cook a grilled cheese sandwich using the roof of a hot car. He ate the end result and became quite ill.\"\n\"Seriously? That guy, I swear. Comes back from the dead  once  and thinks he's invincible.\" Despite his light tone, Tim was visibly stressed, pacing from one failed result to another. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in your blood. No sign of magic at all. Just stress. Stress in your brain from nowhere that'll give you an aneurysm if we let it build up for too long.\u201d\u00a0\nDamian shivered. Tim was resolutely not looking at him.\n\u201cI want to go over your symptoms again. I know that you need to keep telling truths, it's best when prompted, and it's getting worse. If there is anything else, knowing about it might be helpful.\"\nWhen not  helping, Tim had avoided asking questions altogether, which Damian had appreciated and unfortunately been forced to admit. Drake had simply given him a soft little smile and informed Damian that he was allergic to eggs.\nBecause of this, Damian was able to pick his words carefully. \"When you ask me something, it's as if...every associated memory is immediately brought to the forefront of my mind. No matter what I am trying to say, what I say is a brief summary of the amalgamation. This set in as my condition progressed.\"\nTim plopped down on the cot beside him with a defeated stillness. \u201cHow old is Wonder Woman?\u201d He said, hands pressed against his eyes.\n\u201cShe does not remember, so her exact age has been lost to time. Several thousands, undoubtedly.\u201d\n\u201cShit, sorry. Where does Krypto live?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Kent Farm in Smallville, Kansas.\u201d Damian stared at his hands. \u201cI do not want to die.\u201d\n\u201cDamian, I\u2019m...I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d Tim flopped onto his back, nearly dislodging him from the cot. \u201cIf it's not chemical...if it\u2019s not magic...forced memory recall\u2026\u201d He ground the heel of his hands into his eyes, muttering like a madman under his breath.\u00a0\nDamian let out the breath he was holding when Drake rocketed up into a sitting position. \u201cPsychic. Fuck, that has to be it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow do you cure a psychic disease?\u201d Damian asked, frantic despite himself. \u201cHow do you prevent a psychic aneurysm?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t\u2026''Tim glanced up, spotted his quivering hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s the real reason Starfire hates human clothing?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to most synthetic fabrics.\u201d Damain wheezed as the pain receded; the thin mattress they shared was jostled as Tim leapt to his feet with a shout.\nThe sound of running feet caught his attention before his vision cleared enough to see Tim already returning from the other side of the cave, a wave of black fabric billowing behind him.\nHe jammed  the  cowl, Father's cowl, onto Damian's head. It absolutely swallowed him, pooling onto the floor around him and slipping down to cover his eyes. When he adjusted the mask to peer through the eyeholes, he found Drake crouching before him, fists knotted in the thick, dark fabric.\u00a0\n\"He configured it to scramble psychic interference after a run-in with the Mad Hatter.\" Tim breathed. \"Try it, Damian. Say something.\"\nDamian looked down the long, batlike nose of the law at Tim Drake. \"I,\" he said, \"have never been anything but perfectly nice to you.\"\nDrake laughed. He laughed so hard, amused and relieved, that he tipped backwards and sat upon the ground with his hands behind him, grinning sunnily up at Damian. And sitting there, swamped in his father's cape, Damian found himself grinning back.\nAnd it hit him in a rush. \"I remember. I remember who did it,\u201d he said, leaping down from the cot.\u00a0\nTim\u2019s smile changed into something a fraction more fearsome. \u201cLet\u2019s call it in.\u201d\nSeveral rooftops away from the rendezvous point, evidence safely retrieved, Batman took a moment to breathe in the crisp night air.\nHis comm fizzled to life in his ear.  \u201cRed Robin speaking. Come in, Batman. Come in, Nightwing.\u201d \nBruce tapped his earpiece. \u201cBatman speaking.\u201d Nightwing mirrored the gesture one roof over. \u201cReport.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got a mission for you. Priority Alpha-Nine-Five. Psychic attack. I\u2019ve got everything stabilized, but we need to put a stop to it now rather than later.\u201d \u00a0\nThere was a delicate barely-there thump as Nightwing joined him on the roof.\nBatman nodded to his partner. \u201cUnderstood. How is he?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine, Batman,\u201d  Damian\u2019s voice piped up over the secure channel.  \u201cThe suspect is a woman with glowing skin. Her accent was one I did not recognize, but can re-create.\u201d\u00a0 He cleared his little throat. \u201cGah-thum Siddy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWisconsin,\u201d Batman, as a general rule, didn\u2019t laugh or smile much while in costume. That sort of thing gave people the wrong idea. Nightwing had no such qualms, and had muted his comm to  wheeze, bent in half and clutching his sides. \u201cThat sounds like Wisconsin. Good work, Robin.\u201d Batman did not laugh, because he was a professional.\n \u201cHe also did a sketch,\u201d  Tim again,  \u201cand it\u2019s pretty concise. I\u2019m running it through a few databases right now, but I can send a copy to you guys, see if you recognize it.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ve sent it to the BartPhone\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBatcell,\u201d Bruce corrected.\nDick rolled his eyes, \u201cLike that\u2019s any less silly\u2014\u201d\n\n \u201c\u2014okay, the photo will hit your funny pocket computer any second now, unless you\u2019re in the sewer or something.\u201d \n\nThere was a faint sound over the line that might have been Damian snickering, if Damian were the sort of child to let himself be heard laughing.\n\n \u201cIn the meantime, Nightwing, you\u2019ll need a cowl with psychic disrupters. You can hit up my place for the Red Robin cowl.\u201d \n\nBatman and Nightwing glance at each other, in sync as always. \u201cThere\u2019s a spare cowl in the cave, right?\u201d Nightwing said slowly. \u201cIs there something wrong with that one?\u201d\nThere was a pregnant pause.\n\u201cRed Robin,\u201d Nightwing said gleefully, \u201cHow did you neutralize the psychic attack?\u201d\n\n \u201c...I think you know how.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust tell me one thing.\u201d Nightwing said gravely. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d The furious shout of a child betrayed rattled through the comms, answered only by bright cackling.\nThe  Batcell  pinged, saving them all from the unfolding conversation. Bruce studied the photograph closely. It was a woman, drawn lightly in pencil, with sharp cheeks and a heavy brow. Batman murmured, \u201cI think...No, I know who this is. Tina Sanders, formerly known as Christina Bertinelli. She got ousted from the family for reasons unknown.\u201d Batman caught Nightwing\u2019s incredulous gaze. \u201cArrow warned me she might be looking to get a foothold in the Gotham scene.\u201d\n\n \u201cWell, those reasons might have just gotten a little bit more known. She\u2019s a contact telepath with a penchant for messing with people\u2019s heads; she\u2019s been putting her fingers in peoples brains and wiggling them until information comes out or until their brains liquify. The cowl is enough to shield and disrupt it, but she\u2019s still got an extra-sensory grip on Robin.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find her and cut him free,\u201d Nightwing said with an even, furious certainty, all humor gone from his face. Batman was already tuning in to Oracle\u2019s channel, relaying what they knew. This would not take long.\n\u201cThank you, Red Robin. Good work tonight. We\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d Batman hesitated. \u201cThank you for taking care of each other. Thank you for trusting each other.\u201d\n \u201cStay safe,\u201d  came Tim\u2019s slightly choked response, and the transmission ended.\nIt wasn\u2019t fifteen seconds before a new voice, sharper and impossibly clear, filled the airwaves. \u201cOracle here. Heard something about a couple of birds in trouble?\u201d \n\u201cRight here, Ma\u2019am,\u201d Nightwing responded. \u201cGot anything for us?\u201d\n \u201cBoy, do I,\u201d Came the answer.\nBatman fixed the image of Christina Bertinelli\u2019s face in his mind and readied his grappling hook. \"Just tell me where I need to go.\"\n\n \u201cHead toward Seventh and Conway. I\u2019ll fill you in as you fly.\u201d \n\nTim sat in front of the Batcomputer, dizzy with...any number of things. Relief, exhaustion, emotion. His tiny companion paced around the area with leagues of fabric dragging along behind him. They hadn\u2019t really spoken since the cowl had gone on, and hadn\u2019t even looked at each other since the call had ended.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wipe the audio.\u201d\nThe Batman mask floating four feet off the ground spun to face him with an eventful  swoosh. Demanding answers without asking for them.\n\u201cThe recordings in the car, and the audio in here, too.\u201d Tim sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it before they get back. Before they find out what it did to you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Damian said cautiously, creeping closer to take a seat near Tim. As if to watch him. As if this, too, might be some sort of trick to get the better of him.\nAnd Tim couldn't stop himself. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d\nDamian shifted in his seat. \u201cI know that Father does not permit killing.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cDamian. If you didn\u2019t know before, I\u2019m telling you now. I would not jeopardize your safety in the field or in your personal life for petty or selfish reasons. And,\u201d Tim closed his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I did in the car. If I had known, I would never have...I thought you were messing with me. And I was already pissed because of Bruce, and I took that out on you and missed the signs that something was wrong. I was unprofessional, and I was mean. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nSilence. Then, \u201cI am sorry for trying to kill you.\u201d Damian said into the folds of his cape. \u201cThank you for helping me today.\u201d\nTim nodded, thinking that was it. He did as he\u2019d promised, tiptoeing through the system and scrubbing the files of Damian\u2019s secrets.\u00a0\n\u201c...I do not think I am very good at having a family.\u201d Damian said in the smallest voice Tim had ever heard from him, \u201cI lack experience. I worry that I will not be able to catch up.\u201d He squirmed, adjusting the cowl where it tried to slip down again.\n\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m not so good at it either.\u201d Tim swept his gaze over the little guy, considering.\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d\nDamian nodded.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Tim got up and started toward the kitchenette. \u201cHow do you feel about grilled cheese?\u201d he called over his shoulder.\nThat actually surprised a laugh out of Damian. Tim counted it as a victory.\nThey weren\u2019t going to automatically click the way they both had with Dick. That wasn\u2019t how the two of them worked, but that didn\u2019t mean it was impossible. Maybe this \u2018brother\u2019 thing was the sort of thing that took both of them trying  to get it right.\nThe smallest Batman rumpled over to join him, peering at the ingredients Tim had amassed on the counter.\u00a0 \u201cNow, I\u2019ve never done this before, but it\u2019s not like we can do worse than Jason.\u201d Tim smiled down at Damian. Trying.\n\"A statistical improbability,\u201d Damian agreed and, trying, allowed the corner of his mouth to twitch upward in response.\nBatman and Nightwing rolled into the cave at a crisp 5:51am, wayward telepaths neutralized and locked away.\u00a0\nPsychic truth serum. Dick shook his head.  Only in Gotham. \nTina, it seems, hadn\u2019t been able to convince anyone at all to work with her or even associate with her. So she had decided to build a name for herself by cracking heads open for sensitive intel, following the poor saps around as they spilled their guts, and then abandoning them on random street corners to die.\nDick could have told her she\u2019d never find business in a place like Gotham. Gotham had secrets running through her  veins.\u00a0No one wanted to work with someone who would jeopardize her delicate balance.\n\u201cTim? Damian?\u201d He called hoarsely. No response. Stepping over to the kitchenette for some tea, he discovered why.\nOn an adjacent couch, with burned bits of sandwich crust and empty fruit snack packages littered around them like a halo, were the men of the hour. Tim was snuggled against the arm of the couch with his knees drawn up, and Damian was curled up against his side, still wearing the comically too-big cowl.\u00a0\nAbsolutely dead asleep, the both of them."
