    "text": "\n \u201cI know ya said one time, but since you let me pick something, dontcha think it\u2019s only fair for me to do something you wanna do, too?\u201d \n\nThe words have been swirling around in Kiyoomi\u2019s head since Atsumu closed the door to his apartment. They continue to resonate as he relieves the pressure between his legs, the heat that built and built in him throughout the scene. Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t always get off after a session; that often isn\u2019t the point, nor the primary source of the satisfaction he gets from domming.\u00a0\nAlthough it\u2019s not  rare  for him to be sexually gratified, Kiyoomi still finds himself clinging to a sense of furtive shame over the fact that he\u2019s masturbating to  Miya Atsumu, all but glaring at his dick as he strokes himself. The embarrassment slips through his fingers like water, washed away by memories of hollowed-out noises and straining muscles and the way Atsumu\u2019s body looked when he finally went limp, giving into Kiyoomi completely-\n \u201cShit,\u201d  Kiyoomi curses as he spills, so harsh and sudden that he nearly misses catching his release in a tissue. He bites his lip and groans through it, plagued by completely unwanted images of Atsumu\u2019s face when he came the third time.\u00a0\nFuck.  Fuck. \nHe pushes the thoughts away desperately as he showers and gets ready for bed.  Sleep on it, he tells himself.\u00a0\nKiyoomi manages not to make any solid plans, but he can\u2019t help but begin to run through lists in his head. He can\u2019t help but begin to imagine what he\u2019d do to Atsumu if he took him up on his disgustingly tempting offer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe thing is, Atsumu wasn\u2019t just fucking with Sakusa when he offered to owe him one. At first he meant it mostly as a flirt. He was pretty sure that Sakusa had a good time. He said Atsumu did a good job. Atsumu definitely peeped a boner at one point during the scene.\u00a0\nSo that was motivation number one.\u00a0\nOn top of that, the idea of Sakusa choosing something added a delicious extra layer to the whole power dynamic and Atsumu was  interested  in that. It was a no-brainer to offer a repeat performance. He\u2019ll just have to wait and see if Sakusa will take the bait.\nHe gets a text from Sakusa the next morning. It embarrassingly sends a bolt of heat straight from his stomach down to his dick when he sees the name flash across his cell phone screen.\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Are you feeling alright this morning?\u00a0\nAtsumu smirks.\nTo:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Feeling good~&gt;&gt; (\u30ce\uffe3\u03c9\uffe3)\u30ce\nHe waits for the next message with bated breath when he sees the typing indicator at the end of their text chain.\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Good. Make sure to drink extra water. See you at practice.\nAtsumu frowns. Well, that\u2019s not fun and flirty. He goes for the direct approach, considering that\u2019s much more Sakusa\u2019s style.\u00a0\nTo:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Any thoughts on my offer, Omi-kuuuuuuuun?~\nThere\u2019s no immediate response, and there\u2019s not a delayed one either. The rest of the day goes by as normal. He doesn\u2019t get too down about it since he has dinner with his Ma and Osamu, and family is more than enough to distract him from the tender feeling in his wrists.\u00a0\nHowever, Atsumu\u2019s optimism wavers over the next few days of practice. Sakusa doesn\u2019t act any different than normal and he doesn\u2019t acknowledge Atsumu\u2019s offer of a second rodeo. Maybe he didn\u2019t understand that Atsumu was serious? He fucks with the other man enough that he supposes it could be interpreted that way.\nTo be sure, Atsumu grabs a spot next to Sakusa on the team bus at the next opportunity. The spiker stores his backpack under the seat and adjusts his mask as the bus gets rolling.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Omi-kun.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cYa\u2019know,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI really liked the-\u201d he lowers his voice to a sub-whisper- \u201coverstim, but I\u2019d obviously be interested in tryin\u2019 other stuff, so t\u2019be clear I was serious\u2014\u2018bout my offer.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s leaning over in his seat to look at Kiyoomi\u2019s face, trying to read his half hidden expression. It\u2019s pretty much impossible.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sakusa says, with just a single quick sideways glance.\u00a0\nThen he wedges his neck pillow into place, crosses his arms over his chest, and closes his eyes.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s jaw drops a little.  God, this guy pisses him off. In a huff, Atsumu pushes himself out of the seat and stomps towards the back of the bus where Bokuto and Hinata have set up shop.\nThe irritation carries Atsumu through the drive and through the game, but it loses its heat when he\u2019s laying in a hotel bed wondering how Akaashi hasn\u2019t murdered Bokuto for his snoring. He begins to wonder, what if it hadn\u2019t been as good for Sakusa as it had been for Atsumu? What if it hadn\u2019t been that great for Sakusa at all? The thought makes a sticky, hot sort of shame claw up Atsumu\u2019s throat, his skin crawling with embarrassment.\nAtsumu doesn\u2019t have any point of comparison, obviously, but Sakusa is clearly very good at the whole dom thing. He thinks about the leather he\u2019d seen hanging in Sakusa\u2019s bathroom, evidence that Atsumu wasn\u2019t the only one recently in his bed. His personality sucks but he\u2019s objectively attractive; Atsumu will give him that.\u00a0 He probably has perfect, delicate, experienced  subs lined up out the door. He probably doesn\u2019t need Atsumu to throw him a bone or whatever. It had been Atsumu begging him to even get a foot in the door in the first place.\u00a0\nAtsumu groans, partly at the situation but mostly at himself. He grabs a pillow and whips it towards the chainsaw sounds coming from the other bed.\u00a0\n \u201cHurk\u2014!\u201d  the noises stop for a second as Bokuto chokes and then mumbles, \u201cAwghawshii\u2026\u201d\nThe snoring begins again and Atsumu presses the heels of his palms into his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKiyoomi sits in front of his laptop again. It occurred to him the other day that the only reason he was likely entertaining Atsumu\u2019s offer is because he hasn\u2019t found a compatible sub yet in Osaka. Just because he and Atsumu seem to be semi-compatible, in spite of the other man\u2019s inexperience, doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other very good reasons not to pursue a second session with him. Namely, number one, the most important being:  he\u2019s Miya Atsumu.\u00a0 \nSo Kiyoomi goes back to the drawing board, pulling up the original leads from his community members, recommending local subs who might be available in Osaka. He shoots out a few new emails and is surprised to hear back from a man called Hikaru the same night. He sends his checklist over and Kiyoomi discovers that they have plenty of interest overlap.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s actually a little upset he didn\u2019t reach out sooner. Hikaru also includes a bodyshot, and he\u2019s definitely Kiyoomi\u2019s type. Not huge, but strong, with thick thighs and a soft stomach that he thinks would color up nicely under the right circumstances.\u00a0\nKiyoomi resolutely ignores the reason he\u2019s moving much quicker than usual when he sets up a session for just two days later.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,  no, please\u2014\u201d \nHikaru shakes violently when Kiyoomi clicks the vibrator up another notch. He\u2019s got him kneeling at the head of the bed, pillows removed and replaced with a number of clean grey towels\u2014or, well, formerly clean towels. They\u2019re currently splattered with the evidence of the man\u2019s last three climaxes.\u00a0\nHikaru\u2019s thighs quake with the effort of holding himself upright. He\u2019s got a pair of clamps on his nipples, the short chain looped through the top of the headboard, promising excruciating pain if he gives in to his rapidly weakening muscles and sits down. Kiyoomi\u2019s got him in quite the predicament, right where he wants him.\n\u201cSir,  please, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne more,\u201d Kiyoomi says, pressing the vibrator down against the man\u2019s abused prostate, speeding the hand on his dick.\u00a0\nHikaru sobs openly, throwing his head back, shoulders bunching and face wet. He\u2019s really pretty like this, Kiyoomi acknowledges. He\u2019s done well, and the scene is going just as Kiyoomi planned. Hikaru is a great match on paper and yet\u2026\u00a0\nKiyoomi\u2019s just glad the man can\u2019t see his furrowed brow when he realizes that all he can think about is how Atsumu would look with tears running down his cheeks just like this.\u00a0\nSomewhere in the back of his head, Kiyoomi admits utter defeat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s phone buzzes on his coffee table. He can\u2019t be bothered to reach over to look at it. The match yesterday against the Adlers was brutal. Five grueling sets, four of which approached or hit thirty points, only for the Black Jackals to finally go down to a service ace from Kageyama Tobio. That should have been the insult to their injury, but it  wasn\u2019t . What really got stuck in Atsumu\u2019s craw was the fact that that the bastard immediately fucked off with Hinata to do whatever it was they did with their absolutely endless wells of energy while the rest of them asphyxiated on the court. Looking at those two, you\u2019d think they\u2019d just played a three-set practice match. As far as Atsumu is concerned, Hinata can set for himself next practice if he has all that extra energy\u2026 enough energy\u2026 for two people\u2026 he could just...\nEven thinking is too exhausting right now.\u00a0\nAtsumu had muscles he didn\u2019t know  existed cramping after that match. He\u2019s still paying for it today, moaning and intermittently texting Osamu to beg him to bring onigiri. He\u2019s sure the text that\u2019s making his phone buzz is the man himself telling Atsumu to fuck off and stop being such a baby.\u00a0\nHe stares at the TV without moving for a little longer, until his stomach rumbles again. Maybe Osamu is actually in a charitable mood, unlikely as that may be. Atsumu groans as he flops an arm over, having to engage his abused core muscles to reach his phone. He flops back with a dramatic sigh and then unlocks it.\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Are you free on Sunday evening?\u00a0\nAtsumu blinks at his phone stupidly. His fingers move before his brain returns from its spiraling. He shouldn't get ahead of himself, nor get his hopes up. But...\nTo:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; I think so? Why do you ask?\nThe response comes quickly.\nFrom:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; Why do you think.\u00a0\nAtsumu can feel the disdain through the phone. He absolutely doesn\u2019t care. His fingers slam against the screen.\u00a0\nTo:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; I\u2019m definitely free. What are we doing?\u00a0\nFrom:  Omi-Omi&gt;&gt; We\u2019ll discuss when you arrive. I won\u2019t pick anything marked less than \u2018curious about\u2019 on your list. Come by at 7pm.\u00a0\nAtsumu quickly sends a thumbs up, shocked at the way his body is responding to the tone of the texts alone. He sets his phone down on his chest and looks down at the bulge in his sweatpants.\u00a0\n\u201cCould you cool it?\u201d he asks his dick.\u00a0\nHis dick resolutely doesn\u2019t respond.\n\u00a0\nAtsumu sits across from Kiyoomi at his small kitchen table. He\u2019s fidgeting, knee bouncing rapidly under the table as the other man outlines the details of his proposed scene.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, edging, huh?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I particularly enjoy and it seemed\u2026 fitting, considering your first scene,\u201d Kiyoomi smirks.\u00a0\nAtsumu blushes, and Kiyoomi can\u2019t wait to see if he relaxes under the restraints again. Right now he looks like one wrong move would have him bolting like a startled animal, but last time he\u2019d calmed so quickly under Kiyoomi\u2019s careful touch.\u00a0\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d\nKiyoomi takes a drink from his teacup.\u00a0\n\u201cBeyond orgasm delay, I have some ideas about how the scene could evolve. If you\u2019re okay with it, I might dabble in a few of your other checklist items. I like being able to adapt in the middle of a scene, but some people prefer not to go off script. Are you open to adjusting as we go, or do you want me to stick to whatever we agree to before we start?\u201d Kiyoomi asks.\u00a0\nAtsumu swallows hard, running his hand through his hair and chuckling nervously. \u201cM\u2019still not used ta how formal all this lead-in is.\u201d\n\u201cTelevision does a very poor job of representing the community. Safety and consent are the most important tenets of real BDSM.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I did the readings, Omi-kun,\u201d he laughs again. Kiyoomi is pleased to see he seems to be gradually loosening up, even if he\u2019s more of a flippant douche this way. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t think I wanna know details ahead of time. I\u2019d be distracted thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout it. I trust ya, considering how serious you are \u2018bout all this stuff. Plus, you\u2019d stop if I didn\u2019t like something at all, right?\u201d\nKiyoomi is sort of surprised to hear the words  I trust ya  from Atsumu, but supposes he\u2019d have to be even stupider than Kiyoomi thought to let someone he doesn\u2019t trust, at least to an extent, tie him up.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. That\u2019s what the stoplight system is for,\u201d Kiyoomi confirms, holding Atsumu\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWell there ya go,\u201d Atsumu says, leaning back in his chair. Yep, he\u2019s gone full flippant douche again. \u201cDo yer worst, Omi-kun~\u201d\nKiyoomi raises an eyebrow.\u00a0\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for, Miya,\u201d he says as he stands up from the table. Atsumu\u2019s eyes widen just a little, but Kiyoomi notices and smirks behind the mask. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s  excited. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get set up. Feel free to finish your tea, and go take a shower whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the bedroom, Kiyoomi starts by flipping the washable quilt he keeps on his bed over the pillows. He\u2019s not sure if they\u2019ll actually use the bed today, but better safe than sorry. Then he goes to the chair in the corner and moves the potted plant on the seat to the top of his dresser. Kiyoomi sets the chair at the end of the bed, facing the headboard.\nHe goes to the closet and pulls out what he needs for the scene, plus a few extra just-in-case items, and does one last check for cleanliness and functionality. Kiyoomi gently lays out the various cuffs and thin chains on the foot of the bed. Finally, he takes one of his small bedside tables and sets it near the chair, making sure the lube, gloves, and a spare towel are all in reach. Satisfied, Kiyoomi grabs his change of clothes and heads into the bathroom to shower.\u00a0\nWhen he returns to the bedroom, Atsumu is already there, naked except for the towel around his waist. He\u2019s got one of the cuffs in his hands, turning it over in his palms. He turns towards Kiyoomi when he hears the bathroom door close.\u00a0\nHe looks a little like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, was just curious why there\u2019re six cuffs when I only got four limbs,\u201d he says, twirling the cuff around one finger as a small smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth.\nKiyoomi smiles faintly behind his mask as he rolls up the sleeves of his button-up. The bravado Atsumu is displaying is easy to see through, and Kiyoomi is excited to shatter it.\u00a0\n\u201cThe extra two are for your elbows. Once you\u2019re bound to the chair, I don\u2019t want you to be able to lean too far forward,\u201d Kiyoomi explains, taking the cuff from Atsumu\u2019s hands.\nHe immediately takes Atsumu\u2019s arm and slides the cuff around one wrist, holding the other man\u2019s eyes as he tightens it. Not too tight, but tight enough. He sees Atsumu\u2019s throat bob and begins to let his instinct, the persona, take over. There\u2019s a tingle in Kiyoomi\u2019s fingers at the skin on skin contact.\nHe blinks. Gloves. He should put on gloves.\n\u201cFold your towel and place it on the chair, Atsumu, then take a seat,\u201d Kiyoomi says as he pulls on a pair of black nitrile gloves.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t look up to see if Atsumu follows the instructions. Instead, he indulges in the delayed gratification, gathering three more of the cuffs from the bed. When Kiyoomi turns around a moment later, the other man has done exactly as asked. He\u2019s waiting with his hands in his lap, watching Kiyoomi with an open expression. His cock lays against his hip, thick but not yet fully hard.\u00a0\nKiyoomi puts the cuffs on methodically, first on Atsumu\u2019s other wrist, and then one above each of his elbows. He enjoys the way Atsumu lets himself be repositioned, the way he submits to Kiyoomi\u2019s fingers, firm and clinical, moving his arms behind the back of the chair. Kiyoomi takes a longer silver chain and runs it through the d-rings on each of the elbow cuffs. He crosses it to form an x before securing the chains at Atsumu\u2019s wrists. Finally, he attaches the ends of the restraint to the metal supports beneath the seat of the chair, effectively taking Atsumu\u2019s arms and freedom of movement out of play. He should be able to lean forward a few inches, but no more.\u00a0\nWhen Kiyoomi comes back around the chair, Atsumu is fully hard and breathing shallowly, eyes wide.\u00a0\n\u201cAlready this worked up?\u201d Kiyoomi muses, tipping his chin upwards with a knuckle to observe the flush on his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to start with thirty minutes since you\u2019re a beginner, but if you\u2019re already this aroused it\u2019s going to become difficult for you pretty quickly.\u201d\n\u201cThirty minutes of what?\u201d Atsumu bites out.\n\u201cEdging. Stimulation without orgasm.\u201d\n\n \u201cShit.\u201d \n\nKiyoomi grabs the final two cuffs and a pair of folded washcloths. He wraps a cuff loosely around Atsumu\u2019s left ankle and the leg of the chair. He slides one of the washcloths between skin and metal before tightening the cuff, binding Atsumu\u2019s ankle to the outside of the chair leg. He repeats the process on the right side and then sits back to survey his work. The restraints effectively spread Atsumu\u2019s knees apart; when Kiyoomi looks back at his face, he has his eyes squeezed shut, seemingly trying to regulate his breathing.\nKiyoomi wonders how long that will last.\u00a0\nHe slides in front of Atsumu and takes a seat on the edge of the bed. They\u2019re eye level now, Atsumu staring at him like a wild horse that knows it\u2019s about to be broken, a little defiant, a little scared.\u00a0\nIt makes something that feels like molten honey pool in Kiyoomi\u2019s chest. He loves this, he really does.\u00a0\n\u201cDo the bindings feel okay? They should be tight but shouldn\u2019t pinch or cut off any blood flow,\u201d Kiyoomi says, reaching out to gather a couple pumps of lube to warm in his palm.\u00a0\n\u201cTh-they\u2019re fine,\u201d Atsumu says, eyes trained on Kiyoomi\u2019s hand. Kiyoomi rubs his fingers together just to see him squirm a little more.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your color?\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s gaze snaps up to meet Kiyoomi\u2019s.\n\n \u201cGreen.\u201d \n\nKiyoomi smiles behind the mask. \u201cGood, then let\u2019s begin.\u201d\u00a0\nHe glances at the hands of the round, metal alarm clock on the dresser behind Atsumu, noting the time.\u00a0\nKiyoomi starts by getting Atsumu wet all over, sure strokes from root to tip. Atsumu sucks in a deep breath, thighs jumping at the first touches as he gets harder in the firm grip. He really does have a nice cock; Kiyoomi wasn\u2019t lying when he called it pretty during their first scene. It\u2019s proportionate to his body, and thick, with a graceful upward curve to it. It fits in Kiyoomi\u2019s hand well, with more than enough length to work with.\u00a0\nHe spreads the lube around, working up to a steady handjob rhythm, if a bit slow. Atsumu is still dragging air in through his nose and letting it out between pursed lips. His shoulders are tense, legs braced like he\u2019s getting ready to receive an Olympian\u2019s serve. Kiyoomi is going to push him until his own thoughts no longer control his movements, until Atsumu\u2019s body is responding not to his mind but to Kiyoomi\u2019s hands alone.\u00a0\nAtsumu lets out a throaty groan and Kiyoomi slows his pace even further.\u00a0\nHe really does enjoy edging. It\u2019s not that  \u2018hardcore\u2019 compared to other kinks on the surface; people don\u2019t balk at it like they do paddling or rope suspension. But it\u2019s revealing, and unforgiving, and Kiyoomi hasn\u2019t seen anything break a man down more quickly.\u00a0\nKiyoomi keeps it up until Atsumu\u2019s knees begin to cant outwards, then takes his hand away.\n \u201cShit\u2014  the  fuck, Omi\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started. That wasn\u2019t even an edge, I just needed you fully hard.\u201d Kiyoomi looks up to hold Atsumu\u2019s gaze for a moment. His face is red, neck slightly strained by the position of his arms and the way he\u2019s still defiantly arching his back. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re going to tell me if you think you\u2019re about to come.\u201d\nAtsumu grits his teeth, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI know your tells a little from the first scene, but I don\u2019t know your body well enough to be sure you won\u2019t come without warning,\u201d Sakusa explains and reaches back out to loosely tease his length. A muscle in Atsumu\u2019s jaw twitches. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, and come before I give you the ok, I\u2019ll just restart the clock, this time with sixty minutes.\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s hips jump, just a little, and Kiyoomi smirks behind black fabric.\u00a0\nHe rubs a small circle at the base of Atsumu\u2019s cock, brushing the skin of his drawn-up balls on each downstroke.\u00a0\n\n \u201cMmmnnf.\u201d \n\nAtsumu is biting his lip and Kiyoomi reaches up with his clean hand to pull it free, pressing it down against his bottom teeth for just a moment, forcing his mouth open a little. It\u2019s enough he can feel Atsumu\u2019s quickening breath through the nitrile.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you understand, Atsumu?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no response, just a deeply furrowed brow, so Kiyoomi takes his balls between his first two fingers and pulls, squeezing them gently between his knuckles. Atsumu gasps.\n\u201cSh-shit! Yes, Omi,  yes.  I got it\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nAnd then Kiyoomi begins in earnest, fluttering his fingers up Atsumu\u2019s cock before forming a circle with his hand, almost pulsing it up and down over the head. He hears a low groan catch in Atsumu\u2019s throat.\u00a0\nAfter a minute or two, Kiyoomi rakes his eyes up and down Atsumu\u2019s body. He clocks the tightening of his abdominals, the spasms in his thighs and the outside of his glutes. Kiyoomi is going to test something. He grabs the towel between Atsumu\u2019s legs with his free hand and pulls him forward a couple inches with a sharp jerk of his arm. Atsumu gasps again as his ass is pulled closer to the edge of the chair, changing the angle. He\u2019s more exposed this way, his lower back closer to the seat. His dick would lay against his stomach if Kiyoomi let go.\nBut he doesn\u2019t. He wants to see where Atsumu\u2019s head is at.\u00a0\nAn errant thought passes through Kiyoomi\u2019s mind: perhaps what setters get out of volleyball isn\u2019t so different from what Kiyoomi gets out of domming. The idea of having to listen to all his teammates, assess their conditions, observe the opponent, and synthesize all that into strategic execution isn\u2019t something Kiyoomi is interested in. But he can empathize with the rush they must feel when all that information produces results as he tracks the flush crawling further down Atsumu\u2019s chest, recognizes the shift in his breathing, feels the cock in his hand twitch and pulse.\u00a0\nKiyoomi\u2019s eyes narrow as Atsumu\u2019s back begins to arch, head tipping back, toes curling\u2014\nHe releases Atsumu\u2019s dick suddenly, reaching up to press his thumb into his frenulum, his index finger pressing down against the other side. He squeezes, not hard enough to hurt Atsumu, but enough to cut off the orgasm that had definitely just been about to crest. The other man\u2019s body jerks like it\u2019s been shot.\u00a0\nA crushed, strangled sound leaves his lips.\u00a0\nKiyoomi keeps the pressure up, eyes trained on Atsumu\u2019s face, until he collapses back into the chair.\u00a0\n\u201cThat was a favor, Atsumu. What did I say?\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s eyes are squeezed shut and he tucks his chin downward, breathing harshly.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t give him too long, and begins again gently, just his fingertips, trailing up and down his cock. The head is slick, wet with Atsumu\u2019s precome, evidence of how close he\u2019d been; Atsumu\u2019s hips twitch away but Kiyoomi\u2019s fingers follow, relentless.\u00a0\n\u201cHow am I supposed to know your limit if you don\u2019t even know your own?\u201d Kiyoomi continues, leaning forward.\u00a0\nAtsumu sucks in a shaky breath, \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014m\u2019sorry, m\u2019sorry.\u201d\nKiyoomi hushes him and runs his clean hand over his hip, across his taut stomach.\n\u201cShh, I know. You\u2019re learning.\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s never really understood the fascination that some doms have with \u2018training\u2019 new submissives. It\u2019s always seemed like a chore in Kiyoomi\u2019s head, having to explain everything, having to move at a snail\u2019s pace.\u00a0\nHe gets it now. While knowing Atsumu in his daily life was a large reason Kiyoomi  didn\u2019t  want to start this with him, it\u2019s reaping unexpected rewards now: Kiyoomi can track how he slowly cracks open, experiencing and reacting to these things for the very first time. Knowing how Atsumu acts normally means he can see the subtle ways he\u2019s beginning to bloom under Kiyoomi\u2019s directions, under his hands.\u00a0\nKiyoomi resists the urge to adjust himself in his slacks. This isn\u2019t about that.\u00a0\nHe increases the pressure of the hand skating over Atsumu\u2019s torso, drawing his palm over his sternum and back down. He draws a circle with his thumb on Atsumu\u2019s hip as he stops his teasing and wraps his hand around the other man\u2019s length once more. Atsumu grunts and his abs jump underneath his skin.\nKiyoomi keeps it fairly light this time, knowing that Atsumu will be much more sensitive now that he\u2019s almost come once. His dick is bright red and sticks straight up, even when Kiyoomi momentarily lets it go to get more lube.\u00a0\nHe glances up at the clock. It\u2019s only been about seven minutes.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s cock is swollen and so hard that it barely has any give to it. Kiyoomi has always been fascinated by just how obscene  an edged erection can be, the head so smooth and slick. Kiyoomi tightens his hand again, rolling his palm over the tip with a twist of his wrist on each short upstroke.\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Atsumu to begin struggling again, pulling against his bonds, his balls drawing up. He tries to close his legs unsuccessfully, as if he could keep Kiyoomi away. It does get his knees in the way a bit as the cuffs slide up the legs of the chair.\nKiyoomi pushes down on one knee, hard.\n\u201cKeep your legs open,\u201d he snaps.\u00a0\nAtsumu flinches at the words and then his eyes fly open.\u00a0\n\u201cOmi\u2014Omi, Omi, Omi\u2014\u201d \nKiyoomi releases his grip on his cock, understanding the warning. A groan rips from Atsumu\u2019s throat as his hips twitch, looking for the lost stimulation that would have put him over.\u00a0\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s good, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa says, moving his hands to the top of his thighs, both a comforting gesture and making sure he doesn\u2019t fully let up on the arousing touch.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t want Atsumu to go over, but the goal is to keep him close to that tipping point, until his whole body is a livewire.\u00a0\nKiyoomi moves his hands upward, one leaving damp trails and the other dry. When he reaches Atsumu\u2019s chest, he goes straight for his target, running his thumbs around his nipples. As soon as they\u2019ve perked up, he switches to plucking at them lightly. Atsumu\u2019s chest puffs out at first and then he tries to shrink away, his abs rolling.\n\n \u201cFuck-nnggh\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cSensitive?\u201d Kiyoomi asks.\nAtsumu doesn\u2019t respond and so Kiyoomi rubs tight, quick little circles around the buds. He whimpers and Kiyoomi hears the chain clink against the chair as it goes taut.\u00a0\nTwelve minutes have passed, by a quick look at the clock.\u00a0\nHe trails his hands back down Atsumu\u2019s body, one coming to rest on his hip and the other closing around his length again. He rubs his thumb under the head and then strokes softly down to the root, and back up, repeating the motion until Atsumu\u2019s hip is fighting his other hand. It doesn\u2019t take long before Atsumu is chanting Kiyoomi\u2019s name in warning once more.\u00a0\nKiyoomi draws light patterns over his swollen balls, now permanently drawn up tight, as Atsumu sobs at the loss of another imminent release. His toes are curling against the floor as Kiyoomi pets his inner thighs with his free hand.\u00a0\nThe muscles twitch violently. Kiyoomi\u2019s own face is hot as he takes in the way that Atsumu is finally reaching the point where even the softest touches must feel overwhelming.\u00a0\nAtsumu\u2019s head lolls forward and he bites his lip hard, staring down at his dick with shock and a little bit of fear in his eyes. He\u2019s probably never felt like this before\u2014didn\u2019t know he  could feel like this. Kiyoomi takes a deep breath and circles one delicate fingertip around the head, smirk growing as Atsumu grunts and his mouth drops open.\n\u201cAre you seeing yourself?\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs, taking his finger away. A string of precome sticks to the glove, connecting to Atsumu\u2019s dripping cock, before it finally breaks and hangs from Kiyoomi\u2019s fingertip, obscene. \u201cLook at that.\u201d\nAtsumu squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head, thighs hitching like he\u2019s aching to close them.  \u201cOmi\u2026\u201d \nThe next time Kiyoomi brings him to the edge is fast and a little bit mean. He holds Atsumu\u2019s balls in one warm hand as he twists his other up and down the base of his dick, avoiding the weeping tip entirely. A panicked noise falls from Atsumu\u2019s lips.\n \u201cClose\u2026!\u201d  His voice cracks sharply.\u00a0\nAgain, Kiyoomi lets go and moves his hands firmly up Atsumu\u2019s sides to play with his nipples. It\u2019s about time he slicks up his drier hand with lube but something possesses him to run his hand higher, up Atsumu\u2019s neck, to his jaw. His head lolls again as he squirms against the fingers that are still plucking at his chest.\u00a0\nHis eyes flutter open when Kiyoomi touches his face. His brown irises are nearly eclipsed by his blown pupils. They\u2019re wet. He\u2019s not full on crying, but a few tears have squeezed out to saturate his lashes, clumping them together.\u00a0\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs, wiping away the moisture under one eye with his thumb. \u201cWe still have a while yet. Are you done fighting me?\u201d\nAtsumu\u2019s lips part but he looks too overwhelmed to form an answer. Kiyoomi decides to answer his own question as he lowers his hand and slides two gloved fingers between Atsumu\u2019s lips. He pushes them in, gliding firmly over his tongue. Kiyoomi\u2019s breath catches when Atsumu\u2019s eyes roll back and he moans.\u00a0\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t curse but it\u2019s a close thing.\nHe pulls his fingers forward and presses them back in, rubbing over Atsumu\u2019s yielding tongue, the tongue he can\u2019t seem to keep in his mouth the second a camera comes out. For some reason it\u2019s the most lewd thing Kiyoomi\u2019s done today. He expected Atsumu to try and suck on his fingers or something, but no, he just  takes  it, lets Kiyoomi prod and press until a line of drool is dripping down his chin.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s degrading and disgusting and Kiyoomi feels hungry watching him, desperate to do more\u2014as much as Atsumu will let him. He\u2019s a goddamn natural and Kiyoomi wants to find out how much he can take.\nKiyoomi leaves him drooling when he pulls his fingers back out. He brings the wet digits back to Atsumu\u2019s chest and begins to rub over both his nipples quickly. He wonders\u2026\u00a0\nThe other man\u2019s chest rises and falls rapidly under the new onslaught, each breath coming out with a moan. Kiyoomi alternates between the rapid flicking and quick circles, watching closely for the way Atsumu\u2019s lower half begins to twitch and buck.\u00a0\nHe brings one hand down, touching Atsumu\u2019s dick with the back of a single finger, any barely-present friction coming from the other man\u2019s inhibited movements alone. Not five seconds later he\u2019s jerking his hips back, away from the touch.\n\n \u201cOmi\u2014\u201d \n\nHe wonders\u2026\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t stop teasing Atsumu\u2019s nipples, wanting to keep him right on the cusp for a little while, but then Atsumu is crying out again.\u00a0\n\u201cOmi, Omi,  stop, m\u2019gonna\u2014\u201d \nKiyoomi removes his hands from Atsumu\u2019s chest, eyes widening as the thrill of possibility spins in his head.\u00a0\n\u201cOh? You really  are sensitive,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs. \u201cCould you really come from\u2026? No, maybe another time.\u201d\nSixteen minutes have passed.\u00a0\nEnough messing around, Kiyoomi thinks, returning to working Atsumu with both hands. His touches are gentle, often barely there, but Atsumu rockets to the edge four times in as many minutes.\u00a0\n\u201cAbout ten more minutes, Atsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi informs him which incites another sob, as the other man is still reeling from his last denial.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Omi, I  can\u2019t\u2014 I need ta\u2014I\u2019ve gotta\u2014\u201d\nWhen it only takes around twenty seconds for Atsumu to get back to the edge, gasping and crying out when Kiyoomi releases him, he thinks Atsumu might be right. If he was working with someone more experienced, he might let this come to its inevitable failed course: Atsumu either spilling before Kiyoomi gives him permission or safewording out.\u00a0\nThe situation being what it is, however, he doesn\u2019t want to put Atsumu in a situation to feel like he failed, or worse, not feel comfortable enough to admit defeat when he needs to and turn this into a  bad experience.\u00a0\nKiyoomi will have to adjust.\u00a0\nHe lifts Atsumu\u2019s face with a knuckle, while he draws a slow path up and down his stomach with the flat of his other hand. His dick jumps every time Kiyoomi\u2019s hand nears the base. He\u2019s riding the knife's edge. His face looks wrecked, red and a little blotchy, a couple tear tracks and drool shining in the low lighting of the bedroom.\u00a0\n\u201cAtsumu, tell me how you feel.\u201d\nHis brow furrows and his eyes don\u2019t open.\n\u201cHurts\u2026 need t\u2019come,\u201d he slurs.\u00a0\n\u201cYou were supposed to give me thirty minutes, but it\u2019s only been twenty, Atsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi points out.\u00a0\nThe other man tries to curl in on himself, shuddering out a broken sound. Kiyoomi gently runs his hands all over his chest, his thighs, but stays clear of his dick.\u00a0\n\u201cShh,\u201d Kiyoomi soothes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a deal? I\u2019ll let you come now, but you\u2019ll have to pay me back for the ten minutes you couldn\u2019t hold out.\u201d His hands move closer to where Atsumu is hot and dripping, his cock nearly purple in places. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d\nAtsumu quakes under Kiyoomi\u2019s touch, and he doesn\u2019t hesitate.\n \u201cYes, yes\u2014anything,  please, Omi,  please\u2026 \u201d\nKiyoomi reaches out to collect a few pumps of lube into his hand again. He feels a little bad, like a crossroads demon making a deal with the dumbest man alive. Oh well\u2026\u00a0\nWith that Kiyoomi wraps his slick hand around Atsumu and begins to stroke him in earnest, earning himself an immediate jolt and a long, low moan. This might be one of Kiyoomi\u2019s favorite parts of edging: driving someone towards a climax they\u2019ve been trying to avoid for so long that they\u2019re almost scared of their own pleasure.\u00a0\nThe sounds pour continuously from Atsumu\u2019s lips now, each exhale bringing a whimper or groan. Kiyoomi has to press a hand down on his hip to reduce his squirming to a point where he can keep hold of his dick.\u00a0\n \u201cAh-ah-ah-Omi, I\u2014\u201d  Atsumu cries out, voice shattering.\nKiyoomi shortens his stroke and focuses around the head, speeding up, relentless.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Atsumu. Let go,\u201d Kiyoomi purrs.\u00a0\nThen there\u2019s the moment where Atsumu freezes, scrabbling at the edge, before tipping over. His whole body jerks violently and he throws his head back as his dick gets even harder in Kiyoomi\u2019s moving palm.\n \u201cOmi!\u201d  Atsumu nearly shouts.\u00a0\nThe first pulse is a hot dribble, and then his cock kicks in Kiyoomi\u2019s hands and a string of come makes it all the way to Atsumu\u2019s collarbone as he cries out brokenly. This is the beauty of edging; the denial isn\u2019t for nothing, the build is worth it. Kiyoomi keeps stroking, keeps the pressure up as Atsumu comes and comes. It drips down his chest, into his navel, over his hip, over Kiyoomi\u2019s fingers.\u00a0\nHe keeps milking Atsumu until he starts to go soft and his moans shift to whimpers, his hips twitching away from Kiyoomi\u2019s touch.\u00a0\nWhen he releases him, Atsumu collapses completely, like a puppet with its strings cut. Kiyoomi\u2019s tempted to sit there and drink in the sight for a moment, but his work here isn\u2019t finished. He stands, pulling off his ruined gloves with a snap. The sound prompts Atsumu to crack his hazy eyes open. He looks up at Kiyoomi, who raises a brow.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable, Atsumu. We\u2019re not done here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nAtsumu has never come so hard in his entire life, no question, without a doubt. It\u2019s like Sakusa pulled something out of him that he hadn\u2019t known existed, and it radiated out to the very tips of his fingers and the very ends of his toes. And it went \n\non \n\nand \n\non \n\n, a momentary forever.\u00a0\n\n\nHe hears Sakusa\u2019s words, but he doesn\u2019t really register them until his ankles are uncuffed and Sakusa is doing something to his arms behind the chair. He's still feeling a little dazed when Sakusa speaks into his ear.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cStand up, Atsumu.\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s back in the zone where it feels good to comply, feels good to say yes. So, with Sakusa\u2019s help, he stands up on jelly legs and lets himself be maneuvered into a kneeling position near the end of the bed. His arms are now folded loosely into the small of his back, Sakusa having clipped the cuffs together to hold them there. Atsumu is facing the side of the bed and has no idea what this is setting up for, but decides not to question it.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead he just sinks back onto his heels and lets his head drop toward his chest until the next direction comes. His body still feels raw and sensitive, in need of oxygen, almost-aftershocks still making his muscles twitch at random.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Sakusa takes a seat in front of him on the bed, perpendicular to Atsumu, and lays a towel over his lap, he\u2019s finally confused enough to start paying attention.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLay down,\u201d Sakusa instructs and Atsumu blinks in confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pay me back for letting you come so early. That was our deal.\u201d\n\n\nThe only place to lay down from his position would be over Sakusa\u2019s lap... his ass would be\u2014\n\noh \n\n. Atsumu\u2019s breath catches in his throat and his hazy eyes widen. Embarrassingly, his dick gives a feeble twitch.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m asking, Atsumu?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Atsumu rasps, and leans forward to do as Sakusa asked. It\u2019s difficult with his hands bound, but Sakusa guides him until his chest is resting on the bed, his hips pressed into one of the other man\u2019s thighs.\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa is going to hit him. Atsumu always knew it would come one day but, when they ended up on the Black Jackals together, he certainly didn\u2019t think it would happen like \n\nthis.\n\n\n\nHe stares at the far wall through hooded eyes and breathes deep when he feels dry gloves against his skin, first just touching and then lightly kneading.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take ten. One for each minute you couldn\u2019t hold out,\u201d Sakusa explains. \u201cDo you understand, Atsumu?\u201d\n\n\nHe can feel the stitching of Sakusa\u2019s blanket against his cheek, the texture of the towel against his thighs, the heat of Sakusa\u2019s body\u2014\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he breaths.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cColor?\u201d Sakusa follows, squeezing Atsumu a little harder, bringing a flush to the surface of his skin, making him more sensitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cGreen,\u201d \n\nthe word comes out on its own, instinctual and true.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\nAnd without preamble, Sakusa spanks him, right across his left asscheek. Atsumu wasn\u2019t ready and, even though it wasn\u2019t that hard, he jolts and gasps. Sakusa\u2019s palm brushes over the point of impact, but he doesn\u2019t give Atsumu more than a second before he swings again, this time coming down on the right.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s harder, and leaves a stinging sensation behind that makes Atsumu\u2019s body squirm.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCan you take more, Atsumu?\u201d\n\n\nThe sting has already faded into a simple warmth. He wants more, wants to feel it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d \n\nhe whispers. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe feels Sakusa\u2019s hand twitch against his skin; any more observations are shocked out of his head when that palm connects again. It comes down \n\nhard \n\nthis time, enough to drive a startled sound from Atsumu\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\n\nA little voice in his head reminds Atsumu that this can\u2019t even be close to a full power swing from Sakusa. In his mind\u2019s eye he sees a volleyball rocketing to earth, compressed against the court, launched by the force of a national team calibre spiker. Atsumu\u2019s skin feels tight and he shudders at the image.\u00a0\n\n\nHe might die.\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa hits him again, twice in succession, each a little harder than the last. Even knowing they\u2019re coming, Atsumu\u2019s body jerks at each impact. He\u2019s breathing through his open mouth, the quilt getting damp against his cheek. It hurts, it \n\nhurts\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s five, Atsumu. Five to go.\u201d\n\n\nAtsumu moans. His ass is already radiating heat, but fuck if it isn\u2019t getting all mixed up in his head again, the pleasure and the pain.\u00a0\n\n\nHis hips buck hard after the next strike, this one lower than the others, right in the crease between his ass and thigh. It\u2019s \n\npainful.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNnnh!\u201d \n\nhe gasps, back arching, chest coming up off the bed.\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa makes a low noise, then pushes him back down with a hand to his nape and hits him again, the hardest so far, right against the meat of his ass. Atsumu groans in the aftermath, hips twitching consistently now. With Sakusa\u2019s hand on the back of his neck, he gives in completely, limp like a scruffed cat\u2014boneless except for the desperate little movements of his lower half.\n\n\nHe moans through the final three strikes, each harder than the last. He might be drooling again, he doesn\u2019t know. All he knows is that his ass feels like it\u2019s on fire and there\u2019s a shockingly large part of him that\u2019s disappointed when Sakusa begins murmuring that it\u2019s over.\n\n\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s ten. You took it well, Atsumu\u2026\u201d\n\n\nIt takes Sakusa\u2019s hand clamping down on his hip to realize he\u2019s still twitching them a little. Oh. He\u2019s hard again. \n\nReally \n\nhard, pressed into Sakusa\u2019s thigh and leaking onto the towel spread over his lap.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so worked up,\u201d Sakusa says, like he\u2019s commenting on the weather outside.\n\n\nAtsumu forces his body to stop moving, taking shuddering breaths. It\u2019s like the heat in his ass has migrated and concentrated between his legs.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he finds himself slurring. \u201cOmi, \n\nplease\n\n\u2026\u201d\n\n\nA hand smooths over his backside, the burning sensation igniting again wherever it makes contact.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already given you one,\u201d Sakusa says. Atsumu moans mournfully, hiding his face against the bed. \u201cIf you need to get off again you\u2019ll have to do it yourself.\u201d\n\n\nAtsumu squirms in confusion as Sakusa makes no moves to unbind him. How is he supposed to get himself off without\u2026\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa\u2019s hand presses down on Atsumu\u2019s tailbone. It clicks, triggering a hot shame that washes over his body.\u00a0\n\n\nHe hitches his hips once anyway, pressing his aching cock into Sakusa\u2019s thigh. He knows he was doing it unconsciously earlier, but this is different. That was a reaction, this is him \n\nhumping \n\nSakusa\u2019s thigh.\u00a0\n\n\nIt feels too good to refuse, though.\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa leaves his hand on Atsumu\u2019s neck, thumb drawing back and forth absently, as Atsumu begins to roll his hips in earnest. The dry towel is a little rough on his skin but Atsumu doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0\n\n\nHis ass stings and aches a little every time he tenses up to thrust and it drives Atsumu higher. He pants into the bed, rutting thoughtlessly. He\u2019s not sure how long it takes, but it certainly isn\u2019t much time until he feels the coiling pleasure in his gut concentrating.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOmi, Omi, m\u2019close\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe warns Sakusa instinctively, feeling like has to, he needs\u2014\n\n\nThe hand on his neck kneads lightly, \u201cGo on, Atsumu. Let go.\u201d\n\n\nFuck, he needs \n\nthat\n\n. Broken sounds pour from his lips as he spills into the towel, hips pumping erratically as his skin burns.\n\n\nAtsumu feels like he loses grip on reality for a moment. When he comes to, Sakusa has the cuffs off and is rubbing the feeling back into his arms. Sakusa helps Atsumu kneel up enough that he can get free from under him and guide him into a position on his side.\u00a0\n\n\nThrough bleary eyes, he watches Sakusa walk to the ensuite and return a moment later with a washcloth, warm and so soothing against his sticky skin. He keeps his gaze trained on Sakusa, still feeling really floaty in the afterglow.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cM\u2019sorry I couldn\u2019t\u2014hold out longer,\u201d he mumbles.\u00a0\n\n\nSakusa hushes him and actually runs his fingers through Atsumu\u2019s hair, pushing his sweat-damp bangs off his forehead. Atsumu closes his eyes and hums contentedly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou did extremely well for your first time,\u201d Sakusa says, and there\u2019s something genuine in his voice that makes Atsumu believe it\u2019s not just a platitude. \u201cIt takes practice. If you liked it, you can get better at it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did\u2026 like it. Wanna do better. I\u2019ll do better\u2026 next time...\u201d Atsumu murmurs, too caught up in the moment to think better of the loaded statement.\u00a0\n\n\nThe washcloth stills against his skin for just a second, then continues.\n\n\n\u201cYes. Next time.\u201d\n"
