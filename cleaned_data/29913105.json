    "text": "Tommy thought that the worst part about have no wings was the process of growing them in. How could it not be? That had hurt worse than hell.\nSo, of course, when Tommy woke up the next morning with an unfamiliar weight on his back, he thought the worst was over. The pain was done; now Tommy could wait for his feathers to grow in and learn to fly and have the time of his life.\nBut of course, things couldn\u2019t go to plan.\nBecause after Tommy sat up from his lying position in the bed, the first sound that came out of him was series of embarrassing peeps. Peeps. He was peeping.\nPhil, who was sleeping in a chair next Tommy\u2019s bed, woke up instantly, instantly hovering over Tommy.\n\u201cTommy, are you alright, mate?\u201d\nTommy nodded, horrified that his peeping intensified. \u201cDad,\u201d he moaned, peeping loudly, \u201cIt won\u2019t stop.\u201d\nPhil wrapped his arms around Tommy, causing Tommy\u2019s head to be rested against his chest. His wings wrapped around Tommy like a protective curtain.\nAnd the peeping stopped.\nRelief washed over Tommy, and he pulled away from Phil, who seemed reluctant to let him go.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tommy muttered, his face hot with embarrassment as he finally wrestled himself free of Phil\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cNo pro\u2014\u201d\nPhil was interrupted by another loud peep. Tommy smacked his hands over his mouth in horror.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Phil said, looking like he had finally realized something, \u201cUm, Tommy, mate, you might want to lean against me again.\u201d\nTommy was too mortified by the peeping that was now streaming out of his mouth to even argue as he rested his head back against Phil\u2019s shoulder.\nAnd, just like that, the peeping stopped again.\nThe dots were beginning to connect inside his mind, and Tommy was not okay with the implications.\n\u201cYou\u2019re imprinting,\u201d Phil said, rubbing Tommy\u2019s shoulder comfortingly, \u201cSometimes this happens when bird hybrids first get their wings in.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d Tommy moaned, leaning further into Phil\u2019s warmth.\nPhil chuckled. \u201cIt basically means that you are going to be following me or another bird hybrid around all day, and you won\u2019t stop peeping like that unless you have physical contact with that person.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tommy said in horror, instantly pushing himself away from Phil, \u201cI refuse. I will not\u2014\u201d\nMore damn peeping.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Phil said, instantly wrapping his arm around Tommy\u2019s shoulders, \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly get a say in this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to hold someone\u2019s hand all day?\u201d Tommy moaned.\nPhil hummed and nodded. \u201cPretty much. It might be for more than one day, who knows really.\u201d\nTommy swore. His reputation was going to be burnt to the dust by the time this was over. Wilbur was never going to let him live this down. Technoblade was probably never going to let him live this down. He was just going to be sad and lonely and known as clingy for the rest of his life.\n\nA little part of him was secretly glad that he had an excuse to be closer to people.\n\nTommy quickly squashed that part of him down. He was going to be in disgrace before the day was through.\n\u201cMy life is over.\u201d Tommy put his head in his hands. \u201cJust kill me now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Phil said, \u201cBesides, you rarely let me hug you anymore. This is the perfect excuse.\u201d\nTommy glared at Phil.\n\u201cYou are being incredibly clingy right now,\u201d he informed his father, clutching onto Phil\u2019s shirt.\nPhil nodded. \u201cM-hm, okay. Are you hungry? I can get you breakfast.\u201d\nTommy sighed and nodded reluctantly. Maybe, if he could just subtly hold onto Phil the entire time, Wilbur and Techno wouldn\u2019t even notice anything was awry, and his reputation would be spared.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Tommy sighed.\nTommy pulled himself out of bed, Phil\u2019s arm still firmly wrapped around his shoulders. They made it to the kitchen before Tommy\u2019s masterful plan went awry.\n\u201cAwww!\u201d Wilbur exclaimed almost the instant Tommy set foot into the kitchen, \u201cTechno, look how fluffy his wings are! They\u2019re like baby wings!\u201d\nTechno looked up from the book he was reading and sighed. \u201cYes, they are very fluffy.\u201d He returned to his book.\nAt least Tommy wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Techno teasing him. This was good, because it seemed that he would have to uphold every defense when it came to Wilbur.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said, squeezing Tommy\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit at the table? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nPhil took his hand off of Tommy\u2019s shoulder, and Tommy panicked as he felt a peep rise up from his chest. Instantly, he grabbed Phil\u2019s shirt and stuffed his face into the back of Phil\u2019s shoulder. The peep died down.\n\u201cAwwww,\u201d Wilbur said again, \u201cAre you feeling clingy today, Tommy?\u201d\nTommy flipped him off. \u201cPhil\u2019s the clingy one,\u201d he snapped.\n\u201cTommy, I can\u2019t make breakfast with you hanging off of me,\u201d Phil said patiently, \u201cI\u2019m sure Wilbur would be willing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Tommy said immediately, turning his head so that he could get a proper view of Wil.\nAs he expected, Wil\u2019s wings were perking up sinisterly. \u201cWilling to what?\u201d he asked, \u201cI\u2019m more than willing to let you cuddle with me, Toms, if that\u2019s what you need.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s face grew uncomfortably hot. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be cuddled,\u201d he snarled, forcing himself let go of Phil. Phil\u2019s wings twitched reluctantly.\nTommy forced himself to walk toward the table, but he was hardly two steps in before he started peeping loudly.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Wilbur breathed, grinning wildly, \u201cYou\u2019re like a baby chick or something.\u201d\nTommy backed away from Wilbur and clutched back onto Phil\u2019s arm, silencing the peeps. \u201cDad, Wilbur\u2019s bullying me.\u201d\nPhil laughed. \u201cWil, take Tommy please.\u201d\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Wilbur said, walking toward Tommy like he used too when he threatened tickling.\nTommy glared at Phil. \u201cTraitor.\u201d\nPhil looked entirely unapologetic as Wilbur wrapped his arms around Tommy and dragged him off of Phil. Tommy swore loudly, but he was horrified to find himself melting in Wilbur\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cThis is the best day of my life,\u201d Wilbur said, dragging Tommy over to the kitchen table, \u201cTechno, please take a picture of this.\u201d\nTechno hummed as he pulled his phone out of his pocket. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t deny myself some good blackmail,\u201d he said, snapping a picture of Tommy snuggling into Wilbur.\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Tommy muttered, \u201cI hate all of you so much.\u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Wilbur said, resting his chin on top of Tommy\u2019s head. He sat down at the table, having it so that Tommy was basically cuddling in his lap.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so damn clingy.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep telling yourself that,\u201d Techno said, returning to his book.\nPhil finally made them their breakfast, and Tommy forced himself out of Wilbur\u2019s lap so that he could eat with some semblance of dignity.\nExcept that Tommy was still peeping, and he was leaning both Phil and Wilbur\u2019s direction.\nDamn these stupid instincts.\nJust to oppose them, Tommy scooted his chair toward Techno, resting his head against his shoulder. Techno let out a startled grunt, and Wilbur blinked offendedly. Tommy flipped him off.\n\u201cBetrayal,\u201d Wilbur moaned dramatically, \u201cI have been betrayed! No snuggles with me, no more close proximity with adorable fluffy chick wings.\u201d\n\u201cHa, I am now the favorite sibling,\u201d Techno said, \u201cTake that, nerd.\u201d\n\u201cSays the person reading a book at the dinner table,\u201d Tommy muttered.\n\u201cHush, child cuddling deeper into me because of hybrid instincts,\u201d Techno said, \u201cyou know not of what you speak.\u201d\nTommy hated that Techno was correct. Tommy was cuddling deeper into him. He was warm, okay? It was better than peeping like a desperate baby bird at any rate.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m the smartest person here,\u201d Tommy remarked, \u201cYou are just jealous of my pure genius.\u201d\nTechno snorted, his wings fluffing slightly. \u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t need me, then,\u201d he said, getting out of his chair and away from Tommy, leaving Tommy cold again.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Tommy exclaimed indignantly as he started peeping downright aggressively, \u201cCome\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014back, jerk!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Toms,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cYou can lean against me.\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes, and instantly returned to Phil\u2019s side. Wilbur let out another betrayed noise. Phil wrapped one of his wings around Tommy protectively.\n\u201cUm\u2026 I hate to be the bearer of bad news,\u201d Techno said, \u201cbut today\u2019s a school day, and I have an important history test, and you have work, Phil, so\u2026\u201d\nTommy moaned. \u201cI am not going to school like this,\u201d he said instantly.\nPhil looked over to Wilbur. \u201cWould you be willing to stay with him?\u201d\nWilbur shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m helping with theater after school.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do, then?\u201d Tommy snapped, \u201cWill I just be alone in the house, peeping like a pitiful lost bird.\u201d\n\u201cYou do sound a little pitiful when you peep like that,\u201d Wilbur said. Tommy glared.\n\u201cWil,\u201d Phil sighed, \u201cStop teasing your brother.\u201d\nWilbur sniffed. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, \u201cIf he\u2019d cuddle with me.\u201d\nTommy snuggled deeper into Phil. \u201cYou,\u201d he announced, \u201care terrible.\u201d\n\u201cI am an opportunist,\u201d Wilbur corrected, \u201cAnd this is what I call a golden opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tommy said, \u201cI hate you. I am following Techno to school. And you are going to be all alone and very sad, Wilbur, and I will be like, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have teased me then, should you?\u2019 And you\u2019ll be sad forever.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Techno snorted, \u201cHe\u2019s got you there.\u201d He began packing his backpack. \u201cAlso, Tommy can\u2019t follow me. I literally just said I have a test. I\u2019m pretty sure my teacher isn\u2019t going to be happy with a freshman tagging along.\u201d\n\u201cWell your teacher can screw off,\u201d Tommy said, making grabby hands toward Techno.\nTechno sighed, walking over to Tommy. Tommy removed himself from Phil and latched onto him.\n\u201cI have acquired a child,\u201d Techno said in deadpan, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to school, you need to put on some actual clothes.\u201d\nTommy wrapped his arms around Techno more tightly, but he had a point. Tommy was still wearing some trashy pajamas. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered into Techno\u2019s soft wings.\n\u201cThat involves letting go of me.\u201d\n\u201cEscort me to my bedroom first, jerk.\u201d\n\u201cI am not your horse,\u201d Techno said, even as he started walking toward the stairs, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is my life now.\u201d\n\u201cWe can trade, Techno!\u201d Wilbur shouted after him, \u201cI\u2019ll take Tommy, and you can take cuddle deprived life.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, no,\u201d Techno said, \u201cI think I shall keep this child. He is mine now.\u201d\nTragically, they reached Tommy\u2019s bedroom, and Tommy had to let go of Techno so that he could change. Tommy\u2019s peeping got louder, faster, and all the more aggressive as he quickly searched for new clothes and fought to pull his shirt over his fluffy new wings. The peeping honestly almost felt like a bad case of the hiccups, although slightly less painful and all the more annoying.\nAs soon as he was dressed, Tommy dashed out of his room, desperate to stop the peeping, desperate to feel the warmth of someone else\u2019s body.\nHe crashed into Wilbur, and he couldn\u2019t even care that Wilbur had somehow managed to trick him.\n\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d Tommy informed Wilbur as he snuggled closer to Wilbur, \u201cThis is so damn terrible.\u201d\n\u201cThis is still the best day of my life,\u201d Wilbur said simply, like it was perfectly normal for one\u2019s teenage brother to be cursed with nonstop peeping unless he was hugging someone, \u201cThis is wonderful. I cannot wait to tell Schlatt\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you tell any of your friends about this,\u201d Tommy said, his voice dangerous, \u201cNobody will find your body.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d Wilbur said, sounding completely unconcerned.\nEventually, they all piled into the car, Pihl driving and Tommy sandwiched in between Techno and Wilbur in the back seat. Normally, the three of them would be scrambling for shotgun, but for some reason, Techno and Wilbur both wanted to snuggle with Tommy now that he was vulnerable and crap.\nTommy thought it was very rude.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t deny that it was very warm and comfortable so he decided not to complain too much.\n\u201cI hate you both,\u201d he muttered as Phil pulled the car to the front of the school.\n\u201cHave a good day boys!\u201d Phil called out as the three of them stumbled out of the car like some conga-line, \u201cAlso, you have my note for the teachers, right Tommy?\u201d\nTommy nodded, reaching into his pocket to feel the note that said something along the lines of: my son\u2019s hybrid instincts cause every other bird hybrid around him to be very clingy.\nThey got into the school building before the faced a bit of a problem.\n\u201cOkay, so this is where we have to part ways,\u201d Techno said, \u201cSo, Tommy, do you want to go with Wilbur, who you\u2019ve already technically sworn off, or do you want to go with me, who is superior in every other way?\u201d\nWilbur let out an offended snort. \u201cI thought you said you have a history test?\u201d he demanded, \u201cWouldn\u2019t I be the better choice?\u201d\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d Tommy began.\n\u201cMy test isn\u2019t until the afternoon,\u201d Techno pointed out, \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019m sure Tommy could be quiet\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhen has Tommy ever been quiet?\u201d\nTommy was growing increasingly uncomfortable over being argued over like some sort of prize. Then, as if bathed in holy light, Tommy saw his salvation walking into the entrance.\nAs Techno and Wilbur continued to argue, Tommy broke free from both of them, immediately bursting into loud peeps. Tommy covered his mouth (even though that had been proven to do nothing helpful), and dashed toward his salvation.\nTubbo looked at Tommy in surprise, his wings flaring. \u201cTommy? What are you\u2014\u201d\nTommy crashed into Tubbo, quickly wrapping an arm around his shoulder like he was greeting an old friend.\n\u201cBig T,\u201d he huffed, \u201cYou have to save me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026?\u201d Tubbo began, still looking confused out of his mind, \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d A grin formed on his face. \u201cAre you snuggling into me?\u201d\n\u201cYou always were a clingy one, Tubbo,\u201d Tommy grumbled, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you know that my hybrid instincts are forcing me to do this completely against my will.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tubbo said, nodding, \u201cYou must have the imprinting thing that happens sometimes when the wings grow in. Speaking of which, nice wings! They look very fluffy.\u201d\nTommy rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you get started,\u201d he groaned, \u201cWilbur cannot stop talking about how fluffy they are.\u201d\nTubbo started walking to class, and Tommy followed, ignoring Techno and Wilbur\u2019s betrayed looks.\nTubbo gave Tommy a weird look. \u201cUm\u2026 Tommy, our homerooms are different.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Tommy muttered, \u201cDad gave me a note. I can just hand it to teachers and they will understand that I have been cursed with disruptive peeping noises if I let go of anyone.\u201d\nTubbo\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCan I hear?\u201d\nTommy scowled. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\nHe did end up hearing, when Tubbo needed to go the bathroom and Tommy had to let go of him, Tommy let out a huge stream of peeps that caused the entire hall to stare at him.\n\n\u00a0\nTubbo, tragically, had to leave for a doctor\u2019s appointment after lunch.\nWhich left Tommy alone, peeping pitifully as he walked down the hallway to his next class.\nRemember when they tell you not to walk alone on the streets at night? Yeah, the same applied for high-school, especially if your fresh, fluffy wings and high-pitched peeping made you sound like a baby bird.\nAnd listen, he tried, he really did try to ignore the juniors\u2019 bullying jeers as he walked by, but it was really freaking hard when they actively tripped Tommy, causing him to stumble to the ground and let out a series of far more frantic peeps.\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d one of the bullies laughed, \u201cQuit acting like a baby!\u201d\nTommy scowled, jumping to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s not like\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014I can\u2014\u201d Peep \u201c\u2014control it\u2014\u201d Peep, peep. \u201c\u2014morons.\u201d\nThe bullies, which were a group of three, howled with laughter. \u201cHe looks like a tomato!\u201d cried out one, wiping away tears of laughter.\nTommy rolled his eyes, trying to ignore the way his fresh wings rose up defensively.\n\u201cYeah\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014yeah\u2014\u201d Peep, peep. \u201c\u2014real original.\u201d\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said the one who seemed to be the \u2018head-bully\u2019 if that was even a thing, \u201cWhat do you reckon will get him to do it more?\u201d\n\u201cDistress, maybe?\u201d one suggested, \u201cHe\u2019s doing it more than before.\u201d\nTommy clapped his hand over his mouth instinctively, trying to repress the steady stream of peeping coming out of his mouth. Logically, he knew the best thing to do for himself was to run. But he was a big man. He wasn\u2019t about to run home crying over a few bullies.\nOkay, so maybe after the first punch, Tommy should\u2019ve run instead of punching back, especially when the junior was twice his size and wasn\u2019t adjusting to life with a fresh weight on his back. In Tommy\u2019s defense, what else did one expect?\nThe bullies got about two punches in, causing Tommy to let out very loud and extra pitiful peeps, when someone rested a hand on Tommy\u2019s shoulder. Tommy\u2019s peeps quieted down almost instantly.\n\u201cWhat do you idiots think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Technoblade said, wrapping his arm fully around Tommy\u2019s shoulders.\nTommy leaned into Technoblade\u2019s side, grinning at the bullies. They were so screwed.\nFrom the way they looked like they were cowering from Technoblade with fear in their eyes, they knew it too.\nTechnoblade spread his wings out, making him look incredibly intimidating. \u201cGive me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t beat you to the ground for attacking my little brother?\u201d\nTommy almost laughed at the raw horror on his attackers faces. Served them right.\nStill\u2026 Technoblade did have that history test, and it would be a shame for him to be sent to the principal\u2019s office on Tommy\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s okay, big man,\u201d Tommy said, snuggling deeper into Techno\u2019s warmth, \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that much\u2014\u201d Actually, Tommy\u2019s face was still throbbing from where they hit him. \u201c\u2014I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve learned their lesson.\u201d\nTechnoblade let out a deep breath through his nose. \u201cFine,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, he pointed at the three boys threateningly, \u201cBut I will be reporting you three to the teachers.\u201d\nAnd with that, Technoblade spun around and led Tommy down the hall. Once they were a safe distance away, Technoblade gently grabbed Tommy by the shoulders and turned him around so that Tommy was properly facing him.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Technoblade asked, sounding strangely protective, \u201cIt\u2019s bruising, do you need an ice-pack for that? Do you need me to call Phil? Wilbur?\u201d\nTommy raised his eyebrows, a little bit surprised, if he was being honest. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Techno,\u201d he said, \u201cLet\u2019s just get to your class, you have that test, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re more important than some dumb history test,\u201d Techno said gruffly, \u201cBut if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re alright, then I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d\nTommy nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he repeated, \u201cNow can I lean against you again? Or are you not done inspecting every inch of me?\u201d\nTechnoblade let out a small chuckle, wrapping his arm around Tommy and allowing Tommy to burrow deeper into his side. They continued walking down the nearly empty halls. The final bell had rung a few minutes before.\n\u201cThanks, by the way,\u201d Tommy murmured, \u201cI could\u2019ve handled it, but it\u2019s nice to finally stop the damn peeping for once.\u201d\n\u201cYeah sure,\u201d Techno said casually, \u201cIt was no problem. But where\u2019s your friend, Tubbo, was it? The one you ditched us for?\u201d\nTommy laughed loudly at the memory.\n\u201cYeah, he had to go to a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d Tommy said, \u201cSo that didn\u2019t work out, did it?\u201d\n\u201cNext time, get me or Wilbur, okay?\u201d\nTommy nodded. Getting mercilessly mocked wasn\u2019t actually something he wished to re-experience. \u201cWilbur\u2019s going to be so mad when he hears about this,\u201d he sniggered.\nTechno grinned. \u201cWhat a loser.\u201d\nTechno stopped in front of a door, probably the one to his classroom. \u201cAlright, this is my classroom, so try not to be too loud, okay? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they haven\u2019t already started testing.\u201d\nTommy nodded, and Techno opened the door and entered. Inside, students were already scribbling on a sheet of paper on their desks.\n\u201cTechnoblade,\u201d the teacher\u2014Mr. Nook, Tommy instantly recognized his green hair\u2014said almost instantly, not looking up from whatever paper he was looking down at, \u201cYou are late.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Technoblade grunted, \u201cI had to rescue my brother from some bullies, looked to be juniors.\u201d\nMr. Nook looked up and smiled when he saw Tommy snuggled up against Technoblade. All of the other students looked up from their tests as well, and Tommy resisted the temptation to hide his face in Technoblade\u2019s sweater. As it was, Technoblade wrapped one of his pink wings around him protectively.\n\u201cHey, Tommy,\u201d Mr. Nook said kindly, \u201cYou got your wings in recently?\u201d\nTommy forced himself to speak. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cPretty pog, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cDo you need ice for those bruises?\u201d Mr. Nook asked, his brow furrowing in concern.\nTommy sighed defeatedly. If he was going to be constantly asked that, he might as well just succumb before it becomes too aggravating.\n\u201cYes please,\u201d he said, wrapping another arm around Techno without even thinking about it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s imprinting,\u201d Techno explained, \u201cCan\u2019t stop peeping unless someone\u2019s hugging him.\u201d\nMr. Nook nodded understandingly. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can pull up a chair next to your desk for Tommy, and then get started on your test. I\u2019ll go get some ice.\u201d\nThey did exactly that, and Tommy scooted his chair next to Techno\u2019s as much as possible before leaning sleepily against Techno\u2019s form. Techno wrapped his wing around him again, which really did not help with Tommy\u2019s sleepy mood.\nIt also did not improve either of their reputations.\n\u201cWow, Techno\u2019s a big softy inside, huh?\u201d a senior whispered from the desk in front of Techno, \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought?\u201d\nTechno huffed. \u201cOh, shut up, Dream,\u201d he muttered, \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Dream muttered, returning to his test with an eye-roll.\nTommy sniggered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ruining my reputation,\u201d Techno muttered under his breath as he circled the answer on his test.\n\u201cGot to drag someone down with me,\u201d Tommy replied, smirking.\nMr. Nook returned with a tower wrapped around some ice, stopping all potential conversation.\n\u00a0\nWilbur was appropriately outraged by the time he realized that he had missed out on school cuddling.\n\u201cI thought you were with Tubbo?!\u201d he demanded as they climbed into the car, \u201cHow did Techno end up stealing you?\u201d\n\u201cSimple really,\u201d Techno said as he buckled his seat-belt with a click, \u201cI am the cooler sibling.\u201d\nWilbur gaped, his eyes darting back and forth between Tommy and Techno. \u201cYou are not the cooler sibling,\u201d he stated, \u201cTommy, I\u2019m the cooler sibling. Tell me I\u2019m the cooler sibling.\u201d\nAllowing himself to be comfortably sandwiched between both Techno and Wil, Tommy hummed as if pondering the statement. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPhil,\u201d Wilbur moaned as Phil started driving again, \u201cPhil, Tommy and Techno are bullying me.\u201d\nPhil grinned. \u201cAw, come on, Wil,\u201d he said, \u201cWe all know that you are the coolest sibling.\u201d\nWilbur straightened. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, gesturing at Phil gratefully. He turned to Tommy and Techno. \u201cYou see\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTied with Techno, of course,\u201d Phil added.\nTommy cackled.\n\u201cTied?\u201d both Techno and Wilbur demanded at the same time.\n\u201cJinx,\u201d Tommy said before they could get the word in, \u201cHa, now you both cannot speak unless someone says your name.\u201d\n\u201cHey Techno,\u201d Phil said immediately, \u201cHow did your history test go?\u201d\nTommy let out an indignant squawk as Techno smirked. Wilbur pouted, burrowing his face into Tommy\u2019s hair.\n\u201cIt was good,\u201d Techno said, \u201cI even had Tommy snuggling up against me this whole time, so that was pretty nice.\u201d\nWilbur wrapped both of his arms around Tommy in retaliation.\n\u201cAnd who about you, Wil?\u201d Phil asked, \u201cDid you have a good day at school?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wilbur sulked, \u201cI am very sad and alone and neglected because Tommy decided to snuggle with Techno but not with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are snuggling with me right now,\u201d Tommy pointed out, \u201cSo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlso Tommy\u2019s face is bruised,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cAnd I am worried.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil asked, his voice slightly sharper than before, \u201cToms, mate, what happened?\u201d\nTommy huffed. \u201cJust a couple of bullies,\u201d he said, trying to sound casual, \u201cThought my peeping was funny or something like that. Techno scared him off.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Wilbur demanded, hugging Tommy so close that his head was basically resting against Wilbur\u2019s chest, \u201cI will hunt them down and make them beg for mercy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d Tommy muttered.\n\u201cYeah, it kinda was,\u201d Technoblade said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dad, I told my teacher about them; he said he\u2019d deal with it.\u201d\nWilbur snorted. \u201cYeah, like that\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Nook\u2019s not like the rest,\u201d Tommy said, \u201cHe got me an icepack and didn\u2019t demand to see the note.\u201d\nThe other teachers had demanded to see the note, probably thinking that this was a silly excuse Tommy had come up with to skip on his own classes.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Phil said.\n\u00a0\nAll was well until Tommy had to go to bed.\n\u201cYou can sleep with me if you want, mate,\u201d Phil said as he led Tommy to his bedroom with his hands around Tommy\u2019s shoulders.\nTommy scowled, shaking his head firmly. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI am a big man; I can sleep by myself.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said, sounding reluctant.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tommy agreed, staring at the door to his bedroom, \u201cThis is it. I will not see you until morning.\u201d\n\u201cToms.\u201d Phil squeezed his shoulder gently. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling up to it, nobody will judge you for sleeping with me or one of your brothers for the night.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so clingy,\u201d Tommy grumbled, \u201cI\u2019m fine. You guys have been smothering me all day. I need some alone time.\u201d\nThey continued standing there, Tommy making no move to remove himself from Phil\u2019s arm.\n\u201cDo you want me to do it?\u201d Phil asked gently.\nTommy sighed, completely humiliated. \u201cYes, please.\u201d\nPhil nodded and slowly let go of Tommy\u2019s shoulder. As soon as the contact was completely severed, Tommy felt a chill in his body, and a series of peeps started coming out.\n\u201cTommy, are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure!\u201d Tommy shouted, yanking his door open, dashing into his room, and slamming the door closed behind him.\nThe peeps were getting louder now, and Tommy sunk to the ground, trying not to feel absolutely miserable as his peeps got more and more desperate.\nHe was fine. Everything was fine. Tommy was going to crawl into bed and sleep like a normal hybrid. Then, he would pop out of the bed the next morning completely peep free.\nWith a sigh, Tommy burrowed himself into his bed and prayed that the peeping would quiet down for the rest of the occupants of the house.\nIt didn\u2019t.\nTommy lasted about one hour. Or, to be more accurate, Wilbur, Techno, and Phil lasted for one hour. Tommy was not planning on leaving his bedroom, regardless of how loud his peeping got or how little sleep he received.\nWilbur, Techno, and Phil did not seem to agree with him on that point, as Tommy heard the door crack open after an hour of hoping his peeping would shut the hell up.\n\u201cTommy?\u201d Wilbur whispered, \u201cAre you alright in there?\u201d\n\u201cCan we come in?\u201d Phil asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting worried,\u201d Techno finished.\nTommy groaned dramatically, trying to ignore the way his peeping somehow managed to get more desperate at the entrance of his family.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Peep, peep, peep. \u201c\u2014fine\u2014\u201d Peep, Peep, Peep, Peep. \u201c\u2014damnit.\u201d\n\u201cHate to break it to you,\u201d Techno said dryly, \u201cBut peeping like you are crying for your parents does not exactly sound fine.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think any of us are going to get any sleep like this,\u201d Wilbur said lightheartedly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a family movie night?\u201d\nIt was one o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\u201cWilbur\u2019s got a point,\u201d Phil said gently, \u201cWhat do you say, mate?\u201d\nTommy succumbed, practically leaping out of his bed and sprinting into Phil, wrapping his arms tightly around him. Phil let out a startled \u201cumph\u201d before returning Tommy\u2019s embrace.\nThe peeping in the back of his throat died out, and Tommy felt warm again.\nThey all returned to the living room, where Tommy became the center of a cuddle pile. Phil made hot-chocolate and popcorn, and they played Up. Come on, this was Tommy they were talking about.\n\u201cLove you guys,\u201d Tommy muttered sleepily.\nHis statement was received with various \u201cawwws\u201d and \u201cyou toos\u201d and hair ruffles.\nTommy fell asleep about twenty-minutes into the movie, safely snuggled up against his family, his flock.\nTommy had hoped that things would return to normal the next morning.\nThis, unfortunately, was not the case.\nHe woke up with his face resting comfortably against his father\u2019s chest, and Tommy took a moment to just keep his eyes closed, relaxing into the warmth of his dad. It felt good.\nHe kind of wanted this moment to last forever.\nUnfortunately, Tommy heard bustling in the kitchen, and he knew that it would only be a matter of time before he was forced awake for breakfast and schoolwork.\n\u201cIs he still asleep?\u201d Wilbur asked from the kitchen, \u201cI could get a turn with him, you know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be greedy, Wil,\u201d Technoblade said to the sound of clinking glasses.\nWilbur made a scoffing sound. \u201cThat\u2019s easier for you to say,\u201d he snapped, \u201cYou got to keep him for the entire day. I, on the other hand\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Phil said calmly, his chest vibrating against Tommy\u2019s ear as he spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t argue while your brother is sleeping.\u201d\nPhil brought a hand around Tommy\u2019s shoulders, and Tommy never felt safer in his life.\nTommy rested to the sound of the table being set for a little longer, trying not to nestle himself deeper into Phil\u2019s warmth as Phil began gently stroking his down feathers.\n\u201cToms,\u201d Phil whispered, nudging Tommy\u2019s shoulder slightly, \u201cToms, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d\nTommy reluctantly opened his eyes, making a grumbling sound and blinking at the sudden light.\nPhil laughed. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cBut you have to wake up now. Breakfast.\u201d\nSitting up, Tommy tried not to look to disappointed at leaving Phil\u2019s wonderful warmth. He was a big man. He didn\u2019t need to cling to his dad like some sort of baby.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Technoblade asked from the kitchen.\nTommy gave Techno a tired thumbs up. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said tiredly, \u201cAbsolutely\u2014\u201d He yawned. \u201c\u2014fantastic.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, mate,\u201d Phil said. He squeezed Tommy\u2019s shoulders one last time before letting go and standing up from his position on the couch, and it felt as though something had doused Tommy into ice-cold water. \u201cHow\u2019s the peep\u2014\u201d\nTommy let out a series of peeps, and he resisted the urge to scream into the oblivion.\nTommy felt his face grow warm, and he tried to swallow down the peeping sound as he considered just melting into the floor and ceasing to exist. He thought he\u2019d be done with this peeping business by now.\nPhil smiled and wrapped his arm around Tommy\u2019s shoulder, and Tommy melted in the touch, relieved to hear the stupid sound go away.\n\u201cGuess not, huh?\u201d he asked.\nTommy scowled, stuffing his hands into his pockets in a last-ditch effort to maintain his dignity.\n\u201cI thought they\u2019d be done by now.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, mate,\u201d Phil said, looking like he was trying to sound sympathetic but was really trying to resist the urge not to laugh, which Tommy found incredibly insulting, \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to last for a few more days.\u201d\nTommy groaned as Phil led him to the kitchen. \u201cBut Phil\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, I, for one,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cDon\u2019t see a problem with this.\u201d\nTommy glared at Wilbur, who was looking way too pleased with himself. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d Wilbur continued, going on as if he hadn\u2019t heard Tommy as he poured himself some orange juice, \u201cThere was a horrible unbalance of power yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Techno asked as he began eating his cereal, \u201cAnd what was that?\u201d\nWilbur gave Technoblade a withering glare. \u201cYou kept Tommy all to yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s time for some pay-back.\u201d\nFirst of all, this sounded like a crappy plot for a cartoon episode. Second of all, what the heck was going on.\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Tommy interrupted, grateful that Phil hadn\u2019t taken his hand off Tommy\u2019s shoulder as they sat in the seats adjacent to each other, \u201cDo I get a say in any of this?\u201d\nWilbur and Techno both looked at Tommy and said in unison, \u201cNo.\u201d\nTommy squawked indignantly.\nWilbur and Techno continued arguing. \u201cWilbur, it\u2019s not my fault that you didn\u2019t cease the moment like I did,\u201d Technoblade said, \u201cBesides, Tommy chose me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe chose Tubbo,\u201d Wilbur snapped back, \u201cAt best, that makes you his second choice.\u201d\nTechno grinned. \u201cDoes that mean you were his third?\u201d\nWilbur let out a growling sound, scooping up some of his cereal with his spoon and moving the utensil into a catapult position.\n\u201cTake that back,\u201d he whispered.\nTechno only grinned all the wider, leaning back in his chair. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d\nTommy could practically hear the epic theme music playing in the background as Wilbur closed one eye to take aim.\n\u201cNope, not doing that,\u201d Phil interrupted, snatching the spoon out of Wilbur\u2019s hands before Wilbur could do anything to stop him.\nWilbur let out a whining sound. \u201cBut Phil\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe are not starting a food fight at the breakfast table,\u201d Phil said firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s final.\u201d\nBoth Wilbur and Techno sulked, and Wilbur had to get up to grab a new spoon so that he could finish his breakfast.\nAfter that, it was a relatively peaceful breakfast.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said, placing his spoon down with a clink when they were done, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Tommy. Do you want to go with Wilbur or Techno? Or do you want to come to work with me?\u201d\nTommy\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI can go to work with you?\u201d he asked, \u201cThat\u2019s allowed?\u201d\nPhil nodded. \u201cI called the office yesterday,\u201d he said, \u201cThey said as long as you weren\u2019t too much of a distraction, it was fine for you to go.\u201d\nThat was actually an incredibly tempting offer. Especially when Wilbur seemed to think that Tommy was some sort of prize, and Technoblade\u2026 well, Technoblade already had his turn with cuddling Tommy. Not to mention, he didn\u2019t actually want to get anyone in trouble with the teachers again.\n\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Tommy said, \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\nWilbur let out a dramatic cry to the ceiling. \u201cBetrayal,\u201d he moaned, \u201cWhy must you do this to me? What have I ever done to you? All I want are my Tommy cuddles, and I am rejected at every turn.\u201d\nTechnoblade laughed. \u201cHaha, take that nerd.\u201d\nTommy sighed with exasperation.\nPhil escorted Tommy back upstairs, and Tommy hurriedly got ready for his day, trying to get it done as quickly as possible before the peeps became a loud battle cry, because that was really the last thing he needed.\nWhen he was done brushing his teeth, he burst out of the bathroom and slammed himself into Phil, wrapping his arms tightly around him.\nPhil returned the embrace. \u201cYou ready to go, buddy?\u201d\nTommy nodded, too pleased that he stopped the peeping and got a hug to be embarrassed about it. He\u2019d be more embarrassed later when he had to follow Phil around in his office and hope that Phil\u2019s coworkers wouldn\u2019t decide to laugh at him.\nThe car ride, unfortunately, was somewhat tricky.\nAt first, it was fine. Tommy was wedged in between Techno and Wil as they both played tug-a-war with who got to hug Tommy the longest in the car, which really just ended with Tommy being the insides of a human sandwich.\nIt was pretty nice, though, so Tommy wasn\u2019t complaining.\nThe issue, unfortunately, arose when Wilbur and Technoblade got out of the car so that they could go to school.\nThe peeping started back up almost instantly.\n\u201cUh\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014Phil\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014problem.\u201d\nAs Tommy wrapped his arms around himself in an attempt to cease the peeping, Phil quickly glanced back at Tommy as he drove out of the parking lot and grimaced.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you think you can reach my shoulders from there, or do you need to climb over to the front seat?\u201d\nTommy unwound his arms around himself, still peeping annoyingly, and he reached over the front seat to grab onto Phil\u2019s shoulders. It was mildly uncomfortable, and it didn\u2019t feel quite as good as it might to get a hug or arms around his shoulders, but it got the peeping to die down, so there was that.\nThe rest of the car ride was done in that awkward position, and Tommy couldn\u2019t be more relieved when they finally made it to Phil\u2019s office building.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Phil said as he parked the car, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nTommy forced himself to let go of Phil, unbuckle his seatbelt, and hurry out of the vehicle. Now that he was in a public area, the loudness of his peeping seemed all the more obvious, and he was immensely relieved when Phil got out of the car, allowing Tommy to press himself up against his side.\nPhil placed his arm around Tommy\u2019s shoulders again and wrapped a wing protectively around him.\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Phil asked.\nTommy nodded. \u201cAs long as your coworkers don\u2019t laugh at me,\u201d he grumbled.\nPhil chuckled. \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d\nAnd with that, they headed inside.\nThe lady at the front desk didn\u2019t comment on Phil bringing a teenager into the office. As a matter of fact, most people didn\u2019t even seem to care. They made it safely to Phil\u2019s cubicle without any incident.\nPhil pulled a chair next to his own, and Tommy flopped into it, instinctually spinning it around.\nThen his peeping started back up, so he had to scooch the chair close to Phil\u2019s so that Tommy could rest his face against Phil\u2019s shoulder. Phil moved his wing so that it was covering both Tommy and his chair from onlookers, and it was pretty nice.\nTommy watched contentedly as Phil began to type away on his computer, writing words that Tommy could barely understand. He didn\u2019t really care that much about Phil\u2019s job, to be honest, but the office was nice and quiet, and Phil was letting Tommy snuggle as close to him as possible from a separate chair, and the sound of Phil\u2019s fingers against the keyboard was immensely satisfying.\nTommy\u2019s eyelids drooped a little bit, and he fell into a doze.\nThe next thing Tommy knew, Phil was shaking his shoulder again. Tommy jolted awake, glancing at the clock on Phil\u2019s computer screen.\nHow was it already noon?\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy asked in confusion, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou feel asleep, mate,\u201d Phil said quietly, smiling at Tommy\u2019s confusion, \u201cDid you have a nice nap?\u201d\nTommy blushed. \u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Phil asked, \u201cWe can grab some lunch at the cafeteria.\u201d\nTommy was, in fact, hungry, so they marched down to the cafeteria, Tommy\u2019s body half-hidden by the embrace of Phil\u2019s wings. Tommy didn\u2019t mind too much, though. Sometimes someone would give Phil a strange look, and Phil would simply say \u201cimprinting\u201d before their face cleared, and they made some understanding remark.\nPhil got Tommy a pizza and can of coke at the cafeteria, and they returned to the cubicle to eat.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not too bored,\u201d Phil said as Tommy leaned against Phil, taking a bite out of his delicious pizza, \u201cJust watching me work.\u201d\nTommy shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d he said, \u201cBetter than the peeping, at any rate.\u201d\nPhil chuckled. \u201cFair enough.\u201d\nTommy did, in fact, pull out his phone for the reminder of the afternoon, still keeping his face against Phil\u2019s shoulder as Phil continued to work.\nEventually, Phil and Tommy left to pick Techno up from school. Wilbur had theatre after school, which Tommy was under the impression was supposed to happen yesterday, but he supposed it must\u2019ve been moved.\nAs soon as Techno got into the car, Tommy launched on top of him, relieved to not have to be in that awkward shoulder holding position anymore.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Techno said, \u201cAre you sure I\u2019m not the favorite sibling? I mean, with that sort of welcoming committee\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Tommy muttered, his voice muffled since his face was in Techno\u2019s shirt, \u201cThis is just a necessary evil.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Techno said skeptically, moving further into the car and buckling his seatbelt, \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\nTommy moved his face so that he\u2019d no longer be speaking into Techno\u2019s shirt. \u201cI do say so,\u201d he said resolutely.\n\u00a0\nWhen they got home, the next few hours was spent with Tommy going back and forth between cuddling Techno and cuddling Phil, which would\u2019ve been embarrassing if Tommy just wasn\u2019t so used to it by now.\nBesides, Tommy wasn\u2019t about to deny that the cuddling didn\u2019t feel good. Because it actually felt very good. Amazingly good. Spectacularly good.\nAnd then Wilbur burst through the doors, his entire body radiating an intense energy that Tommy couldn\u2019t begin to decipher if it was rage or excitement or pure evil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now,\u201d he said. He got down on one knee in front of Tommy and Techno, who was doing his homework on the couch, \u201cTommy, please, I beseech thee, let me have a turn to cuddle you. I never get to cuddle you, and I want a turn to carry you around on my back or something, please, I will do anything\u2014\u201d\nTommy grinned. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked.\nWilbur nodded, his brown curls bouncing up and down frantically. \u201cAnything.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how Wilbur found himself handing over his fluffiest yellow sweater over to Tommy, a look of resignation on his face.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you convinced me to do this,\u201d he said grimly, watching as Tommy eagerly put the thing over his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Peep. \u201c\u2014warm,\u201d Tommy protested, practically drowning in the amazingly too large size of the thing, his hands not even peeking out from the sleeves.\nWilbur sighed. \u201cYou better not stain that, it\u2019s my favorite,\u201d he said.\nTommy nodded impatiently. \u201cOkay\u2014\u201d Peep, peep. \u201c\u2014okay. Can we get on with the hugging or have you changed your mind?\u201d\nA look of pure panic came across Wilbur\u2019s face, and he quickly launched onto Tommy before Tommy could get another peep out.\n\u201cPlease, do not abandon me,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cFinally, I get to hug my little brother without Techno stealing you, I cannot miss this moment.\u201d\nTommy let out a startled laugh from within Wilbur\u2019s arms.\n\u201cYou were really desperate, huh?\u201d\nWilbur sighed dramatically. \u201cI will carry this secret to the grave,\u201d he said, \u201cBut you give the best hugs.\u201d\nTommy felt his entire body grow warm at that, and he resisted the urge to sink further into the fluffy sweater to hide how red his face probably was.\n\u201cI do not,\u201d he protested.\nWilbur nodded, leading Tommy to sit on Wilbur\u2019s bed. \u201cYou do,\u201d he said, \u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not even hugging you back,\u201d Tommy pointed out as Wilbur opened up his laptop and pulled up Netflix. \u201cI\u2019m literally just leaning against you while you have your arm wrapped around my shoulders.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the point,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cIt\u2019s a big brother thing, you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\nTommy snorted. \u201cSounds more like a you thing than a big brother thing.\u201d \n\u201cShut up, Tommy.\u201d\nTommy cackled.\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, the peeping actually stopped.\nTommy tried not to be too disappointed about it as he trudged around the kitchen, completely hug free. He should be happy. He should be the happiest person in the world. Finally, he was free from being tethered to another human being. Finally, he could go about his normal life.\nPhil walked into the kitchen and gave Tommy a quick hug, ruffling his hair. \u201cThe peeping stopped?\u201d Phil asked heading to the pantry.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tommy said, hoping he didn\u2019t sound like he was sulking, since that would be stupid.\n\u201cAre you relieved?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Tommy muttered, hugging himself slightly.\nWilbur and Techno walked into the room next, and Techno raised his eyebrows upon seeing Tommy not latched onto Phil.\n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s done now,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cWell, that was early.\u201d\nTechno shrugged, moving to the table and opening up his book. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d\nA lump rose to Tommy\u2019s throat, and he quickly moved to swallow it down.\nThe peeping was done. He couldn\u2019t expect his family members to randomly hug him now. That wasn\u2019t how it worked.\nThe rest of the day had a sort of gloom to it, even though Tommy tried to hide it. He laughed about the peeping to Tubbo, saying that he was relieved that it was finally done.\nWhen Phil picked them up, Techno was sitting in the front seat, and the middle seat left a gap that felt like a gaping chasm between Tommy and Wilbur.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Tommy was halfway through his homework that he finally cracked, slamming his forehead against the table.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Wilbur asked from the couch, looking up from his phone.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Tommy muttered, not picking his head back up, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that was convincing,\u201d Techno said, having marched downstairs for whatever reason, \u201cseriously, what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d\nTommy swallowed down the lump that had returned to his throat.\n\u201cI just\u2026 I didn\u2019t hate the last couple of days as much as I might have made it seem.\u201d\nThere was a silence as Wilbur and Techno digested the words, and Tommy already felt the heat creeping back up to his cheeks. Oh god, they were going to think he was so childish now. Why did he say that?\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wilbur said simply, \u201cTommy, you can hug us whenever you want.\u201d\nTommy shot up, staring at Wilbur in shock.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Techno said, shrugging, \u201cI mean, I know we don\u2019t mind, and Phil definitely won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tommy asked, \u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 find that annoying?\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously there\u2019s a time and a place,\u201d Wilbur said, \u201cBut right now, at home, I don\u2019t see a problem with it.\u201d\nTommy looked away. \u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh for goodness sakes,\u201d Techno said, his voice lined with exasperation as he marched toward Tommy and grabbed him by the shoulder, pulling him into a hug.\nTommy stiffened before melting into the sudden embrace.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Techno asked, \u201cIt\u2019s that easy.\u201d\nWilbur shot up from the couch, dashing over so that he could hug Tommy as well.\n\u201cAnd remember?\u201d Wilbur asked, \u201cYou\u2019re the best at hugging.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m standing right here,\u201d Techno said dryly.\n\u201cShut up, Techno,\u201d Wilbur said, burying his face into Tommy\u2019s hair.\nTommy smiled, relieve flooding his chest. \u201cThanks guys.\u201d\n\u201cWait, there\u2019s only three out of four,\u201d Techno said, \u201cThat\u2019s disgraceful. Phil! Phil! We need you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice came from downstairs, and it was soon accompanied by loud footsteps.\n\u201cWe need you for a cuddle pile!\u201d Wilbur informed him.\nPhil appeared, and his concerned frown turned into a smile as he saw the group hug that Tommy was stuck in.\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he said understandingly. He joined the hug, wrapping both of his wings protectively around all of them. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the peeping as an excuse to get hugs, Tommy.\u201d\nTommy smiled, barely able to see between his three family members hugging him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all very clingy,\u201d he informed them, \u201cI think you might have the peeping problem now.\u201d\nThey laughed, and Tommy smiled."
