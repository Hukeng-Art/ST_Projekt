    "text": "\u00a0\n1.\nThe other fellow Avengers notice it right away\u2014this beyond-comfortable vibe that consistently floats between Bucky and Steve.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s how there doesn\u2019t seem to be any kind of personal space between them.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s how they know nearly all there is to know about each other.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s how they often find themselves in situations that others would deem uncomfortable, but they don\u2019t even bat an eyelash.\nIt hasn\u2019t been a week before Bucky enters the common area in Avengers Tower, groaning about the tension in his shoulders. Bruce offhandedly mentions a treatment that he learned during his own bouts of stress, to which Bucky mutters some noncommittal grunt of thanks before plopping down and settling between Steve\u2019s legs on the floor, his back to Steve\u2019s chest.\nThe glance between Natasha and Clint is quick but pointed.\nSteve gently tosses his book to the side and then places his hands on Bucky\u2019s shoulders, kneading thoroughly against the impressively tense muscles. Bucky sighs, his eyes falling shut and mouth dropping open in a mixture of slight pain but mostly relief.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he groans, leaning into the touch.\nClint snickers quietly, trying to busy himself with pouring milk into a bowl of cereal before one of his trademark sarcastic comments can escape him and make the situation more awkward than it\u2019s already quickly becoming.\nSteve slides his left hand over just a touch, massaging into a particularly tense spot that makes Bucky drop his head, eyes still closed. \u201cRight there?\u201d\nBucky moans quietly, his body relaxing against Steve\u2019s hands. \u201cFuck, Steve.\u201d\nIf either of them really cared, or really considered that this might not be the way a normal pair of men might interact with each other, they might have noticed how Tony has halted mid-step in the doorway, an eyebrow raised as he glances in.\nAnd Clint\u2019s just staring into his bowl, trying so hard not to grin with a mouthful of cereal but failing miserably because really? How can these two not realize what they sound like right now?\nTony sticks his head in the doorway. \u201cHey Buck Rogers, you\u2019re not slumming it anymore, you know,\u201d he says, trying to be helpful, \u201cWe have people for that kind of stuff now. Trained people. Masseurs and whatnot.\u201d\nBut Bucky lets out another quiet little moan as that super tense spot gets rubbed out satisfyingly. \u201cSteve knows how I like it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sputtering sound from over by the sink where Clint has finally lost all ability to reign himself in, that last comment enough to pull a pointed laugh out of him, cereal spraying everywhere.\nTony examines the spectacle that the common area has become before turning on his heels, wondering why he even stopped in the first place. \u201cI bet he does.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re super affectionate toward one another, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s usually a whole lot of unnecessary touching when it comes to carrying out the simplest of tasks. Or like, it\u2019s possible to sit on the gigantic half-moon couch that everyone shares without practically being in the other\u2019s left pocket. But yet and still\u2026\nAnd it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re aware that they\u2019re doing it either, Clint and Tony eventually realize. It\u2019s totally normal for Steve and Bucky to nearly mold into one being whenever they\u2019re near each other.\nClint chuckles like he\u2019s five. Tony does too, let\u2019s not deny it, but he also wants to maybe test out a theory he has. Like how Steve and Bucky don\u2019t bat an eyelash at sharing food or whatever they might be drinking at the time.\nSteve\u2019s at the counter one morning, groggy as fuck as he sips the coffee that he\u2019s poured into his gigantic red mug. He\u2019s about to dive back in for another drink when Bucky appears, hair defying gravity as it sticks in every direction imaginable. And not even touching on the fact that that\u2019s definitely Steve\u2019s shirt that he\u2019s wearing because it\u2019s way too big on him, the calm between them isn\u2019t so much as nudged out of place as Bucky reaches out, his hand clamping down on Steve\u2019s giant red mug and pulling it out of his friend\u2019s grasp.\u00a0 He downs half the cup at an impressive speed, his head tipping back and throat working smoothly as he swallows the life-source that he\u2019s learned to run on.\nThen he hands the mug back to Steve without looking, who doesn\u2019t even react except for taking another sip as he goes over to the coffee pot for a refill. Like it\u2019s no big deal. Like they do it every morning. Because they do.\n\u201cPlenty of mugs in the cabinet, you know,\u201d Tony says, but his eyes are locked onto the smirk that\u2019s slowly stretching across Clint\u2019s face as he looks at him.\nBucky and Steve shrug. In unison.\n\u201cThey\u2019re best friends,\u201d Natasha states warily that night when Clint and Tony corner her and ask for an opinion.\n\u201cGerms,\u201d Tony declares, his hands gesturing plainly as if to make his point. \u201cDisease. Mouth herpes. Should I continue?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cListen, all I\u2019m saying is there has to be a reason they\u2019re so touchy feely all the time.\u201d\nNatasha raises an eyebrow at him, realizing now that she probably won\u2019t get back to her mission research as soon as she wants to. So she says it again. \u201cThey\u2019re best friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.\nBucky likes Clint, he\u2019ll admit it. Coming across a kindred spirit in sarcasm is a difficult task, and Bucky thinks he might have just found one. Even now, as they sit in Steve\u2019s living room while said blonde is too busy taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom to join them, Clint and Bucky are knee-deep in a hard-hitting debate.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying your hair is like, beyond poofy today.\u201d\nBucky frowns, fighting the urge to run a hand through his hair self consciously. \u201cFuck off, it\u2019s always like this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\u201cNo problem\u2014you\u2019re just channeling some Edward Cullen today.\u201d\nBucky frowns again, his eyes narrowing. \u201cWho is that? Is that a singer?\u201d\nClint chuckles, so irrationally amused by moments like these when popular culture references are completely lost on Bucky and Steve. He repositions himself on the couch, slinging an arm over the back of it as he does a quick Google search on his phone, pulling up a picture of the mentioned fictional vampire.\nWhen the screen is turned toward him, Bucky scowls, clearly unimpressed. \u201cI don\u2019t look anything like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you guys use the same shampoo,\u201d Clint grins wildly, scanning through the rest of the pictures for more ammunition, \u201cSome kinda girly shit.\u201d\n\u201cI do not.\u201d Bucky is getting riled up now, and Clint just loves pushing his buttons.\n\u201cProbably strawberry-kiwi,\u201d he continues, \u201cOr no wait\u2014what\u2019s that stuff called\u2026?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s posture straightens, frown etched dangerously across his face as Clint continues listing as many girly scents as he can think of, including but not limited to vanilla bean, sweet pea, and fairy dust\u2014which Bucky is fairly certain isn\u2019t even a scent.\nThen Bucky stands up, determination blazing in his eyes, leaving Clint to watch, puzzled from the couch as Bucky wrenches the door to the bathroom open. The living room is immediately filled with the sound of running water and hot steam.\n\u201cSTEVE,\u201d Bucky says without hesitation, his entire body disappearing behind the door, \u201cThrow me my shampoo.\u201d\nThe shower door isn\u2019t tinted. Not even a little bit. So Steve\u2019s confused expression is completely visible through it (along with\u2026well everything else). \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cClint is being a dick.\u201d\nAnd it must be a feasible excuse, because Steve tilts his face under the stream of water before grabbing the bottle of shampoo from the hanging wrack in the shower, sliding the door open and sticking his arm out.\nBucky advances quickly, grabbing the bottle out of Steve\u2019s hand with a short \u201cThanks,\u201d before emerging back into the cool air of the living room and slamming the shampoo down on the table in front of Clint with gusto.\n\u201cFuck. You.\u201d He says with this sort of proud little grin because how did things escalate so quickly that he has to prove that he doesn\u2019t use women\u2019s soap?\nBut Clint isn\u2019t even really focusing on that whole thing anymore, he\u2019s more-so just sitting there, mouth slightly parted and eyes still fixed on the bathroom door.\n\u201cHe just barged in there?\u201d Tony is equally engrossed by the gossip once Clint weasels his way back to the common area.\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Rogers. He was just\u2014letting the flag fly?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cNo eye-covering? No discretion of any sort?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\nNatasha sighs from across the room, clearly over it before it has begun. \u201cThey grew up together, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she drones.\n\u201cYes and they\u2019re grown now. Big boys,\u201d Tony huffs because why does she have to keep stifling his fun? \u201cLet me have this one thing.\u201d\nBut Natasha doesn\u2019t even look up from her notes. \u201cI\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t anything they haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4.\nThis notion, the one where Bucky has seen all of Steve already and Steve has seen all of Bucky already, well it\u2019s made pretty clear a few nights later.\nBi-monthly trivia night is being held in Bucky\u2019s living room for some God-forsaken reason. Bucky protests and protests and protests until Steve pouts at him, his big blue puppy dog eyes proving to be too much to handle so it ends up being: \u201cGod damn it, fine.\u201d\nBut Bucky shuts himself away in his room because he doesn\u2019t exactly feel like camaraderie through trivia games, plus he knows jack shit about whatever the questions will be about, unless they\u2019re all pre-1950 (which he doubts).\nAnd he is correct. There\u2019s only a thin spattering of questions that extend past the 70\u2019s, and with every card that\u2019s drawn from the deck, Steve\u2019s sad little player piece begins to lag behind the others' on the game board. The only one who\u2019s doing worse than him is Thor. He hasn\u2019t moved at all. Not even one space. But he\u2019s still overwhelmed with joy, going on and on about comradeship and whatnot.\nThere\u2019s a question about Star Wars and Steve answers so vaguely that everyone feels bad for him and gives him a pity point. He\u2019ll take what he can get.\n\u201cHere\u2019s one for you, Steve,\u201d Natasha\u2014who has been slyly giving him answers from across the table all night\u2014says, staring down at the card in her hand. \u201cWhat 1930 war film won an Oscar for \u2018Best Picture\u2019?\u201d\nTony raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s oddly off-base. Is that even the question? Did you just make that up for him?\u201d\nBut Steve\u2019s mind is spinning like crazy because he knows this. He knows this. Visions of a damp movie theatre and stale popcorn flood towards him, Bucky to his left. They had seen this together. He had been so excited and felt so important because it kind of felt like he was seeing history in the making, his eyes taking in all he could from the Oscar-winner. \u201cShoot,\u201d Steve mutters now, brow furrowed in concentration. And then. \u201cWait, I bet Bucky knows.\u201d\n\u201cUm, excuse me, cheating,\u201d Tony states, pointing at Steve, who is already disappearing into the hallway. \u201cThat\u2019s textbook cheating.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fourteen spaces behind you,\u201d Natasha smiles, \u201cLet him have this one.\u201d\nSteve nearly runs down the hallway, Tony and Natasha\u2019s bickering fading not completely out of earshot as he reaches Bucky\u2019s closed door. And the adrenaline and sheer happiness from the possibility of actually answering one of these questions correctly briefly pushes away his manners, because then he\u2019s swinging Bucky\u2019s door open, his voice urgent, \u201cBuck! What\u2019s the name of that\u2014oh\u2026\u201d\nSteve stops, his hand still on the doorknob although his entire body is already in the doorway, a perfect front seat to see Bucky deep in the throes of jerking himself off: jeans pushed down around his ankles, bare chest, his face scrunched up in this look of pleasure as his hand works vigorously against himself.\nSteve\u2019s ears finally filter in the hitched little breaths and quiet noises Bucky\u2019s making. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo wait,\u201d Bucky breathes out hotly, his hand never leaving his body or even slowing, \u201cWait just gimme a\u2014fuck, so close.\u201d\nAnd then he\u2019s coming, strong and shameless onto his chest, his head thrown backward against the pillow and back arching as a long, wrecked moan escapes the back of his throat.\nHis worn breathing is all that fills the room, basking in his orgasm, until he slings an arm over his head, upper arm lazily covering his eyes. Then he inhales deeply, lets it out, and says: \u201cOkay\u2026what now?\u201d\nSteve jumps right back into his excitement. Like none of this just happened. Like he didn\u2019t just watch his best friend get off and come all over himself. \u201cRemember that one war movie we saw that won an Oscar?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s silent, then an unsure: \u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe saw it and then went over to Molly\u2019s for a burger because you had just gotten paid. And you ordered that gigantic chocolate milkshake and got a bad brain freeze.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Bucky sits up, a fond smile on his face as the metaphorical light bulb goes off in his memory. \u201cOh yeah!\u201d Then he realizes that he\u2019s still covered in the sticky white mess on his chest and he makes a face. \u201cJesus. Can you throw me that towel?\u201d\nSteve glances around the room, his eyes landing on the dark towel before throwing it over to his friend. Bucky catches it with one hand. \u201cWhat was the name of that movie?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s eyes unfocus for a second, narrowing in an attempt at recollection as he wipes the towel over his chest and stomach without looking. \u201cShit. What was it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomething about being on the front,\u201d Steve thinks out loud.\nAnd it must be all he needs to jog his memory, because then Bucky is almost shouting, \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front!\u201d like it\u2019s his job.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Steve grins so widely it almost hurts. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely it!\u201d\nAnd then he\u2019s disappearing from the doorway, leaving Bucky pretty much naked and still wiping the come off himself. \u201cSteve! Close my fucking door!\u201d he shouts after him.\nSteve reappears with a sheepish grin. \u201cSorry,\u201d and then closes the door behind him. \u201cI got it!\u201d his excitement follows him back into the living room where the rest are still waiting. \u201cIt\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front!\u201d\nHe takes the liberty to move his player piece up a space on the game board proudly, his pride swelling so much that he doesn\u2019t even notice how everyone is looking at him, mouths opened in disbelief\u2014and it\u2019s not because he finally got an answer right.\nTony and Clint are the first to move, each turning to Natasha in synchronized motions, giving her a look that screams \u2018still think we\u2019re crazy?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5.\nIt\u2019s a total accident that Steve and Bucky get stuck in a room that has a tiny sink, a kitchen, and one bed. It\u2019s a total accident that Tony and Clint may have caused and was actually not an accident at all but instead a full-fledged plan that actually worked pretty well and \u201cWell of course it did, I made it,\u201d says Tony.\nTo their credit, there is plenty of space for Bucky and Steve to move around. There\u2019s even a stocked fridge and some nice fluffy white sheets on the bed. And of course, the hidden security camera that\u2019s linked to the computer that Clint is now hovering over.\n\u201cYou\u2019re both disturbed. Really.\u201d Natasha says when she comes across them, arms crossed and a bothered frown written all over her face. \u201cThis is getting beyond creepy.\u201d\nTony hums quietly to himself, tapping his fingers on a screen that apparently adjusts the temperature in the room that they\u2019re observing. \u201cListen, we\u2019re not saying they\u2019re sleeping together\u2014\u201c\n\u201cBut they\u2019re sleeping together,\u201d Clint finishes, not taking his eyes off of the screen.\nAnd all Natasha can do is stand there, wondering aimlessly why again she decided to join this group in the first place. \u201cYou\u2019re children. You understand that, right?\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Tony muses, \u201cIt\u2019s true. Now let us play, Mommy.\u201d\nNatasha does an impressive job at staying calm\u2014not breaking bones today. \u201cWhat is this accomplishing?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re evidence-gathering.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. So say they are sleeping together. You get your evidence\u2014did I mention you\u2019re being beyond creepy?\u2014so what?\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019m right,\u201d Tony grins pompously until Clint clears his throat from across the room. \u201cWe\u2019re,\u201d Tony corrects. \u201cThen we\u2019re right. Sorry, dear.\u201d\nNatasha is about to fire off again, but the Clint is making excited noises and gesturing at Tony to come look quickly. Tony all but sprints to the other side of the room, his eyes falling onto the screen as Steve and Bucky\u2019s bodies move extraordinary close to each other.\n\u201cJARVIS, how long have they been in there?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes have been contained for just under 35 minutes, sir.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nClint snorts, \u201cHorny bastards, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nAll eyes are on the screen, on the two blissfully unaware men in the other room. Steve\u2019s hand reaches up and runs through Bucky\u2019s hair. Then again. Almost as if he\u2019s...\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Clint mutters as Steve fixes Bucky\u2019s hair once more and then backs away. \u201cFalse alarm.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t realize Natasha is still watching them from the other side of the room before she speaks again, damn near giving them a heart attack. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I guess I\u2019m still stuck on: you\u2019re waiting for them to have sex, and then you\u2019re going to watch them do it?\u201d\nTony looks at her like she\u2019s grown a second head, his voice dripping with horror, \u201cJesus, no. JARVIS is doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax, JARVIS, it\u2019ll be fine. Should be pretty intriguing. I\u2019m doing you a favor, really.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026how is that, sir?\u201d\n\nTony blinks, thrums his fingers against his thighs in a moment\u2019s thought, and then changes the subject quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Barton?\u201d\nClint, who now seems rather bored with the entire project, props his chin up with his hand, his eyes not once leaving the screen. \u201cTalking.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\nThe sudden boredom must transfer across the room, because Natasha is halfway down the hallway, muttering something about immaturity as she walks.\nTony and Clint stay and watch for another hour, only met with their subjects talking and throwing something around the room to stifle their own boredom. Tony quickly delegates the task over to JARVIS, who has no other option but to tentatively accept.\n\u201cUpdate,\u201d Tony will say throughout the night, elbow deep in the machinery of whatever project he\u2019s working on.\n\u201cNothing to report, sir.\u201d Is nine times out of ten what JARVIS will respond with. The last time he\u2019s asked, he replies with: \u201cCaptain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are sleeping, sir.\u201d\nIt peaks Tony\u2019s interest, his head popping out of a towering pile of metal like a prairie dog. \u201cPull it up.\u201d\nThe live feed of the bedroom is transferred to the large projector that takes up most of the north wall.\u00a0 Steve and Bucky\u2019s images are plastered there, squeezing themselves into the provided bed with just too little room that their backs are pressed against each other. Then Steve shifts, rolling over and slinging his arm around Bucky protectively.\nTony props an elbow up against a metal beam, his head tilting just slightly. \u201cWell how \u2018bout that.\u201d\nThe feed cuts out for a moment but then is right back up, just in time for Bucky to snuggle back against Steve\u2019s larger frame.\n\u201cJARVIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart is full.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I put Ms. Potts on the line?\u201d\n\nTony blinks, looks over the feed one more time, and then says contently, \u201cWould you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n+1.\nIt\u2019s during a group meeting when the hammer falls. Not Thor\u2019s hammer, in case there\u2019s any confusion\u2014but the metaphorical hammer that Clint and Tony have been waiting so desperately to drop.\nThey\u2019re all going over a recap of the week\u2019s events, villains they\u2019ve destroyed, malarkey they\u2019ve put a stop to, and their overall concerns.\n\u201cSpeaking of concerns,\u201d Tony interrupts, now in full-fledged Tony Stark mode, \u201cWhen are you two getting hitched?\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence. Lots of it. And then Bucky glances up for the first time, finally tuning into the conversation and suddenly realizing that he\u2019s being pointed to. His eyes shift cautiously between everyone until landing on Stark again. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cTony\u2026\u201d Natasha warns, but of course it falls on deaf ears.\n\u201cYou and the Cap,\u201d Tony continues, walking around the large oblong table they\u2019re all seated at. \u201cWhen\u2019s the date?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s brow knits in confusion, glancing over at Steve for any kind of assistance. \u201cThe date for what?\u201d\n\u201cWhen are you tying the knot,\u201d Clint offers, an amused smile playing across his lips, \u201cGetting married.\u201d\nThe room stills. Completely silent.\nSteve and Bucky look at each other with a solid mix of bewilderment and confusion between them.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Steve tries, adjusting the collar of his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t follow you.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Rogers,\u201d Clint muses, folding his arms across his chest and leaning back in his chair, \u201cIt\u2019s all good now.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s equal marriage in New York now, Cap,\u201d Tony clarifies, \u201cEqual opportunity for everyone to be miserable together forever.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s eyes are still on Steve, his scowl very apparent. Steve is the only one who can see past it and notice the slight quirk of silent thought swimming against all the blue.\nOn the other side of the table, Thor is simply beside himself with joy. \u201cWonderful! Truly a match made in the heavens.\u201d\nOpposite him, Bruce is glancing between the clearly-uncomfortable couple in question, and Tony. \u201cMaybe some explanation might move this along more productively.\u201d\n\u201cIf you insist,\u201d Tony says, immediately launching into his speech-giving voice, simultaneously making Bruce regret he said anything. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on us how chummy you two are. Touchy feely, even\u2026\u201d he begins, directing his words at Steve and Bucky now. \u201c\u2026how long you\u2019ve known each other, how remarkably undeterred you seem by what normal people might call uncomfortable situations, et cetera\u2014\u201d\nBucky\u2019s scowl intensifies, \u201cName one thing.\u201d And then he wishes he didn\u2019t say that because Tony ignites with examples.\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see\u2026intimate massaging, an incredible lack of a concept known as personal space, sharing each other\u2019s food\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNatasha and Clint share food all the time,\u201d Bucky disputes.\nTony nods. \u201cMm, they do. And they\u2019ve also had relations.\u201d\nNatasha rubs a hand over her face.\nAnd Steve just looks even more confused. \u201c\u2026relations?\u201d\nBut Bucky gets it 100%. \u201cHe\u2019s saying that since you and I share food, we\u2019re fucking.\u201d\nSteve blushes. It would be adorable, really, if it weren\u2019t for all the eyes on them.\nTony shrugs, nodding, \u201cWell\u2026yes. What I\u2019m also saying is that that\u2019s kind of in right now. There are entire industries all about male on male por--\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I think that\u2019s enough,\u201d Bruce says standing, and Steve and Bucky are glad for it. \u201cDoes anyone else have any concerns? No, not you, Tony, you\u2019ve had your turn.\u201d\nWhen nobody else speaks up, all probably still reeling from the previous conversation, Bruce nods and they all dismiss themselves from the table, going their separate ways.\nIt stays with Bucky\u2014what Tony said\u2014long after the conversation is over and he and Steve have called it quits for the night in favor of stretching out on the plush couch in Steve\u2019s living room. They\u2019re supposed to be relaxing, each taking up half of the L-shaped couch and their feet meeting at the intersection. Indeed, that is the near-nightly routine for them. But all Bucky can do is ruminate over all the ridiculous claims that Stark had thrown on the table not two hours ago\u2014and more importantly the not so ridiculous ones.\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: he doesn\u2019t need some cocky, high-techy billionaire telling him something he already knows. It\u2019s not like Bucky has no idea that he stares after Steve for much longer than necessary. It\u2019s not like Bucky has no idea that he\u2019s be goddamn head over heels for the man since before he can remember. What he does need is someone\u2014preferably still not Tony\u2014to inject him with a remarkable dose of confidence to actually act on this infatuation. Because regardless of how much time has passed and everything that has happened in between, they haven\u2019t done anything about it. And the pull between him and Steve has become so outrageously strong that he knows Steve feels it too.\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d\nBucky looks up, meets Steve\u2019s curious gaze from across the couch. \u201cWhat do I think about what?\u201d\n\u201cWhat Tony said.\u201d\nSteve can read his mind, Bucky\u2019s almost entirely sure. It\u2019s been this way since Brooklyn. He tilts his head, stares at his socks, does pretty much anything to hide the sudden curl of discomfort that blossoms in his chest. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\nSteve allows the beat of silence before speaking again. \u201cWell it\u2019s pretty great, though. Right? That men can be together now in some states.\u201d\nBucky shifts silently.\n\u201cIn this state.\u201d And Steve\u2019s voice is so purposeful, sharpened down to an obvious point that Bucky has to look at him.\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s uh\u2026\u201d\nSteve is patient\u2014waits for Bucky to finish his thought even though he knows it\u2019s not going to come because he knows Bucky and knows when Bucky is flustered about something. So he clears his throat quietly, wondering exactly how he got stuck being the one to move this conversation along when he\u2019s the one who still nervously calls sex \u2018fondue\u2019. Then he says: \u201cMarriage, even\u2026\u201d\nThe idea floats between them, nudging at Bucky\u2019s chest until Bucky sighs, letting his head rest back against the back of the couch, his words coming out hushed but important. \u201cSteve\u2026Jesus, you know how I feel about you\u2026\u201d\nSteve nods. An agreement. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t we\u2014I mean why haven\u2019t we done something about it?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s eyes are on him now, his discomfort translating flawlessly into his self-conscious movements. \u201cI don\u2019t--\u2026should we?\u201d\nHis arms have snaked their way around his own body, blocking his chest in a barricade from not only this conversation but probably a good portion of the thoughts that are swirling around in his brain.\nThen Steve\u2019s moving, picking himself up and then settling down next to Bucky when he draws his feet up. But it\u2019s not their normal in-your-left-pocket close. It\u2019s understated\u2014backed off just a little.\nSteve looks at his hands, then raises his eyes to meet Bucky\u2019s. \u201cI-\u2026I mean, I want to.\u201d He\u2019s just as uncomfortable, Bucky can tell by the way the corners of his mouth are turned just slightly downward without actually looking upset. Especially when he says, \u201cDo you want to?\u201d\nIt\u2019s ridiculous. He feels like he\u2019s twelve again, trying to summon up the courage to talk to that one dame with the pigtails from the candy store. But this is different. Because he\u2019s grown now\u2014not twelve. And this is Steve. Steve Steve. His Steve. But now, maybe after all these years he can actually, legitimately be his Steve. Bucky nods, swallowing down the lump in his throat that\u2019s forming just from the thought of finally being that much unbelievably closer to him.\nAn impossibly quick smile flits across Steve\u2019s face, only to be replaced by this look of broad, smoldering determination as his eyes flick down to Bucky\u2019s lips.\nAnd Bucky doesn\u2019t know what to do\u2014knows what he wants to do\u2014but god damn him if he doesn\u2019t feel that sudden pang of dull panic all the same. Steve\u2019s there. Right there. All glowing and faultless like he is\u2014like he\u2019s always been: a permanent fixture of perfection in Bucky\u2019s otherwise less-than stable existence.\nBut his heart is beating so fast. And he knows he\u2019s leaning in, closing that distance that\u2019s lingered between them for over ninety years, but\u2014\n\u201cJesus, why am I so fucking nervous,\u201d Bucky breathes out, his eyes trained on Steve\u2019s mouth, neither of them moving forward anymore. They\u2019re so close, like they\u2019ve always been. \u201cFu-\u201d\nSteve kisses him then, pressing forward with such determination even though he misses his mark by a few inches, the kiss landing firmly against the corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth. But it\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s sweet. And it reaches into Bucky\u2019s chest and gently unravels that curl of discomfort that\u2019s hovering there.\nBucky breathes out slowly. Tentatively. Then he presses so much closer and their lips are meeting straight on and it\u2019s got his entire body working the tension loose that\u2019s always hidden there, in the fraction of a space that was left to linger between the two of them.\nBucky reaches up, his hand cupping Steve\u2019s cheek: metal on skin and it\u2019s not enough so he adds his other hand and he\u2019s sitting there, gently holding Steve\u2019s face, his thumbs brushing over defined cheekbones as Steve hums against his lips.\nIt\u2019s so beautiful and heavenly and warm and long past due.\nSteve\u2019s hands find Bucky\u2019s waist, pulling him over and into his lap with a remarkable ease that leaves Bucky breathless. He worries for a moment about putting so much weight on Steve until his brain returns to normal functioning, reminding him that this is not the 40\u2019s. This is not Brooklyn. Steve could probably support the weight of a goddamn semi-truck if he had to now. It makes Bucky chuckle, tender and low and quiet against Steve\u2019s lips.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Steve hums, not breaking their kiss as he slides his hands up Bucky\u2019s back.\nBut Bucky just shakes his head, sinks into Steve like this is the only place he wants to be for the rest of his life, because it is. So they just sit there, tangled helplessly together like they\u2019ve always been, but more now. Closer now.\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for awkward touching and strong hands on new places and skin on skin.\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for \u201cI love you. I\u2019ve always loved you. I\u2019m always gonna love you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for Tony and Clint to engage in a manly fist bump because they were totally right, and for Natasha to roll her eyes but not be able to stop the endearing smile that pulls at her mouth because Steve and Bucky together are truly truly beautiful.\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for Bucky to freak out, his eyes scanning over the display in the jewelry store before he remembers that they have money now and nothing is too good for Steve because for Bucky, Steve is the epitome of good. Of all good things.\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for Steve to come home and freeze in his spot, heart welling up and key\u2019s clattering to the floor to find Bucky, dressed to the nines in his army service uniform and on one knee, smiling hopefully as Steve\u2019s eyes finally come to rest on the thin, silver ring in his hand. (And he swears to God he doesn\u2019t cry when Bucky slips the band on his finger--but everyone, including himself, knows he totally does.)\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for all of it. For all good things. So for now, they just wrap themselves in one another, and they kiss for the first time."
