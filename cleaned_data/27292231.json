    "text": "They\u2019re going to sing him to death.\nWen Qing has never had a high opinion of the great sects and their high-handed measures, but she thought better of the Lans. With a reputation and a motto for righteousness, surely she could expect more from them. Wei Wuxian thought better of them, or he would never have agreed to surrender the DafanWen to the GusuLan.\n\u201cThe Lans are incredibly stuffy, but they\u2019re good people,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay with them.\u201d\nBut perhaps Wei Wuxian had known all along. He\u2019s always acting like he was invincible. Wen Qing would not be surprised to find that he thought this was an acceptable price for just the chance to attend his sister\u2019s wedding, and to remain in YunmengJiang.\u00a0\nShe overheard the argument between Wei Wuxian and his brother\u2013how could she not? This is the agreement they reached. Wei Wuxian returns to Lotus Pier, and the DafanWen go to Gusu. The only reason why the Lans agreed to this was because of their Hanguang-jun. Wen Qing once had a high opinion of him too. She doesn\u2019t anymore.\nThe only thing the Lans want out of it is to purify Wei Wuxian of resentful energy. Wen Qing stands at the entrance of the Cloud Recesses when she learns this, and suddenly the austere, cold beauty of their ancestral home looks a lot more repressive. Any fool can see that Wei Wuxian is falling apart as he stands. The only thing that\u2019s keeping him together, sometimes literally, is his use of resentful energy. And the Lans want to purge all of it from him, because they cannot tolerate the use of resentful energy. The Lans are righteous, for a given definition of righteousness.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that the  only way,\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps.\nThere\u2019s a line of Lan elders watching their group with barely-hidden disdain. Wen Qing knows what they look like, this rag-tag group huddled behind Wei Wuxian like half-drowned rats. She sees them frown as they look over Wen Ning. She doesn\u2019t understand how they can look at Wen Yuan and find something unworthy, but that\u2019s their problem, not hers. They\u2019ve agreed to set aside a small valley in Gusu for their use. Wen Qing could get used to that, farming for the rest of her life with her family. It\u2019s a far cry from the Jin prison camps.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d says one of the elders.\u00a0\nWen Qing holds her breath and waits for Wei Wuxian to say no. She already can\u2019t believe the selflessness of this man, that he would put aside anything and everything for a group of people he\u2019s never met, who share a name with the Wens who burned Lotus Pier to the ground. All because she asked.\u00a0\nShe waits for Lan Wangji to step in, or for the kind-faced Lan Xichen to speak up. Neither of them do. Lan Wangji looks straight ahead, impassively. He doesn\u2019t so much as look at Wei Wuxian. Lan Xichen glances between Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji, and the elder, looking just a tad worried.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Wuxian bites out. \u201cOn two conditions.\u201d\nLan Xichen loses his worry. \u201cAssuming that the conditions are reasonable, of course.\u201d\n\u201cI want Wen Qing to be there.\u201d\nWen Qing\u2019s first reaction is surprise, but her second is understanding. Wei Wuxian has a secret to protect, one only she and Wen Ning know, and her little brother is not an option for so many reasons. All the Lans look at her, then, standing just a step behind Wei Wuxian and refusing to dignify any of them with a smile. It almost feels like she\u2019s back serving under Wen Ruohan again, in that moment. She\u2019s never been the sword or the one who holds it, but she\u2019s always been there to witness, she\u2019s always the one to clean up the mess these blood-minded men leave behind. The Lans look at her and see a doctor.\n\u201cThat is acceptable,\u201d Lan Xichen says, still smiling. \u201cAnd your second condition?\u201d\nThere\u2019s tension in every line of Wei Wuxian\u2019s body. He acts as if he\u2019s being hunted. But is he not being persecuted? Wen Qing wants to demand how they dare ask for his conditions to be  reasonable. She wants to shake Wei Wuxian by the shoulders and tell him not to do this. But she is, in the end, still a selfish, selfish, woman. She\u2019ll set aside morals to protect her family. She can\u2019t ask him to do this, but she\u2019ll stand aside and let him. What a terrible person she must be.\u00a0\n\u201cI want Hanguang-jun to be the one to perform it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, looking directly at Lan Xichen.\nLan Xichen\u2019s face crumples in relief, and Lan Wangji finally deigns to look at Wei Wuxian. His expression looks no different than it did before, but something about it seems intense in a way it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\nLan Wangji bows slightly. \u201cIt would be my honor,\u201d he says.\nLan Xichen looks relieved, like he\u2019s  grateful that his brother wants to do this. Wei Wuxian\u2019s face spasms. Likely he\u2019s in disbelief that Lan Wangji actually agreed.\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice is dripping with something that sounds like disdain and tastes like sarcasm. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d\u00a0\nHe whirls around and pushes through the crowd of Wens standing behind him. There\u2019s anger in every footstep, but if Wen Qing has ever seen a man entitled to his anger, it\u2019s Wei Wuxian, right here, right now. She doesn\u2019t try to stop him. The Wens follow behind him silently, down the winding path leading up to the Cloud Recesses. Wen Qing is the last, but she hesitates before she leaves.\n\u201cIs this really acceptable to the Lans?\u201d Wen Qing demands. \u201cWhat if he dies?\u201d\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t even bother to look at her. Lan Xichen looks nonplussed. The Lan elders look at her like they can\u2019t believe she dares speak to them, but she has to. She owes it to Wei Wuxian to try.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing purified of resentful energy,\u201d says one of the elders, stiffly, \u201cis the only service Wei Wuxian can provide the world.\u201d\n\u201cIt is better to die a righteous man than to live a dishonorable one,\u201d another intones.\u00a0\nWen Qing does not growl at him, does not shout or rage at these self-righteous men. She has spent too long in the court of Wen Ruohan to do that. Instead she inclines her head, just as stiffly. \u201cVery well,\u201d she snaps, and turns to leave.\nThe Lans are gracious hosts, Wen Qing will give them that. The DafanWen have almost free range of the Cloud Recesses during their move, not that they spend a lot of time there. There\u2019s not a lot that they have to move, only an allocation of resources. The Lans do not have much to spare, which is one of the reasons why they didn\u2019t take Wen prisoners to begin with. And although they make it clear that they don\u2019t have anything to give the Wens, it\u2019s not like Wen Qing was expecting supplies anyway. She and her family are still technically prisoners of war, despite their lack of involvement with the war.\u00a0\nTheir new home is a beautiful little valley about half an hour from the Cloud Recesses by foot, in the opposite direction down the mountain from Caiyi. It\u2019s nothing more than a collection of houses, a small village where the original occupants fled during the Wen occupation of the Cloud Recesses and later never returned, whether it was because they found somewhere better or they died during the war.\u00a0\nThe Wens settle in nicely, dividing the houses up amongst themselves and organizing the little supplies they have. The weather is just starting to warm, but Wen Qing is confident that come next winter, they\u2019ll have crops to trade in the market of Caiyi, in exchange for supplies they\u2019re currently lacking in, be it bolts of cloth for blankets and clothes, or things they can\u2019t make like pots and paper. Wen Ning has offered to hunt, but Wen Qing doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019ll actually be able to bring himself to kill an animal. He\u2019d probably apologize to target boards if he could.\u00a0\nWen Ning is also paraded before a whole host of Lan elders, but they can\u2019t find anything wrong with him other than the fact that he\u2019s supposed to be dead. Some still think that he should be put to rest, but they are gracious enough not to say it to his face. They quickly learn not to say it to Wen Qing\u2019s face, either. Ultimately, their biggest concern is Wei Wuxian. He\u2019s the reason Wen Ning is still walking, after all. He\u2019s a threat to the entire cultivation world, in their eyes.\nSurprisingly, Wen Qing finds herself getting along with the Lan medics. They\u2019re straightforward, and share her distaste for violence. She thinks it a shame she was not born into the Lan clan. She thinks she could\u2019ve fit in here.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are the chances that I actually die?\u201d Wei Wuxian says off-handedly one day, when Wen Qing picks up the argument with him again.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s been avoiding his precious Lan Zhan, which Wen Qing finally realized because Lan Wangji eventually came to  her  trying to find him. Wen Qing finds herself resenting Wei Wuxian, then, for the secrets he\u2019s forcing her to keep. She can\u2019t believe Lan Wangji thinks that Wei Wuxian  would want to talk to him, if he\u2019s not begging him to take it back, which is not exactly Wei Wuxian\u2019s style. Wen Qing is very much accustomed to backstabbing from living under Wen Ruohan\u2019s roof, but this is different. The Lans were supposed to be righteous, for one. Wei Wuxian has always spoken so highly of Lan Wangji, and so familiarly, but apparently their friendship was only extended to a Wei Wuxian who did not use demonic cultivation. Is he looking to explain himself to Wei Wuxian? Wen Qing can\u2019t say she\u2019s surprised that Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t want to hear it. She wouldn\u2019t either.\n\u201cAt least fifty percent,\u201d Wen Qing answers.\nWei Wuxian smiles, like that\u2019s good news. \u201cSee? That\u2019s not so bad! I\u2019ve beaten those odds before!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, Wei Wuxian!\u201d Wen Qing argues. \u201cAnd what will you do afterwards?\u201d\nWei Wuxian just shrugs. \u201cPick up demonic cultivation again,\u201d he says. \u201cI never said that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nWen Qing strides forward and blocks his path. Wei Wuxian is trying to rush past her again, in a hurry to get back to the little Wen village, mostly because it\u2019s farther away from Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji has taken to traveling down here every morning, though, so she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll last very long.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you really okay with this?\u201d Wen Qing demands. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been avoiding Lan Wangji.\u201d\nHe shrugs again. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think they would,\u201d he admits. His tone becomes drier than dust. \u201cAfter all, killing is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses.\u201d Wei Wuxian finally looks at her, pasting a bright smile on his face. \u201cSo I\u2019ve just got to live!\u201d\u00a0\nAs if it\u2019s that simple.\nStill, when Wen Qing is walking through the Cloud Recesses, she sometimes slows down while she passes Lan Wangji\u2019s house. Inside sits Hanguang-jun, sombre notes floating through the air from his guqin. He sits as straight and proper as ever, but there\u2019s the tiniest of frowns on his face, just the slight knitting of his brows, as he practices diligently for the day of the ritual.\nWen Qing clenches her fists, fantasizes of breaking his stupid guqin over his head, and walks away.\nLan Qiren is confused when Wei Wuxian first shows up. Wei Wuxian requested a week to help the DafanWen settle into their new home, and the Lan elders agreed, or so Lan Qiren heard. He knows that Wangji also wants the week to practice for the ritual. So he can\u2019t imagine what business Wei Wuxian has with him.\n\u201cMaster Lan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, more politely than Lan Qiren can ever remember him being. \u201cI have a proposal.\u201d\nIt would be rude to refuse him, so Lan Qiren wordlessly gestures for Wei Wuxian to sit across from him, and pours tea. If Wei Wuxian has come with another ridiculous theory of his, or if he\u2019s looking to weasel his way out of the ritual he agreed to, Lan Qiren is fully comfortable kicking him out. In all honesty, he was pleasantly surprised when Wei Wuxian agreed to the ritual. His opinion of the so-called Yiling Patriarch rose just a notch.\u00a0\n\u201cI have a\u2026very important explanation,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, once he has sat. \u201cAnd I ask that you not tell anyone.\u201d\nLan Qiren frowns. He is certainly no gossip, but he will not lie if asked. \u201cVery well.\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks assured, despite his grimace. He pulls out a document, and slides it over to Lan Qiren, who reads the title Theory on the Transfer of Golden Cores, author Wen Qing, before he notices Wei Wuxian gingerly rolling up his sleeve.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s absurdly easy to connect the dots.\u00a0\nLan Qiren grimaces as well, but he still presses two fingers to the exposed wrist. It takes only a moment to confirm before he pulls his hand away. Wei Wuxian lets his sleeve fall back down, and Lan Qiren is left a mixture of astonished and confused. Wei Wuxian has no golden core. He glances between the medical theory on the table in front of him and the demonic cultivator across from him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Is the only thing Lan Qiren can think of to say.\n\u201cI needed you to understand that I learned demonic cultivation because I had to, not because I wanted to,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers.\u00a0\nIt starts to make sense to Lan Qiren. Just a few years ago even this would not have excused Wei Wuxian, but now Lan Qiren has witnessed the great library of the Cloud Recesses burning, has seen his nephew get his leg broken and then be hauled off for the Wen \u201ctraining camp.\u201d He knows the damage dealt to Lotus Pier, and understands why Wei Wuxian would have felt the need to learn, once he no longer had a golden core.\u00a0\nStill. \u201cWhy did you not say you lost a golden core?\u201d Lan Qiren asks.\nWei Wuxian curls in defensively, just a little. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how his golden core got fixed.\u201d\nLan Qiren wants to ask who  he  is, and how  he can possibly not know that his golden core was replaced at the cost of Wei Wuxian\u2019s core. But it is not any of his business, even though he has a good guess as to who it is. And it is not his place to reveal this secret, so Lan Qiren takes this answer at face value. If nothing else, it raises his opinion of Wei Wuxian again.\u00a0\nInstead of asking any of this, Lan Qiren sets the golden core theory aside. \u201cWhat is your proposal?\u201d\nWei Wuxian straightens. \u201cI know that people look to me and think that they can try their hand at demonic cultivation. I thought if anyone could help me explain just how dangerous demonic cultivation can be, it would be you.\u201d\nThis\u2026is not something Lan Qiren is against. He is, in fact, an advocate against the use of demonic cultivation. He thinks he might find Wei Wuxian agreeable, now that he knows that Wei Wuxian feels the same way. In fact, he rather approves of Wei Wuxian\u2019s willingness to lose his only power left.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat would this entail?\u201d\nWei Wuxian spreads his hands and shrugs. \u201cI know a lot about demonic cultivation. I imagine you have a lot of things you want to say to demonic cultivators. I thought together we could explain why it\u2019s a bad idea, or at least teach people how to not hurt themselves or others.\u201d\nLan Qiren strokes his beard in thought. \u201cI am\u2026amendable.\u201d\nWei Wuxian finally smiles. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be able to finish before the end of the week?\u201d\nLan Qiren isn\u2019t sure why Wei Wuxian will not be able to help after the purification ritual, but then, he\u2019s not the demonic cultivator. \u201cPossibly,\u201d he says instead.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s face melts in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he says, and doesn\u2019t explain.\nJiang Cheng shows up on the fifth day.\nHe glowers the whole way while Wen Qing shows him to the room where Wei Wuxian is staying temporarily. Part of the unspoken agreement is that Wei Wuxian will return to normal cultivation. Wen Qing doesn\u2019t know how Wei Wuxian plans to explain his continued refusal, but a part of her suspects that Wei Wuxian is hoping to need no plan at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019re returning to Lotus Pier after the ritual,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding your teaching responsibilities for long enough.\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t put up a fight, and that\u2019s when Wen Qing  knows. But if he thinks that she\u2019ll let him go without a fight, he\u2019s dead wrong. Screw the Lans and their rituals; they\u2019re not taking Wei Wuxian from the world just yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this whole business over with,\u201d Jiang Cheng continues. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to agree to it for a bit back in the Burial Mounds.\u201d He looks pathetically relieved.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think the Lans would agree to it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jiang Cheng says uncomfortably. \u201cLucky for us they did, right?\u201d He looks at the wall. \u201cYou have to come to A-Li\u2019s wedding one way or another. We\u2019ve been planning that since we were kids.\u201d\nWei Wuxian swallows nothing. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cCan\u2019t miss it, even if she  is marrying the peacock.\u201d\nJiang Cheng doesn\u2019t look very close to joining in on their usual jokes. Wen Qing should probably stop spying on them now, but she still feels like something\u2019s about to go wrong.\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad you agreed,\u201d Jiang Cheng says abruptly. \u201cThis whole resentful energy business really hasn\u2019t been good for you. You\u2019ve been\u2026wasting away.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Wei Wuxian says tightly.\n\u201cNot in a\u2013\u201d  bad way, Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t say, because there\u2019s really no good way to waste away. He clears his throat needlessly. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he mutters. \u201cAt least you agreed.\u201d He hesitates before reaching out. \u201cDo you want me to be there?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, immediately and violently. He regrets his tone, if the way Jiang Cheng\u2019s face shutters closed is any indication. \u201cJiang Cheng, wait, I meant\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jiang Cheng says shortly. He stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you afterwards, Wei Wuxian.\u201d\nSect Leader Jiang strides out the doorway in an angry whirl of violet robes. Too soon, he vanishes up the mountain.\n \u201cFuck.\u201d Wei Wuxian buries his head in his hands. His shoulders shake.\nWen Qing decides it\u2019s high time she stops eavesdropping, and she starts to move away as well when Wei Wuxian speaks again.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, you know, Wen Qing.\u201d\nWen Qing stops and walks around the little cottage to sit down properly across from Wei Wuxian. She won\u2019t insult both of them by pretending she wasn\u2019t eavesdropping.\n\u201cI\u2019m wasting away,\u201d Wei Wuxian elaborates, once she sits down. \u201cMy body\u2019s been decaying ever since I got thrown into the Burial Mounds,\u201d he says bitterly.\nWen Qing can\u2019t deny it. She remembers how Wei Wuxian looked before she did the core transfer. And even back then, when he was crushed under the loss of his home and his adopted family, still injured by Madame Yu and the Xuanwu cave, he looked so much healthier than he does now. His complexion is pallid, his skin is unhealthily pale. He\u2019s too thin for a proper Head Disciple, and his eyes are constantly accentuated with bags. He drinks too much and smiles less.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Wen Qing says.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d\n And what about you?  Wen Qing thinks.  What about your happiness? \u201cWhat about the Lans?\u201d Wen Qing presses. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say killing is forbidden?\u201d\n\u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Wei Wuxian says abrasively. He crosses his arms in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s always exceptions. I\u2019m sure Zewu-jun didn\u2019t hesitate when escaping the Wens that were burning down his home.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still going to make Lan Wangji a murderer,\u201d Wen Qing says.\n\u201cHe  knows what he\u2019s doing!\u201d  Wei Wuxian stands suddenly, furiously. He\u2019s almost snarling at her. \u201cI mean, just  look  at me.\u201d He gestures at himself, disgusted. \u201cWhat does he  think is going to happen? My body\u2019s being held together by demonic cultivation and sheer willpower!\u201d\n\u201cYou asked him\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to agree!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries. He sinks back into his seat.  \u201cFuck. It\u2019s always been like this. I should\u2019ve known. I used to do the most ridiculous things to get his attention, and then he\u2019d\u2013like it\u2019s another game of chicken. He thinks he\u2019s calling my bluff. Fuck, I was supposed to go to Yanli\u2019s wedding.\u201d\nWei Wuxian buries his head in his hands again. His breath rattles in the air. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says again quietly, and nothing more.\nLan Qiren finds that he has grown far more tolerable of Wei Wuxian\u2019s presence in the past week. He finds that when Wei Wuxian is not interrupting his lectures, and actually listening to him, their interactions go a lot smoother. He also finds that when he himself listens to Wei Wuxian, now that his crazy theories are, in fact, reality, he can appreciate how incredibly fast Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind works. He knew back when Wei Wuxian was a guest disciple here that Wei Wuxian was a brilliant student who simply didn\u2019t apply himself, but now he knows that Wei Wuxian does apply himself\u2013to things he finds worthy of his attention.\nLan Qiren thought it would be a disaster, meeting with Wei Wuxian for several hours everyday, but three days in he finds that it has gone astonishingly well. His opinion of Wei Wuxian has changed rather dramatically in the past three days. But it isn\u2019t until he takes lunch with his eldest nephew on the third day that he begins to think past the purification ritual at the end of the week.\n\u201cI had not realized you were meeting with Wei Wuxian, Uncle,\u201d Lan Xichen says.\n\u201cHm.\u201d It is their tradition to meet before lunch once a week, but Lan Qiren put him off for after lunch in order to finish working with Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt was not my intent to keep you waiting.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I understand, Uncle,\u201d Xichen says. \u201cOnly, I thought that you and Young Master Wei\u2026did not get along.\u201d\n\u201cI did not think so either,\u201d Lan Qiren admits. \u201cHowever, we have been working on a manual warning of the dangers of demonic cultivation, and he insists that we must finish this week. He is\u2026tolerable.\u201d\u00a0\nPersonally, he thinks that Wei Wuxian's insistence on finishing before the end of the week is because after the ritual, Wei Wuxian plans on returning to Lotus Pier and never coming back. Lan Qiren's not yet willing to admit to himself that he\u2019s had more interesting discussions with Wei Wuxian than he has had with any Lan, and he\u2019ll perhaps miss them once Wei Wuxian is gone.\nXichen raises his eyebrows. \u201cYet you still find him to be abrasive and rude?\u201d\n\u201cHe is certainly not\u2026polite,\u201d Lan Qiren says. He previously found Wei Wuxian outrageous for his casual abandonment of cultivation, but of course that makes sense now. For the sake of honesty, he continues. \u201cI find him to be an upstanding young man, of righteous character. Surprisingly,\u201d he adds, for old times\u2019 sake.\u00a0\nHis nephew certainly looks surprised, but he recovers quickly. \u201cThat is\u2026quite fortunate,\u201d Xichen says, breaking into a relieved smile. \u201cDoes that mean you would be amenable to thinking of Wei Wuxian as a potential future nephew-in-law?\u201d\nLan Qiren feels a cold chill. \u201cYou\u2026?\u201d He is so not ready to talk about this with Xichen.\nFortunately, Xichen looks briefly panicked. \u201cNo, certainly not,\u201d Xichen says hastily.\n\u201cThen Wangji\u2026?\u201d Lan Qiren questions, and gets his confirmation when Xichen looks vaguely guilty. So Wangji has a crush on Wei Wuxian. That is\u2026not something Lan Qiren had been expecting. But he believes Xichen, which means he now has to consider Wei Wuxian as a potential future nephew-in-law.\u00a0\nTo his surprise, he finds the idea tolerable.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think Wei Wuxian would be agreeable?\u201d Xichen asks, with just a hint of desperation that tells Lan Qiren that Xichen has been trying to set them up for a while.\u00a0\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d Lan Qiren answers.\u00a0\nNowhere in the past three days of conversations has Wei Wuxian\u2019s  love life come up, and Lan Qiren hopes it never will. There is, however, the issue of Wei Wuxian\u2019s golden core. The other elders would never approve of Wangji marrying a non-cultivator, though of course they need not know of Wei Wuxian\u2019s loss. But Wangji ought to, if they are to marry.\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps they may discuss it after the ritual,\u201d Xichen suggests.\nLan Qiren strokes his beard. \u201cIndeed.\u201d\nIt takes Lan Qiren until the end of the week to unravel the final mystery. He is sitting across from Wei Wuxian again, as they survey the pile of notes and tentative manuscript that they\u2019ve pain-stakingly compiled over the past week, and he wonders  why me?\u00a0 \nWei Wuxian could have gone to any of the Lans. He could have even gone to Wen Qing, as the highly-praised doctor who already knew his secret. But more indicatively, Wei Wuxian could have gone to Lan Xichen or Lan Wangji, and instead he chose Lan Qiren, who he knew to dislike him. Why?\nWei Wuxian assembles their rough draft proudly. \u201cYou\u2019ll finish the rest?\u201d He says, flashing Lan Qiren an empty smile. He\u2019s been smiling less and less over the past week.\nLan Qiren supposes that Wei Wuxian\u2019s part is done, and he\u2019s likely eager to return to Lotus Pier. He still finds it a little impolite to simply leave Lan Qiren to do the rest of the work. But then again, this is more or less what Lan Qiren agreed to at the beginning.\u00a0\n\u201cAfter the ritual,\u201d Lan Qiren agrees, and catches a hint of a grimace on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face before it\u2019s wiped away by another empty smile. It is then that he puts it together, all of Wei Wuxian\u2019s grimaces and refusal to so much as say \u201critual.\u201d\nAll at once it is so obvious why Wei Wuxian chose to come to him: he trusted Lan Qiren to not care. Lan Qiren could not have been Wei Wuxian\u2019s top pick for \u201cLan to spill secret to.\u201d He could, however, reasonably be considered to be the Lan who dislikes him the most. If he were a lesser man, he might find a way to get Wei Wuxian out of the ritual. His demonic cultivation offers untold powers, ones that the Lans would have access to if Wei Wuxian does in fact become a member of the inner clan. Moreover, Lan Qiren has spent the last week reviewing just how toxic its use is, and how dangerous its effects can be for Wei Wuxian, especially since he does not have a golden core.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian rises to leave. The next time Lan Qiren planned on seeing him was after the ritual, but he finds he has something to say before Wei Wuxian leaves.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he calls.\nWei Wuxian stops at the entrance and turns around, looking almost hopeful for a moment.\nBecause if Lan Qiren did not care about Wei Wuxian, did not care about his health, what would the point of the ritual be? Lan Qiren is against the use of demonic cultivation because of its corruptive capabilities and its harm to the user, though in truth he thinks Wei Wuxian has the highest chance out of everyone of successfully turning it into a proper, safe method of cultivation.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian went to Lan Qiren trusting that his old teacher wouldn\u2019t care, but Lan Qiren finds that he  does.\u00a0 \nLan Qiren clears his throat. \u201cI believe you made a mistake in judging my character,\u201d he says stiffly, because that is as close as he can come to saying  I care. \u201cTherefore the ritual will proceed tomorrow.\u201d\nHe watches as Wei Wuxian looks first confused, and then his face settles into something blank. Wei Wuxian nods stiffly and leaves without a word. It is not quite the reaction Lan Qiren expected, but he imagines that it is quite the inner conflict for Wei Wuxian, who is doubtless eager to be rid of resentful energy, but also scared of living as a powerless person.\u00a0\nLan Qiren holds out hope that he can cultivate again, as his core was not destroyed but surgically removed. Before this week, he saw the ritual as good for the cultivation world in general. But now, he sees the purification ritual as really, truly, for Wei Wuxian\u2019s own health.\nWei Wuxian walks the winding path down the mountain back to the new Wen village on shaking legs. He refuses to cry, but a small part of him wants to. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s particularly close with Master Lan. Before this week, he would\u2019ve said that Lan Qiren disliked him the most out of all the Lans. But he thought something changed this week, or at least he assumed it did. Lan Qiren actually seemed to listen to him, and care about what Wei Wuxian had to say. Perhaps Wei Wuxian is the fool for thinking that meant something.\u00a0\n You made a mistake, he said, and clearly Wei Wuxian did. He hadn\u2019t quite hoped that this week would be enough to change Lan Qiren\u2019s mind about the evils of demonic cultivation\u2013it\u2019s all they\u2019ve talked about, after all\u2013but maybe he thought he could show that he had it under control. But of course, the Lans have already agreed to the purification ritual. They cannot possibly go back on their word.\nThe Cloud Recesses disappear from sight as Wei Wuxian treks further and further down the dirt path, until the view is entirely covered by trees. The next time Wei Wuxian will see it will be the morning of the purification ritual. He breathes in the heavy scent of pines and wishes, for the last time, that ritual could\u2019ve taken place in Lotus Pier, where the air smells of lotuses, spice, and home. He thinks he almost would not mind it, that way.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian made a mistake in thinking that Lan Qiren could possibly care about him, but he refuses to believe that the manual itself is a mistake. He doesn\u2019t want to leave a legacy of demonic cultivation behind him, and he trusts that Lan Qiren will finish it and hopefully mitigate some of the damage Wei Wuxian unwittingly caused by inventing demonic cultivation.\nWei Wuxian heads down the mountain for what is quite possibly his last evening, and wonders who will miss him once he\u2019s gone.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s avoiding me.\u201d\nLan Xichen stands over his little brother, who is sitting despondently in front of his guqin. This is Wangji\u2019s final practice before the actual ritual, though in truth Lan Xichen thinks that Wangji has perfected it for a while now. He hides a wince, though he cannot deny the fact that Wei Wuxian has been avoiding Wangji.\nA small part of him hopes that Wei Wuxian is avoiding Wangji for the same reason that Wangji blushes anytime Wei Wuxian\u2019s second request is mentioned: he has a crush.\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps he does not know what to say to you,\u201d Lan Xichen offers.\n\u201cHm.\u201d Wangji looks unconvinced. To be fair, Lan Xichen does not think he\u2019s ever seen Wei Wuxian at a loss for words. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is a good sign, is it not, that he agreed?\u201d Lan Xichen presses.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d worried, before this week, that Wei Wuxian had changed irrevocably. But apparently he is willing to give up resentful energy and return to regular cultivation, which can only be a good sign. Their uncle has also gone a complete 180 in his opinion of Wei Wuxian during their daily conversations. He even agreed to consider Wei Wuxian as Lan Wangji\u2019s future cultivation partner. Lan Xichen would go so far as to say that he approves. Of course, all this depends on what Wei Wuxian himself thinks of the matter, and Lan Xichen knows that Wei Wuxian is not someone to marry simply because of reputation or status, which would win Wangji almost any other person\u2019s hand in marriage.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Wangji agrees, looking pleased.\n\u201cAnd he requested you, specifically,\u201d Lan Xichen adds.\nThe tips of Wangji\u2019s ears flush red, though he must know what Lan Xichen is doing. In Lan Xichen\u2019s opinion, Wangji is truly the most logical choice to carry out the ritual. He does not know Wei Wuxian well enough to say whether that was his reasoning as well. He does, however, know Wangji very well, and knows that beyond duty, Wangji is truly honored to be chosen.\u00a0\n\u201cHe trusts you to conduct the ritual properly,\u201d Lan Xichen continues. \u201cHe trusts you to do it safely.\u201d\nWangji ducks his head, but he doesn\u2019t quite manage to hide the small smile blossoming on his face. \u201cMn,\u201d he agrees again, because that\u2019s the only logical conclusion to Wei Wuxian asking for him specifically.\nLan Xichen, in truth, is not wrong. But it is not until it is too late that he questions what, exactly, Wei Wuxian trusts his brother to do.\nAll of the Wens pitch in to offer Wei Wuxian the best they have to offer on the final night.\nNone of them like eating alone, so every evening they take their tables and chairs out of their little cottages and converge as one big family to eat dinner together. This night is no different, but there\u2019s an aura around Wei Wuxian that makes him seem far more alone than he really is. Wen Ning finally managed to hunt game, so they\u2019re eating meat for the first time in a long time.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is your last chance to back out,\u201d Wen Qing says quietly to Wei Wuxian, who picks despondently at his food but doesn\u2019t eat.\n\u201cI\u2019m not backing out,\u201d Wei Wuxian says tiredly.\u00a0\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold it against you,\u201d Wen Qing says, for what feels like the thousandth time. \u201cNone of us would. You\u2019ve already done so much for us. You don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\n\u201cI already agreed,\u201d Wei Wuxian says unhappily.\u00a0\n\u201cBut what about your family?\u201d Wen Qing presses. \u201cSect Leader Jiang, and Lady Jiang\u2026and Lan Wangji. Have you thought about them?\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries. It sounds like it was supposed to be derisive, but his voice cracks in the middle. He lays his head down on the table, pushing his plate of food away. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says again, almost wistfully. \u201cHe won\u2019t miss me.\u201d\nDon\u2019t you wish he would, though? Wen Qing thinks, but doesn\u2019t say. \u201cWill you not ask for someone else to conduct the ritual, at least?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says crossly, refusing to look at her. \u201cI already asked for Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cBut you thought he wouldn\u2019t agree,\u201d Wen Qing counters. She doesn\u2019t bring up Wei Wuxian\u2019s rather obvious infatuation with Lan Wangji, because she feels it\u2019s rather unfair to both of them.\n\u201cBut if it has to be someone, I\u2019d rather it be him,\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts. He blinks afterwards, looking surprised that he said it out loud.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Wen Qing demands.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and doesn\u2019t explain. He avoids talking to Wen Qing and returns to his dinner, where he avoids the meat and eats the potatoes. \u201cAt least I know he\u2019ll do it right,\u201d Wei Wuxian says eventually.\n\u201cSo would Zewu-jun,\u201d Wen Qing points out. \u201cWould you not rather it be anyone but your\u2026friend?\u2019\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Wei Wuxian admits. \u201cBut.\u201d He looks away from her again, continues pretending his food is far more interesting, when he can barely stand to shovel it down. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just. I trust Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cTo do what?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries. He gives up on eating, and buries his face in his hands. Wen Qing gives up on restraining herself, and gives Wei Wuxian the hug no one else will give him tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s just Lan Zhan,\u201d he says into his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if it\u2019s Lan Zhan. It\u2019s alright.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not alright. Wei Wuxian continues shaking, and Wen Qing continues hugging him, and it\u2019s the very furthest thing from alright.\nWhen the day arrives, Wen Qing and Wei Wuxian both hike up the mountain to the Cloud Recesses. Wei Wuxian spends almost an hour saying goodbye to everyone; first Wen Ning, then all the aunts and uncles, then Granny, then A-Yuan, the Wen Ning again, then A-Yuan again, until Wen Qing finally forces him to leave. She feels like a monster for doing it, but they agreed to meet a certain time. Wei Wuxian is the one who said he wouldn\u2019t chicken out.\nThey make their way to the discipline pavilion, and Wei Wuxian chatters the whole way there, pointing to every place they pass and naming another memory to Wen Qing. She can\u2019t help but notice that many of the memories involve Lan Wangji. But she doesn\u2019t point that out to him, or tell him to shut up like she usually would. Wen Qing feels like it\u2019s the least she can do for him, listen to his rambling on the way. It\u2019s only thirty minutes, after all. She\u2019ll have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life.\u00a0\nLan Xichen and Lan Wangji are waiting for them in the discipline pavilion, and Wei Wuxian only hesitates for the barest moments before skipping over the stones.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we were both here, right Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian says with false cheer.\u00a0\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t bother to respond, and Wen Qing is unreasonably mad at him for it. He could at least dignify Wei Wuxian with a response. She stands on the edge of the pavilion, across from Lan Xichen. Making friends with the Lan healers has its advantages, namely, having access to the best medicine the Lans have to offer. If there\u2019s any place Wei Wuxian will recover, it\u2019ll be the Cloud Recesses. The Jiangs are still rebuilding their medic wing.\u00a0\nInstead of responding, Lan Wangji just sits down on the stones, placing his guqin in position. Again, Wei Wuxian wavers, but he plonks himself down in front of Lan Wangji. He crosses his legs and settles into a vaguely meditative pose.\u00a0\nLan Xichen notices his hesitation. \u201cIt is brave of you to go through with this, Young Master Wei,\u201d he says, still smiling, smiling,  smiling.\u00a0 \nWen Qing wants to punch him in his pretty face. She\u2019s always disdained violence, but she always thought that good men with power didn\u2019t exist. Then she met Wei Wuxian, who is undeniably powerful and inexhaustibly good. She understands now why people follow these men to the ends of the world. Why her own brother would.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease, Zewu-jun,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. His eyes are closed, and his smile is tight. \u201cLet\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d\nAnd Lan Wangji begins to play.\nIn the end, it\u2019s rather peaceful. Lan Wangji is an expert musician, and the piece he plays could be considered calming, beautiful even, under different circumstances. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t make a sound. His smile fades as the resentful energy comes pouring out of him. The shadows hiss, quietly, as they rise over the columns of the pavilion. But Lan Wangji is an expert cultivator, as is Lan Xichen. They handle it with ease, dispersing and banishing it.\nWen Qing\u2019s fingers begin to twitch when she sees Wei Wuxian\u2019s old wounds begin to open up, but she forces herself to wait for the Lan brothers to finish. In the end, it only takes three minutes.\nLan Wangji finishes his song, and finally looks up from his guqin. Lan Xichen began to look worried about halfway through, but they both look worried when Wei Wuxian slumps over onto the stones.\nIt\u2019s only been three minutes, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s body has already begun to decay. He lands with his forehead down, his wild mane of black hair spilling over his head. Wen Qing immediately starts not-quite running, but Lan Wangji gets there faster.\nHe sets his guqin aside, golden eyes wide. \u201cWei Ying!\u201d Within a moment, he\u2019s gathered Wei Wuxian in his arms like a friend, like a lover.\nLan Wangji pulls Wei Wuxian upright, lets his head roll back onto his shoulder, and doesn\u2019t let go even when blood begins to soak his white robes.\n\u201cLet go,\u201d Wen Qing snaps. She stands next to the two of them, but she knows she can\u2019t actually make Lan Wangji let go, so she doesn\u2019t try. But she needs to act soon to save Wei Wuxian.\nLan Wangji glares at her, like it\u2019s  her fault, and doesn\u2019t let go. He instead shifts his grip, and tries to pass Wei Wuxian spiritual energy. His fingers move to Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, and Wen Qing reaches out and grabs his arm, ignoring the rudeness, and tries to yank his hand away from Wei Wuxian. She fails, and then it\u2019s too late. His golden eyes widen in shock, then narrow in anger when he looks at Wen Qing.\n\u201cWhere is his\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Wen Qing interrupts harshly. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that you\u2013you weren\u2019t supposed to  touch  him. Who gave you the right?\u201d But she still can\u2019t pull him off, so she just directs the full force of her anger on him, dares him to respond.\nMostly he just looks confused, as well as angry. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cLady Wen,\u201d says Lan Xichen, stepping forwards from his side of the pavilion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What went wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing went wrong,\u201d Wen Qing spits. \u201cIt did exactly what you wanted it to do. You got what you wanted. Now can you please give him to me so I can make sure he doesn\u2019t  die.\u201d She\u2019s so tired of being polite to these damn Lans.\nLan Wangji only pulls Wei Wuxian closer. \u201cWhat did you do to Wei Ying,\u201d he demands. His glare is ice-cold, but Wen Qing refuses to be cowed by him.\n\u201cWhat did  I  do?\u201d Wen Qing retorts, though she knows exactly what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cWhat did  you do! Now give him here, Hanguang-jun!\u201d\n\u201cL\u2019n Zh\u2019n,\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly, stirring in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms.\nLan Wangji looks down, his golden eyes horrified. His face is less than an inch from Wei Wuxian. \u201cWei  Ying.\u201d \n\u201cL\u2019t\u2026me go,\u201d Wei Wuxian manages, before his silver eyes close again.\u00a0\nFinally, Lan Wangji lays him gently down on the cold stones, though he doesn\u2019t stop glaring at Wen Qing when she gets close. She ignores him, though, and reaches for her medical supplies.\n\u201cWhy does he not have a golden core?\u201d Lan Wangji asks quietly.\nWen Qing doesn\u2019t stop her work, or even spare him a glance. \u201cThat\u2019s not my secret to tell, Hanguang-jun.\u201d\u00a0\nThis was at least part of the reason Wei Wuxian asked for her to be here: to protect his secret. And she failed, because Lan Wangji swept him up in his arms, like his personal savior. She doesn\u2019t let it show, but she hates herself, a little, for failing to do this one thing for Wei Wuxian. Now all she can do is pray that Lan Wangji will deign to keep a secret.\u00a0\nShe still doesn\u2019t understand why Lan Wangji rushed forwards to pull Wei Wuxian into his arms. But Wen Qing is beginning to think that when Lan Wangji said it would be his honor, he meant something other than the empty gesture of formality that Wen Qing took it to be.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, it did what it was supposed to do?\u201d Lan Xichen asks. He stands behind his brother, looking oh-so worried.\u00a0\n\u201cYou purged him of resentful energy,\u201d Wen Qing says flatly. \u201cHe\u2019s free.\u201d She could go on, and explain how Wei Wuxian\u2019s body is a spider web of wounds and scars, or how he never fully healed from his time in the Burial Mounds\u2013how could he? She could explain the wounds that are opening up again now, but she doesn\u2019t owe them anything.\u00a0\n\u201cBut\u2026he\u2019s dying,\u201d Lan Xichen persists. He turns accusing eyes on her. \u201cYou would make my brother a murderer?\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Wen Qing hisses. She pulls off Wei Wuxian\u2019s outer robes right there in the discipline pavilion, no doubt eschewing generations of decency. \u201c\u2018It is better to die a righteous man to live a dishonorable one,\u2019\u201d she quotes viciously.\u00a0\nHe looks horrified. \u201cWe did not think you meant that seriously,\u201d Lan Xichen protests.\n\u201cWhat did you think I was, joking?\u201d Wen Qing snaps. She tries desperately to focus. \u201cPlease do not disturb me, Zewu-jun,\u201d she says stiffly. \u201cI am trying to save his life.\u201d She can only hope that he\u2019ll live to see his sister get married.\nThe Lans listen to her, somehow. But they don\u2019t go away. They just watch Wen Qing lose herself in her work, as she tries desperately to preserve the life of this beautiful, broken man, while his body gives up on itself and tries to decay, before he can even turn twenty-one.\nLan Wangji continues kneeling on Wei Wuxian\u2019s other side. His hands are clenched in his lap, and he\u2019s looking down. But Wen Qing notices, despite her urgent fixation on Wei Wuxian, when Lan Wangji bows his head, and silently begins to weep.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s dying?\u201d\nLan Qiren usually has the presence of mind to be polite in front of a lady. This is not a usual circumstance, and Wen Qing doesn\u2019t even look fazed.\nWei Wuxian is lying in his hospital bed, pale as death. His hair is washed and combed, for once, and he\u2019s in his red under robes underneath the bedsheets. He hasn\u2019t woken up since he asked Lan Zhan to let him go. His torso is covered in bandages, and his neck is covered in old, faded bruises that never got a chance to heal before Wei Wuxian started using resentful energy in place of a golden core. Chenqing lies by his bedside.\u00a0\nWen Qing has just finished changing his bandages. She straightens at Lan Qiren\u2019s accusing words. Wen Qing has done all she can, for now. It is now up to Wei Wuxian to wake up. So she sets her shoulders and faces the four men pacing or glowering or staring in disbelief.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not  dying,\u201d  Wen Qing placates. She never thought she would need to assure them that Wei Wuxian  won\u2019t die. \u201cHe\u2019s currently in an unstable condition.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lan Qiren bites out.\nWen Qing resists the urge to throw up her hands. \u201cWhat do you mean, why? He\u2019s been completely drained of resentful energy. He has to recover from that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the odds?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. The young Jiang leader is pacing back and forth at the foot of Wei Wuxian\u2019s bed, twisting Zidian over and over. Now he stops and turns to face Wen Qing, an urgent question on his lips.\n\u201cAbout fifty-fifty,\u201d Wen Qing says. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly stubborn. I\u2019d give him higher odds.\u201d Her higher odds  are fifty-fifty, but there\u2019s no need for them to know that.\n\u201cWhy is that something he must recover from?\u201d Lan Qiren demands.\u00a0\nWen Qing does throw up her hands at this. \u201cBecause! He\u2019s drained of resentful energy!\u201d\n\u201cYou thought we would knowingly  kill him,\u201d Lan Xichen repeats, distressed.\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you would!\u201d Wen Qing says. They seem to be doing little else but repeat themselves.\u00a0\n\u201cHe should be healing,\u201d Lan Qiren insists.\u00a0\nThe three men circle in closer, crowding Wen Qing, demanding answers. She refuses to be cowed but she  is scared, to tell the truth. She tightens her grip on her acupuncture needles defensively.\u00a0\n\u201cKilling is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses,\u201d Lan Xichen says, for the hundredth time.\n\u201cDid he know this would happen?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands.\n\u201cHe asked me to perform the ritual,\u201d a fourth voice interrupts from behind them. The three men break off from glaring at Wen Qing to face Lan Wangji, who stands still on the other side of the room. He looks absolutely miserable. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nWen Qing is beginning to think Wei Wuxian\u2019s infatuation with Lan Wangji might not have been so one-sided. Which is why she can\u2019t understand why Lan Wangji agreed to go through with the ritual.\n\u201cHe\u2026didn\u2019t think you\u2019d agree,\u201d Wen Qing offers lamely.\n\u201cBut I did,\u201d Lan Wangji says flatly. \u201cWhy did he not change his mind, afterwards?\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted it to be you,\u201d Wen Qing says. \u201cHe trusted you to do it right.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s words are short and clipped. He doesn\u2019t clench his fists, but he was crying not that long ago.\u00a0\nWen Qing doesn\u2019t dare voice her own theory on why Wei Wuxian wanted it to be him. She might not be right, for one, and if she is, it\u2019s not her place to say.\n\u201cI am at a loss,\u201d Lan Qiren professes. \u201cWhy did he learn demonic cultivation, if not because he\u2013\u201d He breaks off suddenly, and glances quickly at Jiang Cheng before looking away.\u00a0\nLan Xichen and Lan Wangji, who both have learned of Wei Wuxian\u2019s core, also studiously look everywhere but Jiang Cheng. The Lans really are terrible liars.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps testily. He glances uneasily from person to person, afraid of what they know that he doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d Wen Qing evades.\n\u201cHow did the ritual inflict all these wounds?\u201d Lan Qiren points a furious finger at Wei Wuxian\u2019s body.\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t he want me to know?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands harshly. He fists are clenched, and when he takes a step forward, Zidian flashes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t inflict the wounds,\u201d Wen Qing says crossly. \u201cThey just never healed properly. Did you think the Burial Mounds were conducive to his health?\u201d\n\u201cThe Burial Mounds?\u201d Lan Xichen echoes.\n\u201cHe never talked about that,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. \u201cHe never\u2013he doesn\u2019t talk about  anything.\u201d \n\u201cWen Chao bragged that he threw Wei Ying in the Burial Mounds,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI believed him to be lying.\u201d His eyes dart over to Wei Wuxian, and they narrow in rage as he makes a connection. \u201cIf these are old wounds, who strangled him?\u201d\u00a0\nAll five of them look over at Wei Wuxian to see the splotchy green and black bruises choking Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat. Wen Qing is the only to see Jiang Cheng look away guiltily.\u00a0\n\u201cHe did not tell us about the Burial Mounds,\u201d Lan Xichen says, distressed. \u201cIf we had known\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI said he might die!\u201d Wen Qing says again. \u201cNeither of you responded! I assumed you were fine with it.\u201d\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t think he  would die!\u201d Lan Xichen\u2019s voice cracks.\n\u201cYou were  looking at him!\u201d Wen Qing exclaims. \u201cHe was falling apart! I\u2019m honestly astonished he hadn\u2019t fallen apart already! He was a walking miracle!\u201d\n\u201cLady Wen,\u201d Lan Qiren interrupts. \u201cYou are a brilliant doctor, and you were already familiar with Wei Wuxian\u2019s situation. Young Master Wei is the only demonic cultivator and a genius in his own right. Have you considered that what was obvious to both of you simply was not obvious to us?\u201d\nWen Qing presses her lips into a thin line.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lan Xichen, for the thirtieth time this day. \u201cYou lacked the information to arrive at the proper conclusion, but Young Master Wei\u2026he  knew us. How could he believe\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I understand,\u201d Wen Qing begins, warily, \u201call of you have expressed your disdain for demonic cultivation quite vocally. Hanguang-jun in particular has been asking him to submit to a cleansing for a year now.\u201d\nLan Xichen once again looks horrified. \u201cMy brother has been trying to  court him,\u201d he snaps.\n\u201cYour brother was trying to  what,\u201d Jiang Cheng says flatly.\n\u201cWei Wuxian certainly had no idea,\u201d Wen Qing says.\nThey look at Lan Wangji, who looks too distraught to look embarrassed. Wen Qing doesn\u2019t know him well, but she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say he looks devastated. He starts crying again at Wen Qing\u2019s words, but nobody bothers to point it out.\n\u201cBut you told him to go through with the ritual!\u201d Wen Qing defends, pointing a needle at Lan Qiren.\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man says, \u201cbecause it was clear that resentful energy was having a negative impact on his body, and despite\u2026other losses I still believed it to be in his own interests to be rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you think he was so unwilling to go through with it?\u201d Wen Qing demands.\nLan Qiren frowns. \u201cDemonic cultivation is a great source of power\u2013\u201d\n\u201cPower?\u201d Jiang Cheng interrupts incredulously. \u201cWhen has my brother ever held on to power?\u201d\nLan Qiren closes his mouth with a snap. He stands there bristling while Jiang Cheng fumes and growls, and Lan Wangji\u2019s cheeks grow damp.\u00a0\n\u201cIt seems,\u201d Lan Xichen says, as delicately as possible in this situation, \u201cthere have been a few grave misunderstandings.\u201d\nThe infirmary is dark when Lan Wangji enters.\nWei Wuxian is still lying in bed, though Wen Qing has been rotating his position to maintain blood flow. He looks so peaceful while he sleeps. Lan Wangji is anything but. He carries a soup that was made by the cooks of GusuLan, which he places by Wei Ying\u2019s bedside. Then he sinks to his knees next to the bed, and reaches for one of Wei Ying\u2019s deathly cold hands.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he begins, then stops before his voice breaks. He squeezes Wei Ying\u2019s hand, gently, and finds that all the words he wants to say are for a Wei Ying who is awake and able to hear him. \u201cWei  Ying,\u201d he says again. He cannot refrain himself from looking Wei Ying up and down, although he knows the bruises on his neck have faded by now. \u201cPlease wake up,\u201d he begs. \u201cPlease, Wei Ying.\u201d\nHe could not stomach it if  let me go were Wei Ying\u2019s last words to him, spoken while Wei Ying fades on the stones of the discipline pavilion.\u00a0\nLan Wangji looks up when he hears the door slide open, but does not let go of Wei Ying\u2019s hand even when Wen Qing glances at their joined hands and raises an eyebrow. He finds he does have something to ask Wen Qing, as she understood Wei Ying the best this past week.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought he trusted me,\u201d Lan Wangji says to the wall. He looked away when Wen Qing pulled Wei Ying\u2019s robes open in order to change the bandages.\nThe sound of rustling cloth stops briefly. \u201cHe did,\u201d Wen Qing says, before resuming.\u00a0\n\u201cNot in the way I thought he did,\u201d Lan Wangji says, trying to keep his voice steady and the bitterness out.\n\u201cPerhaps he did,\u201d Wen Qing says cautiously. She goes to turn Wei Ying over, and Lan Wangji is forced to let go of his hand. \u201cHe cared a great deal about your opinion, Hanguang-jun.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Lan Wangji does not know how to express how much he wants to believe her and how much he fears that she is wrong. In the end, he says nothing at all until she leaves.\nWen Qing closes the door behind her with her foot, balancing too many medical supplies in her arms. Lan Wangji scoots closer to Wei Ying and takes his hand once more.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji begins once more.\u00a0 \u201cI will not apologize until you wake up.\u201d He tells himself that Wen Qing\u2019s words are true, and continues. \u201cI will court you properly, when you wake up. So please.\u201d His voice finally cracks on the last word, but he must finish. \u201cWake up, Wei Ying. Please. It cannot end like this.  Please.\u201d\u00a0 \nLan Wangji bends over slightly and presses a kiss to the back of Wei Ying\u2019s hand. This is as far as he dares to go, when he knows he does not deserve to take such liberties. Finally he stands up, and settles back into the demeanor befitting Hanguang-jun. His eyes betray no emotion, and not a hair is out of place. But his heart is beating rabbit-quick in his chest, and his fingers itch to hold Wei Ying once more.\n\u201cI will wait,\u201d he vows. \u201cFor however long it takes, I will wait for you, Wei Ying.\u201d\nThe infirmary is light when Jiang Cheng enters.\u00a0\nWen Qing is carrying a pitcher of water, and Wen Ning is juggling all of her medical supplies in his arms, trying not to trip and fall. Jiang Cheng is carrying a bowl of lotus and pork rib soup. He went down to Caiyi to find the necessary ingredients and made it himself in the kitchens of the Cloud Recesses. Jiang Cheng places the soup next to Wei Wuxian\u2019s bedside, and imagines that somewhere in Wei Wuxian\u2019s unconscious mind, he\u2019s smelling the soup and perking up.\nJiang Cheng stands silently across from the two Wens, and is unable to help a brief flash of utter loathing\u2013at them, and at himself\u2013for a moment. \u201cHe was never going to tell me, was he.\u201d\nThe two Wens glance at each other, before Wen Ning shakes his head.\n\u201cWe promised not to tell you,\u201d Wen Ning says timidly. He spreads his sister\u2019s medical supplies out across the table.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng tries not to clench his fists. \u201cRight,\u201d he says tightly. He remembers Wei Wuxian saying the same thing two days ago when he told him how relieved he was that Wei Wuxian agreed to the ritual, and hates everything a little more.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Wuxian, you fucking idiot,\u201d Jiang Cheng spits. \u201cHow  could  you. Why didn\u2019t you  ask. Why\u2013\u201d\nHe knows why.\n\u201cYanli\u2019s wedding is in three weeks,\u201d Jiang Cheng says abruptly. He doesn\u2019t want to tell her what has happened so close to her wedding day, but there\u2019s no way he can keep it a secret from her. \u201cFuck, what am I going to tell A-Li? What was he going to tell A-Li?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Wen Qing answers helplessly.\n\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d Jiang Cheng says bitterly. \u201cOf course.\u201d He gives in and clenches his fists. \u201cWei  Wuxian. When you wake up, you\u2019re gonna have a lot to answer for. You better wake up,\u201d he adds threateningly. \u201cYou better.\u201d\n You promised you\u2019d stay by my side forever, Jiang Cheng thinks. Was his brother really planning on breaking that promise? But no, Wei Wuxian has to survive. He always has. Mother used to say that Wei Wuxian was like a cockroach, and Wei Wuxian used to joke that it was because no matter what Yu Ziyuan did to get rid of him, he kept coming back. Jiang Cheng never found it funny, and he sure isn\u2019t laughing now.\u00a0\n\u201cHe must have thought I was fucking stupid, not realizing this whole time,\u201d Jiang Cheng says viciously.\u00a0\nHe can see it in his mind\u2019s eye: Wei Wuxian laughing at him behind his back,  poor Jiang Cheng, poor stupid Jiang Cheng, making a fool of himself, pretending he can be sect leader, going up the mountain like the fucking  idiot  that he is\u2013 \n\u201cY-you shouldn\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Wen Ning says.\n\u201cHe managed to fool the entire world,\u201d Wen Qing points out reasonably.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jiang Cheng barks out a laugh. \u201cI still should\u2019ve known better.\u201d\nHe should\u2019ve known better, but he was too wrapped up in his own insecurities and petty jealousies to see the truth in front of him, just like his mother. He couldn\u2019t understand how Wei Wuxian could just give up cultivation, like he hadn\u2019t spent all his life working for his golden core. Like Jiang Cheng hadn\u2019t spent all his life trying to match Wei Wuxian in power. Including the past year, because he finally, finally was just as powerful as Wei Wuxian and he didn\u2019t even know it, and now that he does, how can he possibly appreciate it? Jiang Cheng can\u2019t remember the countless times he\u2019s stood in the shadows over the years, burning with resentment, and wondered,  what would I do for his power? \nNot this.\nNot this.\nThe infirmary is just starting to get dark when Wen Qing enters. She doesn\u2019t have medical supplies this time, or any bandages to change. She checks over Wei Wuxian\u2019s wounds out of habit, but she has nothing left to do but wait and hope Wei Wuxian pulls through.\nSo she sits by his bedside and waits.\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d she says eventually. She\u2019s not in the habit of talking to her patients while they\u2019re asleep, but Wei Wuxian was always dying to be the exception to every rule. \u201cNobody is happy.\u201d\n It\u2019s the only way everyone is happy, he\u2019s said, but not a single goddamn person is happy. She thinks of Lan Wangji keeping vigil by his bedside, of Lan Xichen pale and horrified by his brother\u2019s side, of Lan Qiren red-faced and spluttering, and Jiang Cheng, pacing furiously in front of the bed. Jiang Yanli cried when she heard. Not even Jin Zixuan could comfort her. She wasn\u2019t present for the passive-aggressive fight the three Lans had with the Lan elders, but she can tell who won from the way the elders can\u2019t help but glare at her when they see her or Wen Ning pass by.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNo one is happy,\u201d Wen Qing says again. \u201cWei Wuxian, you fucking idiot. No one is happy, so just\u2013wake up, Wuxian. Wake up.\u201d\nWei Wuxian remains unmoving in his bed, and Wen Qing stands. His chest rises slightly, the only visual indication that he still lives. His hair is spread out behind him on the pillow, and he is, for once, perfectly still. He looks so peaceful, and Wen Qing can\u2019t help but worry that he\u2019s  too peaceful.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll miss you, Wuxian,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Your Lan Zhan will cry. Do you want to be responsible for that?\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Wen Qing says finally, and leaves.\nThe infirmary is dark once more when a pair of silver eyes finally open.\nThe infirmary is dark once more when a pair of silver eyes finally open. His first coherent thought is that he\u2019s desperately thirsty, so he fumbles around in the dark until his hand connects with a pitcher of water. Clumsily, he brings it to his face and chugs the entire glass, splashing water on his face unintentionally.\n\u00a0The movement alerts someone in the room, who hurriedly lights a candle.\n\u201cMaster Wei? Master Wei? Are you awake?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the hesitant voice of Wen Ning, who appointed himself as night-watch, since he doesn\u2019t sleep anyway. His gray face looms out of the darkness, illuminated by the soft orange glow of the candle.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian opens his mouth to say  yes,  or maybe  water, but all that comes out is a croak. He clears his throat painfully and tries again. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cO-of course, you need water!\u201d Wen Ning bustles around, propping Wei Wuxian up on his pillows and fetching another pitcher of water.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian downs the second pitcher just as greedily as the first, but a heavy sensation in his stomach warns him not to drink too much so soon.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he tries again, voice still raspy.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to talk, Master Wei,\u201d Wen Ning advises.\u00a0\nRight on cue, Wei Wuxian\u2019s head swims. He has so many questions on the tip of his tongue, but his tongue isn\u2019t cooperating with him at this moment. How long has it been? Has he missed Yanli\u2019s wedding?\nSilver eyes close again.\n\u201cMaster Wei?  Master Wei? Oh dear, they\u2019re going to kill me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you  sure he woke up?\u201d\nJiang Cheng, Lan Wangji, and Wen Qing stand around Wei Wuxian\u2019s hospital bed, staring intently at Wei Wuxian, who is sleeping peacefully in the same position he was yesterday.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wen Ning says firmly. \u201cHe tried to talk, and he drank two pitchers of water.\u201d\nJiang Cheng begins pacing, to no one\u2019s surprise, while Lan Wangji continues staring at Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, as if he could will him awake through sheer power of will.\nAs if by magic, Wei Wuxian chooses that moment to stir. Jiang Cheng whirls around immediately, but Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t waking up. His brows are furrowed, but his eyes aren\u2019t opening. Gone is the peaceful look that marked his week-long rest. Now his limbs begin to stir, but there\u2019s nothing comforting about it. Then his arms begin to thrash, and Wen Qing\u2019s eyes widen in alarm. Wei Wuxian seems to be caught in the throes of a nightmare, fending off invisible enemies. But the only person within reach is Wei Wuxian himself.\n\u201cStop him!\u201d Wen Qing barks out.\nJiang Cheng and Lan Wangji immediately rush to his side, each grabbing an arm. Wen Qing and Wen Ning move to the foot of the bed when Wei Wuxian begins to kick. The blankets are jerked to the side before they manage to pin his legs down.\n\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands, voice tense.\n\u201cNightmare,\u201d Wen Qing answers shortly. That\u2019s her best guess, at least. It should be a good sign. Wei Wuxian is finally moving on from his deep, undisturbed sleep, and entering a dream somewhere in his subconscious. Returning to the nightmares they all pretended not to hear during his week with the Wens. Returning to reality.\u00a0\n\u201cNnnn\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian slurs, not quite opening his mouth. His eyes are still firmly shut, but his mind is seeing something they can only imagine.\n\u201cHold his other leg,\u201d Wen Qing tells her brother, and rises from her position on the floor to rummage around her supplies.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s lips crack open as Wen Ning grasps his other ankle with his other hand. \u201cNnn no,\u201d  he manages. His voice is rough from disuse. He yanks his arm from Jiang Cheng\u2019s grip, and elbows his brother in the face.  \u201cAh!\u201d The sound escapes his lips as his sudden arm movement pulls the bandages on his chest.\n\u201cWei Wuxian, you idiot,\u201d Wen Qing and Jiang Cheng can\u2019t help saying, even though Wei Wuxian is clearly fast asleep. They exchange a surprised look, but he grabs Wei Wuxian\u2019 arm again without pause. She returns to the bed with silk cloth that she twists into a makeshift rope.\u00a0\n \u201cNo,\u201d\u00a0 Wei Wuxian cries again, weakly, and Wen Qing wants to yell at him to shut up. Can\u2019t he see the faces Jiang Cheng and Lan Wangji are making? \u201cL\u2019t\u2026me go,\u201d he says, an echo of his final words before collapsing.\u00a0\nWen Qing can\u2019t quite tell if he\u2019s demanding or begging, but Lan Wangji lets go of his arm all the same, as if burned. Jiang Cheng\u2019s face goes through a grimace with about five extra layers added on, and Lan Wangji\u2019s face is frozen in an open expression of\u2026 something. Wen Qing would say either terror or horror, but either way, hearing Wei Wuxian\u2019s last words again can\u2019t be good for either of them.\nAs soon as Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm is free it flails wildly through the air, before it flies to his own face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d Wen Qing snaps out.\nLan Wangji hurriedly reaches for Wei Wuxian\u2019s forearm again, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s nails are already raking down his own cheek, almost hard enough to draw blood. Wen Qing hurries to the head of the bed, and wraps the first length of silk cloth around Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist.\u00a0\n\u201cLet me go let mego  letmego,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats over and over, still struggling against them even as it hurts himself. It\u2019s somewhere between pitiful and worrying. Perhaps both. Lan Wangji looks more and more strained everytime Wei Ying pleads with him to let him go, but he keeps his grip steady as Wen Qing ties a quick but sturdy knot and then loops the other end of the silk cloth around the bed frame.\nA minute later, Wen Qing finishes tying the last knot, and all four of them lean back and try to relax. It doesn\u2019t work, of course. They may not be panting, but they\u2019re still incredibly tense. All of them exchange a stricken look as Wei Wuxian\u2019s half-mumbled words die down into whimpers, even as he continues thrashing against his new restraints.\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the untouchable Yiling Patriarch that he\u2019s supposed to be. But Wei Wuxian only gained power for every time he was beaten. And he never claimed to be all-powerful.\n\u201cHe\u2019s waking up,\u201d Wen Qing offers uselessly.\u00a0\nIt should be a good sign. It really should be. But all this tells them, or rather reminds them, is that Wei Wuxian waking up is only the beginning of the battle.\u00a0\nThe infirmary is light when Wei Wuxian opens his eyes again.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a smell wafting towards his nose, triggering an instinctive response in his subconscious brain that has his eyelids cracking open. He breathes in deeply, ignoring the aching pain from the two stab wounds and more healing on his chest. Ah, there it is: the familiar, heart-warming scent of lotus and pork rib soup.\nThe door opens, and sunlight streams into the infirmary room. There\u2019s a small table next to Wei Wuxian\u2019s bed that\u2019s currently holding a pitcher of water and the bowl of soup. A shelf on the other side of the room is stuffed full of medical supplies. Wei Wuxian recognizes a roll of bandages sitting on the second shelf as the same bandages currently wrapped around his torso.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a loud crash as the figure standing in the doorway drops the tray they were carrying.  \u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Zhan looks too bright for Wei Wuxian\u2019s poor eyes.\nWei Wuxian struggles to sit up, ignoring the pull on his bandages, which is when he notices the silk ropes binding him to the bed. He resists the urge to pull, knowing that won\u2019t help, while his brain immediately runs through the worst-case scenarios. But by the time he looks up, Lan Zhan is already by his side, fingers tugging apart the knots around the bed frame.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says again, almost desperately.\nWei Wuxian struggles to sit up again, and Lan Zhan hovers around him anxiously, propping his pillows upright while Wei Wuxian flexes his wrists and tries to breathe through the pains and compression of his chest.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian croaks, while he reaches for the pitcher of water. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s clearly in a Gusu infirmary; the sparse aesthetics of the room tell him so. And he recognizes Wen Qing\u2019s medical equipment on the shelves, so she must be taking care of him. This much, he expected. But he didn\u2019t really expect Lan Zhan to be visiting his hospital room. Lan Zhan seemed like one of those people who sees no point in visiting patients while they\u2019re unconscious.\u00a0\nLan Zhan can\u2019t seem to find the words to answer him. He stares at Wei Wuxian with big, tragic eyes, his hands trembling as he offers Wei Wuxian the lotus and pork rib soup. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, yet again. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pauses in the middle of inhaling the soup. \u201cHuh?\u201d He says intelligently.\u00a0\n\u201cI am so  sorry,\u201d Lan Zhan repeats, and his eyes plead with Wei Wuxian to understand even though Wei Wuxian very much doesn\u2019t, and he has no idea what Lan Zhan\u2019s face is doing.\n\u201cSorry for what?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks blankly.\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t planned on thinking so soon, but he casts his mind back anyway, searching for his last memory. Dimly, he recalls Wen Ning lighting a candle and offering him water. Before that, the last thing he remembers is the ritual itself. He recalls three minutes of what felt like a torture and a release, followed by him sliding to the ground as a thousand pains blossomed on his body, waiting for darkness to take him. But Lan Zhan wouldn\u2019t let him, he remembers that. Lan Zhan pulled him upright, threatening to crush him in his fragile state. Blurrily, Wei Wuxian remembers telling Lan Zhan to put him down, before peace came and the darkness finally claimed him.\u00a0\nBut Wei Wuxian is awake again. His eyes gradually adjust to the bright light, and Wei Wuxian almost regrets being let go by the darkness. He wouldn\u2019t mind the peace so much.\nIs this what Lan Zhan is apologizing for, then? Hindering Wen Qing\u2019s medical efforts?\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, strained. \u201cYou nearly  died. I almost.\u201d He doesn\u2019t continue, but Wei Wuxian thinks he knows where that sentence was going.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees. He\u2019s a little confused, but mostly content to continue stuffing his face with this wonderful soup.\nBut Lan Zhan\u2019s face  twists, as if he\u2019s the one in pain. \u201cHow could you think I would willingly do so?\u201d\nHis tone indicates that there\u2019s a right and wrong answer to that question, but Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know what that \u201cright\u201d answer is. His experiences in the lectures has taught him that he most often has a correct answer that others simply do not wish to hear.\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Wei Wuxian points out, now thoroughly confused. Sure, he asked Lan Zhan to do it as part of his two conditions, but Lan Zhan could\u2019ve said no. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t need it to be him, he just preferred it that way.\nLan Zhan looks deeply dissatisfied with this answer. \u201cNot willingly,\u201d he insists. \u201cI did not know.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no easy way to say  Wei Ying, you almost died in my arms, and I will never forget it for as long as I live, so Lan Wangji stops there.\n Didn\u2019t know what? Wei Wuxian thinks crabbily, but he\u2019s way too tired to muster up the energy to be mad. \u201cI forgive you for not knowing, Lan Zhan,\u201d he begins, a hint of amusement in his voice.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan snaps. The word bursts out of him, and Lan Zhan presses his lips into a thin line, looking furious.\u00a0\nAnd really. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s done now to make Lan Zhan angry with him. All the same, he doesn\u2019t like Lan Zhan looking at him like this, so his mind scrambles, trying to think of what Lan Zhan could possibly be mad at him about.\u00a0\nAh. \u201cMy golden core was really none of your business,\u201d Wei Wuxian begins again. He\u2019d be angry on a normal day, but he can barely spare the strength to talk. \u201cAnd I have to insist that you don\u2019t tell Jiang Cheng\u2013\u201d\n\u201cJiang Wanyin knows,\u201d Lan Zhan interrupts. He still looks upset. \u201cWhat was your plan, Wei Ying?\u201d\nHis plan? Wei Wuxian stares blankly at him again.\u00a0\n\u201cYou promised to attend Lady Jiang\u2019s wedding,\u201d Lan Zhan reminds him, and does everybody know about that now? \u201cYou were supposed to train the Jiang junior disciples. Did you intend to abandon your responsibilities?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not  abandon so much as I was forced to,\u201d Wei Wuxian says crossly. \u201cYou Lans are the ones who said there was no other way you would take in the DafanWen. What does it matter to you w\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it  matter?\u201d \nOh no, now Lan Zhan looks livid. His golden eyes are narrowed slits.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean,\u201d Wei Wuxian splutters, unsure of where he went wrong, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2013uh\u2013\u201d\n\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d a voice says archly from the entrance. \u201cI thought you were going to apologize.\u201d\nWen Qing strides in. Her needles disappear in a flourish up her sleeves, and she throws a look at Lan Zhan while she steps over the mess he left from the tray he dropped.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian holds up his wrists, still with silk pulled tight around them, and raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou were thrashing in your sleep,\u201d Wen Qing says by way of explanation.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian suspects he might\u2019ve done something a little more dangerous than thrashing, but he doesn\u2019t ask. He pulls apart the ties and turns to Lan Zhan, whose furious face has faded to a look of contrition.\u00a0\n\u201cI meant to apologize,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cWei Ying. I am sorry.\u201d\n\u201cForgiven,\u201d Wei Wuxian says promptly. He discards the pieces of silk on the blanket and picks up his bowl of soup again.\u00a0\n\u201cWei  Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan cries.\n\u201cDo you even know what he\u2019s apologizing for?\u201d Wen Qing asks, rolling her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be so rash, Wei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why I  wouldn\u2019t  forgive him,\u201d Wei Wuxian says honestly.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s more of an idiot than you are,\u201d a familiar growly voice says from the entrance. Jiang Cheng steps over the spilled soup on the floor, his words belied by how relieved he looks. \u201cWhich takes an enormous amount of effort. Wei Wuxian. You  idiot.\u201d \nJiang Cheng marches up to Wei Wuxian\u2019s bedside, and Wei Wuxian swallows a mouthful of soup nervously. Jiang Cheng knows. He looks down at the Yunmeng soup and up at Jiang Cheng. \u201cThanks for the soup, Jiang Cheng,\u201d he offers hopefully. Jiang Cheng  knows. \n\u201cSure,\u201d Jiang Cheng says shortly. His demeanor gives no ground. \u201cWere you.\u201d He reels himself in for a moment, then gives up. \u201cWERE YOU EVER GOING TO TELL ME, YOU ASSHOLE!\u201d\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d Wen Qing snaps. \u201cThis is an infirmary.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian admits.\n\u201cASSHOLE!\u201d Jiang Cheng shouts again, his fists clenched. With Zidian on his finger, he literally sparkles with anger. Wei Wuxian thinks it\u2019s  adorable.\u00a0 \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop shouting, I\u2019m going to kick you out,\u201d Wen Qing warns.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng takes a deep breath and turns to Wen Qing, looking ready to start shouting at her. Wen Qing raises an eyebrow, and he thinks better of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sic A-Li on you,\u201d Jiang Cheng warns, and Wei Wuxian winces. \u201cHer wedding\u2019s in a week and she keeps on  crying.  You  asshole.\u201d \n\u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian manages, eyes weepy. \u201cI love you too, little brother.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I FUCKING NOTICED!\u201d Jiang Cheng makes an aborted motion, like he thought he could actually throw Wei Wuxian\u2019s golden core back at him. \u201cIf you ever try something similar again, I\u2019ll\u2013I\u2019ll disown you!\u201d\n\u201cSo if I try to risk my life for you again, you\u2019ll kick me out of the sect?\u201d Wei Wuxian checks, unable to stop himself from sounding amused.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Cheng says firmly. He points a finger at Wei Wuxian threateningly. \u201cSo\u2013don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Wei Wuxian manages. He sets the now empty bowl of soup back on the small table and leans forward to start untying the restraints around his ankles.\u00a0\nLan Zhan intervenes when he moves to stand up. \u201cIt is not safe.\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t refrain from rolling his eyes. Lan Zhan seems to think all of his life choices aren\u2019t safe, although to be fair, most of them aren\u2019t. \u201cIf I stay any longer in this bed I\u2019m going to go crazy. I\u2019m not dying, am I, Wen Qing?\u201d\nLan Zhan glances back at Wen Qing, who scowls at both of them. \u201cNo. Wei Wuxian does need to start moving,\u201d she says. \u201cBut.  Slowly.  Absolutely  nothing strenuous.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wei Wuxian says cheerfully, carefully bringing his legs over the side of the bed. He stands on trembling legs, and Lan Zhan is immediately there, holding him steady. \u201cI don\u2019t need help walking, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says, exasperated. Honestly. It\u2019s like Lan Zhan thinks he can\u2019t do anything by himself. He pulls away, missing Lan Zhan\u2019s stricken expression.\n\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d Wen Qing says, before the idiot can overthink it too much. \u201cWould you mind accompanying Wei Wuxian on his walk?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cNo need to make it sound like I\u2019m going to trip and fall on my face.\u201d\n\u201cYou will,\u201d Jiang Cheng says helpfully.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cDoctor\u2019s orders,\u201d Wen Qing intervenes again, before Wei Wuxian can glare at Lan Wangji and scare him away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles, and allows Lan Wangji to walk him out the door and then presumably wherever he wishes to go in the Cloud Recesses.\n\u201cThis is going to go terribly,\u201d Jiang Cheng predicts, mere seconds after they\u2019re gone.\n\u201cYou were the one who demanded he court your brother properly,\u201d Wen Qing reminds him.\nJiang Cheng scowls. \u201cHow was I supposed to realize that Hanguang-jun was  that bad  at it. I thought the Lans were big into romance. They have a bunch of rules on how to properly court someone, he should\u2019ve gone to  me, I\u2019m his sect leader and his broth\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wen Qing interrupts tiredly. She\u2019s already heard this spiel many, many times. \u201cI know.\u201d\nWei Wuxian bursts back into the healer\u2019s room only a few minutes later. He\u2019s panting, stumbling, and looks dead on his feet, but also very much panicked.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng jumps to his feet and manhandles him until he\u2019s sitting on the edge of the bed. Wen Qing is ready with a cool compress.\u00a0\n\u201cI told you not to run,\u201d Wen Qing snaps.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps out. \u201cBut it was urgent. I had to ditch my chaperone.\u201d\nJiang Cheng and Wen Qing share a glance behind Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, neither willing to explain to Wei Wuxian that they\u2019ve been trying to set him up on a date.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely dying,\u201d Wei Wuxian asserts. \u201cWen Qing, you were wrong, I\u2019ve got to be dying.\u201d\nJiang Cheng resists the urge to scream out loud. He stands up and brings Wei Wuxian the pitcher of water waiting by his bed.  \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cLan Zhan is being too nice to me!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries, after he\u2019s chugged the entire pitcher. He winces slightly as his chest expands and contracts rapidly, stretching the bandages Wen Qing has so painstakingly wrapped him in. \u201cI\u2019ve broken, like, twenty rules and he just keeps  looking at me, like I\u2019m on my deathbed! That\u2019s the only explanation!\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying!\u201d Lan Zhan appears in the doorway, looking terribly worried. He has a hand on either side of the entrance, as if that\u2019s the only way to stop himself from scooping Wei Wuxian up in his arms. \u201cIt is not safe to run\u2013\u201d\nWei Wuxian hides behind Jiang Cheng, who flails indignantly. \u201cSee?!\u201d His voice edges on shrill.\n\u201cWei Wuxian, stop hiding behind your brother. Lan Wangji, you said you would tell him.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s ears flush.\u00a0\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d Wei Wuxian demands faintly. \u201cI am dying, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? Wen Qing, you should\u2019ve just  told me\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to court you, idiot!\u201d Jiang Cheng barks. He looks like he wants to shove Wei Wuxian away, but still holds some courtesy for his injured brother.\u00a0\n \u201cCourt  me?\u201d Wei Wuxian pauses, and all three of them can almost  see his brain conjuring up the worst explanations. \u201cBut how does that work if I\u2019m dying?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dying!\u201d Jiang Cheng explodes. He removes himself from his position as Wei Wuxian\u2019s meat shield and stands to the side, glaring at both of them. \u201cYou better not be!\u201d\n\u201cBut I joked about shaving off Lan Qiren\u2019s beard and he didn\u2019t even tell me off!\u201d Wei Wuxian insists.\u00a0\nThe  he in question looks like he\u2019s one emotion away from shutting down. Wen Qing doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever experienced more than two emotions at a time, and right now he looks worried, confused, embarrassed, amused, horrified, mortified, and also head over heels in love with Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cHe would deserve it,\u201d Jiang Cheng retorts.\nWei Wuxian gapes. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cHe told you to get fucked!\u201d\n\u201cHe did  not,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, baffled. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cLan Qiren!\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian manages. \u201cI\u2019m going insane.\u201d\nJiang Cheng scowls. \u201cNot those words exactly, idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know that\u2019s how your stupid little peabrain interpreted it.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Wei Wuxian admits. \u201cBut! If I\u2019m dying\u2013\u201d\n\u201cFor the last time, you\u2019re not dying,\u201d Wen Qing interrupts crossly. \u201cLan Wangji is trying to court you because he wants to marry you.\u201d\nNow Lan Zhan looks a bit like he\u2019s dying himself.\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, sounding put on, \u201che\u2019s been in love with you for at least a year.\u201d\n\u201cMarried?!\u201d Wei Wuxian squeaks. \u201cTo Lan Zhan?!\u201d His cheeks are pink, and his silver eyes widen with the air of a man who has just had a world-changing epiphany. \u201cOh.  Oh. Wait. Wait!\u201d He turns to Lan Zhan, who is swaying in the doorframe. His smile could melt glaciers. \u201cLan Zhan! I love you too!\u201d\nLan Zhan faints.\nWen Qing is the one to walk Wei Wuxian to Lan Qiren\u2019s private study the next day, mostly because it\u2019s either her or Jiang Cheng, and Jiang Cheng is even more incapable of being gentle than her.\nThe study is deep within the center of the Cloud Recesses, and almost every Lan elder they pass takes the time to glare at Wen Qing. She ignores them, but Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t hesitate to give all of them his best sneer, one that wouldn\u2019t look out of place on Madame Yu.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian is walking far better today, but still, no one trusts him to walk by himself, not after yesterday\u2019s excursion. They\u2019ve just finished lunch, which was plain rice for Wei Wuxian, since Wen Qing has banned him from anything but the simplest of foods until he recovers. Wei Wuxian made one crack about all Lans being on medical restrictions, but complied a little suspiciously easily.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJiang Cheng slides open the door to the study, and then closes it behind them. The midday sun filters in from the windows, casting a patterned yellow light on the floor. Inside, the three Lans sit around a low table. They have a steaming pot of tea prepared, seemingly unaware that nobody but the Lans like Gusu teas. It takes them a minute to go through the proper greetings and to get settled around the table.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian can\u2019t sit properly, as his legs were dislocated just a week ago, and Jiang Cheng and Wen Qing have to shift to accommodate him. He sprawls awkwardly on his mat while they fold their legs underneath them and reach for their teas.\n\u201cI owe you an apology, Young Master Wei,\u201d Lan Xichen begins. He sits in the middle, with his uncle and brother on either side, one of which is studiously avoiding Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze while the other stares intently without blinking. \u201cI let my assumptions get the better of me. We did not realize that dying was a possibility.\u201d\nWen Qing\u2019s lips thin in displeasure. \u201cI said, \u2018What if he\u2013\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe question indicated speculation\u2013\u201d Lan Xichen cries.\n\u201cCan we not argue about this again?\u201d Jiang Cheng interrupts. They\u2019ve had every possible argument about ten times in the past week while they were waiting for Wei Wuxian to wake up.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lan Xichen says, inclining his head. \u201cI digress. I am sorry, Young Master Wei.\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks uncomfortable. \u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d he protests weakly.\u00a0\nBut Lan Xichen still looks distressed. \u201cYou thought we would knowingly kill you,\u201d he says. It\u2019s something he\u2019s said many times in the past week, but never to Wei Wuxian directly.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Wuxian hedges, but there\u2019s really no putting it nicely. \u201cI\u2019ve been corrected?\u201d\nLan Qiren clears his throat, an unfortunate echo of the last time he tried to express emotions in Wei Wuxian\u2019s direction. \u201cI confess I misjudged your character,\u201d he says stiffly.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian eyes him.  Therefore the ritual will proceed echoes in his head. He\u2019s not sure how Lan Qiren plans on explaining that, but all the Lans seem insistent that they had no idea that the purification ritual had a more than 50% chance of leading to Wei Wuxian\u2019s death.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought the ritual would be beneficial for your health,\u201d Lan Qiren continues.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shrugs. \u201cConsidering I survived,\u201d he says, ignoring the way everyone winces, \u201cI guess it was.\u201d\n\u201cYou still demanded it before you were worried about his health,\u201d Jiang Cheng points out bluntly.\u00a0\nThe whole purification ritual would\u2019ve never happened if the Lan elders hadn\u2019t jumped on the chance to rid the world of the Yiling Patriarch. One could argue that the Lans were bound by their own rules to protect the DafanWen, but that didn\u2019t stop them from putting stipulations on their generosity.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think that they would\u2019ve cared, do you?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\n\u201cKilling is forbidden in th\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, we know,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, interrupting Lan Xichen.\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says at the same time. \u201cI figured you were making an exception.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not break the rules for one person,\u201d Lan Qiren snaps.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wen Qing says archly. \u201cOnly when it suits you.\u201d\nThe six sit around the table and fume.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan speaks up finally. He has not looked away from Wei Wuxian once during this entire conversation. He stares intently, but he looks remorseful. \u201cWe are sorry.\u201d\nWei Wuxian sighs. \u201cI know, Lan Zhan.\u201d He offers all three of them a sun-bright smile. It\u2019s belied by the fact that his legs are sprawled crookedly in front of him, as they would start to shake if he tried to sit on them. \u201cI know.\u201d\nBy the time a week has rolled around, Wei Wuxian is walking almost entirely without pain. Lan Zhan still insists on \u201cchaperoning\u201d him everywhere, and Wei Wuxian certainly is not complaining. He sits next to Wei Wuxian in the enormous banquet table of the Jins. Vermillion Hall is almost too bright to look at, decked out as it is with enough gold to feed ten villages for a year, and a feast that could do the same. Wei Wuxian will say what he wants about the Jins\u2019 decadent lifestyle, but he doesn\u2019t mind his sister getting treated to this level of luxury on her wedding day.\nLan Zhan has assigned himself the role of Wei Wuxian\u2019s personal nurse, which means he\u2019s watching every dish that gets placed in front of Wei Wuxian with a critical eye, and keeping any and all alcohol out of his reach. Wei Wuxian still rolls his eyes when he notices Lan Zhan doing this, but doesn\u2019t protest. Wen Qing made it very clear that he was banned from drinking alcohol for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\nOn the first day of feasting, they each sat with their respective sects. Wei Wuxian sat next to Jiang Cheng, ignoring the glares that Jins threw in his direction. Jiang Cheng didn\u2019t hesitate to glare back, though they did fade away once Jiang Yanli made it clear that Wei Wuxian was her little brother, and Jin Zixuan made it very, very clear that he supported her.\u00a0\nOn the second day of feasting, they sit with their respective families. Wei Wuxian still sits next to Jiang Cheng, but now Lan Zhan also sits next to Wei Wuxian, his betrothed. Lan Qiren argued against them announcing their betrothal so close to Jiang Yanli\u2019s wedding, claiming it was bad taste. But Wen Qing pointed out that his nephew was either going to be accused of bad taste or promiscuity, and really there was a clear lesser evil of the two.\nLan Xichen sits next to his two sworn brothers, but glances over at his little brother occasionally, watching Wangji interact with his fianc\u00e9 with a pleased smile. Jin Guangyao of course congratulated them, while inwardly panicking over the newfound influence of the Jiangs\u2013his father didn\u2019t seem to realize that it was Jiang Yanli who influenced Jin Zixuan and not the other way around\u2013and how he could possibly orchestrate Wei Wuxian\u2019s downfall now. The Lans were tightlipped on a regular day, and they were positively mute when it came to the matter of the purification ritual, saying only that Wei Wuxian had their support. Lan Xichen was a terrible liar and would never try to lie to Jin Guangyao, but he insisted that what happened was private and any secrets that may have gotten revealed were not Xichen\u2019s to disclose.\u00a0\n\u201cWen Qing says there\u2019s a good chance I can cultivate a new one,\u201d Wei Wuxian is saying, cheeks stuffed with rice. He\u2019s had a ravenous appetite ever since he woke up, and not a wide enough variety of food to satisfy him. \u201cWell, she says that this is all theoretical given that it\u2019s never happened before, but she\u2019s hopeful.\u201d Wei Wuxian swallows, an afterthought to his mostly one-sided conversation with Lan Zhan. \u201cPersonally, I think between the two of us there\u2019s no way we won\u2019t succeed,\u201d he concludes cheerfully. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll help, won\u2019t you, Lan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He doesn\u2019t speak during meals, but he also can\u2019t  not respond to Wei Wuxian. He pushes another bowl of rice closer to Wei Wuxian, and begins scanning the table for another bowl of turnip and pork soup.\n\u201cStop plying him with food,\u201d Jiang Cheng says grumpily from Wei Wuxian\u2019s other side.\u00a0\nLan Zhan glares at him and deliberately places his soup in front of Wei Wuxian, who lights up in delight.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian gifts Lan Zhan with one of his special smiles. \u201cYou spoil me too much!\u201d\n\u201cI have a lot to make up for,\u201d Lan Zhan says seriously.\nWei Wuxian turns red. \u201cI\u2019ve already said\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIs he still trying to apologize?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighs.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, a tad smugly. \u201cLet him.\u201d\nWei Wuxian sighs again and leans back in his seat. He looks to his right and left, and then further down the table, where Jiang Yanli sits next to Jin Zixuan, who can\u2019t seem to look away from her.\n\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThis all worked out for the best, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nHis hand snakes out, reaching for a glass, and Lan Zhan places a hand over his before he can reach it, reminding him with a look Wen Qing\u2019s ban on alcohol. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees.\u00a0\nFrankly, Wei Wuxian could tell him the sky was pink and Lan Zhan would agree. But the way Wei Wuxian lights up with a smile, bright enough to drown the sun, is worth it.\u00a0"
