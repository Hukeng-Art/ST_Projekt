    "text": "Shouto floats, sometimes.\nNot in the physical sense, he doesn't mean it like that. He doesn't have a Quirk that allows him to fly or affect gravity like\u00a0Uraraka's does,\u00a0as much as he sometimes wishes he did.\nHe's aware of his body\u00a0weighing him down and keeping him tethered to the earth, feet and legs sometimes so distressingly heavy that Shouto finds it\u00a0difficult to get out of bed.\u00a0\n(\u201cGet up.\u201d his father looms over him, a familiar scowl on his face. \u201cIf you stay down like this then your opponent won't hesitate to kill you.\u201d\nShouto presses his cheek to the floor, chest heaving and muscles spasming, and thinks,\u00a0would it be such a bad thing to be ki-)\nMentally, emotionally, he'll float.\nSometimes Shouto is acutely aware of when his mind separates itself from his body. His ears will ring, and he'll forget about the sentence he's stringing together, mind growing fuzzy and thick. (He must always say the right thing in the end as nobody ever calls him out on it otherwise.)\u00a0\nSometimes he'll find himself tuning in mid conversation to see his classmates\u2019 lips moving but he's not able to comprehend what they're saying, the words jumbled and foreign to his ears.\nWhen the world starts to blur and fade, that\u2019s when he knows he's going to float.\nThe worst times are the ones where Shouto will blink in his dorm room and then two, three blinks later he'll find that he's sitting in class or standing outside the hospital his mother's in, snapping back to himself with gaps of time missing from his mind. He never has any recollection of how he gets there, let alone what day or time it is. It'll startle him, scare him maybe, but he's learnt to keep his face blank over the years, masking most of his emotions, and is quiet enough in general that nobody ever picks up on his silences as anything abnormal.\nWell that's what he\u00a0had\u00a0thought at least.\nHe thought that people wouldn't pick up on his distant gazes or long pauses, would brush them off as aloofness or arrogance.\nHe thought that because he was quiet anyway (reserved, his sisters voice whispers.\u00a0You don't always have to be so reserved around me, Shouto.) his days of silence would be brushed aside, most likely be considered as rudeness, but he didn't mind that.\u00a0\nHe thought that maybe people wouldn't notice because Shouto doesn't try to engage, doesn't let himself get drawn in to their class activities, stays quiet and true to himself, and yet-\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kirishima\u2019s face is closer than Shouto remembers, eyebrows furrowed and lips downturned in the corners.\nHe looks concerned, his brain supplies. Weird.\nShouto blinks again, mind fuzzy, and then Ashido is leaning against the desk next to him with a concerned frown of her own, sharing a look with Kirishima when Shouto keeps quiet for what must be too long.\nHe blinks again, trying to force the murkiness back, murmuring a small\u00a0\u201cI'm fine.\u201d\u00a0that does nothing to appease his classmates if their next shared look is anything to go by.\nShouto takes in his surroundings and notes that all of 1-A are in their classroom, most sitting at their desks whilst others, like Jirou and Kaminari, are milling about so that they can chat to their friends. He isn't sure how he got here, the last thing in his mind being his reflection in the mirror, face pale and toothbrush being held in his shaking hand. He can't have lost more than an hour though as Aizawa hasn't arrived for class yet.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Kirishima presses. Todoroki blinks again, confused as to why Kirishima's eyes are shining worriedly, but the other boy continues before Shouto can repeat that he's fine. \u201cIt's just that you weren't at dinner last night. Or breakfast this morning. And uh, you're looking pretty...\u201d he trails off with a grimace, hand gesturing in Shouto\u2019s direction.\n\u201cYou just pointed to all of me.\u201d Shouto says blankly. He wonders just how bad he must look for Kirishima to point it out, wonders what is so off about him that his classmates have decided to voice their concerns to his face.\n\u201cYou're shaking.\u201d Yaoyorozu\u2019s quiet voice points out from his left.\n\nIs he?\n\nShouto looks down to where his hands are sitting on his desk and figures that shaking is one word for it. His fingers keep jerking and twitching whilst trembles run up his arms and down his body. Now\u00a0it's been pointed out to him, the fog fading from his mind even more, he notices that even his legs are trembling under his desk.\nThat's\u00a0odd,\u00a0Shouto thinks. He tries to throw his mind back to try and recall why he'd be shaking but he comes up blank.\n\u201cDo you need to go to the nurse?\u201d Ashido asks him, voice hushed. Kirishima had also been quiet when he\u2019d spoken, and he notes absently that they've formed a small half circle around him, effectively blocking him from everyone else's view.\n(His eldest brother is stood to one side of him, eyes staring down at Shouto with a mix of awe and worry, whilst his sister is sat down on her knees in front of him, hands gentle as they hold his own shaking ones.\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d she says quietly. \u201cIt's going to be okay.\u201d\nShouto\u2019s huddled in a corner, tears running down his cheeks, whilst his siblings surround him in a protective circle. A door downstairs bangs open and they press in closer, faces grim and determined, as\u00a0all of their postures grow stiffer. His brother twists to face the door and takes a wider stance, one hand reaching out to touch Fuyumi's hair whilst the other curls into a fist at his side. He looks as if he's going to try and physically protect Shouto from their parents with his body alone and it makes Shouto cry harder.\n\u201cW-what's going to h-happen?\u201d Shouto hiccups.\nAround them, the room is ruined. There's ice covering the floor, creeping up the walls in\u00a0frosty tendrils, whilst the chair he was sitting in earlier is scorched. The smell of smoke hangs heavy in the air and Shouto knows there's no way his parents won't notice (that his\u00a0father\u00a0won't notice) the changes in the room, the change in Shouto.\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d his sister repeats, eyes wet but hands steady where they hold his own burning one's. \u201cYou'll be okay.\u201d\n\u201cHe's g\u2019na know I've got my Quirk.\u201d Shouto sniffs. \u201cWhat will happen?\u201d\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d His older sister sounds scared and it makes him sob. \u201cI'm sorry, Shouto.\u201d\nThey hear their fathers\u2019 heavy footsteps climb the stairs and his sister squeezes his hands as they draw closer, her eyes holding his gaze as the door slams open.)\nThey're trying to be nice.\u00a0Shouto thinks.\u00a0They're trying to stop the others from noticing.\nHis skin feels sticky and he realises that he probably hasn't showered in a few days, let alone eat, which\u00a0would explain\u00a0the trembling.\nIt's been a long few days of being half aware, small flashes of time missing between longer periods of feeling fuzzy and absent. He'd received a text from his father earlier in the week and it was nothing discriminating, nothing harsh, just a simple\u00a0i hope you remember your training Shouto. you can be better than all of them.\u00a0If anything, it had been kind, or as kind as it gets when his fathers involved. It had still been enough to set him off though, enough to cause days of fluctuating in and out of being here and being nowhere at all.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d Yaoyorozu\u2019s hand touches his shoulder and he tenses (he doesn't\u00a0flinch) and she stills, hand hovering above him.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Ashido\u2019s frown deepens in what\u00a0must\u00a0be concern, or maybe some other emotion Shouto doesn't know about, eyes sad, but\u00a0he can't help but read her posture and think\u00a0she's angry.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d he says automatically, mind\u00a0taking in the tense postures and furrowed eyebrows\u00a0surrounding\u00a0him and supplying the words that have always had the chance of diffusing the situation. The others seem to loom over him and he knows seeing it as looming is stupid, is ridiculous even, because only Kirishima and Ashido are standing and if Todoroki could bring himself to stand up he'd easily be on their level, if not taller. \u201cI'm fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't look fine.\u201d Kirishima says bluntly.\n\u201cDon't worry about it then.\u201d Shouto returns, probably a bit too harshly. \u201cLeave it alone.\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki-kun.\u201d Yaoyorozu\u2019s sounds more worried now which is the opposite of the reaction Shouto was going for. \u201cIf you're sick then I'm sure Aizawa-sensei will let you skip class and rest if you need to.\u201d\n\u201cYou should all be in your seats already.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice rings out, bursting the small bubble they'd been in. Kirishima and Ashido hesitate, sharing another look and glancing towards Shouto and then, when his appearance doesn't soothe their worries, towards Yaoyorozu. He sees her nod out of the corner of his\u00a0vision and, after Aizawa slaps his hands on his desk, the other two\u00a0slink off towards their seats.\nShouto pulls his still shaking hands from his desk and rests them on his legs, not wanting anyone else to notice his trembling, breathing in deeply through his nose and trying to ground himself. It's hard to do when his brain is still half submerged in fog and the sounds of the class talking is creating white noise in his ears. The room starts to blur around him and he squeezes his nails into his shaking thighs, trying to focus on where Aizawa is saying something at the front of the class.\nHe can feel Yaoyorozu\u2019s eyes on him\u00a0as he watches Aizawa\u2019s lips move, words not registering in his mind, but he blinks once, and the room starts to fade. Another blink and the room is half empty.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d Yaoyorozu\u2019s gentle voice rings in his ears, swimming around the mess of his brain. \u201cHey, you with me?\u201d\nHer face is in front of him then as she crouches by his desk, dark eyes soft and worried as she slowly reaches her hand out to lightly touch his arm. He doesn't\u00a0tense up when her fingers touch him this time, brain registering her posture and tone as\u00a0calm\u00a0and\u00a0safe.\n\u201cShouto?\u201d she says in a softer voice.\n(\u201cShouto?\u201d\u00a0he hears his sister call. It makes his footsteps falter as he twists around to try and find Fuyumi, eyes desperate and heart beating faster after almost a month without seeing her. His new training routine is so rigorous and draining that he\u2019s done nothing but sleep in his spare time, unable to find the time or energy to sneak into the part of the house were his siblings reside.\nFuyumi is standing in the courtyard, eyes wide and mouth open in shock. She's taller than Shouto remembers her, hair longer and skin paler. She's still familiar though, familiar and safe, and Shouto feels his eyes tear up at the sight of her.\n\u201cNo.\u201d his father snarls, grip tightening around Shouto\u2019s wrist as he yanks him forward. \u201cThat's not your life anymore Shouto. Remember that.\u201d)\nHe blinks as she squeezes his arm, face familiar and not so familiar at all. \u201cIt's time for lunch.\u201d she explains, using her grip on his arm to help\u00a0pull him up.\nShouto nods, disorientated at the loss of time and blurring faces but not wanting to let that show, dreading the thought of alerting someone to the fact that\u00a0he's been floating all morning. He'd rather let Yaoyorozu think he's\u00a0sick then let on to anything else.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d she asks, bending down to pick both of their bags up and sling them over her shoulder. \u201cYou seemed pretty out of it all morning.\u201d\n\u201cTired.\u201d Shouto supplies. Yaoyorozu hums in reply, taking his hand in hers when Shouto makes no effort to move. She gives him a gentle tug\u00a0and he follows her easily, trusting that she'll take him somewhere safe if not back to the dorms. Yaoyorozu has never been anything but kind to him and his trust in her has grown into something more stable after their rescue mission for Bakugou.\n\u201cYou do seem tired.\u201d She agrees as she leads them out of the now empty classroom. \u201cI'm guessing you're hungry too, right?\u201d Shouto\u2019s stomach rumbles in reply and he can feel his cheeks flush, looking away from Yaoyorozu\u2019s knowing eyes.\nHer palm is warm in his and it\u2019s the first time in a long time Shouto can remember somebody actively touching him without any intention of hurting him. It's\u00a0strangely\u00a0grounding and Shouto feels the fog in his head recede slightly, thoughts becoming clearer and his body\u2019s state registering in his mind. His stomach is cramping from hunger, which is probably to be expected as Shouto can't actually remember the last time he ate a proper meal. His head is pounding behind his eyes and his throat feels dry and scratchy, his skin thin and blood thick where it's being pumped through his veins.\nHe's still shaking, knees feeling weak and legs heavy, and if it wasn't for Yaoyorozu\u2019s oddly strong grip on his arm then he figures he would've lilted to one side by now.\nHe feels like he owes Yaoyorozu\u2019s kindness some honesty and chooses to share a half-truth with her. \u201cI've been a bit sick.\u201d his voice is scratchy and it hurts to speak. \u201cA headache. I forgot to eat because of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven't eaten?\u201d she asks, sounding sad and a bit frustrated. She doesn't sound angry though, which Shouto takes as a win.\nHe apologises regardless but Yaoyorozu waves it away, looping her arm through his. \u201cYou're lucky it's lunch.\u201d she tuts. \u201cI'll have to feed you up before judging whether it's okay for you to come to this afternoon's lesson or not.\u201d\n\u201cYou can't actually decide whether I come to class or not you realise?\u201d Todoroki feels touched by her statement nevertheless, left side of his face feeling hotter under her concern.\n\u201cWho's deciding whether we get to go to class?\u201d Ashido\u2019s voice rings out as they enter the hallway. She's leaning against the wall with Jirou next to her, both of them seemingly having been waiting Yaoyorozu to leave the classroom. \u201cBecause I'd do anything to get an afternoon off.\u201d\n\u201cNot you.\u201d Yaoyorozu scoffs. \u201cThis idiot here.\u201d she jostles their arms, making Shouto stumble, but pulls him back to her side easily, taking on more of his weight when the hallways shifts sideways and he can't find his footing.\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Ashido jumps forward to help support him. \u201cCareful Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cWhat's up with him?\u201d Jirou demands and then, voice wary. \u201cHe's not contagious, is he?\u201d\n\u201cStupidity isn't contagious.\u201d Yaoyorozu says snootily. She glances at Shouto and says in a softer tone. \u201cSorry Todoroki.\u201d\nHe\u00a0isn't sure if she's apologising for the insult or for making him fall, but he accepts it anyway, bowing his head in forgiveness and keeping it low as he tries to regain his spinning vision.\nAshido links her arm with Shouto\u2019s spare one and helps Yaoyorozu support him as they slowly make their way towards the lunch hall. He feels embarrassed at needing the\u00a0support\u00a0but he's too tired to shrug them off, so he focuses his attention on the floor instead, trying to keep\u00a0his steps steady as his classmates continue to talk around him.\n\u201cWhat's up with you then, Todoroki?\u201d Jirou asks. Shouto can't bring himself to answer, feeling too sick and lightheaded to say what's happening to him. Luckily Yaoyorozu doesn't seem to mind supplying the answers\u00a0on his behalf.\n\u201cHe hasn't been looking after himself.\u201d she sounds fond, if not slightly annoyed, and it's a tone that confuses him. \u201cHe's forgotten to eat, and by the looks of it, sleep as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u00a0is\u00a0stupid.\u201d Jirou agrees. \u201cWhat's up with that?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s had a headache.\u201d\nAshido coos next to him, fingers rubbing circles into his arm. \u201cIf you're not feeling well then you need to speak up.\u201d\n\u201cA classic man.\u201d Jirou murmurs.\nYaoyorozu snorts. \u201cLike you weren't the one hiding that nasty cough the other week.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Jirou sniffs. \u201cI bet Todoroki just doesn't know how to look after himself because he's so used to his mom doing everything for him.\u201d\nHer words shouldn't jar him as much as they do but Shouto finds his breath hitching, footsteps stuttering, and if Yaoyorozu and Ashido hadn't been holding him up then he probably would've fallen again.\nIt's not like any of his classmates\u00a0would\u00a0know about his home life, he knows. He'd told Midoriya about his mother before the sports event but bar that he hasn't spoken a word of it since. He hasn't been able to bring himself to do anything but think about it, new thoughts and memories doing nothing but haunting him day and night.\nWhy would any of his classmates know about his mother? Why would they know what she did? What his father made her do?\n(\u201cUnsightly.\u201d his mother's voice is unhinged, full of hate and fear, and it's not\u00a0a tone that's ever been directed at Shouto before. Her grip on the kettle is shaking and\u00a0he takes a step back in confusion.\n\u201cMom?\u201d he asks hesitantly.\n\u201cSo unsightly.\u201d she repeats, grip tightening on the handle. \"So ugly.\")\nHe blinks when a tray is placed in front of him. He looks around to see that they're in the canteen now, Jirou and Yaoyorozu sitting opposite him whilst Ashido is by his side, arm still looped with his.\nIt's been worse than this before, the floating, but usually nobody in class will be paying him this much attention. To fade away whilst\u00a0walking\u00a0with people from his class is horribly embarrassing, shameful even. Shouto desperately tries to force the murkiness in his mind to the back, shaking his head in the hopes to help clear it and letting his bangs fall into his eyes.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d he murmurs absently. He's not quite sure who exactly got him a tray of food, but he knows that it couldn't have been him.\n\u201cDon't worry about it.\u201d Yaoyorozu flaps her hands again, face kind when Shouto chances a glance at it. \u201cJust make sure you eat it all up, okay? I can't have you passing out on me.\u201d\nIt takes a nudge from Ashido to prompt him into grabbing his chopsticks, but the motions of eating come easily to him after the first bite, hand lowering the chopstick to and from his plate as he chews robotically.\nHe wonders if any of the girls had noticed his... Slip up. He wonders whether they'd been aware that although Todoroki was with them, he wasn't really there at all.\u00a0A big part of him hopes that they\u00a0didn't notice anything amiss. He can't face their questions, their concern, and he really doesn't want to disappoint them by not having any of the answers either. A small part of him though, a tiny ember at the back of his mind, hopes that they did notice. A part of him wants help, is almost desperate for it, but Shouto stomps that thought out before it can catch alight.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Jirou says, foot nudging into Shouto\u2019s under the table and directing his attention to her.\nOne hand is pushing pork around her plate whilst the other is fiddling with the cord hanging from her ear.\u00a0She's nervous\u00a0his mind supplies. Her eyes are big and genuine as she stares at him and he cocks his head in confusion, wondering what he's missing.\n\u201cFor making a comment about your mom.\u201d she continues when Shouto does nothing but blink at her.\nOh.\u00a0Right, that.\n\u201cI didn't think it'd upset you. So, I'm sorry.\u201d\nHe chews slowly, considering his next steps carefully. People apologising to him is unknown territory and Shouto doesn't want to offend Jirou by handling it wrong. It\u2019s not like she was to know what happened between him and his mother. The media had only ever gotten wind of the fact that her and his father split apart but they never had any content behind it. Nobody could know that he hadn't seen his mother in years or that she'd backed him into a corner as a child, eyes wide and unseeing as she-\n(\u201cWhat are you doing mommy?\u201d Shouto feels his back hit the wall as he stares at his mom, at where she's staring at him like he's a stranger whilst her hands tighten into a white knuckled grip on the kettle.)\nIt\u2019s not like anyone would know what happened.\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d Shouto says. \u201cYou weren't to know anything was amiss with the subject of my mother. You don't have\u00a0to apologise.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Jirou insists. \u201cI shouldn't have made a comment regardless. I'm sorry.\u201d\nHe doesn't think there's anything to be forgiven but he doesn't want to upset Jirou further, so he murmurs a quiet \u201cI forgive you.\u201d, feeling pleased\u00a0when\u00a0her shoulders lose their stiffness.\nShouto can\u2019t help but feel guilty still,\u00a0can't help but feel like he owes\u00a0Jirou an explanation of why he was upset, and he wants to let her know that it's his fault for not being able to move on from something that happened\u00a0years ago. It's not like he hasn't been able to tell someone from his class before, he'd actually felt relieved after he had, and Midoriya doesn't treat him any differently for it. He doesn't see why these three girls would either.\n\u201cMy mother is at a hospital.\u201d he says, pausing when Ashido makes a sad noise next to him.\n\u201cI'm so sorry to hear that.\u201d she squeezes his arm again, grip oddly comforting. \u201cIs she sick?\u201d\n\u201cShe's doing better now,\u201d he thinks of her absent gaze the last time he went to visit, the way she gave him a polite smile as if\u00a0he was another nurse. \u201cBut she's in there because of something she did a long time ago.\u201d His hand absently comes up to cover his scar and he finds he can't say anymore, the words turning to ash in his mouth and clogging his throat.\u00a0He thought that he'd be able to tell the story again, but it appears that he can't, the air in his lungs growing thick and the memories rolling unpleasantly in his mind.\n(Shouto barely shuts his eyes in time as the freshly boiled water starts to pour towards his face. The first splash steams and burns, the feeling of burning so different to the fire he's used to on his left side,\u00a0and everything after growing worse, so much worse-)\nHe looks up, hoping to distract himself, to see Jirou looking at him with a- well, he isn't sure what word to use to describe her expression as. Her lips are pressed tightly together, downturned and thin, which would suggest sadness, but her eyebrows are furrowed, and her eyes remind him of Midoriya\u2019s whenever he tries to save Bakugou. She looks what Shouto hesitantly places as protective, as concerned, and when he glances\u00a0around the table he sees the other two with similar looks on their faces.\nThey don't press him to explain, seemingly being able to put the dots together without much more from him. Yaoyorozu eyes are shining slightly with tears and Shouto feels bad for making her upset.\n\u201cI'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause you any distress.\u201d he tells her, letting his eyes fall back onto his plate.\n\u201cHey, no. I'm not upset with you, Todoroki-kun.\u201d he glances up in confusion at that. \u201cI'm upset\u00a0for\u00a0you.\u201d\nIt's a sentiment Todoroki is unfamiliar with, but it makes something warm swell up inside him, a fluttery feeling blooming in his stomach as an embarrassed blush spreads across his cheeks.\nThe fog has faded from his mind and he knows that it\u2019s most likely from the food he's just eaten, but that small part of him reignites with new hope, hope that the conversation and the people surrounding him are what have grounded him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis shaking dies down after lunch,\u00a0headache\u00a0turning\u00a0into something more manageable, and\u00a0Yaoyorozu deems him well enough to\u00a0attend\u00a0the afternoon class. When Kirishima walks in and sees him sitting at his desk he comes over to poke at his cheeks, teeth flashing in a happy smile. \u201cNice to see you've got some colour back in your face, Icy-hot.\u201d\nShouto stays very still, fingers twitching at the feeling of having his face prodded and pinched. He doesn't think he's ever been touched this much in the same day for years.\nHis mind stays steady for the rest of the week, thankfully, and it allows Shouto to keep to his usual routine of attending his classes, training, and going to bed after attending Midoriya's mandatory\u00a0one hour of social time. Well, he tries to keep to it as best he can,\u00a0but his class have taken to trying to get him involved\u00a0to a whole new level.\n\u201cHello Todoroki-kun.\u201d Iida and Uraraka are\u00a0standing\u00a0in the common room when Todoroki comes back from training at the gym, scarves wrapped around their necks and coats on. \u201cWe're gonna go grab some ice cream if you fancy coming with.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Shouto\u2019s glances between where\u00a0Uraraka is looking at him with her big eyes, wide and earnest, and towards where Iida is giving him a small genuine smile. \u201cNo thank you.\u201d he says, confused about their offer. Maybe they were heading out and had only offered to invite Shouto out of politeness.\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Iida says easily. \u201cEnjoy your evening Todoroki-kun.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, Iida-san.\u201d Shouto nods politely before continuing towards the lift at a slower pace, mind trying to find a reason as to why they'd invite him out.\n\u201cYou'll have to come with us next time.\u201d Uraraka calls to his back which makes him pause mid step. He twists around, curious to see if she's joking with him, but the door to the dorms has already swung shut behind them.\nHe shrugs off the weird interaction, unsure on how to take it, and continues up to his room.\nThat's the first instance of something happening.\n\u201cHey Shouto-kun!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice calls as Shouto steps outside. \u201cWait up!\u201d\nIt's not uncommon for Midoriya to try and\u00a0walk him to class but it\u00a0is\u00a0weird that he called him-\n\u201cShouto-kun?\u201d he repeats, raising a confused eyebrow.\nMidoriya flushes, cheeks and ears growing red as he offers a nervous laugh. \u201cW-well, yeah. We're friends, right?\u201d\nFriends. Todoroki Shouto isn't used to the term, doesn't really understand what the emotions behind the word mean, let alone if he could apply it to the relationship he has with Midoriya.\nFriendship. A person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically one exclusive of sexual or family relations.\nDoes he feel affection for Midoriya? Is that what the warm soft feeling that blooms inside of him every time he sees the smaller boy is? If so, does that mean that Shouto has somehow befriended his other classmates without him even realising?\n\u201cS-sorry I just thought t-that-\u201d Midoriya\u2019s face is red and he\u2019s fiddling with the strap on his backpack\u00a0nervously. He's nervous because Shouto hasn't responded to his question, nervous because he thinks he's overstepped a line, nervous because he thinks Shouto isn't his friend.\nIt makes the warm feeling in him grow like a flower in the sun, like sugared candy melting on his tongue, and he could label the feeling as affectionate.\u00a0A mutual affection.\n\u201cWe can be friends.\u201d Shouto decides, interrupting Midoriya's nervous rambling, feeling his heart\u00a0soften at the thought. He, Todoroki Shouto,\u00a0has a friend within\u00a0Midoriya.\u00a0\n\u201cCan be?\u201d Midoriya splutters. \u201cI thought we already were but, u-uh, thanks?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Shouto feels a grin tug at the corners of his mouth, small and private, and Midoriya must see it because he gives him a bright smile in return, something so warm and\u00a0blinding that it rivals the sun on a summer\u2019s day.\nAnd then, later that week.\n\u201cAre you going to fucking watch this fucking movie with us or what?\u201d Bakugou snarls as he slams Shouto\u2019s dorm room open.\n\u201cBakugou!\u201d Kirishima\u2019s voice rings out from behind him. \u201cI told you to knock!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not knocking on this bastard\u2019s door. He\u2019s making us all wait for him and I\u2019m fed up from it. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not dragging him down the fucking stairs right now.\u201d\nShouto twists his head to see the two boys standing in his doorway, Kirishima looking apologetic whilst Bakugou glares at him.\n\u201cUm.\u201d Shouto says blankly, head feeling a bit fuzzy. He\u2019d shut himself in his room when he felt the clouds start to roll in, choosing to skip his workout to lay on\u00a0his floor instead\u00a0and watch as the walls melted around him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d Bakugou demands, hands curling into fists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s movie night.\u201d Kirishima explains when Todoroki continues to stare at them blankly. \u201cWe all said to meet downstairs at eight, remember?\u201d\n\nNo.\n\n\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d Shouto chews on his bottom lip, unable to remember the conversation he'd apparently had to agree to this.\nHe doesn\u2019t like being reminded of conversations he\u2019s had with people whilst he\u2019s gone. It makes him uncomfortable and, if he's honest, a little bit scared. He pushes himself into a sitting position but doesn't move any further, feeling winded and dizzy from the simple motion.\n\u201cYou coming then?\u201d Kirishima asks from behind him after a short silence. \u201cIt\u2019s like, almost half past now.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Shouto presses his palms into his eyes, trying to force himself to focus. \u201cThe movie.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the fucking movie. Did you hit your fucking head, you idiot?\u201d Bakugou sounds even more annoyed now but Kirishima whispers something to him - something that blurs in Shouto\u2019s mind - and when he opens his eyes it's to the door slamming and Kirishima crouching down in front of him.\n\u201cSorry, he\u2019s got no tact.\u201d Kirishima reaches out slowly, the action oddly reminiscent of Yaoyorozu\u2019s a few weeks ago, and gently closes a hand around Shouto\u2019s forearm. He wonders if Yaoyorozu had warned him that Shouto reacts better to slower, gentler actions. \u201cAlright?\u201d He asks quietly, eyes tracing Shouto\u2019s face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t actually hit your head, did you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto says, blinking slowly through heavy eyelids. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nKirishima frowns at him. \u201cDid you get another headache? When was the last time you ate something?\u201d\n\nYaoyorozu did speak to him, then.\n\n\u201cI was at dinner.\u201d He feels stupid and embarrassed of the thought of his classmates discussing his health behind his back. A small part of him might feel touched by the action but Shouto ignores it, unsure what to do with the emotion.\n\u201cYou've got another headache then?\u201d Kirishima presses. \u201cBecause you should visit\u00a0Recovery Girl if so.\u201d\nHe wonders how Kirishima would react if Todoroki was to tell him that he finds himself fading from this world into\u00a0one devoid of anything on a weekly basis. What would the other boy do if he knew that Shouto sometimes wakes up to find that he\u2019s in the courtyard or sitting in the training hall with no memory of\u00a0how he got there. It all sounds crazy, even in his own mind, so he chooses to give a half-truth that won't end with him being sent away. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d\nShouto is always\u00a0so\u00a0tired.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch the movie if you\u2019d rather rest. I\u00a0can just tell the others you were busy.\u201d Kirishima squeezes him arm. \u201cBut if you\u2019re gonna rest then I\u2019d rather you do it in a bed, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouto agrees quietly. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s grateful or upset that the red headed boy is letting him off this easily.\u00a0\nKirishima helps pull Shouto up from the floor and waits until he's sitting on his bed before he takes his leave, shutting the door behind him with a \u201cFeel better man!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he floats, he feels nothing.\nHe wonders if the reason he disconnects from himself so often is because of the easy escape it offers him, the easy peace away from the mess of emotions he has to face in the real world.\nSometimes something will trigger his floating but often it\u2019ll just happen without his say so.\nThe only warnings he'll get is when words start to mash together, writing becoming unreadable and voices becoming distorted, but by then it's too late to fight against it. The colours around him will bleed into each other and create an ugly stain of darkness that he knows will consume him. He never used to leave for long, mind blocking things out instead of forcing Shouto to go, but ever since he started Yuuei things have gotten worse.\n(Ever since Midoriya reminded him of what he had, what he still has now. Ever since Shouto was reminded how it felt to\u00a0burn.)\nAfter a lot of thought and consideration he's worked out that speaking to someone about it will\u00a0result in\u00a0one of three possible outcomes:\nNone of the outcomes sound appealing and it makes Shouto even more hesitant to broach the subject with anyone.\n(\u201cYour mother isn\u2019t here anymore.\u201d His father tells all of them, arms crossed, and frown etched onto his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want any more questions about it. Shouto, come.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Shouto can\u2019t help but press, tears welling in his eyes. \u201cI want to see her.\u201d\nHis father, as predicted, ignores him as they make their way to the training room. Shouto can't help but keep asking though, voice growing hoarse and desperate as time passes on.\n\"She's coming home, right?\" He pants. He's been putting more effort into his training in the hopes his father will reward him with an answer. \"When she's done wherever she is, she'll come home to me, right?\"\nHe sees his father snap at his words, patience seemingly coming to its end as flames burst over his face with a quiet\u00a0whump.\u00a0Shouto recognises what's about to happen before it actually does, but that doesn't mean that his father\u2019s slap doesn't hurt. Tears spill out of his good eye, his left one still wrapped tightly in a bandage. The doctor told him that he may never be able to see out of it again, that the nerve damage may be too much for his body to mend.\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u00a0gone,\u00a0you stupid child.\u00a0She's gone and she's never coming back.\" His father says in a deep voice. Hot fingers grab Shouto's face and yank it up so that he's staring at his father\u2019s dark eyes.\u00a0\"You don\u2019t need her, Shouto.\" the fingers trace the bandage, making him shudder and cry harder. \"You were created to defeat All Might. You need to stop focusing on other people and focus on yourself. Now come, enough of this nonsense.\")\n(She\u2019s gone. She\u2019s gone. Shesgone.)\nShouto trails\u00a0his fingertips lightly over his scar, feeling his brain grow fuzzy at the action.\nMaybe his mother left the way he leaves, escaping\u00a0from this reality to somewhere that isn\u2019t particularly nicer but is definitely somewhere better.\nMaybe she also escapes to a familiar darkness where nothing matters.\n\u201cDid you hear we\u2019re allowed to go home this weekend?\u201d Sato says from beside him, Midoriya and Uraraka sitting cross legged on the floor opposite\u00a0them on training mats. Shouto wonders when he ended up in the training hall with everyone else but doesn't focus on that for too long, instead tuning into the more pressing matter of the conversation happening around him.\n\u201cAre we?\u201d Midoriya lights up. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d\n\u201cI overheard Aizawa-sensei talking to All Might.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Uraraka squeals. \u201cI haven\u2019t spent a night at home in forever!\u201d\n\u201cSame here.\u201d Sero pumps a fist in the air. \u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Uraraka shakes Midoriya's arm, swaying them both back and forth in her excitement. \u201cI\u2019ve missed my mom's cooking so much.\u201d\n\"God, yeah.\" Midoriya agrees. \"My mum sends me those care packages, but it'll be so nice to have a meal that's not reheated.\"\nShouto feels his ice creeping over his hand, mind reeling at the news as he try's his best to keep outwardly calm. His breathing has turned heavy, the air around him suddenly seeming too thick, and he wonders why they're being sent home, wonders whether there's any way out of it.\nHome is where his father is.\nHome is a life of vigorous training exercises, physical blows as a repercussion, and his father's hell fire.\nHome is the place where he was forced to grow up too young.\u00a0It's empty rooms that are haunted by his mother\u2019s voice, gentle as it whispers that she loves him\u00a0and cracking as she calls him a monster.\nWhen he tunes back into the class it\u2019s too see them all whispering excitedly to each other as Aizawa stands at the front of the room with his arms crossed. \u201cI put a lot of effort into getting this accepted.\u201d He\u2019s saying in a monotone voice.\u00a0\u201cSo, I expect you to honour my efforts by keeping out of trouble.\u201d He throws a hard look in Midoriya\u2019s and Bakugou\u2019s direction as he says it.\nHome. Shouto isn\u2019t sure his family house will ever be his home, isn't sure if it had ever been anyone's home besides his fathers.\n\u201cAre you excited to go home, Todoroki-kun?\u201d Uraraka asks him, face bright and happy. She looks the polar opposite to how he feels, he notes with disdain, and he isn\u2019t sure how to respond to her\u00a0in a voice that isn't bitter and biting, so he chooses to say nothing instead, pushing himself up off the floor and heading over to where Aizawa is waiting for them to line up.\n\u201cNot wanting to fawn over your weekend away?\u201d Aizawa raises an eyebrow at him.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather just get on with the lesson, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d Shouto says politely, averting his eyes to his shoes.\nAizawa hums and gives Shouto an unreadable glance before shouting for the rest of the class to line up.\nThey're doing strength training today in partners, two teams being put up against each other in practise.\nThe thought of being able to train is something of a relief. He's paired up with Kaminari to\u00a0fight against Asui and Jirou and at first, it's distracting enough for him to almost forget about having to go home in a few days. Almost.\nThe movements of fighting are soothing and for a while they help to numb his mind, to soothe his worries, but the niggling thought of going home to his father plays on his mind. Moving into the dorms was a blessing and being sent home, in Shouto's eyes, is a punishment of sorts. It has to be a punishment because any way Shouto looks at it he can't see it as anything but a retribution for something he's done wrong, something the class has failed at. His whole life has been\u00a0built up on\u00a0discipline and punishments and being sent home falls into a twisted version of this, the only rules he's known structuring his life into\u00a0right\u00a0and\u00a0wrong.\nThe training lesson quickly becomes a way for Shouto to let his frustrations out, for him to prove that he's the best in the class, because if he's good enough then maybe he can stay. If he's good enough then maybe, he won't have to be punished.\nShouto\u00a0pushes himself and his Quirk past what is probably deemed acceptable for a friendly class competition, large walls of ice standing tall and proud all over the arena as smoke billows around them.\nHe sees Midoriya and Uraraka giving him worried looks as his team is called out of the arena by a\u00a0frustrated\u00a0sounding Aizawa. Shouto considers heading over towards them but his hands are shaking at his sides and he feels\u00a0hot, burning and seething at the idea of having to interact with anyone. He notices Aizawa whispering something to All Might which pisses him off even more for some reason, irrational frustration bubbling across his skin and making him want to bare his teeth. He doesn't bother to mask his expression as he makes his way towards the back of the class, hoping his glare and display in the arena is enough to warn his classmates to stay away from him.\nShouto had\u00a0thought that after the training exercise he\u2019d feel calmer, more relaxed, and ready to accept his fate of having to spend his weekend away from the dorms but, as it is, his hands are vibrating with pent up energy\u00a0and he can\u2019t shake the frost from his face.\u00a0\u00a0\nHome is the place where he's faced years of abuse. Home is the place where his father lives, his father the number one hero, who has no idea what to do with Shouto now he's broken goods.\n(\u201cYou were created to beat All Might.\u201d)\nWith All Might beaten, who is Shouto now besides Endeavor\u2019s son?\n(\u201cIf you stay down like this then your opponent won't hesitate to kill you.\u201d\nShouto presses his cheek to the floor, chest heaving and muscles spasming, and thinks,\u00a0would it be such a bad thing to be killed?)\nHe\u2019s been left drifting, left floating in his own thoughts, his own past, for so long that Shouto wonders whether or not he drowned in them long ago, that the person left standing here now is nothing but a shadow of someone he could've been.\n(would it be such a bad thing to be killed?)\n(\u201cYour left side is unsightly. Ugly.\u201d)\n(His mother's eyes stare at Shouto likes he\u2019s a stranger. A monster.)\n\u201cTodoroki.\u201d All Might\u2019s voice jars him from where he\u2019s leaning against the wall. \u201cQuite an impressive display out there.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He murmurs politely, bowing his head in respect and curling his palms into fists to hide how they're trembling.\nIf he were to label his display, Shouto would choose the word erratic over impressive. If the look Kaminari keeps throwing him is anything to go by then it would seem that the other boy agrees with him. All Might doesn't seem to share any of the same sentiment though, throwing Shouto what seems to be a genuine smile.\n\u201cYour father's Endeavor.\u201d His teacher states\u00a0unprompted, tone light. \u201cThat must be pretty cool, huh? Having the number one hero as your dad.\u201d\n\u201cI think I preferred it when you were number one.\u201d Shouto mutters, nails biting into his palm.\n\u201cNo need to flatter me.\u201d All Might waves a hand in the air, eyes trailing over to where Midoriya is now training alongside Iida against Yaoyorozu and Hagakure. \u201cIf I had a kid, I would have wanted\u00a0them to proud of me.\u201d\nDo people think I\u2019m proud of my father?\u00a0Shouto frowns, ice and searing heat now digging into his hands, making them ache.\u00a0How could I ever be proud of the man who destroyed my life?\nIt\u2019s not like anybody knows the monster Shouto sees when he looks at his father. Nobody could know about the upbringing he was forced to endure but it still hurts to hear that All Might, the worlds hero, somebody Shouto used to look up to, expects him to be proud of his father. He expects Shouto to have had a good life, an easy life, and it makes his ribs feel too tight around his lungs.\n(His brothers are no longer allowed to speak or see him, his father warning Shouto not to get distracted by people like them. He still catches glimpses of them sometimes, playing happily in their side of the house or coming home from the public school they're allowed to attend.\nShouto has been confined to the other half of the house, the half with the training facilities and the room for his home schooling. His father tells him not to get distracted, to stay focused on getting better, on becoming the best.\nFuyumi is the only one of his siblings that is willing to interact with him, the only one willing to stand up to their father, but, after a while, Shouto finds himself too tired after training to do anything other than eat and sleep.\nTheir father doesn\u2019t have the time to spare for his other siblings, telling Shouto that he\u2019s the only thing that he\u2019s willing to invest his time in, that Shouto is his only perfect creation.\nShouto hates his father for everything he's done, feels an unbearable anger at his old man for it all. He hates himself too, though, for a part of him can't help but blame his mother for breaking on him, for leaving him, for making him take on all his father's attention alone.)\nFrost is creeping up the wall behind them and Shouto can see All Might frowning at him, lips moving in the shapes of words that he can't hear through the ringing in his ears.\nHow could people think that he\u2019s\u00a0proud\u00a0of Endeavor?\n(There isn't a moment in his life where Shouto doesn\u2019t know what the sound of his father\u2019s fist on his mother's skin sounded like. The sound of her crying is more familiar to him than her laughter and the smell of disinfectant on a cut is the first thing Shouto registers with his mother\u2019s smell.\nHe imagines that she would\u2019ve smelt like winter flowers once, pretty and delicate\u00a0yet still so strong, but he\u2019s only ever known the wilted version of her, the version of her that his father had destroyed.)\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud.\u201d He snarls, memories taunting him. He steps away from All Might, away from the image of his mother\u2019s curled up form, frost forming into ice on the floor below him. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of him.\u201d\n(He sees his mother's eyes, big and frightened, as his father looms over her. Endeavor has one hand wrapped too tightly around Shouto\u2019s arm, the grip crushing and bruising, as the other is raised in warning towards his mother. She still begs, regardless of the bruises forming on her body, pleading with his father to let\u00a0Shouto rest.)\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud to be his son.\u201d he feels flames licking at his face, at his scar, and he shudders, eyes shutting tightly.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d All Might is saying. \u201cHey, Todoroki, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n(\u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d His father snarls at his mother, yanking her off of Todoroki by her hair.\nTodoroki can\u2019t stop shaking, limbs twitching as he presses a hand to his eye, palm pressing into where it burns, where it sears, where his nerve endings are on fire. He\u2019s never known anything like this pain, never imagined that he could ever hurt this much. His lips are open in a silent keen, tears cutting through his skin like lava.\nHe sees his father slam his mother\u2019s face into the wall, hears the crunch of her nose breaking, feels the way his stomach churns from the pain of it all.\nFuyumi has one hand on his arm, trying to tug it away from where it\u2019s covering his face, gentle voice pleading with him, \u201cPlease Shouto, let me see. I need to see how bad it is.\u201d)\nHe can feel his Quirk unravelling before him as All Might\u2019s thin frame turns into something bigger, something hulking and familiar. Flames burst across the face that haunts his dreams, that haunts his days. Endeavor stands across from him with a smug look on his face, unhinged laughter pouring from his mouth as he wipes his mother\u2019s blood off his face. When his father jerks his hand towards Shouto, the shape of his fist all too familiar,\u00a0Shouto acts on instinct, ice forming from his hand and shooting towards his father. He makes sure that the spikes are large and sharp because his father can easily burn them away and-\nHis Quirk jolts to a stop and Shouto takes a heaving breath, panic clawing at his throat, because he needs to stop his father, needs to protect his mom, his sister, but then he blinks and his father melts into All Might. All Might who is defenceless without his powers, who has wide eyes and a hand raised to protect himself because there's spikes of ice inches away from his bare face.\nHe registers the feeling of his Quirk not working as Aizawa's eraser one in action.\nShouto\u2019s hand is shaking where he\u2019s holding it out in front of him, ears ringing as blood rushes to his head. He could\u2019ve killed All Might. He could\u2019ve killed him, would've maybe, had it not been for Aizawa. He was made to beat All Might, was created for this, but All Might had already been beaten, hadn't he?\u00a0\nShouto wasn't a weapon, not anymore, hadn't Midoriya taught him this? Hadn't Shouto been shown that he could be more than what his father wanted him to be?\nAizawa\u2019s face appears behind All Might\u2019s, hair floating around his head as he stares Shouto down.\n\u201cDrop your hand, Todoroki.\u201d He\u2019s saying. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\nShouto wants to drop his hand but his heart is racing, and he can't stop the panic racing around him, can't stop the feeling that something is wrong, that something is really really wrong. His head is thick with a smoke, thick and blinding -\n(\u201cStop protecting him, he was created to beat All Might. Your coddling of the boy will only ruin him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a\u00a0person, Enji! He\u2019s your\u00a0son,\u00a0not some sort of weapon for you to train.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s what I\u2019ll make him and-\u201d The sound of a palm\u00a0striking skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll do your best to remember that.\u201d)\nA hand touches his outstretched arm and Todoroki jerks around to see Midoriya, stupid, kind Midoriya, looking at Shouto gently, lips moving slowly as if he knows Shouto can\u2019t hear\u00a0what he's saying properly.\nIt\u2019s okay,\u00a0his lips say.\u00a0You\u2019re okay.\nShouto glances up to see his class staring at him in horror, eyes wide and stances ready to fight.\n(Because it must be horror, surely. It couldn\u2019t be anything like concern because concern does nothing but damage him. Shouto wasn\u2019t made for kindness. He was made to be the best, to be trained, to bleed, to learn.)\n\u201cStand down, Shouto-kun.\u201d Midoriya says firmly, voice free of stutter because he\u2019s doing what he was made to do, be a hero.\nHe\u2019s a better hero than Shouto will ever be, always standing up for what\u2019s right and protecting people even if it means hurting himself. Shouto is the monster in this scenario. He\u2019s the villain that people need protecting from. He almost just killed All Might and over what? A comment about his father?\nShouto lets his arm go lax, lets Midoriya guide it down and away, leaving him shaking and sweating and so\u00a0so\u00a0confused.\n\u201cClass over.\u201d Aizawa says loudly. Nobody moves though, all left staring at the mess he\u2019s made. \u201cTodoroki.\u201d Aizawa directs his attention to where Shouto\u2019s standing behind shards of ice, gaze hard and making him shudder slightly. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nAizawa starts walking towards the exit, obviously expecting Shouto to follow him. Shouto can't though, feels like he's frozen in place, eyes stuck on the ice in front of him, flicking from the distorted reflection of himself towards where All Might is giving\u00a0him a long look (a considering look, a sad look, something kinder than Todoroki has ever been deserving of) before he turns to help round up the rest of the students.\u00a0\n\u201cTodoroki-kun,\u201d Midoriya says gently, squeezing his arm in what Shouto presumes is meant to be a reassuring gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\nHe\u00a0doesn\u2019t think Midoriya is in any place to tell him what\u00a0okay\u00a0is considering\u00a0Shouto's just tried to attack a teacher, just tried to attack Midoriya's idol, the ex-number one hero of their time, for no reason at all.\nWith a sudden clarity Shouto knows that he\u2019s going to get kicked off of the course for this. He\u2019s going to get kicked off the course and he\u2019s going to have to go back to living at home with his father permanently whilst the media drag his name through the mud.\n\nEndeavor\u2019s son tries to kill All Might!\n\nHis father is going to have to live with him whilst the media drags both of their names through the mud because of this.\n\u201cTodoroki.\u201d Aizawa is holding the door open, looking at him expectantly. \u201cDon\u2019t make me ask again.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you back at the dorms, okay?\u201d Midoriya squeezes his arm before nudging him carefully around the ice and pushing him towards the door.\nShouto highly doubts he\u2019ll ever be allowed to step foot in the 1-A dorms again, but he keeps that to himself, walking stiffly towards where Aizawa is waiting for him, head bowed and the feeling of his classmates\u2019 eyes heavy on his back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t see Midoriya at the dorms that night, as expected.\nWhat\u2019s unexpected\u00a0is the kindness Aizawa had shown him, a kindness Shouto struggled to understand.\nHis sensei had sent him home four days early with the promise of a mental health check with Recovery Girl\u00a0when he returns with the rest of his class on Monday.\nBecause Shouto is going to be returning to Yuuei, regardless of his actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I saw out there Todoroki, but I know it wasn\u2019t the same student I\u2019ve been teaching for the past year.\u201d Aizawa levels him with a long look, eyes softer than Shouto thinks is deserved. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with you, but I want to help if I can.\n\n\n\u201cHelp?\u201d Shouto asks quietly, stumped. \u201cAren\u2019t I getting expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be unwise to expel you for something I don\u2019t believe you were in control of. Unless you\u2019re telling me that you, in your right mind, would attack an unsuspecting teacher?\u00a0 A defenceless\u00a0one at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he rushes to say. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever- I don\u2019t.\" He takes a breath, trying to calm himself down. \"That\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Aizawa says, putting emphasis on his words. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t you, Todoroki. I want to help.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHelp how?\u201d Shouto feels like the conversation has gotten away from him and it\u2019s barely even started. He was fully prepared for\u00a0a punishment, for the removal of his license before he even got it, and to be kicked from the hero course.\n\n\n\u201cRecovery Girl can perform a mental health check on you to start with so that we can\u00a0see what's going on up there. Being a hero isn't easy, Todoroki, and your class has experienced\u00a0more than most your age.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMental health.\u201d Shouto repeats, words feeling thick and wrong on his tongue. He pictures his mother sitting in her hospital room, pictures his childhood without her, all because of her mental health.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as scary as it sounds.\u201d Aizawa folds his hands on his desk. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll help us help you.\u201d\n\nBecause apparently Shouto is someone who needs help, is someone who his teacher wants to help. He knows that the kindness\u00a0he's being shown is undeserved,\u00a0but he doesn\u2019t dare question it, not wanting Aizawa to change his mind on the matter. Shouto needs things clarified though because surely it can't just be this simple. What he did was\u00a0illegal,\u00a0was dangerous.\u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t somebody report what I\u2019ve done? Won\u2019t the school have to have a formal hearing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only people who know about this is your class, All Might, and me. I know All Might won\u2019t press anything and, if I know your class correctly, they\u2019ll keep quiet if it means helping you.\u201d\n\n\nBecause they all want to help him.\n\n\nHe's not sure what to do with this piece of information. A part of him wants to argue, wants to point out to Aizawa that he'd be breaking the law and it could end in both Shouto's expulsion\u00a0and him losing his job. He wants to ask Aizawa to report it for both their sake, but Shouto is tired.\n\n\nHe's so,\n\nso,\n\ntired.\n\n\nAll he's done for years now is keep quiet and pretend; he's so fed up of not being able to put the broken shards of himself back together that he doesn't dare fight the kindness being shown to him, doesn't have it in him to voice any his arguments.\u00a0\n\n\nHe takes another deep breath when he realises that he's stopped, shutting his eyes and drowning in the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\n\n\u201cI...\u201d Shouto breathes in again, holds for three, then breathes out. \u201cThank you, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProve that this is the right choice, okay?\u201d Aizawa taps his fingers on the table, making Shouto meet his eyes again. He waits until Shouto nods before continuing. \u201cWhat I think is best for you at the moment is for you to go home and rest for the remainder of the week. I\u2019ll sort things out on my end and you can return on Monday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHome?\u201d Shouto lets\u00a0out a shuddering laugh that leaves an ashy taste on his tongue. It was almost too good to be true, almost the ideal outcome, but the universe has had it out for Todoroki the second he was born. There's hell fire running through his veins and it's always condemned\u00a0him to a harsher fate. \u201cWill you tell my father what happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa pauses, giving Shouto a careful look. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want me to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d His voice comes out strained and he sees Aizawa eyes narrow at him in thought.\n\n\nShouto averts his eyes when the gaze gets too intense. Aizawa is looking at him with something dangerous, something almost like understanding, and it makes him feel vulnerable. The last thing Shouto wants is for anyone to think that they have him figured out.\u00a0His insides are a mess of ice and fire, beaten and battered by the harsh storm that's been raging between the two sides since he was a child. There is barely anything left of him that's whole and to think that somebody could begin to understand terrifies him in a way he's never felt before.\u00a0\n\n\nHe's always been happy being the quiet kid, the reserved one, because it meant that nobody knew, that there was no potential of anyone knowing. If anyone were to really know him they'd realise that he was a lie. They'd stop seeing him as reserved the second they realise that his personality is built up on a friendless childhood, lonely and empty, and his father\u2019s training, punishing and cruel. If anyone were to take a\u00a0look at his bruised heart and the poison that it pumps through him then they'd realise that he's nothing but a broken monster that's been chained and muzzled by his father\u2019s upbringing.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say there was an incident with your dorm room, if you would prefer?\" Aizawa says, voice more knowing then Shouto wants it to be. \"One that\u2019ll take us a week to mend and one that means you'll need to reside at home, resting from the incident that occurred.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Shouto is not below begging when it comes to his father, even if it inadvertently\u00a0confirms Aizawa's thoughts. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, then please.\u201d\n\nSo here Shouto is, standing outside his family home with his most important belongings thrown into his backpack and a note to give to his father, the story on it matching the one Aizawa had told his father over the phone.\nRegardless of the story given, Shouto knows that his father won\u2019t be happy with him returning home. He knows that sending him here to rest, to collect his thoughts and stabilise himself, was meant to be an\u00a0act of kindness on his Aizawa\u2019s part, but Shouto wasn\u2019t made to be coddled.\n(\u201cYour coddling of the boy will only\u00a0ruin\u00a0him.\u201d)\nHe can see his father walking down the path, flames flickering brightly in the dying light of the day. Being sent home in itself could be seen as a worse punishment than expelling him, depending on his father's mood. From the height of his flames Shouto guesses that it\u2019ll be a hard week for him, the opposite of what Aizawa wanted.\nYou deserve this, his mind whispers.\u00a0You deserve to get put in your place.\u00a0The voice sounds disturbingly like his fathers and it makes Shouto shudder. He knows that the words are true though, knows that\u00a0he\u00a0needs to be punished for his reckless actions, accidental or not. A twisted part of him craves the punishment, finding a familiarity in his father correcting his mistakes.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d His father pulls the gate open with a wicked grin on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. This is your home, remember?\u201d Shouto\u00a0drops his head and loosens his shoulders automatically, body melding itself into a submissive picture as he steps onto the property, gates shutting closed behind him with a deafening click. \u201cYour sister\u2019s on holiday so we have the house to ourselves for the week. Perfect for some father son bonding time, hm?\u201d\nYou deserve this,\u00a0he repeats to himself as he follows his father up the path and towards their house.\u00a0You deserve this, you deserve this, youdeservethis-\nIt\u2019s easy, Shouto finds, to fall back into the familiar routine of his childhood.\nTheir training starts that evening and his father picks back up as if they'd never stopped, beating Shouto in fights over and over until he's shaking, and dots are dancing in front of his eyes. He calls out the flaws he sees in Shouto, voice biting and\u00a0disappointed,\u00a0as if Shouto isn't trying his hardest on purpose. His father knocks him back harder than usual if Shouto does something he deems especially stupid, and by the time he calls it to a stop Shouto feels numb and is covered in a light scattering of burns.\nHis dad tells him to eat dinner and shower before going to bed as he\u00a0walks out of\u00a0the room, leaving Shouto wincing on a training mat on the floor. \u201cTraining starts at eight tomorrow, don\u2019t forget.\" His father says before he leaves. \"You may have let your training regime slip whilst attending that school, but I'll try my best to catch you up to speed.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBack when Shouto was still young enough to believe that love existed, he used to think that the relationship between him and his father was just a twisted form of it. He used to think that his father\u00a0trained\u00a0him hard because he cared, because he wanted Shouto to succeed, and that his heart was always in the right place even if his actions weren't. He used to convince himself that this must be love, for a parent should always love their child, and that any mistakes his father made were because things got twisted up along the way.\nNow that Shouto\u2019s older he understands that his father never held any feelings of love towards him, understands that the man has probably never known how to love anything his entire life. He knows now that the only thing his father will ever feel towards him is possession and greed. He sees Shouto as something to mould and shape, something there for him to control, and there's nothing he can do about it.\u00a0\nHis mother, Shouto used to think, loved him unconditionally. There was no one else in the world that looked after him like she did. There has never been anybody else willing to throw themselves in front of his father\u2019s blows for him, nobody willing to argue for his health when Shouto was worn down to the bone. She offered him a kindness that he took for granted at the time. Her soft touches and small smiles were saved for Shouto and Shouto alone and he'd accepted them easily, accepted them without question, when he should've been treasuring them. He knows that his mother loved him once, long ago, but Shouto also learnt that love is never unconditional.\nEverybody has their limits, has their breaking points, and his unsightly left side was the thing that broke his mother\u2019s love for him.\n(He overhears Ashido call him the hottest boy in their class and he can\u2019t get her words out of his head.\nHe spends that night staring at his reflection in the mirror, eyes glued to the ugly seared skin on his forehead and around his eye, tracing the way his red bangs fall and cover the worst of the scar. His mother called it unsightly, had done the unthinkable to him because of how ugly the left side of him was.\nHe traces his fingers over the thin skin and shudders, mind growing clouded, and wonders how anybody could look at him and think of anything other than\u00a0monster.)\nShouto was not made to be loved.\n\u201cGet up.\u201d his father snarls. Shouto can\u2019t get up, is too busy clutching his stomach and trying not to let his tired head lull into the pile of sick next to him. \u201cDo you always have to be so pathetic? You can\u2019t just give up all the time, Shouto.\u201d His father kicks lightly at his twitching legs, making him curl up tighter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in sending you to that school if they can\u2019t even teach you how to fight properly?\u201d\nThat has Shouto forcing his eyes open, glaring weakly up at his father.\n\u201cI could probably train you better myself.\u201d His dad muses, a nasty curl to his lips. \u201cIt might be better to pull you out of school if you aren't learning anything of value there.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto breathes, forcing himself up on shaking legs. He feels like he could collapse at any moment, but he refuses to stay down, refuses to let his father take him away from Yuuei and his classmates. His\u00a0friends.\u00a0The only freedom he's ever known.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d he repeats, spitting blood onto the floor and wheezing as his lungs burn. \u201cI can keep going.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d His father claps his hands, shifting into a more aggressive stance. \u201cYou need to learn stamina, boy. If you fall down like that during a real battle, then villains won\u2019t hesitate to kill you.\u201d\n(Shouto presses his cheek to the floor, chest heaving and muscles spasming, and thinks,\u00a0would it be such a bad thing to be killed?)\nFor the first time ever, he\u2019s grateful when the world grows blurred around him, walls oozing into the rippling floor as everything becomes distorted. He sinks into the nothingness\u00a0his mind provides him and lets his body cope with the rest, the act more familiar than Shouto ever wanted it to be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHe comes back to himself in flashes over the remainder of the week.\nBlink once and he\u2019s gasping as his father's hell fire scrapes his neck, the flames dancing and leaving charred flesh by his Adams' apple.\nTwice and he\u2019s shovelling pork and rice into his mouth robotically as his father sits opposite him holding a one-sided conversation, the words sounding foreign to his ears.\nThe third blink finds him sitting under a tree in\u00a0the garden, the nights stars shining brightly above him. His mind is half there for that one and, if he ignores the painful throbbing of his body, he could almost consider it peaceful. The sound of the wind rustling the leaves around him is a welcome sound, the way it laps at his burning skin soothing.\nThe\u00a0dark blue of the sky\u00a0stretches out above him, stars twinkling softly, and if Shouto lets his eyes flutter shut he can almost feel the presence of a body lying in the grass next to him, the sound of Midoriya's voice echoing around his head like they're both underwater. The older boy had tried to teach Shouto about the constellations late one night, both of them too unsettled to sleep. He'd seemed offended that Shouto hadn't already learnt them off by heart and Shouto had spent the next few hours listening to Midoriya rambling on about everything he knew about the stars and the stories behind them. It's one of\u00a0Shouto's more treasured memories, one of his most private ones, and he happily lets himself get lost in it.\nAnd then he blinks and finds himself sprawled on the floor, his father glaring down at him. \u201cI just want to make you better, Shouto.\u201d he snarls, flaming face just like the one from Shouto\u2019s nightmares. \u201cYou understand that, right? I just want to make you better.\u201d\nIt\u2019s disorientating to live in such small increments of time. He finds scrapes and bruises on his body that he can\u2019t remember getting, finds himself waking up with his stomach rumbling because he\u00a0hasn't eaten. He loses track of the days but when his father reminds him that he's going back to school tomorrow he suddenly finds himself standing before a mirror, staring at his own face and thinking to himself\u00a0how the fuck am I meant to hide this.\nHe thought that he\u2019d be excited to be going back to Yuuei dorms but, staring at the cut on his right cheek and the graze on his chin, he feels nothing but dread.\nAizawa sent him home to rest and Shouto knows that he looks like hell. He feels like hell too, body sore and aching and mind scattered. There are dark bags under his eyes and his hair is lank, face sticky from being unwashed. He can do something about that at least, Shouto thinks as he grabs his towel from his door and heads towards\u00a0the\u00a0bathroom. The rest will just have to be covered by a good enough a lie, a good enough story that explains the state he's in well enough, leaving no room for questions.\nWell that was the plan anyway but before he knows it Sunday evening has bled into Monday morning and he\u2019s being dropped off at the Yuuei gates, scanning himself onto the campus.\u00a0\nHe keeps his head ducked as he slowly makes his way over towards the 1-A dorms, feeling nervous about his meeting with Aizawa\u00a0later that morning, the words\u00a0mental health check\u00a0causing his stomach to roll unpleasantly. The thought of having to see his classmates on top of that makes frost curl on his fingertips, anxiety biting at him from all sides.\nHe isn\u2019t sure what Aizawa told the rest of the class about his absence, but he knows that there will never be an explanation good enough to paint them both in a positive light. The truth of the matter is simple: one of the top students from their class disappeared\u00a0for a week after\u00a0he attacked\u00a0a teacher.\nThe whole class saw him lose control and Aizawa can't stop them from remembering that, as much as Shouto wishes that something could be done. There's nothing anybody could ever say that would excuse what happened.\u00a0\nHopefully he\u2019s early enough that he's beaten everyone in returning to the dorms.\nHopefully he's early enough that people will still be collecting their belongings at their parents and saying their goodbyes, giving him more than enough time to sneak back up to his room and shut himself in there.\nHopefully Shouto can avoid having to face anyone until after his 09:00am meeting with Aizawa and Recovery Girl.\nIt's clinging onto those thoughts\u00a0that gives Shouto the courage to scan into the 1-A dorm and take a step inside. It\u2019s quiet, he notes with relief, quickly making his way towards the elevator, eyes trained to the floor. He doesn't realise before it's too late that he's mistaken quietness for\u00a0a shocked silence.\n\u201cTodoroki-kun!\u201d Shouto freezes at that, eyes growing wide at the sound of Iida\u2019s voice, of the other voices that slowly pick up talking again. He keeps his eyes low the ground as he slowly turns and looks over to where a familiar pair of shoes are.\nWhere many familiar pairs of shoes are and -\u00a0fucking christ,\u00a0he must be the last one back.\nHe feels the panic well up in his stomach, fingers tingling at his sides, unsure on what to do next. He could look up but that would mean facing his class, the class that saw him lose control and the class that Shouto is more rude than nice towards. It also means showing his bruised face, showing the tiredness that's painted across every inch of him.\nHe thought that he\u2019d be able to skip all of this, that Recovery Girl would fix the bruises and scrapes without anybody else seeing them and that he and Aizawa could come up with a story together. He ducks his head lower, bangs falling into his eyes. That can still be the plan, if he plays his cards right.\n\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to see you\u2019re back.\u201d Iida continues, oblivious to the fact that Shouto feels like he\u2019s going to throw up. \u201cAnd in time for breakfast, too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Uraraka\u2019s cheerful voice chimes in. \u201cWe were hoping you\u2019d arrive last night with the rest of us but Aizawa mentioned you might not of received the message about us returning early.\u201d\n\u201cFucking typical that they\u2019d let you off.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice scoffs. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been suspended for more than a week.\u201d\n\u201cBakugou!\u201d Karishma chides. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with us. Sorry Todoroki - you know what this hot head is like.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Bakugou shouts. \u201cDo you want to die, punk?\u201d\n\u201cI hope your week at home was nice.\u201d Asui offers over the sounds of the other\u00a0two arguing. \u201cAre you- uh, just going to stand there?\u201d\nHe probably looks stupid, frozen in place with his backpack in a white knuckled grip and eyes trained on the floor by his feet. He tries to think of something to say- of something to\u00a0do\u00a0- but he\u2019s not sure if he knows how to string together a coherent enough sentence to appease his class.\n\u201cI need to unpack.\u201d Todoroki winces when his voice\u00a0comes out dry and scratchy from disuse, words thick on his tongue.\n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Yaoyorozu agrees instantly, picking up on how uncomfortable he is. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let us stop you, Todoroki-kun. We can all catch up later.\u201d She puts emphasis on the last few words and he hears\u00a0voices murmur in agreement, making his right eye twitch.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Shouto mutters, turning away from them all and continuing towards where the elevator is, feet moving on auto-pilot. He thought that his class would be angry at him (and maybe a part of him\u00a0wanted\u00a0them to be angry at him) but they\u2019re being nothing but nice, nothing but\u00a0kind, and he doesn't understand why.\nHe goes to press the button for the elevator, needing to escape from\u00a0it all,\u00a0but the doors ding open before he can.\n\u201cShouto-kun!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice rings out from in front of him and then Shouto suddenly finds himself being lifted from the floor,\u00a0Midoriya's arms curled tightly around his waist in a hug.\u00a0\nThere was once a time where Shouto craved this sort of affection, where he would dream of his mother's gentle embrace, where he would imagine what it would feel like for Midoriya to spin him around like he does Uraraka and Asui, but now when Midoriya clutches him tightly, arms warm around his waist, it does nothing but hurt.\nIt\u2019s not the worst pain he\u2019s felt, far from it, but his injuries are still new, and they ache and throb when squeezed and Shouto can\u2019t help the gasp of pain that leaves his lips. Midoriya puts him down quickly, arms dropping to his own sides as Shouto presses a palm to his bruised ribs.\n\u201cShouto-kun?\u201d He says worriedly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Shouto breathes, eyes fluttering shut as the throbbing of his ribs die down into a dull ache. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Hi Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cHi.\u201d Midoriya sounds hesitant and then, before he can stop it, gentle fingers are tilting Shouto's face up to meet big, concerned eyes. \u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya gasps, fingers dropping again as if he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll hurt Shouto even more. \u201cYour face, Todoroki. What happened?\u201d\nHe can hear the noise behind him die down at the shock in Midoriya\u2019s voice, the upset behind it. \u201cLeave it.\u201d Shouto\u00a0mutters tiredly,\u00a0something close to panic gnawing at his ribs. Midoriya looks like he\u2019s\u00a0wants to argue more but, after he glances to Shouto\u2019s\u00a0neck, his mouth clicks shut, eyes starting to glisten with tears. Shouto knows what the older boy has seen. Small and discreet, nestled near his adams apple, is a black burn left by hell fire.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d Midoriya can\u2019t help but say, reaching out to hold Shouto\u2019s arm. He tenses before the other boy touches though (he doesn\u2019t\u00a0flinch)\u00a0and Midoriya stills again, looking hurt.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Shouto whispers. \u201cLet it go.\u201d He knows Midoriya won\u2019t let it go but he uses the others hesitation as an excuse to jump into the elevator and\u00a0spam the close door button.\n\u201cShouto-\u201d Midoriya calls, voice thick with concern, but the doors shut in the older boy\u2019s face and cut off the rest of his sentence. He doesn\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0to hear the rest of the sentence, anyway. He just wants to get his meeting with Aizawa over with and then -\nWell. Who knows what will happen then.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to tell me who did this to you if you want my help, kid.\u201d Aizawa sounds tired, more tired than Shouto's ever heard him, and frustrated.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Shouto murmurs, not wanting to make his teacher angry but not willing to say any more on the subject either.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologise.\u201d Aizawa sighs. \u201cPlease don\u2019t apologise to me.\u201d\nSorry, Shouto thinks.\nThey were meant to be meeting with Recovery Girl at 09:15 after a short catch up but, after confirming that Shouto wasn\u2019t about to drop dead from internal bleeding, Aizawa had let her know that they\u2019d arrive in their own time.\u00a0Aizawa had decided that getting to the bottom of why Shouto looks like a warmed-up piece of shit was more pressing in the long run.\n\u201cYou live with your father, correct?\u201d Aizawa has a strange look on his face.\u00a0Protective\u00a0his mind supplies. Shouto shoves that thought away harshly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYour father, Endeavor. The number one hero.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your mother isn't in the picture any longer, right?\"\n\u201cNot anymore, no.\u201d Shouto\u00a0chews on\u00a0his bottom lip, trying his best to appear unaffected by Aizawa's new route of questioning. He's tired of being so confused though, fed up of having to overthink and second guess everything that happens. \u201cWhy are we talking about my parents, Aizawa-sensei?\u201d\n\u201cI think you know why.\u201d Aizawa says in a softer tone. It\u2019s still gruff, similar to the voice he uses in class, but there\u2019s an underlying sense of softness to it now. \u201cShouto,\" his name sounds gentle on\u00a0his teachers lips and it makes their conversation more personal, makes it more real. \"You realise I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t say anything?\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d he replies honestly, watching as Aizawa runs a frustrated hand through his hair.\n\u201cBut you still won\u2019t say anything?\u201d\nShouto shakes his head, eyes diverting back down to the desk.\n\u201cI could open up a child abuse case regardless.\u201d Aizawa says after a moments silence, making him tense up. \u201cPeople will recognise the burns on you as ones left by hell fire. We could take photos as proof. You wouldn\u2019t have to go home again if you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d\nHis shoulders hunch more at his teachers\u2019 words. He feels sick just thinking about admitting to everything his father's done. Shouto's not been the only one affected by his father\u2019s hatred and to admit what's happened to him is to admit what's happened to them as well. To his mother. To his siblings. To their family. He isn't sure if he can do it, isn't sure if he wants to do it, but a small part of him lights up at his teachers\u2019 words. The small flame of hope that catches whenever he thinks that his classmates care, that wants Shouto to ask for help, that burns bright in hope that Midoriya doesn\u2019t regret his offer of friendship, swells at the thought of never having to go back to his family house. At never having to go back to his father.\nIt's such a surreal offer\u00a0that it leaves him dazed, leaves him feeling like he's watching the conversation from above. Shouto is so tired of pretending, so tired of lying and being afraid, that he finds himself saying,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019d be angry.\u201d before he can quite register it.\u00a0And then, when Aizawa gives him a look that hints that he\u00a0understands,\u00a0that he thinks Shouto is doing the right thing, the words are spilling before he can stop it. \u201cHe doesn't mean to do it, not really. He\u2019s helping me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Aizawa stops him. \u201cThis, the hurting you - that isn\u2019t help, Shouto. That\u2019s abuse.\u201d\n\nAbuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Shouto denies. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn't have to handle it,\u201d Aizawa presses. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to offer you. I want to help, Shouto.\u201d He pauses and taps the desk until Todoroki meets his eyes again, holding his gaze like he needs Shouto to look at him for this, needs to see for himself that Shouto is registering the words. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, do you hear me?\u00a0You\u2019re a really good kid, Shouto. I don\u2019t like seeing you like this. I don\u2019t like seeing you how you were on Monday which -\u201d he pauses then, eyes widening as he puts the pieces together, letting out a sigh. \u201cWhich only occurred because I said you were\u00a0all heading home, right?\nShouto presses his lips together and shrugs his shoulders.\n\u201cI want to help you, Shouto.\u201d The sentiment is unfamiliar, the phrasing sounding odd and surreal to his ears because Shouto has never considered himself in need of saving.\u00a0No, he corrects himself. Shouto has never thought of himself as someone\u00a0worthy\u00a0of being saved, not from his father.\n(\u201cIt\u2019s unsightly. I can\u2019t look at him.\u201d)\nShouto wasn\u2019t meant to be saved. He was born a monster, is the spawn of one, and he was\u00a0created to be the best and to be nothing else-\n(\u201cYou\u2019ll ruin him, you stupid woman. He needs to learn how to use his Quirk and this is the only way to teach him.\u201d)\n-regardless of what Midoriya tells him, regardless of what Aizawa is trying to tell him. He\u2019s his father's son and their blood runs bad, -\n(\u201cMom?\u201d The kitchen wall presses into his back and he feels cornered, feels scared, as his mom lifts the kettle from the top of the stove.)\n-runs thick and heavy like poison through his veins. His life-\n(\u201cThat\u2019s not your life anymore Shouto. Remember that. You were created to become the number one hero, do you understand?\u201d)\n-was forfeited the second his Quirk appeared, was forfeited when his father grew a sickly interest in him. To think that he, Todoroki Shouto, could be saved, could be worthy of being saved, after\u00a0everything is -\n(Shouto presses his cheek to the floor, chest heaving and muscles spasming, and thinks,\u00a0would it be such a bad thing to be killed?)\n-something like a dream. It\u2019s laughable and it makes him feel so sick and yet so -\nRelieved, maybe.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t want it, though. I\u2019ll need you to be honest with me, Todoroki.\u201d\nHonest about his life, honest about the secret he drowned in a long, long time ago.\nShouto is so,\u00a0so\u00a0tired.\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d\u00a0he breathes, lungs pressing into his brittle ribs. \u201cI float.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDissociative disorder. A state of mind where you disconnect from the world around you. There are many types, the pamphlet tells him. Recovery Girl\u00a0says that it he experiences two types of dissociative states commonly: depersonalisation and dissociative amnesia.\nHe\u2019s not broken,\u00a0she tells him, and he definitely isn\u2019t crazy.\nThe disorder can be caused by a traumatic event or a series of them. Shouto thinks that his childhood could be described as traumatic, but he doesn\u2019t want to admit to it, which, as it turns out, is understandable, is fine even, because he\u2019ll supposedly end up telling the therapist he now has to see twice a week.\nAfter evidence of his injuries was taken and Recovery Girl had healed him, leaving him to rest in the bed for a while, Aizawa asked again if this is what Shouto wanted. After he'd gained Shouto's approval there was a brief discussion between Aizawa, Recovery Girl, and president Nezu over how they should proceed with both Shouto\u2019s mental state and home life.\nShouto finds himself tuning in and out of the conversation, shaky fingers clutching the pamphlets he was given to his chest, but gathers enough to know that, if Aizawa is willing to take temporary guardianship and responsibility of him, Shouto will be allowed to stay at Yuuei to train. The relief is overwhelming but is quickly drowned out by more nerves, more questions piling on his tongue that he bites back.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d Aizawa pauses then, voice growing firmer. \u201cBut only if that\u2019s what Shouto wants.\u201d\nBecause Shouto\u2019s opinion on the situation did matter, it would seem. He\u2019s asked more questions then, ones he tries his best to answer honestly, no matter how difficult he finds them. There\u2019s a break for lunch and then the child welfare officers are there to speak to him.\nIt's all happening too quickly but he\u2019s reassured that it's only because they don\u2019t want to worsen his mental state by delaying this meeting for another day.\n(They don't want to give him the time to change his mind on the matter.)\nBy the end of the day Shouto is physically and mentally exhausted.\nHe feels - not better, no, but more settled then he has in a long time.\nAizawa walks him back to the dorms, voice still oddly soft as he chats idly about what\u2019s going to happen next. Shouto didn't take Aizawa as one to ramble but he finds the act soothing. \u201cThere will be more meetings of course, but I can be there if needed. I\u2019d also rather you didn\u2019t partake in the bigger practical lessons for now, but I\u2019m happy to arrange private lessons so that you don\u2019t fall behind in class.\u201d\n\u201cMy father?\u201d Shouto asks quietly, breath fogging in the\u00a0cold night\u00a0air. \u201cWhat will happen\u00a0to him?\u201d\n\u201cThe child welfare officers will need to write up their reports before speaking to the police. That'll take a few days, I imagine. Your father won\u2019t know anything until there\u2019s enough evidence to convict him, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouto repeats. He can\u2019t quite believe what's happened today and he's\u00a0tempted to write the whole thing off as a dream, a different life that isn\u2019t his own, but he lets the sound of Aizawa\u2019s voice ground him and fights against the temptation.\nThey both pause\u00a0when they reach the dorms and Aizawa\u00a0shifts\u00a0so that his left arm is pressed up against Shouto\u2019s briefly. It\u2019s not a hug, not even close, but he finds the motion comforting, finds it nice. \u201cThank you, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d Shouto bows, wanting to show the other man's kindness as much respect as he can, knowing he'll never find the words to do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Shouto.\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cYou have my number, yeah?\u201d He waits for Shouto to nod before he continues. \u201cGood. Call me if you need anything, okay? And I really do mean anything. I\u2019m here to help.\u201d Aizawa nudges their arms together again before he makes a move to leave. \u201cGet out of the cold, kid. Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve done the right thing - You\u2019re a good boy, Shouto.\u201d\nA good boy\u00a0isn\u2019t something Shouto\u2019s ever been called but it makes him feel soft and warm and safe.\nHe scans his ID badge before walking into the dorms, surprised to see people are still milling about downstairs. When he takes note of who it is though his surprise melts into that same soft feeling he felt outside and his cheeks flush slightly.\nIida, Kirishima, Jirou and Uraraka are sitting around a table playing a board game, faces animated and voices loud and happy, whilst Midoriya and Kaminari cheer them on. Ashido is sitting with Yaoyorozu and Hagakure in the living area, seemingly having a more private conversation, voices hushed as they lean in towards each other. The dorm smells of cake, no doubt Sato\u2019s doing, and Aoyama\u2019s fruit scented candles - familiar, warm, and homely. He feels like he hasn't appreciated the rooms here enough, feels like he's been taking his life here for granted. The comforting layout gives his tired mind some peace and, as he takes in the chatter and motions around him, he sees the dorms in a new light.\nHe\u2019s never known what\u00a0family\u00a0is, not really. The relationship Shouto has with Fuyumi is the closest thing he\u2019s ever known but even that\u2019s built on blood-soaked sands with boiling seas. He never thought that he could find a semblance of family within Yuuei, never thought that he\u2019d be able to make friends after being\u00a0alone so many years but looking around the dorm he feels - warm. Calm.\nHis brain doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s in as many pieces at the moment, thoughts clear and his surroundings seeming solid, and he stands in the doorway just taking it all in.\nMidoriya spots him not even a minute later, unsurprisingly.\nHe\u2019s letting out an excited whoop at something Uraraka's done when he catches Shouto\u2019s eyes, freezing mid fist pump to stare at him.\nHe's handsome, Shouto thinks absently, staring at his green messy hair and increasingly muscled body. Midoriya's jaw has grown stronger over the past year and most of the puppy fat has fallen away from his face, leaving it more chiselled. His nose is upturned, and his lips are a pretty pink, complementary to the freckles on his cheeks, and he's everything Shouto never imagined he'd have in his life.\u00a0\nHis green eyes are anxious as they rove over his body and Shouto remembers their earlier interaction, Midoriya being the only one to physically see the damage done by his father up close. It feels like it was weeks ago and Shouto\u00a0thinks that today may just be the longest day in his life after the day his mother was taken to the hospital.\nAny thought about his mother would usually make some kind of cloud gather in the back of his mind but nothing happens, brain fuzzy from nothing but his tiredness. He\u2019s probably too exhausted for him to float he knows, especially after such a draining day, but he allows himself to hope that taking\u00a0a step forward to right his past - to right his future - has helped, too.\nHe offers Midoriya a tired smile, eyelids drooping slightly, and can\u2019t help but drop his gaze when Midoriya gives him a blinding grin in return. Shouto isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s done to earn such affection, such kindness, but he doesn't push Midoriya off when he makes his way over to pull Shouto into a hug, this one more gentle then the one he received earlier but no less warm. Shouto\u2019s usual reaction to being hugged\u00a0is tensing up, standing stiffly, and not knowing what to do in return whilst his brain short circuits. This time though he lets himself sag into Midoriya, knowing that the smaller boy is more than strong enough to take on some of his weight, and he presses his face into his warm neck.\u00a0Shouto sniffs slightly, tired and drained and yet still so emotional over\u00a0everything,\u00a0and Midoriya tightens his hold, helping ground Shouto even more.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Midoriya asks quietly, pulling back to take in Shouto\u2019s face again. He, much like Aizawa, waits for Shouto to nod before he continues. \u201cYou were gone all day. We were all pretty worried, especially after my, uh, not so subtle reaction this morning.\u201d\n\u201cI had to sort some stuff out.\u201d He lets Midoriya take his hand and lead him over towards the kitchen.\n\u201cNot like, killing anyone, right?\u201d Midoriya pulls a few bowls out of the fridge and places them in the microwave. \u201cBecause after seeing you\u00a0this morning\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t blame you, but I\u2019d like to think you\u2019d invite me along to kill whoever did that to you. I would\u2019ve come too, you realise? I can\u2019t believe someone would do that to you Shouto, especially after everything you\u2019ve been through. You deserve better than-\u201d\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d The name feels nice on his lips in the way his fathers never had. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill-\u201d he hesitates, but then shakes it off, knowing Midoriya knows half of the truth anyway. \u201c-my father.\u201d his voice comes out shakier then he intends but Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem to think any less of him for it. He comes over to place a gentle hand on his shoulder instead, squeezing it in comfort.\n\u201cI guessed it was your dad.\u201d He says quietly, hand reaching up to fiddle with Shouto\u2019s hair. It\u2019s a weird feeling and such an easy affection but it makes Shouto feel like he might cry. Nobody before Yuuei has ever treated him this gently - this kindly. Not since his mother. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to presume, you know? Did you tell Aizawa-sensei?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto admits, letting his eyes fall shut to the hide the tears welling in them. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Midoriya tugs lightly on a strand of hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad, Shouto-kun.\u201d\nShouto thinks that he may be glad too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOne month later\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo say that Shouto was better would be a lie.\nTo say that\u00a0things\u00a0were better would be a half truth.\nTo say that everything would be okay is the only thing he can be certain about. It\u2019s one of the only things he\u2019s ever been certain about.\nOkay\u00a0\u2013 a distant dream, something so unbelievable and otherworldly that Shouto knows he\u2019ll never find it in this lifetime. It\u2019s a phrase that\u2019s so commonly used by everyone around him, a passing word, a passing emotion, but it\u2019s one Shouto will never be able to understand.\nThings have never been okay, even before his Quirk. Things will never be okay, even after this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Todoroki.\u201d The woman - someone different to the lady who he was meeting with yesterday - says from his left. Across the table from them sit his father's lawyers, more lavish and expensive than the ones that had been assigned to his case. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got us in a corner here.\u201d\n\u201cIn a corner?\u201d Aizawa spits. He sits on Todoroki\u2019s other side and seems to be one of the only people fighting for him completely. It makes him feel - soft, maybe. Warm. Or it had, until today.\nNow all Shouto feels is stupid. Stupid, angry, disappointed, and yet a part of him isn\u2019t even surprised. A part of him knew that this could be the outcome \u2013 that this was\u00a0always\u00a0going to be the outcome.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t press charges, not against Endeavor. It\u2019s not feasible and, without proof, we can\u2019t take him to court for how he chooses to deal with private family affairs.\u201d\n\u201cWe have proof.\u201d Aizawa snaps. \u201cWe have evidence of Shouto with hell fire burns. What\u2019s not convicting about that?\u201d\n\u201cAizawa.\u201d One of his father's lawyers says in a polite tone. \u201cPlease understand that what happened between our client and his son was a terrible accident, one he\u2019s already apologised for.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t burn your child on accident.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s words make Todoroki flinch for more reason then one.\n(\u201cYou need to let me see,\u201d Fuyumi begs, hands tugging more insistently on his arm.\nShouto shakes his head, panting and wheezing and curling up even tighter because he\u00a0can\u2019t. He can\u2019t take his hand away, doesn\u2019t want to take it away. He doesn\u2019t want to know what lies underneath his palm.\nHe presses his hand against his face even harder in the hopes that the pressure will stop the pain, the burning agony of his skin disappearing, but he\u2019s not strong enough to stop his sister as she pulls harder, as she pulls his hand upwards instead of down.)\n(Shouto\u2019s only ever seen his sister cry once in his life and it blurs into his worst memory, a mare contributing factor to the horror he had felt. His sister had cried, hand cold on his left arm, hitching breaths echoing and blurring into the sound of his father shouting, his mother screaming, his brothers frantic voice on the phone. It was in the mess of that moment that Shouto had stopped his own pained keens, had stopped trying to let out any noise, and had instead retreated into the darkness his mind offered him.)\n\u201cIt was an incident between Enji and Shouto alone, I\u2019d like to remind you. Until you can get evidence of this...\u00a0Abuse,\u201d the woman's voice grows amused at that word, as if the thought of Endeavor abusing anyone was a joke, \u201cthen I\u2019m afraid that this case is closed.\u201d\nAizawa opens his mouth to argue, to snap something else, but deep down has Shouto always known that it\u2019d end this way. \u201cThank you for your time.\u201d he says politely, pushing his chair back and standing up numbly. \u201cTell my father that he doesn't need to bother with sending you here anymore. I'll drop my claims.\u201d\nShouto walks out the room then, ignoring Aizawa\u2019s voice as it calls his name and the sound of President Nezu speaking in a calmer tone. He lets his feet carry him away from the classroom and away from the mess he\u2019s left inside, lets himself shake as he heads through empty corridors towards the exit.\nOutside the air is cold and bitter, winter still upon them, and Shouto practises the breathing techniques his therapist had taught him as he makes his way behind the Yuuei building.\nWhen he\u2019s in an area he knows nobody ever comes to, somewhere quiet and empty, he lets his knees give out.\nSlumping down against the wall hurts, his fall too rough and the brick scraping his skin, but once he\u2019s sitting he can\u2019t bring himself to care about anything, can barely force himself to keep his breathing nice and even, in for three and out for three.\nThe sun is setting, and the air is cold, and Shouto presses his face into his knees as his body shakes.\nHis father had denied Shouto\u2019s claims. The police couldn\u2019t build up enough evidence from just the burns and Shouto\u2019s story alone and when they\u2019d brought in his bastard of a father for questioning he\u2019d denied it all.\nHe had denied everything.\nShouto\u2019s story was: years of abuse, of hurting and training, of loneliness and isolation. A family ruined by a man who was always too caught up in himself to see that he was killing them all piece by piece, shattering and burning them all into nothing.\nHis father\u2019s story was: Shouto, a rebellious teenager still haunted by his mother's betrayal. Shouto, young and angry, who got into a fight with his father, Endeavor, the number one hero, one that ended on bad terms. One that Endeavor was sorry about, one that Endeavor just wants them to forget about and move on from.\nShouto\u2019s word versus the word of a hero.\n(\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be a hero anymore, Shouto?\u201d his mother\u2019s voice is disappointed but kind, almost understanding, and Shouto sniffs wetly into her shoulder.\nThe sight of his father, one of the biggest hero\u2019s out there, smacking his mother so hard she fell to the floor comes to mind. She\u2019d cracked her head on the tiles and had to go to hospital. Shouto had been locked in his part of the house, shut away in his room, crying and begging to know if his mother was okay, if she was coming back, if anyone was there.\nShouto had never been more afraid of the word hero then in that moment, has never been able to look at other heroes without thinking\u00a0do you hurt the people you love too?)\nHe can\u2019t even let himself cry.\nHe\u2019s been close many time, eyes watering and breath stuttering, but to let it out, to actually cry and grieve for everything (for everyone) was something he was trained out of by age seven. Crying is a weakness, is a flaw, and even though people are telling him otherwise, he can\u2019t help but believe what he was taught. He can\u2019t help but stick to what he\u2019s always known.\nShouto knows that crying ends in punishments. None of his other sibling\u2019s cry, not that he knows of, and it\u2019s messed up, supposedly, but it\u2019s also the life that he knows.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d All Might\u2019s voice startles him, makes him tense up even more, forehead pressing more firmly into his bony knees.\nHe refuses to look up. He can\u2019t see All Might right now, doesn\u2019t want All Might to see him right now, not after everything. There hasn\u2019t been an opportunity for him to say sorry yet and the thought of what he did, of what he could\u2019ve done, makes him feel sick.\nIf anything, All Might finding him may be the worst possible outcome to his day.\nHe knew his father would worm his way out of it, knew what to expect, but this?\nAll Might is someone he\u2019s heard of all his life, someone who his father told him to defeat and someone who his mother encouraged him to look up to. For All Might, for the one man Shouto holds such tormented and twisted feelings towards, to find him like this, shaking and alone, is pathetic.\nHe must look so,\u00a0so\u00a0pathetic.\nThere\u2019s the sound of someone sitting next to him, fabric shifting and gravel crunching, and when he peeks to the side he sees All Might, skinny and hollow in comparison to who he once was, mirroring Shouto\u2019s position against the wall a few feet away.\nThe ex-hero looks tired and run down, a bit like how Shouto feels, and oddly vulnerable with his knees pulled to his chest and head resting on his crossed arms. He isn\u2019t looking at Shouto, eyes staring ahead listlessly, which is for the best. Shouto doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019d cope if All Might looked at him, if they were both to stare at each other and see too much.\n\u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d All Might says, breath fogging out in front of him. \u201cI was born Quirkless.\u201d\nTodoroki tenses at this admission, unsure what to do with the information.\n\u201cI still wanted to be a hero, regardless of my lack of Quirk,\u201d All Might continues. \u201cand I had to fight for what I wanted. I won\u2019t tell you how I got my Quirk, young Todoroki, but I will tell you this much: To go from being a nobody to being the number one hero was humbling. It was a dream come true and I\u2019ve always tried my best to be loyal to what I believe in, to stay true to who I am. All I've ever wanted to do\u00a0is help people, to save them, and to become a symbol of hope was so honouring.\u201d\nShouto watches as All Might shudders slightly, arms tightening around his legs. \u201cTo know,\u201d he pauses, eyes clouded as they stare out to the sparse scattering of trees in front of them. \u201cThat somebody could hold so much resentment towards me. So much hatred.\u201d\nShouto blinks, lips pressing together. Despite everything, Shouto can understand where All Might is coming from, can relate to what the older man must be feeling on a all too familiar level. To know his father could break their family and then deny it when Shouto finally had a chance to be free, when he finally dared breathe word of the horror he\u2019d lived through, is a level of hatred he never thought his father would sink to.\nTo sit in that room with the expensive lawyers looking at him like he\u2019s nothing but an attention seeking brat, nothing but an annoyance, and to hear them deny everything, hurt him. It\u2019s only the start, he knows. His father won\u2019t let this slide, can\u2019t let the truth stay out there, and the world blurs slightly when Shouto thinks of the future.\n\u201cIf I had known, my boy.\u201d All Might lets out a humourless laugh. \u201cIf I had only known then I would\u2019ve-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Shouto breathes, letting his eyes flutter shut and turning his face back into his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. Just.\u201d\u00a0In for three, out for three.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not.\u201d All Might agrees after a moments silence. \u201cBut it\u2019s not your fault either, you realise?\u201d\nShouto bites back a snort. It may not be entirely his fault, he knows, but Shouto\u2019s birth was still the catalyst of his family falling apart. Maybe people from the outside think they can see otherwise, but Shouto knows that somebody has to be blamed. That they are all to be blamed, maybe.\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d All Might says when the silence stretches out between them. He sounds like he wants to press the matter more, sounds like he wants to jump onto the\u00a0you're a good person Shouto\u00a0band wagon, but what comes out of his mouth instead is, \u201cpeople are looking for you.\u201d\nTo go from a life of isolation to a life where Shouto can\u2019t even take an hour to himself without people needing to know his whereabouts is exhausting. He knows he shouldn\u2019t have walked out, that he should\u2019ve just told somebody where he was going, but he just needed the space. He considers trying to tell All Might that, lets the sentences string together in his mouth, but changes his mind just before they bloom into existence.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to call me Todoroki.\u201d It comes out smaller then he wanted, less demanding and more desperate. \u201cThat\u2019s his name.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d All Might hums, gravel scraping as he shifts next to him. \u201cI'm sorry about the outcome from the meeting you were in- Aizawa told me what happened.\u201d and then, the words jarring and still unfamiliar. \u201cHe's worried about you.\u201d\nThe outcome of the meeting: Todoroki Shouto, problem child of Todoroki Enji, troubled and rebellious and a liar. A Todoroki, true and through. The biggest project his father has ever committed himself to, the project that\u2019s run his mouth to his teachers and has left Endeavor with no other option but to lie himself.\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m lying.\u201d Shouto slumps further against the wall, lifting his head and letting it thunk back against the brick. Night is fast approaching them, the last beams of the day shining weakly through the trees. \u201cThey say he said sorry.\u201d\n\u201cShouto,\u201d His name coming from All Might\u2019s mouth would have been enough to make him glance over in itself, but the tone he says it in as well, something gentle and commanding, makes his head twist and his fingers twitch. All Might is staring back at him with hollowed cheeks and pale skin and Shouto still hasn\u2019t said sorry to him. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a space in chest, a gap where his heart feels both gorged out and too big for his rib cage, and he finds himself struggling to breathe.\nAll Might\u2019s words offer no room for argument, leave no hint of doubt, and to stare into the face of the man whose presence both terrifies him and fills him with hope makes him feel \u2013\n(\u201cDon\u2019t let your emotions control you.\u201d His father lectures. \u201cYou can\u2019t help your emotions, Shouto, but you can learn to control them and not the other way around, okay? If you feel like you\u2019re going to cry, then you stop yourself. Don\u2019t ever appear weak, especially not in front of your enemies.\u201d\nShouto frowns down at the notebook he\u2019s writing in, trying his best to keep up with what he\u2019s being told.\n\nThings to do:\n\n\nThings not to do:\n\n\u201cYour mother has always been too soft on you,\u201d his father continues. \u201cBut with her gone I think we can finally start to make some solid progress.\u201d\nHe blinks back the burning feeling at the reminder of his mother, eyes trained on\u00a0Things not to do: cry.\nHe misses her.)\n\u201cYou with me?\u201d All Might\u2019s words sound distant but Shouto nods, not wanting the other man to worry.\nThere is hand on his shoulder, All Might\u2019s hand, and he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He breathes, forcing the burning feeling in his eyes away. \u201cFor what I did during class. I shouldn\u2019t have lost control.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, my boy.\u201d The hand squeezes, kind and gentle, and yet something in Shouto still feels like he should flinch away. \u201cDon\u2019t get stuck on what happened then. I\u2019ve long forgiven you \u2013 I never even blamed you, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve died if Aizawa-sensei hadn\u2019t stepped in.\u201d Shouto points out.\n\u201cHe did step in, though.\u201d All might squeezes his shoulder. \u201cThere was no damage done to me. If anything, I should apologise for not seeing Endeavor for what he was sooner.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Shouto repeats, bitter and empty. \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d All Might agrees, stretching his legs. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to say it today. We probably do have to go in, though, Shouto. People are worried.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Shouto sighs, letting his head thud against the wall again and staring up at where the sky is a gradient of red and dark blue. His shaking has died down, mind calmed slightly by All Might\u2019s presence and his clarity. His honesty.\nShouto is just tired now.\n\u201cBut worry they will.\u201d All Might pushes himself to his feet and, when Shouto makes no move to stand, offers a hand to help pull him up.\nShouto stares at the offered appendage, at the skinny fingers and clean cut nails, at the hand of the hero he\u2019s always looked up to. He takes it in his right one, All Might\u2019s skin feeling oddly hot against his cold side, and terrifyingly normal. Although they\u2019re all hero\u2019s, Shouto sometimes forgets that underneath it all they're just human, that under the hulking presence of All Might has always just been a man.\nAll Might smiles, small and genuine, and Shouto\u2019s lips want to twitch in return. \u201cThank you All Might.\u201d he murmurs, looking down to the floor.\n\u201cCall me Toshinori,\u201d All Might returns. \u201cAll Might isn\u2019t who I am anymore. Let me, Toshinori Yagi, help you as I am, Shouto.\u201d\nThere\u2019s probably more to this than meets the eye, underlying tales and buried sentiments hidden in the offering, but Shouto doesn\u2019t want to look into them. Instead he takes a breath and steels himself before murmuring, \u201cthank you, Toshinori-sensei.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey must have been outside for longer than Shouto expected because when he enters the dorms, All Might by his side, Midoriya looks near tears and Aizawa\u2019s hair is messier than usual, as if he\u2019s been running his hands through it. Most of the class are still up, piled onto the common area couches, and the air seems to be buzzing slightly.\nSilence falls upon everyone when the door clicks shut behind them and it makes him feel anxious, makes his mind feel jittery, and if he were to let it, Shouto imagines he could take a step back into the looming fog and leave his body to cope with the aftermath of his disappearance.\nIt\u2019s tempting, especially when Aizawa starts to walk over with purpose, but he\u2019s been trying so hard to break out of it. His therapist has taught him techniques, has taught him about grounding and not running away from his problems, and he wants to try to be better. He wants to be better.\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Aizawa\u2019s face is neutral but Shouto\u2019s spent enough time around his teacher recently to see the telltale signs of stress and worry. Aizawa\u2019s eyes are slightly more bloodshot then usual and his lips are pinched, eyebrows more furrowed. \u201cAlright?\u201d he asks, both of them very aware of the rest of the class listening in.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto says quietly, bowing his head in silent apology. \u201cI just needed to \u2013 you know.\u201d\n\u201cI can imagine.\u201d Aizawa says and Shouto knows that Aizawa\u00a0can\u00a0imagine. He knows that Aizawa understands him on a different level, on a similar level, and it\u2019s for this reason only that Shouto\u2019s been able to trust his teacher so much. Even with what his father is saying, Aizawa is on his side without question, without doubt.\n\u201cWe can speak more about everything tomorrow, can we not?\u201d All Might -\u00a0call me Toshinori\u00a0- pipes up, hovering a hand over Shouto\u2019s back. He doesn\u2019t touch which Shouto is grateful for, and the heat radiating from it is - nice, maybe. Reassuring.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Aizawa agrees, eyes flicking between them both. \u201cTomorrow morning, before class. That okay with you, kid?\u201d\n\u201cYes sensei.\u201d Shouto agrees, relieved to have the rest of the evening to himself. Or as to himself as he can get with everyone else waiting to talk to him.\nOnly a few people from his class know what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s really going on, but everybody knows on some level that Shouto is having... Issues.\n\u201cEnjoy the rest of your day, Shouto.\u201d Toshinori says. Shouto takes this as his queue to walk further into the dorms and Midoriya takes it as his queue to come padding over to Shouto, eyes big and worried as they scan him as if Shouto\u2019s been held hostage for the past few hours instead of in a meeting about his father.\nHe pretends not to hear Aizawa hiss to Toshinori\u00a0\u201cyou could have let any of us know that you found him. I\u2019ve got at least half the staff out there looking for him and you\u2019ve just waltzed in-\u201d\n\u201cShouto-kun.\u201d Midoriya greets with a small smile, eyes swimming with unasked questions.\n\u201cMidoriya-San.\u201d Shouto returns, eyelids feeling heavy and body weighted. Midoriya looks like he wants to say more, looks like he wants to pry Shouto apart with his kindness and worry, to ask what happened, what is happening, but he doesn't. He looks Shouto over, head tilted, before he tuts and steers him towards the kitchen instead. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop missing dinner, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI do it on purpose.\u201d Shouto mutters sarcastically. He feels tired - upset. Disappointed.\u00a0You\u2019re allowed to be upset,\u00a0he reminds himself.\u00a0You\u2019re allowed to be sad about the outcome of the meeting.\u00a0Midoriya is offering him an out though, is offering him normality in the face of everything else he feels. \u201cI love having the entire kitchen to myself, you see.\u201d\n\u201cYou never have it just to yourself.\u201d Bakugou scoffs when they walk in. \u201cDeku is like your second fucking shadow.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, the kitchen is the place to be.\u201d Kirishima pipes up from where he\u2019s sitting at the table watching Bakugou cook. \u201cThere\u2019s always so much free food. Who ever knew that Bakugou-san was such a chef!\u201d\n\u201cCall me a fucking chef one more time, Shitty Hair, and I\u2019ll fucking blast this rice so far up your-\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Iida gasps as he walks in behind Shouto and Midoriya. \u201cKeep your kinks out of the kitchen. This is where we eat, you animals.\u201d\nUraraka, also trailing in alongside them, takes a seat next to Shouto with a snort as Bakugou splutters and Kirishima howls at\u00a0your face, man, oh my god.\n\u201cAre you making enough to share, Bakugou?\u201d Midoriya interrupts Bakugou\u2019s cursing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking sharing with any of you.\u201d Bakugou snaps, slamming a wooden spoon down on the kitchen counter. \u201cYou can all fucking cook for yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Uraraka says, voice bubbly and sweet. \u201cYou and Deku can share both kitchen space\u00a0and\u00a0ingredients then, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima says delightedly. \u201cYou can have a cook off!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not having a cook off,\u201d Bakugou snarls. \u201cDeku can\u2019t cook for fucking shit anyway, and there\u2019s no fucking way he\u2019s touching my ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank god they\u2019re the dorm ingredients then, right?\u201d Iida says, picking up a bag of beef from the counter and twisting it from side to side.\n\u201cPut that down.\u201d Bakugou snaps, eyes wide as Midoriya makes his way over to inspect the beef alongside Iida. \u201cStay the fuck out of my kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you suggest this be cooked, Midoriya-san?\u201d Iida continues over the top of Bakugou.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Midoriya frowns thoughtfully, tapping his chin in an over exaggerated manner of thinking. Shouto watches the way a vein pops in Bakugou\u2019s forehead with amusement. \u201cI\u2019d say about fifteen minutes in the oven.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bakugou snaps, seemingly at his breaking point. He walks over to snatch the beef out of Iida\u2019s hands and cradles it to his chest. \u201cThis beef needs to be seasoned and fried, you fucking idiots.\u201d\n\u201cThe oven sounds fine to me.\u201d Shouto says, unable to help himself when it comes to pressing Bakugou\u2019s buttons.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Uraraka agrees. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d put it in for thirty minutes just to be safe that it's cooked all the way through.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder whose beef will taste the best.\u201d Kirishima ponders aloud. \u201cI\u2019ll have to taste both, of course-\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d Bakugou snarls, empty hand releasing a small controlled\u00a0bang. \u201cFucking fine, you fucking parasites, I get it. I\u2019ll fucking make enough so that Icy Hot can have a meal.\u201d\n\u201cJust Shouto-kun?\u201d Kirishima seems unable to help himself.\nAnother frustrated explosion comes from Bakugou\u2019s hand as he closes his eyes and breathes deeply, the action oddly reminiscent of the breathing techniques Shouto\u2019s therapist has been teaching him. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking plate up for me and the Half and Half bastard-\u201d\n\u201cAnd me, right?\u201d Kirishima pouts.\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Bakugou continues through gritted teeth. \u201cFor fucking Hair for Brains. Whatever is left over can be shared amongst the rest of you idiots.\u201d\n\u201cSo kind, Bakugou-san!\u201d Uraraka gushes.\n\u201cSo noble.\u201d Iida says in a serious tone, taking a seat opposite Shouto at the table, lips twitching when they share a glance. \u201cTruly, your kindness knows no bounds.\u201d\n\u201cI fucking hate all of you.\u201d Bakugou snarls, twisting back around to continue cooking.\nShouto lets the chatter around the table wash over him, lets himself get distracted by the conversations, by the words. It\u2019s nice to be around people, he finds. Sometimes it can be too much, but often it's nice to just surround himself with bigger, brighter presences. He forces himself to focus on their individual voices, on their separate ways of interacting, and tries to observe how they act around each other. It\u2019s nice to sit back and watch, knowing that if he wants to join in he can, but also knowing that if he doesn\u2019t say a word, that\u2019ll be okay too.\n(Shouto can hear his siblings, sometimes.\nHe doesn\u2019t see them, hasn\u2019t seen them for so very long, but their voices echo through the walls of the house like they\u2019re haunting it.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d His father snaps, grabbing his arm and yanking him away from the wall he was sitting against. On the other side is Fuyumi, her soft voice cutting off abruptly at their father\u2019s arrival. She had been talking about her day, her week, but now it\u2019s like she was never there, his father's grip crushing her ghostly presence as well as Shouto\u2019s arm.\nShouto is locked in a different part of the house to her but they\u2019ve learnt that the upstairs hallway on his side interconnects with a closet on Fuyumi\u2019s side and so they meet here, quiet and private, and Shouto listens to his sister talk and she pretends she doesn\u2019t hear him cry.\nIt\u2019s worth it in the long run, the sneaking around. They only resort to this when Shouto is desperate and lonely and Fuyumi is willing to chance getting in trouble, but the snatches of time they\u00a0have is everything to him.)\nHe blinks when a plate is placed in front of him, jostled away from the grainy memories by the smell of beef and garlic rice. Looking up it\u2019s to see Bakugou frowning at him, lips moving but words seeming far away. He blinks again and Bakugou is gone, Midoriya now sitting next to him, eyes big and kind as they stare at him.\nEat up\u00a0his mouth says.\u00a0Before Bakugou changes his mind and takes the food back.\nShouto does as told, eats the meal in front of him on autopilot and keeps his eyes trained on his plate. Things seem blurry around him as if he\u2019s suddenly watching his life through a film instead of being there. It\u2019s disorientating, and he tries to remember what he was told to do when he started to float but his mind comes up blank.\nHe remembers meeting with his therapist, remembers the room and the colour of the walls, but the things they spoke about are non-existent.\nNon-existent.\nNot existing.\nNothing being real and -\n(would it be such a bad thing--)\nThere\u2019s a foot touching his under the table. It presses down firmly, a heavy weight that could almost hurt, and Shouto takes the breath he\u2019d forgotten about.\nIn for three, out for three. Repeat.\nWith air in his lungs he allows one hand to curl, allows his nails to bite into his palm as the voices around him start to drain back in.\nMidoriya isn\u2019t looking at him when Shouto glances over. The other boy is instead joining in with everyone else, laughing at something Uraraka has said. His foot though is warm and heavy atop of Shouto\u2019s own and it makes the winds inside of his head die down, makes sitting here with everyone easier.\n\u201cHow was your meeting, Shouto-kun?\u201d Kirishima asks when there\u2019s a lull in the conversation, Midoriya\u2019s foot still grounding him to the room.\nHe\u2019s not surprised that the subject has been brought up. Everybody must be curious about the meeting, about why he disappeared for an hour after it.\nIf anything, Shouto's more surprised over how long it took for the topic to come up in their conversation.\n(\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Todoroki, but they\u2019ve got us in a corner here.\u201d)\n(\u201cUntil you can get evidence of this\u00a0abuse, then I\u2019m afraid that this case is closed.\u201d)\nMidoriya is the only one Shouto has admitted anything to, the only one who\u2019s ever seen the unfiltered aftermath of his father, but Shouto knows that Bakugou overheard their conversation all those months ago at the sports festival. He knows that Kirishima has been keeping a close eye on him, especially after he came back from his\u00a0family home a few weeks ago, and he often catches the red haired boy watching him when he thinks Shouto isn\u2019t looking. Then there's Iida and Uraraka. Midoriya would never break his trust, would never give away any fine details, but he must have confided his concerns about Shouto to them both, concerns which they already had, it would seem.\nThe whole of 1-A knows about the meetings, knows that something bigger is going on. It\u2019s not easy to hide Aizawa and Shouto disappearing for hours to meet with strangers that have been granted access into Yuuei grounds. It\u2019s not easy to pretend that something didn\u2019t make Shouto snap in class and attack a teacher.\nShouto had thought that his silences and distant gazes went unnoticed, but it\u2019s slowly becoming clear to him that he was the only ignorant one.\nEverybody treats him - not differently. Differently isn't the word he wants to use because 1-A treat him normally, treat him as if he\u2019s not balancing on the edge of crazy, but they\u2019re more observant to him now, maybe. They\u2019re almost protective- if you can be protective over somebody who isn\u2019t really in any danger.\n(\u201cDo you feel safe here?\u201d His therapist asks.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto replies honestly, thinking it over. He\u2019s always felt safe here at Yuuei, at the dorms. \u201cIt\u2019s nice here.\u201d\nHis therapist hums, tucking a strand of long\u00a0hair behind her ear. \u201cDid you feel safe here after one of your peers was kidnapped?\u201d She tilts her head curiously, eyes observant as they watch him.\nHe blinks, confused. \u201cKidnapped?\u201d he asks hesitantly.\nHis therapist pauses, pen hovering above her notebook, before she continues like normal, placing her pen down and staring at him with kind eyes. \u201cYes. Bakugou, during your summer camp. Do you not remember this?\u201d\nHe frowns, trying his best not to panic as he thinks of the event in question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t remember, Shouto.\u201d His therapist reminds him gently. \u201cRepressed memories can be a side effect of dissociation. We're here to work through them, alright?\u201d She gives him an encouraging smile, sweet perfume hanging in the air as she shifts slightly.\u00a0\u201cI imagine the memory was a very traumatic. You were Bakugou\u2019s partner during the time where he was taken.\u201d\nHe was? He tries to recall it, tries to think through summer camp, summer training -\nThe memory is there in the back of his head, blurred and distant, as if it were drawn on sand and the tide had started to wash it away. He remembers Bakugou being taken, remembers Kirishima and him planning to get him back, remembers this being the reason for the dorms to be constructed. There are bits inbetween that are fuzzy, the sea covering patches of sand where something is being explained, but he remembers-\n\u201cI felt safe.\u201d Even when in danger, even when there was so much uncertainty and wariness, he never once felt unsafe.\nTrust is not something Shouto gives easily, but the fine lines of it have been built between him and his classmates. He knew they'd protect each other. \u201cAnywhere is safer than being at home.\u201d)\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell us if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Iida says when Shouto is quiet for what must be too long.\n\u201cYeah, sorry man. Don\u2019t feel like you have to tell, I was just curious-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he interrupts, not wanting to hear Kirishima\u2019s hurried apology. Shouto isn\u2019t fine china, isn\u2019t a bow that's been pulled too tight. He\u2019s just \u2013 him. \u201cIt went okay.\u201d\n\u201cDid it?\u201d Midoriya frowns at him.\n(\u201cAizawa.\u201d One of his father's lawyers says in a polite tone. \u201cPlease understand that what happened between our client and his son was a terrible accident.\u201d)\n\u201cWell,\u201d he pushes the food around his plate, appetite gone and mood spiralling into something dark. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t push him past that, Uraraka smoothly jumping subjects to what he missed out on during his meeting, something about Tokoyami and Jirou arguing. He's grateful for her intervening, the thought of his meeting making him feel sick, making his mind feel hazy-\nMidoriya's foot presses down on his and Shouto reminds himself that he's not alone anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next morning before class finds Shouto sitting in front of Aizawa\u2019s desk.\n\u201cI won\u2019t give up.\u201d Aizawa is saying. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you the outcome, Shouto, but I can promise you I\u2019m not going to stop fighting this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s nice to hear but \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d Shouto knows his father. The man is a liar and a monster, but he\u2019s also dreadfully predictable. Shouto knows what\u2019s coming next, can picture the way his father will go about this, and now the only thing they can do is play a waiting game with the man. \u201cYou heard what the lady on our case said \u2013 what everybody\u00a0who's been\u00a0assigned to our case has said. It\u2019ll be better for us all if you just let it go.\u201d\n\u201cKid, anybody willing to bend over backwards just because the name\u00a0Endeavor\u00a0is involved isn\u2019t worth our time.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice is flat and annoyed but Shouto knows it\u2019s not aimed at him. \u201cThere's going to be someone out there who's willing to fight this case for us, someone who can\u2019t be brought or intimidated by that man.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point.\u201d Shouto repeats. There have been three separate lawyers assigned to his case already and all of them have said the same thing:\u00a0There\u2019s not enough evidence to press charges against Todoroki Enji for years\u2019 worth of child abuse - it\u2019s your word against his and, no offence boy, but. Well, he\u2019s\u00a0Endeavor.\nHis father has always been well known and people don\u2019t want to hear slander against their new symbol of hope, against the man they all believe in now All Might is gone. People aren\u2019t going to believe them and Shouto isn\u2019t surprised, not anymore. He was stupid for getting his hopes up in the first place.\n\u201cThere\u2019s every point.\u201d Aizawa taps on the desk twice, wanting Shouto to look at him. It\u2019s hard to look at any adult though, let alone one Shouto\u2019s dragging down alongside him. He knows Aizawa won't continue speaking until Shouto meets his eyes though, so he looks up with a sigh, guilt gnawing at him when he sees how tired his teacher looks. \u201cThere\u2019s more we can do. If worst comes to worst and nobody wants to take our case, then I still won\u2019t let him take you. I'll find a way for you to stay here.\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t think Aizawa will have much choice in the matter when it comes down to it. They both know that Endeavor\u2019s next step will more than likely be to pull Shouto from the hero course, from Yuuei. They\u2019re all stuck in one big waiting game and Shouto isn\u2019t too sure what his old man is waiting for.\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on this.\u201d Aizawa stresses as if he can see the doubt in Shouto's mind. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up on you.\u201d\nHe can feel something clog up inside him at those words, something deep and painful. He isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a good feeling or not, isn\u2019t sure if the words he\u2019s being told are good or not.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto absently wonders what Aizawa\u2019s breaking point will be with him.\n(He knows that his mother loved him once, long ago, but Shouto also learnt that love is never unconditional.)\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Aizawa tsks. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t know what to say to that so he chooses to keep quiet.\nOver the past month Aizawa has become someone who Shouto finds himself oddly drawn to, oddly calm around. The other man has a soothing atmosphere about him which at first seemed weird, but now seems more like a blessing then anything else. Shouto isn\u2019t sure how the other man did it, but he\u2019s somehow taught Shouto to put his trust in him, to depend on him, and it\u2019s nice to have somebody in his corner for once.\nIt\u2019s nice to know that Aizawa looked at him and saw him for what he was, saw Shouto as the failed product he is, and still decided to choose him regardless.\n\u201cStop putting yourself down.\u201d Aizawa tuts. He's looking at Shouto knowingly, reading his closed off expression and being able to tell what's lying underneath. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, but I promise you things will get better.\u201d\nThat\u2019s another thing Aizawa keeps doing. The promises\nShouto doesn\u2019t like putting that much faith and confidence in someone and yet something about Aizawa allows him to bridge the gaps in his distrust, in his doubt. Aizawa is committed to his job, to his students, and maybe that\u2019s why Shouto finds himself believing the other man more often than not. He\u2019s seen Aizawa try so hard with other people in his class, with Yaoyorozu and her confidence, Midoriya and his untrained Quirk, Bakugou and his anger, Ashido and her studies \u2013\nAizawa tries so hard for all of them. He trusts all of them and has gained their trust in return.\nIt\u2019s a mutual respect that Shouto has come to accept, come to use.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouto won\u2019t stop putting himself down, isn\u2019t sure if he knows how to stop, but he will try. For Aizawa, in a show of his thanks, he will try.\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d It makes Shouto feel warm knowing he\u2019s pleased the other man he\u2019s come to admire.\nFor the limited time he had it, Aizawa had taken full advantage of his role as Shouto's temporary guardian and had used it to help Shouto as much as he could. For example, his father is no longer his emergency contact and he\u2019s been granted special permission to stay at the 1-A dorms over all holidays. And then, when their case fell through on the police end, he\u2019d still chosen to keep Shouto under his wing, even when his guardian title had been stripped.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto says again, mind feeling fuzzy. He isn't too sure what exactly he's thanking Aizawa for, but he wants the elder to know that he's grateful, that he appreciates everything even if he can't put it into words.\n\u201cDon't thank me yet.\u201d Aizawa repeats, soft and firm. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever need to thank me for doing you right, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cCome on Halfie,\u201d Bakugou groans. \u201cSome of us want to go home already.\u201d\nBakugou and Shouto have started their remedial courses\u00a0to get their provisional hero licences and the training is both gruelling and harsh. It leaves them both tired, drained, and irritable.\nIt's a familiar feeling, one that makes Shouto tremble.\n\u201cFuck face,\u201d Bakugou kicks a stone at his shoe. \u201cLet's fucking get going.\u201d\nThe feeling of bruises forming on his body and aching muscles makes his mind falter and slip, makes everything around him blur into somewhere else, and he has to forcibly remind himself that Bakugou and Present Mic are waiting for him. He has to force himself to remember that he's not in his house with Endeavor watching him from the shadows. .\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Present Mic says, voice different to how it usually sounds, soft and lacking its usual brashness. There's a hand hovering above his shoulder and it guides him towards the car, his feet tripping over themselves on the way. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nShouto still isn\u2019t allowed to attend practical lessons after what happened but the school and his therapist have agreed that he could attend the remedial courses on the condition that one of his teachers is present at all times.\nHe'd scoffed internally at the time, feeling stupid and hurt that he couldn't be trusted by himself, but standing here now he sees why Aizawa pressed for him to have somebody who was aware of his situation present.\nHis head is floaty and blurred and it makes him feel sick, makes his stomach roll and his fingers twitch. He figures he probably pushed himself too hard today.\n\u201cIt's fucking creepy when you do that.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice jars him out of his head and he blinks to see that they're in Present Mic\u2019s car, scenery flashing by the window.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Shouto blinks again, twisting his head sluggishly to stare at the other boy.\nBakugou glares at him, a mottled bruise forming high on his cheekbone, but there's something disturbingly thoughtful in the anger his eyes hold. \u201cThe whole sleeping with your eyes open thing.\u201d\n\u201cI don't sleep with my eyes open.\u201d Shouto says before he can think better about it, regretting the words as soon as they leave his mouth. Having Bakugou think he\u2019s weird is much better than the truth.\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you do then?\u201d Bakugou scrunches up his face in disbelief. \u201cHave you just been mentally checking out on me for the past fucking ten minutes?\u201d\nYes, Shouto is tempted to say. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou're a fucking weirdo.\u201d Bakugou points out. There's no real heat behind his words though, both of them tired and aching and stuck in the same boat when it comes to the courses they\u2019re taking. They both have to work on\u00a0teamwork\u00a0during their lessons and it's forced Shouto to try and understand Bakugou more, to observe him more closely and learn how to work with the other boys Quirk. It's also forced Bakugou to watch Shouto in turn, which is odd. Uncomfortable.\n(His siblings are gone. His mother is gone.\nThere is nobody left in life but his father, but Endeavor.\nHe hasn't seen anyone outside of his old man for so long that Shouto wonders whether or not there could ever be a life for him bar this, bar Endeavor and being his son.\nEven Fuyumi\u2019s limited access has been revoked, Shouto's latest act of rebellion having harsh consequences.\nHe won't give in, though. He won't use his fire.\nIn the silence of his room Shouto let's frost creep across the floor, covering the wood in icy tendrils, and wonders if anybody else in the world has noticed his disappearance.\nHe wonders what it would be like to disappear completely, indefinitely.)\nShouto has spent so long not being seen that having all this attention suddenly thrown onto him feels oppressive. It\u2019s daunting and terrifying because Shouto isn't sure what they'll see in the end if they keep looking. He isn't sure if the monster lurking underneath his skin is the same colour as his father's, red and black and angry, or whether his ice has turned it into something even more unimaginable.\nA knee presses against his cautiously, curiously, and it makes him blink, fog receding because of the pressure. He looks down to see Bakugou\u2019s knee pressed up against his own and when he turns to face Bakugou the older boy is watching him with a frown, eyes observing Shouto with interest.\nWhat are you doing\u00a0Shouto thinks.\u00a0Why are you doing that.\nBakugou looks like he's figured something out, looks like he's confirmed his own theory, and Shouto can't follow the other boys line of thought. He doesn\u2019t know if he wants to understand it.\nBakugou\u2019s knee is warm and firm against his own and it\u2019s oddly grounding, oddly \u2013\n\u201cIf you're gonna sleep at least close your fucking eyes, Half and Half.\u201d Bakugou turns to stare out the window, dismissing Shouto as quickly as he took interest in him.\nHe doesn't move his leg though, and Shouto doesn't either. He takes the other boys advice and leans his head against the window, letting his eyes flutter shut.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere is an expanse of space in his mind.\nThe space isn\u2019t real, his therapist reminds him.\u00a0The brain can\u2019t be divided into here and there, can\u2019t be split into again and before, because it\u2019s all the same.\nHe knows that the space isn\u2019t real but--\nBut.\nThere is an expanse of space in his mind that stretches and tugs, that pushes and pulls. It\u2019s a tide of absence, always lurching and drawing him in when it\u2019s high tide and leaving him more settled and aware when it\u2019s not broaching his consciousness.\nThere is a space where clouds roll and waves crash and Shouto gets lost in it. The space reacts to him sometimes, fuelled and powered by his emotions, but every so often he can\u2019t help what lurks there. Sometimes the waves crash against his mind and the clouds break through, entrancing and demanding in all they offer. Sometimes Shouto will seek them out, will let himself get lost in them on purpose.\n(\u201cMy baby,\u201d his mother's voice is thin and watery and there are bruises on her arms, bruises that were meant for him. \u201cMy beautiful boy.\u201d\nShe brushes a hand over the right side of his face, cold fingers on his cold cheek, on his temple, in his hair. She doesn\u2019t touch the left side of him anymore and he doesn\u2019t think much of it.\nShe doesn\u2019t like him using his fire anymore and he doesn\u2019t think much of it.\nShe looks at him like he\u2019s somebody else, doing double-takes when Endeavor puts him through physical training, and he doesn\u2019t think much of it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d She tells him, wiping the tears off of his right cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so good, my Shouto.\u201d\nSometimes Shouto doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s good.\nHe feels weak and useless when standing in the shadow of his father. He feels alone and worthless, feels like his Quirk was a curse instead of a gift.\nSometimes his mother makes him feel like it\u2019s okay, like he\u2019s loved and like things will be okay, but when he opens his eyes to see purple blooming on her pale, pale skin he feels an overwhelming doubt.\nYesterday his father pushed him too hard, pushed him too far, and the thing is that Shouto\u2019s Quirk is still so new, still so untrained in comparison to Endeavor\u2019s. It\u2019s uncontrollable and it hurts and yesterday his training had done more damage than good.\nToday Shouto was tired and hesitant and he knows he was to blame, knows that it was his fault, but his mother had stepped up in his place, defiant and proud.\n\u201cI-I can handle it.\u201d He wants to handle it, wants to stop his mother from hurting. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to protect me.\u201d\n\u201cMy Shouto.\u201d His mother sighs. \u201cI can handle it too. This,\u201d she trails her fingers down to where a fingerprint shaped bruises sit on his arm. \u201cIs not your legacy. You can be so much more.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s all the same.\u00a0His therapist tells him.\u00a0It\u2019s all you, Shouto.\nThere is a space in his mind, void and alive, and it calls to him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto doesn't hear from his father like he expects.\nIt's odd and the longer things continue as usual the more anxious he becomes.\nHis therapist notes it in their next session, records his twitching fingers and longer pauses, and it makes him feel out of control. He used to be better at pretending, at hiding himself behind a blank face and the clouds, but something in him has been torn open.\nThe flame of hope that wanted the help, that wanted him to be better, has ignited and it\u2019s burning away at him, flames thick and angry. He'd wanted this, had thought he'd wanted this, but the air around him feels heavy and Shouto can't handle it. All the worry, the concern, it's\u00a0too much.\nIt's too much.\n(Fuyumi wraps his bloody hands with a tight expression as Touya lets out a string of curses from the bathroom doorway.\n\u201cHow long are we fucking going to let this happen for?\u201d his brother demands. Shouto feels like he's watching the conversation from above his body, feels like it hurts less this way. \u201cHow long are we going to play pretend?\u201d\n\u201cThere's nothing we can do.\u201d Fuyumi says flatly.\n\u201cThe police. Child services.\u201d Touya lists them off on his fingers. \u201cRunning away-\u201d\n\u201cYou know we can't do any of that.\u201d Fuyumi sighs, fingers tying the end of the bandage together.\n\u201cLike fuck we can't-\u201d\n\u201cFor Shouto,\u201d His sister holds his eyes, her own grey and light just like their mom's, like one of Shouto\u2019s own, and gently let's go of his hands. \u201cWe have to stay.\u201d)\nThere is a fine line between fraying and unravelling. Shouto likes to think he can walk the balance, can keep himself from falling apart at the seams whilst letting some of his edges lose.\nHe thinks of the darkness his mind can offer him, more real and understanding than anything around him, and thinks that maybe this time he can control it better.\nIn the darkness of his room Shouto squeezes his hands into fists, lets heat and frost bite at his palms, and thinks about control, about how much it hurts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do you feel about watching a man cut off his own foot?\u201d Kirishima asks him when he steps into the common area.\n\u201cA man,\u201d Shouto says blankly, noting that nobody else seems alarmed by this question. \u201cCutting off his own foot.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kaminari nods enthusiastically which is - disturbing. \u201cWith a saw.\u201d\nShouto blinks once, twice, but nothing changes, everything solid and stable around them.\n\u201cIt's either a man cutting off his own foot or a bunch of boys swimming.\u201d Kaminari and Kirishima crowd in close, both of the boys staring at Shouto as if he's the answer to all their problems. \u201cI need your vote on the man and the saw, Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Shouto feels like he's missing something. Either that or he needs to find Aizawa and inform the man that the entire class have lost their minds.\n\u201cChoose the swimming boys.\u201d Kirishima begs. \u201cI'll be sick if I watch a man saw his own foot off.\u201d\n\u201cStop wording it so weirdly.\u201d Tokoyami snaps. \u201cYou're purposely trying to make him pick the swimming option.\u201d\n\u201cI think both options are rubbish.\u201d Sero points out from where he's sprawled over a sofa. \u201cWhy can't we just watch-\u201d\n\u201cDon't.\u201d Jirou warns. \u201cIt took us long enough to narrow it down to just these two. We don't need more suggestions thrown about.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what is it, Todoroki?\u201d Kirishima presses. \u201cThe man chopping off his own foot or a bunch of boys hanging out in a pool?\u201d\nShouto blinks uncertainty but settles on \u201cthe swimming option.\u201d when it becomes apparent that everybody expects an answer from him. His choice elects a cheer from most of the girls in the room and a groan from Kaminari who clutches at his heart with a pained expression.\n\u201cThis is a fixed vote.\u201d the other boy complains, throwing himself down across Sero\u2019s legs dramatically. \u201cOur government is corrupted.\u201d\n\u201cIgnore him.\u201d Kirishima throws an arm around Shouto's shoulders and tugs him towards where Ashido is sitting. \u201cYou made the right choice, bro.\u201d\n\u201cYeah you did.\u201d Ashido pulls him down next to her, Kirishima settling in closely on his other side. \u201cI knew you wouldn't let us down.\u201d\n\u201cOur hero.\u201d Asui agrees.\n\u201cI'm not too sure what's happening.\u201d Shouto admits aloud. He catches Midoriya\u2019s eyes, the smaller boy sitting on the floor with Uraraka, and throws him a desperate look.\n\u201cMovie night.\u201d The green eyed boy explains with a grin. \u201cIt was between a horror movie -\u00a0Saw, I think? - and an anime called\u00a0Free!\u201d\n\u201cSaw was the better option.\u201d Kaminari scoffs. \u201cNow I'm gonna be stuck staring at anime abs all night.\u201d\n\u201cYou're just jealous.\u201d Yaoyorozu teases.\n\u201cI still think we should be watching something more educational.\u201d Iida points out, causing a series of groans from the people around them.\n\u201cDon't start this again.\u201d Hagakure huffs. \u201cLet's just watch what we've agreed to watch.\u201d\nSo this is how Shouto finds himself spending his evening: watching an anime squished between what seems to be the two biggest\u00a0Free!\u00a0fans in the room.\nIt's part of the continued series of events that leave him confused and oddly pleased, oddly warm.\nHis classmates - his\u00a0friends\u00a0- keep him close, keep him distracted, and it's nice, it\u2019s soothing, and it makes something in him soften. It makes his mind quieten and the internal struggle of not knowing what to do, of not knowing who to be, slow down to a halt.\n(\u201cTo become the number one hero requires you to actually pay attention to me.\u201d His father's face is close to Shouto's, eyes narrowed dangerously and flames casting his face in threatening shadows. \u201cIf you don't pay attention, boy, you're only going to embarrass us both.\u201d\nGood\u00a0Shouto thinks. The skin around his left eye itches and throbs and Shouto thinks\u00a0let us be embarrassed. Let the world know what you've done.\u00a0\nIf he were braver he'd say it. If he were stronger he'd do something about it, but Shouto isn't sure he'll ever get there.\nHe doesn't want to be a hero, doesn't want to turn into his father, and if keeping quiet is the only way he can prove that, then it's what Shouto will do.\n\u201cStop being so weak.\u201d His father's eyes are blue and Shouto hates them. He hates all of him. He hates himself. \u201cStop letting your emotions control you. We've spoken about this.\u201d\nShouto shuts his eyes, knowing what's coming next. \u201cYour stupid mother,\u201d He pictures his mother hugging him, proud and apologetic, brave and yet so lost, and her gentle way of convincing him that the word hero wasn't synonymous with Endeavor. \u201cShe's coddled you too much. Look at yourself, Shouto. Look at how pathetic you're being. She might have ruined your face but don't let her ruin who you are as well.\u201d)\nWhen the people from his class keep trying with him it reminds Shouto that maybe it's okay to be himself, that maybe it's okay to be confused and awkward, to not know what he's doing, because they don't care. Because they like him regardless of his flaws.\n\u201cDo you know any card games?\u201d Iida asks him the following Thursday. \u201cAny other game besides\u00a0Snap?\u201d\n\u201cSnap is a good game.\u201d Midoriya pouts, fingers fiddling with the edge of a card. \u201cSnap is the best game.\u201d\n\u201cIt was fine for the first few rounds.\u201d Iida sounds pained. \u201cBut we\u2019ve played almost ten games now and I\u2019m finding it hard to believe that nobody else in this room knows any other game besides\u00a0Snap.\u201d\n\u201cCards are old fashioned.\u201d Kaminari points out. \u201cWhy would you use them?\u201d\n\u201cOld fashioned?\u201d Yaoyorozu sounds bewildered. \u201cHow are they old fashioned?\u201d\n\u201cThey just are.\u201d Kaminari picks up a bunch of cards and flaps them around as if they\u2019re not all talking about the same thing. \u201cLook at them \u2013 old and useless.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll break them.\u201d Uraraka snaps, snatching the cards from his hand. \u201cThey\u2019re delicate, you idiot.\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Kaminari nods. \u201cThey\u2019re old, useless,\u00a0and\u00a0breakable.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Shouto decides at this point, not wanting to deal with games and loudness and unnecessary stress. \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\u201cBed?\u201d Kirishima whispers behind his back. Shouto ignores him, keeping his feet steady as he heads towards the lifts, temples pulsing from\u00a0the headache that\u2019s been building all afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not even six.\u201d\nHe can feel them watching him as he presses the button, gazes heavy on his back, and he wishes not for the first time that he could go unnoticed. He wishes that he could hide behind aloofness, behind a cold exterior, and go back to the start where people were only mildly curious about him and not so overwhelmingly invested.\nMidoriya slips into the lift before the doors can close behind him. Shouto raises an eyebrow at the smaller boy and Midoriya smiles innocently in return, cheeks slightly flushed, and posture determined.\n\u201cNot playing snap?\u201d He asks when it\u2019s clear Midoriya\u2019s not going to offer an explanation without Shouto starting the conversation first.\n\u201cSnap got boring.\u201d Midoriya shrugs.\n\u201cI thought it was the best?\u201d\n\u201cThis is better.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shouto tilts his head. \u201cStanding in the elevator with me?\u201d\nThe tips of Midoriya\u2019s ears turn red but the older boy doesn\u2019t back down, giving a quick stubborn nod of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re good company.\u201d and then, before Shouto can scoff, \u201cI'd rather spend time with you over them anyway.\u201d\nThe doors ding open but Shouto\u2019s too busy staring blankly at Midoriya to realise. The other boy is so open with his affection, with his honesty, that Shouto is never quite sure what to do with it. He\u2019s not quite sure what he\u2019s done to deserve it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d Shouto mutters belatedly but Midoriya isn\u2019t next to him anymore, is now standing outside the lift and holding the door open for Shouto.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d Midoriya asks, looking warm and soft in the light of the hallway.\n\u201cAm I coming to my own room?\u201d Shouto questions blankly. The doors of the lift bump into Midoriya\u2019s hand before opening back up.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Midoriya says patiently. \u201cAre you coming to your room?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u00a0not\u00a0going to go to my room.\u201d Shouto takes a step out of the lift and frowns down at the older boy. \u201cAre you going to my room?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not not not going to go to your room.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you not not -\u201d\n\u201cShouto-kun.\u201d Midoriya interrupts, eyes soft and kind and amused, all of the things Shouto doesn\u2019t deserve directed at him, all the kindness that will only ruin them both in the end. \u201cI want to spend time with you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a weird thought, someone\u00a0wanting\u00a0to spend time with him. Even though it\u2019s becoming a more common occurrence it\u2019s still so perplexing, so odd, especially when it comes from people like Midoriya.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouto says, not really understanding at all but not wanting to send Midoriya away. A part of him wants to be alone, wants to be left by himself so he can get lost in his own head, but a bigger part of him wants Midoriya there.\nHe wants to be distracted, wants to let Midoriya make him feel like he\u2019s more than withered petals left to dissolve on the cold floor. He wants to let himself have this because he doesn\u2019t have anything else.\nHis family is nothing but planets out of trajectory, nothing but floating moons and burnt out stars.\nShouto, as he is now, is nothing but a husk of a person with rotting insides.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you of course.\u201d Midoriya smiles like Shouto\u2019s worthy of it, pink lips curling and freckles scrunching by his eyes. He waits for Shouto to nod before heading towards his room, letting Shouto trail behind him as he starts to talk about what Shouto missed during their sparring lesson that afternoon.\nHe doesn\u2019t mind that Shouto stays quiet, happy to let him listen, no words needing to be passed between them to explain that this is what he needs. They sit in his room, shoulder to shoulder, the decor replicating his house at home, and Midoriya speaks for the both of them. He fills the oppressive white noise that rings in Shouto\u2019s ears with his own gentle voice.\nThe moon shines through a gap in Shouto\u2019s curtains and makes Midoriya\u2019s dark hair glow, skin painted pale and ethereal. The buzzing under Shouto\u2019s skin dilutes and settles, his muscles growing lax and his heart beat softening, breaths falling into the same rhythm as Midoriya\u2019s.\nIt\u2019s in moments like this, quiet and alone with the older boy all to himself, that Shouto likes to compare Midoriya to something akin to fresh fruit: ripe and sweet, bright and flourishing, and undeniably good for him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYour sister still lives at home, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Aizawa asks him, voice tenser than usual.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto feels his fingers twitch at the reminder. \u201cShe does.\u201d\nAizawa curses under his breath, hands curling where they lay on the desk. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise.\u201d He looks pained, looks guilty. \u201cIs she safe?\u201d\n(\u201cYou\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d Shouto whispers. His sister rolls her eyes, face narrower than Shouto remembers it being, hair shorter.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do to me?\u201d Fuyumi scoffs. \u201cHe acts like I don\u2019t exist, Shouto. It\u2019s you that\u2019ll get in trouble if we\u2019re caught -\u00a0but\u00a0we won\u2019t be. He\u2019s out, we have time.\u201d\n\u201cYou could still get in trouble.\u201d Shouto presses, eyes darting about nervously. Their father is miles away on a business trip and Fuyumi has snuck in to see him, to keep him company, but Shouto wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Endeavor could step from the shadows, a monster lurking in the darkness, always ready to consume them. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d his sisters eyes become softer, grow sad and pained, and for a second, he can almost convince himself that he\u2019s looking at his mother. \u201cShouto,\u201d she says, his name delicate and gentle, \u201che won\u2019t hurt me. He...\u201d she hesitates and the distance between them grows, an ocean of differences separating their similarities, depths of water washing and distorting what\u2019s\u00a0the same. To be so alike and yet so so different. To live in fear of the same man with such different things scaring them is hard.\n\u201cI\u2019m different.\u201d Fuyumi settles on.\u00a0You\u2019re different,\u00a0she doesn\u2019t say.\nHe wishes there was a wall between them so that he didn\u2019t have to see her face, to see her strength, to see how weak they both are when it comes to their hero of a father.)\nHis teacher is asking\u00a0does he treat her like he treats you.\nIn the sense Aizawa asking, Fuyumi is safe. He\u2019s not asking\u00a0does he hurt her differently, so Shouto says, \u201cshe\u2019s safe.\u201d and Aizawa sags slightly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just you that he...\u201d Aizawa pauses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d Shouto confirms. He is the only one Endeavor is focused on, the only one out of his siblings that holds his attention. \u201cShe\u2019s always been able to look after herself.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve looked after yourself pretty well.\u201d Aizawa does this thing, he\u2019s noticed, where he will always try and paint Shouto in a positive light. \u201cAll things considered, Shouto, you\u2019ve done really well for yourself.\u201d\nHe thinks of his mother, of his scarred face, of his ignored siblings and thinks\u00a0is this well?\nThere is poison in his veins, thick and ugly, and he often wonders how far his mother would\u2019ve had to burn him to unveil the monster that lurks underneath his skin. He thinks this and feels clouds build, feels his skin crawl, and wants to ask is\u00a0this doing well?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFuyumi turns up at the school, all pale hair and sharp edges, eyes familiar and guarded and her lips pressed into a thin smile. She looks calm and collected from the outside, but for her to be\u00a0here\u00a0\u2013 for her to be here after Shouto had\u00a0told\u00a0on his father\u00a0\u2013\u00a0must means there\u2019s more to it.\nShe\u2019s walking with Aizawa, the both of them heading towards the dorms, when their eyes meet across the courtyard.\nKirishima and Midoryia\u2019s voices are starting to ring in his ears, Bakugou\u2019s shout sounding strangely muffled, and Shouto has the sudden urge to turn around and run the other way. He doesn't want to deal with this, whatever\u00a0this\u00a0is. He just wants to escape to his dorm room, to the back of his mind maybe, and stay there, but the thing is \u2013\nFuyumi is familiar and she\u2019s safe. She\u2019s his family. She\u2019s the oldest out of them all and is the only constant he\u2019s ever known. A part of him is so desperately relieved to see her here, to see her after everything he\u2019s been struggling to deal with (attacking All Might, Aizawa offering to help, the word\u00a0dissociation), that he finds himself rooted to the spot, tendrils digging into the ground and securing him in place, both physically and mentally.\nBy the time he shakes off his dizziness, his sister is already making her way over to him and he notices that there\u2019s something more desperate about her too, something understanding and\u00a0raw hanging over her.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d she breathes as she reaches him, eyes raking over him for any signs of injury. The routine of her patching him up in the aftermath of their father is automatic, is ingrained into them both like a twisted routine, and he finds the action oddly comforting.\nHer hands hover over him like she wants to hug, like she wants to pull him in, but she knows that Shouto has always been funny about\u00a0touch\u00a0and\u00a0affection.\nShouto isn\u2019t who he was back then though, isn\u2019t as colourless and blank as before. He\u2019s adapted to people now, to noise and living somewhere that doesn\u2019t consist of ghosts haunting every corner. It\u2019s not until he sees Fuyumi hesitate to touch him that he understands what Aizawa meant when he said that Shouto had grown.\nThere was once a time where he would\u2019ve flinched away from any touch, where he would have avoided even the gentle ones because, coming from his siblings especially, he could only picture the betrayal of his mother.\n(His mother\u2019s eyes had been big and terrified, and she\u2019d stared at Shouto as if he were monstrous. She started at him as if he was more than just skinny arms and sunken eyes, as if there wasn\u2019t still puppy fat clinging to his cheeks and as if he didn\u2019t have a lisp from one of his teeth falling out.\nWhatever she saw when she looked his way couldn\u2019t have been him. He refuses to believe that she would do that to him, refuses to believe that Shouto alone was enough to make her \u2013\nHe often wonders what she saw that day.\nHer hands had clutched the kettle, steam whistling from the top, and he so desperately wants to know what she saw when she looked his way. He wants to know what made her take a step closer, what made her lift it up and-)\nHis hands squeeze hers, unnaturally cold on his left side but familiarly chilled on his right, and she looks so pleased that he wishes he could\u2019ve broken himself out of the bonds his father forced him into years ago.\n\u201cFuyumi.\u201d He says in return, feeling oddly shy. There are things floating between them, secrets lurking in their shadows and simmering where they\u2019re bathed in the afternoon light, but the thing with Fuyumi, the thing with all his siblings, is the accepted understanding when it comes to who they are.\nShe pulls him in for a quick hug, arms squeezing tight around his shoulders, before she pulls back and holds him at arm's length, eyes still absently scanning him as if Shouto\u2019s eight years old and pretending that there isn\u2019t charred skin under his sleeves.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He asks her and then, belatedly remembering the manners Midoriya has been trying to teach him, \u201chow are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Fuyumi smooths the wrinkles out of his shirt sleeves absently, wind tugging at the strands of her hair. \u201cDo I need a reason to see you now?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto frowns. \u201cThere\u2019s always a reason.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d Fuyumi says firmly, but Shouto sees her barely their hesitation.\n\u201cYou needed to see me.\u201d He guesses. Fuyumi\u2019s right eye twitches as she smiles which means\u00a0yes.\u00a0Which means\u00a0please don\u2019t make me say it.\u00a0\u201cHe\u00a0needed you to see me.\u201d Shouto realises, feeling something unpleasant curl in his stomach when his sister grimaces.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Uraraka\u2019s voice bursts them both out of the bubble they\u2019d put themselves in, her airy voice curious and her brown eyes wide and intrigued as they flick between him and Fuyumi.\nShouto remembers abruptly that they\u2019re at Yuuei, that his friends are off to one side and Aizawa is now on the other, and that their family home is miles away.\n\u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d Shouto watches the way Kirishima\u2019s eyes widen and Bakugou\u2019s eyebrows raise as they both stare at Fuyumi with new interest.\n\u201cYour\u00a0what?\u201d Kirishima cries. \u201cDude, you never said you had a sister.\u201d\n\u201cYou never\u00a0asked\u00a0if I had a sister.\u201d Shouto points out.\n\u201cYou mean to say you don\u2019t talk about me constantly?\u201d Fuyumi teases, effortlessly falling into the social familiarities Shouto has never understood. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible little brother, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would I say about you?\u201d Shouto frowns.\n\u201cYou could start with saying she existed.\u201d Kirishima points out, bowing belatedly at Fuyumi. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Todoroki-san.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, uh.\u201d Fuyumi glances at Shouto for help and he\u2019s tempted to let her suffer, to let her deal with this on her own, but he\u2019d never hear the end of it if he did.\n\u201cKirishima.\u201d Shouto clarifies, and then, glancing at the rest, \u201cBakugou, Uraraka, and Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course. Hello.\u201d She nods politely, turning to look back at Shouto. \u201cI'm not interrupting anything, right Shouto?\u201d\n\nHe needed you to see me.\n\n(\u201cYou are my son, Shouto.\u201d His father tuts, looming over where Shouto\u2019s sprawled on the floor. \u201cBut you\u2019re acting like a Quirkless\u00a0bastard\u00a0and I\u2019m sick and tired of- \u201c)\nShouto\u2019s tempted to say\u00a0yes, he is busy, actually, but-\n\u201cHe\u2019s free.\u201d Midoriya chirps, eyes bright and hair messy. \u201cWe just finished at the gym.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Aizawa steps closer, tilting his head towards where the main campus building is. \u201cYou can use my classroom to talk, if you need.\u201d\n\u201cSee you later, Shouto-kun.\u201d Midoriya waves, tugging on Uraraka\u2019s sleeve to get the rest of them to follow him. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Todoroki-san.\u201d\nAnd then they\u2019re gone, leaving Shouto standing next to his sister as Aizawa watches him expectantly, something thick and significant hanging over them all like smoke.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you to my class, then.\u201d Aizawa says when it becomes apparent Shouto isn\u2019t going to lead the way. His teacher twists on his heal and starts to head towards the building, Fuyumi raising her eyebrows at him when he hesitates to follow.\nHe\u2019s scared, is the stupid thing. He\u2019s been playing the waiting game with his father for so long, long days and longer nights leaving him twitching with nerves, that Shouto almost forgot that his father could use his siblings as other players.\nHe needed you to see me\u00a0means that\u00a0this,\u00a0whatever this is, is what they\u2019ve been waiting for. His sister turning up at Yuuei is the move they\u2019ve been waiting on, is his father making the next step by- Well. Who knows what he\u2019s doing or why he\u2019s using Fuyumi to do it.\nWho even\u00a0wants\u00a0to know, really, because it can\u2019t\u00a0be anything good. Whatever was to come next could never be anything good.\nThe walk to Aizawa\u2019s classroom seems both too long and too short and by the time it\u2019s just Fuyumi and him sitting in his empty home room he feels more than sick.\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d He asks when the door clicks shut behind Aizawa\u2019s retreating form, eyes watching his sister closely for any signs that she\u2019s lying. \u201cWhat does\u00a0he\u00a0want?\u201d\n\u201cShouto.\u201d His sister hesitates again, fingers twisting a lock of pale hair around her fingers. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He dismisses, nerves coiling in his stomach, anxiety gnawing at his ribs, clouds circling in his mind.\n\u201cYou seem fine.\u201d She agrees which Shouto thinks is a lie. How Shouto could be fine after his father? How any of them could be fine\u00a0is ridiculous. \u201cBetter than the last time I saw you.\u201d His sister continues.\n\u201cBetter.\u201d He agrees. He debates for a moment before deciding to confess to her, \u201cI see a therapist now.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Fuyumi seems surprised at first and then pleased, just like when Shouto reached out for her back outside. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Shou. That\u2019s really good.\u201d\n(\u201cI got in.\u201d Shouto tells his sister. \u201cTo Yuuei.\u201d\n\u201cOh Shouto,\u201d Fuyumi breathes, eyes wide and happy. \u201cThat\u2019s such good news.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on the hero course.\u201d Shouto says flatly, his insides a fighting mix of\u00a0relieved\u00a0and\u00a0terrified.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d Fuyumi repeats firmly. \u201cYou can be anything you want to be, Shouto.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t mention their father, don\u2019t mention that this is what he wants for Shouto. The silence stretches and Shouto feels his eyes burn, feels his fingers twitch, and suddenly admits in a shaky voice, \u201cI want mom.\u201d\nHe wants to know if she would be proud of him, wants to know if she\u2019d forgive him. He wants to know if she would look at him and see Endeavor, if she would see fire and scars and think,\u00a0is this what you\u2019ve chosen to become?\nHe hasn\u2019t used his fire for years, doesn\u2019t dare, doesn\u2019t even dream of it anymore, but sometimes when he looks in the mirror he sees a stifled monster trying it\u2019s best to escape.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Fuyumi offers. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much, Shou, but know that I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019ll always be proud, whatever you choose to do.\u201d)\n\u201cDo you know what I did?\u201d He asks her tiredly.\n\u201cDo I know that you told someone?\u201d His sister phrases it as a question but they both know it\u2019s not. He shifts and she sighs, face pale in the light of the classroom. \u201cYeah.\u201d She says quietly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He asks again, waves rolling in and surroundings starting to crack as things turn hazy.\nFuyumi crosses her legs neatly, face conflicted before it softens, a small choked noise escaping from her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Shouto.\u201d\nHer words are unexpected and he isn\u2019t sure what to do with them. They are familiar in a way, reminiscent of what she\u2019s said to him before, and yet so different because this time Shouto believes her. This time he feels like he\u2019s done something worthy of her pride.\n\u201cWhat has he been like?\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to know, not really, but Fuyumi is still stuck there and he\u2019s been worried about her.\n(His mother's face when she walks into the room to see the ice is one of delight and joy, lips stretched into a proud grin, but the second she registers the smoke hanging in the air it slowly fades.\nFuyumi and Natsu are still next to him, still protecting him as his father strides over and his mother grows tense in the doorway.)\n(His mother, bruised and tired, says, \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d as the front door opens. Shouto moves further behind her legs, wishing she could hide him, wishing he could hide them both.)\n\u201cHe was angry at first.\u201d Fuyumi taps her fingers on her leg, eyes lost in thought. \u201cHe was so angry, was going to take you out of school and- well, who knows what he would\u2019ve done. Kept you at home, maybe. Moved you away. But then he must have realised that taking you away from Yuuei when there are rumours circling about his parenting? When people are watching him as the new number one? It would be bad for his reputation. It could ruin it.\u201d She laughs then, flat and humourless, blue painted nails drumming agitatedly on her leg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been about him.\u201d Shouto confirms, lips twitching and his own fingers curling inwards.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Fuyumi agrees after a beat. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about what he wants and what he thinks and what he\u00a0does \u2013\u201d she pauses, takes a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about you, Shouto. Even when it was, it wasn\u2019t, not really.\u201d\n(\u201cYou were created to defeat All Might. You need to stop focusing on other people and start focusing on yourself.\u201d Endeavor says it simply, states it as a fact.\nHis mother is gone and she\u2019s not coming back to him. Nobody is coming to save him from his father.)\n\u201cHe was angry, especially when you got a new lawyer, but then he realised that it\u2019d get him nowhere if he fought fire with fire. He realised that it\u2019d prove nothing but the truth, so he just stopped. It\u2019s easier for all of us if you\u2019re called a liar in the long run, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a liar.\u201d He snaps, hurt and relieved and so, so disbelieving. \u201cI\u2019m not lying about him-\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d His sister says patiently, softly. \u201cShouto I know better than anyone that you\u2019re not lying. I wanted people to know too, once. I\u2019ve\u00a0wanted\u00a0people to see him for who he\u00a0was\u00a0but,\u201d she hesitates. \u201cHe\u2019s our father, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto feels something in him shrivel up, feels something claw at his lungs. \u201cHe\u2019s not. That\u2019s not what a dad\u00a0does, Fuyumi.\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2019s gone.\u201d She says simply. Her voice blurs when she says her next words, the deeper baritone of Endeavor creeping in. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, Shouto, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever really going to get her back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Shouto whispers. This isn\u2019t about their mother, isn\u2019t about Fuyumi or him, not really, because it\u2019s always been about-\n\u201cEndeavor,\u201d Fuyumi sounds like she\u2019s trying to convince herself as much as him. \u201cIs not who he was. He said he wants to try and be better, Shouto. He said that he wants us to be proud of him and I\u2014 We. All I\u2019ve ever wanted is for us to be a family.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m family.\u201d Shouto argues. \u201cIs that not enough?\u201d\n\u201cIf I were to give up on him I\u2019d be no better than him, would I?\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re taking his\u00a0side?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not sides.\u201d His sisters voice cracks and she takes breath, fingers pushing her glasses up. \u201cThere should have never of been sides.\u201d She says in a calmer tone. \u201cWe\u2019re all Todoroki\u2019s, Shouto. I\u2019ll always stick by you and Natsu. I stuck by mom even though she,\u201d\u00a0snapped, cracked,\u00a0\u201cdid what she did. If he\u2019s willing to try and he\u2019s serious about it then I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t give him a chance.\u201d\nHe blinks at her, the nauseous feeling in his stomach growing more intense, but the torn pieces of this picture are slowly being put together. Tape and glue mesh the different parts together and he can see it for what it is, can see the strokes and the deliberate decisions of the brush and-\nShouto is scared of his father\u2019s violence, of his obsession, of becoming the same man his mother saw when she looked at them both, but Fuyumi-\nFuyumi fears being alone.\nShe was barely acknowledged by their old man and only ever saw the aftermath of what he was, of what he could do. She never saw Endeavor\u2019s skin split to reveal the flaming beast that haunts Shouto\u2019s dreams.\nFuyumi\u2019s always been kinder than him, always more understanding. She had chosen to be a teacher because she wants to teach, wants to spread knowledge, wants to influence people to be better.\nShe is a better person then Shouto will ever be because there is an ocean between them, deep and dangerous, murky and cold. Fuyumi had been purified by the waves, had been blessed with an understanding he\u2019ll never have, whereas Shouto got lost within the riptide and was washed up along bloodied shores. He\u2019s stuck on his own island, alone and lost with the tide still nipping at his heels, whilst Fuyumi tries to build bridges that will never reach him.\nThey are so alike and yet so different and it\u2019s so,\u00a0so\u00a0hard.\nHe is so tired and-\nHis father's next move is redemption. There isn't going to be any punishment, isn't going to end in bloodied faces and shaking muscles, because his father has won.\nShouto is broken and worthless, is discarded as the future number one because Endeavor has that title now, is working on earning that title.\nHe had pictured being taken from Yuuei. He had dreamt of court cases. The reality is somehow even worse.\nFuyumi wouldn\u2019t lie about his father, wouldn\u2019t make up that he\u2019s trying to change.\nShouto has been ripped apart until he\u2019s nothing and now, when he\u2019s finally seeking justice, when he\u2019s finally found someone to listen to him, when he finally has a chance to piece himself back together, his father wants to burn what\u2019s left of his ashes and extinguish him completely.\nHis father wants to start sticking the shattered pieces of their family back together and in the process, he has taken the only thing Shouto had left.\n\u201cShouto?\u201d Fuyumi\u2019s voice is muffled, is distant and scratchy. \u201cCome on - hey.\u201d Her hand touches his arm and he rips it away, rips himself away, feels his back hit the wall as he heaves.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He snarls, ice licking at his arm. His father\u2019s next move after all this time is\u00a0changing? After Shouto, after Touya, after his\u00a0mother\u00a0- he\u2019s going to change now? When it\u2019s already too late?\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2013 Just.\u201d He curls his hands in his hair, tugs on it, and tries to remember how to breathe.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying.\u201d His sister says, trying to calm him down but only making it worse. \u201cI promise, Shouto. He wants to see you, he wants to start over-\u201d\nWhen Shouto blinks his sister is in front of him, arm outstretched but not touching, eyes familiar and face a mix of her own and his mothers. He blinks again, and she is two steps away, five steps, eight.\n\u201cBreathe.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice tells him. \u201cShouto, you need to listen to me.\u201d\n(\u201cListen to what I\u2019m saying, Shouto.\u201d His father tells him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you, boy. You think you\u2019d be more grateful.\u201d\n\u201cEnji,\u201d his mother breathes from the doorway. \u201cLeave him be.\u201d\n\u201cStay out of this.\u201d Endeavor snarls. \u201cHe needs to stop being so weak, so pathetic-\u201d)\nThere is a space in the back of his mind and Shouto thought that he could control it, maybe. He thought that he could build and reconstruct it at his own will, but it\u2019s demanding and vicious and so alive when the rest of him isn\u2019t. When it claws its way to the front Shouto can\u2019t stop it, can\u2019t fight it, even if he wanted to, even if a part of him is saying\u00a0in for three, out for three.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Shouto comes back to himself he\u2019s sitting on the dorm sofas and All Might \u2013\u00a0Toshinori,\u00a0his brain reminds him \u2013 is next to him.\n\u201cSo, then I thought, why not just smash him into the ground? I was in Detroit at the time, so I shouted\u00a0Detroit-\u201d\n\u201cStop it.\u201d Aizawa has his head in his hands, black hair messy and stands standing on end. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t have time to listen to you name every state.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be\u00a0lucky\u00a0to hear me name every state.\u201d Toshinori scoffs. \u201cThere\u2019s an entire documentary series on this information and here I am, offering you quality content for\u00a0free-\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Aizawa groans. \u201cI told you to go home.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my colleague not my sensei, you can\u2019t\u00a0actually\u00a0tell me what to do.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Aizawa slumps down on the sofa, eyes tired and skin pale. \u201cStay! Talk about your stupid moves.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not stupid.\u201d Toshinori tuts. \u201cThey inspire hope.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll inspire hope in a minute.\u201d Aizawa mutters.\n\u201cIf you threaten me I\u2019ll-\u201d\n\u201cSensei.\u201d Shouto interrupts, mind feeling thick and tongue loose. Aizawa sits up straighter, suddenly alert and eyes observing Shouto \u2013 worriedly?\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Aizawa greets quietly. \u201cAlright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Shouto says, embarrassed and confused. \u201cSorry.\u201d he whispers, nervous to how long he\u2019s been floating.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Aizawa asks at the same time Toshinori says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologise for.\u201d\nShouto looks between them, head spinning. \u201cSorry.\u201d He repeats, trying to find the words to explain. \u201cFor getting you into this mess.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any mess.\u201d Aizawa dismisses.\n\u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d Shouto points out.\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d Toshinori looks like he wants to put a hand on Shouto\u2019s shoulder, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re a very talented kid, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Aizawa insists. \u201cWhat have I told you?\u201d\nShouto stares at his feet and presses his lips together.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d Aizawa repeats, voice underlying with that strange softness he always has when dealing with Shouto\u2019s emotions. \u201cWhat have we talked about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ill.\u201d Shouto mutters. \u201cI can get better.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Aizawa confirms. \u201cYou\u00a0will\u00a0get better, Shouto. It won\u2019t be an instant thing, there will be relapses and fall-backs, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not making progress.\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t know what to do with all the chances Aizawa keeps giving him, all the chances everybody keeps giving him, regardless to who he is. Regardless of what he does. It leaves his head jumbled and makes his feet bounce on the floor.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Fuyumi?\u201d He asks quietly, trying to distract himself from his own mess of emotions.\n\u201cShe left, remember?\u201d Shouto doesn\u2019t remember. He is hollow spaces and echoing rooms, is a mess of here and not here at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t.\u201d Toshinori says when Shouto doesn't answer.\n\u201cIt's not.\u201d Shouto snaps frustrated, suddenly feeling overwhelmingly irritated. He's sick of this, sick of people telling him it's fine \u2013 that it's\u00a0okay\u00a0\u2013 as if Shouto is stupid enough to believe them. As if he's ignorant enough to not realise he's spiralling into crazy, may have already broached the line. \u201cIt's not okay.\u201d his nails bite into his palms and his lungs ache, heart beating too fast in his chest. \u201cNothing is ever going to be okay.\u201d\n\u201cThat's not true.\u201d Aizawa tells him but it's too late because his mind his already started to blur, the room around him starting to spin, starting to ripple. \u201cYou're going to be okay, Shouto.\u201d\nToshinori says something then, voice gentle and muffled, but by the time he finishes his sentence Shouto has floated away, has gone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes a week for him to get himself back under control.\nHis therapist helps him learn new grounding techniques, makes him talk through what his sister said, teaches him ways to stay focused on the here and the now.\nShe tells him it's okay to have episodes, that it's okay to react to bad news like that, that Shouto still isn't crazy.\nMidoriya helps him by hovering quietly, concerned and soft and always filling the silence with inane theories. It reminds him of what Bakugou said a few weeks back about Midoriya being his shadow and the thought makes him feel warm, makes the haze fade, because it\u2019s such a nice idea, such a nice thought. He\u2019s always been scared of the shadows, scared of his father lurking behind corners just waiting to catch him out, but Midoriya is a ball of light, the human embodiment of a hero, and to know Shouto has him in his corner is - is\u00a0something. It\u2019s some feeling he isn\u2019t sure what to do with, some emotion he doesn\u2019t know.\nMidoriya stays close and isn't afraid of Shouto's hazy eyes or his lack of conversations. It's not like Shouto talks much anyway, not like he jumps at the chance to start conversing with others, but they must see that he's off, must note that he's struggling, because they all give him and space and help him at the same time.\nYaoyorozu makes sure he attends meals, makes sure to bring Shouto food if he doesn't show up. She walks him to classes and takes double the notes. She watches him, makes sure he's okay, and is good at distracting him when his thoughts get too much.\nKirishima watches him too, eyes concerned, and between him and Bakugou people get the idea to give him space - to give him room to breathe and collect his thoughts.\nShouto finds himself surrounded by kindness even now, even when he feels like he\u2019s less\u00a0him\u00a0than he\u2019s ever been, even after he attacked a teacher and got pulled out of practical lessons. People still treat him like he deserves better, like he\u2019s always deserved this, and it makes his stomach twist unpleasantly because he doesn\u2019t know what do with what they\u2019re offering. He doesn\u2019t understand why they\u2019re offering it.\nShouto isn\u2019t made for this, isn\u2019t made for smiles that go further than the surface and gentle touches that don\u2019t make him want to flinch away.\nIt\u2019s not until he\u2019s lying in his room, ice glittering on every surface from a nightmare, that a voice in his head whispers\u00a0is this real?\nThe cold seeps in, makes him shudder -\n(\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore your fire forever Shouto.\u201d His father still sounds so angry, so frustrated, even after years of Shouto\u2019s adamant refusal to even light a wisp of a flame. \u201cThis rebellion will stop at some point and you\u2019ll realise how stupid you\u2019ve been - how stupid you\u00a0are. It\u2019s a part of you as much as your ice is.\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t want it. He wishes his mother had burned it out of him when she\u2019d had the chance.)\n\nIs any of this actually reality?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSato knocks on his door the next morning.\n\u201cAizawa-sensei sent me to get you.\u201d The older boy explains after Shouto\u2019s opened it, eyes curious and concerned as they stare at Shouto.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Shouto frowns, mind feeling sluggish. He doesn\u2019t recall having a meeting with Aizawa today - or anyone else for that matter. He had been planning to try and catch up on sleep.\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t turn up for homeroom or literature and I guess he wants to know why.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday.\u201d Shouto points out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have classes on Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cUh.\u201d Sato blinks, head tilting and eyebrows furrowing in concern. \u201cIt\u2019s Monday, Todoroki.\u201d\nThat would explain the quietness of the dorm, then. It would also explain the consistent knocking from a few hours ago.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone get me up?\u201d Shouto asks in confusion.\n\u201cWell I think Iida\u00a0did\u00a0try and get you up, but Midoriya and Uraraka convinced him to leave you be.\u201d Sato shrugs at him, face amused as he recalls the story. \u201cAnd then the both of them and Kirishima somehow managed to convince Aizawa-sensei you were just running late to homeroom. They tried it again with Cementoss, but he wasn\u2019t willing to buy it. So, he spoke to Aizawa, Aizawa glared at us all, and when nobody said anything, he sent me to find you.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t sure which bit of the story to pick apart first, mind reeling slightly. There's something building in him, something pleased and soft, but he ignores it and settles on asking \u201cwhy would they lie about what I was doing?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they care.\u201d Sato says simply. His face holds no signs of doubt, no signs of hesitation, as if it\u2019s obvious that Shouto is someone worthy of caring about, someone worthy of all their protection.\nIt\u2019s confusing but Shouto is too tired to argue it, too tired to demand what they\u2019re trying to do, to beg Sato to tell him what it all means.\nInstead he takes a breath, shuts everything that\u2019s starting to overflow back into himself, and says, \u201cGive me a moment, then.\u201d\nBy the time he\u2019s sitting in Aizawa\u2019s office he feels more distant then not, but he\u2019ll take it over the barrage of questions, of doubt, of confusion. He\u2019d rather sit here and feel nothing then be back in his room, ice steaming away as he doubts his existence.\nAizawa looks unimpressed, eyes regarding Shouto\u2019s appearance flatly, lips pinched.\nShouto refuses to accept that Aizawa looks concerned because it\u2019ll only ruin him. Concern gets people hurt, caring leads to nowhere, and he doesn\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0it. He doesn\u2019t need it.\n(\u201cSweet thing,\u201d His mother tuts. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\nShouto shakes his head, fat tears rolling down his cheeks, and slumps further into his mother\u2019s embrace. \u201cM-make him stop. Please.\u201d\n\u201cI...\u201d his mother\u2019s voice falters, falls silent. Then she tightens her hold and drops a kiss to his head. \u201cI\u2019ll help as much as I can.\u201d\nLater that evening Shouto finds his mother cooking dinner with shaky hands and a drawn face. There are hand shaped bruises on her arms, ones that, when Shouto looks down, match his own.)\n\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Aizawa asks him, fingers tapping against his desk to draw in Shouto\u2019s attention.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need any help.\u201d Shouto says, making sure to keep his tone polite and guard high. He doesn\u2019t want Aizawa\u2019s concern, is tired of having everyone shift around him as if he matters. He liked being quiet, liked being alone, liked not having to second guess everything.\n(He pretends not to notice how forced the words are, how untrue.)\n\u201cShouto.\u201d Aizawa presses. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the issue?\u201d\nThat is the issue,\u00a0Shouto wants to explain.\u00a0Nothing\u2019s going on and things are normal. His father wants to change.\nIf anything, things should be better. He\u2019s seeing a therapist and has friends and his father wants to apologise, wants to make amends. It\u2019s what he used to dream of once, what he used to picture\u00a0getting better\u00a0as, but now he\u2019s here and it just feels like things are getting worse.\nHe thought he was hollow inside, thought he was nothing but an empty shell, but something in him is rotting, is consuming him. It\u2019s seeping through all of him like oil and his fire catches on it, desperate and fuelled by it all, whilst his ice repels it, trying to force it away as it coats his insides.\nAll he wanted, really, was the truth.\nHe wanted people to believe him and - well, people\u00a0do\u00a0believe him, are willing to support him, but.\nBut.\nWhen the words fall out of the circle of people around him they\u2019re scoffed at, laughed at, dismissed as crazed ramblings and-\nHis mother is stuck in a hospital and the thought of his father still terrifies her. Nobody bar the doctors and his family know why she\u2019s in there, know what she did to him, what their father must have done to her.\nOne of his brothers is long gone and Shouto barely see\u2019s the other, barely knows him now, and Fuyumi -\nFuyumi is still trying to keep them all together out of the desperate emotion that stems from the idea that under it all, under everything they've done to each other, there must still be love there.\nShouto learnt better when it came to love, got taught better, but they all are so different. There are so many spaces between their similarities that it\u2019s exhausting.\nHe wants people to stop seeing Endeavor as a hero, regardless to what his father thinks he can do to make amends for it.\nHe wants people to stop looking at his old man and feeling awe, feeling excitement, feeling\u00a0hope.\nShouto spent years living with the man, living with the number two hero, scared to become a hero himself. He\u2019s spent nights surrounded by the darkness of his room, the silence deafening and his muscles aching, waiting for anyone to come and save him.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to piece his thoughts together enough, how to pull everything he feels in and flatten it out. He doesn\u2019t know how to find the words he needs to explain everything.\nIt\u2019s easier to say, \u201cthings are fine.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easier to school his face into a neutral expression and keep it there, to blink innocently and furrow his eyebrows in apparent confusion. \u201cI\u2019m just tired, sensei. I slept in and then must\u2019ve fallen back asleep after telling Midoriya I\u2019d be a bit late.\u201d\nAizawa stares at him for a moment, eyes taking in what he looks like and Shouto knows what he sees. Shouto is tired, has dark bags under his eyes from sleepless nights and his skin is paler than normal from all the time he\u2019s recently spent shut up in his dorm room.\n\u201cYou know where I am.\u201d Aizawa says, tension draining slightly from his shoulders as he believes the lie, and it makes Shouto feel terrible. It makes him feel sick.\n\u201cOf course. Sorry for making you worry.\u201d\n\u201cGo to class.\u201d Aizawa tuts. \u201cDon\u2019t be late again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe longer he pretends things are okay, the louder the voice inside his head gets.\n\nIs this real? Would any of this really happen to you?\n\nHe lets himself join in with the class after their lessons are over and they seem delighted, seem happy and chatty and tell him jokes that he doesn\u2019t understand. He listens as best he can, tries to focus and understand, but then thinks,\n\nDo you really need to understand it if it\u2019s not real?\n\nHe goes to the remedial courses to get his provisional licence and works with Bakugou, a teacher always watching from the stands, and he starts to let his fire roam free. He doesn\u2019t let himself hold back, doesn\u2019t let himself get distracted by thoughts of his father because,\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you use your fire? It\u2019s not like it can really hurt anyone here.\n\nHis grades deteriorate slightly but he can\u2019t bring himself to care, can\u2019t bring himself to pay attention in class when he feels so far away from it all.\nHe sits in the library one day, trying to force himself to snap out of it, books piled up in front of him, but the words shift and wobble on the page and it does nothing but give him a headache. At this point he starts to think\u00a0maybe I should get help.\nBut then, when his therapist says \u201cHow are you doing Shouto? How are things?\u201d he finds it easier to lie, finds it easier to force himself to believe the words he says over admitting to the truth.\nWhat\u2019s the truth anyway?\u00a0He thinks to himself.\u00a0Endeavor said you\u2019re a liar and here you are, lying to everyone who cares about you on a daily basis.\n\nYou are nothing but the monster he\u2019s taught you to be and you will never be anything but that.\n\nHe sits with Midoriya during movie nights, allows himself to slump against the older boy when he feels too dizzy. \u201cAlright?\u201d Midoriya whispers, shifting to accommodate where Shouto is now pressed against him.\nHe considers saying\u00a0no\u00a0for a brief moment, considers letting the stagnant water inside him overflow and drown them both, but he already choked and drowned in it long ago. He is nothing but a floating mind trapped inside a body that isn\u2019t his and it\u2019s so much simpler to say \u201ctired,\u201d then to begin to explain how Shouto is nothing but an animated corpse.\n\u201cYou can sleep if you want.\u201d Midoriya offers, warm and smelling of apples, fresh and sweet and pure. Shouto hums in reply, not too sure if he\u2019s even able to sleep at this point.\nYaoyorozu pulls him aside with Iida the next day.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d She asks quietly, sharing a long look with Iida when Shouto nods at her.\n\u201cDo you need help studying?\u201d Iida frowns at him. \u201cI can help tutor you if needed, Shouto-kun.\u201d\nHe thinks of his failing grades, of the way his father won\u2019t care, of the way the words don\u2019t seem to be words anymore and says \u201cplease. If you don\u2019t mind - that\u2019d be helpful.\u201d\n\u201cFirst Midoriya,\u201d Iida tuts. \u201cNow you. When will you two start learning to come to us?\u201d\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve asked.\u201d Yaoyorozu sighs when Shouto blinks at them both blankly. She reaches out slowly and grips his bicep, frowning when she does it, squeezing at where Shouto knows hardwired muscle used to be. He meets her eyes, challenging her to do something (and maybe, somewhere, Shouto wants her to do something. Wants her to force his hand.), but she just squeezes once more before letting go. \u201cIf you need help then you need to speak up.\u201d\nHe thinks about saying\u00a0help me, then\u00a0but Iida starts talking about\u00a0study schedules\u00a0and\u00a0helpless friends,\u00a0so he lets the words fall away into nothingness.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomewhere between Shouto attending his first remedial course and now, Midoriya has somehow been sucked into a different world of internships and patrolling.\nShouto watches him leave, Kirishima walking next to him, the both of them engaged in an animated conversation. Kaminari stands next to Shouto, waving and shouting goodbyes whilst Hagakure\u2019s gloved hand blows kisses towards Uraraka and Asui.\n\u201cI\u2019m so jealous.\u201d Ashido complains. \u201cThey\u2019re getting to do so much cool stuff.\u201d\nShouto thinks of the stories Midoriya has told him, of the small girl and the villains he\u2019s met, and isn\u2019t sure if\u00a0cool\u00a0is the word he would use.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re brave.\u201d Jirou says. \u201cYou heard what Uraraka was saying the other night. I can\u2019t imagine being caught up in all of that already.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be out there.\u201d Orijo sighs. \u201cBut I can\u2019t find anyone willing to take on an intern.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find something.\u201d Yaoyorozu comes to stand next to Shouto by the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure we all will.\u201d\n\u201cYeah right.\u201d Kaminari scoffs. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the best ones available.\u201d\n\u201cHey Todoroki.\u201d Sero calls, forcing Shouto to look away from Midoriya\u2019s slowing retreating form.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shouto notes that Ashido is throwing Sero a\u00a0panicked\u00a0look and frowns in confusion.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get Endeavor to take on interns?\u201d Shouto blinks at his words, skin suddenly feeling too tight around him, the air too thick. \u201cDoes his office not have any spare time for us?\u201d\nShouto had blocked his father\u2019s number after Fuyumi\u2019s visit, after the\u00a0missed call\u00a0count had started to grow, and was currently in the midst of practising that Endeavor didn't exist.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto answers flatly, fingers twitching at his side. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHave you tried asking?\u201d Sero asks, voice growing excited as if his idea is something amazing. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure if you did then-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto interrupts. Everything around him feels too close, bodies too near and ceiling too low, and he heads towards the front door, needing air, needing space.\n\u201cDude-\u201d Sero calls to his back but Shouto ignores him, hand pulling the door open and cold air hitting his face.\n\u201cShut up you idiot.\u201d He hears Ashido hiss. \u201cLearn to take a hint you -\u201d\nThe door shuts behind him with a\u00a0thud\u00a0and the noise from inside cuts off, leaving his ears filled with static.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething happens during the internships that leave Kirishima, Uraraka, Asui, and Midoriya notably\u00a0different.\nShouto observes them, not knowing how to offer comfort, and chooses to hang\u00a0back when the class swarms in.\nHe watches their new found hesitance, watches the guilty hunch to their shoulders, and is reminded of his mother.\n(Shouto listens as Touya argues with their mother, voice angry and thin. His mother never raises her voice in return and Shouto wishes she would. He wishes that she\u2019d shout back, that she\u2019d fight, that she\u2019d do more.\nIt\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s not Touya\u2019s fault.\nHis father opens the door and Shouto tenses, meets his father's steeled gaze, and they both glance to where Touya\u2019s voice rings out.\n\u201cYou could\u00a0leave.\u201d His brother shouts. \u201cYou could take us and go. You could take Shouto and let him live a normal life before it\u2019s too late. Our\u00a0father\u00a0is disgusting and you\u2019re just letting him do this to us all!\u201d\nHis father stares back at him and raises an eyebrow as if to say\u00a0can you believe what he\u2019s saying. He looks at Shouto as if Shouto is on his side, as if Shouto can understand the reasoning behind anything he does, and he's never felt more different than his father.\n\u201cThis, boy.\u201d Endeavor\u2019s voice is amused, is almost gentle, and it makes the hair on his arms stand on end. \u201cIs why you\u2019re my favourite. You\u2019d never insult the Todoroki name like the rest of them do.\u201d)\nHe wishes he could do more for them but Shouto has never been one to look after people. If it were bandaging a burn he could manage, maybe, but Shouto\u2019s never had to deal with others emotions in such a close range until now.\nHe\u2019s used to Midoriya filling in all the blanks for him, on telling him what people mean and why they\u2019re behaving that way, but the other boy is quiet, is tired, and it makes concern well up inside him.\n\u201cGood luck today.\u201d Midoriya says quietly as Shouto grabs his bag. \u201cDon\u2019t get too hurt out there.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Shouto reassures and then, belatedly, \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about it Shouto-kun.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s smile is smaller than Shouto\u2019s used to but still just as genuine, just as sweet.\n\u201cFeel better.\u201d Shouto offers, uncertain of if it\u2019s the right thing to say.\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes, big and green and soft, shimmer slightly in the morning light. \u201cAnd you.\u201d The older boy returns, as if he can see through the act Shouto\u2019s trying to pull. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings feel different - feel spacey and distant - as if gravity is losing its hold on them all.\nTime blurs into a mix of too long and not long enough and he can\u2019t be sure when he\u2019s asleep or when he\u2019s awake.\n\u201cI\u2019m going on holiday for a week.\u201d His therapists apologises. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be back soon enough - please don\u2019t hesitate to seek help if you need it, Shouto.\u201d\nPeople keep telling him to ask for help, to speak up, and he wishes someone would notice that he\u2019s choking on all that he can\u2019t say. He can\u2019t do it by himself, is broken and helpless and unused to speaking up.\n(\u201cAre you even trying?\u201d His father snarls, spit flying from his mouth and sizzling in the crackling fire.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m trying.\u201d Shouto wheezes back, arms clenched around his stomach and blood on his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re just-\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d His father sends a hot gust of flames his way and Shouto flinches backwards, the heat searing even though it doesn\u2019t touch his skin. \u201cBe quiet and\u00a0focus, boy.\u201d)\nNobody asks and maybe it\u2019s for the best. Maybe this was how it way always going to be, how it was going to end.\nMaybe he won\u2019t ever get past that moment where the skin around his eye itched and burned as he was left shaking on the floor, muscles twitching and chest heaving, his father looming over him as he thought\u00a0would it be such a bad thing to be killed?\nHe\u2019s been untethered from the ground, hollowed out and emptied, and he\u2019s floating away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto comes back to himself to find he\u2019s sitting on the dorm roof, knees digging into the asphalt below him and bits of gravel embedded in his hands.\nIn front of him is the edge of the building and he blinks once, twice, but can\u2019t recall how he got up here.\nAbove him the night stars are covered by thick, dark clouds. A cold wind bites at his skin and Shouto notes that he\u2019s shivering and that his hot side won\u2019t respond to him, that his cold side won\u2019t respond to him, and-\nSmoke is rising from under one hand and snow encompasses the other.\nHe looks towards the edge of the building again and thinks\u00a0it\u2019s now or never.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFinding the nerve to seek out help instead of waiting for it to come to him makes him feel oddly sick. Aizawa has been busy recently, All Might taking over their home room for the past few days, and Shouto doesn\u2019t want to bother him but he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to go to anybody else.\nThe first time Shouto see\u2019s Eri it\u2019s just a glimpse - grey hair, skinny arms, and a young, young face. He\u2019s heard a lot about her from Midoriya, the older boy seemingly growing animated at the thought of her being at Yuuei, but to see just how young she is, just how blank faced she is, rattles him.\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Aizawa shuts the door of the staff room, concealing the girl from sight. \u201cSorry I haven\u2019t had a chance to catch up with you yet.\u201d Aizawa looks exhausted, hair lank and dark bags under his eyes. \u201cHow have things been?\u201d\nNot good, Shouto wants to say.\u00a0Not good. Really weird - bad, maybe. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real and-\nAizawa looks like his exhaustion runs bone deep. He must be stressed, must be busy, spread thin between the aftermath of what happened and trying to act like everything's normal. He wants to honest with Aizawa, wants to trust him and beg for help, but Aizawa reminds Shouto of wilting flowers, their colours faded and petals falling.\n(\u201cFuyumi?\u201d Shouto whispers in a thick voice.\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d She tells him, running a hand through his hair and trailing her fingers along the bandage that covers his eye. \u201cEverything's going to be okay now, Shou.\u201d\n\u201cI-I want mom.\u201d He presses his face further into her shoulder. \u201cI want her.\u201d\nShouto had come back from hospital yesterday evening with a thick white pad over his left eye and a bandage securing it to his face. The doctors said words like\u00a0nerve damage\u00a0and\u00a0scarring\u00a0but Shouto hadn't known what they meant, hadn't been able to focus on anything besides the lack of his parents with him, the lack of his mother.\nFuyumi, as the eldest, had been left in charge of looking after Shouto. She seemed to understand more about what was happening then he ever could.\n\u201cIt'll be okay.\u201d Fuyumi repeats in a thin voice. Shouto isn't sure which one of them she's trying to convince more.)\nHe backs out on telling Aizawa at the last second, his mother\u2019s eyes, tired and sad, flashing in his mind.\n\u201cThings have been okay.\u201d He can\u2019t quite meet Aizawa\u2019s eyes as he says it, the lie bubbling like acid and dripping onto their relationship, onto the faith Aizawa has in him. He can feel it start to dissolve in front of him and sees the walls start to shift around him, the air turning into static.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Aizawa sounds relieved, sounds genuinely pleased, and Shouto takes a mental step back in the face of it.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he feels himself ask.\n(\u201cDon't you want to be a hero anymore, Shouto?\u201d his mother's voice is disappointed-)\n\u201cThings are...\u201d Aizawa pauses and something desperate wells up in Shouto.\u00a0Lie to me\u00a0he begs internally.\u00a0Tell me you're fine. \u201cThey've been better.\u201d Aizawa tells him quietly. \u201cI've been better. But things are going to be okay.\u201d\nIf Shouto had felt bad for lying before he's not quite sure what to label the guilt welling up within him as. He can feel something inside him turn thick, as if everything good Aizawa had placed within him is has suddenly turned into something disgusting, something ugly.\n\u201cI'm glad you're okay.\u201d his voice says, distant and thin. \u201cI heard what happened from Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I imagined you would. Tell him and Kirishima to stop running their mouths. I'll be down to talk to you all soon.\u201d The walls drip down onto the floor around them and in their place is a grainy film. \u201cI'll speak to you later as well, okay? We'll have a proper chat.\u201d\nShouto blinks, eyelids heavy and skin feeling too thin. He tries breathing in for three, out for three, but counting becomes difficult. Listening becomes difficult.\nAizawa looks to be saying something but the buzzing that has been slowly rising surrounds him and when he blinks once, twice, it's to find himself outside the Yuuei building, the bitter wind biting at his skin just as it did the other night.\n\u201cShouto-kun?\" Ashido\u2019s voice is dim. Her face, now in front of him, is mostly confused but also concerned. \u201cAlright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d he replies automatically. He notes that Kirishima is also here, as well as Sero, and Bakugou, and -\n\u201cDid you speak to Aizawa-sensei?\u201d Kirishima asks.\n\u201cHow did you know I was going to speak to him?\u201d Shouto asks, mind feeling unfocused. There\u2019s a gap between him and the others and, although none of them are moving, Shouto can slowly see it start to grow. The floor is shifting underneath him and the distance stretches, swells and morphs, and Shouto has no idea why nobody else is more concerned.\n\u201cYou told me you were going there this morning.\u201d Kirishima answers slowly which - which is difficult, because Shouto can\u2019t make out if he\u2019s doing it to be kind to him or whether the reality he\u2019s in is stretching out the words to torment him. What Kirishima\u00a0said also doesn\u2019t make any sense because Shouto hadn\u2019t\u00a0seen\u00a0anyone this morning. He had got up and made his way over to Aizawa without a word to a soul.\nKirishima wouldn\u2019t lie though, would he? The red haired boy has no reason to make the story up, which means that Shouto\u2019s lost time and hasn\u2019t even realised or -\n(\u201cShouto?\u201d Fuyumi\u2019s voice calls through the wall. \u201cAre you there?\u201d\nShouto doesn't reply.\nHe sits cross-legged facing the wall he normally leans against with a blurry mind, the bruises on his arms throbbing, and wonders why his sister doesn't hate him for driving their mom crazy, for stealing all of their father's attention.\n\u201cI'm worried about you, Shou. Please answer me.\u201d\nShouto watches the wall and he doesn't reply.)\n\u201cYou're shaking, Todoroki.\u201d Sero points out and Shouto watches as Ashido and Kirishma share a concerned look. It gives him an odd sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\u201cDo you need me to take you to the nurse?\u201d Ashido says quietly. He hears her voice echo in his head and then, when he blinks, they're sitting in classroom with Kirishima and Ashido frowning at him and Yaoyorozu by his side, quiet and firm in her observations.\nA hand touches his arm and he jolts (he doesn't flinch, never flinches, because flinching is a weakness. Feeling stuff is a weakness. Fighting to stay here in a world that doesn't even feel real, a world that shifts and morphs and throws Shouto at where it feels fit, is weakness.)\n(he presses his cheek to the floor and thinks-)\n\u201cCome on fuck face.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s grip is firm, hand curled around one of his arms as he half drags Shouto away. \u201cCan't have you fainting all over the fucking place.\u201d\nShouto isn't going to faint. He isn't going to faint because he's going to float, is going to fade into the static that lurks behind every sentence, and all that'll be left is a body with a scar that holds the story to where his life started to unravel. He's going to float into nothing and his body will be left to age and decay before its given back to the earth, festering and empty just like he's always been.\n\u201cShould we get Aizawa-sensei?\u201d Kirishima is still here, trailing after them like Shouto's latest freak out is worthy of attention. He wishes they'd stop, wishes that his therapist hadn't taught him about grounding. he wishes\u00a0that the small desperate part of him didn't latch onto Bakugou\u2019s grip as an excuse to stay here. He wants to go, wants to be let go, wants to lay in the grass and let the earth turn him into the winter flowers, small and delicate and alive in the bitter cold.\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d Bakugou sounds angry, always sounds angry, but lately there's been another level to his voice. He sounds concerned, angry and frustrated both at Shouto for being like this and at himself for caring. \u201cI don't fucking know - he's busy, right? He's got that kid and-\u201d\n\u201cShouto is his kid too.\u201d Kirishima answers. \u201cHe's been helping him.\u201d\n\u201cFucking - let's just get him sat down.\u201d Bakugou snaps, panic displaying itself as anger, and yet the squeeze he gives to Shouto's arm is nothing but reassuring.\nHe wishes that Bakugou was still as angry and volatile as he used to be, wishes that the other boy would grip hard enough to bruise, hard enough to stain him, a reminder that Shouto is real, that he's a canvas to be used and painted into whatever is wanted by the person holding the brush.\n(\u201cYou can be better than him, Shouto.\u201d His father says in a proud voice. \u201cWith both mine and your mother's Quirks you can surpass him- you can become the best. We'll show that bastard that the Todoroki\u2019s are the most powerful, the most important part of the hero society.\u201d\nShouto imagines that his words are meant to be inspiring, that they're meant to invoke something in him that will snap him out of his melancholy, but it just makes Shouto feel sick.\nOn screen is the video of All Might, the same one he used to watch with his mother when she was still-\nI don't want to be a hero, Shouto thinks as his father points out weaknesses in All Might\u2019s form.\u00a0Please, I just want to be normal. Let me be normal, please.\n\u201cAll Might may have power, Shouto, but his Quirk can tire him out easily. Your fire with your ice? You could be unstoppable one day, if you just applied yourself.\u201d\nI don't want to be a hero, Shouto thinks. His ears ring with the thought and static crawls across his skin.\u00a0I don't want to be like you.)\nMidoriya\u2019s face is soft, cheeks flushed and big eyes watery, worried.\u00a0It's okay\u00a0his lips say. As always, without Shouto ever having to say it, Midoriya knows what's going on.\u00a0Count to three. Breathe in and count to three.\nInhale and hold for one-\n(\u201cI want to be someone you're proud of.\u201d he tells his mom. She doesn\u2019t respond, eyes distant and grip on his hand lax.)\nTwo-\n(\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Yaoyorozu presses. \u201cAre you even paying attention to what I\u2019m saying?\u201d)\nThree -\n(\u201cMum wanted me to be a hero.\u201d He says quietly to Fuyumi. There's a wall separating them both but if Shouto closes his eyes he can let his head grow fuzzy, let it paint the picture of his sister sitting in the hallway opposite him.\n\u201cShe did.\u201d Fuyumi agrees. \u201cShe was always so proud of you Shouto. I know it's not okay, that nothing about it is okay, but I know that she was always proud of who you were.\u201d\nAnd who am I?\u00a0Shouto wants to ask.\u00a0Who am I but my father's son, my father's project.\n\u201cHe wants me to be a hero.\u201d Shouto says, words feeling thick in his mouth.\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d Fuyumi offers after a beat. In his mind she reaches out to touch his hand, not holding but just simply pressing their fingertips together, her fingers gentle and cold to his left side.\n\u201cI want mom.\u201d his memories of her have started to blur, colours washed out and paint strokes dripping into each other. He thinks that the distorted version of her is still the best thing he's ever known.\n\u201cMe too, Shouto.\u201d)\n\u201cKnowing you.\u201d Shouto breathes out, eyes glued to Midoriya's face. There are freckles on his nose and different shades of green in his eyes, petty and pure. \u201cIs the happiest I've ever felt.\u201d\nMidoriya smiles and looks at Shouto as if the world he's created around them isn't fraying apart. \u201cI wish you could always be happy.\u201d Midoriya tells him, voice gentle and soft, and then, \u201cdo you know where you are?\u201d\nShouto doesn't know is the thing.\nHe had stopped knowing a while ago, maybe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t.\u201d Midoriya reassures. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d There is no doubt in Shouto\u2019s mind. \u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Midoriya agrees, smile soft and eyes sad. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Shouto.\u201d\nAround them the world is faint, full of shifting colours and muffled sounds, but Midoriya has always seemed to terribly real to him, so sharp and clear.\nHe couldn\u2019t tell Aizawa earlier, couldn\u2019t breathe a word of it to anyone else, but Midoriya is different. Midoriya is gentle and kind, is Shouto\u2019s first ever friend, and his hands are warm where they hold his own. It\u2019s easy here, in the hazy bubble, to whisper, \u201cI need help.\u201d and not be afraid of the ripple affect his words will have.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Midoriya agrees, thumb rubbing over the back of Shouto\u2019s hand. \u201cI know, Shouto. We\u2019ll get you help, okay?\u201d and then, after a beat. \u201cI have to go now.\u201d\n\u201cGo where?\u201d Shouto tightens his grip on Midoriya, eyes stinging. Around them is nothing but static and he fears that if Midoriya goes he won\u2019t come back, that if he lets go of Shouto\u2019s hands then Shouto will lose himself to the nothingness.\n\u201cNot far.\u201d Midoriya soothes. \u201cAizawa is going to help, okay?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy.\u201d Shouto disagrees.\n\u201cNever too busy for you,\u201d Aizawa is there then, shooting Midoriya a look before turning his gaze back to Shouto. \u201cI told you that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\nMidoriya let's go then, and just as Shouto thought, he fizzles from existence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s schizophrenic.\u201d a voice says. \u201cI just think he needs help - professional help, and maybe it\u2019s best if we pull him-\u201d\n\u201cDo you really think taking him away from Yuuei will do him any good?\u201d\n\u201cWell keeping him here surely hasn\u2019t made things better, has it?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d A different voice inputs. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in any state to decide what and where is best for Shouto. He needs to make that decision himself.\u201d\n\u201cNo offence, Yagi, but the boy is clearly unfit to make any decisions. He was barely lucid from what I heard.\u201d\n\u201cThat.\u201d a familiar voice cuts in, tired and flat. \u201cIs because he was exhausted. He hadn\u2019t slept for\u00a0days, hadn't slept properly for weeks,\u00a0and I am willing to take full responsibility for not watching him closer-\u201d\n\u201cShouta,\u201d a voice tuts. \u201cYou\u2019re not to blame. You were away on a job and it\u2019s not your responsibility to monitor every student constantly.\u201d\n\u201cHe is my responsibility.\u201d the voice rebukes. \u201cHe\u2019s- I told him he could come to me and I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for this conversation, I think. Taking Shouto away from Yuuei and his friends may cause more damage in the long run.\u201d\n\u201cHe should go home to his family.\u201d the first voice explains. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure why you keep refusing to accept this as the best option but I\u2019m-\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not the best option. His father is a fucking-\u201d\n\u201cToshinori,\u201d someone warns. \u201cNot here.\u201d\n\u201cHis father is the number one hero and, like I\u2019ve mentioned countless of times, the boy\u2019s\u00a0father. My patient needs to be looked after and surrounded by people who care for him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why staying at Yuuei may be the best option for him.\u201d a patient voice explains. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to offend your medical opinion, but as the headmaster of this school I am aware of the child's home life, and currently Shouto and his father don\u2019t exactly see eye to eye.\u201d\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. Can\u2019t you people see that sending him home is for the-\u201d\n\u201cHe stays here.\u201d someone interrupts, this voice new, softly spoken and comforting. \u201cIf Yuuei are offering it to him, then Shouto stays.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the first voice says haughtily. \u201cBut just who are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m his sister,\u201d the voice returns smoothly. \u201cHis emergency contact,\u201d something cold touches his hand and it makes Shouto sag further into the sheets. \u201cAnd, as my\u00a0father\u00a0is currently outside the country on official business, his legal guardian.\u201d\nThe voices drone on but Shouto loses focus on what they\u2019re saying, the fingers curled around his allowing him to drift off to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto feels different when he wakes up, limbs heavy from tiredness and medication, and when he blinks his eyes open it\u2019s to see Aizawa asleep in a chair next to his, yellow sleeping bag covering him like a blanket.\n\u201cShouto,\u201d a voice breathes, familiar and soft. \u201cHi.\u201d\nFuyumi sits on his other side, face tired and hair falling out of her bun.\n\u201cHello.\u201d Shouto\u2019s voice is raspy and weak but his sister relaxes at the sound of it.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d he murmurs softly, head lulling into the soft pillow under his head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d His sister tuts, fingers squeezing his.\n\u201cI thought me lying was for the best?\u201d Shouto says before he can quite register it. Fuyumi tenses next to him but Shouto refuses to take the words back.\nHis mind feels clearer then it has in weeks, body solid and real, and the smell of the medical wing familiar to him.\n\u201cI suppose I did say that, didn\u2019t I.\u201d his sister sighs, regret flashing over her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d she meets his eyes, holds his gaze, and Shouto remembers when they could only speak with a wall between them. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Shouto.\u201d\nShe hesitates but then there\u2019s a hand in his hair, skinny fingers tugging lightly on the strands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d Fuyumi sounds frustrated with herself. \u201cHe just. I guess I just didn\u2019t want people to know about how broken our family is - not when he was willing to change it.\u201d\n\u201cI want people to know.\u201d Shouto feels his eyes burn so he lets them flutter shut. \u201cI never want to see him again.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d his sister makes a shushing noise, familiar to the one his mother used to make. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I was selfish and desperate for things to be normal that I said things I shouldn\u2019t have. I listened to him because he never speaks to me, never acknowledges me, and when he said sorry I thought - well, I don\u2019t know what I thought.\u201d she tugs lightly on a knot, fingers unravelling\u00a0it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think, and I didn\u2019t stop to consider how it would\u2019ve come across to you. I didn\u2019t realise things were this bad for you.\u201d\nShe presses down on his head and he realises what she means, realises that he never told her about his dissociation or how he sometimes feels like he\u2019s not here at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He tells her honestly. He knows Fuyumi has only wanted the best for them all, has only ever wanted to understand and to help, and Shouto had given her nothing and expected her to know. He is in the wrong, is the one who doesn\u2019t know how to breathe without having to remind himself to count to three.\n\u201cNo.\u201d his sister argues. \u201cIt\u2019s not, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI forgive you, then.\u201d Shouto returns just as quickly. \u201cI never blamed you.\u201d\nFor me, for mom, for what our dad did.\u00a0He doesn't say. You were never to blame, not really.\nHe understands that now.\nHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever really understand\u00a0why she wants them all to try so much, why she wants to believe in all of them together as a family, but he understands that it was never her fault.\nHe thinks that, maybe, he can start to understand how\u00a0it was never his fault, either.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d She says, words fast and coming out wrong, neither of them used to the statement. It makes him tense up, makes something in him grow soft, makes him want to try harder to be better. \u201cI should have always told you that, huh? I do Shouto - You and Natsu are all I have, really. I love you both.\u201d\n\u201cYou too.\u201d Shouto mutters cheeks feeling warm, eyes dropping shyly.\nHe feels more aware now then he has in- well, since his sister visited last. He wonders where he went wrong previously, wonders why he let himself get sucked under the tides of his mind.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Fuyumi asks again.\nHe considers her question more carefully this time, takes in his heavy arms and weighted legs, the fog in his mind that's only caused by medication, the steady\u00a0thud thud thud\u00a0of his heart. He's tired, is always so tired, but, \u201cbetter.\u201d he chews on his next sentence, blinking his eyes open to meet his sisters searching gaze. \u201cI'm tired and - and me, I guess. But I feel better than before.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not surprised.\u201d She let's go of his hair with a small smile. \u201cYou hadn't slept for over thirty-six hours, apparently.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d he mutters, trying to remember the past few weeks. They all blur and mesh into one long stretch of time, days and hours feeling like seconds and minutes, feeling like weeks and months. \u201cI have issues with sleeping.\u201d he admits, and then decides to say, \u201cI've always had issues with sleeping. After mom.\nFuyumi blinks, surprised and regretful. \u201cI never knew that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you know?\u201d He asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not like,\u201d\u00a0you saw me, it\u2019s not like you knew me that well, it\u2019s not like our rooms were close to each other,\u00a0\u201cI was willing to tell people.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d His sister agrees quietly. \u201cBut I wish I had known, Shouto. I had no idea how bad things were for you, even after you moved out. I had no idea until I got a call the other day.\u201d\n\u201cI let things get out of control.\u201d It\u2019s easy to admit it to Fuyumi when they\u2019re both sitting in the quietness of this room, the morning sun shining through the blinds and the white of the walls making everything feel more serine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could get better and then I thought, if I couldn\u2019t\u00a0get better anyway, I could at least control how bad it got.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a silence then, Shouto looking at the white sheets below him and his sisters gaze heavy and considering on the side of his face.\n\u201cI remember feeling like that once.\u201d Fuyumi tells him. He looks up at her words, blinking uncertainly \u201cI remember feeling like that a lot, actually. Especially when you were younger.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Shouto asks, heart beat thudding in his fingertips and something warm and sad growing in him.\nHe forgets that sometimes, underneath all of their differences. is the same foundation their father laid within them, the structures their mother helped build. They are so different and yet so similar, orbiting around the same worries, the same actions.\nIt\u2019s easy to seclude himself, to picture himself alone and lost, abandoned on his own island of isolation. It\u2019s easy to feel alone, to let the loneliness fester and devour him, but maybe he needs to stop letting the rolling seas inside of him chase him away from everyone else. There are so many bridges trying to reach out to him, so many people trying to help him, that Shouto sometimes forgets that it takes equal effort from both parts. He considers how it would feel to reach out himself, considers how, if he built himself up and reached over the rolling waves, pushed through the clouds, then maybe, he could meet Fuyumi half way.\n\u201cReally.\u201d She confirms. \u201cI know we don\u2019t have much, Shouto. But we have each other.\u201d and then, \"you have me.\"\nThe broken pieces of his family, charred and splintered, and yet still there. He isn\u2019t as\u00a0gone\u00a0as he thought, isn\u2019t as\u00a0before\u00a0as he is\u00a0after\u00a0now, and, staring into Fuyumi\u2019s grey, familiar eyes, he stops trying to picture the image of his mother. He looks at the red tips of her hair, her rounded cheekbones, cheekbones that match Endeavor's. They all have the same naturally furrowed eyebrows, the same anger inside them. \nShouto takes a breath and looks at her glasses, at the freckles she has, at the earrings dangling from her ears. He looks at her and sees her for who she is, sees all of the parts that make Fuyumi entirely and completely her own person.\n(\u201cIt\u2019s yours! Your Quirk- not\u00a0his!\u201d)\nShe smiles, brighter than his mother ever could and kinder than his father ever has. Inside, somewhere, somehow, is somebody who is just him. Shouto may be a mesh of fire and ice, may be hollowed and broken and angry and selfish, but they are traits for him to build on, things for him to grow into. He can take what they are and make them into what he wants, because he is the one holding the brush, the one who could tether himself to the earth, if only he\u00a0tried.\n\u00a0(\u201cWhen are you going to stop running from this?\u201d Endeavor asks him, forehead creased, and eyes confused, posture angry. \u201cWhen are you going to stop pretending that your fire isn\u2019t a part of you?\u201d)\nHis sister makes a sad sound, something panicked, and she reaches out to brush his cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d She says, alarmed. \u201cShouto, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not though, is the thing. It has never been okay, and he isn\u2019t okay but-\nThe beginnings of spring are starting to appear in the city, the sun starting to warm and the blossoms on the trees starting to bud, starting to bloom. He has his sister sitting next to him, Aizawa behind him, and a class of people who want to like him for who he is, who he could be.\nHe has a future, somewhere, and maybe that could be okay. Maybe moving on from his father, from his past, is okay because there\u2019s more waiting for him then the training room back at his family home. There is more waiting for him outside of the legacy his father forced upon him.\nHe presses his face into the pillow below him and holds back a sob. He doesn\u2019t know how to cry properly anymore, tears and comfort long being burnt out of him, but that could be okay, too, if he let it. Shouto doesn\u2019t need to know how to cry as long as he does it, let\u2019s everything that\u2019s been building out, lets himself overflow without freezing the leaking water to the sides of him.\nAbsently he\u2019s aware of Aizawa\u2019s voice, of Fuyumi\u2019s, and they\u2019re distant in a different way, distant because of Shouto\u2019s hitching breaths instead of the ringing of his mind.\nArms tug at him gently and Shouto lets himself be pulled up, lets his head drop onto a shoulder, familiar black hair falling into his vision. Aizawa\u2019s voice is gentle in a way he hasn\u2019t let himself accept before, hands warm and firm as they rub his back.\n\"It's okay,\" Aizawa tells him. \"You're okay.\"\nHe is nothing but who he was, who he always has been, and for the first time he considers that maybe, just maybe, that could be okay, too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEpilogue:\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking come on,\u201d Bakugou breathes. \u201cThey best not fucking draw this out. I just want to fucking know.\u201d He\u2019s clutching at Shouto\u2019s arm \u2013 not that Shouto thinks the other boy realises \u2013 grip slightly too\u00a0tight but not hard enough to hurt him. Shouto lets him hold on, focusing on where the tired looking spokesman is reading through a list of pleasantries, voice slow and drawling.\n\u201cAnd so, the remedial courses are over,\u201d the man says, eyes rolling. \u201cAnd yet here I still am \u2013 having to go through all of this\u00a0again\u00a0just so that the few who didn't pass,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking blast him.\u201d Bakugou snarls. \u201cFucking rude piece of shit.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t blast him.\u201d Shouto murmurs quietly, meeting Bakugou\u2019s eyes without hesitation when the other boy turns his glare onto him. \u201cBlast the results out of his hand instead.\u201d\nBakugou snorts, hand squeezing Shouto\u2019s arm absently. He nods towards where Shiketsu High School are standing and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get your good friend over there to make them blow our way?\u201d\nThey both turn to look at Inasa who spots them staring instantly, offering an enthusiastic wave, a smile lighting up his face. He looks like he\u2019s going to shout hello to them in the middle of the speech which would be \u2013 funny, maybe, but also counterproductive. The spokesman doesn\u2019t need any more excuses to keep dragging this on. Luckily Camie nods her head at them politely as she stamps on Inasa\u2019s foot, forcing him to focus and turn towards the front of the room.\n\u201cI think,\u201d Shouto mutters after a moments consideration. \u201cIt\u2019d be funnier if you blew them out of his hands.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m more likely blow his hands off.\u201d Bakugou scoffs. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking pissing me off.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019d be funny, too.\u201d\n\u201cHow about you ice them out of his hands?\u201d\n\u201cMy ice would\u00a0freeze\u00a0the results to his hands-\u201c\n\u201cHow about,\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice rings from behind them, hushed and flat. \u201cYou two pay\u00a0attention\u00a0instead of talking amongst yourselves.\u201d\nBakugou mutters something under his breath, rude and grumbled, but Shouto and \u2013 luckily enough \u2013 Aizawa pretend not to notice.\n\u201cSorry, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d Shouto twists his head to give Aizawa a small smile, part of him relieved to see that Aizawa isn\u2019t actually angry. Not that he thought Aizawa\u00a0would\u00a0be mad, but it always makes something in him warm when Aizawa can scold him without letting any rage cloud his actions.\n\u201cPay attention.\u201d Aizawa reminds him. His lips twitch though, face ducking below the scarf he\u2019s wearing, and Shouto feels pleased. He turns back around at the same time Bakugou\u2019s grip grows tighter, the blonde boy growing tense at his side.\n\u201c-months of observing and watching, I have the pleasure of announcing-\u201d Shouto feels himself tense up as well, remembering all those months ago where his name didn\u2019t flash on the screen. He remembers feeling out of place then, two steps behind the rest of his class in yet another thing, alone and separated.\nBakugou also failed though and, surprisingly enough, Shouto would consider the other boy to be his friend now, the both of them bonding over the gruelling classes the course put them through.\n\u201c-That the students who took the extra training courses,\u201d the man continues, eyes glued to the script in front of him. \u201cdue to failing the main exam because of-\u201c\n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d Bakugou snarls, free hand crackling. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just fucking tell us whether we fucking passed or not.\u201d Shouto\u2019s glad the older boy is gripping his right side, not keen on the idea of flammable and explosive sweat being near his fire half.\n\u201c-Have, finally,\u00a0thankfully, passed the course and will receive their provisional licences.\u201d\n\u201cThank fucking christ.\u201d Bakugou shouts, their names appearing on the screen behind the man. People turn to look their way, but Shouto can\u2019t see their expressions because Bakugou is suddenly pulling him into a tight hug. \"We fucking\u00a0did it.\"\nHe\u00a0only has a few\u00a0seconds to think\u00a0what\u00a0before Bakugou is shoving him back with a glare. \u201cThat was for passing,\u201d Bakugou warns, eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t get it in your head that you can latch onto me whenever you feel like it. Also, if Kirishima asks, you grabbed me.\u201d\nShouto feels his lips twitching, relief and something like pride welling up inside him. He\u00a0did\u00a0it.\nHe finally has his provisional licence, has finally caught up to his peers, and can now move onto his future as his own hero. Shouto smiles at Bakugou, unable to help himself, and Bakugou twitches, rolling his eyes at Shouto.\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d The older boy says, unable to help a smile himself. \u201cWe did it, Halfie.\u201d\nShouto twists towards the front of the small room they\u2019re in, spotting his name on a screen again and feeling his grin widen. It\u2019s unfamiliar, this feeling inside him, warm and happy and everything he thought he\u2019d never feel. It\u2019s becoming something he\u2019s more familiar with though, something he\u2019s learning how to cope with.\nHe can hear the rest of his class cheering from where they\u2019re sitting in the small audience \u2013 Kaminari shouting and Ashido whistling, Midoriya\u2019s loud whooping making Eri and Togata laugh \u2013 and Shouto twists to stare at Aizawa, seeking \u2013 something.\nAizawa looks proud. His eyes are shining and there\u2019s a soft, barely there smile on his face. He meets Shouto\u2019s eyes and gives him a nod of approval, of acceptance, and Shouto thinks that even if he had failed again, Aizawa still would have supported him. He\u00a0knows\u00a0Aizawa would of, actually, no traces of doubt in his mind about his teacher and the effort he puts in for all of them.\n\u201cWell done boys.\u201d Toshinori says from besides Aizawa, swinging an arm around the dark haired mans shoulder as he rests a hand over his heart, eyes sparkling like a proud parent. \u201cI knew you could do it \u2013 I always knew, of course. I never had a single doubt when it came to either of you.\u201d\nAizawa rolls his eyes at Shouto, lips twitching again, and he looks over his teachers shoulder to see Midoriya making his way over, eyes bright and pleased, voice ringing loud as he says, \u201cI knew you could both do it!\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya, my boy,\u201d All Might nods his head in agreement. \u201cI was just saying the same thing!\u201d\n\u201cOh wow, really? I suppose great minds think alike.\u201d\nAll Might places a hand on Midoriya's shoulder, the two of them falling into the same stance as they turn their smiles back to Bakugou and him.\n\u201cAll Might\u2019s secret love child.\u201d\u00a0Bakugou\u00a0whispers in his ear and, before Shouto quite knows it, laughter is falling from his mouth.\nBakugou looks proud of himself, sly smile on his face as he looks at Midoriya, and Midoriya looks \u2013\nHis dark hair is curly, some parts covered in pink glitter and matching the glitter Eri and Togata have in theirs, and his face is more freckled due to the sun. His eyes are different shades of green, shining and beautiful, and they\u2019re looking at Shouto in awe, in surprise, soft and warm. His lips are upturned up in what Shouto has dubbed as Midoriya\u2019s\u00a0sunshine smile,\u00a0and it makes him feel he\u2019s done something right, like all the things inside of him could grow into something amazing.\nShouto is overflowing with something bright, something that coats him with warmth, and although he\u2019s not perfect, although he\u2019s still cracked and splintered, he feels better than okay. He feels happy and pleased and \u2013\nShouto feels alive.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nfin\n\n\u00a0"
