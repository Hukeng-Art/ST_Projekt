    "text": "Teachers lie.\u00a0\nIzuku learns this lesson a few weeks into his first year of school. His teacher (well-meaning, but a liar) brings in someone from the school leadership to talk some gooey feel-good words about how bullying won\u2019t be tolerated, and how it\u2019s important to be nice to each other.\nIzuku is nothing but nice to people in his class--and when he  isn\u2019t , it\u2019s an accident and he tries to fix it. He volunteers to pass out whiteboards when it\u2019s time to practice writing (even though Kacchan and his friends always trip him as he walks past), and he even shares his crayons (even though the others always snap them right as they\u2019re handing them back to him, laughing behind their hands as he gets teary-eyed).\u00a0\n\u201cIf you feel like someone\u2019s not treating you nicely, ask them to stop first, and then find a teacher. We\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d his teacher promises the class.\nIzuku feels  everyone\u2019s eyes on him. They\u2019re staring, because they know that Izuku\u2019s the one who got blasted ten yards across the playground yesterday, and who shook and cried even as he got to his feet, only for it to happen a second, third, fourth time (before Kacchan got bored).\u00a0\nBut Izuku is desperate to make just one new friend. He thinks (misguidedly) that maybe if a teacher reminds everyone to just be  nice to him, maybe someone will finally sit with Izuku at lunch.\nIzuku goes up to his teacher after class has let out and tugs on her sleeve and says, \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d\nShe puts her hands on her knees and leans down to be eye-level with Izuku. \u201cWhat is it, Midoriya?\u201d\nHe whispers, \u201cSometimes the other kids aren\u2019t...nice to me.\u201d\nShe watches him, and Izuku watches her face meld into concern. (He realizes, even at six years old, that it doesn\u2019t look exactly real.) \u201cLike who? Can you give me an example?\u201d\nIzuku grips the straps of his backpack and ducks his head to the floor. His voice is so quiet that she chides him to speak up and repeat himself, but the second attempt is still almost inaudible. \u201cUm, like Kacchan. Sometimes. Yesterday he kept using his quirk on me and he does it to some of the other kids too.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ask him to stop?\u201d she asks.\nIzuku frowns, but he doesn\u2019t dare look up at her. \u201cYes. He never listens.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him about it tomorrow,\u201d she says. (Lie.) \u201cHis quirk is so powerful, it might be an accident that he uses it, so maybe we could try to be a little more patient with him. He can\u2019t control it very well.\u201d (Lie.) \u201cI appreciate you speaking up, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be a problem for much longer.\u201d (Lie.)\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku says, because he doesn\u2019t recognize those lies yet. He has an idea that things aren\u2019t going to go exactly  well , but he believes to some extent that his teacher\u2019s just somehow missed the teasing that Izuku is the target of. He believes that she has some power to do something about this.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d she says. Smiles.\n\u201cSee you,\u201d Izuku says, and then weaves through the school to take the back exit in hopes of avoiding Kacchan on the way home. (He isn\u2019t successful.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day at recess, Kacchan towers over Izuku and corners him against the wall of the school. Kacchan says, with explosions popping out of his hands, \u201cI heard you  tattled. What did you think was gonna happen? Even the teachers know you\u2019re useless. They agree with me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku insists, too late. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cTeacher called my mom,\u201d Kacchan says. He sneers, and blasts Izuku backwards. \u201cYou can\u2019t even  lie good.\u201d\nIzuku knows that this is all in plain sight of the classroom window. He turns his head, trying to seek out his teacher, hoping that she\u2019s seen something.\u00a0\nHe makes eye contact with her. And then she looks away, pretending like she\u2019d never seen him at all as she returns to her computer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTeachers don\u2019t believe him.\nIn fourth grade Izuku turns in a short project about what he wants to do when he grows up, and his teacher looks at the title of the paper and the corners of his mouth visibly turn up in an incredulous smile. \u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says, \u201cI asked for you to put real thought into this.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Izuku insists, his heart sinking. He looks at the project, which is a paper combined with a small collage of photos and drawings and newspaper clippings, which he\u2019d poured his heart and soul into for two weeks.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a good grade if you aren\u2019t going to take this seriously,\u201d his teacher says. He hasn\u2019t even  looked at the plan Izuku had laid out for becoming a hero even without a quirk--it\u2019s like the teacher doesn\u2019t care at all. \u201cIt just seems like you think this is a joke.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s vision is getting watery. The teacher might as well be holding Izuku\u2019s entire heart in his hands, considering the effort that Izuku had put in to making his life plan plausible to an outside observer. \u201cSensei, I promise I don\u2019t! I t-tried my best and--\u201d\n\u201cDeku\u2019s crying again,\u201d says a classmate, and everyone turns to look at him. The first classmate laughs, harsh and loud--and almost everyone joins her.\nIzuku sees Kacchan zero in on the assignment that Izuku had just handed in. \u201cDeku, are you still trying to say you\u2019re going to be a  hero when you grow up?\u201d\n\u201cI--\u201d Izuku blinks rapidly, and tries to sit up straighter to stand up to him. \u201cI  am gonna be a hero.\u201d\nHis classmates only laugh louder at him. Izuku looks to his teacher, pleading, but his teacher looks like he\u2019s on the verge of laughter too.\n\u201cMidoriya, it doesn\u2019t hurt to be realistic,\u201d is all his teacher says. Izuku stares at his desk and watches tears\u00a0splash onto it.\n\u00a0\nTeachers don\u2019t like Izuku.\nHe realizes this in middle school (maybe a little late on that realization, but Izuku had held onto optimism of being proved wrong for a bit too long). He doesn\u2019t know what else he can do to redeem himself for his quirklessness. He does every assignment on time and he does extra credit and he raises his hand in class (he raises his hand in class until he gets too much attention from his classmates and the teacher starts glaring at him whenever he wants to speak up).\u00a0\nThey  hate him, as a rule. Parent-teacher conferences prove this, year after year, and finally in middle school, Izuku stops pretending to himself that it\u2019s ever going to get better.\nThat year, a teacher says, \u201cHe just gets in too many fights, Mrs. Midoriya. I\u2019ve never had a student who provokes others so easily. Midoriya is a real problem child in our classroom.\u201d\nAnother says, \u201cHis  incessant mumbling is a distraction to the other students. It\u2019s unfair to the others that he cannot seem to keep his mouth shut.\u201d\nYet another says, \u201cHe would get along better with his peers if he could get his head out of the clouds for just one day. It just seems as if he doesn\u2019t care enough to pay attention to the reality of his situation.\u201d\nIzuku watches the floor, and tries not to cry as his mother keeps shooting him confused glances.\u00a0\nOn the way home, he doesn\u2019t talk much. Inko tries to get him to explain himself, to help her understand why the picture the teachers have painted is so different from what she\u2019s seen of him. Izuku has become quieter the past few years; he doesn\u2019t tell  anyone what he goes through on a day-to-day basis (no one would do anything about it anyway), so he supposes he can\u2019t be upset with his mom for not defending him better against the teachers.\n\u201cYou have got to stop fighting, Izuku,\u201d Inko finally says.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku says, tired, forehead pressed to the window. His stomach hurts. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nThe car is silent after that.\n\u00a0\nSo, basically, teachers\u00a0and Izuku don't mix.\u00a0\nUpon starting at UA, Izuku had come armed with his knowledge of school--ready for anything. And UA is so much  better  than school has ever been before. He has friends, now, for one. Izuku has people to sit with at lunch, and a buffer of two or three people whenever Kacchan walks by, and\u00a0people\u00a0listen\u00a0when Izuku goes off on fifteen-minute tangents (even if they're about something stupid).\nWhen he\u2019s walking through the halls, he isn\u2019t scared (usually) that someone\u2019s going to shove him down, and he isn\u2019t scared (usually) that someone\u2019s going to throw his backpack into the mud, and he isn\u2019t scared (usually) that Kacchan\u2019s going to saut\u00e9 him like an onion at any given moment.\nBut Izuku still doesn\u2019t trust teachers as far as he can spit. (Even All Might, who  seems  to like Izuku, is probably still capable of laughing in Izuku\u2019s face if Izuku ever tried to tell him about the years of torment he experienced at the hands of his classmates. Teachers just don\u2019t do anything about that sort of thing.)\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Midnight pinches his cheek when he pulls off a good art portfolio first semester, telling him she\u2019s proud of his work (she wouldn\u2019t knock Kacchan out if he leaped at Izuku in the middle of the hallway). It doesn\u2019t matter that Present Mic doesn\u2019t shut Izuku up when Izuku gets carried away asking about Present Mic\u2019s quirk after class (Present Mic will turn on him in a second if Izuku starts mumbling in class too much). Teachers at UA are better about at least  pretending to care, but Izuku doesn\u2019t trust them. He can\u2019t.\nThe teacher who gets the brunt of Izuku\u2019s distrust is Aizawa, if only because he\u2019s the one they spend the most time with.\nAizawa doesn\u2019t dole out much praise to anyone. But nobody else in the class gets glared at as much as Izuku, he\u2019s pretty sure. And nobody else in the class gets the nickname  problem child, and Izuku is painfully aware of this.\nIzuku is good at internalizing. He\u2019s been dealing with it for a long time, after all. He can almost pretend that an annoyed glance from Aizawa doesn\u2019t hurt Izuku any worse than the broken finger he\u2019s statistically likely to be sporting.\n\u00a0\nThe distrust carries deep into his first year.\u00a0\n'Distrust' is a bit harsh, really. Izuku has seen the way that Aizawa had leaped into battle for them and gotten his face smashed in just to protect Tsuyu at USJ. As far as Izuku\u2019s aware, Aizawa has always answered his phone when someone in the class has needed him--even when it was just an anxious Koda trying to prep for the sports festival.\nSo, it\u2019s not exactly  distrust. Izuku can\u2019t think of the right word.\u00a0\nEither way, there\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s shaking right now, standing in front of Aizawa.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to explain yourself?\u201d Aizawa asks, his voice quiet, dangerous. It\u2019s just him and Izuku in the classroom--the other kid is long gone. \u201cI just want to understand.\u201d\n(Teachers lie.)\nIzuku doesn\u2019t say a word.\n\u201cYou know that it\u2019s unacceptable to fight your fellow students,\u201d Aizawa says, \u201cso I figure that you have a reason to explain your actions.\u201d\n(Teachers don\u2019t believe him.)\nIzuku wipes at his bloody nose with the back of his ruined sleeve. There\u2019s already a small puddle of blood on the classroom floor.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a problem kid, but usually not without reason,\u201d Aizawa says. It seems like a ploy, to make Izuku feel like Aizawa cares about him specifically.\u00a0\n(Teachers don\u2019t like him.)\n\u201cMidoriya, tell me what happened.\u201d Aizawa isn\u2019t asking, anymore. He\u2019s commanding.\u00a0\n\u201cHe was--the upperclassman was pushing him around,\u201d Izuku says to the spatter of blood on the tiles. \u201cNobody else was going to do anything.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t need to look up to know that Aizawa\u2019s lip is curling in displeasure. \u201cAny teacher would have intervened on your behalf.\u201d\n(Teachers don\u2019t intervene.)\n\u201cI was the only one there.\u201d Izuku hunches his shoulders. \u201cIs he going to get in trouble?\u201d\n\u201cThe upperclassman? Yes, there will be--\u201d\n\u201cNo, the--the kid from the business course.\u201d\u00a0\nAizawa pauses at that, like he hadn\u2019t thought Izuku would care about that kid (as if Izuku hadn\u2019t  been that kid for most of his life). He says a slow, confused, \u201cNo.\u201d\nIzuku lets out a relieved breath. He wipes his nose again. He\u2019s going to have to look out for the business course kid again, because Izuku\u2019s pretty sure this isn\u2019t the first occurrence, but that\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s just Izuku and the upperclassman in trouble, Izuku can deal with that.\n\u201cGo see Recovery Girl,\u201d Aizawa finally sighs, when it\u2019s clear that Izuku won\u2019t be offering any more explanation. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let this happen again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s kind of harsh, but Izuku\u2019s the only student who seems to know the truth of the situation. He watches Tsuyu say confidently that  Aizawa  can help. He watches Yaoyorozu casually express her confidence that  Aizawa will know what to do.\u00a0\n(Maybe that\u2019s true, for students who are likeable and good. Izuku is neither of these things.)\nThere are a lot of things that Izuku would bring to Aizawa\u2019s attention, if he knew Aizawa would do something about it. Izuku would tell him that the upperclassman he\u2019d gotten into a fight with still picks on non-hero-course first-years sometimes. He would tell Aizawa that sometimes Uraraka comes to school so hungry that she\u2019s nauseous even  before they start training.\u00a0\nIf he knew Aizawa would do something, he would tell Aizawa that Endeavor is the biggest piece of shit alive.\nBut Aizawa  wouldn\u2019t do anything, especially against the Number Two Hero, if Izuku was the one who told him. It hurts, but that\u2019s just the reality--and Izuku doesn\u2019t want to see Todoroki hurt like that, for Todoroki to have his fledgling trust crushed like that. So nobody says anything about the issue at all.\n\u201cAizawa won\u2019t do anything,\u201d Izuku says. His hand skates over the gauze wrapped around Todoroki\u2019s forearm, which will be hidden by Todoroki\u2019s jacket, but the nasty burn on Todoroki\u2019s neck is going to be harder to hide.\u00a0\nTodoroki looks like he wants to trust Izuku. \u201cYou think?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku nods. He swallows the lump in his throat. \u201cTeachers turn a blind eye to this kind of thing, usually. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki says. He pulls his coat back on. Even though he hasn\u2019t seemed exactly  nervous  thus far, because Todoroki doesn\u2019t do that, there\u2019s something more relaxed about him now. (Izuku wishes he could be similarly reassured. He hates seeing Todoroki show up to school like this.)\u00a0\nIzuku walks with Todoroki to class. They sit and chat with friends and nobody notices Todoroki\u2019s haggard appearance (or maybe they just don\u2019t want to say anything).\nWhen Aizawa asks Todoroki to stay and talk to him after class for a moment, Izuku  knows he sees the burn on Todoroki\u2019s neck. Trying to keep one ear on the conversation going on, Izuku packs his things up very slowly.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something you need to talk to me about,\u201d Aizawa says pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m always here to listen.\u201d\n(Teachers lie.)\n\u201cThis was a training accident. My fault,\u201d Todoroki says, his voice betraying nothing. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cRecovery Girl may have some salve for it, anyway. I\u2019ll write you a note.\u201d\n\u201cI already put something on it,\u201d Todoroki says. Izuku sees him look wistfully at the door, as if he wants to be anywhere else. \u201cThank you for your concern.\u201d\nTodoroki is dismissed, and Izuku tries to take off after him, but Aizawa puts out an arm to stop Izuku in his tracks.\u00a0\n\u201cIf there was something going on,\u201d Aizawa says, in a lower voice, \u201cyou would tell me?\u201d\n(Teachers don\u2019t believe him.)\nIzuku wants to tell Aizawa. He\u2019s been told  many times that it\u2019s important to tell an adult if someone\u2019s in danger--but it never does any good for Izuku, or for anyone that Izuku drags down with him.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d he lies. \u201cOf course!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku isn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019s been followed, but he\u2019s two blocks from UA one morning when he happens to glance over his shoulder and sees someone\u00a0pursuing him. It\u2019s definitely the same person that\u2019d sat across from Izuku on the train, because he\u2019s wearing a weirdly light jacket for this time of year, and he\u2019s staring right at Izuku.\nIzuku holds eye contact a little while too long to be casual. When he turns to hurry on his way to school, he hears footsteps pick up behind him, feels the person tailing him closely enough to almost step on Izuku\u2019s heels.\nIt\u2019s a crowded street. Izuku, in his UA uniform, isn\u2019t going to get attacked in the middle of this crowd. (Is he?)\nHow long has someone been following him? Izuku\u2019s been so wrapped up in daydreams about his upcoming internship that he hadn\u2019t been paying attention at all. Does he know where Izuku lives? Is he targeting Izuku specifically?\nIzuku makes it into the gates of the school without getting murdered. His pursuer blends into the customary mob of reporters in front of the gate, and Izuku can\u2019t see him when he looks over his shoulder.\n\u00a0\nIzuku is followed again the next day. He knows this, because he\u2019s late and has to take a later train, and the man\u2019s waiting for him at the train station. He sits across from Izuku and stares at him the whole ride, and Izuku squirms and keeps his eyes trained on his phone and desperately tries to think of what to do.\nWhat would he do if someone else was being followed? Izuku knows that if  Uraraka was the one being tailed to school, he\u2019d insist on getting a group to walk with her, or he\u2019d tell her to tell a teacher, or he\u2019d go to the police.\u00a0\n(Teachers don\u2019t believe him.)\nIzuku doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if he told Aizawa, only to have Aizawa tell him he was saying it for attention--only to have Aizawa look at him with contempt and tell Izuku to stop daydreaming and focus on internship prep.\u00a0\nThe train begins to slow to a stop. Izuku\u2019s thumb hovers over Aizawa\u2019s contact information in his phone, because he  should tell Aizawa. He should at least let Aizawa know that Izuku is going to be late for first period.\nThe man following Izuku puts a hand on Izuku\u2019s shoulder as they leave the train station, and Izuku jumps. He clicks his phone off and braces for what\u2019s to come.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, right?\u201d the man asks. \u201cI\u2019m  such a fan. Could you give me your autograph?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s being steered towards an alleyway. He squeaks, \u201cUh, sure?\u201d even as he digs in his heels and tries to stay out on the street.\u00a0\nThe man wraps his arm tighter around Izuku\u2019s shoulders, and laughs like he and Izuku are good friends. That\u2019s why nobody even glances at them as Izuku\u2019s pushed into the alley, and out of sight of passerby.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d the man says, smiling widely. He pulls a photo out of his pocket, and shoves it in Izuku\u2019s direction. \u201cCould you sign that? I really just need your name.\u201d\nSomething about the phrasing makes Izuku uncomfortable. It\u2019s why Izuku breaks the man\u2019s hold around his shoulders, and stutter-steps backwards, and says, \u201cActually, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m--late for s-school and I should--\u201d\n\u201cJust a quick signature,\u201d the man insists, and then slams a hand into the wall so that Izuku\u2019s boxed in, his exit blocked. \u201cFor my kids.\u201d\nIzuku takes the photo, hands shaky, and the man\u2019s newly-free hand goes to a  knife at his side.\n\u201cWho do I make it out to?\u201d Izuku asks, his voice almost inaudible because he can\u2019t breathe. He wonders if he\u2019d get yelled at if he broke just one of his fingers to escape this situation. (He probably would.)\nHis phone buzzes a few times in his pocket, incoming texts that are most likely from Kirishima or Uraraka. (He\u2019s officially late for homeroom.)\n\u201cJust your name is fine,\u201d the man says. He leans closer, crowding Izuku against the wall even further. His hand closes around the handle of his knife. \u201cWrite it already.\u201d\nLooking closer, the photo isn\u2019t even of Izuku at the sports festival. It\u2019s a shot taken of Izuku boarding the bus with a few of his classmates, taken from a distance.\u00a0\n(Izuku hasn\u2019t taken the bus for a few weeks. This photo is from before the sports festival.)\nIzuku\u2019s  scared. That\u2019s why, when the man makes a sudden move (maybe just shifting his balance, maybe just adjusting his angle), Izuku flinches and flicks his finger and blasts the guy across the alley into the opposing wall.\u00a0\nThe man hits the wall, slides to the ground, and snarls, \u201cYou  shit,\u201d as he scrambles back to his feet. Izuku, reeling from the pain in his hand, bolts, but is caught around the waist and hauled backwards, thrown bodily into some trash cans.\u00a0\n\u201cJust fucking  write your name,\u201d the man snarls, \u201cthat\u2019s  all you had to do.\u201d\nIzuku rolls, gets to his feet, sheds his backpack. The man is standing in front of his only exit, now brandishing his knife and approaching again.\u00a0\nIzuku shoves the photo into his pocket. (If anything, it\u2019ll give him evidence that he\u2019s not lying when he inevitably has to tell someone about about this encounter.) \u201cExcuse me, I need to g-get to class,\u201d Izuku says.\u00a0\nThe man swipes with his knife, and Izuku leaps backwards. The man swipes  again, and Izuku trips over a fallen trashcan and slams into the ground elbows-first and swallows his cry of pain as he stares up at his attacker, can only stare as the man swipes a third time and carves a sharp line across Izuku\u2019s chest before Izuku can recover or block.  Stupid, to get tripped like this, but Izuku can\u2019t focus on that  .\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s just a graze. It means that the man is close. Izuku kicks out and channels his quirk through the top of his foot and sends the man flying sky-high.\u00a0\nIzuku clenches his teeth around a scream as his foot and shin both fracture in a few places, but he doesn\u2019t have time to wallow. He staggers to his feet and runs for the end of the alley.\nThere\u2019s a massive  thump  behind him as the man hits the ground, and a  crack as a few of his ribs break on impact.\nIzuku stumbles out of the alley into the way of pedestrians, and hears a shocked scream. He grabs the first person he can reach, and asks, \u201cCould you call the police?\u201d\nThe woman stares at him.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be worried, I\u2019m fine! I just need to make a report,\u201d Izuku asks. He\u2019s feeling dizzy, and his leg is threatening to give out. \u201cI need\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKid, you\u2019re  bleeding!\u201d she exclaims, her face pale. People are beginning to gather, chattering anxiously. \u201cSit down!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Izuku insists. Smiles. \u201cBut please, could you call the police?\u201d\nShe pulls her phone out, but she\u2019s still staring at him in horror. Before he can reassure her again, Izuku\u2019s knee buckles, and he hits the pavement hard. He\u2019s out cold before anyone can do anything else to help him.\n\u00a0\nIzuku...loves morphine.\nIt\u2019s not often that he\u2019s given it, because if he uses it every time he\u2019s in pain then he\u2019ll develop a dangerous tolerance before even graduating, but Izuku wakes up from a deep, comfortable sleep and blinks groggy eyes at the blank ceiling of the medical wing and feels painkillers making his whole body feel fluid and heavy and warm. He has to admit that it\u2019s preferable to feeling...whatever injury he\u2019s sustained this time.\nWhy is he here again?\nHe turns his head, and sees Aizawa sitting there. Izuku starts, sitting up fast enough that his head swims and he thinks he\u2019s going to throw up.\nAizawa doesn\u2019t lecture him right away. He\u2019s almost somber. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks Izuku quietly.\u00a0\nIzuku wonders what day it is. He wonders where All Might is. He wonders where  Recovery Girl  is, because it\u2019s just Izuku and Aizawa; the rest of the room is silent and sterile and empty.\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d he tells Aizawa, then looks down to his lap. His broken finger is splinted, and down at the end of the bed, he sees that his foot is encased in a boot. When Aizawa doesn\u2019t say anything else, Izuku dares to ask, \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d\nAizawa huffs a laugh, almost inaudible. It\u2019s more of a sharp exhale than anything else. \u201cHow about you tell me what happened, and then we\u2019ll decide.\u201d\nIzuku takes a deep breath. His chest aches, and he finally processes that the mass of white on his chest isn\u2019t a shirt--he\u2019s wrapped very thoroughly in bandages, with some rust-colored stains beginning to soak through. It appears that he\u2019d been more-than-grazed by that knife attack.\nThat\u2019s probably why he\u2019s at the school medical wing and not in an actual hospital. It means it was such an emergency that they\u2019d called the closest medical professional they could find.\nHe hopes someone told his mom.\n\u201cHe--he\u2019s been following me,\u201d Izuku says. He clenches his uninjured fist, trying to keep himself grounded. \u201cToday\u2019s just the day he decided to escalate.\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Aizawa asks.\n\u201cJust a couple days!\u201d Izuku reassures, but he winces as he remembers, \u201cWell, actually it turns out, for a couple weeks? But I didn\u2019t notice him until...what day is it?\u201d\n\u201cThursday morning,\u201d Aizawa says.\n\u201cUm, I didn\u2019t realize until...three days ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think it was important to mention to anyone?\u201d Aizawa asks, incredulous.\u00a0\n(Teachers don\u2019t believe him.)\n\u201cI promise I\u2019m not making this up!\u201d Izuku insists, tears clouding his vision. He twists, trying to find where his jacket\u2019s gone, but his torso explodes in pain and he doubles over, gasping. Aizawa sits up, leans forward to pat his back with surprising gentleness, while Izuku breathes out, \u201cI\u2019m not--lying, I  promise, there\u2019s a photo he gave me that\u2019s in my jacket--\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Aizawa tells him.\u00a0\n(Teachers lie.)\n\u00a0Izuku gets over his brief flash of pain, and sinks back under the soft waves of his painkillers. \u201cHe---he tried to get me to give him an autograph. But I\u2019m pretty sure he has some kind of quirk that would use my autograph to do--something, so I didn\u2019t want to give it to him? But then I wasn\u2019t sure if I was being  paranoid, and when I tried to leave he--he attacked me and I\u00a0promise  I wasn\u2019t trying to fight him.\u201d\n\u201cBreathe, kid.\u201d Aizawa doesn\u2019t remove his hand from Izuku\u2019s back. \u201cWhat photo did he give you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my jacket,\u201d Izuku says again, gesturing uselessly because he has no idea where his clothes have gone. He\u2019s just shivering in a thin hospital gown right now.\nAizawa stands, knees popping, and he crosses the room to a pile of discarded, bloodstained clothing that vaguely resembles Izuku\u2019s uniform. Aizawa picks through the clothes until he unearths the jacket, and then he pulls the crumpled photograph out and examines it.\n\u201cWhen was this taken?\u201d Aizawa asks, even more seriously than he\u2019d sounded before.\n\u201cI think--a couple weeks ago?\u201d Izuku says. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t really follow me closely until a few days ago. That\u2019s when I noticed him.\u201d\n\u201cYou noticed him  before the day he attacked you?\u201d Aizawa asks, and slowly turns to face Izuku again.\nIzuku, terrified, nods.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll ask  again, why didn\u2019t you say a  thing to anyone?\u201d\u00a0\n(Teachers don\u2019t intervene.)\nIzuku...hates morphine. Because while sober Izuku would die before blurting out an answer to that question,  high Izuku has no problem saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would change anything.\u201d\n\u201cSorry?\u201d Aizawa says, deadly still.\nIzuku\u2019s face flushes red. His heart skips a beat in his panic. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would do anything! It\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault--it\u2019s  my fault--but I figured I\u2019d just deal with it on my own and it\u2019d be fine!\u201d\n\u201cYou--?\u201d Aizawa says, torn between angry and baffled. \u201cYou thought that you\u2019d be ignored if you told a teacher that your life was in danger?\u201d\nIzuku squints, not sure if the question is rhetorical. \u201c...Yes?\u201d\nAizawa stares.\nIzuku feels the fatal urge to explain himself, and he\u2019s too woozy to stop the words coming out of his mouth. \u201cNobody would have believed me anyway. I know you don\u2019t like me already because I\u2019m the problem kid and I figured I could just deal with it by myself.\u201d\nAizawa doesn\u2019t respond to that. He looks like someone\u2019s just tipped him over the edge of a tall cliff and the horror hasn\u2019t set in yet--he\u2019s still working through shock.\u00a0\nRecovery Girl enters the room then, armed with candies that she shoves at both Izuku and Aizawa. If she notices the tense atmosphere in the room, she ignores it. \u201cYou\u2019re awake! Eraserhead, get out of the way so I can check some vitals.\u201d\nAizawa moves out of the way without protest. When Izuku glances after him again a few minutes later, Aizawa is gone.\n\u00a0\nStudents lie.\nAizawa has had so many students lie to his face  this year alone  that he\u2019s about to institute a Lie Jar so that he can make some pocket change whenever a kid looks him dead in the eye and spits a falsehood his way. They lie about why their homework isn\u2019t done, they lie about why their friends are absent from class, they lie about where they got the sickening bruises that clearly aren\u2019t the result of school-sponsored combat training.\nAizawa understands. He understands better than his students give him credit for. He\u2019d been in their place about fifteen years ago (HAS IT REALLY BEEN THAT LONG, says the shrill voice of his husband in his head), and Aizawa\u2019s aware of the fact that he lied to  his teachers, too. It\u2019s a time-honored UA tradition.\u00a0\nPlus Ultra.\nThere are distinct memories in his head of him staring at the ground and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d to a teacher\u2019s concerned question about his sleeping habits. Or of him mumbling, \u201cI just forgot,\u201d when Recovery Girl asked exactly  why  he hasn\u2019t eaten in a few days. Or of him saying, \u201cI sparred with a friend after school yesterday,\u201d when another teacher asked where the hell he\u2019d gotten so beat up.\u00a0\nSo of course Aizawa knows that Kirishima\u2019s dozing off in class for a reason (even though Kirishima\u2019s quick to tell him that he keeps accidentally playing video games too late, sorry!). Aizawa knows that Uraraka\u2019s getting more nauseous and faint in class lately for a reason (even though Uraraka chirps that she\u2019s just so forgetful about breakfast, it won\u2019t happen again).\u00a0\nAizawa knows that Todoroki shows up to class favoring his ribs and startling at the slightest contact for a  reason  (even though Todoroki says it was a  training accident, my fault).\u00a0\nStudents lie.\u00a0\nAizawa doesn\u2019t want to call them out on this directly. But, he\u2019s careful to mentally note when students lie, and how often, and why, and for who.\u00a0\nWhich is why he\u2019s blindsided by the truth when Midoriya, fresh out of a villain attack, says plainly,  \u201cI know you don\u2019t like me already. I\u2019m the problem kid and I figured I could just deal with it by myself.\u201d \nAizawa\u2019s been shooed out of the room before he can even  begin to think of a response to that. He slumps against the wall outside Recovery Girl\u2019s medical wing and squints at the floor for twenty minutes before he realizes he\u2019s neglected his duty as a teacher, which is to be honest with his students.\u00a0\nThis is a deep-seated issue with Midoriya, it appears. A big enough problem that Midoriya, as a first-year student, didn\u2019t tell a soul that someone had targeted him. And yet Aizawa hadn\u2019t even noticed until his student had almost been murdered in cold blood.\n\u201cYou can come back in,\u201d Recovery Girl says, poking her head out into the hallway. \u201cYou have some explaining to do, mister.\u201d\nAizawa gets up without protest, and shuffles into the ward, and drops back into the seat next to Midoriya\u2019s bed.\u00a0\nMidoriya isn\u2019t asleep. He\u2019s curled up on his side, but his eyes are open and glassy and he\u2019s watching Aizawa closely. (Tracking Aizawa\u2019s facial expressions carefully, Aizawa realizes. Aizawa\u2019s never been great at having the correct facial expressions but he\u2019s going to try anyway for this kid.)\n\u201cTell me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Aizawa says, \u201cbut it seems that you\u2019ve had teachers in the past abuse your trust.\u201d\nMidoriya, thankfully, doesn\u2019t start crying again. But the defeated laugh that he gives instead isn\u2019t much better. \u201cI guess.\u201d\n\u201cIs there something there that you want to talk about?\u201d Aizawa asks.\u00a0\nMidoriya blinks. The glazed-over, detached look in his eyes doesn\u2019t dissipate--it seems to get worse. Maybe a new dose of pain meds is kicking in. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s kind of stupid and I don\u2019t want you to have to listen to all that.\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa says firmly (Midoriya tenses up, but Aizawa ignores this for  both their sakes). \u201cI\u2019m asking because I care.\u201d\nMidoriya  almost  rolls his eyes--Aizawa can see it. Aizawa sees it, and recognizes it as Midoriya saying,  you\u2019re lying.  (He\u2019s seen this exact expression on Midoriya before, and he  shouldn\u2019t have dismissed it the first time.)\n\u201cI care,\u201d Aizawa says again. \u201cYou\u2019re a diligent student, and you\u2019ve never given me reason not to enjoy having you in class. Do you understand?\u201d\nMidoriya mumbles something like,  problem child.\u00a0\nAizawa takes a measured breath, and then exhales slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that that nickname affected you so strongly. I didn\u2019t mean any harm by it, but I apologize anyway. Do you think you\u2019re the only student who causes me premature greying?\u201d\nMidoriya squints.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d Aizawa answers for him. \u201cI need you to tell me when you\u2019re in danger. Understand?\u201d\nMidoriya says, sleepy, \u201cTeachers don\u2019t care when I\u2019m in danger.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I  do. Don\u2019t make generalizations like that,\u201d Aizawa says. He slowly reaches out and ruffles Midoriya\u2019s wild hair, and he\u2019s quietly pleased when Midoriya doesn\u2019t shrink away from him, instead cracks into the beginnings of a smile. It\u2019s only the first step on a long road, but it\u2019s a start. \u201cDo you want company until your classmates get here?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Midoriya mumbles, face shuttering again.\n(Students lie.)\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask again,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cWant me to stay?\u201d\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Midoriya says, just hopeful enough to hit Aizawa right where he\u2019s soft. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d"
