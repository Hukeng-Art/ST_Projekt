    "text": "Thor could feel nothing but rage as he fell. His father had cast him out for doing exactly as he had done! He was only trying to follow in his father\u2019s foot steps! After all, the Frost Giants were war hungry. They had attempted to steal from Asgard and they would pay for their treachery!\u00a0\nHe felt the moment his trajectory changed - the sharp turn as he was pulled away from the expected path and in another direction. His whole body jolted and he cried out in outrage as a force beyond his will decided his path for him. Just another thing he could blame the Allfather for.\u00a0\nHe landed hard, body weaker than it had ever been - and he struggled to his feet, rage burning through him once more. He looked around at his surroundings, even angrier than before. He was in a dark forest, the sky invisible above him - blocked out by dark and looming boughs.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d he demanded, even as the chill began to seep under his skin. He knew the feeling of danger even if he\u2019d never felt real fear before. The sound of a twig breaking behind him had him spinning around, ready to shout and curse at whoever was sneaking up behind him, but then the scar on his chest began to glow the colour of a flame and words failed him as he came face to face with bright green eyes peering out of the darkness. A darkness that was being pushed back by a matching fire glow, revealing the young face of a boy, watching him curiously.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry woke up, the scar on his chest itching. He knew it was his soulmark, but he\u2019d never felt anything from it before - to the point where he often forgot it was there. He knew everyone had one - but it wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d been brought into the magical world that he really understood what they were.\u00a0\nThey were called splitting scars, and they were said to be the mark left behind when one soul had been ripped in two, the sign of soulmates. That when the other half of your soul was near, both scars would glow, a sign that the two halves were reuniting.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d never really had cause to believe those words before. Not that he doubted, per say, but he\u2019d never really seen it, and his own scar had always just been that - a scar.\u00a0\nBut not anymore.\u00a0\nNow it itched, like something was trying to scratch its way from under his skin, and there was something akin to the prickle of anticipating making itself known.\u00a0\nCarefully, he slid out of bed, putting his shoes on. He hesitated a moment before reaching for his invisibility cloak. Even as he clasped it around his neck, he revelled in the fact that it had been his father\u2019s. He\u2019d only had it for a month, but it was his most prized possession and he hugged it close as if by doing so its last owner would feel his affection. Cautious, he pulled the hood over his head, slipping from his dormitory. He knew the other first years wouldn\u2019t wake - they all slept like the dead - but he was more worried about the fat lady in the portrait giving him away. He may be invisible, but portraits never opened for no reason.\u00a0\nHe was in luck because the fat lady was fast asleep when he slipped from the common room and stood at the top of the staircase, hesitant once more.\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t really sure where he was going or just why he felt so strongly about following the urge, but then it was like his scar tugged on his chest and he followed the feeling. He followed it down the stairs and out the doors onto the school grounds. He followed it all the way past Hagrid\u2019s hut, hesitating only briefly on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. After all, he\u2019d already been beneath its boughs and the experience had been less than pleasant.\u00a0\nHarry shook the thought off, the pull in his chest more insistent now. He followed it into the forest, weaving his way over roots and around bushes, very aware of the sounds of the forests residents as they moved around him. A shiver crawled its way up his spine but he ignored it, pushing forward.\u00a0\nA bright flash of light shone up ahead followed by a resounding bang of something landing hard on the ground. Harry knew without a doubt that whatever was pulling him forward, was what had just landed. He hurried forward, not noticing when the hood slipped from his head in his haste. He heard a man\u2019s voice shout up ahead - not quite catching the words - but then he saw him and he couldn\u2019t help but shrink back at the sight at first. The man was huge; tall, and broad, with muscles that made everyone he knew look weak and scrawny. He had golden hair to his shoulders, and when he spun around, bright, electric blue eyes fell on him. The moment they did, a light flared on the man\u2019s chest, through the shirt he wore, the colour of fire. He jolted in surprise when those eyes met his, and then he felt a flare of magic from his own chest. He pushed his cloak aside and watched in awe as a light the same bright colour glowed from his own chest.\u00a0\n\u201cWell met, little one.\u201d and the anger he\u2019d heard in the man\u2019s tone earlier was gone. Harry\u2019s head snapped up to look at him, but he had his hands up in a show of peace, lowering his stance so he no longer appeared quite so big.\u00a0\n\u201cEr, hello.\u201d Harry greeted in return, unsure. He\u2019d never seen anyone meet their soulmate before, he had no idea how this was supposed to go. He also hadn\u2019t heard of anyone else meeting their soulmate when they were only 11. He knew it was probably something else people would find unusual about him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cUm, Harry, Harry Potter.\u201d he offered. It couldn\u2019t be wrong to tell his soulmate who he was, could it? And after all, most people knew who he was without introduction anyways. He mustered up all the courage he had. \u201cWho - uh - who are you?\u201d\n\u201cI am Thor Odinson, prince of Asgard.\u201d Harry blinked. A prince?\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Asgard?\u201d he found himself asking, despite himself, and Thor offered him a bright smile.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is one of the nine realms of Yggdrasill. The world tree.\u201d Harry nodded. It sounded vaguely familiar, but he was fairly certain he\u2019d heard it from a myth. He wondered if the magical world felt differently about it.\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Um. That\u2019s cool.\u201d he replied, feeling awkward. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the prince, what are you doing here?\u201d that rage came flooding back, but it wasn\u2019t aimed at him. That was the only thing that didn\u2019t have him scuttling back.\u00a0\n\u201cFather banished me to this realm as punishment.\u201d he scowled, glaring up at the sky. \u201cHe banished me for wanting to punish those that would steal from us. My father once declared war on their people and made them bow before him. Now they would spit in the face of his mercy and steal from our kingdom.\u201d Harry frowned. He didn\u2019t really understand.\u00a0\n\u201cBut - what were they trying to steal?\u201d\n\u201cA cask. One my father claimed as reparations for the damage done during the war.\u201d\n\u201cSo, it was theirs?\u201d Thor scowled.\u00a0\n\u201cOnce, but-\u201d\n\u201cSo they were taking back something that already belonged to them.\u201d Thor\u2019s scowl darkened.\u00a0\n\u201cThey would have if we had not stopped them.\u201d\n\u201cSo, really your father stole it. They just wanted back something that already belonged to them.\u201d Thor didn\u2019t respond right away. In the glow from his soulmark, he looked particular dangerous.\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d because the boy\u2019s words were true despite his feelings on the matter.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you want to kill them for that?\u201d the boy looked nearly heartbroken by the thought. It hit him like a physical blow. That he would be the one to put such a look of sadness on his soulmates expression made him realize that perhaps his father might\u2019ve been right to cast him out.\u00a0\n\u201cThere was a time when they killed many of my people.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut so did you,\u201d Harry countered, unsure when he\u2019d decided he could speak his mind without fear, but he couldn\u2019t seem to help himself. \u201cIt was war, right? People die in war.\u201d Thor wondered what sort of pain this youth had experienced to have such ghosts lingering in his gaze. It seemed he didn\u2019t have to ask because the boy, Harry, volunteered the information.\u00a0\n\u201cMy parents were killed by someone who wanted to rule over everyone. He thought he was better than everyone else too. He thought that because of where his blood came from he was better than everyone else and everyone else didn\u2019t deserve to be his equal.\u201d his eyes were liquid bright when they looked up at Thor, filled with unshed tears but unwilling to back down. \u201cHe killed them and he was going to kill me and the only reason I\u2019m alive is because my mum loved me so much she protected me even after she was dead.\u201d\u00a0\nThor could only stare at the boy who was meant to be his other half. He stood there with such grief and pain in his gaze, and yet even still he stood up against him, someone many times his size, and refused to stand down.\u00a0\nHe wanted to rage and scream at how unjust it was that his soulmate had felt such grief - such terror at such a young age, when all he wanted was for people to live safely and in peace. It put his own actions in sharp relief. When had he not fought? When had he not killed any who would stand against him on the field of battle? Though he wanted to believe his actions were justified, in the face of this boy\u2019s pain, he could feel nothing but shame.\u00a0\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure if he was apologizing for his own actions, or for those brought against his soulmate, but he was sorry all the same. Harry blinked at him, surprise clear on his features. All of the ferocity that had been visible in his expression faded back behind discomfort as he scuffed a shoe against the ground.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize to me. You didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps not, though I damaged your opinion of me, and for that I am also sorry. I would not have you think less of me.\u201d And those huge green eyes stared at him, wide.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think less of you.\u201d the boy hurried to assure. \u201cYou\u2019re my soulmate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d and there was insecurity there now. Thor could not have his other half being so uncertain of their bond. He moved forward, lowering to a knee in front of the boy.\u00a0\n\u201cAye. We are bound.\u201d he offered a hand and watched the indecision flit over Harry\u2019s expression. The longer he watched, the more he realized that the hardships Harry had shared with him were not the only ones he\u2019d faced. It was obvious now that it was not just his own worth he doubted but that he deserved such a thing as a soulmate. Thor vowed to prove otherwise. If he was to spend time\u00a0here on Midgard, he would spend it all making sure his soulmate knew he was cared for and deserved such care.\u00a0\nAs he didn\u2019t remove the hand despite Harry\u2019s hesitancy, the boy slowly put his hand in Thor\u2019s. The moment contact was made, the light between them flared before tempering out. Harry sucked in a sharp breath but didn\u2019t pull away, and Thor was sure he made a similar sound, though he was focused on the boy in front of him. From this close, he could see even more clearly just how young he was, but beyond that, how small he was. Far too small in Thor\u2019s opinion.\n\u201cWow.\u201d the boy breathed, and Thor didn\u2019t even try to contain his grin.\n\u201cAye.\u201d he repeated, warmth spreading through him.\u00a0\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d Harry asked, still looking nervous but making no move to pull his hand away.\u00a0\n\u201cNow I can only strive to prove to you I am worthy of such a title as being your soulmate.\u201d Harry stared in surprise.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove anything to me. I\u2019m just Harry.\u201d Thor shook his head. It seemed he had more to prove than he\u2019d initially thought.\u00a0\n\u201cYou are the only one I must prove myself to.\u201d Thor countered. \u201cUntil then, I would hope you would allow me to remain by your side as your friend. I would protect you from any further hardship.\u201d For now, that\u2019s what the boy needed - a friend. Anything else could come with time. For now, Thor was content to be both the boy\u2019s sword and shield until a time when he was old enough that they could stand side by side.\u00a0\n\u201cYou - you want to stay with me?\u201d Thor nodded, sincere.\n\u201cThere is nowhere else I would rather be.\u201d Not even the thought of the halls of Asgard called him now. Knowing his soulmate was here, so young and vulnerable and clearly mistreated, he could not imagine being anywhere else. He watched the tentative smile spread over Harry\u2019s features, and he returned the expression easily. Standing, he offered his hand once more, helping Harry clamber over the large collection of roots between them.\u00a0\n\u201cShall we then, Harry?\u201d and he didn\u2019t comment on the tight grip Harry kept on him, or how he kept darting glances in his direction, surprised and pleased in turn. Once they were well on their way to returning to wherever Harry had come from, he spoke once more. \u201cWhere is it we are going?\u201d Harry\u2019s smile was tentative once more, but excited all the same.\n\u201cI live at Hogwarts. It\u2019s a school for witchcraft and wizardry.\u201d his cheeks tinged pink, embarrassed even as he was clearly pleased. \u201cI\u2019m a wizard.\u201d Thor could only blink in surprise before he offered a blinding grin. His soulmate could use magic, just as his brother could.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very impressive.\u201d he announced. Harry\u2019s smile became a little more confident.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d he admitted, and Thor beamed back.\u00a0\n\u201cThen I look forward to being able to witness your growth as a Seidr.\u201d\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\u201cA user of magic.\u201d Thor explained, glad that for once that he was able to share his knowledge. Harry nodded, expression thoughtful. When they were clear of the forest Harry paused, looking up at the castle up ahead, and Thor could admit to finding it beautiful. It lacked the majesty of Asgard, but there was something haunting about it that he was sure would stick with him for years to come.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hogwarts.\u201d Harry told him, voice reverent. Thor made sure his expression was one of appropriate appreciation.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd this is where you live?\u201d\n\u201cDuring school, yeah.\u201d There was something about the way Harry wouldn\u2019t quite meet his gaze that told him he would have to ask about just what about Harry\u2019s life outside of school made him quite so skittish, but knew now wasn\u2019t the time. Then Harry was looking up at him in a panic, hand tightening around his. \u201cWhat if they won\u2019t let you stay with me? Since you\u2019re not a student?\u201d\n\u201cI imagine not even the Seidr of Midgard would risk separating soulmates once they are bound, regardless of age.\u201d but Harry didn\u2019t look relieved.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay with me, though. It\u2019s probably boring. There\u2019s only kids here.\u201d Thor lowered to a knee once more so Harry could see directly into his eyes, and know his words for the truth they were.\u00a0He kept Harry's hand in his and placed his\u00a0free hand on the boy's shoulder.\n\u201cI would not wish to be anywhere you were not, Harry. You are my bonded, as I am yours. I wish to remain by your side. Nothing could convince me otherwise.\u201d his smile then was wry. \u201cI will repeat myself as often as necessary until you believe me.\u201d and Harry looked surprised he was willing to do such a thing. Thor did not like what that implied about Harry\u2019s childhood. Once more, he pushed the thought aside. It didn\u2019t matter. Not yet. All that mattered, was making sure he could remain with his bonded.\u00a0\n\u201cNow then, take me to the ruler of this castle.\u201d Harry cracked a smile, eyes sparkling with laughter.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a ruler, exactly. Just the headmaster. I\u2019ll take you to his office.\u201d Thor nodded imperiously.\n\u201cOnwards!\u201d and that did spark a laughter from Harry.\n\u201cOnwards.\u201d he repeated, giggling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe weeks after falling to Midgard were strange but not unwelcome. He learned much about the magical world and its schooling - much about the school and its residents - and a fair amount about his bonded himself. It turned out the boy was famous - but it rankled to know he was famous for an event that had brought him such pain and that people were constantly reminding him of that pain.\nHe\u2019d met the Headmaster of the school on his very first night as well as the potions master, and he could say he wasn\u2019t particularly pleased with either. He knew the moment he met the headmaster Albus Dumbledore that the elder wizard was scheming around his young soulmate, and he did not appreciate the endangerment of children, bonded or not. As for the potions master, one Severus Snape, he had been hard pressed not to speak against him considering how he spoke to young Harry, but as Harry hadn\u2019t seemed too upset he let it be for now.\u00a0\nThor scooped some eggs into his mouth, looking out across the great hall. He could see Harry chatting amiably with his two closest friends, Ron and Hermione, and he grinned at the boy when he chanced a glance at the head table. Harry flushed but grinned right back. On his left, professor Minerva McGonagall let out a soft huff of laughter. He turned a questioning look on her, expectant, and she indulged him with a small smile.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him quite this happy before.\u201d She admitted. \u201cExcept maybe when he\u2019s flying.\u201d It took Thor a minute to connect flying with the game she\u2019d previously explained to him, quidditch. He quite like Minerva - she\u2019d been especially welcoming, and she\u2019d even lobbied for him to hold a class of sorts of his own - Mythology and the Stars. It was in the evenings after sundown a few times a week. After all, she\u2019d argued, who better to teach the stories of the stars than someone who\u2019d lived many of them? And she didn\u2019t believe in anyone being idle.\u00a0\nThen he caught on to just what she\u2019d said.\n\u201cWas he not happy then? Before?\u201d Before his arrival - before he truly believed he had a soulmate. Minerva shrugged elegantly, but her frown was telling.\u00a0\n\u201cThose muggles,\u201d And she stopped herself, offering him an apologetic look. \u201cHis non-magical relatives,\u201d she corrected, \u201cthey hate him.\u201d And there was bitterness in her voice. A ferocious anger that flashed briefly in her eyes that surprised him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy have you allowed him to live there if you knew they mistreated him?\u201d Because he knew that\u2019s what she meant by her words. He also knew it explained Harry\u2019s visceral reactions to some things; how he flinched if someone moved too quickly just out of sight, how he always seemed to know exactly where the exit was.\u00a0\n\u201cI haven\u2019t a choice.\u201d She snapped, then softened her voice, apologetic once more. \u201cHe needs the protection only blood can offer.\u201d She admitted. And he\u2019d heard by now the story of Harry\u2019s fame - of how his mother and father stood between him and death knowing it meant their own end in turn.\n\u201cI am more his than any other.\u201d Thor said then, without really thinking, because he was literally the other half of Harry\u2019s soul, as Harry was the other half of his. She blinked at him, surprised, before a light lit in her gaze, and a small smile curved her lips.\u00a0\n\u201cI dare say you\u2019re right, Mr. Odinson.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Lady Minerva. I would have you address me by name as you have allowed me the same courtesy.\u201d And her cheeks flushed a soft pink but she nodded. They didn\u2019t speak of the matter again, but Thor knew the look of someone turning an idea around in their thoughts and Minerva had that look.\u00a0\nAfter breakfast, when Thor had decided he would like to explore more of the castle, he was surprised to find Harry waiting for him, looking rather nervous. Thor offered his hand and Harry was quick to take it, fingers gripping his nearly as tightly as they had that very first night. Thor didn\u2019t say anything until they\u2019d wandered together out onto the grounds, well out of earshot of everyone else.\u00a0\n\u201cIs everything alright, Harry?\u201d He often found himself at odds, having to ask. It had never been something he\u2019d been particularly good at - guessing at the moods of others. It had always been a skill of his brother really, but he found himself wanting to learn, if only so he could help Harry as he grew. Harry shrugged, and the look he shot him was pinched with worry. \u201cYou know there is nothing you could tell me that would turn me against you.\u201d He reminded him, for what felt like the millionth time, but he knew he\u2019d say it a million more if that\u2019s what it took for Harry to believe him.\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d And Harry said it with such surety, and with the hints of a smile. It filled Thor with warmth.\u00a0\n\u201cThen what is it that troubles you?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t answer right away. It was clear he wanted to share whatever it was on his mind, but it was equally as clear that whatever it was, Thor would probably not like it. Else Harry wouldn\u2019t be so hesitant.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I told you Voldemort wasn\u2019t dead, what would you say?\u201d Thor stopped in his tracks, turning to fully face Harry.\u00a0\n\u201cIs it true? Is the one who murdered your family alive?\u201d It filled him with such a burning rage he had to force through it to make sure he didn\u2019t miss a single thing Harry said - a single expression he made. Harry\u2019s face held that pinched expression once more before he nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cYes. At least, we\u2019re pretty sure.\u201d Thor didn\u2019t have to ask who the \u2018we\u2019 was. \u201cWe think he\u2019s not really fully alive, but half, I guess. But that he\u2019s trying to come back. Completely.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe philosophers stone.\u201d And then the story just tumbled from Harry\u2019s lips, everything that had happened since the beginning of the year - the troll - the nightmares he still had - the mirror he\u2019d found and what he\u2019d seen. He told him about the detention and what they\u2019d encountered\u00a0in the forest and Fluffy -\n\u201cIt seems you were bound for adventure even before you met me.\u201d Thor interrupted with a grin when Harry paused for breath. Harry stared at him for just long enough he feared he\u2019d jested in poor taste before Harry burst out laughing.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Then he beamed at Thor, pleased as punch, and Thor could do nothing but beam right back.\n\u201cRight then. What would you have me do?\u201d And that earned Harry\u2019s surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cDo?\u201d And it was clear he hadn\u2019t really meant to ask, but Thor was proud of the fact that Harry was getting comfortable enough with him to speak without really thinking. He\u2019d realized, the more time he spent with Harry, that he\u2019d been far luckier than most to be allowed such freedom.\u00a0\n\u201cYou did not think I would allow you to partake in such a task by yourself, did you?\u201d He asked, making sure to keep his tone soft. \u201cI would help you, if you\u2019ll allow it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d Was Harry\u2019s immediate reply, but Thor shook his head.\n\u201cNo. I will not intervene unless you allow it. This is your task. You have solved this mystery. It is your quest. I am only welcome upon your invitation.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re a grown up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am also your soulmate.\u201d Thor returned easily. \u201cYou have as much control over me as I do you.\u201d Harry blinked at him, looking distraught. \u201cWhat I mean is - I have no control over you, beyond what I would ask of you. But you always have the ability to decline, do you not?\u201d Harry nodded slowly. \u201cAs your bonded, it is much the same. Though the reverse, in this case. I would like to aid you in your task. Will you allow it?\u201d Harry stared at him with such wide, solemn green eyes before he nodded. As soon as he\u2019d done so he launched forward, catching Thor by surprise and hugging him tightly.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Thor realized it wasn\u2019t the help he\u2019d offered he was being thanked for, but for allowing Harry the choice. Not trusting his voice, Thor just hugged him back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeimdall.\u201d Thor called, standing in the very place he\u2019d fallen to Earth. He realized he hadn\u2019t even looked for a way home since he\u2019d found Harry - hadn\u2019t even really thought to ask for guidance. \u201cI am not calling on you to come home. I know now that I have made mistakes, and that I must learn from them. I would ask a favour though. I would ask that you call Loki for me. There are Seidr on this planet and I do not know nearly enough about their ways\u00a0to be much help. But - as I am sure you have seen - I have found my bonded. He is in danger - hunted - by a man who is said to control great magicks. I would seek my brother\u2019s council.\u201d he bowed his head, unsure of whether he should say more, and then he gave a wry smile. This was what he still had to learn, he supposed. \u201cThank you.\u201d he said to the sky instead, and then he turned and walked back to the castle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\u00a0\n\u201cThor.\u201d Harry, hidden by the chair who\u2019s back was to the figure, all but fell out of his chair in his haste to spin around, wand in hand and pointing at the intruder to Thor's private sitting room. The man in the doorway lifted a brow of surprise before a small smile curled his lips in amusement. \u201cSo this is your bonded.\u201d Harry glanced at Thor and the blonde immediately stepped forward, placing a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou have nothing to fear, Harry. This is my brother, Loki. I called to him, seeking his council.\u201d Harry just looked back at Loki, still not speaking, and Loki, in turn, frowned at Harry.\u00a0\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d He asked, tilting his head as he regarded him. Harry looked up at Thor again, but when Thor smiled encouragingly, he finally spoke.\u00a0\n\u201c11.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating.\u201d he came forward then and Harry jerked back, colliding with Thor who steadied him easily. Loki raised his hands in the universal sign of surrender, but he crouched down so he was eye to eye with Harry.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve not one but two magical signatures on your person. Only one of which reflects your true age.\u201d Loki informed him, and Harry blinked back.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Loki lifted a hand but didn\u2019t reach out, looking at Harry instead. When Harry gave a slow nod of permission, Loki reached out, touch gentle, and brushed his fingers against Harry\u2019s lightning bolt scar. The pulse of pain was brief and intense and Harry realized he must have lost consciousness briefly because next thing he knew he was sitting in the chair once more, Thor at his side but Loki kneeling in front of him now.\u00a0\n\u201cMy sincerest apologies.\u201d Loki offered, frown in place. \u201cI had no idea it would fight even the touch of magic.\u201d Harry blinked, his head pounding, but he cleared his throat. He had questions.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat - what is it?\u201d\n\u201cA piece of a soul.\u201d Loki said, glancing at Thor. Harry followed his gaze and saw Thor looked beyond enraged. He shrank back from it. If he had someone else's soul attached to him -\u00a0\n\u201cDoes that mean you aren\u2019t really my soulmate?\u201d He asked, voice small, and it was Loki who answered with a scoff.\u00a0\n\u201cIgnore him.\u201d he ordered, making Harry jump. \u201cHis reaction to everything is anger first because he is an oaf who uses brute strength when cunning would do. The piece of soul that inhabits your scar has no affect on your splitting.\u201d Loki cast a glare at Thor though his words were aimed at Harry. \u201cHe clearly has no idea that you would regard his anger as directed at you when you clearly know as little about soul magic as he does.\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t certain if he was supposed to be insulted by that or not.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to learn.\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut the books are locked up. And I\u2019ve only been able to sneak in once or twice.\u201d and his cheeks pinked. Loki smirked, the expression pleased.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve certainly got the brains between the two of you. If you\u2019d like, I can provide you with the sorts of books I imagine you\u2019re looking for. That this place would keep them from you only proves their inadequacy.\u201d then he waved a hand, clearly done with the subject for now as his sharp gaze focused on Harry\u2019s scar once more.\u00a0\n\u201cCould the piece of soul cause nightmares?\u201d Thor interrupted, and Harry looked back up at him in surprise. Thor placed a hand on his shoulder, expression apologetic. Harry leaned into the touch, accepting.\n\u201cOf course. What do you see in your nightmares?\u201d Harry was silent, looking at his hands, face pale. He\u2019d told Thor about his nightmares, but it felt weird telling his brother. The brother he\u2019d only just met. He looked back at Loki who was watching him patiently, and realized that Thor obviously really trusted Loki if he\u2019d called for him, and he trusted Thor.\u00a0\n\u201cMy mum. When she dies. I hear her scream my name. Then a laugh. Then bright green light. Then my scar hurts so much I wake up.\u201d Loki\u2019s expression had grown more and more severe as he\u2019d spoken and he nodded, looking back to Thor.\n\u201cThe wizard you called me for.\u201d and it wasn\u2019t really a question, but Thor nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cI did not realize-\u201d but Loki waved off his words before he could even really speak them. He looked back to Harry.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to stop him?\u201d and Harry frowned.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course.\u201d but Loki\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed, was just watching him, expectant. Harry took a deep breath, trying to organize his thoughts. He was only 11, he\u2019d never considered the fact that he might have to make such a decision. He was fairly sure he was too young to really make it properly, but both of these people were looking to him for a decision. He wondered if it was a test. Harry took a breath.\u00a0\n\u201cHe killed my parents.\u201d he said slowly, brow scrunched in focus. \u201cI think he killed a lot of people, really, and he tried to kill me. I think people are so scared they won\u2019t even say his name, which means if he really did come back he would try to kill people again. All he cares about is power. He just wants to control everyone. Killing people because you want power is wrong.\u201d and Harry nodded, firm, confident now. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. I want to stop him.\u201d and when he met the gaze of both brother\u2019s, they were watching him with varied expressions of pride.\u00a0\n\u201cVery well. In order to stop him, we\u2019ll have to make sure there is nothing tethering him to this world. Fortunately for us, he is tethered here, to your scar. With that, we can find and make sure there is nothing else left of him in\u00a0this world\u00a0- then I can remove the fragment from you as well. What do you say?\u201d and Harry nodded fervently. Loki stood then, looking at Thor, and his expression was amused.\n\u201cIt seems even in banishment you manage to involve yourself in world changing events.\u201d Thor grinned, wide and bright.\n\u201cThis journey\u00a0is that of my bonded.\u201d he boasted, and Loki rolled his eyes. \u201cI am only able to join because he gave his permission.\u201d Loki turned a curious gaze on Harry once more.\n\u201cHe asked to join you?\u201d Harry nodded, confused.\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s always my choice.\u201d he didn\u2019t really understand why Loki\u2019s expression went all soft, or why he reached out then to clap a hand to Thor\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cI will join you properly in a day\u2019s time.\u201d and then with that, he disappeared from sight. Harry just blinked at Thor who smiled at him in turn.\u00a0\n\u201cIt would seem we have a proper quest on our hands.\u201d Harry offered a tentative smile back.\u00a0\n\u201cOnwards?\u201d Harry asked, almost cautious, mimicking their first decision to stay together. Thor ruffled his hair, pleased and affectionate in his agreement.\u00a0\n\u201cOnwards.\u201d\u00a0"
