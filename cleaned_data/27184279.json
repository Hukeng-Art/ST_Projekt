    "text": "Lan Xichen knows that war makes for odd bedfellows. Sworn brothers, in particular, often lend one another a helping hand.\u00a0\nSuch pragmatic arrangements are common between warriors for reasons of both public health and basic decency. It is an effective way of biding one\u2019s time until one is able to marry. Cheaper than visiting a brothel, and with no risk of siring children out of wedlock in wartime. And among decent people, it is considered manlier to spend one\u2019s time with a fellow warrior than it is to harass the women on the warfront - whether they be fellow warriors, healers, cooks, or prisoners. Exchanging dry handjobs with one\u2019s shield brother while doing one\u2019s absolute best to manifest a woman in the room through sheer force of will is not precisely satisfying, but it serves its purpose until peace is won and one can meet, wed, and bed the love of one\u2019s life.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Xichen and his good friend Nie Mingjue become sworn brothers in the second year of the cultivation world\u2019s campaign against Wen Ruohan, and soon thereafter commence exchanging mutually dispassionate warfront handjobs.\u00a0\nIn the fourth year of the campaign, Lan Xichen\u2019s brother Wangji and Wangji\u2019s friend Wei Wuxian also swear brotherhood to one another. Then they, too, commence such exchanges. Rather more loudly than most of the other men in camp - they\u2019re young, after all.\u00a0\n\u2014\nIn Wei Wuxian\u2019s humble opinion, they were all stuck in the Wen indoctrination camp for too long. Much longer than any of the others he spoke to had expected it to be when they were sent there. In the private moments they stole in captivity, Wei Wuxian and Lan Zhan agreed that the Wens themselves also seemed surprised by how long the indoctrination camp went on.\u00a0\nIt took about three years for them to escape, and even then, it was only because they got sent on a bullshit cave spelunking expedition.\u00a0\nThe sword Wei Wuxian got in the process was cool, though.\u00a0\nBy the time he and Lan Zhan make it out and get to the warfront, the campaign is years old. Wei Wuxian has been flirting with demonic cultivation for nearly as long - enough to be a big help against Wen Ruohan\u2019s puppets. He and Lan Zhan have a whole routine where Lan Zhan helps him wash away the resentful energy afterwards.\u00a0\nThey become shield brothers shortly after they get to the warfront. They\u2019ve been through a lot together at that point. They feel quite confident in one anothers\u2019 loyalty; an oath doesn\u2019t actually feel necessary. They mostly do it so that they can get assigned to the same front.\n\u2014\nOn the front, they share a tent. The war is bitter. Grueling. They don\u2019t ever do the weird shield brothers thing where you jack one another off while staring into opposite corners of the tent. Lan Zhan is much too dignified, and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t see the point.\u00a0\nInstead, they skip straight to actual fucking.\u00a0\nThe first time is late at night. Wei Wuxian is a shameless drunk, and it just kind of\u2026 happens. It\u2019s heady and intense, because it feels like the world is fucking ending around them - they\u2019re at war, after all. The second time comes the next morning, when Wei Wuxian tries to brush it off, and Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t let him. Turns out that Lan Zhan is shameless sober.\u00a0\nTheir third time is later that very same evening. So late it might be morning. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re for real until that one. The first time, he was shocked that it was happening at all. The second time, he was confused. Wondering what it meant, instead of thinking about what they meant to each other.\u00a0\nBut the third time, it clicks. Lan Zhan grabs his chin hard and bites his lower lip. \u201cLook into my eyes when you come,\u201d he growls.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian takes Lan Zhan in deep and looks into his eyes and comes so intensely that his foot threatens to cramp. He feels owned, and he feels like he owns Lan Zhan in turn. If this is the end of their world, then at least they have this. At least it\u2019s real.\u00a0\n(Even if Lan Zhan takes another two weeks to mention that they\u2019ve actually already been married for  years. The big baby.)\n\u2014\nOne of Lan Xichen\u2019s proudest memories from the war is seeing his brother stride confidently out of the text he shared with his shield brother and straight into an emergency strategy session, Wei Wuxian hot on his heels.\u00a0\nWangji and Wei Wuxian could have been summoned away from doing any number of things, but realistically, it was likely that they had been\u2026 biding time with one another when they were called into the session: their robes were quite disheveled. Sleep robes are not worn on a warfront, and given that failing to carry one\u2019s sword may mean a swift death by the enemy, undressing regularly is unwise. Loosely-tied day robes are the closest thing a warrior has to comfortable clothing. Their untidy appearances and stiff gaits spoke of hasty redressing, among other things.\nA bit embarrassing for the both of them, but all in all, Lan Xichen was rather pleased for Wangji. Perhaps proud. Wangji had never made friends easily, and here he was, with the closest kind of friend a man could have.\nEither way, Wangji was not phased to be pulled out of repose. In his quiet, stern way, contributed useful insights on troop placement. Wei Wuxian also proved himself with observations on the Wens\u2019 resource allocation gleaned during their time in captivity. If Wangji was to only have one friend, Lan Xichen thought that Wei Wuxian was an excellent choice for him.\u00a0\nHe thought to himself,  ah, much pain comes of war, but isn\u2019t it a joy to see my little brother coming into his own and becoming a man?\u00a0 \n\u2014\nWhen the war finally ends, Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue part ways with a clap on the back, glad to begin the work of rebuilding and starting up their own adult lives.\u00a0\nWangji and Wei Wuxian\u2026 do not. They stay completely attached. So much so that Wei Wuxian even moves back to the Cloud Recesses with Wangji.\u00a0\nAh, it would be hypocritical of Lan Xichen to decry their closeness now. Yes, it is sad that Lan Xichen\u2019s brother is stuck in that youthful holding pattern (that is, exchanging handjobs with one\u2019s shield brother while imagining a beautiful lady) rather than moving on to more adult pursuits. But Lan Xichen himself was the one who initially encouraged Wangji to become friends with Wei Wuxian, thinking it would help him open up. And then they were hostages - prisoners of war - together in Nightless City for nearly three years. Wei Wuxian helped Wangji when he was injured - tortured - by the Wens. It is completely understandable that they became reliant on one another.\u00a0\nNow that the war is over, Wangji does seem so much more open and happy than he was as a boy. He smiles sometimes, mostly at Wei Wuxian. Once, he even took an afternoon off. At sixteen, Wangji would never have done such a thing; clearly, Wei Wuxian\u2019s influence has helped him grow.\u00a0\n\u2014\nDuring Indoctrination Camp at the hands of the Wen, Wei Wuxian begged anyone who seemed halfway receptive for medicine for Lan Zhan\u2019s leg. Or a day of rest. Recovery still took Lan Zhan a long time. So much longer than it should have. Than it would have, had he been given even two straight days off of his feet. Out of necessity, Wei Wuxian bonded with several members of the medicine-oriented branch of the Wen clan, which hails from Dafan Mountain. They were kind people. Oh, not necessarily to his face. But their actions said more than enough. By the end of the first year of Indoctrination Camp, Wen Qing had a system worked out. She would insist on taking breaks during long marches through the forest so that she could gather herbs. Would cut a day short by an hour or so whenever she could manage it. Would rotate Dafan Mountain Wens into the group minding the hostages, who would then smuggle medicine, \u201coverlook\u201d doubled recipes, and switch out their full canteens with the prisoners\u2019 empty ones.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian met A-Yuan in the second year of Indoctrination Camp. Wen Ning brought him by on a rare day when Wen Chao wasn\u2019t there to heckle the group. (The prisoners became less novel to Wen Chao as time went on.)\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet,\u201d Wen Ning had told Wei Wuxian. \u201cMy assistant for the day. My cousin A-Yuan.\u201d\n\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated, staring at the boy holding small sprigs of herbs in two chubby fists.\u00a0\nA-Yuan stared up at him, blinked, and broke into a wide, almost-toothy grin. \u201cHi!\u201d he chirped, and - and - wandered up to hug Wei Wuxian\u2019s knee.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, helplessly bending down to his level and scooping him up in a quick hug. Not a smart thing to do, but a completely irresistible reflex. \u201cOh, a  baby,\u201d  he said, feeling his tiny shoulders under Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm and his soft hair below Wei Wuxian\u2019s chin. Fuck. Wei Wuxian missed training the little kids at home  so much.\u00a0 \nWen Ning grinned proudly - Wei Wuxian sees the family resemblance - and said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d\n\u201cA baby,\u201d Wei Ying said again.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big kid,\u201d A-Yuan said softly, tucked somewhere against Wei Wuxian\u2019s ribcage, but he didn\u2019t seem too upset.\u00a0\nLater that day, when Wei Wuxian found a safe moment to send a paperman to Lan Zhan, all he could talk about was how there was  A baby, Lan Zhan, you don\u2019t understand. He was a baby. Oh, he was so good. \n\u201cMn,\u201d was all that Lan Zhan said under his breath, but it was warm.\u00a0\n\u2014\nAfter the war, Wei Wuxian and Wen Qing find one another, and they get help for the other Wen remnants from Lan Zhan and Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli. (She makes Wei Wuxian write a heartfelt thank-you note to Jin Zixuan for taking in so many refugees. It\u2019s awful.)\u00a0\nSomehow, in the ensuing negotiations, he and Lan Zhan end up with custody of A-Yuan, which just cements the fact that, of course, he\u2019s going to follow his husband back to Gusu. The romantic notion of roving the world and cultivating together can wait; they have a little one who\u2019s been through a lot. He deserves to learn and grow in a stable environment like the Cloud Recesses. So off they all go to Gusu. A brand new little family.\u00a0\n\u2014\nAs the war dragged on, Lan Xichen came to understand that Wen Ruohan\u2019s quest for power did not only harm outsiders. They received two reports that common Wen soldiers were killed for losing a skirmish. They recognized faces across the battlefield - not just their own dead, made wrong, but the Wen clan\u2019s dead, too. And they found ghosts - or ghosts found them - who would lament that their own town\u2019s sect turned its back on them. So there is some sympathy for the few Wen survivors. Especially once survivors of the Indoctrination Camp like Wei Wuxian and Wangij themselves vouch for the Dafan Mountain Wens\u2019 less-than-bloodthirsty ways.\nAfter much deliberation on the part of the sects left standing, it is agreed that the Wen remnants can settle and rejoin society - with the caveat that they must be split up, lest they gain strength in numbers. Wangji seems rather upset with Lan Xichen for backing this plan, but he helps to coordinate the resettlement effort. And as Wangji carefully facilitates the placement of the various Wen remnants, Wei Wuxian moving to the Cloud Recesses somehow becomes integral to the proceedings.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWhen Jiang Cheng sees an opportunity, he takes it. He\u2019s a sect leader now. Sect leaders don\u2019t hesitate.\u00a0\nWhen talk about resettlement starts, Jiang Cheng insists on getting Wen Qing and her brother. (He and Wen Qing came to an understanding during the second year of the war - they wanted to be together, but couldn\u2019t think about it just yet.)\nDuring the bullshit negotiation that ensues, he doesn\u2019t get to talk to her a lot, but they hammered out what the Wen remnants wanted beforehand. He ends up with Wen Ning and Wen Qing in Lotus Pier proper, and various other Wens are settled into trades in Yunmeng.\nThere are two big worries about Wens going to Lotus Pier. The first is political: Wen Qing and Wen Ning are the highest-ranking Wens still around. The cultivation world wants assurance that they won\u2019t try to \u201ctake over\u201d Lotus Pier - Sect Leader Yao\u2019s words - by moving there en masse. The second is practical: Lotus Pier and Yunmeng as a whole are rebuilding on a greater scale than any other major sect. During the Sunshot Campaign, several of the sects were razed, their seats of power fallen into disrepair. Lotus Pier suffered worse destruction at the Wens\u2019 hands than most. And, thanks to its famous humidity, it deteriorated further after that, with the few buildings left standing moldering or rotting outright.\u00a0\nThe next five or so years will be a little rough in Yunmeng. For the very old, that could be all they have left. For the very young, that\u2019s five years they should be spending getting a steady education.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng\u2019s wonderful brother, Wei Wuxian, solves both problems by agreeing to go to Gusu with Lan Wangji and lay low with the elderly Wens who would struggle in a still-rebuilding region like Yunmeng, and the single child, who needs an education that Lotus Pier can\u2019t currently ensure.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian is easygoing about the whole thing. He usually is. He isn\u2019t happy about the Wens splitting up at all, but he promises Wen Qing he\u2019ll look after everyone personally, and facilitate visits whenever they want.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng truly appreciates his brother\u2019s heroic sacrifice. It is so noble of him, to spend his time taking care of a toddler with that stick-in-the-mud Lan Wangji, just so that he, Jiang Cheng, can have a girlfriend.\n\u2014\nJiang Wanyin, the new Sect Leader of Yunmeng, stepped up admirably, taking in more than twenty Wen remnants. Lan Xichen recalls commending him for this during the postwar conference. He had been standing close to Wen Qing. They spoke in low tones, looking intently at one another. Clearly discussing the practical matters regarding resettlement.\u00a0\n\u201cI understand that Yunmeng will be taking in a number of Wen remnants,\u201d Lan Xichen had said, with a bow to both. \u201cThis is a commendable sacrifice, especially given the losses Yunmeng has suffered.\u201d\nJiang Cheng had looked to Wen Qing, then to him, and said slowly, \u201cYes. Thank you, Zewu Jun. A true\u2026 sacrifice. To take in Wen Qing and her family.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are bearing your upheaval admirably as well, Wen Qing,\u201d Lan Xichen acknowledged.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she had said hesitantly, a glint in her eye that Lan Xichen could almost take for amusement. \u201cI am honored by Jiang Wanyin\u2019s\u2026 sacrifice?\u201d\nLan Xichen nodded serenely and continued on his way, content with how things had turned out.\u00a0\n\u2014\nSo Wangji arrives at the Cloud Recesses several months following the conclusion of the war with Wei Wuxian, several elderly Wen remnants, and a child in tow.\u00a0\nThe elderly Wen remnants settle in Gusu comfortably. People from all walks of life died during the war, and elders with skills to teach are welcome in Caiyi Town and the surrounding villages.\u00a0\nA-Yuan is welcomed into the Lan sect\u2019s pre-C (pre-cultivation) courses. Wei Wuxian, too, appears to feel at home in the Cloud Recesses almost immediately.\u00a0\nWangji and Wei Wuxian did not swear fealty in a public ceremony as Lan Xichen, Nie Mingjue, and Jin Guangyao did. But upon relocating to the Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian pledges his loyalty before the council of Lan elders. He takes traditional Lan vows, ones often invoked to declare family and clan loyalty. He swears to act virtuously, to be true to his link to the sect (in this case, Wangji), and to raise his children to respect the Lan disciplines. With great gravity and dignity, Wangji reciprocates the same vows in front of the same witnesses, which is only fair.\u00a0\nLan Xichen wonders if their parents took the same vows, perhaps in this very hall, maybe even in front of a few of the same witnesses. It is a sobering thought, but his mood stays light. The whole thing is a rather ingenious idea of his little brother\u2019s, really. Wei Wuxian\u2019s declaration will certainly serve to assure the Lan clan elders that Wei Wuxian has the Cloud Recesses\u2019 best interests at heart, and that Wangji trusts him to honor the clan - they even hand-fast using Wangji\u2019s ribbon, signifying that Wei Wuxian, while an outsider, is as worthy of trust as any true Lan. It is rather amusing, in a sweet way, to watch them declare themselves brothers with such fierce sincerity.\u00a0\n\u2014\nThe child who arrived with Wangji and Wei Wuxian following the conclusion of the war is a source of some confusion for Lan Xichen. It is not of grave importance, of course, but Lan Xichen does not\u2026 understand. Exactly. Whose baby A-Yuan is. The baby has to be a Wen, right? Do Wei Wuxian and Wangji even know? They appear unworried. No one seems as confused by the situation as Lan Xichen is.\nAmongst the Lan clan, it is considered unseemly to ask after a child\u2019s parentage. Lan Xichen could not say whether or not this unspoken rule was in place before he and Wangji were born, but he is grateful for the strife it spared him in his own childhood. As such, he cannot justifiably ask where A-Yuan came from.\u00a0\nWhat Lan Xichen knows is this: A-Yuan arrived with no parents. War orphans are not unheard of, but Wei Wuxian takes such  particular interest in A-Yuan\u2019s well-being that Lan Xichen has to wonder if perhaps he is the father. If that is the case, however, how did Wangji get roped into helping to look after Wei Wuxian\u2019s byblow?\nOn the other hand\u2026 Wei Wuxian often declares that A-Yuan resembles Wangji. Indeed, he does. It is difficult to determine whether that is due to inherent qualities, or his quiet demeanor paired with the Lan robes.\nLan Xichen thinks he would have noticed his brother fathering a child. Most likely. But Wangji was held in Nightless City for years with many other cultivators. Who is to say what Lan Xichen missed? He will not ask about this, either; if his brother - the sect\u2019s head of discipline - fathered a bastard, plausible deniability is everyone\u2019s friend.\nLan Xichen will admit that he does not actually understand the exact mechanics of conception. Oh, the act, he has a theoretical knowledge of. But the obscure processes that take place inside of a woman\u2019s body afterwards, the ones that eventually result in a child, are not a standard part of the Lan Sect curriculum.\u00a0\nHe wonders, at times, if perhaps both Wei Wuxian and Wangji could have fathered A-Yuan. If they both  took  A-Yuan\u2019s mysteriously absent mother, could it\u2026 ah. Lan Xichen might ask Nie Mingjue - his shield brother has a strong understanding of the carnal world, given his relatively easy access to certain lewd materials and the bawdier warrior culture of the Nie clan - but. For all that Lan Xichen is less uptight and reserved than his brother is, he cannot imagine asking Nie Mingjue,  if two men take the same woman, is it theoretically possible for it to\u2026 mix up in there?\u00a0 \nPerhaps he should ask Wen Qing, the next time he is in Yunmeng. She is a famous doctor, and a cultivator, at that. She must know how it works. Oh, perhaps Wen Qing is the mother? Hm. No, Sandu Shengshou is an ornery man, but a righteous one. He would have insisted on keeping A-Yuan with his mother, if that were the case.\u00a0\nTruly, Lan Xichen is at a loss. As he does with most things that confuse him, he resolves to simply be at peace with that and not to question it further.\n\u2014\nA-Yuan is chattering happily with Wei Ying about his lessons and his friend A-Yi and his firm belief that he is definitely old enough to start training with live steel, A-die, he\u2019s not a  baby  anymore.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you aren\u2019t,\u201d Wei Ying scoffs. \u201cRemember when I planted you in the garden? You\u2019re a radish.\u201d\n\u201cAm not!\u201d A-Yuan says. He grins, belying his indignant tone.\u00a0\n\u201cAh, you surely are, but either way, you\u2019ll be my baby forever, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying says, a hand darting out to pinch A-Yuan\u2019s cheek.\u00a0\nHis tone is teasing. Privately, Wei Ying and Lan Wangji have agreed that A-Yuan may begin training with a blunted blade on his next birthday, which is only a few months away. It will be a surprise.\u00a0\nA-Yuan stomps his foot and reaches for Wei Ying. Wei Ying darts out of the way, initiating a game of tag.\u00a0\nLan Wangji continues to set out their food. His Wei Ying will herd their son over before long. Perhaps later, they will play one of his new compositions. A wholly satisfactory afternoon.\u00a0\n\u2014\nIn the late spring and summer, Wangji and Wei Wuxian often picnic with A-Yuan in the western meadow after the child is released from his introductory disciple training. A-Yuan seems delighted to show off what he has learned to the two men, and to the rabbits which hop lazily through his demonstrations. Lan Xichen approves entirely. Even if his heart breaks for the poor orphan who still calls Wangji  baba  and Wei Wuxian  a-die, the scene is rather idyllic. It is so wonderful for children to have fresh air. Lan Xichen often walks past and sees them sharing a cold lunch, devising little games with A-Yuan, or playing music together.\u00a0\nThe music that Wangji has written as of late is a great deal more emotionally dynamic than his past work. Recurring songs include two he has titled \u201cLonging Fulfilled\u201d and \u201cFamily United.\u201d It really is amazing that he is growing as a composer. Lan Xichen hopes that this is a sign that he will grow into his own emotionally in the coming years.\u00a0\n(Sooner rather than later, Lan Xichen hopes. After all, at some point, everyone of Wangji's age will be married off. If he stays unattached and disinterested for another two decades, will Lan Xichen have to try to marry his forty year old brother off to a seventeen year old? That will be strange. Ah, If Lan Xichen\u2019s future wife can help Wangji locate a girl with some spirit, it might work out. After all, given Wei Wuxian\u2019s... everything, Wangji clearly likes a spitfire. )\n\u2014\nWangji takes to having the \u201cfamily\u201d over for dinner once a week. That is, he has A-Yuan, the ever-present Wei Wuxian (who, as his shield brother, is technically family), plus Lan Xichen and even, occasionally, Lan Qiren over to the jingshi for dinner. It is a wonderful idea, to eat together in silence instead of apart in silence. Wei Wuxian is always on his best behavior.\nTheir uncle becomes more and more suspicious as the evening progresses and Wei Wuxian fails to scandalize him. But after the meal, A-Yuan\u2019s politely bubbly chatter even softens him.\u00a0\nIt is so nice that Wangji has made their mother\u2019s prison into a home. She would have liked having company. Well, perhaps not Lan Qiren. He suspects that they did not get along. But Lan Xichen thinks that she might have rather liked Wei Wuxian, and his influence on Wangji.\u00a0\nFrom the day Wei Wuxian showed up for lessons, it was obvious that he intrigued Wangji. That Wangji wanted to understand him. To know him. Lan Xichen always encouraged their friendship. It was the first friendship Wangji truly had, he believes. If Wangji is clinging to this relatively young type of arrangement with Wei Wuxian, well, Lan Xichen must admit that he\u2019s still worlds away from where he was, socially speaking, before they took up together.\u00a0\u00a0\nCultivators live for a long time, Lan Xichen often reminds himself. There is no need to rush Wangji\u2019s maturation. Their mother would have wanted him to have friends.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0Lan Wangji and Wei Ying do not always work well together when it comes to quiet tasks. Wei Ying gets distracted by technical tangents and creative projects, and Lan Wangji gets distracted by Wei Ying.\u00a0\nRight now, by Lan Wangji\u2019s side in the library, Wei Ying has chosen a quiet method of self-distraction - sketching. He is always put out that Lan Wangji looks unsurprised to see his finished product, but it is very obvious when Wei Ying is drawing instead of writing. His hands take on a different manner of elegance. His wrists turn in clever arcs.\u00a0\nLan Wangji realizes that he has been neglecting his own work just as Wei Ying looks up and meets his eye. A knowing exchange of glances. They should both be working, but they can take a few moments to breathe.\u00a0\n\u2014\nIn the library one day, Lan Xichen happens upon Wei Wuxian and Wangji doing research. Wei Wuxian is diligently working on some of his more arcane talisman designs; Wangji is studying a set of obscure spiritual songs for the qin.\u00a0\nTwo hours later, he returns for different texts. He could (should, probably) simply request them from a disciple, but he finds he has more success looking at the wide swath of their collection and finding what might be relevant to the topic of the day.\u00a0\nWangji is still studying. Wei Wuxian is - at first Lan Xichen thinks he is drafting a talisman, but when he walks behind him, he sees that he is drawing quite a beautiful portrait of Lan Xichen\u2019s brother.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, that is wonderful,\u201d Lan Xichen says.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Wei Wuxian replies. \u201cIt\u2019s because Lan Zhan is such an inspiring model.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Xichen agrees, already thinking about how this skill could be put to use. Wei Wuxian already conducts night hunts, invents talismans and arrays, and mentors the juniors, so Lan Xichen must admit that his brother\u2019s sworn shield pulls his weight around the Cloud Recesses. But perhaps he can convince him to cover just a few fine arts classes, if need should arise.\n\u2014\nDuring the year of confusion that follows the close of the Sunshot Campaign, Jin Guangyao kills his own father, confesses his crime to Nie Mingjue, and gets murdered. By Nie Mingjue. It isn\u2019t too hard for Nie Mingjue - well, Nie Mingjue\u2019s little brother - to find a witness to Jin Guangshan\u2019s murder after the fact.\u00a0\nLan Xichen is crushed but, frankly, Nie Mingjue had had a bad feeling about that little dude for a while. He goes home to Qinghe with a light conscience and gets married (Married! To a real, live woman! The Nie sect\u2019s most accomplished general, no less!) the following month. She can sharpen a blade to the finest point he\u2019s ever seen, and she beats him roundly in hand-to-hand combat. Marrying her is the happiest day of Nie Mingjue\u2019s life.\u00a0\n\u2014\nOne scant year after Wangji and Wei Wuxian return to the Cloud Recesses, the world loses Jin Guangyao. At Nie Mingjue\u2019s own hand, nonetheless. Lan Xichen is bereaved, but he carries on: as his uncle always reminds him, he is sect leader now.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cFour, please, auntie,\u201d Wei Ying says to the scallion pancake vendor.\u00a0\nTaking Wei Ying to Caiyi Town is one of Lan Wangji\u2019s greatest simple pleasures.\u00a0\nWei Ying\u2019s casual revelation, towards the end of the war, that he used to be - his words - a \u201cstreet waif\u201d cast certain things in a new light. He delights in good food to such an excessive degree because he went without any reliable source of food for years, and not of his own volition, as Lan Sect disciples do when they are first forming their golden cores. He loves getting ink and brushes and paper because he had none of the three for many years. Nor anyone to whom he might show or send a drawing or a letter. He loves it when Lan Wangji spends money on him because it gives him a sense of security, and because it makes him feel desired.\u00a0\nLan Wangji desires to spoil Wei Ying. In this, as in many things, Wei Ying indulges him with impunity.\n\u2014\nLan Xichen thinks that it is kind of his brother to cover Wei Wuxian\u2019s costs in town without discussion, and even make something of a game of it. After all, the Jiang Sect was thoroughly sacked. Money is probably a sensitive subject for Lotus Pier\u2019s survivors.\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nWhen Lan Zhan puts his hand between Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, Wei Wuxian hardly notices. When he slides it down to his waist, he looks at him but keeps talking. When he puts it flat against the small of Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, it is Wei Wuxian himself who makes the erroneous choice to cant his hips back, encouraging Lan Zhan\u2019s hand down to his ass.\u00a0\nHe knows he has a solid, appealing rear end. He knows that Lan Zhan likes grabbing it. He likes when Lan Zhan grabs it.\u00a0\nHe likes it just as much when Lan Zhan strokes it slowly. Like he\u2019s doing now. Just measured, soothing caresses, punctuated with the occasional pinch.\u00a0\n\u201cLan er-gege,\u201d he admonishes after a particularly hard pinch, slapping his husband\u2019s chest playfully. He doesn\u2019t try to get away from his hand in the slightest.\u00a0\n\u2014\nFrom a distance, it looks to Lan Xichen like Wangji is vigorously patting his sworn shield\u2019s rear end. Wei Wuxian must have sat in something. For all that black hides stains better than Lan white, Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes  are often a bit disheveled.\n\u2014\nThe pain of Meng Yao\u2019s death lessens as the months go by. Lan Xichen begins to think upon marriage, as he had always planned to do following the war. Especially after he befriends the gentle, clearheaded Qin Su, Meng Yao\u2019s former intended.\u00a0\nOne day, Lan Xichen and Wangji are discussing the potential volatility of Lan Yi\u2019s cave - whether it would fare better left open or sealed. Wangji brings Wei Wuxian to weigh in, as he also met Lan Yi. They are just getting to a productive point in the discussion when Lan Xichen is interrupted by a herald determined to deliver a marriage inquiry directly to the sect leader.\u00a0\nLan Xichen blanches. He is excited about possibly marrying within the year, but this is most indecorous. Especially in front of Wei Wuxian, who is not family. He is not even a distant Lan.\nWei Wuxian says to Wangji softly, with the air of an older man recalling a lovely festival day from his childhood, \u201cAh, everyone thought Jiang Yanli would get married first because she\u2019s the oldest, but then I was married by the time I got back from the Cloud Recesses.\u201d\nWangji blinks fondly back at him, saying nothing.\u00a0\nLan Xichen has never heard this before. Wei Wuxian married mysteriously on the journey from Cloud Recesses to Lotus Pier? A whirlwind romance with a woman he met in a town somewhere? It seems like the kind of impulsive move that the son of a servant is able to make.\u00a0\nThe revelation recasts Wei Wuxian\u2019s determination to cling to Wangji in a new light. He should have been able to go back home to his wife after the war. If his wife is gone, Lan Xichen understands how painful it would have been to settle into a lonely life without her. No wonder he did not return to Yunmeng.\u00a0\nThe Lan sect sees mourning as a noble pursuit. Lan Xichen is glad that Wei Wuxian could take solace in the Cloud Recesses. In his shield brother\u2019s arms. How very warrior-poet of them.\u00a0\n\u2014\nNow, learning that Wei Wuxian is a mourning widower does complicate Lan Xichen\u2019s understanding of A-Yuan\u2019s parentage. If Wei Wuxian was married, and A-Yuan is his child, then A-Yuan\u2019s mother must be Wei Wuxian\u2019s deceased wife, correct? Although... hm. A-Yuan looks so much like Wangji. Is he\u2026 Wei Wuxian\u2019s deceased wife\u2019s child  by Wangji? He doesn\u2019t think Wangji would sleep with his best friend\u2019s wife. But it would explain their strange arrangement.\u00a0\nLan Xichen may have to content himself with never understanding. In any case, it is so kind of his brother to see his shield brother through the pain of losing the most important person in his life. There are worse methods of coping with such a loss than moving to the Cloud Recesses. (See: their father, whose response was to never again move  out of his small, secluded cottage in the Cloud Recesses.)\n\u2014\nLan Wangji strikes out at Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder. It unbalances him, but he is on his feet again in a moment; he advances and, in three quick motions, brings the very point of his sword underneath Lan Wangji\u2019s chin. They stand completely still for a moment, gazes locked.\u00a0\nThen Lan Wangji twists and reverses their positions. Bichen\u2019s blade points at Wei Ying\u2019s throat.\u00a0\nWei Ying says sofly, seductively, \u201cI might let you.\u201d As though talking about something else.\u00a0\nLan Wangji does not move. Does not speak.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind nearly so much, as long as it was you,\u201d Wei Ying continues.\u00a0\nLan Wangji tosses Bichen to the ground carelessly and takes his husband by the shoulders. Wei Ying grasps one of his wrists and turns them around, locking Lan Wangji\u2019s arm behind him.\u00a0\n\u201cDear husband,\u201d he says in Lan Wangji\u2019s ear. \u201cHave you tired of sparring with your wife so soon? Don\u2019t you want to see if you can tire me out with your sword?\u201d\nHe sets Lan Wangji up like this sometimes. \u201cI can tire you out with another sword,\u201d he growls.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try,\u201d Wei Ying whispers.\u00a0\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and hooks Wei Ying\u2019s ankle, throwing them both to the ground of the practice arena.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cSect Leader,\u201d Lan Qiangda, the Lan sect\u2019s main swordwork instructor, says, bowing deeply.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Qiangda,\u201d Lan Xichen greets. \u201cWhy have you come to see me today?\u201d\nLan Xichen is currently holding open hours for anyone who might wish to air grievances. As the Lan sect prides itself on discretion and self-governance, few attend these hours. They give Lan Xichen the chance to catch up on correspondence.\u00a0\nLan Qiangda\u2019s father was also the Lan sect\u2019s main swordwork instructor, and his father\u2019s mother before him. He is generally an easygoing fellow, self-disciplined and not prone to interpersonal conflict.\u00a0\nHe usually has the typically serene air of a Lan elder, but something about his countenance right now is almost apologetic. \u201cI have come to ask that Hanguang-Jun and Wei Wuxian be stopped from sparring so\u2026 heatedly\u2026 while the rest of the disciples are training,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nOh. Wangji and Wei Wuxian are fairly powerful. And they learned a different kind of fighting during the war; everyone did. Fighting not to win but to kill.\u00a0\nThe youngest disciples have not seen real combat. Lan Xichen hopes it stays that way.\u00a0\n\u201cThat must be upsetting for the younger disciples to see,\u201d he agrees. \u201cI will speak to them.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Lan Qiangda says fervently, bowing very deeply before leaving the room. Very upsetting for the youngest disciples indeed.\u00a0\n\u2014\nQin Su falls in love with Lan Xichen because he is utterly guileless.\u00a0\nAfter Jin Guangyao - her clever, ambitious intended husband, Jin Guangyao - is killed, she comes to understand her true relationship to him, and that he must have known about it. She is horrified. She is disgusted. She is feeling very  over the cunning upstart type.\u00a0\nLan Xichen expresses condolences during Jin Guangyao\u2019s rites. (She carries them out not out of respect for the man himself but because she does not want to be haunted by her incestuous half-brother\u2019s ghost.)\n\u201cPoor man. He was so troubled,\u201d Lan Xichen says sadly.\u00a0\nShe is alight with frustration for a moment. Then she snuffs it out. This man does not know about Jin Guangyao\u2019s blood relationship with Qin Su. She did not announce it. Spared herself - her mother - that shame.\u00a0\nIn place of the anger is curiosity. Few people have said nice things about Jin Guangyao over the last few days, all very happy to have a new person to blame for their troubles in the vacuum left by Wen Ruohan. \u201cYes,\u201d she says softly, acknowledging without really agreeing.\u00a0\n\u201cHe must have struggled,\u201d Lan Xichen continues sadly. \u201cTo confess to Nie Mingjue. He must have been - I still cannot believe that he always meant to do harm.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is that, Zewu Jun?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I believe it?\u201d\nShe nods.\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Lan Xichen says. He looks lost. \u201cI suppose - I have never wanted to\u2026 do what he did. To hurt or deceive anyone like that. He was a good man, at heart. The Meng Yao I knew wouldn\u2019t have done these things.\u201d\nOh. She gets it. His reputation is spotless, after all. He is inclined to honesty, and loyalty, and keeping his word, and so he thinks - rather stupidly - that everyone else must be just the same way, deep down. Must be just like him.\nQin Su is rather attracted to guilelessness, as it turns out. And Lan Xichen\u2019s handsome face doesn\u2019t hurt.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Xichen does, eventually, get married.\u00a0\nHe and Qin Su bonded over their mutual loss of poor, troubled Jin Guangyao, who had been courting her at the time of his death. When the inquiry from the Qin family arrives, about a year later, Lan Xichen is amenable. The Lan Clan does need to strengthen its ties with the Lanling-area clans. Especially given that Lan Xichen\u2019s brother\u2019s sworn shield is still sticking around, making it difficult for Yunmeng Jiang to take offense at Lan Xichen\u2019s choice to build bridges between the Lan Clan and a minor Lanling-area clan.\u00a0\nPolitical concerns aside, Qin Su is careful and kind and beautiful. Lan Xichen had expected to feel generally indifferent to his marriage at the start, being that it was always going to be a practical match. But he is so happy, truly, to marry her.\u00a0\n\u2014\nAlso, on a more crass note, Lan Xichen is thrilled to learn that real sexual relations are every bit as satisfying as they are purported to be. It\u2019s  warm in there. Incredible stuff.\u00a0\nStrangely, being initiated into the art of lovemaking makes him feel more charitably towards Wei Wuxian. He feels bad for him. Wei Wuxian once knew the miraculous touch of a woman, and then he had to regress to awkward tent handjobs on the warfront. Awful. How kind of him to indulge Wangji\u2019s youthful appetites.\n\u2014\nLan Wangji and Wei Ying usually do not fuck in the cold springs. They have, mostly to prove to themselves that they could. But fucking in a bed - or any room-temperature environment - is far preferable.\u00a0\nThat said, on hot summer days like this one, they do like to bathe together in the cool, refreshing waters.\u00a0\nLan Wangji carefully directs Wei Ying to lean back into the stream. As he floats slightly, Lan Wangji combs through his hair.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan, let\u2019s live in the cold springs,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cAnd then you could do this forever.\u201d\n\u201cI can do this at home,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him. \u201cI do this most mornings, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Wei Ying agrees. \u201cSo good at it. Handsome husband. You\u2019ll pull up if I fall asleep, right?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan promises. Given that he bathes a sleeping Wei Ying many mornings, he has at least as much practice in checking that he is not underwater as he does in combing his hair.\u00a0\n\u2014\nAfter their wedding, Lan Xichen and Qin Su are given a few days of seclusion in order to get to know one another intimately. It is his understanding that this practice was set into place after an unfortunate incident wherein a newly-married Lan sect couple, having exchanged their ribbons, lost hold of their self-discipline entirely and scorned their duties, instead running off to an inn in Jinlintai for several weeks in order to, ah, learn one another. The elders were outraged, but also thought that it was a rather wise idea, and instituted a week of marital leave as policy.\u00a0\nThus, he finds himself unoccupied and rather sticky in the middle of the afternoon on one of the hottest days of the summer. He carefully extricates himself from their marriage bed - Qin Su snores a bit, which is extremely cute - and goes to dip into the cold springs. Upon arriving, he sees that his brother is already there, intently focused on\u2026 giving Wei Wuxian a bath? Just genially, publicly washing Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair? And - is that a comb?\nWei Wuxian cannot possibly still be injured from the night hunt two months ago that took a chunk from his shoulder. Can he be?\u00a0\nLan Xichen resolves to ask them both privately if they might wish to take some time off of their night hunting duties, or lessen their frequency, so as to allow for optimal recovery. Then he selects a spot a bit downstream from them for bathing; it seems rather rude to rinse off the aforementioned stickiness directly onto others.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWei Wuxian\u2019s unexpected arrival at Qin Su\u2019s doorstop unnerves her. Lan Xichen is off attending to sect matters, and she is alone in the hanshi catching up on piles of correspondence. This is their first day out of seclusion as a couple.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian may be a war hero, but he has a reputation for dabbling in the forbidden arts, and she does not know him at all. Hanguang-Jun is supposed to meet her and her husband at the hanshi for dinner; why is this other man at her new home hours beforehand? Did she forget about drop-in meet-and-greet hours for the sect leader\u2019s wife?\nInteracting as a married woman is new and fraught. She does not want to offend anyone. But she will not be intimidated in her own home.\u00a0\nShe throws back her shoulders before she opens the door. Wei Wuxian attended her wedding. She thinks that he may have been in attendance as her new husband\u2019s extremely intimidating brother\u2019s\u2026 companion. She can give him a chance to explain himself.\u00a0\n\u201cMadam Qin! Hi!\u201d Wei Wuxian says when she opens it. He bows politely from a distance. She doesn\u2019t look around in confusion when he greets her as Madam Qin, which is a small, private victory.\u00a0\nSo. An honored, intimidating war hero of slightly dubious reputation is here. At the door of her new home. Where she now lives.\u00a0\n\u201cI just wanted to welcome you to the Cloud Recesses! You know, say hi and ask if you need any help setting up for dinner or anything! I\u2019m so excited to have another non-Lan in the family,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nHuh.\n\u201cOh, here,\u201d he continues. He hands over a beautifully wrapped box. \u201cI would never trade being married to Lan Zhan for anything, but the Lans do  not know how to spice their food -\u201d\nOh. Oh!\n\u201c- so I brought you, ah, some of the very hot southern peppers - that\u2019ll be the red jar, careful when you open it if you\u2019re not used to them - and also star anise, and a few others. I\u2019ve found a pretty good spice seller in Caiyi Town, and I usually stop in town on my way back from hunts, so I can pick up others for you if you ever need. Or whatever else, really.\u201d\nHe cuts a rather domestic figure when brandishing cooking sundries rather than a sword.\n\u201cI - won\u2019t you come in?\u201d Qin Su asks.\u00a0\n\u2014\nHanguang-Jun himself appears after an only moderately awkward tea-taking. He apologizes for having been caught up in his correspondence. (She\u2019s gathered, at this point, that Lan Xichen forgot to tell her that the two of them would be stopping by today. She will discuss that with him later. Her mother told her all about laying down the law with her husband before he gets ideas.)\nHanguang-Jun and his husband are obviously very in love. They take turns lovingly gazing at one another and gushing about their son.\u00a0\n\u201cA-Yuan is perfect, Qin Su,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He expounds on this point for several minutes, listing everything from A-Yuan\u2019s age-appropriate reading skills to his quietude and diligence to his \u201cvery cute little toes.\u201d\u00a0\nAt the end of this spiel, Hanguang-Jun adds, \u201cHe is\u2026 a polite boy.\u201d\u00a0\nNever has Qin Su heard a Lan be so effusive in their praise.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWhen they leave, she closes the hanshi\u2019s door behind them and leans against it momentarily.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, thank heavens,\u201d she says to herself.\u00a0\nAs Qin Su is the wife of the sect leader, helping to find a wife for Lan Wangji is under her purview. Her husband has spoken about Lan Wangji a few times. About how he hopes that his little brother lets go of youthful things and embraces marital bliss as Lan Xichen himself has. (\u201cEmbraces marital bliss\u201d is his wording. He is a ridiculous, dear man.) It\u2019s stressful to be tasked with finding a suitable wife for an incredibly stoic man belonging to a notoriously strict and upright clan. Qin Su only just finished finding herself a husband, and her first choice turned out to be  her own brother. Her track record isn\u2019t great.\u00a0\nBut! It turns out that her brother-in-law is already married! Goodness, Qin Su really dodged an arrow there.\u00a0\nShe is a little concerned that her new husband apparently to some degree disapproves of those who cut their sleeve. Ah, well. No new husband is perfect (another one of her mother\u2019s helpful teachings), and Hanguang-Jun and Wei Wuxian seem to be handling things just fine.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWei Wuxian surfaces slightly from sleep for just an instant to the sensation of his very perfect husband breaching him with the tip of one spit-slick finger.\u00a0\nHe falls asleep again without even noticing. Dreams that his husband is fucking him. He\u2019s sleeping on his stomach in their bed in the jingshi, one leg pulled up to the side, but in the dream he\u2019s on his knees. Wakes again, slightly, only enough to recognize that the dream and the real world are two different places. His husband slides the whole finger inside of him. Wei Wuxian falls back asleep as Lan Zhan fucks him gently.\nHe dreams about Lan Zhan some more, and somewhere along the line, the dream becomes very specifically about Lan Zhan fucking him in their bed. With three fingers. Wei Wuxian just breathing. Deep. Calm. Wanting more so badly but unable to do anything about it. Wanting more but just hanging out and waiting to see what he\u2019s being given. Wanting, wanting -\u00a0\nHe wakes up for almost-real for a split second when his husband lifts Wei Wuxian\u2019s leg at the knee and shoves his cock inside of him in one smooth motion.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian groans loudly, emphatically, the sound pushed out of him with no grace or charm.\u00a0\nLan Zhan chuckles over him, over his body, which is still sleep-weak. No one believes him when he says Lan Zhan can chuckle.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian intends to say something, but falls back to sleep instead.\u00a0\nThere are two more times when he wakes up with a sense of need, wanting but too useless to chase it for himself.\u00a0\nHe manages one pathetic whine.\u00a0\nLan Zhan doesn\u2019t chuckle, this time. He speeds up. Gets deeper into Wei Wuxian. He feels so good there, so right, that Wei Wuxian - oh. Whoops. He distantly recognizes that he\u2019s dreaming again. He should probably wake up. They were right about to get to the good part. They -\u00a0\nHe wakes up already spilling over Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers. His whole body feels confused, like it should have coiled up tightly, anticipatory, but he didn\u2019t have the time. He\u2019s just lax and loose. Fuck, gods, gods. He can\u2019t make words. He can\u2019t even whine. Lan Zhan\u2019s fine with that, though. As he drifts off again, Wei Wuxian is pretty sure that Lan Zhan is coming.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Xichen does convince Wei Wuxian to cover an art class for a cohort of younger disciples. He is thrilled to hear that it goes well. It makes sense that Wei Wuxian is good with children. After all, he is raising one (his? someone\u2019s?) right here in the Cloud Recesses.\u00a0\nIt is a wonder he has the energy, though. During the war, Lan Xichen saw Wei Wuxian sleeping in tent corners, collapsed over piles of talismans, all the time.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian\u2019s sleeping habits are positively Lan-like, really; he appears to simply knock out wherever and whenever he is feeling tired. But whereas the Lan fall asleep at a set hour regardless of their location, Wei Wuxian lacks a predictable bedtime. Occasionally, Lan Xichen spots him napping at midday in trees and in his small office attached to the archives.\u00a0\nLan Xichen can reasonably assume that the man sleeps in the guest dorms from time to time, but he does not have a dedicated set of rooms now, as most adults in the Cloud Recesses do. Presumably, as Wei Wuxian\u2019s host, Wangji must throw a blanket over Wei Wuxian wherever he passes out, because it\u2019s not as though Wei Wuxian is a member of the clan who keeps to the hours.\nActually, if either of them are anything like Lan Xichen, they fall asleep after the act - whether it is true lovemaking or an exchange of dry handjobs whilst envisioning one\u2019s best guess at the naked female form. (Lan Xichen shudders to recall that Wei Wuxian once knew the touch of a woman, and now is back to just imagining them very hard while trying to pretend that his sworn brother\u2019s hand is not attached to, well, his sworn brother.) So Wei Wuxian likely sleeps on the floor of the jingshi, or possibly even Wangji\u2019s bed, from time to time. That sounds uncomfortable. Perhaps failing to dedicate rooms to Wei Wuxian has been an inhospitable move on the part of the Lan sect, and of Wangji, specifically. Lan Xichen wonders if that should be rectified.\u00a0\n\u201cShould I send a second bed to the jingshi? So that Wei Wuxian has a dedicated sleeping space?\u201d he asks Qin Su one evening, walking back to the hanshi after a family dinner with Wangji, A-Yuan, Wei Wuxian, and Lan Qiren.\u00a0\nHer eyebrows furrow in charming disapproval. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, uncharacteristically crisp. Huh.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWei Wuxian and Lan Zhan play a rambling duet by the waterfall they think of as theirs, for no reason other than that they both like it in particular. Its waters are not terribly loud, and the acoustics of the surrounding rock are incredible.\u00a0\nWhile they\u2019re both lost in music, the golden afternoon light fades into dusk.\nFeeling the slightly cooler cast to the air, Wei Wuxian looks up. His husband - oh. His husband.\u00a0\nHe brings his part of their song to a close and sets his dizi aside carefully. Lan Zhan follows suit.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe and Lan Zhan and A-Yuan often come here as a family, but today he and his husband are alone. Their son is in class, learning calligraphy. Sucker.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, tugging on Lan Zhan\u2019s sleeve.\u00a0\nLan Zhan moves to sit closer to him and, without needing to ask, leans down and kisses him. It\u2019s slow, wet, deep. Lewd, for the setting. Lewd in general. Very sexy.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian breaks away to say, \u201cLan er-gege,\u201d and then pulls him back in for another one.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Xichen is meditating higher up in the Cloud Recesses\u2019 waterfalls. He can hear the music that his brother and his brother\u2019s sworn shield are playing. He can also hear when it stops. He looks down absently, thoughtlessly breaking his concentration, and startles to see Wei Wuxian and Wangji - ah, there is no polite term for  making out, with visible tongues.  With, apparently, a side of  biting one another\u2019s\u2019 throats.\u00a0 \nThat is - a bit more amorous than anything that Lan Xichen did with his own shield brother, but - ah, well, the natural beauty of the Cloud Recesses in the springtime is so powerfully inspiring! And perhaps it is easier for them to imagine a woman if they cannot hear one another over the rushing of the falls?\u00a0\nHis brother deserves to enjoy what frivolous youth he can recapture from before the war. If the two of them have found a way to pretend that one another's' mouths are the beautiful, soft lips of a lady, then more power to them, Lan Xichen supposes.\u00a0\nHe hurriedly stands and goes to meditate elsewhere.\u00a0\n\u2014\nWei Wuxian\u2019s wrists have been tied with Lan Zhan\u2019s ribbon for what feels like hours.\u00a0\nHe blew him just long enough to get Wei Wuxian hot and bothered. Aching for something in his ass. Aching for him.\u00a0\nThen Lan Zhan shoved into him all at once, way too harshly, exactly like Wei Wuxian likes it.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, Lan Zhan, Hanguang-Jun, Lan er-gege,\u201d he babbles. \u201cHave mercy, you\u2019re going to tear me up, I\u2019ll die, I\u2019ll - I -\u201d\n\u201cYou will live,\u201d Lan Zhan instructs. He takes Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock in hand.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian keens. He pushes his hips up into Lan Zhan. Fuck his fist and impales himself on his husband\u2019s perfect cock.\u00a0\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d he demands. \u201cNo, kiss my neck. Make sure it shows, okay?\u201d\nLan Zhan bites the tender skin under Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear and asks - rhetorically - \u201cWhy is that, pretty wife?\u201d\n\u201cMakes me feel like everyone knows I\u2019m yours,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him. \u201cDear husband,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, and sucks harder at Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian\u2019s wrists strain against the ribbon, but its spiritual power holds him fast. It bites into him when he struggles, painful, almost like carpet burn.\u00a0\nHe loves it. He wants Lan Zhan to keep him tied up for the rest of their lives.\u00a0\n\u2014\nQuite honestly, Lan Xichen is a bit confused by just how  much  necking appears to be involved in Wangji and Wei Wuxian  biding time with one another. If the occasional shadows (or outright hickies) on their throats and jaws are any indication, they do so rather often.\u00a0\n(To be fair to them, there is a bit of a trick to spiritually healing up hickies, as they are not serious enough ailments for one\u2019s golden core to automatically intervene. A few days into their marital seclusion, Lan Xichen and Qin Su awoke to find themselves quite bruised about their throats (and several other places besides). After their sheepish laughter wore off - they kept telling one another not to look, and then kept breaking the seriousness of it by giggling - they mutually decided it was below their dignity as a married couple to flash said bruises about. They lost a full afternoon attempting to heal them before getting it quite right.)\nWangji and Wei Wuxian seem to have taken a more... lackadaisical approach. They bear the blemishes of amorous, carefree youth unselfconsciously. Or, seemingly so - one time Lan Xichen tried to show Wangji how to heal them.\u00a0\nLan Xichen\u2019s attempts to demonstrate the healing technique to Wangji have been met with horrified mortification. If he is honest, this is at least part of why he has offered to teach it to Wangji so many times. Wangji is usually unflappable; Lan Xichen seizes rare opportunities to get a rise out of him as they come.\nAnyway. Yes. Necking with one\u2019s shield brother is... odd. But hey, who is to say that Lan Xichen wouldn\u2019t have tried it out if his arrangement with Nie Mingjue had extended past the war? Granted, he had not  wanted to neck with Nie Mingjue, but perhaps he would have been motivated to do so if he were feeling concerned about his performance in marriage.\u00a0\nHe had not, actually, known at the time that there were performance standards by which kissing could be judged. It worked out just fine, though. He happily remembers the week or so wherein Qin Su painstakingly explained that there was technique to kissing, and then taught it to him. There had been\u2026 much room for improvement in his performance at the beginning of his marriage, it turned out.\u00a0\nAh, Wangji and Wei Wuxian are still so inexperienced, never having known the touch of a woman. Or - Wei Wuxian was married before, wasn\u2019t he? But that was some time ago, regardless. It is probably a good sign that they are practicing so diligently for their own marriages, then! Perhaps, in addition to Wangji turning his thoughts toward matrimony,\u00a0 Wei Wuxian will be moved to find love again one day.\u00a0\n(Regarding marks other than hickies, Wei Wuxian also often has bruises or red marks on his wrists. Lan Xichen knows that these ones, at least, are the result of intense sparring: Wei Wuxian sometimes pouts at Wangji and tells him that he must rub salve into them in penance for putting them there in the first place.)\n\u2014\nWei Ying drags Lan Wangji and A-Yuan out into town to take in the celebration of a minor festival. (He calls it dragging, at least, though both Lan Wangji and A-Yuan go quite willingly.) On their way back, A-Yuan insists on practicing sword forms. Lan Wangji indulges A-Yuan for some time, and finds his brother keeping Wei Wuxian company under the nearest tree afterwards. They return to the Cloud Recesses together, walking largely to set a good example for A-Yuan regarding frivolous use of spiritual energy.\u00a0\n\u201cA-Yuan\u2019s getting so big! He\u2019s so good at that third turn movement now,\u201d Wei Ying says fondly that evening.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. \u201cHis endurance has improved as well. How long were you and Xichen waiting?\u201d\n\u201cOh, a while, but it was no trouble. We just... chatted.\u201d His voice is strange. Falsely casual.\u00a0\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Wangji asks.\n\u201cJust\u2026 stuff,\u201d Wei Ying says coyly. \u201cFamily stuff, you know. I think he might be finally kind of getting it.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says skeptically.\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wei Ying says, laughing a little.\u00a0\n\u201cIf this worries you -\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, who cares,\u201d Wei Ying sighs breezily. \u201cI don\u2019t need your brother to understand. You\u2019re the only Twin Jade that matters to me. You\u2019re a great husband. And\u2026 a great father.\u201d\nLan Wangji strokes Wei Ying\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\u201cLike. Such a good father,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cYou like it, right? Being a father?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Wangji says, concerned.\u00a0\nWith a secretive smile, Wei Ying says, \u201cGood. Me too.\u201d\n\u2014\nJust outside of Caiyi Town, Lan Xichen runs into Wei Wuxian. There is a small festival in town today; Wei Wuxian has candy. Some distance away, Wangji patiently goes through sword forms with A-Yuan, who has recently taken to insisting on practicing them anywhere, any time, without a moment\u2019s notice.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he great?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks when Wangji carefully repositions A-Yuan\u2019s elbow.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Xichen says. \u201cI look forward to seeing him with a large family one day.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen. He stares at Wangji for another moment and stops biting his candy mid-nibble.\u00a0\nPulling it out of his mouth, he turns to face Lan Xichen and asks, \u201cDid - um, did Lan Zhan say he wants more kids?\u201d\nOh, dear. \u201cWe have not discussed it. I assume he does. Would that be a problem?\u201d Lan Xichen asks, taking in Wei Wuxian\u2019s wide-eyed stare back towards Wangji and A-Yuan. A-Yuan will always be a Lan. Will always be Wangji\u2019s son. Lan Xichen hopes that the idea of Wangji growing up - marrying and adding to his family - does not incite misplaced jealousy, for either A-Yuan or Wei Wuxian.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, to Lan Xichen\u2019s relief. \u201cNo, I mean, I should probably talk to him about it, but not - not at all. No, I love kids.\u201d His voice is high.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lan Xichen says, pleased.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd, I mean, I don\u2019t really know how that would happen, but - no, not a problem at all.\u201d He sounds happy.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Lan Xichen says vaguely, somewhat shocked by Wei Wuxian\u2019s boldness, but also gratified: Lan Xichen, too, finds the - the arcane processes behind conception rather opaque.\u00a0\u00a0\nTroublemaker though he may be, Wei Wuxian might be the best shield brother Wangji could possibly have found. He is terribly gracious and understanding of Wangji\u2019s immaturity. What grace, to look forward to his shield brother\u2019s future marriage despite his own ending in tragedy. To support Wangji in finding his own wedded bliss, as Lan Xichen himself has, as Wei Wuxian once did.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Wangji and Wei Ying go to the hot springs together. The crisp fall air makes the waters steam, painting everything in a haze. Normally, they only watch one another here. Perhaps kiss a bit. But Wei Ying bends over, and Lan Wangji reaches out to grab his ass without conscious thought. Sinks his fingers in. Decides that he absolutely must sink other things in.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says. He shivers when Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth ghosts over the back of his neck. \u201cHere?\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Ying obligingly spreads his legs. He is always willing. It astonishes Lan Wangji, the way that Wei Ying is always willing.\n\u201cSo improper, where anyone could see,\u201d Wei Ying says coyly.\u00a0\nLan Wangji does not bite at the possibility of being caught. Right now, that is not his focus. His focus is on the cool air, and the comparatively blistering warmth of the springs. The even greater heat inside of Wei Ying, at the heart of him, where Lan Wangji wants to be -\u00a0\nWhere he is -\u00a0\nWhere he finishes.\u00a0\n\u201cLan er-gege,\u201d Wei Ying says when they are both satisfied. \u201cSo good to me, my sweet husband.\u201d\nLan Wangji hums, satisfied, slipping two fingers back into him just because he can.\n\u2014\nAs the weather turns again, Lan Xichen begins dipping into the secret, Lan clan member-only hot springs in the evening.\u00a0\nOne day as he approaches, he is surprised to hear Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice ringing out in the distance, words indistinct, tone conversational. What is Wei Wuxian doing in the hot springs? How did he get in? Lan Xichen frowns. The hot springs\u2019 wards are only supposed to permit entry to immediate Lan family members. (There was an incident, before his uncle\u2019s time, with a group of visiting disciples.) And these springs are quite small, compared to the cold springs; they cannot fit many bathers.\u00a0\nThen he hears a low, quiet voice murmur to Wei Wuxian in response. Ah, that explains it: Wangji brought him.  Mystery solved, Lan Xichen thinks to himself, satisfied that nothing untoward is going on. He heads away to the hanshi. He will return when the hot springs are unoccupied.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers from down on his knees, looking up at Lan Zhan, who\u2019s leaning against a tree.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re in the forest. Camping out for one more evening following a successful night hunt. They could have flown home, but why hurry? A-Yuan is safe in the dorms for the night. It\u2019s nice to be alone together in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\u00a0\n\u201cMy dear husband, you made promises to me when we married,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cYou said every day we would - you know. Will you fail me now? Just because we\u2019re outside where anyone could see? No one\u2019s here.\u201d\nBut someone could come across them. These aren\u2019t private lands, and neither Wei Wuxian nor Lan Zhan bothered to set up any wards tonight. (Yet. They will. Wei Wuxian is sort of paranoid about getting caught off-guard and just never coming back from a night hunt, leaving A-Yuan alone. Who could say what that\u2019s about?)\nLan Zhan gently puts a hand to the side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cI will never fail you,\u201d he says, too intense, too good.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian swallows. He leans forward, nuzzling Lan Zhan\u2019s robes. Nuzzling what\u2019s underneath. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whines. Then he whispers, \u201cGet it out?\u201d\nLan Zhan possibly smirks as he does. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t get to watch his face and find out; he\u2019s much too busy taking in the sight of Lan Zhan leaning back to untie his belt, part his robes, and pull his trousers down beneath his balls. His body language is so cocky when he does it, confident. His cock is thick already. Well, it\u2019s thick in any situation, but it\u2019s thickened right now, starting to stand to attention at the sight of Wei Wuxian on his knees. At the knowledge that they could, technically, be happened upon at any moment.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian waits patiently until Lan Zhan taps the head of his cock against his lips, and then he surges up, taking it in both hands, running his tongue along the length. He makes sure to stick his tongue out and look up at Lan Zhan from under his lashes.\u00a0\nLan Zhan\u2019s eyes are heavy-lidded, smoldering. He lets it go on for a long time, content to watch Wei Wuxian put on a show, before saying, \u201cGo on.\u201d\nThat\u2019s all the warning Wei Wuxian gets before Lan Zhan is taking his hair and pushing his head down onto his cock. Wei Wuxian moans, sucking him down.\u00a0\nTaking Lan Zhan in his mouth has a way of shutting out the rest of the world. Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t notice if they were caught now. He might not care, either; it would be pretty hot, under the right circumstances, at least theoretically.\u00a0\nLan Zhan takes him and uses his mouth. Wei Wuxian can moan as much as he wants, but he doesn\u2019t have to speak right now. Lan Zhan\u2019s cock is thick and heavy on his tongue, keeping his mouth open, forcing his throat to relax. Lan Zhan takes care of everything; Wei Wuxian can just stay on his knees and get fucked.\u00a0\nRight around the time that Wei Wuxian starts to press a hand against his own cock in earnest, Lan Zhan pulls away.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian makes a sad sound. Tries to chase him. But Lan Zhan holds him back with a strong hand clamped down on the juncture between his shoulder and neck.\u00a0\n\u201cLike this,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and begins to fist his cock in front of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Lan er-gege,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, faking wide-eyed innocence while he takes out his own cock and begins stroking it. \u201cAre you going to get your come all over me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan growls.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shivers. \u201cWhy\u2019s that, my dear husband? You want to see me like that?\u201d He licks his lips.\u00a0\nLan Zhan, watching him, says, \u201cI wish to see you like that. And if some traveler happens upon us, I wish for them to see you... like this.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps. \u201cYou mean you want them to see me on my knees? Touching myself, waiting for you to -\u201d\n\u201cTo ruin you,\u201d Lan Zhan says, voice incongruously soft, almost kind.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian whines and strokes himself faster. \u201cLan er-gege, I can\u2019t - I need you to, I need something, can\u2019t without getting fucked -\u201d\nLan Zhan is clearly holding himself off by now, shoulders tense, abs twitching. \u201cThen do,\u201d Lan Zhan growls.\nWei Wuxian gasps and uses his free hand to shove his trousers down to his thighs. Then he switches hands, so the dry one goes around his cock. He buries two fingers into himself with his other hand. Curls them and moans. It hurts a little; it feels amazing. \u201cLan Zhan, please,\u201d he says. \u201cHusband. Lan er-gege. Please.\u201d\nLan Zhan says softly, darkly, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d\nWei Wuxian moans and fucks himself harder. He sticks his tongue out, covering his lower lip. An invitation. He bats his eyelashes at Lan Zhan, and then he closes his eyes and waits.\u00a0\nSoon - very soon - the head of Lan Zhan\u2019s cock hits his tongue and comes against it. Then Lan Zhan must pull back, because the rest lands across Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth and over one cheek. He hears Lan Zhan inhale sharply. Feels his thumb brush the corner of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth. Swiping against what he\u2019s left there. Pushing it onto his still-waiting tongue.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian comes with his eyes still shut, mouth closed around Lan Zhan\u2019s thumb, sucking it.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cA productive night hunt, I assume?\u201d Lan Xichen asks Wei Wuxian and Wangji. They returned from their latest trip this morning.\nThey go night hunting quite often, always together, occasionally with a small party of other disciples. It is very kind of Wangji to be so dedicated to representing the Lan sect in the face of chaos. It frees up Lan Xichen to focus on important sect leader duties - diplomacy and politics. Plus, whenever a particularly challenging sect dignitary is visiting, Wangji absconds with Wei Wuxian, which Lan Xichen is sure has averted some incidents.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd how,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, offering a wink. \u201cI sure got down and dirty, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Wangji hisses. His ears are bright red.\nLan Xichen does know what Wei Wuxian means, unfortunately.\u00a0\nWait.\nIs Wei Wuxian breaking off this arrangement between himself and his sworn brother, Wangji?\u00a0\nBecause if he has re-embraced the touch of a woman following his wife\u2019s tragic passing\u2026 what is he still doing here, keeping his brother from moving forward with his life?\nHe waits politely, but Wei Wuxian does not announce an engagement. Nor does Wangji tell Lan Xichen that he is finally open to making marriage inquiries.\u00a0\nOdd.\nOh - perhaps his brother\u2019s ears are red from embarrassment, not anger\u2026 because Wei Wuxian is also revealing an indiscretion on Wangji\u2019s part? Perhaps, utterly sick of sustaining themselves through dry, awkward handjobs by imagining beautiful ladies, both of them partook of a\u2026 certain kind of establishment on their way back from Qinghe, and Wangji does not want Wei Wuxian to tell Lan Xichen about their illicit exploits with women?\nNo, right? No. Lan Xichen knows his brother. His passions run deep. If he paid a visit to a brothel, he would have brought her back to the Cloud Recesses as his wife. If not out of love for her, then out of love for righteousness towards all beings.\u00a0\nStill - he must admit that it would have been terribly amusing, in a horrible, unfilial way, to see Lan Qiren confronted with Wangji following in their father\u2019s footsteps by bringing an inappropriate spouse to the Cloud Recesses with no announcement whatsoever.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Qiren sees Wangji\u2019s relationship with Wei Wuxian quite clearly, thank you very much. When a man returns from war with a spouse and a child in tow, one does not ask questions. One only breathes a sigh of relief that at least a marriage took place.\u00a0\nCan Lan Qiren stand Wei Wuxian? No. Must he stand Wei Wuxian? Yes.\u00a0\nAt least Wangji cannot make quintessentially Lan - meaning: terrible - choices with women if he has shacked up with a man and their baby. Lan Qiren would not have chosen this particular man, had he been consulted, but he decidedly was not. He sees their relationship, and he hates it, but ultimately he makes his peace with - meaning: fully allows - it.\u00a0\nA-Yuan, at least, is a joy. Better behaved than Xichen or Wangji were at that age. And, horribly, it seems that Wei Wuxian is doing a fair job of rearing him. He also, Lan Qiren supposes, does a passable job of teaching their rising disciples. And his performance on night hunts is - it pains Lan Qiren to admit - adequate. Even Wei Wuxian\u2019s contributions to the sect in terms of research and improvements in cultivation technology are\u2026 heavens help him\u2026 acceptable.\u00a0\nWhich is not to say that Wei Wuxian has stopped being incredibly aggravating. But no matter. No matter. Lan Qiren is stepping back and allowing Xichen to take over as sect leader, after all. Wei Wuxian is Xichen\u2019s problem now.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Wangji and Wei Ying sometimes eat dinner with the rest of the cultivators in the main hall. Usually because it is convenient. After a long day of hard work, when they do not feel even like walking all the way back to the jingshi or cooking for themselves, they take their meal with the group. Even now that Wei Ying has established a satisfactory spicing system for Gusu Lan\u2019s more bland offerings, they prefer to spend their time with one another. And with A-Yuan, as often as they can without interfering with his training.\u00a0\nBut tonight, they have only just returned from a week-long hunt. They are both strong cultivators, but returning to a place of stillness makes any journey feel tiring in hindsight. So they eat with the bulk of the Lan disciples.\u00a0\nWei Ying is tired and cranky. Lan Wangji is, though he would never admit as much to Wei Ying, also cranky. Because he is also tired.\u00a0\n\u201cYou wrecked my ass last night,\u201d Wei Ying whines to Lan Wangji when they finish eating. He wiggles his fingers in Lan Wangji\u2019s direction, indicating that he should help him up off the floor.\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. He pulls Wei Ying up when he stands. In a lower voice, he assures him, \u201cI will take responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Wei Ying says sleepily as they leave the main hall. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYou wrecked my ass last night,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines to Wangji at dinner.\u00a0\nThey really do spar so hard, Lan Xichen thinks. He may need to speak with them at some point about forming better habits in peacetime.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, looking into Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying. I love you,\u201d Lan Wangji responds, his lips inches away from Wei Ying\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u201cA word, if you will, Wangji,\u201d Xichen calls, as he lets himself into their home.\u00a0\nFuck.\u00a0\nXichen stops short a few feet from the door of their (locked) private residence and stares, wide-eyed and blank, at Wei Ying and Lan Wangji. At their rather intimate positioning.\u00a0\nWei Ying and Lan Wangji look back at him, waiting to hear what in the world could possibly be so important that he might need to break into their home to discuss it.\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Xichen says. He bows, turns on his heel, and walks right back out.\u00a0\nWei Ying and Lan Wangji exchange a look.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d Wei Ying asks.\u00a0\n\u201cHe has been strange lately,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cAsking me vaguely about marriage offers.\u201d\n\u201cMarriage offers?\u201d Wei Ying asks, wrinkling his nose. \u201cStill?\u201d\n\u201cI tell him I am not open to them, and he says that of course, he knows this, but if I were, would I want this or that,\u201d Lan Wangji sighs.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re for him? Is he thinking about marrying a second wife?\u201d Wei Ying asks. \u201cBut Gusu Lan doesn\u2019t usually practice plural marriages.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. This has been his line of thinking as well.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, anyway,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cCould we still -\u201d He stretches his body sinuously. The modified spirit net that holds him cuts into his ass and his thighs in a pleasing manner.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees again, and resumes fingering him through the netting.\u00a0\n\u2014\nThat night, Lan Xichen and Qin Su settle down at the hanshi\u2019s table for the evening. It is still light outside, so they have some time before they must retire. As usual, they sit at opposite ends of the table and allow their ankles to cross while they silently amuse themselves - Qin Su with her reading, and he with his study of a few recreational xiao compositions.\u00a0\nConcentration is difficult. The embarrassment of his encounter with his brother and Wei Wuxian earlier today has yet to entirely burn off.\n\u201cIf I might speak indecorously?\u201d he finally asks his wife. \u201cIn a - not regarding ourselves.\u201d\nShe nods with a slight smile.\u00a0\n\u201cI went to the jingshi today. Unannounced,\u201d he begins.\nQin Su\u2019s eyebrows raise a bit.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I saw - I saw, ah. My brother. In a compromising position. With Wei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Qin Su says, clearly waiting for him to begin the important part of the story. She knows he  spent time  with Nie Mingjue, and that his brother and Wei Wuxian still -  spend time.\u00a0 \n\u201cTheir embrace was quite... passionate,\u201d he tells her.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says vaguely when he looks to her for a verbal response.\u00a0\n\u201cQuite - quite elaborate,\u201d he says hesitantly. He does not explain further, in part because he is embarrassed and in part because he lacks the vocabulary for several of the things he witnessed.\u00a0\nShe quirks a small smile again. His unworldliness in these matters amuses her, for which he thanks the heavens every day.\u00a0\n\u201cI am concerned\u2026 that they are having to become creative in an effort to relieve the boredom of - of  spending time with a man,\u201d he finishes in a rush. First the waterfall, now the - whatever it was, today: clearly, imagining a woman in the room no longer satisfies them. (Oh, heavens, was the time that they were in the hot springs - no. No. Surely Wangji would not take his sworn shield there just to liven up their altercations.)\n\u201cI do not find it boring,\u201d Qin Su states fondly.\u00a0\nHe ducks his head, smiles.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you worried they will tire of one another and Wei Wuxian will leave?\u201d she asks. He has told her about their parents, so she knows that he and his brother both worry about being left, in the same way that she worries about being cornered.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Lan Xichen says. \u201cI worry that they will continue to - escalate - rather than simply breaking things off and finding their own true marital happiness.\u201d\nShe glows briefly at  marital happiness, but then flattens down. Ah. He has done something wrong.\u00a0\n\u201cYou think that they should stop seeing one another,\u201d she says evenly.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell - it\u2019s, they have to get married some time.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t they already quite committed to one another?\u201d she asks.\u00a0\n\u201cExactly the problem,\u201d he tries to explain. \u201cThey must outgrow this arrangement if they are ever to find real love.\u201d\nIndeed, he did something wrong. He does not understand what exactly he did wrong, but Qin Su tells him to think about the destructive power of the idea of legitimacy and then come back to her before asking her to explain for a sixth time. When he does something wrong and does not understand what, she allows him simply to take his punishment as it comes - in this case, he must sleep on the floor - and meditate on the reason for it over the coming days. Truly, his wife is generous.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cIt\u2019s been, oh, five years?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks Lan Zhan that evening. \u201cRight? Since we came here? Since I came here.\u201d\n\u201cWe moved here with A-Yuan five years ago, yes,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\u00a0\n\u201cHow is your brother still surprised that we\u2019re still together?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, laughing a bit.\n\u201cI cannot fathom,\u201d Lan Zhan says, looking bewildered himself. His version of bewildered, anyway. His right forelock has a slightly windswept quality to it.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cEven when I was just a visiting disciple, he was always encouraging you to hang out with me.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he sent me to, like, ambush you while you were bathing in the nude. I mean.\u201d He laughs again. \u201cEven if I\u2019d hopped on your dick right then, he couldn\u2019t have acted surprised about it later. He set it up.\u201d\n\u201cI believe he knew that I wanted us to be\u2026 friends,\u201d Lan Zhan muses.\u00a0\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want us to be  friends,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rolling his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Lan Zhan argues. \u201cAmong other things. Did you not wish to be mine?\u201d\nWei Wuxian covers his face with his hands. Cute. Lan Zhan is so cute. \u201cI guess I wanted to be friends, but also, my crush on you was out of control.\u201d\n\u201cLikewise. Xichen... mistook the nature of my regard.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cWe\u2019re not discreet.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees, a glint in his eye, no doubt thinking of the thing they did in the garden last week.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shivers pleasantly. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve always been like. Like, I didn\u2019t know what I was asking for when we were kids, but I wasn\u2019t subtle about asking for it.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you had been more direct,\u201d Lan Zhan admits.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks.\u00a0\nLan Zhan\u2019s eyes go distant. \u201cI would have ruined you in the library.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is about to ask,  How?  and possibly follow it up with,  Fuck it, let\u2019s just go there, you can show me, when his husband refocuses. \u201cPeople knew even during the war,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cWe had silencing talismans, but we were in a tent. People heard things.\u201d\n\u201cHa. Yeah. Remember, Nie Mingjue gave you a talk about not wearing me out faster than my golden core could handle?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says, pulling the tiniest little face of discomfort. It\u2019s fine for Lan Zhan to re-enact all kinds of nasty porn with Wei Wuxian, but apparently his brother\u2019s sworn shield clapping him on the back and telling him,  Now, Wangji, don\u2019t go snapping Wei Wuxian in half, we need him, is a step too far.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you - this is crazy. I know. But do you think your brother even  knows we\u2019re married?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks.\u00a0\n\u201cHe was there,\u201d Lan Zhan says slowly.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sighs. \u201cYeah, he congratulated us on our marital union and everything. Like, we knew he kind of thought we were joking, but\u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cI mean, at least it helped us out?\u201d\nLan Zhan dips his head slightly in agreement. \u201cMn. I have never seen the elders so visibly mortified as when Xichen giggled during our handfasting.\u201d\n\u201cOh, heavens, remember Lan Ju\u2019s face?\u201d Wei Wuxian reminisces. \u201cHe was practically blushing.\u201d\n\u201cI still believe that our union was welcomed so warmly in part to compensate for his rudeness.\u201d Lan Zhan looks pleased with this, like they pulled off a trick.\nWei Wuxian smiles helplessly. \u201cYou\u2019re right, yeah, Lan Xichen did us a favor.\u201d\nLan Zhan says, \u201cMn. But he should have acclimated to our marriage long ago.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian makes an emphatic I know! gesture and sighs again.\n\u201cHe does not... understand the nature of my regard for you,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cI should be clearer with him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been pretty fucking clear,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, exasperated. \u201cWe both have. He knows you  regard me very well.\u201d Never one to miss an opportunity, he leers a little. Then he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s like he still doesn\u2019t get cut-sleeves. It\u2019s kind of amazing. I mean. He knows you so well.\u201d\nLan Zhan blinks.\nWei Wuxian sputters, \u201cBecause, you know, you\u2019re - you\u2019re the  most cut-sleeve. Of anyone.\u201d\n\u201cMn. Thank you,\u201d Lan Zhan says dryly. The tips of his ears are red, though. He likes that Wei Wuxian likes girls too and chose him anyway. It plays into their whole thing about Lan Zahn seducing him away from a future of boring, conventional married life in favor of\u2026 okay, still boring married life, but a very sexy cut-sleeve take on it.\u00a0\nSpeaking of married life - \u201cWe even have a  kid. I gave birth to the future sect leader,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, who did no such thing. \u201cHow is your brother still - whatever. Whatever. Hey, fuck it. We can deal with him later. There\u2019re more important things to do right now.\u201d\nLan Zhan looks at him.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian wheedles, leaning forward. \u201cShow me what you would\u2019ve done to me in the library.\u201d\u00a0\nVery subtly, Lan Zhan perks up. It\u2019s his version of leaping to his feet and running off with Wei Wuxian somewhere. (Well, no; he\u2019s actually leapt to his feet and run off with Wei Wuxian before. But he\u2019s into it, Wei Wuxian can tell.) \u201cThere?\u201d Lan Zhan asks.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian considers it. \u201cForbidden section, after hours?\u201d he suggests.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees.\u00a0\n\u201cBut we can practice now. Here,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\nLan Zhan demurs.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wei Wuxian whines.\nLan Zhan\u2019s eyes go far away again. \u201cI want you\u2026 unprepared,\u201d he says softly.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shivers again. \u201cMean,\u201d he says. \u201cSo mean, making me wait.\u201d\nLan Zhan just brushes a kiss to his hairline and whispers in his ear, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u2014\nLan Xichen\u2019s concerns about Wangji and Wei Wuxian come to a head one day when Lan Xichen receives a promising missive regarding a possible marriage for Wangji.\u00a0\nThe Gan sect\u2019s Gan Ye is recently of marriageable age and thoroughly suitable to marry a second son of a clan\u2019s main branch. The letter tests the waters regarding a match, outlining her personal accomplishments and the Gan sect\u2019s strategic position as known experts in agricultural cultivation.\u00a0\nAs luck would have it, Wangji is right there in the administrative center, handling follow-up correspondence about a few night hunts. Wei Wuxian is also there. Sometimes it seems like he hangs out and pesters Wangji just for fun. Their relationship really is so odd. In this case, though, perfect! Lan Xichen can run the idea past Wangji right now. With no embarrassing walk-ins this time, since he can see both Wangji and Wei Wuxian and he knows that they\u2019re not getting up to anything at the moment.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cWangji,\u201d Xichen says.\u00a0\nThe barely-restrained excitement in his voice tips Lan Wangji off. Whatever this is, he may not like it. \u201cMn,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cI have received an interesting missive from the Gan sect.\u201d\nFor an instant Lan Wangji thinks this is about a night hunt. Then his hopes are dashed.\u00a0\n\u201cGan Ye is seeking a husband,\u201d Xichen continues.\u00a0\n Oh, bother, Lan Wangji thinks.\n\u201cShe might be a good match for you,\u201d Xichen says.\u00a0\n\n Oh, bother again. Bother quite a lot.\u00a0 \n\nAcross the table, Wei Ying looks up from his work, wide-eyed.\u00a0\n\u201cShe possesses many admirable qualities,\u201d Xichen continues. His voice fades into the background for Lan Wangji. His attention is on his husband. Wei Ying\u2019s beautiful eyes are slightly glassy. His pout trembles.\u00a0\n Lan Zhan, Wei Ying mouths more than says.\u00a0\nLan Wangji looks deep into Wei Ying\u2019s eyes and attempts to communicate, through eyebrow speech alone,  Wei Ying, I literally have no idea. I am so sorry. I will make this up to you. (Sexually.) \nWhile Xichen goes on to detail the missive about the potential match aloud, Lan Wangji quietly, urgently makes heartfelt apologies to Wei Ying.\n\u201cTruly, I do not know where he could possibly -\u201d Lan Wangji begins.\u00a0\nWei Ying says, \u201cLan Zhan, I know you didn\u2019t ask him to look for someone, but are you sure the clan doesn\u2019t expect -\u201d\n \u201cUniquely accomplished in the Gan sect\u2019s agricultural style of cultivation,\u201d Xichen reads with relish.\u00a0\n\u201cUncle gave you my grandmother\u2019s forehead ribbon to be used for ceremonial occasions. If even  he understands -\u201d\n\u201cI just - I don\u2019t - if I\u2019m not really considered your -\u201d\n \u201cImproving growth yield,\u201d  Xichen reads.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Lan Wangji assures him with great urgency. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know A-Yuan is your son, in that sense, the elders all signed off on his adoption, but -\u201d\n \u201cPurifying the land to increase its fecundity,\u201d Xichen lists.\u00a0\n \u201cOur son -\u201d\n \u201cEnsuring fertile harvest,\u201d Xichen lists.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy does he keep -\u201d\n \u201cAnd strong birthing hips,\u201d Xichen touts, then coughs in startlement.\u00a0\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Lan Wangji announces loudly, rising to his feet. He pulls Wei Ying up, too. \u201cWei Ying and I must leave now. I have no intention to marry Gan Ye. In fact, I intend specifically not to marry her. Or anyone else who inquires. Goodbye.\u201d\u00a0\nHe tows Wei Ying out of the room.\nHalfway to the jingshi, Wei Ying tugs him behind a tree by the belt. \u201cThat was fucked up, but you\u2019re really hot when you\u2019re telling someone off,\u201d he whispers, and pulls Lan Wangji into a kiss. So Lan Wangji thinks he is not at this time being held accountable for his brother\u2019s egregious behavior.\u00a0\nHe resolves to make it up to Wei Ying (sexually) anyway.\u00a0\n\u2014\nQin Su makes her lovely but willfully stupid husband sleep on the floor that evening.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Gusu Lan Clan does not partake in multiple marriages. Are you trying to get that started up? Do you want a second wife?\u201d she asks him sharply.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Lan Xichen says.\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI would hate to be the first wife in the history of the Lan clan to dissatisfy her husband so thoroughly.\u201d Her outrage is only somewhat for effect.\u00a0\n\u201cNever. Qin Su, you complete me,\u201d Lan Xichen says, with all apparent earnestness.\u00a0\n\u201cHm. So you just want to kick Wei Wuxian out of the Cloud Recesses,\u201d she concludes.\u00a0\nLan Xichen says, \u201cWell, eventually, when it\u2019s time for both of them to move on from this youthful dalliance. Both Wangji  and Wei Wuxian deserve to find a - a real, non-imaginary woman...\u201d\n\u201cDo you want them on the  streets?\u201d  Qin Su asks. \u201cDo you want A-Yuan to be  homeless?\u201d \n\u201cNever, of course not, merely -\u201d\nThis conversation continues for some time. Her husband is breathtakingly accomplished in straddling the line between simple misunderstanding and outright disregard for his brother\u2019s cut-sleeve marriage.\nQin Su won\u2019t stand for such disrespect against two people who have gone out of their way to help her feel at home here. Especially not when she has just begun making subtle inquiries into her poor half-brother\u2019s living situation, and whether or not he might like to study at the Cloud Recesses for a change of scenery. (Her poor cut-sleeve half-brother, specifically; she has several.)\nThree nights on the floor for Lan Xichen, perhaps.\u00a0\n\u2014\nLan Wangji takes Wei Ying with him to the sect\u2019s receiving hall the following day and insists on an appointment to see Xichen.\u00a0\n\u201cHanguang-Jun, you may enter at any time,\u201d the disciple manning the door says tentatively.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is the principle of the thing,\u201d Lan Wangji says darkly. \u201cI require an  official appointment.\u201d\nThe disciple clears his throat. \u201cVery well,\u201d he says. \u201cI have\u2026 two sticks of incense past noon?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees.\n\u2014\nIt is more like four sticks of incense past noon when they finally are seen by Lan Xichen, leader of the Lan sect.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for agreeing to see us,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He makes it sound like  fuck you for making this necessary.\u00a0 \n\u201cLan Wangji, of course,\u201d Lan Xichen says reassuringly. \u201cI hope you realize I will not force you into any marriage at all. I only wish for you to be open to happiness.\u201d\nReally, how rude.\n\u201cI am very happy,\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s husband growls. \u201cAnd not open at all.\u201d And then he pulls off his forehead ribbon and wraps it around both of their wrists.\u00a0\nLan Xichen gapes at him.\u00a0\nLan Zhan gestures forcefully at Wei Wuxian with his free hand. \u201cThis is my husband,\u201d he says very slowly. He emphasizes  this;  Wei Wuxian is here for demonstration purposes, but clearly the issue is between Lan Zhan and Lan Xichen at this point. Wei Wuxian kind of likes it.  This,  like he\u2019s an object. It\u2019s both sexy and very final. There\u2019s nothing complicated or disputable about simply declaring,  this is my sword. This is my hair ribbon. This is my husband.\u00a0 \nLan Zhan is wildly possessive in normal situations. It turns out that he becomes more so when someone - even his brother - tries to casually deny his marriage of a decade.\nGods, Lan Zhan\u2019s righteous anger is always so intense and sexy.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian almost feels bad for Lan Xichen, who\u2019s receiving all of the intensity and none of the sexiness.  Almost feels bad.\u00a0\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d Wei Wuxian muses out loud, \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for\u2026 almost ten years? Thereabouts?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\u00a0\n\u201cSince you were fifteen?\u201d Lan Xichen asks, voice upticking a bit on the last syllable before he reasserts his calm.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, since Lan Zhan claimed me in Lan Yi\u2019s cave,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\u00a0\nLan Xichen blanches. \u201c... claimed,\u201d he echoes.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, not  ravished me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cJust handfasted me into the Lan clan with Lan Yi and her many rabbits as witnesses to our marital union.\u201d\n\u201cNon-traditional of you,\u201d Lan Xichen says faintly.\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees, with a clear undercurrent of  and what of it? \n\u201cBut then - when was our next marriage?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks Lan Zhan.\u00a0\n\u201cImmediately after the war. Lotus Pier,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cAncestral hall.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThat time we did the bows and everything. Jiang Cheng was even there. We had tea afterwards, too. So, double married.\u201d\n\u201cTriple,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\u00a0\n\u201cTriple?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks.\n\u201cThe temple in Qinghe last year,\u201d Lan Zhan reminds him.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, true. Oh! And I guess the - time - in Yiling,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He had been about to say  inn,  but that felt a little too blunt. \u201cWith the -\u201d turned away from Lan Xichen, he mouths to Lan Zhan,  liquor.\u00a0 \n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees, although he has mournfully (in his way) lamented not remembering that particular time.\n\u201cGusu Lan never held a wedding,\u201d Lan Xichen says helplessly.\u00a0\n\u201cAgain, I would argue that you did,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI met Lan Yi. She accepted me, blessed our union, gave us an artifact of unimaginable power, and sent us on a quest to save the cultivation world from destruction.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Lan Zhan says, staring Lan Xichen down, even though Lan Xichen\u2019s chair on the dais makes him the tallest person in the room. \u201cI am married. This is my husband. I will not marry any other. Is that clear?\u201d\n\u201cI - yes,\u201d Lan Xichen says, still looking a bit bewildered. Good. Let him stew in it.\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lan Zhan says, likely thinking the exact same thing. \u201cNow. Wei Ying, beloved of my heart, my spouse, my soulmate, let us go see our son. Whom we have raised. As married co-parents.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Xichen startles.\n\u201cOf course, dear husband,\u201d Wei Wuxian coos, looking into Lan Zhan\u2019s pretty eyes, not putting on an act in the slightest. \u201cYou know A-Yuan, of course, Lan Xichen. Our son. Your nephew. The one who considers you his favorite uncle.\u201d\nLan Xichen swallows. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, with a rasp.\u00a0\nWith that sorted out, Wei Wuxian and Lan Zhan turn (with only a little fumbling - they are still tied together), leave the assembly hall, and go to find A-Yuan.\n\u2014\n\u201cSo what have you learned?\u201d Qin Su asks her husband that evening.\u00a0\nIn the rote, measured tone of a Lan disciple reciting the rules, Lan Xichen says, \u201cNo marrying my brother off to strange women. Or any woman. Or anyone.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood. And what have you earned?\u201d\nLan Xichen gives her a smile and a soft sigh. \u201cAnother night on the floor?\u201d he asks peaceably.\u00a0\nShe tsks. \u201cOh, my heart,\u201d she says, cupping his cheek in her hand. \u201cOf course you have.\u201d\nShe must write to her mother in the morning. Qin Su has trained Lan Xichen so well; she\u2019ll be quite proud.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2014\nGoing forward, Lan Wangji takes to publicly, solicitously waiting hand and foot on Wei Ying. Even more so than he did previously, that is. Usually while staring aggressively at his brother, daring him to claim that he does not see it.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat chili oil would you like tonight\u2026 my stars?\u201d he asks Wei Ying at dinner.\u00a0\nWei Ying says, \u201cOh, either of the green ones will do,\u201d so Lan Wangji pulls them both out of the lacquered box in which he carried them to the main hall. Makes direct eye contact with Lan Xichen and asks, \u201cDear heart, may I apply them for you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Lan er-gege,\u201d Wei Ying agrees. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when to stop.\u201d And then he does not tell him to stop until his food is obscured until an absurd mass of spice.\u00a0\nThroughout this process, Lan Wangji does not break eye contact. He only looks away once Lan Xichen nods hesitantly.\u00a0\nIn addition to making certain public displays, Lan Wangji also refers pointedly to Wei Ying as  his husband  and to A-Yuan as  their son. Perhaps he will let up on the needless displays in front of Lan Xichen one day, but he thinks he will continue to do this part for the rest of their lives.\u00a0\nWhen discussing A-Yuan\u2019s performance in school: \u201cYes, A-Yuan - that is, my son, who is also Wei Ying\u2019s son, because we are married, and he is our child - is doing quite well, and excited to begin learning basic musical notation.\u201d\nWhen leaving for a night hunt: \u201cI am to depart soon with my husband, Wei Ying, to whom I am married, in order to handle the issue on the Qinghe-Mo border.\u201d\nWhen returning from a night hunt: \u201cI am back from my night hunt with Wei Ying, the man to whom I am married. Wei Ying, who can otherwise be referred to as -\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYour husband, yes,\u201d Lan Xichen says. He grew tired of hearing Wangji refer to Wei Wuxian as though he is the most titled lord in all the land -  Wei Ying, my husband, to whom I am married, and with whom I am raising our son, A-Yuan, whom we co-adopted, as his married parents  - within days. Then, after about a month, it became rather funny. Who knew that sustained outrage was all that was needed to bring out a sort of absurdist humor in Wangji? The humor value faded within a year or so, after it became routine. Now, Lan Xichen simply expects Wangji to refer to Wei Wuxian this way. He has forgotten, for the most part, that Wangji used to just call his husband  Wei Ying, and that he still refers to him as such with other people.\u00a0\nLan Xichen sighs and says, \u201cThank you, Wangji. I look forward to seeing you and your husband of several years, Wei Wuxian, and your co-parented son, A-Yuan, at dinner in your family home two nights from now.\u201d\nWangji gives a sharp, approving nod - a warning nod, Lan Xichen might say, were there such a thing - and marches out. Presumably to go spend time with his son, A-Yuan, who is also Wei Wuxian\u2019s son, because they co-parent him, because they adopted him together, because they are married to each other.\u00a0\n\u2014\n(At a conference the following year, Sect Leader Yao asks Lan Xichen about Wangji\u2019s marriageability.\u00a0\n\u201cGusu Lan does not practice plural marriage,\u201d Lan Xichen says.\u00a0\n\u201cMy daughter is not married. Is your brother?\u201d Sect Leader Yao asks.\u00a0\nLan Xichen gestures between Wangji and Wei Wuxian - currently canoodling on the steps of Koi Tower - and says, \u201cWhy, Sect Leader Yao, Hanguang-Jun is already married.\" Summoning all of the ability to lie that he has, he adds, \"I cannot imagine why a person might think otherwise.\u201d)"
