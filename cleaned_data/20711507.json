    "text": "She looked lovely, standing at the balcony, staring out at the city scattered beneath her feet.\u00a0\nHer brown hair caught in the wind and revealed her pale, bare shoulders, as pale as the hands gripping the railing, and the bare feet peeking out from beneath the sheer white shift she wore.He could see the narrow nip of her waist, the gentle flare of her hips, and her thin tapering legs.\nThe wind blew more constantly, and her hair whipped forward, covering her face.\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t move.\u00a0\nShe might be cold.\nHe slipped his cloak off his shoulders and approached her, dropping it over her shoulders and gently brushing back the curls obscuring her eyes.\u00a0\nShe still didn\u2019t move.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\u00a0\nShe was silent for several seconds. \u201cMany things.\u201d\nHis fingers curled into a slow fist when she failed to say anything else. \u201cSuch as?\u201d\nThere was a longer silence, and he watched her knuckles turn white. Her body began to shake minutely.\u00a0\n\u201cI was calculating how many seconds it would take me to hit the ground if I jumped off the balcony. How many people are dead because of me. How many will die if I stay alive. And how many you\u2019ll kill if I died now,\u201d she finally said in a forced, automatic voice.\nA curdling sensation swept through his gut. His lip curled into a snarl as he gripped her shoulder and forced her to turn and face him.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill them all if you die.\u201d\nHer lovely brown eyes were flat as she looked up at his face and nodded slowly. \u201cThat was my conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said in clipped voice.\u00a0\nHe let go of her and stalked back inside.\u00a0\nOnce he was alone, he wrenched open a drawer in his closet and pulled out an old photo of her. Her eyes were bright and dancing, and he watched as she wrapped her arms around Potter and Weasley, threw back her head, and laughed.\u00a0\nHe could almost hear it, although she hadn\u2019t laughed for years now.\u00a0\nShe feigned it\u2014polite chuckles in response to his jokes or the jokes of his friends. Her eyes always stayed flat. The light in them didn\u2019t dance; the corners didn\u2019t crinkle. She never gripped her chest or gasped as though she couldn\u2019t breathe from it.\nShe was never happy.\nNothing he gave her was ever enough.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d set fire to the world around him, but never let a flame touch her.\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t calculated that her unbearable sense of empathy meant she\u2019d feel it all anyway.\u00a0\nAll roads lead to Rome.\u00a0\nDraco had read the line in a book as a child, hadn\u2019t had the faintest idea what it meant, and been too nervous to ask his father.\u00a0\nFor as long as he could remember, everyone told him he was smart. His mother. His father. His grandparents. The parents of other children.\nHe was Draco Malfoy. He was smart. He was going to break hearts.\u00a0\nThose were the pillars upon which he built his identity.\u00a0\nHe tried very hard throughout his life to only do things that would ensure people would continue thinking he was smart. He didn\u2019t ask questions when he felt like he was probably supposed to know the answer. He didn\u2019t try to do things if he wasn\u2019t sure if he could succeed at them.\u00a0\nHe cheated\u2014which might have been rather unfair of him, but if he was smart enough to get away with it, didn\u2019t that just highlight the point?\nYet, somehow, life had really not gone nearly as well as he\u2019d hoped.\u00a0\nFor one thing, being Draco Malfoy had become disgraceful. For another, he\u2019d spent his entire formal education at Hogwarts being soundly trounced academically by a Muggle-born. And finally, and most recently, said Muggle-born was was in the process of stomping his heart into pieces.\nAll roads might have led to Rome once, but in Draco\u2019s life and experience they all led to bushy-haired, bossy-voiced, know-it-all, swot extraordinaire Hermione Granger.\u00a0\nNo matter which choice he made, or which aspect of his identity he had tried to lean into, Granger\u2019s irritatingly large eyes somehow appeared in the horizon of his life and proceeded to bowl him over.\u00a0\nHe was never the smart one when she was in the room. Not ever. Not even remotely. Granger just oozed brilliance out of her pores. Any accomplishment Draco had ever managed, Granger had probably done it two or three years prior and without training.\u00a0\nHe was Draco Malfoy and, as Malfoys do, he\u2019d gone and become a Death Eater, thinking that the world would be a much more delightful place if over-accomplished Mudbloods stopped mucking it up for him.\u00a0\nSomehow that road had also led to Granger: in his drawing room, screaming while his aunt tortured her. As he\u2019d stood frozen in horror, it dawned on him that a world without over-accomplished Mudbloods wasn\u2019t a world in which he was any better, it was just a world with a lower ceiling.\nSo he\u2019d turned on his heel and walked away from the entire ideology of it. He\u2019d thought a one hundred and eighty degree turn would send him in a direction in which Granger would never cross paths with him again.\nAnd yet\u2026\u00a0\nDraco wasn\u2019t sure if his world was just that small, or Granger somehow loomed incredibly large, or possibly she did something to disrupt physics or gravity that constantly put her into whatever path he took.\u00a0\nThey\u2019d ended up on the same charity board, which he\u2019d told himself would be fine given that it was a large charity and he was not really an active member aside from writing numerous cheques for them. But then somehow he\u2019d been dragged into hosting a charity gala, which had resulted in his having to plan the said gala with Granger.\u00a0\nDraco had told himself it was fine as he was dragged rapidly down yet another road involving Granger\u2019s extremely large, bright eyes, and thoughtfully pursed lips. He\u2019d swerve at the last moment or perform a Wronski Feint or something, and the road would go around Granger.\u00a0\nHe reminded himself of it the entire evening while he downed glass after glass of champagne, and danced holding her in his arms, and repeatedly drowned in her aggravatingly enormous eyes.\nIt was fine, until it wasn\u2019t fine any more.\nIt turned out, in retrospect, that Draco had drunk too many glasses of champagne while telling himself that it really was going to be the last time he interacted with Granger. As they stood in the empty ballroom, Granger kicked off her shoes and pulled out the pins keeping her hair in place while helping the house-elves clean up. Her eyes kept getting larger and closer, and when she looked up at him and made a joke about the melting ice sculpture, Draco forgot about swerving.\u00a0\nHe kissed her.\u00a0\nHe kissed her and she kissed him back, and they kept kissing and made it all the way up the staircase and down the hall into his room. He\u2019d pulled her dress off and tangled his hands in her bushy hair; drank in the moans that dripped from her clever mouth; and nibbled and nipped and kissed her brilliant skin; and watched her enormous eyes grow dark.\u00a0\nWhen he came inside her, and then fell asleep kissing her and holding her in his arms, he decided that maybe all roads were supposed to lead to Granger. Maybe that was the point.\u00a0\nExcept she was gone when he woke the next morning; and he\u2019d been lying in bed for ten hours now, trying to re-evaluate his entire existence once again.\u00a0\nHis road had led to Granger, but now that he\u2019d reached her, she\u2019d gone, gathered her things, and left without a word to anyone, not even the house-elves.\nHe took a despairing drag from the cigarette dangling between his fingers.\nNow that there was no doe-eyed Granger on his horizon, he wasn\u2019t sure what direction he was supposed to go in. Since the age of eleven there had always been two directions\u2014towards Granger or away from Granger, and they\u2019d always ended up being the same direction in the end.\u00a0\nNow it felt as though the needle in his compass was left spinning wildly, and he didn\u2019t know anymore which direction was towards her or away from her or anything else about the nature of the universe.\nTherefore, he had decided not to get out of bed until he died.\u00a0\nHe theorised that if he smoked and drank aggressively enough he could probably cut his estimated life-span in half, which meant only forty or fifty years of mourning.\nHis mother came and tried to force him to come down for lunch and he flatly refused.\u00a0\nHe drank firewhiskey all afternoon and when he was on the verge of passing out or maybe dying from alcohol poisoning, Granger materialised in his bedroom.\u00a0\n\u201cMyyyy god,\u201d he slurred and sat up to glare at her. \u201cHow is it my life always ends up fucked by you?\u201d\nShe folded her arms and stood glaring at him.\u00a0\nDraco threw his hands in the air. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do, or don\u2019t do. It\u2019s always you. Every time I walk away, I always end up coming back to you from a different angle. I can\u2019t even peaceably die in my own bed.\u201d\nDraco pressed a hand against his heart and fell back into the pillows. \u201cWhat have I ever done to you to deserve this\u2014?\u201d He blinked and then said, \u201cAside from the obvious.\u201d\nGranger still wasn\u2019t saying anything, which was fortunate because Draco had a lot to say.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve ruined my life. Obliterated my identity. I\u2019m never the smartest, and now it\u2019s not even impressive to be pure-blooded anymore\u2014and I was getting over it, but\u2014but why? Why did you have to break my heart?\u201d\nHe glared at her again, still gripping his wounded chest.\u00a0\nShe sighed and tucked several curls behind her ears. \u201cDraco\u2014I had to catch a portkey this morning. I\u2019m positive I told you.\u201d\nDraco blinked and stared up at the ceiling. Now that she mentioned it, he did recall her breathily murmuring something about not being able to stay while he was busy kissing along her throat and divesting her of the dress she\u2019d been wearing.\u00a0\nSomething about Sweden.\u00a0\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he said slowly. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\nShe stood glaring at him with her hands on her hips, drawn up to her fully unintimidating height of barely more than five feet. Her eyes were flashing, and her hair appeared to have begun moving of its own volition. There were small sparks emitting from several particularly angry looking curls.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBeing senior undersecretary to the Minister doesn\u2019t give you permission to remove an Unspeakable from their department and assign them as a personal bodyguard for your vacation to Santorini. This is a blatant abuse of power, and you will go and tell the Minister that aurors will be a perfectly acceptable security detail\u201d\u2014her voice grew deadly\u2014\u201cunless you want to find out exactly what it is that I do in the Department of Mysteries.\u201d\n\n\nShe smacked a piece of parchment down on his desk and turned on her heel.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco watched Hermione strut angrily out of his office and the door slam with a resounding bang.\u00a0\n\n\nHe leaned back with a resigned sigh and eyed the smoldering piece of paper.\u00a0\n\n\nApparently he wouldn\u2019t be proposing to her this weekend either.\u00a0\n\n\nHe twirled his wand in his fingers and stared thoughtfully at the ceiling, trying to think of a new means of prying his witch out of her beloved laboratory for a few days without tipping her off.\n\nHermione stared down at the milk toast the house-elves had placed before her.\u00a0\n\u201cDarling\u2014\u201c\nHer husband looked over his newspaper at her, his eyes glittering. \u201cYes, my light?\u201d\nIt was difficult to say whose voice dripped with more saccharine sarcasm.\u00a0\nHermione studied him for several seconds in silence before her lips curved into a razor-edged smile and she speared a piece of soggy bread with her fork.\n\u201cI just wanted to say how relieved I am that you aren\u2019t being petulant because I said you shouldn\u2019t participate in the Quidditch game this weekend.\u201d\nDraco folded his paper and laid it aside. His silver hair matched his glittering grey eyes. \u201cOf course not,  Dearest.\u00a0After all, I am \u2018old\u2019\u00a0and \u2018not nearly as fit as I like to think I am.\u2019 It brought to mind that I haven\u2019t cared for you in your old age as attentively as I should. Given that you are nearly a year older than I, I realised some proactive measures were in order.\u201d\nHermione nodded slowly. \u201cNow that I think about it, my jaw has been bothering me.\u201d\nConcern suddenly flashed in Draco\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\nA thin smile graced Hermione\u2019s face. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably for the best that I avoid  any  rigorous oral activities for the next several months, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said get rid of it, or move it,\u201d Hermione said in a cold voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said no, and I meant no. Choose a different floor, or I\u2019ll change my mind about it completely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\nShe whirled on him. \u201cOh I don\u2019t know, maybe because I don\u2019t want to have a sex \n\ndungeon\n\n!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDraco sighed with resignation and rubbed his forehead. \u201cWould the fourth floor be acceptable?\u201d\n\n\nHermione nodded and turned primly back to her paperwork. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I just don\u2019t want it in the dungeons.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it,\u201d Granger said promptly, ramming her extremely pointy elbow into his ribs.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe will not,\u201d he muttered as he doubled over and struggled against wheezing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIgnore him.\u201d Granger was smiling brightly at the concierge and handing over a credit card while her stiletto heel drove agonisingly into his foot.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere are other hotels,\u201d he said, trying not to hobble as he chased her down a long hallway. \u201cHundreds. This city is massive. It\u2019s not like this is the only hotel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d she said coldly as she reached the door and slotted the hotel key in. The lock beeped and turned green. As she gripped the knob, Draco\u2019s hand closed over hers, his heart was pounding heavily in his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGranger\u2014\u201c he said in a weak voice, struggling to find the right words. \u201cI cannot share a bed with you.\u201d\n\n\nHer eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cI\u2019m not trekking around an unfamiliar city at one o\u2019clock in the morning to find another hotel. I\u2019m tired. I have had an exceptionally long day putting up with you. I am sleeping here. If you want to go find another hotel on your own, be my guest. Now. Get. Out. Of. My. Way.\u201d\n\n\nBlood was roaring his ears as she pushed the door open and stepped in, flicking the switch by the door and kicking her shoes off in the same movement.\u00a0\n\n\nShe gave a breathy sigh of relief that coiled through his gut and sent a flush of heat across his chest as he followed her into the room and let the door shut behind him.\u00a0\n\n\nShe peeled off her slick raincoat and hung it in the closet and dropped her bag onto the dresser.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco\u2019s eyes were locked on the bed. It wasn\u2019t the smallest bed, but it looked small when his mind was filled with the thought that it would be Granger lying beside him, close enough to easily reach out towards, and she apparently had no objections whatsoever to such an arrangement.\u00a0\n\n\nThe collar on his shirt was soaked and felt stifling. He reached up, loosened his tie, and undid the top several buttons.\n\n\nHe allowed his gaze to travel away from the bed back to Granger.\u00a0\n\n\nHer hands were sliding up her leg and under the hem of her sheath dress. Draco tried not to choke audibly.\n\n\nWas she unhooking her stocking? Did she wear stockings with a garter belt? He wasn\u2019t sure if he had the fortitude to know that particular detail about her.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco felt as though he were on the verge of a heart attack as his eyes followed her pale hands as they slid along her inner-thigh.\u00a0\n\n\nMerlin\u2026\n\n\nMorgana\u2026\n\n\nCirce\u2026\n\n\nHer hands slipped out from under the hem of her dress. Her wand was gripped in her right hand.\u00a0\n\n\nShe straightened and, with a quick flick, shrank the chair, desk, and mini-fridge. She levitated them up into her hand and then lined them neatly along the top of the dresser.\u00a0\n\n\nShe waved her wand again and extended the room by an additional ten feet and then proceeded to conjure a second bed complete with duvet and several pillows.\u00a0\n\n\nShe pivoted on her heel and leveled him with a scathing glare before she added an enormous privacy curtain.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cPotter.\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy.\u201d\nHarry pressed a button on the lift and then stepped back, leaning back against the wall and folding his arms loosely as he stared at the pointy-faced prat his best friend had just announced she was dating.\nMalfoy\u2019s eyes were locked on the lift doors. His expression was cool and indifferent, but as Harry studied him,\u00a0 he noticed that the corners of Malfoy\u2019s eyes were tense and the fingers of his left hand twitched as though he were fighting the urge to reach for his wand.\u00a0\nHarry cleared his throat and watched Malfoy\u2019s entire body go rigid for a split-second. He started to open his mouth.\u00a0\n\n Hermione will murder you if you mess with him. \n\nHe shut his mouth resignedly and wished the lift would hurry up.\u00a0\nInstead, there was a grinding sound, and the lift abruptly came to a halt.\u00a0\nMalfoy let out a disbelieving breath and stepped forward, jamming his thumb repeatedly against the buttons. The lift buttons illuminated but nothing happened.\nMalfoy banged against doors and swore under his breath. He tilted his head back and rolled his jaw so that it popped audibly before turning to look at Harry.\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d was all Malfoy said before leaning back against the opposite wall and loosely folding his arms, mirroring Harry\u2019s stance.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got his wand in an arm holster, Harry realised.\u00a0\nAfter several deafening minutes of silence Malfoy snorted.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight you, Potter. If you\u2019re going to pummel me in the lift, you\u2019ll have to make the first move. Just get it over with.\u201d His teeth were bared, and he had the same nasty sneer on his face that he\u2019d worn at school.\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to attack you. Hermione will murder me if I mess with her personal life.\u201d\nMalfoy didn\u2019t relax one bit. \u201cRight,\u201d he said in a tone thick with disbelief. \u201cThe lift just happened to break with you and I in here.\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been here the whole time. So\u2014wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s eyes rolled briefly, and he turned and stared stonily at the doors.\u00a0\nThe silence dragged until Harry couldn\u2019t take any more.\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s working in the Wizengamot?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s jaw twitched. \u201cWe really don\u2019t need to talk, Potter.\u201d\nThere were several more minutes of silence.\u00a0\n\u201cSo\u2014you and Hermione,\u201d Harry said, stuffing his hands into his pockets and finding a snitch he\u2019d forgotten about. \u201cI can\u2019t say I ever expected that.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine not.\u201d Malfoy didn\u2019t look away from the doors.\u00a0\nHarry pulled the snitch out of his pocket and started tossing it and catching it. He eyed Malfoy. \u201cYou do actually care about her, right? This isn\u2019t some plan your dad hatched up to make your family look better by using her, is it?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s lip twitched and curled upward. \u201cYes, Potter, I\u2019m using her, and I\u2019m going to tell you all about it in a Ministry lift, and I chose her because there aren\u2019t any less obvious Muggleborns to date.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not? She was the Muggleborn you always said you hoped would die first. It\u2019s hard not to think this is just a different way to hurt her\u2014since it\u2019s not  fashionable  to want her dead anymore.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s jaw twitched and the tension around his eyes got more obvious. \u201cRight\u201d\u2014his voice was stiff\u2014\u201cbecause if I hurt her, it would assuredly make my family look better.\u201d\nHarry caught the snitch and gripped it. \u201cIt could be either one. Either way Hermione is the one who ends up hurt.\u201d\nMalfoy was silent for a second, and then he turned his head to look at Harry. His grey eyes were shuttered and cold. \u201cSo what now? Is this the part where you threaten me with Azkaban or grievous bodily harm? Order me to stay away from Granger or else? Do tell.\u201d\nHarry stared at him. \u201cWhy do you still call her Granger?\u201d\nMalfoy twitched and looked away. \u201cHabit.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you like her?\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t trying to come across as though he were interrogating Malfoy, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.\u00a0\nMalfoy wasn\u2019t even trying to hide his irritation. \u201cWhy do you like her?\u201d\nHarry blinked and tried to think of a way to explain Hermione.\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014Hermione,\u201d he finally said. He stuck his chin out. \u201cShe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I like her too,\u201d Malfoy said in mocking voice. \u201cAlthough I could live without the latter point.\u201d\nHarry glared at Malfoy. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like your type.\u201d\nMalfoy raised an eyebrow. \u201cMy type? And what type is that precisely?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone who can\u2019t form a thought on their own.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve always liked the stupid people who\u2019d follow you around and do whatever you told them. You weren\u2019t ever friends with anyone you thought was your equal, only people who let you feel like you were better than them.\u201d Harry was no longer trying to hide his dislike. \u201cSo\u2014yeah, Hermione doesn\u2019t really seem like your type.\u201d\nMalfoy sneered at him. \u201cDifficult as it may be for you to imagine, Potter, some of us are capable of evolving beyond our eleven year old selves.\u201d \nHis hands had curled into fists, and he looked as though he were on the verge of trying to deck Harry. \u201cWhat do you expect me to say? It\u2019s not as though it\u2019s convenient. Did you think I planned it? I\u2019ve barely gotten my life back together, and now I\u2019ve got another thing that everyone\u2019s waiting for me to fuck up.\u201d\nMalfoy slammed his fist against the doors and stood, radiating rage.\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s mouth twisted and he rolled his eyes. \u201cSo why are you publicly dating her then?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s hand slid down the door, and his shoulders slumped. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stay away from her\u2014and I didn\u2019t want her to think I was hiding her, that I didn\u2019t want to be seen with her. This way\u2014when it goes south, the way everyone expects it to, it\u2019ll be my life fucked by it.\u201d\u00a0\nHarry raised his eyebrows again and tossed the snitch into the air again. \u201cSounds weirdly noble of you.\u201d\nMalfoy snorted but he didn\u2019t say anything in response.\u00a0\nHarry leaned his head back against the wall.\n\u201cHermione goes all in on things,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cShe never bails, no matter how bad things get or what it costs her. She doesn\u2019t care whether anyone will appreciate it. She always does what she thinks is right. If she thinks someone needs her, she doesn\u2019t know how to say no to them.\u201d His chest tightened. \u201cI\u2014I took advantage of that a lot\u2014in school. I was so focused on what was happening to me that I never bothered to see how much I was asking from her without even noticing. Especially during the war.\u201d\u00a0\nHarry gripped the snitch in his fist until the bones in his palm hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that happen to her again.\u201d\nMalfoy nodded slowly, still staring intently as the doors. \u201cLet me know\u2014if she\u2019s hurting because of me.\u201d\nHarry was tempted to retort that if Malfoy hurt Hermione, Harry wouldn\u2019t be letting him know as a favour, but he bit his tongue. Malfoy sounded half-despairing.\u00a0\nThe lift suddenly jerked, descended a few more feet, and the doors slid smoothly open.\nMalfoy glanced at Harry out of the corner of his eye before straightening and walking rapidly out without a backwards glance.\u00a0\nHarry followed him slowly and watched him enter the Magical Creatures Department.\u00a0\nHermione was standing by a receptionist desk with an enormous armful of scrolls and an overstuffed satchel hanging heavily from her shoulder. There was an anxious expression on her face as she spoke rapidly to the receptionist.\u00a0\nMalfoy\u2019s walk slowed to a saunter. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t bringing all of that with you to lunch,\u201d he drawled.\u00a0\nHermione looked over. Her expression cleared and her eyes lit up. \u201cDraco\u2014I got caught in meetings and thought I might have missed you.\u201d\nMalfoy slid her bag off her shoulder and up onto his own and started taking all the scrolls. \u201cLift got jammed on the way down.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. They\u2019re levitational, they shouldn\u2019t be able to get stuck.\u201d\n\u201cCharmwork may be old. Did you still want to check out the new cafe in Diagon, or were you in the mood for something else?\u201d\u00a0\nThey were heading back towards the lifts, and Harry stepped back to avoid several elderly witches returning from lunch.\u00a0\nHermione and Malfoy passed him without a glance and entered the lift. As the doors slid shut, Harry watched her slip her hand into Malfoy\u2019s and lean her head against his shoulder. The tense, defensive expression on Malfoy\u2019s face had disappeared. As he stared down at the top of Hermione\u2019s head, his face appeared unguarded for the first time in years. Then the doors shut entirely, and the couple disappeared from view.\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d\u00a0\nHarry looked over as Ron appeared. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTrapping Malfoy in the lift with you. Jennings in maintenance owed me a favour. When I saw you get on, I legged it down the stairs. Figured half an hour was long enough for you to tell him to fuck off and leave Hermione alone.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes. \u201cYou think I was going to hex him in a Ministry lift?\u201d\u00a0\nRon shrugged cheerfully. \u201cOr throttle him. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\u201d\nHarry shook his head. \u201cHermione could castrate me ten different ways if I messed with her boyfriend. If he\u2019s not afraid to date her, I doubt there\u2019s much I can threaten him with.\u201d\nRon was eyeing him with disgust. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do a thing, did you?\u201d\nHarry stuffed his hands into his pockets and stared at the closed doors of the lift. \u201cI really didn\u2019t need to. She\u2019s got him whipped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014-umph!\u201d\n\n\nHe hummed against her lips as he backed her across the room and against the wall. His hands slid down and gathered her skirts up around her hips, his fingers skimming along her bare skin.\n\n\nHis other hand dug into her hair, pulling apart the carefully pinned curls and destroying the delicate, sparkling netting that had made her chignon shimmer mesmerisingly. He tugged her head back and pulled away from her lips in order to trail his mouth along her temple, pressing light kisses across her cheekbones, brushing off the carefully applied fairy wings which had made her look ethereal.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\n\nHe silenced her again with his mouth. His tongue slipped between her lips as he pinned her more firmly against the wall. His fingers pressing between her legs until he felt her shudder as a soft moan escaped her.\u00a0\n\n\nHe drew his lips back and nuzzled his nose against hers, pressing their foreheads together as he stroked lightly between her legs. Her hips bucked into his touch.\n\n\nHis fingers untangled from her hair. He pulled at her neckline until the fabric tore away and left her pale shoulder bare. He dipped his head and bit down on the curve of her shoulder until she gave a breathy whimper. He removed his teeth and traced his tongue over the reddening mark to soothe it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI need you\u2026\u201d he whispered huskily as his fingers captured the edge of her knickers.\u00a0\n\n\nShe gave a quiet moan but then suddenly stiffened. She stayed frozen for a moment before slapping his hand sharply away. \u201cYou\u2014dragged me away from a conversation with the Supreme Mugwump just because you wanted to have sex?\u201d\n\n\nDraco blinked.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen she put it like that, it sounded unreasonable.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2014you see\u2014\u201c he started.\n\n\nShe shoved him violently away and stared down at herself in horror before looking back up at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou are unbelievable.\u201d Her voice was shaking with indignation. \u201cYou have mocked me for months, saying that I don\u2019t have a strategic bone in my body; that if I understood a thing about politics I\u2019d know that the real decisions aren\u2019t made in meetings.\u201d Her eyes were beginning to glow. \n\n\u201cYou said if I wanted the bill passed that this\u2014this\u2014!\u201d She was nearly spitting. \u201cThis party was what I needed to attend! You dolled me up to look like some vapid fairy, had me buy a dress that cost more than three months rent for my flat, and forced me to spend five hours in a very busy day having my hair and makeup done! And then you dragged me away and ruined it all in less than twenty minutes\u2014while I was in the middle of a conversation with the Supreme Mugwump\u2014because you wanted to have sex?!\u201d\n\nShe was nearly shrieking with outrage.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco reached up and loosened his cravat, trying to calm her with the very compelling explanation he had. \u201cThere were people looking at you.\u201d\n\n\nShe stared at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cInappropriately,\u201d he added, in order to help her further understand the context.\u00a0\n\n\nShe looked as though she were on the verge of strangling him.\u00a0\n\n\nHe cleared his throat and steepled his hands, pressing the fingertips firmly together. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. You should let your hard work speak for itself. These kinds of events are for people who aren\u2019t willing to do things by their own effort.\u201d\n\n\nShe threw both stilettos heels at his head before stalking across the room onto the veranda and apparating with a deafening boom.\n\nDraco stared in confusion as Hermione abruptly stood up from their table at the cafe and turned around slowly. Her eyes were narrowed as they scanned the surrounding area.\nHis hand reached surreptitiously for his wand as he tried to determine what had set her off. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything suspicious that he could see.\n\nThe old woman counting change? Was the pigeon nearby demonstrating unusual amounts of intelligence? Were there any beetles with unusual markings?\n\n\nHis heartbeat quickened and he started to stand.\n\n\nHermione\u2019s face broke into a relieved smile and she scurried over to a\u2014flower box?\n\n\nShe leaned over and rapped her knuckles on it twice before straightening and returning to their table and continuing to eat as though nothing had happened.\n\n\nDraco stared at her for several seconds before he finally spoke. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\n\n\nShe looked up and blinked slowly as she finished chewing her salad.\n\n\n\u201cDoing?\u201d\n\n\nDraco\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cWhen you jumped up and went and hit the flower box.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Understanding dawned in her eyes. \u201cI was knocking on wood so I wouldn\u2019t jinx us.\u201d\n\n\nDraco stared at her in bafflement.\n\n\nShe waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s a Muggle thing.\u201d\n\n\nDraco raised an eyebrow. \u201cJinxing yourself?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged a shoulder as she speared a piece of chicken. \u201cI said we\u2019d still be dating in a year and could visit your mother\u2019s palazzo then. In order to keep from tempting fate there\u2019s an old Muggle apotropaic tradition of knocking on wood.\u201d\n\nDraco quirked an eyebrow and snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t even believe in Divination, a formally recognised field of magic, but you stood up in the middle of lunch in order to go tap on a flower box. And now you expect that will keep us from breaking up?\u201d\n\n\nHermione slowly raised an eyebrow of her own. \u201cWould you rather I hadn\u2019t?\u201d she asked in a pointed tone of voice.\n\n\nDraco straightened. \u201cNo! No. I didn\u2019t say that. In fact,\u201d he threw his napkin onto the table, \u201cnow that I think about it, I should go knock on it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god!\u201d\n\nThere was a frantic shuffling and slamming of closing books and then Hermione dove under the table and pulled Harry\u2019s cloak of invisibility over herself.\n\n\nA moment later, Malfoy came nonchalantly around the corner and then froze. His ferret-y face screwed up with disappointment as he stared at Harry and Ron.\n\n\nThere was a pretentious bouquet of orchids in his hands, with a flock of tiny golden birds flying around it, softly chirping a love ballad.\n\n\n\u201cPotter. Weasley. Zabini said he saw Granger studying here.\u201d\n\n\nHarry and Ron stared at each other and then back at Malfoy with confusion.\n\n\n\u201cBathroom,\u201d Ron said.\n\n\n\u201cAncient Runes,\u201d Harry said at the same time.\n\n\nThey both winced and glared at each other.\n\n\nMalfoy sneered. \u201cShe has Ancient Runes on Tuesday afternoons with Hufflepuff, Potter.\u201d\n\n\nHarry nodded awkwardly wondering how Malfoy knew that. \u201cOh right. I have no idea where she is. You could try the prefects bath.\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy\u2019s cheeks flushed bright pink and a slight choking sound escaped his throat. \u201cIf you see her, tell her I\u2019m looking for her.\u201d \n\n\nHe turned on his heel and hurried away.\n\n\nHarry waited until Malfoy\u2019s footsteps had faded before he reached under the table and tugged at his cloak. Hermione\u2019s bushy head emerged, followed by the rest of her.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly Harry, Ancient Runes on a Sunday evening?\u201d She crawled out and back into her chair.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to Malfoy? Did you love potion him?\u201d Ron was staring incredulously at her as she primly pulled her books back out of her bag.\n\n\nHermione shot a scathing glare at Ron. \u201dNo. What kind of person do you think I am?\u201d\n\n\nShe sniffed. \u201cI might as well tell you. I had rounds with him two weeks ago. He was being an utter arse as usual. I thought if I used a bit of reverse psychology on him, maybe it would make him shut up. I told him that his constant antagonism towards me probably stemmed from repressed sexual fascination.\u201d She buried her face in her hands and snorted loudly. \u201cI forgot about how utterly bizarre and antiquated purebloods are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Ron said indignantly.\n\n\nHermione lifted her head, scowled, and started furiously marking up spelling errors on Harry\u2019s essay.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI thought it worked. He avoided me like the plague for a week and every time he saw me his face would turn red. But then\u2014\u201c her voice jumped, \u201cwhen we had rounds on Thursday night, he told me that I was right and he\u2019d written and informed his parents of his intention to formally court me so we can get married following graduation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Ron was staring at Hermione in stunned admiration. His shoulders started shaking with laughter.\n\n\n\u201cI told him no, but apparently it\u2019s traditional for a witch to be resistant, as a test of a wizard\u2019s sincerity.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShe scoffed and began tearing Harry\u2019s sentence structures apart. \u201cI thought I\u2019d put him off by seeming over-eager, so when he showed up yesterday, I acted like I was actually taking him seriously, and he snogged me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron abruptly stopped laughing.\n\n\nHermione continued without acknowledging Ron. \u201cI slapped him. Then he accused me of repressed sexual fascination!\u201d\n\n\nShe added a comma so violently that it tore the parchment. She laid her quill down and curled her hands into fists, drawing a deep breath as though trying to calm herself. \u201cSo\u2014I\u2019m employing a strategic retreat\u2014until I figure out what to do.\u201d\n\n\nHarry shook his head. \u201cOnly you, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\nRon leaned forward, his eyes suspicious. \u201cDo you have any repressed sexual fascination with Malfoy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nDraco quirked an eyebrow and leaned back in his chair. \u201cWant?\u201d\nShe scowled at him and pulled an envelope out of her bag, throwing it venomously down on his desk. The force caused the flap to open, and several pictures slid out.\nThey featured Granger\u2019s extremely recognizable face involved in a scene that would, even conservatively, be termed an orgy.\nShe wasn\u2019t engaged in anything illegal, but the very existence of the photos was career-ruining in a culture as fastidiously conservative as the British Ministry of Magic.\nDraco only glanced at them for a few moments before looking back up at her.\nHer cheeks were stained scarlet as she glared at him. \u201cI assumed this envelope was from you\u2014given that you\u2019re the only one who continues to see the need to interfere and try to destroy everything I do.\u201d Her voice was shaking and slightly choked. Her teeth were bared, and she looked nearly feral. \u201cSo\u2014obviously: you. What do you want?\u201d\nDraco leaned back and gave her a hard smile. \u201cNow, now, Granger, think of how much weaker an opponent you\u2019d be if I hadn\u2019t been here all these years, going to all the trouble of bringing all your legislative loopholes and vulnerabilities to your attention.\u201d\nHis smile grew razor-sharp, and he laced his fingers together, resting his chin on the knuckles. \u201cI must admit I was beginning to question whether I\u2019d ever manage to knock you low enough that you\u2019d finally come crawling into my office. However, even Muggles know the higher the climb, the longer the fall. It just goes to show that none of us are perfect\u2014not even you.\u201d\nHis eyes peeled away from her, and he reached down to pick up one of the photos. He stared at it for several seconds while Granger seethed.\n\u201cSince we\u2019re here\u2014alone\u2014I have to ask,\u201d he finally said without looking away from the photo. \u201cWhat on earth possessed you to do something this idiotic?\u201d He glanced up at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your eyes on the Minister\u2019s seat since before you graduated. You had to have known this kind of\u2014indulgence had the potential to destroy all your dreams in a manner both permanent and spectacular.\u201d\nHe tsked and shook his head before flashing one of the photos at her. She immediately averted her eyes.\nGranger\u2019s cheeks were stained red but the rest of her face was steadily growing whiter and whiter.\nHer mouth worked soundlessly for a moment before she swallowed visibly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d she finally said in a strained voice.\nDraco snorted. He was tempted to roll his eyes and assure her that that much abundantly obvious, but instead he waited to hear her try to explain it.\n\u201cIt was\u2014it was\u2014\u201d She looked as though she were on the verge of fainting in front of him. \u201cHe\u2014he said I treated my job like it mattered more than our relationship. That I\u2014always based my decisions on it, rather than him. It was\u2014it was supposed to\u2014\u201c her throat bobbed, \u201cto spice things up. I didn\u2019t know it was going to be\u2014like that. He promised it was very discreet.\u201d\nDraco snorted again and glanced at the date on the back of the photo. \u201cAnything Pucey knows about does not fall anywhere in the realm of discreet. You should have asked me,\u201d he leered over the photo at her. \u201cI could recommend several places that take the privacy of their clientele seriously\u2014if this is your kind of thing.\u201d\nHis eyes slid over her, and then flicked back to the photos on his desk.\nHer chest was heaving sharply. \u201cWhat do you want, Malfoy?\u201d\nHe cocked his head slowly to the side, laying the photo down and tracing his fingertips lightly over it. \u201cCome now, Granger, put that oversized brain of yours to work. What do you think I want?\u201d\nA decade earlier and she probably would have cried. Granger used to cry about things. When she was angry, or overwhelmed, or happy, or sad, she cried.\nShe appeared to have rooted out the habit at some point, although not\u2014he noted, some of her other ones. Her fingernails had been bitten to the quick, and she stared at him with her lower lip caught between her teeth.\n\u201cI won\u2019t withdraw the bill,\u201d she said after a moment. Her voice almost a whisper but nearly vibrating with determination. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you threaten to do with those. You can ruin me.\u201d\nDraco snorted and rolled his eyes. \u201cGood gracious, Granger, you still have all the subtlety of a beater bat. How exactly would forcing you to withdraw your beloved house-elf protections bill benefit me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She\u2019d begin shaking with rage. \u201cHow have any of your attempts to block my legislation benefited you? At this point I just assume you exist to try getting in my way.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word in opposition to the WRA,\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow pointedly. \u201cIt was legislatively flawless. I believe I even sent you a congratulatory note on your excellent work.\u201d\nShe looked angry enough to spit at him.\nDraco shrugged and gathered up the photos again, flipping through them slowly. He paused at one and stared at it for several seconds before turning it so she could see. \u201cThis is a lovely shot of you. You have better tits than I would have credited you with.\u201d\nShe twitched and her jaw started trembling. \u201cJust\u2014tell me what you want. You have infinitely more money than I do, unless you just want to ruin me financially. Do want me to remove my name as a sponsor of the bill? Are you expecting me to withdraw from politics altogether?\u201d The trembling appeared to have spread from her jaw into the rest of her body, she was swaying like a broken tree branch. \u201cJust tell me what it is; I\u2019m sick of trying to guess what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nDraco looked down and slid the photos neatly back into the envelope. \u201cAs it happens, Granger\u2026\u201d he said her name slowly. \u201cThere are several things I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\nShe stared at him for a moment, and then her eyes widened and she looked as though she were on the verge of screaming or bolting.\nHe chuckled under his breath and tapped the sharp corner of the envelope on his desk. \u201cYou do have a filthy mind, even if a sex club wasn\u2019t to your... tastes. No, despite how surprisingly lovely your tits are, I didn\u2019t send this because I wanted a turn as well.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t relax in the slightest.\nDraco leaned back and stared coolly across his desk at her. \u201cI want you to add my name as one of the sponsors for your house-elf protections legislation, and I want you to include me on whatever your next campaign is. I want to be consulted, I want to be a co-sponsor. I want a seat at the highly exclusive little table of do-gooders, and you will be the one to get it for me and ensure that I stay there. And\u2014\u201c he gave her a slow smile, \u201cyou\u2019ll owe me favour, which I will call in someday whenever I happen to feel like it, and you will do it whatever it is that I ask.\u201d\nHe straightened as he watched her reaction carefully. \u201cIn exchange, I will ensure that these photos never again see the light of day.\u201d\nGranger stood frozen for several seconds. Her expression was masked but there was confusion behind the obvious strain in her eyes.\n\u201cI won\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d she said in a tight voice.\nDraco rolled his eyes. \u201cIt will be an entirely legal favour.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d she finally said in a voice that only had a hint of tremour underlying it. \u201cI want a blood oath.\u201d\nWhen it was done, Granger gripped the vial in her hands as she backed away from him towards the door.\nDraco stepped back over to his desk and caught up the envelope, flashing her a final grin. \u201cDid you want these as a keepsake?\u201d\nShe shot him a look of pure loathing as she disappeared through the door.\nThe smile dropped from his face the instant she was gone. Draco slid the envelope into his robes, withdrew his wand, and cast a quick disillusionment on himself before stepping out of his office. He moved slowly in order to make as little a visual disturbance as possible.\nAt the first hallway, he turned and walked quietly down it until he stood outside an innocuous, and difficult to notice broom closet.\nHe pressed his ear to the door and listened to rapid, hyperventilating sobs for a few seconds before stepping back and pulling the envelope out of his pocket. He slid a photo up just enough to verify the date on the back once more.\nJust days before her very public breakup with Adrian Pucey.\nHe tapped the envelope against his fingers for a moment before heading up towards the Ministry floo.\n\u00a0\n\u201cZabini.\u201d\nBlaise cracked an eye open and found Malfoy staring down at him with an icy expression on his face.\nHe blinked, pushed off the naked witch draped over him, and sat up. He hadn\u2019t seen Malfoy in years and hadn\u2019t expected to wake and find him in his bedroom.\n\u201cWhy the fuck are you blackmailing Granger?\u201d\nBlaise rubbed his eyes and gave the pretentious wanker a droll smirk. \u201cEasy target. Easy money. Mother\u2019s training.\u201d He shrugged as he stood up. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s lip curled. \u201cShe assumed this was from me. Did it not occur to you she\u2019d have trouble paying you off if she didn\u2019t even know who sent them.\u201d\nBlaise yawned and pulled on a robe. \u201cI fancied leaving her to stew and panic about how bad it\u2019d be before moving in for the kill. She must be frantic if she went straight to you. It\u2019s convenient you came by; you deal with her all the time. How much would you say she\u2019s worth?\u201d\nHe eyed Malfoy while he stretched his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m thinking installments rather than a lump sum. She\u2019ll probably be good for a few years at least.\u201d His pulled a velvet cord on the wall to call for a late breakfast and coffee. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck when Pucey brought her through the door. I think she must have sedated herself, she went with it for less than an hour, then panicked and bolted.\u201d He nodded towards the envelope in Malfoy\u2019s hand. \u201cStayed long enough though.\u201d\nMalfoy was staring at him expressionless. \u201cI want to buy all of them.\u201d\nBlaise froze as he stared at his old schoolmate.\nMalfoy was politically weaker than Granger, but financially he was a larger fish by several orders of magnitude.\nBlaise hadn\u2019t considered seeking out a third party for the photos. Granger was beloved by nearly all, with the very notable exception of Malfoy, who had an inexplicable vested interest in attempting to subvert or fuck her over with any political machinations he could scheme up.\nHe grinned at Malfoy. \u201cHow much is finally ruining her worth to you?\u201d\nIt turned out, it was worth more than three times Blaise\u2019s annual income.\nMalfoy held the cheque lazily between his thumb and index finger and stared at Blaise with glittering eyes. \u201cThis sum is conditional, Zabini. I want a list of everyone there that night.\u201d\nBlaise started to open his mouth and deny keeping records, but Malfoy leveled him with a cold glare. \u201cI\u2019m certain you have one. The last thing I need is to have her claiming it was polyjuice. I want to know exactly who the corroborating\u2014participants are.\u201d\nBlaise shrugged and retrieved it from his logbook. As he held out the list of names and extended his hand for the cheque, Malfoy held it back.\n\u201cI also want an Unbreakable Vow. I don\u2019t want to worry someone that else is going to fuck up my chess pieces once I have them in place. I want a Vow from you that I have all the photographs and any other evidence and that all the particulars of this little business arrangement will die with you.\u201d\nBlaise\u2019s throat tightened as he noticed the burning intensity in Malfoy\u2019s eyes. The man was deranged in his vendetta against Granger. Then he looked at the figure on the cheque.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco stopped at Gringotts in the evening after the day\u2019s work. He sat silently beside the goblin as the cart raced into the depths of the bank, beyond the Malfoy family vault, to a smaller private vault.\nDraco unlocked the door, stepped inside, and closed it with the attending goblin waiting outside.\nHe pulled the file with all of Blaise\u2019s pictures out of his robes, along with the envelope that Granger had brought him.\nHis jaw tensed as he stared at them. His hands shook slightly and the photos abruptly burst into flames.\nHe dropped them on the ground.\nHe walked over to all the boxes of mind-bogglingly detailed analysis of several hundred legislative documents. He dragged a finger along them as he wandered through to the far wall.\nA small postcard was pinned to the wall.\n\u201cMen of sense often learn from their enemies. It is from their foes, not their friends, that cities learn the lesson of building high walls and ships of war.\u201d\nHe stared at it for several seconds, and then sighed, and turned around. The room was burning, the fire consuming the photos had spread to the boxes.\nHe watched the fire.\nFeuding with Granger legislatively had honed her into a lethal political weapon far more rapidly than any advisor could have hoped to.\nAdvise Granger about weaknesses as a friend, and she had a habit of dismissing it and assuming the best about others; come at her as an opponent and she\u2018d strategise, strengthen her position, and then coldly outmanoeuvre them.\nDraco had thought she was nearly untouchable until that morning. He ground his teeth together. Her personal life would be the one area that she\u2019d remain vulnerable.\nObliviating Pucey had been by far the most satisfying aspect of the day. Draco had thought he wasn\u2019t a killer, but he very seriously reconsidered it when he\u2019d had a wand leveled at Pucey\u2019s face.\nDraco walked slowly around the burning boxes towards the door of the vault.\nHe paused by the door and stared at a newspaper clipping on the wall.\nIt had faded after nearly a decade.\n1998. Granger was standing in the witness stand, testifying on Draco\u2019s behalf during the post-war trial. If Draco had been found guilty, he\u2019d be up for release in three weeks.\n\nHermione Granger Wants To Save The World.\n\nHe stared at the picture and nearly reached out to touch it.\nBecoming her political rival has been accidental. She\u2019d gone straight to the Ministry after school and begun her magical rights campaign with righteous fury and no training. Her team had been equally oblivious to political pitfalls.\nDraco had not been, but no one listened to him.\nSo\u2014he wrote an editorial pointing out all the potential risks of Granger\u2019s legislation until she withdrew and reworked it. Draco kept publicly harassing her until it was ironclad.\nIt became a bizarre type of political chess. He unapologetically hounded her over her political vulnerabilities and she rapidly learned to protect herself, and spot her own legislative weaknesses without him.\nDraco was tired of feuding with her.\nHe hadn\u2019t fully appreciated that she\u2019d see their rivalry as personal or malicious until she appeared his office. He considered there to be a vast difference between being politically at odds with someone and actually wanting to ruin their life.\nNot for Granger. For her everything she did was morally rooted.\nHe sighed as he pulled the vault door open and stepped out.\nSomeday\u2014he should probably admit he\u2019d fallen for her.\nOne would think, what with magic having been around for several thousand years, basic illumination wouldn\u2019t be so hard to come by in the Wizarding world, but there wasn\u2019t even a bit of candlelight in the service hall.\nIt was pitch black, and I realised, after my shins had collided with a fourth wooden packing crate, that my wand was in my bag in the main hall where the banquet was still going on.\nI cursed under my breath while leaning over to rub my leg. I should just go back out. It was absurd to be sneaking around like a teenager in an unlit hallway, trying to find someone who probably wasn\u2019t even there.\nI straightened and sighed. I was about to turn back when a burnished red light glowed briefly in the darkness before disappearing.\nI swallowed and released a low breath. \u201cMalfoy.\u201d\nThe butt of his cigarette glowed again, longer, bright enough to illuminate his eyes.\n\u201cGranger.\u201d\nThe way he pronounced my name curled and wafted through the air like the smoke. I could hear the cigarette in the corner of his mouth.\nIt made his drawl more overt. More caressing.\nHe\u2019d always liked to toy with words with that poisonous tongue of his; experimenting with the inferred meaning of a particular form of emphasis.\nWhy say what he meant when he could imply it a dozen different ways without the inconvenience of real commitment?\nLike the rest of us, he lived his post-war life on a short leash. His was the shortest but most luxurious lead that the Ministry kept constantly under its heel.\nHis constraints had caused him to make the unspoken a type of art form.\nI envied the ability as often as it annoyed me. I wished sometimes that I could keep from saying what I meant.\nI have never been coy. I am \u201csincere.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d quit smoking,\u201d I finally said.\nThe cigarette glowed again.\nI made my way gingerly towards the light\n\u201cI am exclusively a social smoker these days.\u201d He\u2019d pulled the fag from his mouth. His words were crisp again.\nI extended my hand, trying not to run into anything or trip over him as I kept moving towards his voice.\nA hand slipped under mine, as though he were escorting me onto a dance floor. His fingers drew me forward and downwards onto the rickety service stair he was seated on.\nThe stairs were narrow and could barely accommodate the width of both our hips. As I settled in beside him, the cigarette glowed again, just long enough to illuminate his profile.\nI watched until it faded and then glanced away. \u201cHow does this qualify as social smoking?\u201d\nA pause. I heard him breathe.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\nHe shifted slightly so that my hip bone stopped digging into him.\n\u201cThere are about five hundred people on the other side of that wall,\u201d he said after a moment.\nI snorted and angled myself towards him in the darkness. \u201cThe wall being imperative. You aren\u2019t attending a party if you spend the entire time sitting in a dusty service passage smoking.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d his tone was light. \u201cBut only if you\u2019re operating with a Grangerless presupposition. I\u2019m not. Your interference is presumed therefore my eventual appearance is inevitable. I\u2019m smoking preemptively.\u201d\nI folded my hands and sighed. \u201cIt will get easier\u2014eventually.\u201d\nHe chuckled. There were several seconds of silence before he spoke again. \u201cYou keep saying that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s what everyone keeps telling me.\u201d\nI reached out, trying to find him in the darkness. My fingertips grazed his robes, and I let them trail down his arm until I found his left hand.\nI hesitated a moment before I slipped the cigarette out from between his fingers and brought it up to my lips.\nMy hands were shaking, and my throat caught nervously as I took a long, slow drag.\nI closed my eyes and exhaled heavily.\nI reached out and found his hand again, resting on his knee. I slowly laid my palm against the back of it. My fingertips traced lightly over his knuckles as I stared into the darkness.\nIt felt natural to sit there with him. It had become a habit, maybe even a tradition. I\u2019m not entirely certain where the line of distinction is drawn between the two.\nWe fell into it over the years.\nI was the one who\u2019d brought cigarettes the first time.\nAt some point over the years, the strange unspoken interlude between us had became the point of every event. The darkened silence and his hand under mine until my hands stopped shaking, and I could go back out to the room with the blindingly bright lights beating down and the constant camera flashes.\nBefore I left, I always said, \u201cYou should make an appearance, just for a few minutes. It\u2019ll be noticed if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe never replied, but he\u2019d show up just long enough to be photographed.\nThat was all that happened until the next event.\u00a0\nSomehow, without exchanging a word, we always found each other in the dark.\nHe could rarely leave his manor. Visitors required Ministry approval and all applications and visits were public record, as were his correspondence and his floo calls. They called it government transparency.\nI don\u2019t know how he\u2019d managed to get hold of cigarettes.\nI brought my hand up to my lips and took another long drag.\nNo matter how many Ministry events I\u2019d attended, they never felt natural. It was like re-agitating a wound and inserting needles. Every year I\u2019m angrier and more on edge until I wonder if I might just shatter under the unrelenting spotlight.\nSmoking with Malfoy for a few minutes had become the only thing that got me through.\nMy hands were trembling less when I brought the cigarette to my lips for another drag. I caught sight of his face. He was watching me carefully.\n\u201cThat bad?\u201d\nI shook my head, averting my eyes. \u201cIt\u2014it was fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d his voice was hushed. He leaned closer until I could feel his chest against my shoulder. His breath stirred my hair and I could hear the smirk in his voice. \u201c\u2014they have potions\u2014\u201d\nI elbowed him away while rolling my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t consume alcohol if I take Calming Draught or anti-anxiety potions. It\u2019s like hanging a sign over my head announcing that I have \u2018trauma\u2019.\u201d My throat tightened and my hand gripped his briefly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s watching out there\u2026\u201d\nMy hand shook again. I forced my voice to relax. \u201cBesides\u2014I promised someone a drink if he showed up.\u201d\nI quickly brought the cigarette back to my lips.\nMalfoy shifted closer. His long fingers slid up to cradle the base of my skull, and he drew our faces together.\nI stiffened until I made out the unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth.\nHe touched the tip of it against mine and paused.\nI inhaled slowly and watched his narrow features illuminate. Our faces were only inches away from each other. His eyes were dark and glittering in the dim glow.\u00a0\nThe reddish light caught in his pale hair.\nHis hand slid away, and he sat back, taking a quick drag.\n\u201cYou could have used your wand,\u201d I said when my heart stopped pounding.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try that. You\u2019re the only one I know who smokes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I put the remains of my cigarette on the step as I lifted my heel and bore down. \u201cNormally\u2014I don\u2019t.\u201d\nHis cigarette glowed as he lit another and slipped it between my fingers without a word.\nMy right hand found him in the darkness. I ran my fingers over his knuckles lightly, tapping them as though they were an instrument, and the movement drew the darkness and quiet more tightly around us.\nAfter another minute, my hand finally stilled against his.\nHe shifted, and I could hear the sound of sloshing liquid.\n\u201cAbout that drink. I brought firewhiskey\u2014but when I was moving the boxes off this staircase, I found something new.\u201d His voice was conspiratorial. \u201cI believe it\u2019s Muggle. It tastes like alcoholic pinecones.\u201d\nI was never sure if he was being serious or just trying to amuse me when he said things like that.\nI snorted. \u201cGin? It\u2019s made from Juniper berries.\u201d\nHe was silent for a moment. \u201cAh. That explains it.\u201d\nI gave a low laugh. As I was bringing my cigarette back to my lips, we were suddenly illuminated, and I could see him clearly for the first time.\nThe first time.\nWe\u2019d always stayed in the dark. We\u2019d smoke and drink and then I\u2019d leave without a wand ever being lit. I didn\u2019t know why he was suddenly changing things.\nI stared at him like a startled deer.\nHis cigarette was dangling from his lips, and his hair was tousled. He was dressed to the nines in that casual, effortless way of someone who wore their clothes rather than being worn by them. It was a distinction that I never felt as though I\u2019d managed.\nThere was nothing about him to indicate why he was there rather than in the next room with everyone else. I\u2019d assumed nerves or rage like me\u2014but as I stared at him, I didn\u2019t see any of it.\nHis eyes were glittering as he slipped his wand into my limp fingers and reached into his robes, pulling out a set of tumblers.\nHe lifted up the gin bottle beside him. \u201cLook, it even has a hat.\u201d\nHe deftly poured two fingers into a glass and handed it off.\nI stubbed out my cigarette and took the tumbler while he was pouring a glass for himself.\nHe smirked and toasted me with a lazy salute. \u201cTo all you war heroes, cheers to your bravery.\u201d\nHe plucked his cigarette from the corner of his mouth and knocked back the drink, his eyes never leaving mine.\nThis wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d come for. The comfort of darkness was a place to loosen my armour and breathe without fearing anyone was watching to catch sight of my vulnerabilities and old scars.\nNow there was light\u2014like sunlight beating down on an exposed nerve, and the illusion had faded away.\nI was sitting in a filthy service passage, smoking to ward off a panic attack, sitting beside someone that I hadn\u2019t publicly spoken to in a decade.\nIn a matter of minutes, I would reappear at the celebratory banquet. I had to be seen taking measured sips of wine and consuming dessert in a manner that gave no indication of any type of eating disorder. I had to sit with my hands in my lap and laugh on cue while refraining from picking at my fingernails.\nThen I would go home and find out from the morning paper whether I was deemed stable and coping or not.\nI brought the tumbler to my lips and took a small sip.\nMalfoy studied me carefully. \u201cYou prefer firewhiskey?\u201d\nI glanced down. \u201cCombining alcohol with tobacco increases the risk of throat cancer.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\nI took another slow sip of gin. Alcoholic pinecones. The corner of my mouth quirked. The comedic absurdity was as glaring as the light.\nI wished I\u2019d asked for firewhiskey. I could use some courage, even false courage.\nThe solace was a mistake indulge in. I could see that now, as I sat in the wandlight.\nI set the tumbler on the steps by my feet and stood, returning his wand. \u201cI should go back out before I\u2019m missed.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say a word. His eyes had contracted into indolent silver.\nI inhaled slowly until my lungs ached as I stared down at him. \u201cYou should make an appearance, just for a few minutes. It\u2019ll be noticed if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe nodded slowly. He looked so outwardly collected. There was a part of me that wanted to reach out muss him up a bit, lace my fingers into the hair at the base of his head and light a cigarette against his lips.\n\u201cGoodbye, Malfoy.\u201d\nI looked at him a moment longer, then turned and went back the way I\u2019d come.\nThe wandlight vanished before I was a dozen feet away.\nI found the wall and slid my hand along it, trying to remember the location of all the crates I\u2019d run into earlier.\nThe roar of the hall got louder when I neared the door I\u2019d left ajar when I slipped out. The chattering. People were happy. People were mourning. At that point, almost everyone was drunk, except the reporters who stayed sober and alert in order to pick up any and all potential gossip.\nMy fingers grazed the knob, and I stood hesitating, trying to brace myself for what I was about to be re-immersed in.\nEach additional year of adulthood made me a little more enraged on behalf of myself and all the other students. We were children. Every year, I\u2019m more staggered by how young we all were.\nHow was it ever seen as natural for us to be the ones fighting the war? That families had sent their children back to Hogwarts while the Carrows were there. That everyone kept their heads down when the\u00a0 Muggle-Born Registration Act was put in place.\nAs an adult, it staggers me more, how natural it seemed at the time for the war to fall on our shoulders.\nA generation of paper war heroes.\nTypecast into our roles at Sorting and now watched daily for signs of wear and tear.\nThe majority of the Wizarding world wasn\u2019t willing to lift a finger to fight the war, but they\u2019re all too eager to diagnose us with trauma from the comfort of their armchairs.\nMy hands were threatening to shake again, and I clenched them into fists for a moment before I reached to open the door.\nIt was stuck. Lodged. I glanced up and saw the dim outline of a hand, pressed against it.\nMalfoy had materialised behind me. I\u2019d barely turned before his chest pressed against mine. His hand slid down the door to my shoulder, and his fingers cradled the base of my head. There were no cigarettes between us as his face drew closer.\n\u201cHermione\u2014\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what it meant when he said my name like that. What inference or implication was intended.\nMy eyes widened as my breath caught in my throat. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\nHis lips brushed against mine.\nThen he waited.\nIt was an unspoken question.\nMy heart was pounding in my chest and my fingers were trembling as I reached out and drew him closer.\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t appear when she walks through the door. He isn\u2019t in the library or his study either.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDraco?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUp\u2014here.\u201d His voice wafts down the stairs with an indefinable quality Hermione cannot quite put her finger on.\u00a0\n\n\nShe ascends the stairs slowly, wand drawn, until she comes to his room. The door is slightly ajar.\u00a0\n\n\nShe hesitates for a moment. The odds currently stand evenly split. She\u2019ll either push it open to find him waiting for her, decoratively garbed in chocolate, or discover him held at wand-point by vengeful Death Eaters.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to ever predict anything when it comes to Draco Malfoy.\u00a0\n\n\nShe draws a deep breath and flicks her wand, swinging the door open.\u00a0\n\n\nHe is not naked.\u00a0\n\n\nOr held hostage.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead she finds him standing casually upon a precariously small side table in the middle of the room.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re here,\u201d he says as though his current location is normal.\u00a0\n\n\nShe stares at him for several moments in silence. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\nHe quirks an aristocratic eyebrow and looks down his nose at her. \u201cI do live here, last I checked. I believe the deed for this house lists me as it\u2019s possessor. I can stand wherever I want.\u201d\n\n\nHermione sighs and glances around the room. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s what?\u201d\n\n\nHermione raises an eyebrow of her own. \u201cThe spider. Where is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat spider? There\u2019s no spider. Is a man unable to stand on his own side table\u2014\u201c\n\n\nHermione rolls her eyes and casts a point-me charm, while Draco waxes eloquent on individual rights and freedom, parroting all of Hermione\u2019s favourite talking points from the many occasions when she\u2019s lectured him.\n\n\nThere is a cardinal spider lurking beneath the bookshelf.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDraco, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says as she kneels down and reaches under, gently catching it. \u201cThey\u2019re entirely harmless.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enormous.\u201d Draco sounds as though he\u2019s being strangled to death.\u00a0\n\n\nHermione stands up, and the spider scurries rapidly around her hand as she turns to face Draco again.\n\n\n\u201cOh fuck! Please don\u2019t do that again. Kill it. For god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s a spider, you\u2019re supposed to kill them. Why do you always have to let them climb on you?\u201d He buries his face in his hands, and the side table wobbles dangerously.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always let them climb on me. This kind is harmless.\u201d She flicks her wand, and the spider levitates through the air as she sends it out the open window and into a nearby tree.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAll gone and nobody died.\u201d She closes the window and looks up at him again. \u201cStill exercising your right to stand on the side table, or will you come down now?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother is speaking to me again.\u201d\nNothing.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cShe sent a note yesterday asking how I was.\u201d\nHermione was still staring absent-mindedly out of the window.\u00a0\n\u201cI wrote back\u2014and she asked if I\u2019d come to dinner this Tuesday.\u201d\nStill nothing.\u00a0\n\u201cI intend to decline unless she extends the invitation to you as well.\u201d\nThe hollow at the base of her throat dipped, and she looked at him suddenly. \u201cYou should go.\u201d\nHe stared at her. \u201cReally?\nShe nodded. \u201cYes. You should go. They\u2019re your parents.\u201d\nHis eyebrows furrowed. \u201cRight. They\u2019ve also refused to speak to me since I informed them that we\u2019re dating. Which seems like a pertinent issue.\u201d\nShe studied at him. The tines of her fork tapped lightly at the edge of her plate. \u201cWhere\u2014where do you see us in a year or so?\u201d\nDraco shifted uncomfortably at the change of subject. Hermione had very specific ideas about the pace of relationships; they should progress with grave intentionality. He\u2019d only just managed to convince her to let him have a drawer in her flat.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. If it keeps going well, maybe l\u2019ll have two drawers by then.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t appear to notice the joke. She gave a short nod and looked down at the peas on her plate as her fork chased them from one side to the other.\u00a0\n\u201cIs everything alright at work?\u201d He eyed her carefully, trying to pin down exactly what seemed off about her. She nodded without meeting his eyes.\u00a0\nShe was bothered about something, but as far as he could tell, it didn\u2019t seem directed specifically towards him.\u00a0\nWas he forgetting an important date? Not her birthday. They\u2019d been \u201cofficially\u201d in a relationship for one month and three weeks and two days. Prior to that, they\u2019d dated for five months and some odd days, which he didn\u2019t think was traditionally celebrated. No major events in November for either of them insofar as he was aware.\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t generally make him guess if he\u2019d done something to upset her. He\u2019d been an excellent boyfriend lately\u2014if he did say so himself. He hadn\u2019t even done anything to get back at Weasley for turning him into a giant canary at the excruciatingly uncomfortable \u2018Weasley Dinner\u2019 that he\u2019d attended with Hermione last Friday evening.\nShe was still chasing her peas around her plate.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHer fork stilled, but she didn\u2019t look at him immediately. The tip of her tongue darted out, and she wetted her lips before looking up.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014\u201c she started, then she froze, her mouth still ajar. She swallowed and set her fork down before squaring her shoulders.\u00a0\nShe was going to break up with him, he realised with shriveling horror.\u00a0\nNo wonder she thought he should go have dinner with his parents.\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t want him anymore. He had too much to make up for, and their relationship was interfering with and creating too many difficulties throughout her life.\u00a0\nHe felt his throat close as the blood drained from his head.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The question escaped him before he\u2019d even processed that he was forming words. He felt as though he\u2019d been bracing himself to be stabbed in the heart then instead been clocked in the head. His entire mind came to a screeching halt. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Her brown eyes met his bewildered gaze for a moment before she looked back down at her plate. \u201cI found out earlier today.\u201d\u00a0\nDraco abruptly had approximately five hundred thousand questions.\nPregnant? How was she pregnant? She was definitely, borderline religiously, taking contraceptive potions.\u00a0\nDraco had never thought about fatherhood beyond the abstract conclusion that he was not planning to be interested in it for a good long time.\u00a0\nHermione was pregnant.\u00a0\nHe stared at her dazedly.\u00a0 \u201cH-h-How?\u201d\u00a0\nHermione pressed her lips together. \u201cContraceptive potion has an efficacy of about ninety-nine point two percent. Which means there\u2019s still a point eight percent chance of getting pregnant. So if there are a hundred witches using it for a year, there can still be the possibility of a pregnancy occurring.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s you\u2026\u201d he said slowly.\u00a0\nHer nostrils flared as she inhaled. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d The base of her throat dipped and she looked down at her lap and was silent for several seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do yet. They gave me a prescription for a potion.\u201d\nDraco swallowed and resisted the urge to reach out and drain his wine glass. Despite his daze, he had a very clear sense that he\u2019d never be able to take back whatever he said next.\nAs petrified as he was at the very concept of fatherhood, he was even more terrified that he was going to misstep and break the very fragile trust he had managed to build between them.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe opened his mouth and then closed it again. He wanted to loosen his collar, but her eyes were wide and locked on him. She sat carefully watching him.\u00a0\nShe reminded him of a frightened wild rabbit. When he was growing up, there had been hundreds of them on the estate. They\u2019d freeze and watch him with their dark eyes, barely moving, ready to sprint away and vanish in an instant if threatened.\nHe inhaled and leaned forward, extending his hand. Her hands were in her lap, so he rested his fingers on the table near her.\u00a0\nHer dark, intelligent eyes grew wider as they darted between his hand and his face.\u00a0\nHe exhaled slowly.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d already been done for long before he\u2019d managed to get her to agree to even have a drink with him. Just a drink had required weeks of deliberation on her part.\u00a0\nShe\u2019d had a very long list of rules and requirements specifically engineered to keep their relationship\u2019s progress slow, and it had worked aggravatingly well during the initial few months.\u00a0\nThings had accelerated somewhat when they\u2019d agreed to tell people that they were in a relationship. Draco\u2019s parents had been incensed, and his father had threatened to disown him. The Weasleys and Potter has been about as pleased as one would expect and were unveiled in their displeasure and skepticism.\u00a0\nThe first month had not been pleasant. However, the upside of Hermione refusing to speak to Potter and Weasley for being \u201ccomplete idiots\u201d and Draco openly toeing the line of becoming a blood traitor and following in the footsteps of his aunt Andromeda, was that their social life was largely non-existent.\u00a0\nWhich\u2014now as he thought about it, probably had something to do with the situation at hand.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\nShe sucked her lower lip into her mouth, and he could see the tips of her teeth gnawing at it.\u00a0\nShe always had a plan for things. Post-war, the life of Hermione Granger was meticulously plotted out.\u00a0\nHer colour-coded calendar had evenings marked for company, for projects, for reading. They were currently having lunch on the one lunch break each week that she was available to have lunch with him. She volunteered during three out of her five of them, and another day was marked and reserved for maintaining collegial relationships with friends and coworkers.\u00a0\nShe had a one year plan, a five year plan, a ten year plan. Possibly others.\u00a0\nShe always knew exactly what to do.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like I should just know what I should do\u2014but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201c She drew a sharp breath. \u201cWe\u2014\u201c her voice wavered and faded.\u00a0\nThe corners of her mouth twitched, and her eyes moved away from his face. She was quiet for a moment. He watched her shoulders tense, and her whole body appeared to contract.\u00a0\nShe was going to keep the pregnancy. He was almost positive. She wouldn\u2019t have been so uncertain if she was instinctively leaning towards termination. She probably would have already picked up the potion.\u00a0\nShe was going to keep it, and she knew that the choice would annihilate half her plans and most of her calendar, and obliterate her intention of having their relationship indefinitely progress at the temperate speed of a sloth.\u00a0\nHer fingertips appeared at the edge of the table and slowly turned white as she gripped it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do yet\u2014but\u2014\u201cshe swallowed visibly, and her voice become tight and businesslike,\u201d\u2014obviously this wasn\u2019t in either of our plans. Our relationship is very new, and we don\u2019t have any idea of what could have happened in the long run if things hadn\u2019t been derailed like this. I wanted you to know about the pregnancy, but I don\u2019t expect or want you to think that this makes you obligated or committed in any way.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s hand twitched. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHer eyes flashed with stubborn determination. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of having a child on my own\u2014if I decide to. I don\u2019t want you\u2014staying involved with me because you have some antiquated sense of obligation and believe that you have to make honest witch of me now. I just\u2014\u201c her voice wobbled as she inhaled, \u201cI would rather know right off if you don\u2019t want to be involved\u2014it would\u2014be easier for me if we could conclude things amicably in that case.\u201d\nDraco stood up abruptly, walked around the table, and then stole a chair from a nearby table. He sat and took her by the shoulders, turning her so that he could look into her eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cHermione\u2014\u201c he said, his hands running down her tense arms.\u00a0\n\u201cHermione\u2026\u201d he said again, his hands reaching up and shaking somewhat as he captured her face. His fingertips traced her cheekbones and along her jaw.\n\u201cHermione, I am in love with you,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI was in love with you before anyone knew we were dating. I was in love with you before we slept together. I was already pretty nearly in love with you before you agreed to get a drink with me. If you keep this pregnancy, I will still be in love with you. Whatever you do\u2014for the rest of your life\u2014I\u2019m in for. Wherever you are\u2014and whatever you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s the only place I want to be. Alright?\u201d\nTabula rasa. Those are the terms.\u00a0\nGet out of Azkaban, work at her insipid house-elf charity for a year, and pretend they\u2019ve never met before.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s weird, but anything is better than sitting in Azkaban for a second year.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like a fresh start.\u00a0\nThe concept is tantalising.\nHe refrains from rolling his eyes as he agrees to the terms. \u201cI\u2019d love to act like I\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201d\n\u201cThe terms will be magically binding. Violate them, and you will return to fill the additional year of your sentence,\u201d the weevil-faced lawyer says.\u00a0\nDraco glances at his mother who sits eagerly beside him and is nodding her encouragement.\u00a0\n\u201cFine. I\u2019m legally bound act like I don\u2019t know her. Sounds ideal. Where do I sign?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know why the clause even exists in the agreement. Three weeks on the job and he hasn\u2019t even laid eyes on her.\u00a0\nThe day he arrives, he\u2019s shuffled off into a cramped office in the basement, and, after they try giving him a variety of different tasks, he ends up being assigned to write thank you letters.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s his entire job.\u00a0\nExcellent penmanship is apparently the only usable skill that he possesses.\u00a0\nHe assumes at first that it will be easy. He\u2019ll come in late, leave early, and spend a matter of minutes charming a couple dozen notes tops.\u00a0\n\u201cDear Bootlicker, Thank you terribly much for your generous donation of 500 galleons. I\u2019m thrilled there was literally nothing else you could conceive of to do with your money. It will assuredly be used by yours truly to improve the lives of the sentient abominations called house-elves. Sincerely, love and kisses, the Wizarding world\u2019s favourite buck-toothed harridan, Hermione Granger.\u201d\nNo. It\u2019s not easy. Granger has elaborate requirements for all the thank you letters that she doesn\u2019t even bother to personally write.\u00a0\nHe has to go through the society papers and Granger\u2019s detailed personal calendar to make references to the donor\u2019s last meeting with her. He\u2019s expected to ask about children and grandchildren by name and discuss the inner-workings of the charity as well as to relate anecdotes about all the sad little elves the donor\u2019s money saves.\u00a0\nWithin a few weeks, he\u2019s maintaining a full-fledged correspondence between the most bizarre assortment of Wizarding folk, a centaur, two vampires, and an alleged forest troll. A correspondence that he is maintaining as Granger, whom he hasn\u2019t laid eyes on in years.\u00a0\nSupposedly she looks over all his letters before signing them and sending them off, but Draco doubts it. After weeks there, he still hasn\u2019t so much as caught sight of her bushy head.\u00a0\nHe torn between a sense of outrage and admiration over what a slick ship she runs. Poor dear little Hermione, the Wizarding world\u2019s darling, has an entire legion of Yes-men at her beck and call, doing all the work she\u2019s allegedly achieving with her chipper can-do attitude.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t think she even shows up in her office most days. If she does, she never slips so much as a toe past the fourth floor where her office sits.\u00a0\nGranger has a matronly personal assistant the size of a mountain named Charlotte. The woman is like the female version of Crabbe and Goyle simultaneously. Draco is convinced she must be at least a quarter troll. She glares at Draco whenever \u201cpassing on messages\u201d and makes clear to Draco that she\u2019d gladly snap his spine if Granger ever gave her the go-ahead.\u00a0\nDraco accepts his \u201cjob\u201d with his head down. He just has to endure it a year and then he\u2019s free. Maybe once he\u2019s not at risk of returning to Azkaban, he can expose what a fraud Granger and her charity are.\u00a0\nHe finally sees Granger after two months.\nShe\u2019s walking by with her assistant when he\u2019s standing in the hallway, taking a break from his cramped office\u2019s inadequate air flow.\u00a0\nGranger catches sight of him all the way down the hallway and without hesitating, bolts down the hallway to him.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019ve been here for over a month, and I haven\u2019t said hi.\u201d She\u2019s beaming at him as she takes hold of his hand and shakes enthusiastically. Her assistant comes thundering down the hall after her. \u201cI\u2019ve been admiring your penmanship for weeks. I\u2019m Hermione Granger, and you must be Draco Malfoy. I\u2019m so pleased we could have you on the team here.\u201d\nDraco stared at her blankly while she pumps his hand up and down.\u00a0\nTabula rasa.\u00a0\nEveryone at the charity knows who he is, even though they make a show of not. There are loud comments about the kinds of people who would become Death Eaters. The receptionist pretends to be unable to recall his name or that he has a job there. Draco is obliged to go through the full sign-in process every morning as though he\u2019s a visitor.\u00a0\nHowever, Granger has no idea who he is. It\u2019s not an act. There is not even a flicker of recognition in her eyes as she grins up at him.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s imagined their fake \u201cmeeting\u201d a dozen different ways, but this iteration isn\u2019t one that\u2019s ever occurred to him.\u00a0\n\u201cGranger,\u201d he says as she continues wringing his hand. Charlotte is ten feet away, her footsteps shaking the hall, and her eyes are threatening a slow and painful death. \u201cIt\u2019s been a\u2014pleasure?\u201d\n\u201cMiss Granger, you have a meeting with Gibbling to review charity finances in five minutes,\u201d Charlotte says as she reaches Granger, trying to tear her away from Draco.\n\u201cI do?\u201d Granger\u2019s hand slips out of Draco\u2019s, and she looks chastened, as though she\u2019s been slapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI apologise, ma\u2019am,\u201d the assistant says smoothly, inserting herself between Granger and Draco. \u201cIt slipped my mind, I only just remembered he sent a note this morning. I\u2019m sure it will only take a few minutes.\u201d\nGranger is craning her neck to look back at Draco as she\u2019s being herded away. She side-steps her assistant and cuts back.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Draco. I\u2019m having a little party at my flat this Saturday with some of my friends. Would you want to come by? It\u2019s the least I can do after being so rude.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Draco glances back and forth between Granger\u2019s hopeful face and the venomous expression of Charlotte behind her, who is shaking her head warningly. \u201c\u2014don\u2019t think I can make it?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see each other again.\u201d\nDraco watches Granger trot off with her assistant in tow feeling incredibly confused about what\u2019s going on.\u00a0\nHe feels like if anyone were going to tell him, they would have already done so. He\u2019s legally bound to play along with whatever this ridiculous farce is.\u00a0\nHis mother has to know, but her lips are apparently sealed on the matter.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of Azkaban, darling. Focus on that and leave everything else alone.\u201d\nHe wants to, but he can\u2019t help but try to figure it out. Why doesn\u2019t Granger remember him? It feels like he\u2019s been personally and exclusively excised from her life, and he hasn\u2019t the foggiest idea why he was the only one singled out.\u00a0\nGranger still knows his mother. She's still an active participant post-war rebuilding and gives speeches from time to time about things like the Battle of Hogwarts.\u00a0\nShe isn\u2019t the type to fuck with her memory based on anything and everything Draco knows about her. If she were, he doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d choose to forget him. And if she did choose to forget him, he doesn\u2019t know why her weird melange of employees and friends would let her hire him.\u00a0\nIt feels personal, and he can\u2019t bring himself to leave it alone. Is there anything else she doesn\u2019t remember?\u00a0\nWhen he isn\u2019t ghost-writing her correspondence, he starts going through the newspapers and her old calendars trying to pinpoint exactly when Granger may have forgotten his existence.\nHe thinks it happened about six months after he was imprisoned in Azkaban following the war. Granger\u2019s exhaustively detailed calendars start immediately after that, and her public appearances were sporadic and odd up until then.\nHe starts hanging around in hallways when he thinks he might run into her. Her assistant is always a few steps behind her, glaring at Draco as though she knows why he\u2019s there and inventing meetings and events in order to get Granger away from him.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s been there four months and has barely spoken to her for more than ten minutes in the entire time.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s in the middle of writing a sarcastically cordial letter to Romanian vampire when his office door cracks open and Granger sneaks into his office.\u00a0\nHe looks at her as she drops into the chair across from his desk and lets out a heavy sigh of relief.\u00a0\nDraco eyes the door, waiting for Charlotte to burst in like a raging erumpant.\u00a0\nGranger notices where his gaze is directed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I sent Lotte on an errand. We have at least fifteen minutes before she comes looking for me.\u201d\nDraco looks back to Granger. He doesn\u2019t know what to make of her.\u00a0\nThis version of Granger is weirdly cheerful, like all her prickly defensiveness has been smoothed away. She still looks frightful, as though she suffers a phobia of hair potion, she\u2019s still bizarre and obsessed with things like saving house-elves and everything else in the world. But he feels like she\u2019s an entirely different person around him.\nMaybe he\u2019d just never known her without her claws out.\u00a0\nGranger shifts and looks slightly uncomfortable. \u201cShe\u2019s very protective of me. I\u2014I lose track of things sometimes.\u201d\nDraco just nods, not really sure how anyone who keeps records of their daily activities as exhaustively as Granger does could possibly be accused of losing track of things.\u00a0\nShe glances around his office. \u201cWhy on earth did they put you in here? This room looks like a storage closet.\u201d\nDraco refrains from telling her that it literally is a storage closet and the absolute furthest room from her office. He measured one day, just to confirm it to himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m not picky,\u201d he lies. \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable than Azkaban.\u201d\nHer mouth purses. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly a commendation. I\u2019ll have you moved upstairs. I\u2019m sure we still have a few extra offices. Somewhere with a window and plants! My friend, Neville, is a genius with plants. Once we\u2019ve moved you, I can get a few.\u201d\nShe pokes around in his office for a few more minutes, interrogating him about how he likes his job and how his \u201cco-workers\u201d are treating him. Draco lies his way through her questioning until she stands up looking at him thoughtfully.\u00a0\nThe next day, Charlotte appears looking enraged while he\u2019s at the front desk filling out the visitor sheet for the hundredth time.\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger wants your office moved to the fourth floor,\u201d she says, looking as though someone has force-fed her a lemon.\nDraco\u2019s new office is two doors down from Granger\u2019s. He has an entire wall of windows.\u00a0\nGranger pops in relentlessly, bringing him plants and knitted tea-cosy, and \u201cLotte\u201d looks more and more as though she wants to throttle him.\u00a0\nGranger takes to sneaking into his office whenever Lotte is out running errands. Which seems to occur suspiciously often.\nDraco is certain that Granger\u2019s aware that there is something odd going on. Her eyes are sly and calculating. She knows she\u2019s being \u201chandled\u201d, and that it involves endless attempts by all her employees to keep her as far away from Draco as possible, which makes her obstinately seek him out all the more.\nAt first Draco tries to ignore her, but she is his boss. He feels obligated to talk to her whenever she shows up.\u00a0\nEventually they talk about all the letters he\u2019s writing on her behalf. She looks down at her lap and spends several seconds straightening her skirt.\u00a0\n\u201cYou must think it\u2019s odd that I don\u2019t keep up with the donors personally,\u201d she says, looking up at him.\u00a0\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he lies. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s common for charities of this size. I\u2019m happy my handwriting can be of some use.\u201d\n\u201cI used to\u2014\u201c she says, her voice somewhat halting. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c her head jerks slightly, \u201cmy\u2014my memory can be rather\u2014that\u2019s why I keep so many notes in my calendars, to keep track.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer expression is visibly strained, her beaming effusiveness gone.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very busy person,\u201d he says, eyeing her carefully.\u00a0\nShe gives a stiff little nod and her eyebrows furrow. \u201cI think\u2014I used to remember things better. Now, if I don\u2019t have someone to remind me about things\u2026 sometimes\u201d\u2014her head jerks\u2014\u201cI forget details.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just stress.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she sounds unconvinced.\u00a0\nShe has all the traditional symptoms of someone who\u2019s been extensively and powerfully obliviated. Absent-mindedness. She\u2019s chronically forgetful, Draco realises over time.\u00a0\nCharlotte does invent appointments to get Granger away from Draco, but almost as many reminders are for real events that Hermione forgets she\u2019s headed to. On several occasions, Draco finds her standing alone in the hallway, trying to remember which door is her office.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s still smart. Still blisteringly smart, but it\u2019s like watching a bird with its pinions clipped. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s intended to be airborne, but someone has hobbled her.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s painful to witness, and it\u2019s made worse by the fact that she\u2019s clearly aware of it.\u00a0\nThe memory loss somehow seems to centre around Draco, which he cannot understand. If someone malicious were to go and wipe something from her memory, her best friend\u2019s school rival is not the person Draco would pick.\u00a0\nObliviation is self-protective. The mind will not consider the idea of tampering or let her realise her memories are incomplete. Whenever a conversation strays anywhere near their shared past, her attention abruptly, almost violently pivots to a different topic.\nHowever, despite how obstinately her memory keeps her from suspecting any past acquaintance with Draco, she can\u2019t seem to stay away from him. As though she can instinctively tell he\u2019s a missing piece.\nOne day she tells him about a potion idea she has, and it\u2019s almost brilliant except she\u2019s clearly forgotten a brewing idiosyncrasy of a key ingredient. She realises she\u2019s missed something and just comes to a rambling halt in the middle of her explanation, a drawn, embarrassed expression sweeping across her face.\u00a0\n\u201cNever mind. I think\u2014I should...maybe it will work out if I write it down\u2014\u201c she looks down and her cheeks are stained scarlet.\u00a0\n\u201cSting slime needs to simmer for six hours uncovered,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you want the potion to result in weightlessness.\u201d\nShe stares at him for a moment and then her face breaks into a smile. \u201cYes! Six hours of simmering. That\u2019s when you leave it under the full moon and gather fresh asphodel.\u201d She sighs with relief and presses a hand against her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was missing. I thought\u2014thank you, Draco. I thought\u2014I thought maybe I\u2019d gotten it all wrong again.\u201d\nHer exuberance causes Draco\u2019s entire body to grow warm and a weird bubbling sensation in his stomach.\u00a0\nHe avoids her eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t brewed much since leaving prison, but everything else sounded correct. If you want to send it on to a potions journal, I can look it over if you ever write it all out.\u201d\nHer eyes are shining, and she beams at him. \u201cThat would be so helpful. My friends didn\u2019t really care much for potions class. I\u2019m so glad I found you.\u201d\nShe skips slightly as she leaves his office which causes his entire face to twitch repeatedly as he witnesses it.\u00a0\nGranger spends increasing amounts of time in his office, and Draco doesn\u2019t\u2014well, he doesn\u2019t exactly mind.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s infinitely better company than dementors, he tells himself.\nShe incredibly interested in him, in a way that he has no idea how to handle. She wants to know what he\u2019ll do once his contract with the charity is over, and he finds himself trying to come up with ideas to share with her that don\u2019t don\u2019t merely involve him indolently frittering away his time on his family\u2019s properties.\nIt isn\u2019t as though he\u2019s not allowed to be friends with her. The terms of his contract simply require him to give no indication of any prior acquaintance with her.\u00a0\nThey can be friends, he tells himself when she invites herself into his office to have lunch with him.\u00a0\nGood friends even, he reasons, when she invites him to her flat for dinner one evening.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the contract that restricts them from being more than friends. He\u2019s certain of it. He\u2019s checked and rechecked.\u00a0\nHermione is perched on the arm of his desk chair.\nTheir faces are getting slowly closer and closer until he can feel her nervous breathing. She has the most beautiful eyes. Her hair falls forward as his nose brushes against her.\u00a0\nHis hand ventures up until his fingertips trace along her cheek.\u00a0\nShe smiles. Her eyes smile and the corner of her mouth curves faintly up as she dips her head lower.\u00a0\nTheir lips are almost touching when the door bursts open and Charlotte storms across the room.\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger is supposed to be at a board meeting,\u201d she says as she rushes Hermione away.\u00a0\nDraco has barely gotten his heart rate back down to a steady pace when Charlotte returns in a state of seething rage. She grips him by the robes and physically drags him from the building.\n\u201cYou\u2019re contagiously ill. Bed-ridden. I don\u2019t want to see you set foot in this building for a month,\u201d she says, glowering at him. \u201cStay away from her, you Death Eater bastard.\u201d\u00a0\nDraco goes home sulkily. His mother is in France visiting a cousin and he has nothing to do but lie about indolently drinking.\u00a0\nThe attempted separation goes as well as Draco expects. Charlotte may be obsessively loyal to Hermione, but she clearly didn\u2019t think through what sending Draco home sick would result in.\u00a0\nHermione shows up at Malfoy Manor through the floo after three days. Draco has to bolt through the manor and dives into bed mere seconds before she comes trotting into his bedroom, carrying a basket packed with soup and potions.\u00a0\nShe fusses over him for several minutes while he lies and pretends to be languishing. Finally she sits down, looking endearingly awkward, and starts updating him on the various going ons at the charity.\u00a0\nAs the minutes tick by, Draco can\u2019t help but develop a sense of unease. There\u2019s something off about her.\nHer eyes begin darting around. She speaks faster and faster.\u00a0 Her hand rises up and touches her throat before twitching up to her temple. Her head jerks.\u00a0\nIt finally dawns on Draco why she doesn\u2019t remember him.\u00a0\nShe breaks off mid-sentence, her eyes darting around wildly.\n\u201cDraco\u2014have I\u2014have I\u2014been here before?\u201d\u00a0\nDraco sits up instantly and reaches for her, trying to keep his voice steady. \u201cHermione. Hermione, look at me. Focus on me. You were telling me about the elves that came to you yesterday. Don\u2019t look around. Focus on the elves. Let's get you back to the office. I\u2019m feeling better. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t seem to hear him.\u00a0\nShe glances up and catches sight of the chandelier hanging from the ceiling. A whimpering gasp escapes her, and she falls backwards off her chair.\u00a0\nDraco lunges, but she stumbles to her feet and skitters away from him.\u00a0\nHer head starts jerking violently.\u00a0\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t! We didn\u2019t\u2014\u201c\u00a0\nHer voice breaks off with a sob.\nHer face is turning white, and her eyes lock on his. Her voice drops into a ragged, pleading whisper that pulls up memories that Draco has tried to bury in depths of his mind. \u201cPlease\u2026 Malfoy... Malfoy\u2026please\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nHer head jerks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t! We found it\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nShe starts screaming at the top of her lungs.\nIt\u2019s one endless scream that vibrates and tears the air apart. Draco doesn\u2019t know what to do. Hermione keeps screaming until her whole body starts shaking violently.\u00a0\nHer voice abruptly cuts off, and she drops to the ground.\u00a0\nDraco has to leap to catch her.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s shaking with panic and seething with rage as he carries her downstairs and through the floo to St Mungo\u2019s.\u00a0\nHe nearly decks Potter when he and Weasley come bolting down the hallway into the Janus Thickey Ward.\u00a0\nDraco wants to murder them both. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have bothered to explain that the reason she doesn\u2019t remember me is because you obliviated her entire memory of Malfoy Manor?\u201d\nThey just shove him out of the way as they rush into her room and leave him waiting outside.\nPotter is the first one to re-emerge, more than an hour later. He stands staring at Draco for a minute. \u201cShe\u2019ll\u2014she should be fine,\u201d he says in a dull voice. \u201cThe mind-healers will just have to reseal the memories.\u201d\nDraco glares at him. He\u2019s still shaking. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s stopped shaking the entire time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone just tell me why she didn\u2019t remember me? Why the fuck did you obliviate her at all? Do know what you\u2019ve done to her mind?\u201d\u00a0\nPotter\u2019s expression turns deadly. \u201cDo I know what I\u2019ve done to her? Why do you think it happened, Malfoy? Did it never cross your mind that there might be long term consequences for telling your insane aunt that Hermione was Muggle-born.\u201d\u00a0\nPotter\u2019s face starts turning white with rage. \u201cIf you want to know whose fault this is\u2014try looking in a fucking mirror.\u201d\nDraco stares at Potter in blank horror.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you think people just get over torture? Since the war, St Mungo\u2019s has discovered there\u2019s an entire spectrum of brain damage that the cruciatus can cause, prior to reaching the point of insanity. Your aunt didn\u2019t torture Hermione to insanity, but just\u2014barely. We thought she was fine. The first couple months afterward\u2014she seemed fine. She started having neurological issues a few months after the war. When she got them checked here at St Mungo\u2019s, they found out the cruciatus had fried parts of her brain. That\u2019s\u2014apparently that\u2019s how it works.\u201d\u00a0\nPotter pulls off his glasses and wipes them. He refuses to look at Draco. \u201cThe only way they could contain it was by walling off the damage with magic, by using targeted obliviation. So\u2014that\u2019s what we did. It was just coincidental that she forgot entirely about you. I guess, for her, you were just as much a part of it as your Aunt.\u201d\nDraco stares at Potter and doesn\u2019t know what emotions he\u2019s experiencing. A lot. An entire maelstrom. More emotions than he knew he had. More than he ever wanted to feel.\n\u201cWhy\u2014Why did you let her hire me?\u201d he finally forces himself to ask.\u00a0\nPotter\u2019s face hardens. \u201cThat\u2014was your mum\u2019s meddling. Your release was conditional on your ability to secure a job. To the surprise of no one, no one wanted to hire you.\u201d He scoffs and looks down, his voice becomes mocking. \u201cShe\u2019ll do anything to protect her son. She\u2019d heard Hermione didn\u2019t remember you, so she went to her with a whole sob story about her poor son who\u2019d been forced to take the Dark Mark before he was an adult and now he was rotting in Azkaban because no one would give him a chance.\u201d\u00a0\nPotter stares bitterly at him. \u201cHermione can never say no to a lost cause.\u201d He gives an empty laugh. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t explain to her why she shouldn\u2019t without endangering her. We thought if you and your mother were both magically gagged, and Hermione was kept away from you, that it would be doable. But of course she noticed how lonely you were and decided to take you under her wing.\u201d\nPotter exhales slowly and swallows. \u201cStay away from her, Malfoy.\u201d His voice wobbles slightly. \u201cThe healers say you and your house are her main triggers. If you hang around her, she will inevitably relapse again. Every time they have to re-obliviate her, it\u2019s going to carve away a little more of her mind and memories. If there\u2019s even a shred of anything decent about you, stay away from her.\u201d\nDraco manages to nod once before turning and walking unsteadily away.\u00a0\nWhen he\u2019s home, he floo-calls his mother and yells at her until his throat gives out.\u00a0\nHe packs a bag and gets a cheap room in Diagon Alley. It smells and there\u2019s noise from the bar below, but it\u2019s not screaming. There are no chandeliers.\u00a0\nHe returns to \u201cwork\u201d after a month and is informed that his office has been moved back into the basement. He doesn\u2019t even blink at the news.\u00a0\nHe resumes corresponding with Hermione\u2019s growing donor list.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t see her again.\u00a0\nCharlotte no longer bothers with passing on messages personally in order to communicate her utter loathing of him. She doesn\u2019t ever leave Hermione\u2019s side.\nDraco only has to work at the charity for two more months. He puts up a calendar and X\u2019s off each day.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s walking back from his lunch break two weeks later when he catches sight of Hermione\u2019s bushy hair all the way down the hall. He ducks quickly into a nearby closet and waits until he\u2019s certain she\u2019s gone.\u00a0\nHe nearly crashes into her as he steps back out.\u00a0\nHer eyes are bright and she\u2019s slightly breathless from running. Charlotte is thundering down the hall after her.\u00a0\nHermione beams up at him as she sticks out her hand. \u201cHi! Hi, I\u2019m so so sorry. You\u2019ve been here for months and I haven\u2019t even said hello. I\u2019m Hermione Granger, and you must be Draco Malfoy. I\u2019m so pleased we could have you on the team here.\u201d\nDraco stares down at her.\u00a0\nThere is not even a flicker of recognition in her eyes as she smiles up at him.\u00a0\nHis throat tightens until it's like being strangled to death. His heart is beating itself to death inside his chest.\u00a0\nA second year in Azkaban would have been infinitely less painful than this.\u00a0\nHe sneers down at the proffered hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I just washed my hands. I don\u2019t want filth like you sliming them up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave I ever told you about your eyes?\u201d\nThere was a long sigh.\n\u201cYes. Several times now.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re so brown\u2026 Chocolate with honey. Pure amber in the sunlight. They light up as though they have stars in them when you\u2019re happy.\u201d Draco gave a long deep sigh. \u201cI love them. Adore them, really. I would kill a man for your eyes.\u201d\n\u201cYes. You mentioned that earlier when I came to get you from the bar.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your hair\u2014\u201c he caught hold of a lamp post with one hand and proceeded to swing around and around it. \u201cI used to think it was hideous. Like a doxy nest. Sometimes\u201d\u2014his voice dropped into a stage whisper so loud it bounced off the buildings\u2014\u201cI think it\u2019s sentient.\u201d\nHe twirled around the lamp post again before straightening unsteadily.\n\u201cBut your hair has grown on me too. Pucey made a comment about it last week, and I hexed that bastard so hard his descendants will have boils.\u201d He sneered for a moment before his expression transformed into a smug smile.\n\u201cTeach that fucking tosser to say a word about my girlfriend.\u201d He gave a deep bow from the waist and nearly face-planted into the pavement.\nHermione caught him by his scarf and straightened him, gripping him by the waist.\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure you felt very chivalrous.\u201d Her voice was dry.\nHe nodded heavily, wrapping his arm tightly around her shoulders and drawing himself up. \u201cI am a gentleman.\u201d\nThere was a pause.\n\u201cI try\u2014to be a gentleman.\u201d His voice wobbled.\nShe looked up sharply and found him staring down at her, his eyes were large and luminous, and beginning to swim. His jaw was trembling.\n\u201cGod\u2014Granger\u2014\u201c his voice cracked, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I did at school\u2014how I treated you\u2014I know you\u2019ll probably never be able to forgive me\u2014\u201c\nShe cut him off abruptly. \u201cWhat do you think of my ears?\u201d\nHe blinked, looking confused and sidetracked. \u201cYour\u2014ears?\u201d\n\u201cYes. What do you think of them?\u201d She walked him rapidly down the street while speaking. \u201cI wonder if maybe they\u2019re a bit too big.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Your ears are perfect. Like\u2014little pink seashells. But\u2026\u201d his voice was loudly conspiratorial, \u201cmy favourite thing about you,\u201d he was getting louder with every word as they turned the corner, \u201cdespite how much I love your eyes and ears, are the little noises you make when I lick your cu\u2014\u201c\nShe clamped her hand firmly over his mouth and held it there until his jaw stopped moving. She glared at him as she pulled her hand away.\n\u201cWill you keep quiet, you imbecile?\u201d Her face was visibly scarlet even in the moonlight.\n\u201cRude,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cRude. Rude.\u201d\nHe pulled away from her sulkily, walking over to a wall and proceeding to slide down it and sit on the damp pavement, his eyes closing.\nHermione groaned and shook him, trying to pull him to his feet. \u201cNo, no, no stay with me. Don\u2019t close your eyes.\u201c\n\u201cLeave me alone, witch. I\u2019m taken,\u201d he said. His voice was deeply slurred and he slumped down further.\nHermione started to reach into her jacket but paused and glanced over her shoulder. A matronly woman was peering disapprovingly at them through the curtains of her house. Hermione withdrew her hand with a sigh.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d She grunted and nearly fell backwards as she dragged him up off the ground.\nHis head lolled forward and he leaned heavily against her, nearly folding her over as she stumbled down the street past three more townhouses and then laboriously dragged him up the steps to the front door.\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d Her voice was breathless as she dug out a key and they fell through the doorway.\nShe lay panting for several seconds and then rolled him out of the way and kicked the door closed before drawing her wand. She flicked it and carefully levitated his limp body up the stairs and into the bedroom. Pulling back the comforter, she dropped him down onto the bed, pulled off his shoes, slipped his tie off, and tucked him carefully in.\nShe went to the bathroom to brush her teeth and change into pyjamas before crawling in beside him, curling up against his shoulder. His arm immediately shifted and wrapped around her.\nShe lifted her head, resting her hand on his chest as she kissed him chastely on the lips.\nDraco\u2019s eyes instantly popped open and he withdrew his arm with a jerk, nearly toppling off the bed.\nHermione sat up and watched as he quickly sat up, snatching up his pillow and holding it against his chest as he stood. He glanced around the bedroom and hurried over to the rug on the far side. He looked up and down the floor and finally dropped the pillow in one corner and proceeded to lie down there, bunching the pillow under his head and closing his eyes.\nHermione stared at him for several seconds before finally speaking. \u201cDraco\u2026 what are you doing? Come back to bed. Aren\u2019t you going to sleep with me?\u201d\nHis eyes opened and he looked at her blearily from across the room. He shook his head so firmly his shoulders swung with each movement. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a very nice person, but I have a girlfriend. I\u2019m not fucking it up. Not for anyone.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes again and went to sleep.\n\n  \n\nThe bed shifted and Hermione felt Draco jerk awake, his arm tightening around her waist for an instant before he froze and relaxed. He buried his face in her hair, pulling her closer.\nThere was a pause, and she thought he might stay, but after a minute his hand slid away, and she felt the bed shift when he got up silently and vanished from the room.\nShe was still awake when the room grew slightly colder and he reappeared half an hour later, slipping carefully back into bed. She turned her head and he froze, his silver eyes staring guiltily at her.\n\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d\nShe shook her head as she rolled over, pulling him back under to bedding and burrowing against his chest. The porcelain of his prosthetic was almost ice-cold from the night air. She breathed in against his robes. He smelled like the forest and the sea.\nNo Dark Magic.\n\u201cAre we safe?\u201d she asked.\nHe pulled her possessively closer, his arms entwining around her back, and her head tucked under his chin. \u201cWe\u2019re safe.\u201d\nThere was a pause.\n\u201cI just wanted to check.\u201d His voice was subdued.\nShe nodded against his chest and wrapped her arms around him, breathing slowly. \u201cWe\u2019re safe.\u201d\nShe tilted her head back and rested her fingertips on his face. The silver of his eyes caught the dim light of their room as he looked at her. His skin was cool to touch, it had probably been freezing to apparate around the island to check the wards.\nShe pressed her palm against his cheek to warm him and shifted up, closing her eyes as her lips met his. She kissed him slowly, and then once more as her fingers ran through his hair.\n\u201cWe\u2019re safe,\u201d she said again, her mouth brushing against his. Then she pulled him closer still.\n\u201cI still think about you when I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Draco said, staring wistfully at Hermione\u2019s slender back as she pointedly ignored him, digging further into a drawer of files in the dusty records room where he\u2019d risked approaching her.\n\nShe froze for several seconds before turning her head enough to glare over her shoulder at him. Her face was screwed up with disgust. \u201cEw.\u201d\n\n\nHe stared at her blankly for a moment before choking.\n\n\n\u201cNo! Not like that. I mean\u2014\u201c he felt heat staining his cheeks \u201c\u2014maybe sometimes like that\u2014\u201c\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes and turned back to the filing cabinet.\n\n\n\u201cI mean\u2014I think about you. About the things we used to talk about. When you took me to the Muggle museums, going ice skating, visiting the aquarium, that cramped bookshop in Paris\u2026\u201d\n\n\nShe turned sharply, her arms full of files. Her face expressed a deep, arctic loathing that chilled him to his bones. \u201cYes. It was fun, our secret relationship that you were so careful to restrict to Muggle world where no one would see us. I\u2019m glad to hear you enjoyed it so much.\u201d\n\n\nShe marched past him, her sensible oxford heels clicking sharply with each step.\n\n\nHis stomach clenched despairingly as he turned and trailed after her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was exactly like that,\u201d she said, her voice acidic.\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nShe stopped and stared at him, her eyes burning and dangerous. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid, Draco?\u201d She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for what, sixteen years? At any point during that time have I given you reason to believe my judgement is impaired and my sense of reason questionable?\u201d\n\n\nShe stepped towards him, and Draco\u2019s heart rate shot up until the blood was roaring in his ears. She was right there, close enough to touch for the first time in weeks.\n\n\n\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d She flashed an insincere smile. \u201cI really want to know.\u201d\n\n\nDraco swallowed thickly and decided it was a good day to die. \u201cWell, there was one time.\u201d\n\n\nHermione\u2019s expression grew murderous.\n\n\nHe raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou dated an ex-felon for several months and didn\u2019t seem to think it was going to have any repercussions on your Ministry career if people knew.\u201d\n\n\nShe stared at him, her face turning white.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. You. Dare!\u201d Her voice was forceful and enraged. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to pretend you were doing it for me. I didn\u2019t ask you to protect me. I don\u2019t need anyone to protect me. I didn\u2019t want to hide it! Don\u2019t you dare try to twist it and pretend you were doing it as a favour to me.\u201d Her chest jerked as though she were fighting back tears.\n\n\n\u201cI swear to god, that\u2019s why.\u201d He reached towards her, and she recoiled, evading his touch.\n\n\nHer eyes were swimming, but her expression was venomous. \u201cRight, now you\u2019re here to lure me back into this relationship that was so harmful for me because, what? You care so much about my reputation but can\u2019t help yourself?\u201d Her face twisted into an eerily familiar sneer. \u201cGo find yourself a stupider witch, Malfoy. I\u2019m too busy with my incredibly important reputation and Ministry career to have time to listen you try to spin your way out of this and make it my fault.\u201d\n\n\nShe pivoted and started walking rapidly away.\n\n\nDraco stood staring after her, his heart dropping. He should have just stayed away. All he\u2019d managed to do was make it worse.\n\n\nHe should just go. Go away and leave her alone the way she\u2019d made it abundantly clear that she wanted him to.\n\n\n\u201cHermione\u2026\u201d He was following her again as though she were a siren.\n\n\nHer footsteps sped up.\n\n\nHe clenched his jaw and walked faster. He caught up with her as she turned the corner, catching her by the shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She looked to be a split-second from kicking him in the shins.\n\n\nHe gripped her more tightly, leaning towards her longingly, his mouth dry. \u201cWait. Just let me explain once and I\u2019ll never bother you again, you have my word, I\u2019ll even make a vow if you want.\u201d\n\n\nShe stared at him, her expression glacial. Several people in the hall glanced towards them and Draco instantly withdrew his hand and straightened.\n\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes flashed with hurt. Draco swallowed and averted his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask you out,\u201d he said, staring over her shoulder at a potted plant. \u201cI never intended to. I assumed I\u2019d get over it. But when you asked me, well,\u201d he gave a pained smile, \u201cI\u2019m a spoiled only-child who\u2019s always been selfish, of course I said yes. I assumed we wouldn\u2019t last long and it\u2019d be fine to let it run its course. I thought as long as I didn\u2019t do anything to fuck up your life, I wouldn\u2019t be doing any harm. I didn\u2019t realise you\u2019d think I was trying to keep you hidden as though you were some kind of indiscretion on my part. I am sorry. I should have said no from the beginning.\u201d He swallowed and almost reached out at touched her.\n\n\nHe curled his hand into a fist. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to get you back, I just wanted you to know it wasn\u2019t you. It was never you. You were perfect. I\u2019m sorry you thought it was. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019d already fucked over my future before I fell for you.\u201d He inhaled and stepped back. \u201cI wish you all the best, Granger. You deserve it.\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded shortly and moved past her, feeling like he was going to be sick.\n\n\nHe never wanted to be honest with anyone ever again. He\u2019d rather be crucio\u2019d. Or by shot by one of those wooden and metal Muggle things. Muskets, he thought they were called.\n\n\nHe needed a drink. Fuck. He\u2019d prefer a coma.\n\n\nNow he had to walk all the way of goddamned Ministry pretending he hadn\u2019t just ripped his heart out and left it with a witch who didn\u2019t even want it.\n\n\nThe pounding rush in his ears was beginning to transform into a migraine.\n\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy, stop right where you are!\u201d Hermione\u2019s voice cut through the suffocating fog in his head like the crack of a whip.\n\n\nHe froze and turned reluctantly to face her.\n\n\nHer files no longer in her arms. They were laying in a pile in the middle of the floor. She was walking towards him, her face pale.\n\n\nThere were a number of people staring openly now. Draco swallowed.\n\n\nShe inhaled jerkily as she got close. \u201cYou\u2014\u201c she started, her voice unsteady. \u201cYou are the biggest idiot I have ever met, and that\u2019s really saying something considering how many idiots I know.\u201d\n\n\nOh joy. He was going to be verbally masticated by her in a public hallway. Top off their breakup. This day could not get worse.\n\n\nShe stood in front of him, hands on her hips, her eyes burning with indignation. \u201cI have never cared about what wagging tongues had to say about me, and I don\u2019t have any intention of starting to care now.\u201d\n\n\nBefore Draco could finish processing the statement, she took hold of his robes, jerked him forcefully forward, and kissed him right in the middle of the Ministry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco felt a chill in the pit of his stomach. She was humming.\nThat was always an unfortunate sign.\nTo anyone passing it might seem cheerful, but to those who knew Hermione Granger intimately, humming was a warning. Draco immediately moved closer as they reached the street corner, casting a discrete tracing charm on her coat before taking her hand.\nShe looked up at him, her dark eyes alight. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave the Ministry.\u201d\nDraco stared down at her, arching an eyebrow. \u201cAre you?\u201d\nShe nodded and raised her hand, gesturing forward into the distance. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while now. I need to stop thinking and just do it. I\u2019m not going to make the difference I want if I just stay where I am now. I need to travel and see things for myself rather than always reading about them.\u201d\nDraco tucked her hand securely in the crook of his arm, resting his fingers on top of hers.\n\u201cI thought you liked reading,\u201d he said, his voice dry.\nShe laughed and rolled her eyes. \u201cI do, but there are certain things you can\u2019t get from books. The theory isn\u2019t enough for some things; I need to experience them.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Draco nodded, but his tone had become muted.\nHermione nodded resolutely to herself, expression steely and determined. \u201cI\u2019m really going to do it. I\u2019m going to quit. I think it\u2019s important that I do. I\u2019ll travel, maybe for years.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s stomach plummeted.\n\u201cHarry and Ron can\u2019t assume I\u2019ll always be right here to bail them out. I think it\u2019s time.\u201d\nThere was a hollow, throbbing sensation spreading steadily throughout his chest, but he forced a pained smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d\nShe smiled brightly accompanied by a quick enthusiastic nod. \u201cI will.\u201d\nShe gave another hum and apparated without warning.\nThe first time Draco arrived at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, while Hermione was getting her coat, Potter pulled him aside.\nDraco braced himself for threats of dismemberment, but Potter just said, \u201cDon\u2019t let Hermione get drunk.\u201d\nDraco assumed it was some kind of protective warning, that Potter suspected Draco would try to take advantage of her if she were vulnerable and intoxicated.\nDraco had no intention of ever cutting any corners. He barely paid attention to the warning and eventually forgot about it entirely after the first few months until an attentive waiter kept their wine glasses full for several hours straight. Hermione gave a loud and abrupt peal of laughter in response to an only mildly humorous joke and it occurred to Draco that she might have had a bit more to drink than usual.\nHowever, she seemed fine. Her speech was unslurred; her eyes attentive and bright, brighter than usual perhaps. Her hands moved more emphatically when she spoke, but she didn\u2019t seem drunk.\nUntil they were leaving.\nShe gave a little happy hum and apparated without any warning.\nDraco had barely managed to grab hold of her sleeve and nearly splinched himself when they reappeared in an animal shelter. He\u2019d stood by, nauseous and bewildered, as Hermione hurried over and began removing cats from their cages, stuffing them inside her coat.\nBy the time Draco managed to get her home, they were both holding cats, covered in scratches, and Hermione was crying and kissing a resistant tomcat while talking about how animals just needed someone to love them.\nPotter wore the piercing expression of a disappointed parent as he held the door open and Draco dragged her inside.\nWhen Draco had her safely in bed with all her new cats, he tried to explain. Potter snorted and said, \u201cAt least she didn\u2019t jump you to Northern Ireland. Ron lost his elbow once chasing her.\u201d\nPotter pulled him into the kitchen to help heal the nastier scratches\n\u201dI probably should have mentioned. Hermione doesn\u2019t really have impulse control when she\u2019s drunk,\u201d Potter said as he dabbed stinging antiseptic along the side of Draco\u2019s neck.\nDraco glared as he clenched his teeth. \u201cIt would have been helpful if you had.\u201d\nPotter gave a thin smile and spelled the cut closed. \u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t think you two would last long enough that it mattered.\u201d\nDraco looked away.\n\u201cCats are pretty minor, relatively speaking,\u201d Potter said as he poured the stinging liquid across the back of Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cOne time, she disappeared so long, Ron and I reported her missing. McGonagall found her in Hogwarts, having an argument with the house-elves. Another time, she robbed Borgin and Burke\u2019s because she wanted to know how a cursed amulet worked. There was also\u2014\u201c he winced, \u201c\u2014one time she apparated into Downing Street to scold the Prime Minister about a policy decision she didn\u2019t like. It was a mess. Worst birthday I ever had.\u201d\n\u201cYou and Weasley are both unbelievable,\u201d Draco said, rolling his eyes and standing to leave.\n\u201cJust watch out, when she hums, that\u2019s usually the only sign she\u2019s about to apparate.\u201d\nThey reappeared in the Kensington Gardens. Draco was gripping Hermione\u2019s hand, stomach roiling violently from the abrupt disapparition as he tried to regain his bearings. He discovered that his cashmere scarf and three buttons on his shirt did not appear to have survived the journey.\nIt was raining there. A light drizzle misting down on them as they stood in the dark and empty park.\nWithout releasing her hand, he studied Hermione, trying to determine what she might do next. Slipping her wand away from her would be ideal, but Potter and Weasley had several horror stories about the potential consequences of trying to relieve her of her wand. Drunk Hermione was apparently uninhibited and creative in her choice of defensive hexes.\nShe simply stood glancing around.\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite places,\u201d she finally said. \u201dMy dad and I used to come here on Sundays. He used to travel, you know.\u201d\nDraco hadn\u2019t known.\nHer parents were in Australia, and it was, he had learned, not something she liked to talk about.\n\u201cItchy feet, my mum always said.\u201d The corner of her mouth curved into a wistful smile, and her eyes were far away as though she wasn\u2019t seeing the empty park but something distant and lost in the past. The misting rain was catching in her hair and lashes, and she looked almost ethereal, so effortlessly lovely that Draco couldn\u2019t have turned from her if he\u2019d wanted to.\n\u201cWhen we came here, he always told me stories about all the places he\u2019d been. We had a map at home, marking all the cities he\u2019d visited. I always thought I\u2019d travel after school. Even when I went to Hogwarts, I still planned to have a gap year so I could see the world before I settled down with a job, but\u2014\u201c she looked down, \u201cI needed an extra year to graduate, and by then, financially things weren\u2019t exactly\u2014\nShe stopped.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in the cards anymore,\u201d she finally said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, but she looked down. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the most important thing.\u201d\nHer shoulders squared, and she flashed him a brilliant smile. \u201cI get to do it now. It might even be better. I think it could be, doing it when I\u2019m older.\u201d\nShe tilted her head to the side, eyebrows furrowing. \u201cI never told anyone about traveling. Harry and Ron weren\u2019t really interested when I mentioned it back in school. I\u2019m not sure what everyone will think.\u201d\nDraco forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine. Even if they aren\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t hold yourself back.\u201d\nBut he looked away as he said it. His chest felt constricted and hollow at the same time. He squeezed her hand where it was still tucked around his arm and exhaled slowly, trying to ignore the corrosive sense of despair spreading across his chest.\nHe shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He really shouldn\u2019t. This was the way she was.\nFull of plans and ideas for the future, and Draco never felt he had a place in any of them.\nShe always accounted for Potter and Weasley\u2019s feelings, considered the disapproval of Molly Weasley, and the potential professional consequences or fallout when spinning her castles in the air.\nBut Draco wasn\u2019t included.\nWhatever impulsive plans she happened to be enraptured by, Draco was never factored into them. Not after six months together. Not after a year.\nNot after two.\nIn all the infinite futures she envisioned and told him about, he was a non-element.\nAs he stood, trying to absorb it, her hand slipped free from his. Before he could reach out, she\u2019d walked a few steps further along the path alone.\nHe stared wistfully after her. The rain was steadily seeping through his clothing.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d he finally asked.\nShe stopped and was quiet for a moment before turning back, gnawing thoughtfully on her lip. \u201cSoon. I want to go as soon as I can. I don\u2019t want to keep waiting. I\u2019ll just keep finding reasons to put it off.\u201d\nDraco nodded, wondering if he was at least part of that. Maybe there\u2019d been a test at some point he\u2019d unknowingly failed, some threshold he\u2019d never reached.\nIf he could figure out what it was, he might be able to fix it. If he could pinpoint the ways in which he wasn\u2019t enough. Perhaps she would have gone sooner, but she\u2019d waited because of him.\nA two-year delay, and now she\u2019d made her ruling: the world had more to offer than Draco Malfoy did.\nHe could hardly argue with that.\nShe was turning away again, eyes dreamy and alight. The rain was falling faster now, hard enough to hear in the quiet of the park.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he forced his voice to stay light. \u201cI suppose I have to let you go then.\u201d\nShe stopped mid-stride and her head jerked as she turned sharply back to stare at him. Her eyes had gone wide.\nDraco raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe was silent. Then, after a moment, she inhaled and looked down at her hands, seeming to be at a loss for words for several seconds. \u201cOh. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014 I thought \u2014 I thought you\u2019d want to come with me.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart skipped a beat and then several more as he stared at her.\n\u201cMe?\u201d He finally managed to say.\nShe was fidgeting with the buttons on her coat. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201dYou didn\u2019t\u2014mention me,\u201d Draco said.\nHermione looked up.\n\u201cI \u2014 I just assumed. You always \u2014 come. You\u2019re always interested in what I\u2019m doing, so I thought \u2014\u201d She looked down again and exhaled. \u201cSorry. Of course, you don\u2019t want to. That would be a lot \u2014 to leave. I wasn\u2019t even thinking. It was \u2014 \u201c she shook her head sharply and bit her lip, \u201cSorry. Here I am talking about traveling for years, and you don\u2019t even \u2014 Sorry \u2014\u201c\nDraco stepped forward, closing the space between them. His hand slid against the side of her neck, slipping beneath her damp hair, fingers curling around the juncture of her neck and shoulder to draw her closer as he stared at her. The droplets of rain had caught in her lashes, glittering like constellations to framed her eyes.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he said quickly, heart pounding out of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere in the world with you if you want me to.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? You don\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAnywhere. Anything,\u201d he said as he pulled her into his arms.\nThey were standing so close their faces nearly touched. His fingers brushed against the column of her throat until he found the quick, nervous flutter of her pulse where it was hidden beneath her jaw, racing at a tempo that matched his heartbeat.\nHe could scarcely breathe because he was drowning in her. He dipped his head forward. Her lips against his were like a firestorm, searing enough to burn straight to his soul.\nHe inhaled against her lips and pulled her closer, kissing her again. \u201cWhatever you want, Granger.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe warlock is saying something important.\nDraco is sure it\u2019s important even if he can\u2019t be bothered to pay attention. There\u2019s a pause.\nLong enough to make Draco realise it\u2019s his cue. His heart jumps and he inhales.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and immediately the oath he just made takes hold, pulsing through his veins.\nHe probably should be paying attention to what\u2019s being said. It would be the sensible thing to do when using immutable magic involving his soul. He knows that\u2014logically.\nHowever, Hermione is standing in front of him and it\u2019s impossible to pay attention to anything else. Her smile is wide and her eyes are crinkled up into crescents, the sparkling brown just barely visible as she beams at him. Her fingers are entwined with his, squeezing his hands tighter and tighter.\nDraco\u2019s so overwhelmed currently, he\u2019s afraid if he does anything but look at her, he\u2019ll start weeping like a fool.\nThe warlock begins speaking again but Draco can\u2019t tear his eyes from Hermione.\nShe\u2019s radiant. He knew she\u2019d be beautiful, but he hadn\u2019t been prepared for how stunning she\u2019d be in bridal white. The sight of her at the end of the aisle left him unable to breathe.\nHer skin is gilded by the deepening hues of evening sunlight. Her hair is resplendent and untamed, barely contained by the veil that frames her. There\u2019s a small peony pinned above her left temple.\nThere\u2019d been talk of Sleekeazy\u2019s treatment. Neat curls for the wedding photos, perhaps an elegant updo. Ginny had been full of ideas and there have been dozens of practice stylings devoted to taming Hermione\u2019s hair. Unfortunately, Draco accidentally knocked the potion out a window the night before, and even though Ginny could have sworn she\u2019d had two bottles, no one could find them, and all the nearby beauty apothecaries were completely sold out.\nAn astonishing series of coincidences if there ever was one.\nThere\u2019d been absolutely no choice but leave Hermione\u2019s hair alone and natural for the wedding.\nThe warlock stops speaking and there\u2019s another pause.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hermione says, lifting her chin. Her magic flares through her fingertips against his skin. Subtle golden tendrils that lace between their fingers. Her eyes widen incrementally as she stares up at him, he can see the emotions brimming in them.\nHe glances down to watch the binding magic wrap itself around their wrists.\nThe enchantments in their wedding vows have to be subtle. It\u2019s necessary when there are Muggles in attendance.\nWendell and Monica Wilkins are sitting one row from the front, close enough that it seems they could be family. Hermione met them during her annual holidays in Australia several years earlier and they\u2019ve grown very close. She is, they often tell people, the daughter they never had.\nIt\u2019s a very small wedding that the Wilkins have travelled from Australia to attend. Intimate friends and adopted family only.\nThe row for parents was expected to remain empty. Hermione Granger is legally orphaned, and Draco expects to be disowned by the end of the day.\nPerhaps not.\nDespite his parents\u2019 cold refusal to acknowledge the relationship or the engagement, and the silence in response to the wedding invitation, Narcissa is present. She arrived just as the music began. It was the first time Draco had seen her in months. There was no time for him to do anything but take her arm and escort her in.\nHer posture is rigid and her expression a cool mask, but her eyes shine and she blinks rapidly as she sits watching.\nIt\u2019s not a society wedding. His mother\u2019s presence makes Draco more aware of that. It hasn\u2019t been planned down to the embroidery on the napkins. Most of the details revolved around accommodating the Wilkins, and discussing how to perform the necessary ceremonies without the magic being obvious.\nHermione wanted her parents to be at her wedding infinitely more than she cared about venues, or chinaware, or the shade of the fairy lights in the trees.\nPeople have always been the only part that mattered to her.\n\u201c\u2026then I declare you bonded for life,\u201d says the warlock, tapping his wand against Draco and Hermione\u2019s conjoined hands. The tendrils from their vows weave around their fingers and wrists, entwining with each other.\nDraco watches as they swirl around one final time before wrapping about their ring fingers and setting into wedding bands. As the bands form, they\u2019re intended to kiss.\nDraco looks up and realises he\u2019d never asked Hermione how she wanted their wedding kiss.\nProbably something restrained. She\u2019s never been much for overt displays of affection, she prefers subtle intimacy. He doesn\u2019t want to look like some kind of entitled bastard acting as if he owns her because she married him.\nHe dips his head to meet her lips chastely, but she takes a quick step forward. Her lips capture his in a fiery and possessive kiss. She is as unrestrained as the dawn.\nGryffindor. She always had to be first and best. Of course she beat him to their first kiss.\nThere\u2019s a part of him that wants to laugh as he meets her lips, cradling her face in his hands as the magic of their marriage bond floods through them.\nChrist, he worships her.\nHis arms wrap around her waist and he kisses her hungrily, lifting her off the ground. She slides her arms around his neck and there\u2019s nothing else that matters. He could stay in that moment until the galaxies burn out.\nShe draws back just enough to breathe, pressing their foreheads together, still holding him. She smiles as she catches her breath against his lips.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to love you for eternity,\u201d she whispers to him.\nAs he stares up at her, he realises there are tears blurring in his eyes. He keeps holding her, unable to let go or set her down. The evening light has faded to dusk and the stars begin to emerge in the night sky, but as Draco stands looking at her, he could swear she\u2019s a sunrise in his arms, as bright and glorious as the dawn.\nThe music has started again. They were supposed to have already turned and presented themselves to the witnesses. There\u2019s a recessional, a reception, dancing. Cake, probably.\nDraco doesn\u2019t particularly care about any of it. The only part that matters has happened; he\u2019s holding his wife.\nHermione\u2019s in no more a rush than he is. She dips her head and her lips meet his again, slowly. The kiss is so deeply ardent he can feel the burn of their souls on his lips.\nIf anything is able to last an eternity, it would be the way she loves.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re so old now.\u201d\nDraco blinked into his morning tea before looking up to glare at the place where his wife, the light of his life, sat across the table from him.\n\u201cGranger.\u201d\nShe looked up at him, her gaze innocent. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll turn grey first, or just go white?\u201d\nDraco set his teacup down into its saucer with an audible click. \u201cI\u2019m forty.\u201d\nShe gave an assenting hum and bit into her toast. Left in peace, he lifted his cup back up to sip his tea.\n\u201cYou could go bald.\u201d\nHe choked and nearly dropped his teacup onto his eggs.\n\u201cI\u2019m forty,\u201d he growled the words. \u201cI have no intention of balding or greying anytime soon.\u201d\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cWasn\u2019t your maternal grandfather bald?\u201d\nHis jaw twitched as he gave a begrudging nod of admission and suppressed the urge to reach up and feel his hairline.\nHermione was lazily stirring her tea. \u201cMale pattern baldness comes from the maternal side.\u201d\nDraco set his newspaper down. \u201cIs there something you want?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI\u2018m just thinking aloud.\u201d\nDraco turned back to his paper, but couldn\u2019t do a damn thing but wonder what had inspired the line of thought. Was his hairline receding? He was certain he would have noticed while dressing that morning, but now he suddenly doubted everything.\nHis grandfather Cygnus had been bald...\nAll the words on his paper seemed to say \u201cBald. Bald. Bald.\u201d\nHe set his paper down with a snap and stood without a word, stalking from the room.\nHis hair looked the same. He studied his reflection in the hallway mirror carefully, trying to check his hairline from all angles.\nA peal of laughter floated down the hallway. He looked over to find Hermione gripping the doorframe and shaking with semi-suppressed laughter.\nHe glowered as she came towards him. \u201cYou are a cruel witch. You can\u2019t throw male pattern baldness in a man\u2019s face on his birthday. You\u2019re already forty. I would never say a word about\u2014\u201c\nHer eyes widened incrementally.\nDraco\u2019s jaw hung ajar for a split-second. \u201cAbout\u2014about anything. Because there\u2019s nothing I could comment on. You\u2019re ageless.\u201d\nHer eyes were dancing with amusement. \u201cRight. Well, that\u2019s only because you\u2019re a better liar. Your mother is going to spoil you all day, someone needs to be a little bit mean to keep you from getting pretentious again.\u201d\nDraco snorted and rolled his eyes as she reached him and straightened his collar in a manner that appeared demure but was fundamentally possessive. \u201cYou could just be a sweet wife for a day. We could try it\u2014as an experiment.\u201d\nShe leaned closer until her breath fanned against his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can manage a whole day.\u201d Her voice dropped low and sultry. \u201cI\u2019ll be sweet tonight.\u201d\nA shiver crept down his spine and he bit his lip. \u201cWell, I suppose an evening is a start.\u201d\nThe corner of her mouth curved upwards, and her eyes crinkled into a familiar, happy pattern. \u201dIt\u2019s possible I\u2019ll grow docile with age.\u201d\nDraco scoffed and eyed her. \u201cUnlikely. I intend to be stuck with you this way. What would I even do with a compliant spouse?\u201d\nShe grinned. \u201cOne of those mysteries we\u2019ll never solve.\u201d She brushed his hair back with her fingertips before kissing him. \u201cHappy birthday, Draco.\u201c\n\u201cGranger, I\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you.\u201d\nA cold, unwelcome voice interrupted Hermione while she was in the middle of typing in a citation link that was three lines long. She pointedly refused to turn until she finished typing in the string of numbers and hit enter.\nA paywall filled the screen.\nShe sighed and with an inward curse of exasperation, shifted in her chair to deal with the unwelcome distraction on her hands.\nDraco Malfoy was standing behind her, scowling.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Malfoy?\u201d\nHe raised his right hand to show a thick stack of papers gripped in his hand. \u201cThe study guide you wrote. The answer to twenty is wrong.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s shoulders stiffened, but she kept her expression impassive as she tried to remember what question twenty even was.\nProfessor Snape had emailed the class a study guide with well-over three hundred broadly-phrased questions that \u201cmight\u201d appear on the final exam. Hermione had spent a night filling out the study guide questions with exhaustively detailed answers, quotes, and references. She\u2019d emailed a copy to the private study group she participated in, hoping to encourage the other members to share theirs as well so everyone could compare notes and develop even more comprehensive answers.\nInstead, no one else in the study group bothered to write any answers for the study guide at all; and, to add insult to injury, someone whom Hermione intended to murder once she discovered their identity, had forwarded it to the entire class. Everywhere she went, she\u2019d hear her fellow freshman classmates quizzing each other and reciting her answers verbatim.\nShe stared up at Draco Malfoy, who was notably not a member of said study group, standing with her painstakingly compiled study-guide gripped in his unworthy hands.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the answer?\u201d she asked.\nMalfoy glanced derisively down at the papers in his hand and turned his wrist to show her an extensively annotated and highlighted copy of her answer. There was a large section that had been slashed through with a red pen. \u201cThis whole section here, it completely leaves out Bourne\u2019s commentary. Are you trying to sabotage the entire class by sending everyone shit answers?\u201d\nHermione\u2019s chest tightened and heat rose on her cheeks.\nMalfoy stepped closer, and he leaned over her, smirking.\n\u201cIs that your plan then?\u201d He quirked a pale eyebrow. \u201cThink you\u2019ll be the one to get Snape\u2019s coveted A+ on your paper if you get the rest of the class to fail the final?\u201d\nHermione\u2019s hand itched to slap him across the face or possibly deck him right there in the library.\nSnape\u2019s required freshman class was renown at their school for its tendency to destroy GPA. Everything hung on the final exam and paper. There were more than a few stories of students losing their merit scholarships and having to leave the school because of it. Snape never gave more than one perfect grade on final papers per year, and rumor had that it had been more than four years since anyone had achieved it.\nMalfoy had announced during orientation week that he was going to be the one to earn it and it seemed that everyone believed he would.\nDraco Malfoy was one of those people that everyone seemed to know about. It was impossible to go anywhere without hearing stories about him. According to the aggressive rumor-mill at the school, he\u2019d gotten a perfect SAT score and been inundated with acceptance letters and full-ride scholarships from prestigious universities across the country, but had decided to attend a \u201cless known\u201d school because his mother was close friends with the president and agreed with school\u2019s academic philosophy.\nHe\u2019d been dubbed, practically from arrival, as the class \u201cgenius\u201d and had an entire flock of freshman and non-freshman girls angling to get their Mrs degree in Malfoy.\nHermione thought he was a pretentious asshole.\nShe was most definitely going to kill whomever it was who had allowed him to get his hands on her study-guide.\nShe gave a cold smile. \u201cGosh. You caught me, Malfoy. I put wrong answers on the study-guide and hoped nobody in our entire class would notice.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t include anything from Bourne is because Snape said he\u2019s wrong and the only reason his textbook was required reading was to highlight what idiots some people are. If you want to add Bourne\u2019s commentary to your answer, be my guest. In fact,\u201d she leaned forward, extending her hand, \u201cI have a better idea, why don\u2019t you give me my study-guide back, and write your own answers.\u201d\nHe smirked and straightened, sliding her study guide back into his satchel. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m going to be the one whose paper gets a perfect grade from Snape. I have to say though, it\u2019s fun to see you trying.\u201d\nHermione refused to rise to his baiting. \u201cAnything else? By all means, feel free to spread a rumor that my study guide's rigged. Maybe then people will do their own homework.\u201d\nHe cocked his head. \u201cSo you admit you\u2019re angling for the A+.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes and sat back. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty sure everyone is trying to get it. This isn\u2019t exactly a school with a class culture of only aspiring for passing grades.\u201d\nMalfoy moved slightly closer, edging into her personal space and looming over her in a way that made her want to kick him in the shins or, ideally, a bit higher.\n\u201cBut you actually think you can do it, don\u2019t you?\u201d He flashed another smirk. \u201cCare to bet on that?\u201d\n\u201cCare to leave me alone and bother someone else?\u201d Hermione said in a deadpan tone.\nHis smirk widened into a grin and he glanced across the library where a group of his friends were all watching them. \u201cWell, I should clarify, there are already bets that I\u2019ll get it, but I\u2019ll make a personal wager with you. Think you can beat me? Tell me what you want. I\u2019m open to anything.\u201d\nHis eyes slid down, away from her face.\nHermione folded her arms again and glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you, Malfoy, and you\u2019re not getting a thing from me. Fuck off, I\u2019m working on a paper.\u201d\nShe turned back to her computer and watched his silhouette linger in the reflection of her laptop screen for several seconds.\nFinally, he laughed. \u201cThanks for the notes, Granger. I look forward to beating you.\u201d\nHe turned and sauntered off.\nSnape\u2019s approach to finals was unconventional even for the school. The week before the final exam, each student had a private, twenty-minute meeting with him in which they had to defend their paper. At the end of the meeting, he would tell the student what grade they\u2019d receive on the paper, and then, before the final exam, he\u2019d announce to the class if any students had earned an A+.\nTo Hermione\u2019s irritation, Malfoy\u2019s scheduled meeting with Snape was forty minutes before hers. The hallway outside his office door was lined with students sitting silently and reviewing their papers and notes.\nThe office door swung open and Malfoy emerged, his face aglow with smug triumph.\nThe hallway broke out in whispers.\n\u201cYou got it?\u201d Nott asked right out.\nMalfoy grinned. \u201cPerfect grade. First one in five years he said.\u201d\nHermione stiffened where she was sitting as whispers of admiration and congratulations swept down the hallway.\nPadma Patil was sitting next to Hermione and rested a hand briefly on her shoulder.\nMalfoy\u2019s attention zeroed in and he walked over, stopping in front of Hermione.\n\u201cTough luck, Granger. Maybe in another life. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll at least get an A.\u201d He started to turn and then paused as though he were just remembering something. \u201cA lot of us are going to be celebrating tonight, you should come\u2014unless you want people to think you\u2019re a sore loser.\u201d\nHermione stared up at him with a flat expression until he finally turned with a shrug and walked away.\nWhen she emerged from her meeting, she didn\u2019t say a word to the other students waiting in the hallway. She went to her dorm and started studying for the rest of her finals.\nThe final exam for Snape\u2019s class started at an ungodly hour in the morning and the room was blessedly silent as students trickled in and took their seats. Hermione sat reviewing her notes in a corner where no one was likely to jostle her.\nThe silence was broken when Malfoy entered the room noisily with his friends at his heels and they settled into seats towards the front of the room.\nFive minutes before the exam was scheduled to begin, Snape strode into the room and up to the whiteboard. He snatched up a marker and started writing grading percentage brackets. When he finished he added a colon beside each bracket and began adding numbers: number of papers that had failed, the number that had barely passed, moving up towards the 100% that sat at the top of the board.\nHis hand hovered next to it, and then he suddenly turned and stared at the room, his expression unreadable.\n\u201cThis semester has a notable distinction,\u201d he said after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cFor the first time in the years I\u2019ve been teaching at this college, I have had two students who merited a perfect grade on the semester\u2019s final paper.\u201d\nHushed gasps swept across the room and students turned to look at Malfoy, whose smirking grin had frozen on his face.\n\u201cNext semester, anyone who hasn\u2019t failed my class will be assigned to read Mr Malfoy and Miss Granger\u2019s papers, and perhaps then the rest of you will begin to understand what I mean when I say I expect and will accept nothing less than excellence in this class.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s platinum head slowly swiveled to so he could stare across the room where Hermione was sitting, an impassive expression on her face.\nShe didn\u2019t look in his direction.\nHe kept staring at her until someone shoved a copy of the exam at him.\nTwo hours later, after turning in her copy of the final exam, Hermione packed her bag, bobbing her head at a few whispered congratulations, and hurried out of the classroom, heading for the library.\n\u201cGranger!\u201d\nShe froze and turned, rolling her eyes.\nMalfoy was jogging after her, notably without his usual posse around him.\nShe stood waiting until he caught up with her.\nHe stopped a foot away from her and looked her up and down from head to toe as though he were reconsidering something. \u201cWell, you\u2019re full of surprises, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHermione folded her arms. \u201cNot really.\u201d\nHe looked up and met her eyes, flashing a grin. He cocked his head slightly to the side. \u201cI guess this means we should study together.\u201d\nHermione gave a thin, false smile. \u201cI already have a study group, we\u2019re not accepting new members.\u201d\nHis grin turned roguish and his voice dropped suggestively as he shifted closer. \u201cIt could just be the two of us. You\u2019re heading to the library now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHer expression turned cold and she stepped quickly back. \u201dI\u2019m going to study alone.\u201d\nShe turned on her heel and started walking away.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t avoid me forever, Granger!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised,\u201d she said, glaring over her shoulder at him.\nHe was still standing where she\u2019d left him, staring after her, that irritating, over-confident grin still on his face.\nHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cCare to bet on that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t do it, Potter. I don\u2019t care how many years of friendship or mutual antagonism you attempt to invoke, the answer is no.\u201d\nMalfoy flung the door of his study open and stalked over to his desk, dropping into a chair and folding his arms as he glared at Harry. \u201cFuck off. I said I would get you in, I did so. You get no further aid from me.\u201d\nHarry shut the door, rubbing the back of his head. \u201cI get that it\u2019s not ideal, Malfoy\u2014\u201c\nMalfoy gave a loud, disgusted snort to indicate of \u201cnot ideal\u201d was putting it much too mildly.\n\u201cWe need this contact, and she\u2019s taken a fancy to you. I\u2019m not saying actually do anything with her, I\u2019m just saying maintain contact, flirt a bit; see if she\u2019ll tell you something.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s grey eyes were glaring daggers at Harry.\n\u201cI am married.\u201d He waved his left hand demonstratively to highlight the wedding band, his expression contemptuous. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve somehow forgotten. I\u2019m not getting drinks, maintaining contact, or flirting with some lonely woman because your department is incapable of incriminating a smuggling ring with their own personnel.\u201d\nHarry sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she knows this is my idea and that you don\u2019t even want to do it.\u201d\nMalfoy stood up, looking murderous. \u201cYou will not breathe a word about this to my wife.\u201d His voice was quiet and deadly. \u201cGet out of my house before I have you thrown out.\u201d\nHarry folded his arms and refused to budge. \u201cIf I explain, I\u2019m sure Hermione will understand\u2014\u201c\n\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d A curious voice came from behind Harry.\nMalfoy blanched and Harry whirled to see Hermione poking her head through the doorway.\n\u201cThe portraits said you two were fighting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Potter\u2019s leaving,\u201d Malfoy said, his tone pointed.\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry said quickly, \u201cMalfoy\u2019s been helping us try to break into the smuggling ring I told you about last week. There\u2019s a Veela involved who noticed him and asked him to have a drink with her tonight.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s eyes widened with surprise.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not doing it. I told him as much, and now he\u2019s leaving.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice was cold fury and right next to Harry\u2019s ear.\nHermione\u2019s mouth twitched, and her eyes grew round and shiny. She clamped both hands over her mouth as she kept looking between Malfoy and Harry. After a moment her shoulders started shaking visibly.\n\u201cHermione...\u201d Malfoy reached towards her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\nHermione shook her head wordlessly and backed up, her shoulders shaking harder.\n\u201cDarling, please don\u2019t be upset...\u201d Malfoy sounded like a wounded animal. \nHermione\u2019s hands dropped away from her mouth and she proceeded to howl with laughter.\nHarry and Malfoy stared at each other with confusion before looking back to Hermione.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201c she stared at Harry, gasping for breath, \u201c\u2014you\u2019re expecting him\u2014to flirt?\u201d\nShe slid down the wall, giggling hysterically, tears leaking from her eyes.\n\u201cHarry\u2014have you\u2014have you seen him when he tries to flirt?\u201d She was wiping her eyes and wheezing with laughter.\nHarry\u2019s head swiveled and he stared thoughtfully at Malfoy. \u201cThat\u2019s a fair point.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth was opening and closing like a fish. \u201cI\u2014\u201c he spluttered, \u201cI can flirt!\u201d\nIt\u2019s the moonless nights when he comes.\nThe bed creaks and Hermione feels the mattress shift. When she opens her eyes, darkness like a black hole looms over her. Impossibly long fingers slide possessively around her shoulders, pulling her close, lips finding hers, as he slowly bleeds into view. His pale skin and hair barely visible in the dim light.\nShe wraps her arms around him, pulling him desperately close and kissing across his face. \u201cDraco\u2026 Draco\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d come again.\u201d\nHe feels so close to human. Almost. Everywhere she touches him, he feels almost human. His fingers are almost human but too long. His features still almost the same but the angles are sharper now, harder. His eyes are still silver, but now there\u2019s a luminous glow behind them and the sclera surrounding them is black. Everything about him whispers, \u201cother.\u201d\nHe wraps his arms tightly around her and lies there for several minutes just holding her. She runs her fingers across his shoulders, trying to feel him, to memorise the weight of his body resting against hers and what it feels like when he grips her close against his chest, so she can replay it on all the nights when he isn\u2019t there.\nHe breathes in against her hair, and his hands begin roaming across her body, gripping her closer, dragging her tight against him so that she wraps her legs around his hips, pulling his mouth against hers.\nThere\u2019s a bitter aftertaste to his kisses, like ash on her tongue.\nShe draws back, running her fingertips across the sharp angle of his cheekbone before tracing up an elongating ear.\nHis silver eyes stare down at her in the darkness, the irises are tinged blood red.\nThere\u2019s a pang in her chest as she realizes that the expression in his eyes isn\u2019t the same. There\u2019s something missing now in the way he looks at her.\nHe looks away. Preoccupied with ripping her slip out of the way so that it no longer obstructs his view. She reaches out and tilts his face up so that their eyes meet again.\n\u201cDo you remember me, Draco?\u201d she asks after a long silence. \u201cDo you remember why you come here?\u201d\nHe goes rigid, staring at her, then a growl vibrates through him, starting low in his chest and the rising up until she feels the burn of his breath on her face as he grips her crushingly close. He buries his face against her shoulder and she feels his fangs drag across her skin in a way that sends a shiver racing down her spine.\n\u201cMine.\u201d\nShe gives a laugh and presses their faces together. \u201cYes. You married me, once upon a time.\u201d\nShe kisses him again as he pulls away the shredded remains of her slip until she\u2019s bare beneath him. He slithers down her body, serpentine and possessive. Running his fingers across every inch of her. Following it with his tongue and his teeth. She moans at his touch, gripping his shoulders, twisting her legs around him, raking her fingernails across his shoulders as she shatters, feeling them score across his skin.\n\nRemember me. Remember that I touched you. Carry the marks with you when you go. \n\nWhen he pushes into her, he pauses and his shoulders twist. With a long groan, his wings emerge and unfurl, black enough to swallow the night sky. The deadly claws on the arc of the wings are only inches above her face. She\u2019s used to it now, but she still experiences a stabbing jolt of fear every time she watches it happen. His wings flare out when she tenses around him and tangles her arms and legs with his.\nHis shoulders tremble when her fingers trail near his wings. She brushes her fingers lightly against the base and he gives a rasping moan as his body jerks.\nThe rest of the world can fade away. He\u2019s all she sees and that\u2019s more than enough.\n\u201cHermione,\u201d he says, nuzzling her afterwards when they\u2019re lying side by side. He\u2019s folded his wings possessively around her, they\u2019re warm and soft against her bare skin. Her legs are tangled with his and he\u2019s cradling her face in his hands, staring at her, studying her.\n\u201cYes?\u201d she says.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nShe rests a hand on his cheek, her fingers resting on the sharpening angle of his cheekbone for a moment before her hand slides back to run through his hair. There\u2019s a ridge under his hair just past his hairline. She traces her fingers over it.\nHe\u2019s growing horns.\nShe wonders if they\u2019ll be visible by the next time he comes.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m alright. You came back,\u201d she says.\nThey talk for the rest of the night. With every passing hour, Hermione watches the humanness slowly bleed back into him. She tells him about her research, about her theories. He doesn\u2019t tell her what he does when he\u2019s away. He doesn\u2019t want her to know, although she has her guesses. He reminisces about her, what he remembers of them.\n\u201cYou called me a cockroach,\u201d he says.\nHer eyes crinkle in the corners as she notices his mannerisms returning, his left eyebrow is quirked up and the corner of his mouth is pulling in a vague smirk.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cyou were\u2014back then.\u201d\nThey only have until dawn. He\u2019ll vanish as the sun rises.\nShe knows that there are parts of him that are fading away. Every month, each time he manages to slip between dimensions and return to her, there\u2019s less of him. Fewer of those infinite facets that she\u2019s memorised. The ones that remain when he returns are sharpened. On the inside and outside, he is becoming more of who he is.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s there.\nShe curls closer, pressing her face against his chest, listening for a heart that\u2019s ceased to beat. He wraps his arms around her, hands running up and down her back, unrestrainedly territorial, wings tightening protectively around her. She wonders what kind of hell he\u2019d bring down if anyone ever tried to take her from him.\nPersonal vice defines what a demon\u2019s nature is. It is the key to who they are and what they become.\u00a0\nDraco was always sinfully possessive.\nHe will always come back for what is his.\nAnd she\u2019ll always be waiting for him.\n\n\n\nA sticky face featuring two large grey eyes watched carefully as Draco took a bite and placed his fried confection back onto the plate.\n\u201cFather?\u201d\nDraco glanced up, doughnut halfway to his mouth again. \u201cYes?\u201d\nAurore licked her lips and shifted forward incrementally, her eyes fastened on the doughnut in his hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s nicest when we share treats.\u201d\nDraco froze, staring at her with his own grey eyes. He slowly quirked an eyebrow, studying the crumbs and traces of icing smeared across her chin. \u201cHow many doughnuts have you had today?\u201d\n\u201cFive,\u201d was the prompt reply.\nDraco raised his chin, cocking his head to the side. \u201cAnd how many am I having?\u201d\nAurore inhaled and leaned a little closer. \u201cOne.\u201d\n\u201cSo who exactly would be sharing? Are we sharing, or am I sharing?\u201d\nAurore glanced down, looking abashed and subsiding into a resigned silence.\nDraco took another bite of his doughnut and Aurore watched him, her eyes wide with longing. He met her gaze pointedly as he chewed and swallowed.\nAurore gave a long, wistful sigh, slumping back in her chair, legs kicking restlessly.\nDraco glanced away, staring out the window. His jaw twitched.\nAfter a moment he scoffed under his breath and dropped his head, giving a long sigh.\n\u201dDon\u2019t tell your mother.\u201d He dropped his doughnut back onto his plate and shoved the remaining three-quarters across the table towards his daughter\u2019s eager and sticky fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDraco...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmm\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop staring at my knickers.\u201d\n\n\nDraco blinked and tore his eyes away, glancing at the blank page in front of him before looking up, lashes demurely lowered. \u201cI was brainstorming.\u201d\n\n\nHermione snorted and slipped her wand into her hair before tugging her shirt down in an attempt at modesty. \u201cRight. What insights did my arse provide?\u201d\n\n\nDraco closed his journal and laid his quill aside before rolling over, his hand slithering towards her. \u201cI have a theory that orgasms increase concentration,\u201d he said, leering. \u201cI think we should experiment and find out.\u201d \n\n\nHer eyes were dancing. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d He started at her knee and began kissing up her thigh. \u201cStart with one, then observe productivity levels. On progressing days, we\u2019ll see how multiple orgasms affect things.\u201d\n\n\nHis fingers were trailing down her inner thighs. \n\n\n\u201cSounds comprehensive,\u201d she said. She sounded like she was attempting sarcasm, but the breathless quality undercut it. \n\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d he said, settling between her legs.\n\n\nHermione should have seen it coming. Really. Well, perhaps that was exactly the problem with becoming chronically nearsighted, she was incapable of seeing it coming.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter all, her vision didn\u2019t fade away overnight. When things in the distance were blurry, she\u2019d just assumed they blurred for everyone. It wasn\u2019t as if she spent much time staring into the distance anyway. \n\n\nShe was Hermione Granger, she preferred close at hand, immediate problems.\u00a0\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the jokes about how literally she took the phrase \u201cnose stuck in a book\u201d seemed to happen almost incessantly and Harry noted she squinted almost as much as he did when he\u2019d misplaced his glasses, that the thought even occurred to her.\n\n\nShe held out her hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHarry, give me your glasses.\u201d\n\n\nA tried and true friend, he took them off and handed them over without a word. She slid them onto her face, hooking them behind her ears, and then blinked.\n\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she said in astonishment as she discovered that the world came in a much higher resolution than she\u2019d been aware. There were details everywhere that she\u2019d been completely oblivious to. The titles of the books were legible and not just blurs of gilding along the spine. \u201cI think I might need to see an optician\u201d\n\n\nShe had more than just needed to see one. She was suffering from severely deteriorating eyesight. Apparently the flashes and explosions during the war had not done her pupils any favours, and Hermione had been so busy that she\u2019d failed to take any interventionary steps until the nearsightedness was quite severe. But fortunately, magical opticians were quite good at their jobs and in short order, she had a pair of round lens spectacles especially bespelled to protect her eyesight and prevent any further decline as long as she wore them consistently.\n\n\n\u201cWe match,\u201d Harry said, looking like a proud father as Hermione stared at her suddenly glaringly detailed reflection in a mirror. Good lord, why didn\u2019t anyone tell her that her curls had that many flyaways.\n\n\nHarry patted her head. \u201cI always thought that of the three of us, you should be the one with glasses.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt makes you look even scarier, I think,\u201d Ron said, glancing up from a quidditch recap in the newspaper.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think she looks cute,\u201d Ginny called from the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cScary-cute,\u201d Harry said brightly as if he\u2019d just invented a solution for world peace.\u00a0\n\n\nHermione rolled her eyes at them all. \u201cThey\u2019re just glasses. I doubt anyone will even notice.\u201d\n\n\nShe was right, most people didn\u2019t notice. A few coworkers commented that they suited her. There were a few comments that she looked like a librarian, but for the most part, Hermione Granger in glasses was regarded more as inevitability than ground-breaking.\u00a0\n\n\nShe discovered within a matter of hours that being nearsighted had done favours to several of her colleagues. It had smoothed wrinkles, blurred skin discolouration, hidden greasy hair, and concealed a great deal of dandruff.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all, Hermione wasn\u2019t convinced she liked seeing the world with quite so much clarity.\u00a0\n\n\nJust past noon, the department heads started assembling for the review meeting, a weekly event that Hermione ran as head of her Department.\n\n\nThe last person to arrive, as usual, was Malfoy.\u00a0\n\n\nMalfoy had always treated Hermione\u2019s Ministry position as if it were a personal attack that the universe had cobbled together just to offend him.\n\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t his superior, but given the way he behaved, a person would think she was. The Ministry hierarchy was convoluted, but they had relatively equal positions, just within different departments. Hermione\u2019s job was to make sure all the departments were adhering to Ministry rules and regulations, reviewing their work and ensuring that they hadn\u2019t forgotten to dot any i\u2019s before sending drafts up the chain of command.\u00a0\n\n\nBut given that Hermione was the one holding the rubber stamp of approval, Malfoy acted like Hermione was his manager, and he hated it. He made a scene every time he arrived, bringing an entire tea service or lunch for everyone, making comments about how \u2018some people\u2019 never knew how to take a break. He always sat directly across from her at the far end of the table so that he could stare judgmentally at her the entire time, asking more questions than anyone else.\n\n\nAnd he always arrived late.\u00a0\n\n\nToday, as he sauntered through the door, Hermione glanced up, then she blinked and did a double take, shocked by the unwanted revelation that Draco Malfoy, the proverbial thorn in her side, was horrifyingly attractive. Enough so that she found her mouth hanging open as she took in the newly detailed sight of him.\n\n\nHer lack of farsightedness had spared her the knowledge that at some point in the last several years Draco Malfoy had grown into himself and then some. Given that they never came within a few feet of each other, she had been blessedly ignorant of just how handsome he was. He had sharp, angular cheekbones, and his dark eyes and lashes made his grey eyes stand out starkly against his pale skin. He also had the cleanest, shiniest hair of anyone in the room with nary a speck of dandruff to be seen, his nails were all neatly manicured, and his robes excruciatingly well-tailored.\u00a0\n\n\nHe stared back at Hermione with his own expression of surprise but seemed to recover himself first.\n\n\n\u201cI think the fuck not,\u201d he said, and without further explanation, pivoted and walked straight back out of the meeting room.\n\n\nThe entire room stared after him, but Hermione had had more than enough. She didn\u2019t care how handsome he\u2019d been this whole time. She\u2019d been putting up with his attitude for months, and she was not going to overlook it a day longer.\u00a0\n\n\nShe mumbled a word of excuse and then charged through the doorway after him.\n\n\n\u201cMalfoy!\u201d She burst into his office over the protests of his secretary.\n\n\nMalfoy started with such surprise he appeared to leave the floor.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d She stood glaring at him, her hands on both hips.\n\n\nHe looked away from her and swallowed so visibly that his Adam\u2019s Apple bobbed. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll send an assistant or someone else in the department, but I won\u2019t be attending any more meetings.\u201d\n\n\nShe scoffed and kicked the door shut behind her with a bang. \u201cOh grow up. Really. You can\u2019t put up with having to work with me once a week. Could you be more of a child?\u201d\n\n\nShe advanced on him, trying to be as threatening as possible, but rather than retreat or counter, Malfoy just stood there, blushing profusely, and staring at her like a deer caught in the headlights of a car.\n\n\nShe stopped short and stared at him, her eyebrows furrowing in confusion.\n\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2026?\u201d she started with assurance but then her voice trailed off in bewilderment.\n\n\n\u201cY-yes?\u201d he stammered, which was very unlike him, and it made the tendons in his throat stand out and Hermione had no idea why, but she found it incredibly attractive and sent a warm flush through her. \n\n\nHad he always looked this way and she\u2019d just missed it?\u00a0\n\n\nShe blinked, determined to ignore how he looked. It didn\u2019t matter. He was still annoying, and finding him attractive didn\u2019t change that.\u00a0\n\n\nShe cleared her throat and tried to get straight to the point. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you attend any more meetings?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nA beat, because Malfoy appeared half distracted.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d he said, not even trying to lie convincingly.\n\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t give me that,\u201d she said, stepping even closer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been an overdramatic arse since the first day you came to a meeting. You always arrive late, and sit as far away as possible, ask me questions that you already know the answers to, and now suddenly you can\u2019t attend anymore. Why? Tell me, or I\u2019ll file a report with HR and you can tell them instead.\u201d\n\n\nHe glanced away. \u201cI can\u2019t keep looking at you. It distracts me too much.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\nHe retreated, apparently intuiting the way she suddenly wanted to hex him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe glasses,\u201d he swallowed visibly, \u201cthey\u2019re a hard limit.\u201d\n\n\nShe stood there in bewilderment.\n\n\nHe was still avoiding looking directly at her and seemed to mostly be talking to himself. \u201cI know myself, and if you sit glaring at me for an hour straight in glasses, I\u2019m not going to be able to think straight. It\u2019s physically impossible.\u201d\n\n\nShe snorted, not even trying to hide how offended she felt, how dare he imply there was anything unprofessional about her. \u201cWhen do I glare at you?\u201d\n\n\nHe finally looked at her again and gave an incredulous laugh. \u201cOh come off it, Granger, you always glare at me. I sit across from you and you look at everyone else like this \u2014\u201d he batted his lashes and widened his eyes so much that he looked like a baby deer, \u201c\u2013 but whenever I say anything, you look over and your entire face goes \u2014\u201d he narrowed his eyes exaggeratedly until they were nearly slits, causing his lips to purse.\u00a0\n\n\nHermione\u2019s mouth dropped open with indignation.\u00a0\n\n\nThen he waved her off. \u201cAnd you know what, I didn\u2019t even mind it. Some \u2014\u201d his voice seemed to crack just slightly, \u201c\u2013 might even argue there\u2019s a certain appeal to getting glared at by you. But I\u2019m at my limit. No thank you. You can glare at my assistant moving forward.\u201d\n\n\nHermione rolled her eyes. \n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t glaring at you, you great pillock. I\u2019m nearsighted.\u201d\u00a0\nShe gestured at the glasses. \u201cI just found out last week. If my eyes were narrowed when you were talking, it's because I was trying to see you. I was squinting. You sit all the way at the far end of the table, I had to narrow my eyes to make out your expressions. I don\u2019t just \u2013 glare at people! For heavens sake.\u201d\n\n\nNow Malfoy looked to be a mix of shocked and devastated. Like a child who\u2019d just found out that Santa Claus wasn\u2019t real.\n\n\n\u201cThis whole time,\u201d his voice was plaintive,\u00a0 \u201cyou\u2019ve been narrowing your eyes at me like that because you couldn\u2019t see?\u201d\n\n\nHermione felt her face grow warm. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to my vision as long as I could read.\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth opened and closed several times and he appeared to be in the middle of an internal crisis, which gave Hermione time to process a few things herself. She blinked several times.\n\n\nDraco Malfoy couldn\u2019t think straight when she glared at him?\n\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d she cocked her head to the side, her heartbeat quickening as she studied him, \u201cwhat exactly does my \u2018glaring\u2019 do to you?\u201d\n\n\nHe turned a spectacular shade of red. \u201cN-nothing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d she said slowly. \u201cSo this inability to think straight isn\u2019t due to anything specific?\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy\u2019s expression became suddenly cagey, and his eyes grew incredibly shifty in a way she probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to make out without her glasses on. He scuttled away from her, getting behind his desk and seating himself and putting on a great show of grabbing a large ostrich quill.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite busy right now,\u201d he proclaimed in a voice of great dignity.\n\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d Hermione advanced slowly on his desk.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cReally, Granger. Can we talk about this later?\u201d His voice seemed to climb a full octave with each sentence and he was assiduously avoiding eye-contact.\n\n\nHermione leaned against his desk, still observing him with scientific degree of appraisal. \u201cAnd this effect I have, you fear it will be worse now that I have these glasses?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShe reached up and adjusted them, still watching Malfoy carefully. He glanced up just in time to see her set them just a little more securely on the bridge of her nose and emitted a sort of strangled sound before averting his gaze again and rapidly devoting himself to signing documents as if the fate of the Wizarding world relied upon it.\n\n\nHermione watched, enjoying all the newly discovered angles of his face, wondering idly if he\u2019d moan if she were to trail her fingertips along them. She\u2019d never taken the time to consider Draco Malfoy in a sexual way, given that he\u2019d just been a talking blur at the far end of a table for the last several months, but it would seem that the line between frustration and sexual frustration was drawn at being able to appreciate his cheekbones.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nShe sat, biding her time and enjoying the view until he ran out of things to pretend he needed to sign.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, he looked up at her in resignation.\n\n\nShe drew a deep breath, and folded her arms. \u201cYou know, our departments have to meet, you can\u2019t just stop attending meetings.\u201d\n\n\nHe swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m sure my assistant is more than able \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to glare at your assistant,\u201d she said, brushing him off with the wave of her hand. \u201cI only like glaring at you.\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy made a sort of incredulous whimper in the back of his throat.\u00a0\n\n\nShe hummed. \u201cIt's not going to do either of any good to ignore this problem, and as your colleague it is in my best interest to help you.\"\n\n\nHe was staring at her with visible skepticism.\n\n\nShe tapped her chin thoughtfully. \"If focus is a concern, we are going to have to do something about that. I think chronic overexposure would probably do the trick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\u2019d grabbed the collar of his robes and tugged at them as if he were being strangled. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nHermione straightened, brushing the wrinkles from her skirt and then leaned towards him. \u201cIf you become immune to being around me, then an hour or so getting glared at in a Department Meeting will barely affect you. Would it?\u201d\n\n\nHe started to speak but then his mouth snapped shut and he swallowed. \u201cExactly how would I be getting exposed to you?\"\u00a0\n\n\nShe tilted her head to the side and pursed her lips. \"Well, we could just work in more proximity, but I think that would take up a lot of our time. I think there are more efficient forms of overexposure,\" she stared straight at his mouth as she said this. \"Don't you?\"\n\n\nHis tongue darted out to wet his lips and he exhaled. \"And this \u2014 is something you\u2019re volunteering to do?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the responsible thing to do, as your colleague.\u201d Her heart was a firestorm drumbeat of anticipation inside her chest. She had never propositioned a coworker before, but somehow suddenly being able to see the world in perfect clarity had also provided her with an unexpected quantity of self-confidence. She leaned in towards him, her hands braced on the back of his chair. \u201cIf you think about it. Logically.\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy drew a deep breath and she suddenly felt the need to send up a fervent prayer that she hadn't just entirely misunderstood things because she would probably die of embarrassment if he turned her down.\n\n\n\u201cWell, when you put it like that, we have no choice.\u201d He leaned intentionally forwards, bringing their faces closer, his eyes locked on her lips. Just breathing sent a shiver of anticipation straight through Hermione.\n\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d she said, her voice almost a whisper.\n\n\nHe kissed her.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir lips meeting sparked like magic in her veins. His mouth was warm against hers, and when she didn\u2019t draw back but instead parted her lips, he leaned closer. His fingers found her face, trailing across her cheek and then curling around her jaw to draw her in, draw her closer, kiss her deeper.\u00a0\n\n\nHermione may have only just realised that she was attracted to Malfoy, but she\u2019d never been one to shy away from throwing herself in headfirst when the situation required it. And she also wasn\u2019t one to shy away from an exhilarating experience as long as it didn\u2019t involve flying.\n\n\nShe reached out and ran a hand through his hair, fingernails grazing across his skin and he did indeed moan. Low as if it were dragged from him, and the sound vibrated through her, sending a thrill along her nerves that made her toes curl and her body move nearer to his. He tangled a hand in her hair at the base of her skull, tight enough to make her gasp, and when she did, he kissed her deeper and they might have gone on kissing except the clock chimed loudly, which reminded both of them that Hermione was supposed to have been running a department meeting just then.\n\n\nThey both drew back, breathing heavily.\n\n\nMalfoy\u2019s cheeks were stained pink, and he looked edible with his hair mussed and his lips reddened and his grey eyes dark. He stared straight back at her, chest heaving, scanning her own face as if he were reading her thoughts and it made her blush so much that her glasses fogged up and she had to pull them off and wipe at the lenses with the edge of her cardigan.\u00a0\n\n\nShe awkwardly straightened them and gave a little cough as she slid them back onto her face. \u201cWell, do you feel overexposed now?\u201d\n\n\nHe shook his head, still watching her. \u201cNo. I think I\u2019d need considerably more exposure before I\u2019m anywhere near that threshold.\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded and cleared her throat, trying to continue the charade she\u2019d started. \u201cTrue.\u201d It was her voice climbing octaves now. \u201cAnd we want to be scientific, so really, we\u2019ll need to do it repeatedly in order to have a meaningful sample size. Perhaps over an extended period of time. Do you have plans for this evening?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone that I can\u2019t cancel,\u201d he said, watching her through his lashes. \u201cYou know I take my job here very seriously.\u201d\n\n\nThat was probably the most absurd lie either of them had made yet.\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d She straightened, trying to regain her composure because she did still have a meeting to get back to and she couldn\u2019t walk back in while distracted by thoughts of what she wanted to do to Draco Malfoy that evening. Even though that was the only thing she currently wanted to think about.\u00a0\n\n\nShe cleared her throat. \u201cI can make an excuse for you for today\u2019s meeting, but we should aim for business as usual by next week.\u201d\n\n\nMalfoy stood, apparently having used up all his blushes during their earlier confrontation and now he looked aggravatingly smug.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou realise,\u201d he said slowly in that low drawl of his, \u201cthat will require a significant amount of exposure. I'd probably need your near constant presence during the next seven days.\u201d\n\n\nHis words were\u00a0 drenched with suggestion.\n\n\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d She was blushing all the way down her neck as she tried to sidle towards the door, struggling regain her composure and get back into a work headspace. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a hard worker, and I\u2019d never try to set anyone up for failure. So\u2026 we\u2019ll see what needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe was following her, and not looking at all like he intended to let her get back to her meeting.\n\n\n\u201cI really need to go,\" she said, trying to run for it, but he caught her wrist with a sly smirk.\n\n\n\u201cHold on, you can't leave yet. I need a little more exposure to get me through the rest of the day,\u201d he said, his voice as dark and sinful as chocolate as he drew her back and lowered his head to kiss her again.\u00a0\n\nMalfoy\u2019s hair was cropped against his skull when they brought him from Azkaban to St Mungo\u2019s.\nHermione almost didn\u2019t recognise him, just skin and bones, and none of that pale white-blond hair. She remembered the flashing lights, the healers and aurors scurrying through the halls.\n\nDay of his release \u2014 Not conscious \u2014 How long? \u2014 Vitals unstable \u2014 How long did the Dementor have him?\n\nThe words bled together, the clamour went on.\nAfter two months, he was still unconscious. It didn\u2019t take all of his soul, she was told. There was a possibility he might wake, but they put him in permanent spell damage.\nAn extra room added to Janus Thickey for the unusual case.\nHe just lay there, bone thin, grey eyes staring blindly at the ceiling. Never moving.\nUnaware, unresponsive, said his file, palliative care necessary.\nHe filled out again. Round the clock hospital care could do that. Eventually the hollows in his cheeks faded and color returned and he looked like Draco Malfoy. He stayed that way, as if encased in amber, frozen in a moment.\nOnly his hair changed, growing.\nShe thought about cutting it. When it reached his shoulders, she told herself she would. If it tangled or matted it would create discomfort, but she felt unsettled by the idea of looming over him with scissors. Most care used spells, but hair was finicky.\nShe didn\u2019t want to give him another Azkaban hack job.\nShe\u2019d do it when he started looking like his father; it would be more than enough reason.\nInstead his long hair accentuated the ways he didn\u2019t look like his father. His features were not so sharp, his mouth flatter, sadder.\nIt made her realise that Draco Malfoy was not just a replica of his father.\nHe was someone else, and his life was slipping by like sand in an hourglass. She didn\u2019t even know if he knew.\nShe started talking to him, not on purpose, it happened eventually, just narration at first, but after so many circular discussions with Lockhart, it was novel to have someone who didn\u2019t interrupt or walk away when she talked about the books she read, her friends, and her research on mind-healing, while she set him up in a chair, combed his hair and enchanted a view.\nShe knew he didn\u2019t really listen.\nWhen his hair reached his elbows she knew she needed to do something. She combed it, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to cut it. It was the only thing about him that reflected the passage of time.\nShe hesitated and then set the scissors down, lacing her fingers through carefully, she braided it down his back, pulling it away from his eyes and tying it off with her hairband.\nShe stepped around and studied him, and then pulled out a mirror, holding it so that he could see his reflection, their faces side-by-side.\n\u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t your father.\u201d\nHis hand twitched, long fingers curling, and she watched his eyes move as if trying to focus.\nHer voice caught in her throat. \u201cMalfoy?\u201d\nThat was all she could say before all the monitors went off, the room filling with sounds and colors. Healers came flooding into the room, and Hermione barely got a word out before he was whisked away.\nBecause if he was responsive that meant his soul was intact, and if his soul was intact it meant he would recover, and if he could recover then that meant he no longer belonged in the Janus Thickey Ward for Permanent Spell Damage.\nHe was gone.\nJust like that.\nBy the end of the day, the room was cleared, cleaned, and waiting for the next long term resident to occupy it.\nHermione resolved not to visit him, even though the miraculous recovery was all the hospital talked about for several days. It was not as if she\u2019d had anything to do with it. Assuming he\u2019d recovered as much as everyone was saying, he wouldn\u2019t be pleased if she showed up acting like they were friends because she\u2019d been his palliative care healer. He probably had no idea at all. He\u2019d be horrified.\nShe had tea with Lockhart and accepted bubblegum wrappers from the Longbottoms, and looked through her mind healing books again, because surely if a sliver of a soul was enough to bring a person back, then a whole lifetime of memories could be restored somehow. Somehow.\n\u201cHe wants to see you,\u201d a very irritated wizard announced, making her jump.\n\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d\n\u201cThe Malfoy boy. Says he wants to see \u2018his healer\u2019 which should me, but it\u2019s apparently not me. And if it\u2019s not me, it should be Jorkins, who is a legend here at St Mungo\u2019s, but it\u2019s not him either. \u2018Granger\u2019, he says, he wants to see \u2018Granger\u2019.\u201d The healer puffed out a breath.\nHermione\u2019s heart was in her throat. \u201cMe? Why?\u201d\nThe healer just waved a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s a toff. We do as he says, we get a new wing in the hospital as thanks.\u201d He glanced at the walls and then emphatically at her. \u201cWe really could use a new wing.\u201d\nHermione gulped and followed him.\nThe healer glanced at her. \u201cSo, how\u2019d you do it?\u201d\nShe stared. \u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cTo bring him back.\u201d\nShe choked at that. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2014 I just cared for him.\u201d\nThe healer stopped short, an odd look on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how it works with souls?\u201d\n\u201cMy specialty is mind-healing.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t come back. The souls. Not after dementors. They could in theory, but they don\u2019t. They unravel completely after a few years.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did Malfoy come back?\u201d\nThe healer shrugged. \u201cThey always say it\u2019s the bastards who never die. Ask him.\u201d\nMalfoy was waiting for her.\nShe was so used to his eyes being blank and unresponsive, it was startling to find him staring at her the moment she entered.\n\u201cGranger,\u201d his voice was faint. Relieved.\nIt\u2019s then she knew that he recognised her, knew her, was aware of the things she\u2019d talked about to him.\nOh god.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cThey said you wanted me.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nA shiver ran down her spine. His hair was still braided with her hair tie.\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d visit eventually,\u201d he said, studying her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI was told you\u2019d be unaware of my care.\u201d\n\u201cI was aware.\u201d\n\u201cAlways?\u201d she asked faintly.\nHe nodded.\n\u201cHow did you come back?\u201d she asked.\nHe looked down. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I meant to fade. I thought I was just another Malfoy, an iteration played over and over, and what would it matter if there was one less? I didn\u2019t know how to do anything but make the same mistakes as my ancestors. To follow their path. But then you of all people were there. I could watch you, listen to you talk. You talk quite a lot. You were fixing your mistakes rather than assuming you\u2019d make them again. I lingered, wanting to know if you could. But I thought, I\u2019m nothing but a reflection of my father, that\u2019s all anyone will ever see in me. But not you.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s heart was pounding.\nHe exhaled and stared at her, eyes burning. \u201cI had came back to show you, you were right.\u201d\n\nAlmost everyone said that Theodore Nott marrying Hermione Granger was unexpected but not surprising. Theo had always been academically insufferable, and Granger was infamously so. The relationship could have almost been called inevitable.\n\n\nEveryone had stories about the absurdly saccharine workplace romance that unfolded. Coworkers by coincidence, they both showed up for a cancelled meeting, the waiting led to a shared project, and from there a whirlwind relationship.\u00a0\n\n\nThey were engaged within a year.\u00a0\n\n\nA beautiful couple, a perfect match. Despite Theo possessing the near fatal flaw of having been in Slytherin, he compensated for any suspicion held by Granger\u2019s friends by having a tragic life story practically from the moment of conception. A mother who\u2019d died horribly young, and a monster of a father who\u2019d always considered his son a bitter disappointment.\u00a0\n\n\nTheo had never taken the Dark Mark, he\u2019d played no part in the war. He was self-deprecating and funny, and knew how to make people like him because he cared about people liking him. The kind of man who was perfectly happy to become \u2018Hermione Granger\u2019s husband,\u2019 unlike the previous boyfriends who always wanted her bright but not \u2018too bright\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco was happy for Theo. In a very detached and uninvolved way. He wasn\u2019t such a cunt that he would resent his best friend for finding love, even if it was with a person he habitually went out of his way to avoid.\u00a0\n\n\nGranger was, after all, a menace with a vicious protective streak, and a known right hook. Draco, in fact, knew it personally. No one was ever going to hurt Theo again, she would make sure of it.\u00a0\n\n\nTheo, for his part, had spent his entire life looking for someone who\u2019d let him love them completely. Someone to give his heart and soul to. His adoration for Granger was nauseating, an ocean of unplumbed depths.\u00a0\n\n\nThe stars seemed to align for them, every piece falling into place to create a perfect match: Two positively revolting swots joined in matrimonial bliss, happy as could be.\n\n\nNo one asked Draco if he wanted to be in excruciating proximity to the entire affair, and yet he somehow was. He helped Theo plan his proposal, and then had to listen to Theo practise his speech over and over without wincing, and then illuminate over five hundred fairy lights, cue a quartet, and then fling a garden\u2019s worth of rose petals into the air, before apparating silently away.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was the best man. He planned Theo\u2019s stag night. Slapped him across the face when he started hyperventilating, kept the rings from getting lost, and signed as witness to the union.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen it was done and they were off on their honeymoon, he left the reception, and went to Greece for six months in order to detox from the entire revolting affair.\n\n\nWhen he finally forced himself to go back, he coddled himself by ignoring most of their invitations, and only accepted the ones where he could arrive late and leave early and barely speak to the hosts.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually Theo stopped bothering him.\n\n\nAfter all, it was bad enough to hear how revoltingly happy they were together without seeing them.\n\n\n\u00a0Malfoys were emotionally repressed on principle. His father used to say that falling in love was something only poor people did.\u00a0\n\n\nIf Draco had to witness Granger making cow eyes at Theo, he would suffer indigestion, and his mother had always said he was constitutionally delicate.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t particularly like company anyway, and Theo\u2019s friends were mostly Granger\u2019s friends, which was not a circle Draco ever felt comfortable in.\u00a0\n\n\nHis uninvolvement was going swimmingly until he received a short, informal note in shaky writing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018I need to see you. Please come. Theo.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\n\nDraco had always been better at refusing formal invitations than personal ones. What the fuck would Theo suddenly want? After all these years?\n\n\nHe tried to ignore it, but the vagueness ate at him, niggling at his curiosity until he gritted his teeth and apparated to Nott manor.\n\n\nInstead of an elf, or a butler at least answering the door it was Granger herself who opened it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMalfoy, you\u2019ve finally come. Theo will be so relieved.\u201d\n\n\nHe swallowed hard.\u00a0\n\n\nIt had been a few years since he\u2019d seen her in person. Wasn\u2019t she supposed to be blissfully married? Weren\u2019t happy people supposed to glow or something?\n\n\nShe\u2019d been glowing at the wedding. Draco remembered all clearly the way her face had lit up when all the lights illuminated and music started, and Theo, despite Draco\u2019s repeated warnings, was on his knees reciting a poem he\u2019d written for her.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco had nearly died from second hand embarrassment.\u00a0\n\n\nThe memory of how happy she\u2019d looked while Theo compared her to the moon in iambic pentameter before hundreds of people, had been seared irrevocably into his skull. It would probably still haunt when he was a ghost.\n\n\nShe was not glowing at all now. She looked sad, and tired.\n\n\n\u201cGranger,\u201d he said, even though he was excruciatingly aware that she was married.\u00a0\n\n\nHe expected her to correct him out of habit, and then he\u2019d retort that she would always be Granger to him, and then they would exchange empty banter and it would pass as conversation, but instead she just said, \u201cTheo\u2019s upstairs,\u201d and led the way.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco expected to be led to a study, or a horrible mad scientist type lab designed for two, but instead it was a dark bedroom.\n\n\nDraco baulked at the doorway, and Granger went in. He could hear the hushed murmur of voices and then she came back.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake and having a good day, call if you need anything.\u201d Then she left him there.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco\u00a0 watched her vanish back down the stairs before setting his jaw and entering the room. Theo was pale as a sheet, propped up with pillows, his face lit up at the sight of Draco.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou did come, you old bastard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said awkwardly. \u201cIs Granger finally poisoning you for your family fortune?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019d prefer to avoid greetings or comments about how long it had been, or asking what was wrong. It was clear that something was incredibly wrong. Theo was thin and greyish, everything about him faded, not at all the picture of health Draco had assumed he would be.\u00a0\n\n\nThat he was\n\n supposed\n\n to be.\u00a0\n\n\nTheo gave a wan smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame her, but no. My mother, you might not remember, it was a maladiction that killed her. Apparently I inherited it. Another thing my father didn\u2019t manage to beat out of me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDraco\u2019s chest clenched. \u201cTheo, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\n\nTheo shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve\u2014worked through it. Mostly. There are stages to grief apparently. That\u2019s what the books say. I\u2019ve moved through denial, anger, bargaining and depression. It\u2019s not entirely a linear process but I\u2019m mostly at the acceptance point now. Figured we should say goodbye.\u201d\n\n\nDraco just stared at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. You invited me here for goodbyes? Fuck off. You can\u2019t just give up like that. You\u2019re married. You have a wife, you can\u2019t die and leave\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\u201cIf there was a fucking cure, Hermione would have found it,\u201d Theo cut him off, his usually soft voice hardening in a defensive way that startled Draco. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked. We\u2019ve tried everything. You\u2019d know that, if you\u2019d ever come around. She\u2019s been trying for years. Admitting she couldn\u2019t\u2014she tried so hard.\u201d\n\n\nDraco felt like he\u2019d been struck. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. Of course you did. I\u2019ve been away. Busy. I have responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\nTheo rolled his eyes, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I know now why you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTheo sat up slowly. His body seemed shrunken, like a breath of wind could carry him away. \u201cThat\u2019s why I needed to see you. I wanted to apologise. I\u2019m sorry for not realising it sooner. I should have. Looking back\u2014it\u2019s so obvious.\u201d\n\n\nDraco forced a laugh. He had no idea what Theo was talking about but he was really not enjoying the conversation.\n\n\n\u201cRealising what? What\u2019s obvious?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat you\u2019re in love with Hermione.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDraco\u2019s entire body went stiff, something inside him crumbled and died as his heart stopped completely. His voice failed him the first several times he tried to speak. He looked away, clearing his throat repeatedly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. You sound mad.\u201d He fidgeted with the potions on Theo\u2019s bedside table, peering at them. \u201cWhat kind of potions does Granger have you on?\u201d\n\n\nTheo slumped back, his eyes fluttering closed, his eyelids looked almost bruised with exhaustion. \u201cI think back a lot. Mostly the years since the war, once my father was gone and things were getting better. I was remembering how much time we used to spend together. You were doing community service for probation, that elves thing Hermione founded. And I was going from one bad relationship to the next like some sad puppy.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cI was remembering how whenever I told you about anyone I dated, you always used to sneer and said they weren\u2019t good enough for me, and gave the worst relationship advice ever. You Sabotaged me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou had terrible taste,\u201d Draco retorted, still sorting through the potions and still not liking at all the direction the conversation was going in. \u201cIt was a mercy on my part.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen I told you about Hermione, that I ran into her, and I asked you what you thought, do you remember what you said?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I do,\u201d Draco lied.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou said I\u2019d never be good enough for her. Then the next week, you came around again, and I remember you looked terrible and I assumed you\u2019d had another fight with your parents, and you told me if I was serious, I should get a job at the Ministry, mentioned the rumour she\u2019d had a time-turner at school. She was the only person you gave useful relationship advice about. Looking back, I don\u2019t think it would have happened without you. Any of it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTheo\u2014\u201c Draco shifted awkwardly, having run out of potions to look at, \u201c\u2014it was just a joke, You can\u2019t assume things like that. Granger? Really? Of anyone I could have feelings for. Your wife?\u201d He exhaled raggedly. \u201cHave you forgotten our history? Unlike you, I \n\nwas\n\n a Death Eater. I was in the war. Even before then, I was awful, and they brought her to the manor and I\u2014\u201c\n\n\nHe\u2019s rambling, he knew he was rambling. He needed to fucking shut up.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI would never have been able to\u2014\u201c His voice failed and there was a stone lodged in the bottom of his throat and he just stood there trying to keep from smashing everything within reach.\u00a0\n\n\nHe needed a drink.\u00a0\n\n\nHe threw a hand up, suddenly angry and turned on Theo, glaring. \u201cIt was just a fucking joke. I don\u2019t even remember it.\u201d\n\n\nTheo simply nodded. \u201cYou were right though. I wasn\u2019t good enough for her.\u201d\n\n\nDraco scoffed at that, turning away, inspecting the view. \u201cI\u2019m sure you did just fine. I always heard that you two were revoltingly happy. People said you were like some storybook couple. You two were good for each other\u2014that\u2019s really all that\u2014\u201c\u00a0\n\n\nHe was stammering again.\n\n\nHe cut himself off. \u201cYou were happy together. Everyone said you made her happy. And I don\u2019t do happiness, it gives me a rash.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Theo\u2019s voice sharpened. \u201cFuck. I forgot how much you talk when you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\n\nHe gave a heavy sigh. \u201cYou wanted us together, didn\u2019t you? You engineered it.\u201d\n\n\nDraco gave a long suffering sigh. \u201cTheo, you\u2019re a moron. Just because you claim to be dying doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to put up with a conspiracy theory that I\u2019m in love with your wife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck off. You were my only friend, and you were the only reason I didn\u2019t accidentally sabotage the relationship. All the times I would have rushed things, you stopped me. You were the reason why I managed to pull off all my harebrain romantic schemes. You made it work. And somehow I ended up married with the friends and family I always wanted, that you knew I wanted, and where the fuck did you go? Where have you been since then? Not here, that's for sure.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDraco glanced out the window. \u201cYou wanted a new start, Theo. It was all you talked about once your father was in Azkaban. I was the past. Once you were married, you didn\u2019t need me anymore. I was a hindrance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou manipulated me,\u201d Theo said, looking unreasonably infuriated for someone who\u2019d gotten to marry the love of his life. \u201cYou self-loathing fuck. You thought you had it all worked out, had everything puppet-mastered. You nudged me right into her path to love her for you. Pushed us together so you would be alone the way you\u2019ve convinced yourself you deserve to be.\u201d He sounded winded. \u201cFuck. I\u2019d punch you if I had the strength. And the thing I\u2019m the most pissed off about, is that I was so enamoured, I didn\u2019t notice. I thought it all worked perfectly that time because it was meant to.\u201d\n\n\nIf Theo was expecting a confession he was going to be terribly disappointed.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe it did. I don\u2019t know what you expect me to say about any of this. Even if any of that were true, what does it matter?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d Theo said.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt matters because you have to take care of her when I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\n\nDraco\u2019s heart stalled for a second time, but he recovered faster. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can get everything arranged in advance so she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now. I can\u2019t ask her friends to do this. They love her, but they don\u2019t understand how to care for her. She takes care of everyone, but she doesn\u2019t remember to take care of herself. She needs someone to be selfish for her, who will do whatever it takes to put her first. I can\u2019t be your proxy anymore, it has to be you now.\u201d\n\n\nDraco\u2019s neatly manicured nails were biting into his palm, he didn\u2019t even know when his fists had clenched. \u201cTheo\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have spent so much time worrying about her, feeling like I can\u2019t go because who\u2019d be here to make sure she was alright. I\u2019ve considered everyone, and when I got to you, I brushed you off at first, because you used to talk about how you couldn\u2019t stand her. But eventually I wondered, why did you do so much to bring us together? If you really hated her so much. You always knew what she\u2019d like. You figured things out about her that it took me ages to piece together. And you\u2019re actually a rather shit liar, now that I\u2019ve been thinking about it, if you\u2019d really hated her, you would have been a lot nastier than you were.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see the point in this conversation,\u201d Draco said in a bored tone. \u201cGranger can take care of herself. Especially with your fortune.\u201d\n\n\nTheo exhaled, like he was too tired now to fight anymore. \u201cYou are missing the point on purpose and we both know it.\u201d\n\n\nDraco did not know any such thing, still it was difficult to keep looking at Theo and he turned away.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou did a good job at it. I\u2019ll admit, you are the manipulative person I have ever known, if I weren\u2019t dying, I probably would have never known. But now it\u2019s my turn to be manipulative.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell a good rule of thumb is not to tell the person you\u2019re trying to manipulate that you\u2019re doing it,\u201d Draco said in a dry voice, turning to face him.\u00a0\n\n\nTheo was holding up his wand and had a wry smile on his face. \u201cFair enough. But I do have one final piece of leverage.\u201d\n\n\nComprehension slowly dawned on him. \u201cTheo, don\u2019t you\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy, it is my dying wish that you care for my wife when I am gone. Support her in her grief, and help her find joy in her future. Be there for her once I can\u2019t be. Help her find herself again. Do you accept?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDeath Wishes were magic out of old grimoires. The kind that only insufferable people like Theo Nott would know how to perform.\u00a0\n\n\nUsually they were curses pronounced as the person died, but a rare iteration was rather like an Unbreakable Vow. If Draco refused, Theo would not pass on after death but instead linger as a ghost, attempting to fulfil the wish himself. If Draco accepted and then broke his word, Theo would come back from the afterlife and haunt him.\u00a0\n\n\nBullshit all around either way.\u00a0\n\n\nTheo\u2019s wand pulsed with magic, waiting for Draco\u2019s answer.\u00a0\n\n\nDraco stood glaring at him. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\nTheo glared right back. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t such a self-sabotaging, self-loathing moron I wouldn\u2019t have to do this. You think I want you hanging around my wife? I don\u2019t. But being your proxy was also a shit realisation, consider this my way of getting even. You will make Hermione happy and you will get over your self-hatred and do it yourself this time or I will haunt you and I will make sure Hermione knows exactly why it is that I\u2019m doing it. Do you accept?\u201d\n\n\nThe magic was humming louder, growing brighter, and Theo was beginning to turn translucent as though the power was draining the remaining life from him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFine. Yes! I accept.\u201d\n\n\nThe magic flared out and flew across the room, striking Draco and fading into him. He clutched at his chest but the light had gone.\u00a0\n\n\nHe looked up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFuck you, you manipulative bastard,\u201d Draco finally said, his heart was pounding.\n\n\nTheo just gave another wry smile. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to say when you walked in.\u201d He sank back into bed, looking winded. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came to see me. I was starting to worry you wouldn\u2019t and I was going to have to come up with a whole extra scheme. You saved me a lot of trouble. All worth it for Hermione though, right?\u201d\n\n\nDraco turned without another word and headed toward the door, desperate to be gone, even though he could feel Theo\u2019s wish like a brand inside his soul, waiting to come alive.\n\n\n\u201cYou should go see Hermione,\u201d Theo\u2019s voice followed him, already threatening to haunt him. \u201cYou know, she admitted once to fancying you a bit back when you were volunteering at the charity. She\u2019d planned to ask you out, but you never came around after your probation was over.\u201d\n"
